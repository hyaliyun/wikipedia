It has an onset of 4 to 6 hours, a peak of 14 to 24 hours, and a duration of 28 to 36 hours.Gomella LG, Haist SA. Chapter 22. Commonly Used Medications. In: Gomella LG, Haist SA, eds. Clinician's Pocket Reference: The Scut Monkey. 11th ed. New York: McGraw- Hill; 2007. http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=2696124. Accessed February 4, 2012 Ultralente insulin, along with lente insulin, were discontinued in the US by manufacturers in the mid-2000s. One of the reasons for discontinuation was declining use in favor of NPH insulin and other newer insulin products. The FDA withdrew approval for ultralente insulin products by 2011. History Insulin which was extracted from animal sources was used as a medicine as early as 1922. These early insulin preparations required multiple daily injections due to the short duration of action and quick degradation of the insulin protein. For this reason, researchers began studying how to prolong the effects of injected insulin. In 1952, a team at Novo Terapeutisk led by K. Hallas-Møller discovered that crystals of various sizes would form when zinc was added to insulin suspensions. Larger insulin crystals take longer to dissolve into the bloodstream when injected into the body, and as such have a much longer duration of action than amorphous or small insulin crystals. Ultralente insulin was considered to be a \\"long- acting\\" insulin that could be used once per day to provide a basal level of insulin, similar to some protamine-containing preparations. While originally isolated from bovine or porcine sources, the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the 1980s allowed human insulin to be mass produced in yeast or bacteria. By the mid 1990s, ultralente insulin was being prepared from recombinant human insulin, instead of insulin extracted from animals. The advent of insulin analogues and continued use of NPH insulin led to the discontinuation of ultralente insulin products in the mid-2000s, and FDA approval to be marketed in the US was withdrawn by 2011.Federal Register Doc. E9-2901Federal Register Doc. 2011-14164 Lente insulin was a combination of ultralente insulin and amorphous, or plain, insulin in a fixed percentage combination. Ultralente insulin comprises 65% of the lente insulin preparation Vetsulin®/Caninsulin® which is produced by Merck Animal Health for veterinary use. Adverse effects = Hypoglycemia = The primary adverse effect of any insulin product is hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia can manifest as dizziness, disorientation, trouble speaking, and changes in mental status. In severe cases, hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness if not treated. As lente insulin continues to be absorbed in the body for hours after use, these signs and symptoms may be delayed from the time of administration and begin with little or no warning. = Hypersensitivity = Lente insulin is a combination of porcine and bovine insulin products which are filtered and combined with zinc to form the suspension. Even product that is filtered very well is still of animal origin, and there is a chance the body may recognize the foreign protein as such and form antibodies against it. These reactions are slightly more likely with lente insulin than with insulin derived from a single source as lente insulin contains bovine insulin which is more immunogenic than porcine insulin. Society and culture Historical brand names of ultralente insulin, all of which are now discontinued, included Ultratard HM, Humulin U, and Novolin U.

It was originally released in three parts, all of which were long thought to be lost until portions of the second part and much of the third part were discovered and restored in 1991. Since the film had once been voted in a 1959 Kinema Junpō poll as the best Japanese film of all time, its discovery was significant. At the time of its release, Itō was the leader of a new style of samurai films that featured outlaw heroes and fast- cut sword fighting scenes. Plot The three films focus on the travels of the kindly yakuza boss Kunisada Chūji. The existing print begins with Chuji on the road, fleeing the law while taking care of Kantaro, the son of a dead friend. He leaves Kantaro with Kabe Yasuemon, an honorable local boss, but is shocked to find out that his own men have been committing robberies using his own name. Angry, Chuji hits the road and eventually settles in another town, assuming another name and working as a clerk for a sake brewery. Okuma, the daughter of the brewer, falls in love with Chuji, but he ignores her. When he saves her brother from trouble with the Otozo gang, his identity is revealed and the police close in. Okume kills herself and Chuji flees, but the palsy he had been suffering from worsens and he is finally caught. His henchmen, however, succeed in rescuing him and bring him back to his home village. Unable to walk and confined to bed, Chuji is hidden in a storehouse. His woman, Oshina, discovers that one of his men has betrayed him, but it is too late. Despite the valiant efforts of his men to hold off the police, Chuji is finally arrested by the authorities.

The Act also established a licensing regime and a regulator for the industry called the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER), which has since become the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM).  Background  The liberalisation and privatisation of the energy markets in the United Kingdom began with the Margaret Thatcher Government in the 1980s. This has been called the Thatcher-Lawson agenda, due to the key role of Nigel Lawson the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1983–89) in the Thatcher cabinet. The Government recognised that the electricity industries in Europe and the United States operated successfully under private ownership. In contrast the Central Electricity Generating Board was seen as ‘inflexible, bureaucratic, secretive and largely outside of political control’. Proposals for the privatisation of the electricity industry were published in 1988. Nuclear plant and 60 percent of conventional generation was to be vested in a large company ‘Big G’, the remaining conventional plant in ‘Little G’. However, the government were unable to sell the nuclear plant. The CEGB was therefore split into four companies: PowerGen, National Power, Nuclear Electric and National Grid Company. The privatisation of the electricity supply industries was enacted by the Electricity Act 1989.  Electricity Act 1989  The Electricity Act 1989 received Royal Assent on 27 July 1989. The long title of the Act is ‘An Act to provide for the appointment and functions of a Director General of Electricity Supply and of consumers' committees for the electricity supply industry; to make new provision with respect to the supply of electricity through electric lines and the generation and transmission of electricity for such supply; to abolish the Electricity Consumers' Council and the Consultative Councils established under the Electricity Act 1947; to provide for the vesting of the property, rights and liabilities of the Electricity Boards and the Electricity Council in companies nominated by the Secretary of State and the subsequent dissolution of those Boards and that Council; to provide for the giving of financial assistance in connection with the storage and reprocessing of nuclear fuel, the treatment, storage and disposal of radioactive waste and the decommissioning of nuclear installations; to amend the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 and the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973; and for connected purposes’. = Provisions = The provisions of the Act comprise 113 Sections in three parts, plus 18 Schedules Part I Electricity Supply Introductory – Sections 1 to 3 – including the establishment of the Director General of Electricity Supply; Consumer's Committees; and general duties of the Secretary of State and the Director Licensing of supply etc. – Sections 4 to 10 – including prohibition of unlicensed supply; licences authorising supply; conditions of licences; general duties and powers of licence holders Modification of licenses – Sections 11 to 15 – modification by agreement; Monopolies Commission; reports; and by order Supply by public electricity suppliers – Sections 16 to 24 – duty to supply; exceptions; power to recover charges, expenditure and to require security; terms of supply; agreements; disputes; electricity supply code Enforcement of provisions – Sections 25 to 28 – orders; procedures; validity; power to require information Provisions with respect to supply – Sections 29 to 31 – regulations; inspectors; meters Protection of public interest – Sections 32 to 38 – non-fossil fuels; levy; fuel stocks; consent to construct; overhead lines; amenity and fisheries Consumer protection – Sections 39 to 42 – performance; efficient use; information on performance Consumer protection – Sections 43 to 44 – competition; maximum charges Investigation of complaints – Sections 45 and 46 – enforcement and other matters Other functions of Director – Sections 47 to 50 – general; publication of information; register; annual reports Provisions with respect to Committees – Sections 51 to 53 – duties; reports; National Committee Provisions with respect to Consumers’ etc. Councils – Sections 54 to 56 – Abolition; compensation; continuity of employment Miscellaneous – Sections 57 to 59 – disclosure; restricting information; false statements Supplemental – Sections 60 to 64 – power to make regulations; public inquiries; Crown land; interpretation Part II Reorganisation of the industry Transfers to successor companies – Sections 64 to 70 Ownership of successor companies – Sections 71 to 74 Finances of successor companies – Sections 75 to 81 Provisions with respect to flotation – Sections 82 and 83 Provisions with respect to existing bodies – Sections 84 and 88 Miscellaneous – Sections 89 to 92 Supplemental – Sections 93 to 95 Part III Miscellaneous and Supplemental Miscellaneous – Sections 96 to 99 Amendment of enactments – Sections 100 to 103 Amendment etc. of pension schemes – Sections 104 and 105 Supplemental – Sections 106 to 113 Schedules Schedules 1 to 18 = Effects of the Act = In England and Wales the electricity generating and transmission functions of the Central Electricity Generating Board were divided on 31 March 1990 into three new companies, namely: PowerGen, National Power and National Grid Company. Later, the nuclear facilities within National Power was separated and vested in another state-owned company called Nuclear Electric. The public were offered shares in 60 percent of both National Power and PowerGen in 1991, the remaining shares were offered to the public in 1995. These companies have subsequently been subject to acquisitions, mergers, de-mergers and rebranding. From 31 March 1990 the regional electricity distribution and sales functions of twelve area electricity boards were vested in independent regional electricity companies (RECs). For example, the London Electricity Board was vested in London Electricity plc, and the North Western Electricity Board in Norweb plc. At first the RECs jointly owned the National Grid; they floated the National Grid Company on the stock market in late 1995. The RECs were floated on the stock market on 11 December 1990. Most of the companies have since been acquired by other utility companies. The Electricity Council and its coordinating and policy-making functions were abolished by the 1989 Act. Although a residuary body, the Electricity Association, continued to operate for a few years. Section 1 of the 1989 Act established the Director General of Electricity Supply and the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER). This was an economic regulator independent of government, but accountable to Parliament. This arrangement separated the regulatory decisions from political control and aimed to provide greater long term regulatory certainty and to encourage market entry and investment. Coordination of generation, transmission and distribution was achieved through the establishment of a wholesale pool operated by the National Grid Company. The electricity generators are paid the pool purchase price and users pay the pool selling price. The pool operator ranks the generators by their offer price and establishes a merit order according to the time of day and estimates of demand to set a market clearing price. In Scotland, unlike in England and Wales, the electricity industry was already organised as an integrated generation, distribution, and supply structure. There were two electricity boards: the South of Scotland Electricity Board and the North of Scotland Hydro-electric Board. North of Scotland Electricity plc was formed on 1 April 1989 to acquire the assets the North of Scotland Board ahead of privatisation, the name was later changed to Scottish Hydro-Electric plc. The Board was dissolved in March 1990 and privatised in June 1991. Upon privatisation ScottishPower was created in 1990 largely from the South of Scotland Electricity Board. The nuclear power stations in Scotland (Hunterston A and B and Torness) were vested in Scottish Nuclear. The 1989 Act does not apply to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Limited (NIE Networks) is the electricity asset owner of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in Northern Ireland, it was established in 1993 when the business was privatised. The 1989 Act repealed the Electric Lighting Acts dating from 1882, the Electricity (Supply) Acts 1919 and 1926, the Electricity Acts 1947, 1957 and 1972.  Later amending Acts  Section 1 of the Utilities Act 2000 established the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) which merged and abolished the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER) and Office of Gas Supply (OFGAS). The Act also amended sections of Electricity Act 1989: these included those relating to electricity licensing; the duties of electricity distributors; the electricity code and metering; the powers of electricity licence holders; electricity performance standards; enforcement of obligations; remuneration and service standards; electricity from renewable sources; and some miscellaneous provisions. The Energy Act 2004 established the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and defined responsibilities for the decommissioning and cleaning up of civil nuclear installations and sites. Sections 3A, 29, 30, 43, 58, 64, and 98 of the 1989 Act were amended by Section 147 of the 2004 Act. Schedule 12 of the 1989 Act was amended by section 34 of the 2004 Act. The Energy Act 2008 established a renewables obligation for generating electricity from renewable sources; made provisions for the decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear sites; and the provision of smart meters. The Energy Act 2010 required the Government to prepare reports on the progress made on the decarbonisation of electricity generation in Britain and the development and use of Carbon Capture and Storage; and to create schemes for energy suppliers to give benefits to customers to reduce fuel poverty.

Life and work Bernard Auguste Rives was born 16 September 1858 in Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in the Aquitaine region of France. His parents were Pierre Rives and Victoire Etchart. In 1876, he went to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts under Louis-Jules André and Eugène Train.Dictionnaire par noms d’architectes des constructions élevées à Paris aux XIXe et XXe siècles, 1876-1899, vol. IV, Paris, 1996, p. 65. In addition to designing many apartment and office buildings throughout Paris in the 1880s and 1890s, Rives enlarged and embellished the Grands Magasins Dufayel in Montmartre, with a dome and an unusual curving staircase, as well as large spaces for displaying merchandise.La Construction Moderne, 1899-1900, vol. 15. thumb thumb Rives also built a house on the Champs-Elysées for the store's founder, Georges Dufayel. After the death of Dufayel in 1916, this house was used as a press club during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919“Oil Giants Buy French Palaces,“ New York Times, December 8, 1920, p. 9. (it was demolished in the 1920s to make way for a shopping arcade). Also in collaboration with Georges Dufayel, Rives created at least two major resort buildings for Sainte-Adresse, in Normandy, in the quartier known as Le Nice-Havrais. One, the Immeuble Dufayel, a residential building, still stands. The other, l'Hotellerie, was used as the headquarters for the Belgian government in exile during the First World War, and was demolished by the occupying German army in the Second World War.Information provided by the Association pour le Patrimoine de Sainte- Adresse (APSA). thumb Rives served as architect for the Crédit Foncier of Algeria, the Société Foncière Lyonnaise, and the Compagnie d'Assurances Générales. He also designed several hotels for the town of Menton on the Riviera.Dictionnaire par noms d’architectes des constructions élevées à Paris aux XIXe et XXe siècles, 1876-1899, vol. IV, Paris, 1996, p. 66. A large part of his work was the design of rental apartment buildings in Paris. His work was recognized by the City of Paris in the Concours des Façades in 1899, when he won a prize for a building at 45, rue du Chateau d’Eau in the 10th arrondissement.Monique Eleb & Anne Debarre, L’invention de l’habitation moderne: Paris 1880-1914, Paris: Editions Hazan, 1995, p. 511. Another prominent Paris building was the Hotel Astoria on the Champs-Elysées, built in 1907. Some critics complained that its high domes detracted from the view of the Arc de Triomphe nearby.Félix de Rochegude, Promenades dans toutes les rues de Paris: VIIIe arrondissement (Hachette, 1910): « l’élévation exagérée et agressive de cet hôtel détruit la belle harmonie de la place de l’Étoile. » (The exaggerated and aggressive elevation of this hotel destroys the beautiful harmony of the place de l’Etoile.) This building was destroyed by fire in 1972. Between 1901 and 1910, Rives was manager and organizer for special events at the Grand Palais in Paris, particularly the popular automobile and aeronautical shows. For each one, he designed elaborate temporary decorations.Gilles Plum, Le Grand Palais, Editions du Patrimoine, 2005, p. 166. The aeronautical show was a spin-off from the auto shows: :In 1908 during the 11th Paris Motor Show… that show’s organizer, Gustave Rives, set up an aeronautical exhibition for the few flying machines in France at that time. The success of the aeronautical display at the automobile show led the next year to the “Exposition de la Locomotion Aerienne,” a full exhibition of aircraft with 380 exhibitors and some 100,000 visitors. The show was hosted by France’s first aerospace industries’ trade association, the Chambre Syndicale de L’industrie Aeronautique, created by pioneer aircraft manufacturers such as Louis Bleriot, Louis-Charles Breguet and Gabriel Voisin. The aircraft were floated on barges up the Seine and carried on horse-drawn wagons to the Grand Palais.Douglas Nelms, “An Auspicious Occasion: Paris Celebrates 100 Years of Air Shows,” Rotor and Wing Magazine, June 1, 2009. Rives published substantial reports on these shows. He also redesigned the interior of the French Automobile Club on the Place de la Concorde in Paris. Gustave Rives was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1908 and held the post of Chief Architect of the City of Paris and Directeur des Palais civils et nationaux. In 1885, Rives married Jeanne-Gabrielle de Lavaysse (1865–1942), and had three children: Edouard Roger Marcel (b. 1886), Jean Angèly Georges (1889-1964), and Germaine (b. c1892).

Retrieved on September 4, 2012. born September 19, 1994) is an American football defensive end who is currently a free agent. He attended the University of Mississippi for three years until declaring early for the 2016 NFL Draft where he was picked 29th overall by the Arizona Cardinals. Regarded by ESPN as the \\"Southeast's best [high school football] prospect since the early 1980s,\\" Nkemdiche was the highest touted prospect committing to the Ole Miss Rebels since Eli Manning in 1999. High school career A native of Loganville, Georgia, Nkemdiche attended Grayson High School, where he was a three-sport athlete in football, basketball, and track. He played as a defensive end and running back for the Grayson Rams high school football team. In his junior season, he registered 59 tackles and 18 sacks on defense while also running for 528 yards and scoring 17 touchdowns on offense. Grayson High School went undefeated throughout the season, finishing 15–0 with a GHSA 6A state title win over Marietta Walton. In his senior year, Nkemdiche registered 59 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, and seven sacks on defense, while on offense, he had 235 total rushing yards and 10 touchdowns. Early in the season, Grayson defeated Dalvin Cook's Miami (FL) Central 35–3 in a game that was nationally televised on ESPN. The Rams went on to a 10–2 season record, and were upset by Mitch Hyatt's North Gwinnett in the second round of the GHSA 6A state playoffs. Nkemdiche was the Gwinnett Daily Post Defensive Player of the Year. He finished his career at Grayson with 41 career sacks. He was named first-team All-American as a junior by MaxPreps, as well as second-team as a senior. In addition, Nkemdiche in track & field during his junior season.

In addition, he had marks of a 350-pound max bench press, 335-pound power clean, 500-pound squat, and a 4.56-second 40-yard dash time. =Recruiting= Regarded as a five-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Nkemdiche was not only considered the No. 1 defensive line prospect of his class, but also the consensus No. 1 player overall. He was only the fourth player since 2002 to be the consensus No. 1 prospect, along with Jadeveon Clowney, Vince Young, and Ernie Sims. Nkemdiche went wire-to-wire as the No. 1 overall player in the Rivals.com Top100, also the first since Clowney. Robert and his older brother, Denzel, originally planned attending college together. After Denzel Nkemdiche signed with Ole Miss, Robert was believed to follow. However, he instead committed to Clemson on June 14, 2012. In October 2012, ESPN The Magazine reported that Nkemdiche was not firm on his non-binding verbal commitment, and was still considering other schools, including Ole Miss. Consequently, Nkemdiche decommitted from Clemson in November 2012, re-considering a number of schools including Clemson, Ole Miss, Alabama, and Georgia. By January 2013, he narrowed his list down to just Ole Miss and Louisiana State.Robert Nkemdiche: Ole Miss still leads for nation’s undisputed No. 1 prospect Giving her opinion on their sons' college selection, Nkemdiche's mother said she would \\"love for them to play together, as well as have the power of two.\\" That way, she would not have to worry about going to different games—taking pressure off of her shoulders. Also, on top of the family tie to Ole Miss, Nkemdiche was said to have a close relationship with the head coach of the Ole Miss football team, Hugh Freeze. In November 2012, Denzel Nkemdiche told reporters that Robert personally told him that he was going to commit to Ole Miss.Ole Miss nabbing #1 recruit Nkemdiche would be icing on the cake Robert Nkemdiche indeed committed to Ole Miss on National Signing Day to play college football under head coach Hugh Freeze. College career One of the most highly touted recruits in the program's history, Nkemdiche arrived at Ole Miss with plenty of hype, being named SEC’s Top Impact Freshman by Sporting News before the season. He played in 11 games with 10 starts (six at defensive end and four at defensive tackle), and amassed 34 tackles (25 solo), 2.0 sacks, two pass breakups, and three quarterback hurries on the 2013 season. Nkemdiche made his college debut against conference opponent Vanderbilt, posting two tackles with a tackle-for- loss and a pass break-up. He missed the Louisiana State and Idaho games with a strained hamstring. After the season, Nkemdiche was named Freshman All-SEC by the league's coaches, and a First team Freshman All-American selection by Athlon and College Football News. As a sophomore, Nkemdiche started every game at the defensive tackle position on an Ole Miss defensive line that led the nation in scoring defense (16.0 ppg) and lead the SEC in tackles for loss (7.6/game). Nkemdiche himself contributed 35 tackles with 4.0 tackles-for- loss, 2.0 sacks, and a pass breakup on the season. His best game was against in-state rival Mississippi State, in which he was credited for a career-high seven tackles, of which three were solo, and one tackle-for-a-loss. Nkemdiche was a semifinalist for the Lombardi Award and was named All-SEC first team by Associated Press (AP), as well as All-America second team by AP, Sporting News, USA Today, and CBS Sports.

Structure  The four movements are listed as: These four études are focused on difficult and irregular rhythmical structures for pianists, countering tuplets with other rhythmically regular forms or other rhythmical structures that involve certain difficulty for performers. The first étude in C minor, dedicated to E. Mitusov, consists of a regular with triplets against quintuplets or even septuplets at some point. The second étude in D major, dedicated to Nicolas Richter, is in and opposes sixteenth notes against quadruplets and quintuplets. The third in E minor, dedicated to Andrey Rimsky-Korsakov, doesn't require much effort or experience in polyrhythm, while the long legato melody is in the middle voice and the accompaniment figures are in the upper registers. The main trait of the fourth étude in F-sharp major, which is dedicated to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, is its syncopation, present throughout the étude. Although much of this music is still derivative of Chopin, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky’s own voice asserts itself in the percussive final étude.

He was a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School (1958–1985) and was also a university administrator. From 1971 to 1980, he was dean of medicine, and then deputy vice-chancellor at the University of London. However his greatest contribution was to question current standards of prenatal care. He was critical of the way that midwives and obstetricians treated women, and his work was summarized in a paper in the Lancet in 1960. This paper was based on interviews with 500 women, included no references and at the time was extremely controversial. In 2007, the Lancet included this paper in the '200 most important publications in the Lancet'. Early life and education Morris was born in 1920 in Luton. His father, Frederick, was a Nalgo shop steward. His mother Evelyn was a teacher and was a great influence in his life. He was headboy of Dunstable Grammar school and was selected by Lord Moran to become a medical student at St Mary's Hospital Medical School. It was at St Mary's, he was taught and guided by the Medical Reformer Alec Bourne, the Gynaecologist responsible for the Abortion Act. He spent the early war years as an ARP warden with Sir Alexander Fleming. After qualification, he worked in Amersham and then in the East End of London. Career Morris held junior posts in obstetrics and gynaecology at St Mary's. He was first assistant at Hammersmith Hospital and became reader at University College Hospital. In 1958, he was appointed professor of obstetrics and gynaecology. He was the first clinical professor at Charing Cross. His initial research interest was hypertension in pregnancy. He published a series of papers on uterine blood flow and was the first obstetrician to show that there was reduced blood flow in the uterus in women who subsequently developed pre- eclampsia. At Charing Cross he developed a clinical and basic science research programme. He was the first obstetrician to introduce fathers to the labour ward and built a labour ward without the traditional first and second stage rooms. Staff were encouraged to attend Balint style department meetings. He worked closely with Emanual Lewis, a psychiatrist and pediatrician Dr Hugh Jolly. SANDS was founded from these meetings. The first water birth was carried out at Charing Cross in the 1970s. Dr Frederick Leboyer came to work with Morris. Charing Cross moved from its base in Covent Carden to West London in 1972, where major changes in obstetric care were developed. He was also a campaigner for medical academics and established AUCAS. a pressure group that achieved parity of pay for university doctors. He set up a campaign to allow Jewish doctors from Russia to emigrate and develop careers in the UK and Israel. He trained professors in the UK, America, Europe and India. He was a founder and first president of the International Society of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology. He was president of the Division of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Section at the Royal Society of Medicine and the West London Medico-Chirological Society. He was deputy chairman of the Northwest Thames Health Authority and chairman of the regional research committee. He was the deputy chair of the Flowers Report. He was a visiting professor to 27 universities. He retired from the National Health Service (NHS) in 1985 and became medical director of the IVF unit at Cromwell Hospital. He was the director of the Commonwealth Health secretariat. At age 80, he established postgraduate courses for the MRCS and the MRCP. He continued to work until his death in 2008. Personal life In 1944, as a junior doctor, he met Dr Benjamin Rivlin, a local GP, originally from Latvia. In 1945, he married Rivlin's daughter Lucy. The couple were married for over 60 years and had four children, all of whom became doctors. His life was celebrated at the Royal College of Obstetricians in 2008; speakers included politician Tony Benn, and diplomat Emeka Anyoka. The eulogy was read by Australian actor and comedian Barry Humphries (in the guise of Dame Edna Everage).

He was defeated first by Sîn-muballiṭ of Babylon (c. 1748 – 1729 BC) and then later by Rīm-Sîn I of Larsa (c. 1758 – 1699 BC). Biography His standard inscription characterizes him as the \\"farmer who piles up the produce (of the land) in granaries.\\" Four royal inscriptions are extant including cones celebrating the building of the wall of Isin, naming him as “Damiq-ilišu is the favorite of the god Ninurta” also recollected in a year-name and “suitable for the office of en priest befitting the goddess Inanna.”HS 2008 & CBS 9999 (Nippur), IB 1090 (Isin).

A cone records the construction of a temple, the é-ki-tuš-bi-du10, “House – its residence is good,” possibly for the deity Nergal of Uṣarpara. There is also a palace inscription and a copy of a dedication to Nergal of Apiak on a votive lion sculpture. Seal of Dakiya, son of Damiq-ilishu, as a high official of Samsu-iluna, after the loss of his father's kingdom. An outline of the political events can be gleaned from an examination of the year names of the rival kingdoms. Rīm-Sîn’s year 14 (c. 1744 BC) records “Year the armies of Uruk, Isin, Babylon, Sutum, Rapiqum, and of Irdanene,Alternative reading of the name: Irnene. the king of Uruk, were smitten with weapons.” This victory over a grand coalition seems to have awakened in Rīm-Sîn imperial ambitions. Damiq-ilišu’s year 13 (c. 1739 BC) records the “Year in which (Damiq-ilišu) built the great city wall of Isin (called) 'Damiq-ilišu-hegal’ (Damiq-ilišu is abundance)”. The holy city of Nippur seems to have been wrestled from the control of Larsa around 1749 BC by Damiq-ilīšu who held it until Rīm-Sîn reclaimed it around 1737 BC, the year he “destroyed Uruk,” based upon the dating of documents found there. Sin-muballit’s year 13 (c. 1735 BC) is called “Year the troops and the army of Larsa were smitten by weapons.” Rīm-Sîn’s year 25 (c. 1733 BC) is named “Year the righteous shepherd Rim-Sin with the powerful help of An, Enlil, and Enki seized the city of Damiq-ilišu, brought its inhabitants who had helped Isin as prisoners to Larsa, and established his triumph greater than before.” This setback seems to have crippled the tottering Isin state enabling Sîn-muballiṭ of Babylon to pillage the city in 1732 BC, during his year 16.Year 16 of Sîn-muballiṭ as recorded at CDLI, Fitzgerald says year 17. Rīm-Sîn’s year 29 (1729) recalls “Year in which Rīm- Sîn the righteous shepherd with the help of the mighty strength of An, Enlil, and Enki seized in one day Dunnum the largest city of Isin and submitted to his orders all the drafted soldiers but he did not remove the population from its dwelling place.” His year 30 (c. 1728 BC) reads “Year Rīm-Sîn the true shepherd with the strong weapon of An, Enlil, and Enki seized Isin, the royal capital and the various villages, but spared the life of its inhabitants, and made great for ever the fame of his kingship.” The event was considered so significant that from then on every year-name of Rīm-Sîn was named after it: the first year after the sack of Isin until “Year 31 after he seized Isin.” The Weidner Chronicle,Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19). also called the Esagila Chronicle, is an apocryphal historiographical or supposititious letter composed in the name of Damiq-ilišu who addresses Apil-Sîn of Babylon (c. 1767 - 1749 BC) discussing the merits of offerings made to Marduk on their donors. There is also a belle letter from Damiq-ilīšu to the god Nuska. He seems to have become something of a folk-hero, because later kings hark back to him and describe themselves as his successor. The Sealand Dynasty seems to have considered itself the inheritor of the neo-Sumerian beacon and the 3rd king, Damqi-ilišu, even took his name. The founder of the 2nd Sealand Dynasty, Simbar-Šipak (c. 1025-1008 BC), was described as “soldier of the dynasty of Damiq-ilišu,” in a historical chronicle.Dynastic Chronicle (ABC 18) v 3.

Published by Taylor and Francis. The company was renamed as the Dublin and Lucan Electric Railway Company and steam power was replaced by electricity in 1897. This service ran until 1925. Dublin and Lucan Steam Tramway The first public reference to this tramway scheme was in the Irish Times on 19 April 1880, wherein it was reported that the County Dublin Grand Jury had a proposal before them for the building of the line.Irish Times, 19 April 1880 The Dublin and Lucan Steam Tramway (DLST) was authorised by an Order in Council under the Tramways Act. A prospectus appeared in the Irish Times on 27 November 1880. The capital was £30,000, comprising 3,000 shares of £10 each, with borrowing powers of £10,000 on the debentures. The board of management comprised: *Colonel Charles Colthurst Vesey, D.L., J.P. (Chairman) (Lucan House) *William Moran, J.P. (Vice Chairman) (St. Edmundsbury, Lucan) *James Macken (of James Macken and Sons, Dublin and Chapelizod) *John A. Walker (Trinity Street, Dublin) Construction commenced on 23 December 1880 and work progressed rapidly such that construction to Chapelizod was complete mostly by 23 May 1881. Mostly on a roadside reservation, the initial services began to Chapelizod on 1 June 1881. One of the steam trams they obtained was from the Nottingham company of Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. to the patented design of Edward Perrett. It was delivered on a trial basis in the hope of inducing its purchase by the company. This vehicle was a double decker of 2-4-2 type, with vertical coke-fired boilers on the end platforms. The two cylinders and engine were positioned beneath the floor of the saloon. The vehicle weight was 9 tons (with passengers 10½ tons), and the price was £950. By the time of the first half-yearly meeting of the new company on 5 July 1881, construction had reached Palmerstown and services began in November 1881. Two additional engines had been ordered from Kitson and Company, as well as passenger vehicles and wagons. A depot was completed at Conyngham Road, opposite the terminus, on land known as the Long Meadows. There was some difficulty in the finance for the remaining section of the line. Eventually a loan of £10,000 was negotiated with the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland and services began to Lucan on 20 February 1883. On 11 August 1883 there was a fatal accident when Patrick Meade was badly injured after being partly run over. The driver, Thomas Barber and the conductor Michael Ward were charged with \\"the careless management of a steam tramway\\". At the inquest, it was learned that Barber had been swinging between two passenger carriages, and had fallen. The driver and conductor were exonerated.The Dublin, Lucan and Leixlip Steam Tramways and Electric Railways, Alan T. Newham, The Tramway Review, Vol. 4, No. 32, 1962 The tramway was a victim of its own success. By 27 August, the company was attracting passengers beyond its capacity. It was stated that on some days, 200 people were left behind at Chapelizod for lack of room, despite 34 double journeys having been worked. Additional vehicles could not be obtained quickly from manufacturers due to heavy demand from companies in England resulting in a 5-month lead time for delivery. By 1895 the tramway was in poor condition and the track needed relaying. Much damage had been done by vehicles other than the tramway engines, and it was decided to reconstruct the track on a raised formation above road level. =Lucan and Leixlip Steam Tramway= The Lucan, Leixlip and Celbridge Steam Tramway Company was established to build lines from the Lucan terminus to Leixlip and Celbridge (branching off just outside Leixlip). The principal promoters were Alexander Ward and Robert Parker Birkett, the concern having five directors. The capital was £25,000. The Lucan and Leixlip Steam Tramway (L&LST;) extension was built, and operated between 1890 and 1898. Construction costs amounted to £8,850, the passenger vehicles totalling £300. A solitary locomotive supplied by Thomas Green & Son of Leeds (works no 169) of 1892 accounted for another £825. The Celbridge portion was never built. The steam service between Lucan and Leixlip closed down at the end of October 1897. After it went into liquidation, its assets were sold at auction on 1 August 1899, including around 6160 yards of rails, two bogie passenger carriages, two other passenger carriages, two goods wagons, a locomotive engine, a water ram in the River Liffey and much other materialDublin, The Irish Times: 1 August 1899, \\"Auctions\\", beginning \\"Sales this day. In the High Court of Justice (Ireland). Chancery Division...\\" The locomotive engine is understood to have been removed to Donegal. Dublin and Lucan Electric Railway In 1900, under a new Order in Council, the DLST was electrified and regauged from narrow gauge to gauge and renamed the Dublin and Lucan Electric Railway Company (D&LER;). A power station was built on ground at Fonthill, equipped with two 100 h.p. steam driven dynamos to produce current for the line at 500 volts. Construction of the overhead equipment was awarded to Dick, Kerr & Co., who were also to supply five double-deck, open top bogie cars. The bodies for these cars were constructed by G.F. Milnes & Co. The newly electrified line was inspected by an officer of the Board of Trade and services started on 8 March 1900. Cars ran at 45-minute intervals from 8.00 am to 10.15 pm. The cars were numbered 12 to 16 inclusive, the former steam stock in the series being re-numbered. The company title was displayed on the rocker panels in full. In 1903, car 13 was fitted with a covered top of short canopy type. However, this was removed to comply with Board of Trade regulations. Car 17 was obtained from British Thomson-Houston as a locomotive for goods haulage. This was rebuilt in 1918 and renumbered 26. In 1906 another double-deck car was obtained from Milnes Voss of Birkenhead. A new line was laid close to the original steam line, over a decade later, under an Order in Council, the Lucan and Leixlip Electric Railway Order, 1910, by a completely new company. Despite the name, this does not seem to have followed the full distance to Leixlip but rather only the to the Spa Hotel at Doddsborough. This was opened as an electric line in 1910, and was leased to the (D&LER;) in August 1911. Legally a railway, it was taken over and supported by the government during World War I under the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA). However, this ended in 1921 and facing increasing competition from the Tower Bus Co., the D&LER;'s financial position deteriorated. When the DUTC bought up the insolvent D&LER;, they also purchased the L&LER; from its shareholders, and although required to refit and reopen it in like manner, following objections from Dublin County Council the extension beyond Lucan was not reopened.Dublin, The Irish Times: 19 June 1929, page 4, \\"An Irishman's Diary\\", section \\"The Lucan Tram\\" Interconnection of the Lucan / Leixlip and city trams The Lucan tram & terminus (left) & DUTC tram & terminus (right), Phoenix Park Gate While not originally connected, the Dublin terminus of the Lucan line was 12 yards from the Park Gate terminus of the DUTC lines, on Conyngham Road, and the two were connected after the purchase by the DUTC. Closure In January 1925, after their failure to be amalgamated into the GSR under the Railways Act 1924, the line was closed, going into liquidation. Following discussions, and enabled by two acts of the Irish Free State, the D&LER; was bought up by the DUTC. The lines were regauged to Dublin's only as far as Lucan, a new line was constructed in Chapelizod, and it reopened as a DUTC route in 1928.

It is the women's section of the League of Ireland club Shelbourne FC. The senior women's team currently plays in the Women's National League. They have also fielded teams in the Dublin Women's Soccer League, the Metropolitan Girls League and the North Dublin Schoolboys/Girls League. History =1990s= In 1995 Shelbourne F.C. took over the women's football club Welsox F.C.. Welsox played in both the Civil Service League and the Dublin Women's Soccer League and had won the FAI Women's Cup in both 1992 and 1994. They were also DWSL runners-up in 1995. After coming under the Shelbourne umbrella, they also finished as FAI Women's Cup runners-up in 1997 and 1999 and were DWSL runners-up in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Future Republic of Ireland women's national football team manager Susan Ronan played for both Welsox and Shelbourne during this era. Following its integration into Shelbourne, the club was administered mainly, though not exclusively, by women on a voluntary basis while it received financial and logistical support from the men's club. However, in 2002, following a change in management and coaching staff, the original Shelbourne Ladies team disbanded and a core group of players moved to Templeogue United to merge with an existing girls' team. =Revival= After a five-year period of inactivity, Shelbourne Women's F.C. was revived in 2007 by Mick Neville, then serving as a director of coaching at Shelbourne F.C., and coach Keith O'Neill. The club initially fielded schoolgirl teams in the North Dublin Schoolboys/girls League before also joining the Metropolitan Girls League and the Dublin Women's Soccer League. =Women's National League= In 2015 Shelbourne Ladies merged with Raheny United's senior women's team. This effectively saw Shelbourne Ladies takeover Raheny United's place in the Women's National League. During the subsequent 2015–16 season, Shelbourne Ladies finished as runners-up in FAI Women's Cup, the WNL Shield and the Women's National League. All three competitions were won by Wexford Youths. However Shelbourne Ladies did win the WNL Cup after defeating UCD Waves 3–2 in the final at Richmond Park on 1 May 2016. In 2016 Shelbourne won the FAI Women's Cup after defeating Wexford Youths 5–0 in the final. The most notable individual performance to come out of the game was undoubtedly that of Shels' Leanne Kiernan, who scored a hat-trick and picked up the 'player of the match' award for her efforts. The team won their first league championship when they finished the shortened 2016 season in first place. They qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Women's Champions League with that title. In March 2019 Shelbourne announced a number of steps intended to boost \\"equality and parity of esteem for all of our players\\". They dropped the word Ladies from the women's team's name and moved WNL home games from the AUL Complex to the main stadium at Tolka Park. =Shelbourne Ladies U18= Shelbourne Ladies U18 won the 2015 WFAI Intermediate Cup, defeating St Catherine's 6–0 in the final. Shelbourne Ladies U18 also reached the semi- finals of the 2015 FAI Women's Cup, defeating two members of the Women's National League along the way. In the last sixteen they defeated Cork City 3–2 and in the quarter finals they won 4–0 against Castlebar Celtic. In the semi- final they lost 4–0 to the Shelbourne Ladies senior team.

Built between 1910 and 1929 by Portland General Electric (PGE), it was added to the register in 1985. In 1986, PGE gave Station L and of land to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI). The Station L turbine is a central feature of OMSI's Turbine Hall. Station L was on the east bank of the Willamette River just south of the Marquam Bridge. The parcel of land on which the six historic one- or two-story structures rested occupied of a larger property owned by PGE. All six were used to house equipment for generating electricity. Five of the listed buildings--the turbine room, the LP boiler room, the Lincoln Substation, the HP boiler room addition, and the 1929 powerhouse extension--were structurally connected. The sixth building, the Stephens Substation, was slightly northeast of the connected buildings. At the time of nomination to the National Register in 1985, the structural condition of the buildings varied from very poor to very good. Major equipment in these buildings in 1985 included an overhead crane, a turbine generator, electric switchgear, furnaces, conveyors, elevated walkways, concrete storage racks, boilers, and pipes. Taken as a whole, the group was the \\"last relatively complete major wood-fired steam-powered generating station in the Pacific Northwest\\". Interior view of Station L's turbine hall. Turbine being assembled History Station L was built on property that had belonged to James B. Stephens, a barrel maker who emigrated to the Oregon Country in 1844. After buying land along the Willamette River from John McLoughlin, Stephens built a house and a boat dock, established a river ferry, and in 1861 laid out the city of East Portland on the property. Rails for the Oregon Central Railroad were delivered by steamboat to Stephen's dock and laid through East Portland in 1869. In 1892, to provide electricity for streetcars and lighting for a growing population, three Portland-area businessmen--Parker F. Morey, Henry Failing, and Frederick Van Voorhies Holman --formed PGE. About a month after it was created, PGE acquired the Willamette Falls Electric Company, which generated hydroelectricity at Willamette Falls in Oregon City, and began buying or building thermal power stations at various locations in the vicinity of Portland. Among these stations, labeled A through M, Station L was one. It was located near the Inman-Poulson Lumber Company, which supplied wood waste to fuel the station's steam boilers and which used electricity to run its machines. This arrangement continued through 1954, when the lumber company went out of business. Although Station L's boilers were converted to burn oil or natural gas instead of wood waste, its electricity became more expensive to produce than the hydroelectricity that PGE could buy from the Bonneville Power Administration. PGE put the station on \\"cold standby\\" in 1964 and shut it completely in 1975.

Johnson Administration. The act came on the heels of major riots across cities throughout the U.S. in 1967, the assassination of Civil Rights Leader Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, and the publication of the report of the Kerner Commission, which recommended major expansions in public funding and support of urban areas. President Lyndon B. Johnson referred to the legislation as one of the most significant laws ever passed in the U.S., due to its scale and ambition. The act's declared intention was constructing or rehabilitating 26 million housing units, 6 million of these for low- and moderate-income families, over the next 10 years. The act authorized $5.3 billion in spending over its first three years, designed to fund 1.7 million units over that time. In the longer term, the act was designed to cost $50 billion over 10 years, had it ever been fully implemented. Its policies were to be implemented by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, which had been created in 1965. The legislation provided a significant expansion in funding for public programs, such as Public Housing. But it also marked a shift in Federal programs, increasingly focusing on using private developers as a strategy to encourage housing production of affordable units. Though the program's 10-year ambitions were not achieved, in some ways it set the tone for future U.S. approaches to policy because of this focus on public-private joint initiatives in achieving public ends.  The creation of Ginnie Mae and new financing programs  The Act established Ginnie Mae to expand availability of mortgage funds for moderate income families using government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The new entity was split from the former Fannie Mae, which retained other functions under that same name.Title VIII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, The new entity was under the purview of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and its Federal Housing Administration. The Act's major programs included Section 235 guarantees for lenders to offer mortgages for low- and moderate-income families with $200 down and 20% of a household's salary, and 1% mortgage interest rates. These guarantees were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. The way Section 235 was designed, however, led to problems. Borrowers were submitted to limited credit requirements, and first-time buyer education was minimally provided. The Rouse Company used Section 235 to resell hundreds of homes that had been condemned and abandoned for a cancelled highway project in Baltimore, Maryland. After poor results, the highway project was renewed. Section 235, in some cases, increased segregation; white families were encouraged to purchase in suburban, newly developed areas, whereas black families, held up by exclusionary practices, primarily purchased homes in lower-income, central-city areas. This pattern increased the wealth of many white families while leaving many black families behind. Though Section 235 provided aid to about a half a million families and cost the Federal Government $1.37 billion by 1974, the program featured very high rates of housing abandonment due to families being unable to pay the mortgage (10% of families foreclosed). The act also included the more- successful Section 236 assistance for moderate-income renters, replacing the 221(d)(3) Below-Market-Interest Rate program that had been created by the 1961 Housing Act. As with Section 235, developers would receive a subsidy to reduce their mortgage interest rate to just 1%. This program was used to support the majority of housing built by New York's prolific Empire State Development Corporation, then known as the Urban Development Corporation, and which completed roughly 30,000 housing units between 1968 and 1975.  Subsidies for low- and moderate-income housing and community redevelopment  The legislation provided hundreds of millions of dollars for the public housing, Model Cities, and Urban Renewal programs, all intended to aid low-income communities. The rent supplement program, which had been initially authorized under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 and which provided funds for private landlords to accept low-income tenants (and can be seen as the predecessor of the Section 8 program), was also expanded. The legislation encouraged new forms for public housing, discouraging the towers-in-the-park that had characterized previous designs in many large U.S. cities. One of its key sections was a promotion of higher architectural standards. The legislation specifically noted that \\"except in the case of housing predominantly for the elderly... the Secretary [of Housing and Urban Development] shall not approve high-rise elevator projects for families with children unless he makes a determination that there is no practical alternative.\\" The act successfully expanded production of housing in the U.S. during the four years that followed. Between 1969 and 1972, for example, the U.S. government funded more than 340,000 units of public housing. These were produced \\"conventionally,” meaning public financing and public operations, but also through turnkey (a private builder taking on responsibility for financing and construction), acquisition (purchase by the public of an existing building), and leasing.  Title IV New Towns  Title IV, provided funding for New Town projects. The initial funding of $500 million was reduced to $250 million. Jonathan, Minnesota, and Park Forest South, Illinois developments were the first to utilize this funding. *Jonathan, Minnesota *Park Forest South, Illinois *Flower Mound, Texas *St. Charles, Maryland (Several communities also applied as Title VII new towns with the follow-on National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970)  The program's end and legacy  In early 1973, President Richard Nixon placed a moratorium on new federal housing subsidies, making the 1968 Act's goals impossible to achieve. This moratorium was not lifted until the passage of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.

The owners were the Jones family, later Herbert, of Treowen and Llanarth Court. It is a Grade I listed building. History The original house on the site, Clytha House, was built by the Berkeley family of Spetchley Park in Worcestershire. It was subsequently purchased by William Jones the Elder, who constructed the gates and Clytha Castle. His son, William Jones the Younger, from 1862 Herbert, razed the Georgian mansion to the ground and replaced it with the Neoclassical Clytha Park. The Monmouthshire antiquarian Sir Joseph Bradney, in his multi-volume A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time, records that Jones's attempts to change his name to Herbert occasioned a long feud with his near neighbour, Lord Llanover, the Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, who sought to block the change; \\"A long and acrimonious, and at times highly humorous, correspondence ensued in the newspapers and a debate on the subject took place in the house of commons\\". Clytha Park, Monmouthshire - The Gates Beginning work on his inheritance in 1820, Jones used the Shrewsbury architect, Edward Haycock Snr. In the later 19th century, the house contained the painting, The Deluge by Francis Danby. A service wing at the rear of the house was demolished in 1957.

Overlooking the house, on a prominent hill, stands the folly of Clytha Castle, constructed by William Jones the Elder in memory of his wife. Long attributed to John Nash, recent documentary discovery has shown that it was designed by John Davenport, who also laid out the grounds, a \\"well-preserved (example of) a late eighteenth century landscape park\\". The original canal in the grounds by Davenport was extended in the early 19th century to create the present lake, the spoil from the excavations being used to create a raised platform for the new house. The park was further developed by Henry Avray Tipping in the early 20th century. On the old Abergavenny-to-Raglan road stand the entrance gates, again reputedly by John Nash, who did undertake work in South Wales. A lodge is set to one side. They are earlier than the house, of 1797. The entry in Mee's The King's England suggests that the gateway came from the ruined mansion of Perth-hir near Rockfield but this is disputed. The gates have their own Grade II* listing, while the lodge is listed Grade II. Architecture and description The architectural historian John Newman considers Clytha, \\"the finest early nineteenth century Greek Revival house in the county.\\" The building is a square in the Greek Doric style, of ashlar with sandstone dressings. It is of two storeys and has a \\"fine centr(al) sandstone Ionic tetrastyle portico\\". The interior is pure Doric, with a circular vestibule leading to a spacious, top-lit, staircase hall. Peter Smith, in his 1975 (2nd edition 1988) study, Houses of the Welsh Countryside, describes Clytha as \\"represent(ing) the best of the Greek revival\\".

It is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Description This painting was in the collections of since 1569; passed on to the imperial collection, it became part of those of the Kunsthistorisches Museum at its inauguration.For a short time it also became part of Napoleon's war booty. Painted the year before the artist's death, this painting, like other late works such as The Land of Cockaigne, The Peasant Dance, and The Peasant Wedding, is dominated by monumental figures. Immediately after his return from Italy, Bruegel showed no apparent interest in Italian figure types and compositions, reverting to the Antwerp tradition in which he had been trained.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, Skira, Milano 2003. However, in these late works he shows that his study of Italian painting had taken root: these figures demonstrate his knowledge of Italian art and in particular the art of Michelangelo.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, ibid. St John the Baptist, by Leonardo da Vinci, 1513–16. Detail of the Nest Robber This unusual subject apparently illustrates a Netherlandish proverb: > Dije den nest Weet dijen weeten, dijen Roft dij heeten > He who knows where the nest is, has the knowledge, he who robs, has the > nest.Cf. R. Rucker, \\"Notes for Ortelius and Bruegel\\" (2011), p.55 The painting presents a moralising contrast between the active, wicked individual and the passive man who is virtuous in spite of adversityAnother interpretation could be that \\"the pushy guy gets the girl\\", as according to some \\"nest\\" in Flemish may mean \\"pussy\\". Cf. R. Rucker, \\"Notes for Ortelius and Bruegel\\" , ibid. (a similar theme appears in his drawing The Beekeepers)Currently at the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin. And lastly it could be suggested that the pointing man is making judgement on the robber whilst not aware that he is nearly stepping into the water in front of him. It has been suggested that, with his knowledge of Italian art, Bruegel intended the peasant's gesture as a profane parody of the gesture of Leonardo's St John see image at left.F.

The town is located along the eastern shore of the Trondheimsfjorden, at the mouth of the river Levangselva. The town is located about half-way between the towns of Steinkjer and Stjørdalshalsen. Prior to 1962, the town of Levanger and its immediate vicinity was its own municipality. The town houses a campus of the Nord University. The town has a population (2018) of 10,189 and a population density of . History The kjøpstad of Levanger was founded by Carl III, king of Sweden, on 18 May 1836, on the site where the village of Levanger already existed. The village had expanded from the traditional winter fair, known as the marsimartnan (lit. the St. Marcus Market of Levanger), dating back to the 13th century. In October 1836, as the town's borders set, Commissioner Mons Lie proposed that \\"the town shall bear the name of Carlslevanger, so the name of this ancient soil can be united with that of the new town's glorious founder\\". Despite the suggestion getting refused, the town protocols spoke of Carlslevanger Stad instead of Kjøpstaden Levanger until 1838. In 1838, the formannskapsdistrikt law classified this town as a ladested or port town. The inhabitants of Levanger were not prepared at becoming a town, and so it took a long time before the town was constituted. In these early days the town was ruled by the Foged (Royal rural administrator). At that time there were already established a trade organization, \\"Levangerpatrisiatet\\" from 1695, based on the market. But only citizens of Trondheim could be members, until Levanger became a town in its own right. In 1839, the first guild of the town was established, and in the following years several new trades and craftsmen settled in the town. In 1841, the first official elections were held, and Hans Nicolai Grønn was elected the first mayor of the town. Two years later, the town got its first water pipe system, its first two primitive street lamps and a town hall. The fire-security report of 1844 clearly confirmed the great risk of disastrous fire in the town's narrow lanes; all houses were wooden houses. Therefore, the mayor hired major Johannes Sejersted to make a general report and draw up a new regulation plan, showing Levanger as a more \\"continental\\" town. Unfortunately, in 1846 (only two years later), the town was nearly totally ruined by a great fire. Maj. Sejersted's regulation plan was used when the town was rebuilt. Levanger has been damaged by two great fires since that time: in 1877 and 1897. Each time, however, the town was rebuilt as a wooden town, and still today most houses are wooden houses. In 1856, the town was separated from the rural areas surrounding it. This left the town as a very small municipality with 1,017 residents and the surrounding areas (population: 2,290) became the municipality of Levanger landsogn. Throughout the 19th century, the famous market's economical importance faded out, and the ancient arrangement was reduced to a tradition without much content. That was the end of Levanger as an important port of foreign trade between Sweden and Norway. However, in the early 20th century, the town of Levanger was pleased by new establishments such as a county hospital and college of education. The German occupation in 1940 was the beginning of a 40-year-long \\"interregnum\\" of the traditional \\"Marsimartnan\\". During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. In 1961, the town of Levanger decided to merge with several neighboring municipalities. On 1 January 1962, the municipalities of Frol (population: 3,774), Skogn (population: 4,756), and Åsen (population: 1,939) were merged with the town of Levanger (population: 1,669) to become a new municipality called Levanger. Upon the merger, however, Levanger lost its \\"town status\\". The neighboring municipality of Ytterøy was merged with Levanger two years later. In 1989, the \\"Marsimartnan\\" fair was brought back. As a result of this and some changes to Norwegian law, the municipal council voted in 1997 to re-establish the town status of what used to be the town of Levanger. The town is now the administrative centre of the municipality of Levanger. The town is laid out according to an urban and regulated plot with proper streets such as Kirkegata, the main road in the town. It's more than just a townhall and a city square. In fact, Levanger's always been a town, though not always officially, and every inhabitant in the town area carry this piece of knowledge with pride. Thus there does exist a sense of distinction between town people, and the people from the surrounding countryside. In 2002, Levanger joined the Cittaslow movement, although there have been some violations of the Cittaslow charter, of which can be mentioned the construction of the unharmonic new mini mall in Sjøgata, down by the seaside. This mini mall includes the post office, a grocery store, and an electrical appliances store. Subsequent to a merger of several institutions of higher education, including the former Høgskolen i Nord-Trøndelag, Levanger houses a campus of the Nord University as of 2016. Name The town is named after the old Levanger farm (), since the first Levanger Church was built there. The first element is \\"Lif\\" old Norse for \\"lun\\" (sheltered) and the last element is angr which means \\"fjord\\". Coat of arms The coat of arms was granted on 25 November 1960 as the arms of the town of Levanger. The arms show a gold-colored horse on a red background. The horse is a symbol for the town as a major trading center between Sweden and Norway for many centuries. The arms did not change after the addition of the other municipalities (they had no arms when they were merged with Levanger).

Should war break out, a three-pronged attack would occur from the west, the center and the east into Canada. William Hull, the governor of the Michigan territory, who had traveled to Washington, D.C. in late 1811 for consultations, was appointed brigadier-general (in addition to his duties as territorial governor) and assigned the responsibilities of leading the North West Army to reinforce Detroit, protect Michigan, and coordinate with other expeditions. Hull's army gathered in April and May 1812, before the United States declared war on Great Britain. It was to consist of the Fourth Regiment, a regular U.S. Army unit based in Vincennes, Indiana, and three regiments of Ohio militia. These were the First Regiment of Ohio Volunteers, under Col. Duncan McArthur; the Second Regiment of Ohio Volunteers, under Col. James Findlay; and the Third Regiment, under Col. Lewis Cass. The Ohio volunteer units gathered around the small community of Dayton, with Col. McArthur's First Regiment south of Dayton (near the confluence of the Great Miami and Hole's Creek) and the other two regiments slightly north of town along the Mad River. On May 25, 1812, the regiments gathered together and Governor Return J. Meigs, Jr. handed over command to Brigadier General Hull.Alec R. Gilpin, The War of 1812 in the Old Northwest (Michigan State University Press, 1958, 2012), chapters II and III. Ohio militia participating in the war were killed at two early battles of the war, the Battle of Brownstown (August 5, 1812), and Monguagon (August 9, 1812). =1813= In February, construction on Fort Meigs, next to the Maumee River in Perrysburg, Ohio, began. Gen. William Henry Harrison provided these orders. The fort would undergo two sieges. The first was in May. The British assaulted the fort, however, the Americans held the fort. The second siege was in July. Tecumseh, leading the Native American allies to the British, tried to ambush the Americans. However this did not work, and the British and Natives were forced to leave, letting the Americans win again. In September, the Battle of Lake Erie took place, with the Americans led by Oliver Hazard Perry. The British overpowered the Americans in strength and number of guns, but Perry forced the British to surrender by getting closer, as their guns were more powerful up close. =1814= Lasting Implications of the War on Ohio Key Figures =United States= *Brigadier General William Hull *Col.

Background Equality Alabama was formed by the 2002 merger of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Alabama and Equality Begins at Home of Central Alabama. The organization began to increase its activity prior to the 2005 referendum that banned same-sex marriage in the state. Representatives for the organization have stated that the additional visibility was in reaction to increasingly anti-gay legislation being brought forth in the state government. Proposed, but thus far not enacted, state legislation has included banning the adoption of children by LGBT people and prohibiting libraries from purchasing literature that portrays homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, Ken Baker of Equality Alabama told The New York Times: \\"Some people in our organization are very concerned about a backlash. We'll deal with it if it happens.\\"New York Times: Sarah Kershaw, \\"Adversaries on Gay Rights Vow State-by-State Fight,\\" July 6, 2003, accessed February 5, 2012: \\"Alabama is considered by gay rights activists to be one of the most resistant states to gay rights.\\" In 2014, Equality Alabama received public criticism for lacking diversity in its leadership and programs — particularly women, racial minorities, and transgender people. A former board member described a situation that arose after discussions about diversity that \\"turned sour.\\" In the op-ed in The Birmingham News, Michael Hansen wrote, \\"The conversation ended with a white man explicating that he was perfectly capable of doing the work on behalf of minorities, women and transgender people.\\" Opposition to Sanctity of Marriage Amendment In 2005, when the state legislature voted to hold a public referendum on the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment, Equality Alabama's chair Howard Bayless said the legislators were \\"meddling into the lives of families. The government is deciding what our families are and what families are made of, and to me that's unconscionable.\\" Before the referendum, Equality Alabama opened offices in Montgomery and Birmingham and sponsored programs to increase LGBT visibility and attempt to sway voters. The amendment passed, however, by an 81% margin in favor of forbidding recognition of same-sex marriages and civil unions.DOMAwatch.org - Alabama Alliance Defense Fund. 2006. Accessed February 4, 2011. Affiliations Equality Alabama partners with other human rights organizations. It is a member of the Alabama Safe Schools Coalition, a coalition dedicated to making Alabama schools into learning environments that are free from discrimination, harassment, and violence. Equality Alabama is also a member of the Equality Federation. =Vigil for Victims of Hate and Violence= The organization cosponsors the annual Vigil for Victims of Hate and Violence. The event is held to heighten awareness of the lack of hate crime legislation in Alabama that includes crimes based upon the perception of a person's sexual orientation or their gender. It is usually held on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol. Other cosponsors of the event include the Alabama chapter of the National Organization for Women, Alabama Safe Schools Coalition, Immanuel Presbyterian Church of Montgomery, the New Hope Metropolitan Community Church, the Montgomery chapter of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery. The event was first organized after the brutal Sylacauga murder of Billy Jack Gaither, a gay man, in 1999. Gaither had his throat cut, was bludgeoned with an axe, and then his body was burned on a pile of tires. The Billy Jack Gaither Humanitarian Award recognizes \\"an individual or organization that has shown extraordinary courage in the struggle against hatred and contributed to the creation of a just society.\\" This award is presented each year at the vigil. The 13th annual event was held on February 20, 2011. The 14th annual event was held on February 19, 2012 at the Montgomery Union Station Train Shed, rather than the usual venue of the Capitol steps, due to stormy weather. The first Stephen Light Youth Advocacy Award was awarded during the event. The award is named in honor of Stephen Light, an Alabama LGBT advocate who died in 2011 at age 25. =Road To Equality tour bus= In 2011 it partnered with the Human Rights Campaign, Auburn University at Montgomery's Gay–Straight Alliance, and PFLAG- Montgomery in sponsoring a \\"Road To Equality\\" bus tour that visited various cities around the state. It carried media presentations focusing on equal rights for LGBT people.

The structure is listed as part of the Morris Canal on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places as well as the National Register of Historic Places.http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists/morris.pdf Technical description The Pompton Dam is a spillway some wide, located along the Pompton River north of the Pequannoc Spillway and associated guard bank in Pequannock Township's Aquatic Park. The dam is a run-of-the-river spillway, which traverses the width of the river and at normal water elevation allows water to spill over its face.http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002006900 History Originally constructed in the early 19th century as a timber structure, the Pompton Dam allowed navigation upriver along the Morris Canal for nearly a century of operation. The Pompton Dam along with the Pequannoc Spillway were part of a feeder system that helped to maintain water levels along portions of the Pompton River and Ramapo River which were at the time of their construction a part of the Morris Canal. In the 1920s, C.C. Vermeule, Decommissioning Engineer for the Morris Canal, working beneath the auspices of Dr. Henry B. Kümmel, General Manager of the Morris Canal and former New Jersey State Geologist, argued against the removal the dam on the basis that doing so would reduce the surrounding lands to a series of \\"ill smelling mud flats,\\" thus devaluing the land. Instead, the State of New Jersey, which at this time owned the Morris Canal, opted to upgrade the dam to a concrete structure providing the same operation as it had previously performed.http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002006900 As of 2011, the Pompton Dam is silted on the backside such that the backwater it creates is no longer navigable by boats larger than a row-boat and the spillway no longer operates as designed. Controversy Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, representatives of a regional environmentalist faction, have demanded the removal of the Pompton Dam, based upon their unsubstantiated claim that removing the dam would improve flooding conditions in Pompton Lakes and Riverdale upstream. Critics of these claims include representatives of townships downstream of the dam who believe that flooding to their communities would be increased with an increase in water flow and velocity with the removal of the dam, as well as historic preservationists who do not believe that the dam should be removed as it is a protected part of the Morris Canal listed in both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.http://www.northjersey.com/news/101358359_History_blocks_possible_fix_for_flooding.html?page=all On March 11, 2012, a letter to the editor appeared in the Suburban Trends newspaper in support of restoring the Pompton Dam and Pequannoc Spillway to their 1920's new condition, providing evidence that this could help alleviate flooding conditions in the region.http://www.northjersey.com/news/opinions/142283145_Power_of_the_people_to_bring_flood_relief.html On March 29, 2012, an article was published in the Suburban Trends newspaper describing concerns raised by Pequannock Township elected officials over the scheduled removal of the structure, based upon evidence presented at the March township council meeting by local resident Christopher Lotito, regarding inconsistencies in the state's planning process for the project.http://www.northjersey.com/news/144780705_Town_concerned_about_removal__of_Pompton_River_s_feeder_dams_.html?page=all On April 1, 2012, a letter to the editor appeared in the Suburban Trends newspaper disputing calls for the restoration of the dam structure under claims of drownings which may have occurred at the site as well as calling the credentials of a previously cited expert into question. This letter advocated the removal of the dam structure as a solution to flooding in the Passaic River Basin.

It uses the Pentax K mount. The camera was listed as discontinued in February 2013, but the following July was reintroduced to the Japanese market in a new white and blue colour variant. Lens compatibility The Pentax K-01 is the first interchangeable single-lens mirrorless camera which is compatible with lenses from a typical SLR camera without the use of an adapter. This differs from cameras from other manufacturers such as Nikon's Nikon 1 or Pentax's own Pentax Q, where the manufacturers designed a new lens mount specifically for the new camera system. The camera is compatible with all K mount lenses; K mount lenses started being made in 1975. Lenses without the \\"A\\" aperture setting will only meter properly using stop-down metering. Manual focus lenses will continue to function as manual-focus only. Image quality The K-01 features the same sensor as the Pentax K-5 and Nikon D7000 DSLRs, a Sony 16 MP sensor. DxOMark has rated the potential image quality of the K-01 as slightly lower than the K-5 and D7000. However, compared to other MILCs, the Pentax K-01 is rated slightly better than the Sony NEX-5N, and slightly below the Sony NEX-7. DxOMark's Sport (low light ISO) rating placed the K-01 first among all MILCs at the time it was tested. Design The camera body was designed by Marc Newson. Awards The K-01 was selected as a Product Design winner at the 2012 red dot design awards, and for a Gold award at the German Design Award 2013. Variants The Pentax K-01 was released in four body colour combinations: black body with silver top and black grips, black body with silver top and yellow grips, silver body with black top (Europe only) and white body with black top and black grips. A blue and white version was released in July 2013. 200px 200px 200px Reception Almost immediately upon its release, the K-01 became one of the most controversial Pentax offerings, with criticism focusing on the Marc Newson design, which many considered made the camera too heavy and uncomfortable to hold, with poorly- placed controls, while acknowledging its strong image quality and low-light / high ISO performance. Other reviewers complained about slow autofocusing. Positive aspects of the K-01 included its image and build quality and its compatibility with all existing Pentax K-mount lenses.https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/10/3141812/pentax-k-01-review#comments References External links K-01 Category:Mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras Category:Cameras introduced in 2012 Category:Live-preview digital cameras ","title":"Pentax K-01"},{"id":"34602314","text":"Findlay Farm is a historic home and farm complex located at Peters Township in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.

Description The broadly conic shell has a milk-white color, with a narrow pale yellow band at the periphery. The shell grows to a length of 5.1 mm. It is deeply, broadly umbilicated. There are least 2½ whorls in the protoconch. They form a depressed helicoid spire, whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is about one-half immersed. The six whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, faintly roundly shouldered at the summit. The sutures are well impressed. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are somewhat inflated, and well rounded. The entire surface of the spire and the base are marked by exceedingly fine lines of growth, and microscopic closely spaced spiral striations. The aperture is rather large. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thick within, where it is reinforced by six short spiral lirations, three of which fall anterior and three posterior to the periphery. The columella is straight and slender. It is provided with three folds, the posterior of one of which is strongly lamellar and at some little distance anterior to the insertion; the other two are less strongly developed and much more oblique.

It revolves around a supernatural force on a plane. The film was released in the United States on April 12, 2016, by CBS Films and Lionsgate. Plot Vista Pacific Airlines flight 7500, a Boeing 747-300, departs from Los Angeles to Tokyo. Passengers onboard include a group of two vacationing couples, Lyn (Aja Evans) and Jack (Ben Sharples) and Brad (Ryan Kwanten) and Pia (Amy Smart), who have secretly broken up; a thief named Jake (Alex Frost); a suspicious businessman traveling with a strange wooden box, Lance (Rick Kelly); a young woman named Raquel (Christian Serratos); newlyweds Rick (Jerry Ferrara) and the snobby Liz (Nicky Whelan); and the goth Jacinta (Scout Taylor-Compton). Air hostesses Laura (Leslie Bibb) and Suzy (Jamie Chung) welcome the passengers on board, and Suzy questions Laura about her secret relationship with the married captain, Pete (Johnathon Schaech). A few hours into the flight, the plane hits turbulence that soon passes. Lance has a panic attack and begins to bleed profusely from his mouth. When Lance suddenly dies, Captain Pete continues to Japan, moving the first-class passengers into Economy class and keeping Lance's body in the closed-off first class. Laura notices plastic water bottles collapsing and quickly warns everyone to fasten their seatbelts, just as the cabin pressure drops. As the oxygen masks are dispensed above the seats, a thick smoke fills the cabin. After the cabin pressure returns to normal and the smoke disappears, Laura finds Raquel unconscious in the toilet and revives her with an oxygen tank. Meanwhile, the plane's radio has stopped working and Captain Pete cannot contact Tokyo air traffic controllers. Jake goes to first-class to steal from Lance's body when the body suddenly moves. Suzy notices that Jake, and Lance's body, have both disappeared. When Laura notices an F-16 fighter jet flying beside their plane and calls the cockpit to inform Pete, he replies that no fighter jets are present. Brad's in-flight TV show (The Twilight Zone episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\") distorts and shows an image of Lance, while Liz is startled by a reflection of Lance on her laptop screen. Raquel returns to the washroom to do a pregnancy test and is relieved to find it negative. However, smoke begins to fill the toilet and a hand grabs her and pulls her into the floor. The images of Lance appearing on their screens lead the group to search his belongings. Inside his carry-on are multiple tubes of hair with women's names taped onto them. They open Lance's small wooden box and find a \\"death doll,\\" which Jacinta explains is a shinigami — a being who collects peoples, souls, after they die, but only if they let go of whatever is holding them to this world. Subsequently, Suzy informs Laura that Lance's death has made her realize she does not want to marry her fiancé, which in turn leads to Laura breaking up with Pete. Laura searches Lance's checked luggage, entering the hold through a small hatch. A hand emerges and drags Laura away. As Suzy waits for Laura by the hatch, another hand grabs at her. Suzy runs into first class, while a cloud of smoke follows her. The smoke quickly clears and Brad, Pia, Rick, Liz, and Jacinta rush to find out what is wrong. As Suzy walks towards them, one of the overhead compartments opens and she disappears into it. While the others rush towards the cockpit, Jacinta accepts that her only option is death, and she willingly walks towards an unknown figure which appears before her. The others discover that Captain Pete, Lyn, and Jack are dead. The television in the cabin suddenly switches on, showing a breaking news story that Flight 7500 suffered a catastrophic decompression, communication had been lost, and a fighter jet has confirmed the death of everyone on board. Each of the group finds their own deceased body and remember their last moments while it is revealed that everyone that has disappeared was taken after they let go of the one thing that had been tying them to the world. Brad and Pia accept their death and reconcile as the plane runs out of fuel and crashes into the ocean. Sometime after, Liz awakens to find the plane empty. She hears a strange noise coming from one of the waste bins, a discolored hand appears, and Liz ducks out of frame.

The inhabitants of the eastern part of the Indian Territory, the Five Civilized Tribes, were suzerain nations with established tribal governments, well established cultures, and legal systems that allowed for slavery. Before European Contact these tribes were generally matriarchial societies, with agriculture being the primary economic pursuit. The bulk of the tribes lived in towns (some covering hundreds of acres and containing thousands of people) with planned streets, residential and public areas. The people were ruled by complex hereditary chiefdoms of varying size and complexity with high levels of military organization. By the middle of the 19th century, the United States Government had started leasing land from the Five Civilized Tribes (ex. Choctaw and Chickasaw ) in the western, more arid, part of Indian Territory. These leased lands were used to resettle several Plains Indian tribes that tended to be nomadic in nature, embracing the Horse culture. At the extreme, the Comanche society was based on patrilinear and patrilocal extended family sharing a common language; they did not develop the political idea of forming a nation or tribe until their relocation to Indian Territory. At the beginning of the Civil War, the Union Army was withdrawn from Indian Territory exposing the Five Civilized Tribes to aggression from the Plains Indians. The Confederacy filled the vacuum. All of the Five Civilized Tribes as well as other surrounding tribes signed treaties with the Confederacy. As a part of reconstruction, the Southern Treaty Commission was created by Congress to write new treaties with the Tribes that sided with the Confederacy. Civil War The Choctaw Nation and Chickasaw Nation in Indian Territory strongly support the Confederacy which signed the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws. The Cherokee Nation, Muscogee (Creek) Nation and Seminole Nation had troops fighting on both sides. Other tribes such as Osage, Seneca, Seneca and Shawnee of the Neosho Agency, and Quapaw Tribes also signed treaties with the Confederacy. During the Civil War, the Union Congress passed a statute that gave the President the authority to suspend the appropriations of any tribe if the tribe is \\"in a state of actual hostility to the government of the United States… and, by proclamation, to declare all treaties with such tribe to be abrogated by such tribe\\"(25 U.S.C. Sec. 72). Reconstruction Era The term Reconstruction Era typically covers the transformation of the Southern United States in the decade after the Civil War. However, the reconstruction of the Indian Territory lasted significantly longer and fostered policy changes that impacted other tribes in the rest of the country. =Southern Treaty Commission= As a component of Reconstruction, a \\"grand council was called by the President of the United States, through the department of the Interior, to which a summons was issued to each of the five tribes to send representatives. This call was mandatory as far as it related to all Indian tribes which had been identified by treaty or otherwise with the late southern confederacy. Word was also given to other tribes, many of whom had reservations in Kansas.\\" The Council, the Southern Treaty Commission, held in Ft. Smith, Arkansas, was attended by hundreds of Indians representing dozens of tribes. Over the next several years the commission negotiated treaties with different tribes that resulted in additional relocations to Indian Territory and the de facto creation (initially by treaty) of an unorganized Oklahoma Territory.With the passage of the Oklahoma organic act in 1890, Oklahoma Territory became an \\"organized\\" incorporated territory of the United States In September 1865, the Southern Treaty Commission, headed by Dennis N. Cooley, Commissioner of Indian Affairs met with delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes as well as other tribes. At the meeting Cooley informed the Tribes that by joining the Confederacy, their previous treaties were null and void, and that new treaties would need to be negotiated. Key components of new treaties would be the abolishment of slavery, providing homes for the freedmen, and giving up part of their lands for the settlement of other American Indians.Reconstruction Treaties, ibid It was stated that it was the policy of the US Government that \\"all nations and tribes in the Indian Territory be formed into one consolidated government after the plan proposed by the Senate of the United States, in a bill for organizing the Indian territory.\\"Treaty Commission Journal, p4 One result of the meeting was an \\"agreement\\" (not an officially ratified treaty) that served as a basis for the treaties that were signed the following year. In the agreement, the tribes agreed to \\"in all things recognize the government of the United States as exercising exclusive jurisdiction over them, and will not enter into any allegiance or conventional arrangement with any state, nation, power or sovereign whatsoever; that any treaty of alliance for cession of land, or any act heretofore done by them, or any of their people, by which they renounce their allegiance to the United States, is hereby revoked, cancelled, and repudiated\\" The council adjourned, and was called back to order the middle of 1866. =Committee on Territories= The United States House Committee on Territories was initially formed in 1825. Shortly after the Civil War, the Committee began discussing how best to assimilate the Five Civilized Tribes into the Union. Two significant decisions were made by the committee with regards to how the Union interacted with the Native Americans: # It was decided that Indian removal had limited effectiveness and that the new policy would be one of assimilation. One component of assimilation would be the distribution of property held in- common by the tribe to individual members of the tribe.Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek: Hearings on H.R. 19213 Before the H. Subcomm. on Indian Affairs, at 24 (Feb. 14, 1912) (statement of Hon. Byron P. Harrison) (\\"While the {1866 Treaty of Washington} contemplated the immediate allotment in severalty of the lands in the Choctaw-Chickasaw country, yet such allotment in severalty to anyone was never made under such treaty, and has only been consummated since the breaking up of the tribal organization and preparatory to the organization of the State of Oklahoma.\\") # In 1871, Congress decided that the United States would no longer deal with Indian tribes through a formal treaty-making process, providing that \\"[n]o Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation . . .\\".Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 544, 566 (currently codified at 25 U.S.C. § 71)Congress' plenary authority to \\"override treaty provisions and legislate for the protection of the Indians.\\" United States v.

Tribes making treaties with the Confederacy When the Union troops withdrew from Indian Territory, the Five Civilized Tribes were unprotected from attack by the Plains Indians that had been settled in the western part of the Territory. General Benjamin McCulloch and Brigadier General Albert Pike were placed in command of Indian Territory for the Confederacy, and offered protection to the tribes in the eastern part of the territory. Tribes that entered into treaties with the Confederacy were left \\"without any treaty whatever or treaty obligations for protection by the United States\\"Treaty Commission Journal p3 and include: * Five Civilized Tribes ** Creek Nation - July 10, 1861 ** Choctaw and Chickasaw - July 12, 1861 ** Seminole - August 1, 1861 ** Cherokee - October 7, 1861 * Other Tribes ** Shawnees, Delawares, Wichitas and affiliated tribes residing on \\"leased territories\\" (the western part of Choctaw and Chickasaw territories) - August 12, 1861 ** Comanches of the Prairie - August 12, 1861 ** Osage - October 21, 1861 ** Quapaw - October 4, 1861 ** Senecas as well as Senecas and Shawnee of the Neosho Agency - October 4, 1861 Southern Treaty Commission Delegations =Federal= Brigader General Bussey was in command of the Post at Ft.

After the war, McIntosh represented the Creek Nation as a delegate signing the Creek Treaty of 1866. He served frequently as a tribal delegate to Washington, D.C. He became a successful farmer, stockman and landholder. During his lifetime, he had held every office except Principal Chief of the Creek Nation. *Seminole ** Northern: John Chupco ** Southern: John Brown Treaties of Washington Many of the Reconstruction Treaties were titled with the phrase \\"Treaty of Washington.\\" These treaties replaced the treaties that were voided when the tribes signed treaties with the Confederacy. Some Indian tribes signed treaties at the Ft. Smith conference. The Five Civilized Tribes agreed to draft treaties, but final treaties were signed in Washington, D.C. during the year of 1866. * Five Civilized Tribes ** The Chickasaw and Choctaw signed the Chickasaw and Choctaw Treaty of Washington July 10, 1866 ** Creek August 11, 1866 ** Cherokee Reconstruction Treaty of 1866 (August 11) ** Seminole treaty ratified on August 16, 1866 * Tribes occupying Leased Land of Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes ** Shawnees October 14, 1868 ** Delawares August 10, 1866 * Other Tribes ** Osage Jan 21 1867 ** Sac and Fox 1867 All the treaties contained:Reconstruction Treaties, idib * amnesty for all crimes committed against the United States prior to the treaties * included specific provisions of peace and friendship toward the United States * notice that previous treaties were null and void * the Tribes acknowledgement of the supremacy of the United States Government, its Constitution, and its laws: past, present and future * clause stating that no federal legislation could interfere with their tribal organization * tribes would provide Land grants in their various domains for rights-of-way for railroad (and sometimes telegraph) construction through Indian Territory =Freedman Tribal Rights= Different tribes addressed freedman tribal rights (resulting from the abolition of slavery) in different ways. The Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole treaties gave the freedmen unqualified rights, while the Choctaw and Chickasaw treaty gave them the choice of being adopted into their nations or being removed by the federal government and settled elsewhere. The Chickasaw however refused to accept the Freedmen into the Chickasaw Nation on the grounds that the Nation was so small that absorbing their Freedmen would dilute the Chickasaw Nation. This refusal resulted in the Chickasaw Freedmen spending a significant number of years being citizens of no country at all. =Intertribal Council= The Intertribal Council evolved into the Territorial Legislature for the Indian Territory described in the Oklahoma organic act which established Oklahoma and Indian Territories. Each tribe would have one representative, with an additional representative for each one thousand tribal members. The superintendent of Indian affairs would serve as the council's chief executive. Land Concessions =Choctaw and Chickasaw= The Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations had a single Reconstruction Treaty, the Choctaw and Chickasaw Treaty of Washington (1866). in which they sold land west of the 98 longitude to the United States for $300,000. Much of this land was previously \\"leased\\" to the Federal Government and was the home of other Indian tribes. =Cherokee= Cherokee gave up their \\"Neutral Lands\\" in southeastern Kansas and the Cherokee Strip, to be sold to the highest bidder for not less than $1.25 an acre. They also agreed sell land to the Osage Nation and to allow the federal government to settle other tribes in the Cherokee Outlet in exchange for payment made by the government to the Cherokee Nation. =Muskogee (Creek)= The Creek ceded the western half of their lands to the Federal Government for $975,168, about $0.30 per acre =Seminole= The Seminole sold all of their land in the western part of the territory for $0.15 per acre to the Federal Government. The Seminole then purchased from the Federal Government about two hundred thousand acres of land (the current Seminole County, Oklahoma) for $0.50 per acre (former Creek land). =Osage= The Osage Nation originated in the Ohio River valley in present-day Kentucky. After years of war with invading Iroquois, they become the dominant power in an area between the Missouri and Red rivers. The Reconstruction era treaties provided an excuse for the Osage to be moved to an area in Oklahoma Territory. With the 1865 Treaty with the Osage the tribe sells significant territory in Kansas and Missouri to the US for $1.25 per acre. The Drum Creek Treaty of 1870 provided that the remainder of Osage land in Kansas be sold and the proceeds used to relocate the tribe to the Cherokee Outlet. That Osage purchased the land from the Cherokees, receiving Fee simple title, provided the tribe with a legitimately that later allowed them more autonomy when the State of Oklahoma was formed. The land purchased is now the present Osage County, Oklahoma. =Tribes of the Quapaw Indian Agency= The tribes of the Quapaw Indian Agency are the Eastern Shawnee, Miami, Modoc, Ottawa, Peoria of the Illinois Confederation, Quapaw Tribe, Seneca and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy, and Wyandotte, and some small remnants of other tribes. The tribes were originally removed from California, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and New York to Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas Territory in the 1820s and 1830s. The post-Civil War Treaties negotiated by the Southern Treaty Commission with the various tribes relocated these tribes to an area northeast of the Cherokee nation, chiefly in what is today Ottawa and Delaware Counties in Oklahoma. Many of the tribal governments are located in Miami, Oklahoma.

The seat of the Viceroyalty was located in Novgorod. The viceroyalty was established by a decree (ukase) of Catherine II on , 1776. It was subdivided into two oblasts: Novgorod and Olonets Oblast. The predecessor of Novgorod Viceroyalty was Novgorod Governorate with the seat in Novgorod. Tver Province which belonged to Novgorod Governorate, was transformed into Tver Viceroyalty, and the rest of the governorate became Novgorod Viceroyalty. Novgorod Oblast included ten uyezds, and, in particular, Kresttsy and Kirillov were chartered to become uyezd towns. Olonets Oblast included five uyezds, and Petrozavodsk was chartered in 1777. As with most of other governorates and viceroyalties established in the 1770s–1780s, the establishment of Vologda Viceroyalty was a part of the reform attempting to have a tighter control of local matters by the Russian autocracy. The reform, in turn, was facilitated by the Pugachev's Rebellion of 1774–1775. The geographical location of the viceroyalty, which was elongated from south to north, was inconvenient and lead to exchange of lands with neighboring viceroyalties. During this period, Novgorod Viceroyalty bordered with Vologda Viceroyalty in the northeast, Yaroslavl Governorate and Tver Viceroyalty in the south, Pskov Governorate in the west, Saint Petersburg Governorate and Sweden in the northwest. In terms of the modern political division of Russia, Novgorod Viceroyalty in this period comprised the areas of what is currently Novgorod Oblast, Murmansk Oblast, the greater part of the Republic of Karelia, as well as parts of Vologda and Leningrad Oblasts and minor areas of Tver Oblast. On December 11, 1781 Olonets Oblast and Novoladozhsky Uyezd of Novgorod Oblast were transferred from Novgorod Viceroyalty to Saint Petersburg Governorate. After 1781, the viceroyalty consisted of ten uyezds, *Novgorodsky Uyezd (with the administrative center located in Novgorod); *Belozersky Uyezd (Belozersk); *Borovitsky Uyezd (Borovichi); *Cherepovetsky Uyezd (Cherepovets); *Kirillovsky Uyezd (Kirillov); *Krestetsky Uyezd (Kresttsy); *Starorussky Uyezd (Staraya Russa); *Tikhvinsky Uyezd (Tikhvin); *Ustyuzhno-Zheleznopolsky Uyezd (Ustyuzhna); *Valdaysky Uyezd (Valday). In 1796, Olonets Viceroyalty was abolished and divided between Novgorod and Arkhangelsk Viceroyalties. After this event, Novgorod Viceroyalty was mentioned in official documents only as Novgorod Governorate. Governors The administration of the viceroyalty was performed by a namestnik (vice-roy) and controlled by a governor general. The governors of Novgorod Viceroyalty were * 1778-1781 Yakov Yefimovich Sivers (Jacob Sievers); * 1783-1784 Yakov Ivanovich Bryus; * 1785-1795 Nikolay Petrovich Arkharov. The namestniks were * 1778 Frants Nikolayevich Klichka; * 1781-1782 Pyotr Stepanovich Protasov; * 1783-1784 Alexander Yakovlevich Protasov; * 1785 Pyotr Petrovich Konovnitsyn; * 1786-1793 Pyotr Fyodorovich Kvashnin-Samarin; * 1794-1796 Pyotr Petrovich Mitusov.

Like John Simpson Kirkpatrick, he used a donkey to carry wounded soldiers from the battlefield. He was later honoured with a Military Medal for repeatedly rescuing wounded from the battlefield while under heavy fire at the Battle of the Somme. Early life Henderson was born on 26 August 1895 at Waihi in the North Island of New Zealand. He was a trainee teacher in Auckland until the outbreak of the First World War. On 10 August 1914, he enlisted with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) as a stretcher-bearer in the New Zealand Medical Corps. First World War Henderson embarked for the Middle East with the main body of the NZEF in October 1914. Soon after the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli he saw John Simpson Kirkpatrick using a donkey to carry wounded soldiers, and began to do the same. While it is reported that he began this work after Kirkpatrick's death on 19 May 1915, he was photographed with a donkey carrying a wounded man on 12 May 1915 by Sergeant James Gardiner Jackson. According to Henderson's own account, he continued the work for about six weeks after Kirkpatrick's death. Henderson later served in France, and on 22 October 1916 was awarded the recently created Military Medal for bravery in battle on land, with the citation \\"During operations on the Somme on 15th September he went out repeatedly under heavy shellfire and brought in wounded who were exposed to it. He set a fine example to other bearers\\". Henderson was promoted to lance corporal and then, on 23 March 1917, to corporal. After a period of service at a NZEF hospital in England, Henderson was very badly gassed at Passchendaele on 12 October 1917 and evacuated to England where he was found to be dangerously ill, was declared unfit for military service and was repatriated. He sailed from Liverpool on 2 February 1918 and was discharged from the NZEF for medical reasons on 21 May 1918. He was awarded the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Later life Henderson did not recover from the effects of the gas. He went back to teaching, but became blind in 1934 and was obliged to stop working. He remained in poor health for the rest of his life, and died in Greenlane Hospital, Auckland, on 14 November 1958. Legacy Photolithographic reproduction of a water-colour by Moore- Jones, inscribed To the memory of our hero comrade 'Murphy' (Simpson) killed May 1915. Heroes of the Red Cross. Private Simpson, D.C.M., & his donkey at Anzac, from the version of the painting now in the Australian War Memorial Museum, printed by W.J. Bryce, London 1918. Henderson was painted in water- colour as The Man with the Donkey by Horace Moore-Jones. Moore-Jones worked from Jackson's photograph of Henderson, but believed it to be of John Simpson Kirkpatrick. At least six versions of the painting were made, and it was extensively reproduced as a portrait of Simpson; the inscriptions on some versions implied that Simpson was nicknamed \\"Murphy\\". In a newspaper interview in 1950, Henderson said that he, not Simpson, was the man in the paintings. He had \\"watched the legend grow\\" without worrying about it, but was now old and \\"want[ed] the matter cleared up\\". It was also untrue that Simpson was known as \\"Murphy\\". Murphy was the name of the donkey, which Simpson had found wandering on the beach. A bronze sculpture by Paul Walshe of Richard Alexander Henderson as \\"The Man with the Donkey\\" stands outside the National War Memorial in Wellington. It is based on Jackson's photograph, and is a \\"tribute to all medical personnel, stretcher bearers and ambulance drivers who served alongside New Zealand troops in wartime\\". Commissioned by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association, it was unveiled by Henderson's son Ross in 1990 for the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. The inscription on the plaque reads: \\"The stories of Simpson and Henderson are the stories of all stretcher-bearers ... these men exposed their lives to danger to save comrades and so built up the tradition of unselfishness and cool courage that is a feature of their service.\\" Henderson's story is told through the eyes of the donkey in The Donkey Man, a book for children by Glyn Harper, a military historian, with illustrations by Bruce Potter, which was published in 2004. The Anzac of the Year Award of the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association, first awarded in 2010, is a 70 cm bronze statue of Henderson and his donkey by Matt Gauldie.

During the following years, she became a one-time JWP Openweight Champion, a one-time JWP Junior Champion, a five- time JWP Tag Team Champion and a three-time Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Champion. Notable titles she has held outside of JWP include All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling's AJW Championship and AJW Tag Team Championship, Ice Ribbon's International Ribbon Tag Team Championship and NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling's High Speed Championship. In July 2011, Yoneyama announced that she would be ending her twelve-year career the following December. After a retirement tour, which took Yoneyama not only across the Japanese independent circuit, but also to the United States, she announced during her retirement ceremony that she had changed her mind and decided to continue her career. In January 2013, Yoneyama quit JWP to become a freelancer, working for promotions such as Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling, Oz Academy, Union Pro Wrestling and World Wonder Ring Stardom. Professional wrestling career =JWP Joshi Puroresu (1999–2013)= Yoneyama made her professional wrestling debut for the JWP Joshi Puroresu promotion on November 29, 1999, in a match against Kayoko Haruyama, during which she suffered an eye injury, which forced her to take an early break from her new career. After making her return in early 2000, Yoneyama continued wrestling for JWP, but also made appearances in promotions such as All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW), Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion, JDStar, International Wrestling Association of Japan, Ladies Legend Pro Wrestling (LLPW) and NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling. Yoneyama won her first professional wrestling championship on July 6, 2002, when she defeated Erika Watanabe for the JWP Junior Championship. On July 20, Yoneyama and Kayoko Haruyama defeated Mika Nishio and Miyuki Fujii for the AJW Tag Team Championship, which was followed by Yoneyama defeating Fujii in a singles match on November 29 to win the AJW Championship. On January 2, 2003, Yoneyama won yet another title by defeating Princesa Sandy for the BJW Women's Championship. Her AJW Championship reign ended two days later, when she was defeated by Mika Nishio, and a month later she and Haruyama were stripped of the AJW Tag Team Championship. On January 25, 2004, Yoneyama and Haruyama defeated Etsuko Mita and Misae Genki in a tournament final to win the JWP Tag Team Championship.

On August 7, Yoneyama defeated Tanny Mouse to become the 199th Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion, but immediately afterwards vacated the title and entered a battle royal to determine the 200th champion. In the match, Mouse would regain the title. After a fifteen-month reign, Yoneyama and Leon lost the JWP Tag Team Championship to Ran Yu-Yu and Toshie Uematsu on August 6, 2006. While still maintaining JWP as her home promotion, in September 2006, Yoneyama began working regularly for her friend Emi Sakura's new Ice Ribbon promotion. Yoneyama ended the year by winning the Daily Sports Christmas Cup. On February 28, 2007, Yoneyama and Toshie Uematsu won a one night tournament to become the number one contenders to the JWP Tag Team Championship. However, they would fail to capture the championship in their title match against Kazuki and Sachie Abe on March 21. In late 2007, Yoneyama began feuding with JWP Openweight Champion Azumi Hyuga, which led to a title match between the two on December 9, where Hyuga retained her title. In January 2009, Yoneyama debuted a new character, Yoneyamakao Lee, a Chinese wrestler supposedly signed to the nonexistent New Beijing Pro Wrestling (NBPW) promotion. The character mainly made appearances for DDT, the inventors of the NBPW concept. On July 19, Yoneyama and Emi Sakura defeated Command Bolshoi and Megumi Yabushita for the JWP Tag Team and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championships.

On September 19, Yoneyama defeated former partner Emi Sakura in a JWP Openweight Championship vs. Hair match; as a result, Sakura was shaved bald. On October 10, Yoneyama faced American Hailey Hatred in a match, where she put her JWP Openweight Championship and Hatred her Absolute Intense Wrestling (AIW) Women's and Totally Lethal Wrestling (TLW) World Women's Championships on the line. After the first match ended in a double knockout, Yoneyama and Hatred wrestled another match, which also ended in a double knockout, meaning that both champions kept their titles. On November 22, Yoneyama made her debut for Smash at Smash.10, where she teamed with Emi Sakura in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Kana and Syuri. After the match, Yoneyama offered to defend the JWP Openweight Championship against Syuri. On November 30, Yoneyama and Hailey Hatred, known collectively as \\"Queens Revolution\\", defeated Cherry Bomb and Sexy Star at a Joshi 4 Hope event to become the inaugural TLW World Women's Tag Team Champions. Yoneyama returned to Smash on December 11 at Smash.11, where she teamed with Command Bolshoi to defeat Syuri and Nagisa Nozaki in a tag team match. On December 24 at Happening Eve, Yoneyama defeated Syuri in the main event to retain the JWP Openweight Championship. In January 2011, Yoneyama brought back the Yoneyamakao Lee character and, under it, began making regular appearances for Ice Ribbon. The following month, Yoneyamakao formed a tag team with Hikari Minami, which eventually led to the two unsuccessfully challenging Emi Sakura and Ray for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship two months later. Back in JWP, Yoneyama and Hatred joined forces with Kyoko Kimura and Sayaka Obihiro to form a stable named Yoneyama Kakumei-gun (\\"Yoneyama Revolutionary Army\\"). On April 3, Yoneyama lost the JWP Openweight Championship to Leon in a match, which was also contested for the NEO High Speed Championship. Yoneyama's reign lasted 258 days and included record-setting ten successful title defenses, all against JWP outsiders as part of the \\"Yoneyama Revolution\\". Afterwards, Yoneyama was sidelined for two months with a mandible fracture. On July 10, Yoneyama announced after a match that she was going to retire from professional wrestling at the end of the year. The announcement led to Yoneyama unsuccessfully challenging Hailey Hatred for the JWP Openweight, TLW World Women's and IMW Hybrid Fighting Championships on August 7. Yoneyama's retirement tour saw her make appearances for promotions such as Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina, Pro Wrestling Wave, Oz Academy, Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling, and Freedoms. On November 13, Yoneyama and Hatred put their TLW World Women's Tag Team Championship on the line against JWP Tag Team and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Champions Kayoko Haruyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki. Yoneyama and Hatred went on to win the match to become Triple Crown Tag Team Champions. Yoneyama's retirement tour also led her to make her American debut, when she took part in Chikara's JoshiMania weekend as a last minute replacement for an injured Command Bolshoi. On December 2 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Yoneyama teamed with Hanako Nakamori and Tsubasa Kuragaki to defeat Archibald Peck, El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream Jr. in an intergender six-person tag team match.

On the third and final night of the tour in Manhattan, New York, Yoneyama was defeated by Mayumi Ozaki in a singles match. On December 14, Yoneyama wrestled her Ice Ribbon farewell match, where she wrestled Hiroyo Matsumoto to a ten-minute time limit draw. On December 23, Yoneyama was defeated by Kayoko Haruyama in her retirement match. However, during the post-match ceremony, Yoneyama interrupted a ten bell salute to her career and announced that she had changed her mind and did not want to retire after all. The surprise turn led to JWP offering a refund to anyone who attended the show, announcing that in the future wrestlers would have to sign contracts to make sure they do retire after their retirement matches and finally stripping Queens Revolution of all three of their tag team championships. JWP also refunded tickets for all events from Yoneyama's retirement announcement to her supposed retirement match. Yoneyama later apologized for betraying the trust of her fans and co- workers and claimed that she had come to the decision to retire after her mandible fracture, feeling that, with her recent lengthy JWP Openweight Championship reign, she had done all she could in JWP and did not want to continue risking her health. However, gradually she started to have a change of heart brought on especially by her trip to the United States. Yoneyama continued wrestling for JWP on January 9 at the promotion's first event of 2012. Yoneyama in September 2012 On April 22, Yoneyama faced Emi Sakura in a special singles match, where the loser would have to join the winner's promotion.

Yoneyama and Sakura made their second successful defense on July 15 against the team of Kazuki and Morii, after which they changed their team name from the Tai-Pan Sisters to \\"Reset\\". On August 19, Reset lost the titles to Arisa Nakajima and Command Bolshoi in their third title defense. On September 9, Yoneyama and Sakura defeated Hanako Nakamori and Morii in a tag team match, after which the two agreed to join Reset to form the \\"Heart Move Kei Reform\\" (HMK) stable.

Bonnet is an American attorney who served as interim Secretary of State of Indiana in 2012. Bonnet was the deputy Secretary when his superior Charlie White lost his position after being convicted of voter fraud, leading Governor Mitch Daniels to appoint Bonnet as White's interim successor on February 4, 2012. After a month in office, Bonnet was succeeded by Connie Lawson on March 16. Currently, Bonnet serves as the chief legal counsel in Lawson's administration. Early life and education After graduating from Yorktown High School, Bonnet earned a BA from Indiana University, Juris Doctor from the University of Tennessee, an MBA from the University of New Orleans, and a Masters in International Business and Finance from the University of Texas at Dallas.  Career  Spending eighteen years practicing commercial law in Texas and Louisiana, Bonnet settled in New Orleans in 1999 and managed a private legal practice. When Hurricane Katrina hit, Bonnet and his family evacuated to Indianapolis. Having relatives there, he intended the move to be \\"temporary\\", and became the interim chief counsel in the office of then- Secretary of State Todd Rokita on November 15, 2005. Nevertheless, the appointment became permanent. Whilst counsel, Bonnet helped implement the state's new photo ID law, as well as the Help America Vote Act. During the 2007 to 2010 primary and general election seasons, he served as the state's coordinator of polling day monitoring. In 2009, for his work in representing victims of domestic violence, he was honored by the Indiana Protective Order Pro-Bono Project. Originally the deputy Secretary of State for parts of 2008 and 2009, Secretary of State Charlie White appointed Bonnet again to be second-in-command, as well as chief of staff, on March 14, 2011. At the time, Bonnet was on the Comprehensive HIV Services Planning and Advisory Council, and the Indiana Code Revision Commission. On the eve of his ascension to the secretaryship, he was working on a doctorate in organizational leadership at Indiana Wesleyan University. =Secretary of State= On February 4, 2012, White was removed from office after being convicted of voter fraud. Governor Mitch Daniels proceeded to appoint Bonnet to the post on an interim basis, pending the chance White's conviction was downgraded to a misdemeanor, or otherwise until Daniels made a permanent appointment. After his appointment, Bonnet was identified as a Republican. Around three weeks later, White's felony conviction was upheld, though succession continued to be delayed by a legal challenge from White's Democratic opponent in the secretaryship election of 2010, arguing he should assume the office. This challenge was dismissed on March 15. With Daniels now free to choose, some speculation arose that Bonnet could carry on fully, with a commentator in The Indianapolis Star arguing he would be the least political choice and noting the governor's praise of Bonnet's performance, though others argued his lack of political experience would make him an unlikely selection, and Bonnet made no public suggestion he desired to retain the position. The following day, state senator Connie Lawson succeeded Bonnet. Upon Lawson's appointment as secretary, Bonnet's duties as deputy secretary and chief of staff were conferred to Davey Neal. He now serves as chief legal counsel within Lawson's administration.  Personal life  Bonnet is married with three children.

Originating from a disturbance within a monsoon trough in early September, Sarah was first classified as a tropical depression near the Mariana Islands on September 5\\\\. Moving quickly westward, the depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Sarah. On September 8, the storm abruptly turned southward and temporarily attained typhoon status. Following a series of interactions with secondary areas of low pressure, the storm turned northward the following day. By September 11, Sarah entered a region favoring development and underwent a period of explosive intensification. At the end of this phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The typhoon subsequently weakened rapidly and made two landfalls in Taiwan by September 12\\\\. After moving over the Taiwan Strait, Sarah made its final landfall in Eastern China on September 13 before dissipating the following day. While the typhoon meandered near the Philippines, it brought several days of heavy rain to much of Luzon, triggering extensive flash flooding. At least 44 people perished across the country and another 200,000 were left homeless. Striking Taiwan as a strong typhoon, Sarah caused widespread wind damage that left approximately 840,000 residents without power. Excessive rainfall associated with the storm triggered flooding that washed away highways and inundated about 40,500 hectares (100,000 acres) of farmland. Throughout the island, Sarah was responsible for 19 fatalities and at least $171 million USD (4.38 billion New Taiwan dollars) in damage. Four deaths also took place on the Gotō Islands. Additionally, four deaths took place offshore and another seventeen people were listed as missing. Meteorological history In early September 1989, a monsoon trough became established across the western Pacific. By September 3, a disturbance formed within the trough approximately 1,100 km (685 mi) southeast of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima. Initially, a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) to the northwest inhibited convective development; however, \\"complex interactions\\", according to Lt. Cdr. Nicholas D. Gural, later occurred between the TUTT cell, the initial disturbance, and a second disturbance, which resulted in favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. Due to the improved environment, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued two Tropical Cyclone Formation Alerts on the system on September 5. By this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. Ultimately, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 22W early on September 6, at which time the depression was situated northwest of the Mariana Islands. Initially, the depression tracked west-southwestwards and gradually intensified; however, after being upgraded to Tropical Storm Sarah late on September 6, the system turned northwestward and accelerated towards Okinawa. By September 8, Sarah decelerated as it underwent a binary interaction with a secondary area of convection to the southwest. This interaction caused the cyclone to abruptly turn southwestward towards the Philippines before nearly stalling on September 9\\\\. During this time, the storm temporarily attained typhoon status, having estimated winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Coinciding with Sarah's time as a typhoon, a new area of low pressure, classified as a \\"lee side low\\", developed along the west coast of Luzon. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Openg. Later on September 9, Sarah turned sharply northward as the lee side low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification gradually took place as the storm moved away from the Philippines, with the storm reaching typhoon status by September 10\\\\. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September 11\\\\. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140 km/h (85 mph) to 215 km/h (135 mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well- defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). The JMA assessed Sarah to have been somewhat weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg). Forecasters at the JTWC initially projected the storm to track north of Taiwan on September 12 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved south of the expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan. The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) late on September 11\\\\. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12 hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September 13\\\\. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China. Impact =Philippines= Although the storm did not make landfall in the Philippines, its close proximity brought several days of heavy rain to Luzon, leading to widespread flash floods and mudslides. Landslides across the region isolated many cities, including Baguio. (Accessed March 28, 2012 through LexisNexis) Rivers began exceeding their banks on September 10 and flooded surrounding areas. In the province of Ilocos Sur, ten people were killed in a single town after flood waters swept away many homes overnight.

(Accessed March 28, 2012 through LexisNexis) Less than a week after the storm, additional rains in areas affected by Sarah triggered landslides that killed at least 16 people. Officials blamed the landslides on rocks loosened by the typhoon's rains. =Taiwan= On September 10, meteorologists across Taiwan warned residents of torrential rain across the country, especially in mountainous areas where more than could fall. The Central Weather Bureau also advised vessels in the Bashi Channel to be cautious or rough seas associated with the typhoon. (Accessed March 28, 2012 through LexisNexis) Most flights to and from the island were canceled by September 11 for the duration of the storm; however, rail service continued for another day. Approximately 10,000 volunteer firefighters were placed on alert and city police were called in to organize evacuation centers. (Accessed March 28, 2012 through LexisNexis) Striking Taiwan as a powerful typhoon, destructive winds battered coastal areas near where the center moved ashore. According to officials in Taiwan, winds were recorded up to 174 km/h (108 mph) with gusts to 208 km/h (129 mph). (Accessed March 28, 2012 through LexisNexis) These winds downed thousands of trees and power lines, leaving an estimated 840,000 residents without electricity. A total of 272,000 telephone lines were damaged or destroyed by the storm. Excessive rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding that inundated agricultural areas and paralyzed transportation as roads and bridges were washed away. On September 11, the Suhua Highway was shut down due to landslides. In Hualien City, flood waters reached a depth of and several homes were destroyed, leaving roughly 100 people homeless. (Accessed March 28, 2012 through LexisNexis) Across the island, 28 homes were destroyed and another 41 sustained damage. At least 19 people perished in Taiwan and another 14 were reported missing.

On 30 March 1944, prior to the beginning of work on her construction, Masbate (ARG-1) was renamed Webster and reclassified ARV-2. The ship's keel was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2666) on 1 July 1944 at Baltimore, MD, by the Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard, Inc. Sponsored by Mrs. Walter W. Webster, the widow of the ship's namesake, the ship was launched on 5 August 1944 and commissioned at Baltimore on 17 March 1945, Captain Jesse G. Johnson in command. After fitting out, Webster departed Baltimore on 22 March 1945 and arrived at Norfolk Naval Base later that day. There, the aircraft repair ship loaded supplies and provisions into the second week of April, when she got underway for shakedown and training in Chesapeake Bay. After subsequent minor repairs and alterations at the Norfolk Navy Yard from 21 April to 8 May, Webster joined Convoy No. 507 on 12 May, transited the Panama Canal eight days later, and arrived at the Naval Air Station (NAS), Alameda, CA, on 6 June. After further repairs and alterations, the ship departed Alameda on 16 June, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 24th and docked at NAS Ford Island, where she stayed for four days before she shifted to the navy yard for armament alterations. Shifting subsequently to a berth alongside USS Ozark (LSV-2) on the 28th, Webster remained in Hawaiian waters through most of July. The ship got underway for the Marshall Islands on the 31st; arrived at Eniwetok Atoll on 10 August; and remained there through mid- September. During her stay at Eniwetok, the surrender of Japan brought World War II to a close. Meanwhile, the ship, herself, serviced the fleet carriers Wasp (CV-18), Antietam (CV-36), and Intrepid (CV-11); the light fleet carrier Cabot (CVL-28), and a half-dozen escort aircraft carrier's, overhauling aviation equipment and returning it to stock for reissue. The material that could not be stored on board—bulky items such as drop tanks and the like—was stored ashore in a depot on Parry Island. The end of the war had removed the necessity for the replenishment of fast carrier task forces in the fleet anchorage in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands advanced base sites, but there still remained the occupation of Japan. Webster accordingly departed Eniwetok on 13 September, bound via Guam for Tokyo Bay, where she arrived on the 26th. There, Webster serviced all naval aviation activities in the Tokyo Bay area, including the carriers Yorktown (CV-10), Shangri-La (CV-38), Bon Homme Richard (CV-31), Boxer (CV-21), Munda (CVE-104), and Hoggatt Bay (CVE-75); the aviation units of battleships New Jersey (BB-62), Tennessee (BB-43), California (BB-44); those of the heavy cruisers St. Paul (CA-73) and Quincy (CA-71); and finally the planes of 10 light cruisers. In addition, the aircraft repair ship serviced the planes from Marine Air Group 21 and assisted the board headed by Rear Admiral Frederick W. Pennoyer in its investigations into the development of Japanese aircraft and aircraft engine design in World War II. Webster remained in Tokyo Bay from 6 October to 3 November. During that time, Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague visited the ship on 20 October and conferred the Presidential Unit Citation to, among others, Capt. Johnson, the ship's commanding officer, for his service in the escort carrier Guadalcanal (CVE-60) in the Atlantic campaign. Webster, transporting men homeward-bound for discharge, made Guam on 9 November, and stayed for only one night, getting underway for the Marshall Islands on the 10th. Six days later, she reached Roi Island, Kwajalein Atoll and, on the 18th, got underway for the Hawaiian Islands. Webster disembarked her passengers upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 27 November and stood out of Hawaiian waters on the 30th, bound for Panama. She reached the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal at 0746 on 20 December, transited the canal later that day. and moored at Coco Solo at 1708. The aircraft repair ship then pushed on for Norfolk, VA, on 22 December, arrived at Norfolk seven days later, and remained in the Tidewater area through mid-January of the following year. On 25 January 1946, Webster departed Norfolk and arrived at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the following day, mooring alongside the heavy cruiser Portland (CA-33). Berthed alongside a succession of ships—Fomalhaut (AK-22), Tranquility (AH-14), Sanctuary (AH-17), Dithmarschen (IX-301), Okanogan (APA-220), and Augusta (CA-31)—Webster awaited her decommissioning. At 1047 on 28 June 1946, her commissioning pennant came down for the last time. Struck from the Navy list on I September 1962, she was simultaneously transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up. She was subsequently scrapped.

He had emigrated with his family to New Zealand in 1921, and from 1923 he accumulated a series of convictions and in 1938 was declared a \\"habitual criminal;\\".

A week after the wedding he told her parents that she had been lost at sea when their ship was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean, but they were suspicious and reported her disappearance to the police. Detective Sergeant William Fell established that \\"George Turner\\" (supposed to be wealthy and an agent of the British government who was returning to Britain) was, in fact, George Cecil Horry, and persuaded the Crown solicitor in Auckland that the case was strong enough to go to trial. He was arrested in 1951 By 1951 when he was arrested he had accumulated 64 convictions (and been conscripted into the New Zealand Army in 1944). The jury accepted the circumstantial evidence and found him guilty; though the death penalty for murder had been restored it was not in force in 1942 so he was not hanged. Although one of the officers who interviewed Horry in 1943 had retired, his written record of the interview enabled him to recall the details.

He later designed the H A Salmon residence on Claremont Street. Hooper was one of Dunedin's leading architects in the arts and crafts movement, and many of the city's stately homes were designed by him. The Waddell Smith house in Ings Avenue is regarded as Hooper's earliest bungalow, although he also designed small, single-storey houses for the Windle Settlement, a group of early state houses in the suburb of Mornington. Hooper's style was characterised by complex roof geometry, buttresses, overhanging eaves, oriel windows and leaded lights, often with stained glass. Hooper's houses revitalised domestic architecture in New Zealand prior to the First World War, and he also carried out commercial and ecclesiastical commissions.

In 1955, she was promoted to sergeant and sent to Fort Dorset in Wellington. =1955–58: New Zealand Police= In 1955, Mathieson left the army and joined the New Zealand Police, notably being the first female Māori to do so. Out-performing all of the other cadets during her training, she was promoted from a beat constable to a detective in 1958. Shortly following her marriage on 24 May, Mathieson, now Hond, retired from the police force in order to start a family. =1976–84: Tertiary and secondary teaching= Hond worked as a teacher at the Hamilton Teachers' College beginning in 1976, focusing on early childhood education. She soon went to work at Hillcrest High School in Hamilton in 1978, before shortly being appointed deputy principal of the school connected to the Department of Social Welfare Girls' Home, both teaching and counselling. =1984-89: Community worker= Moving to New Plymouth in 1984, Hond joined a prison reform committee and worked as a community officer for the Department of Māori Affairs. In 1987, she founded the Taranaki Activity Centre, an alternative education system for otherwise wayward youth. Death Due to heart problems, possibly contributed to by 40 years of smoking cigarettes, Hond died on 18 November 1989 in New Plymouth, being survived by her husband and remaining five children. She was buried in the Ruakere family cemetery in Puniho. Personal life On 24 May 1958, Mathieson married Jeffrey \\"Jeff\\" Hond, a Royal New Zealand Air Force warrant officer in Wellington. They went on to have six children: three sons and three daughters. One son died in childhood. Hond studied at the University of Waikato in 1975. Hond formed Te Reo o Taranaki, an organisation dedicated to promoting Māori culture. Under this aegis of this organisation, Hond successfully campaigned for a Māori studies department at the Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki. Aware of the effect alcohol had on her Māori culture, Hond was a non-drinker.

PII form barrel-like homotrimers with a flexible loop, namely T-loop, emerging from each subunit. PII proteins have extraordinary sensory properties; they can exist in a vast range of structural status accordingly to the levels of ATP, ADP and 2-oxogluratate. These metabolites interact allosterically with PII in three conserved binding sites located in the lateral cavity between each PII subunit. ATP and ADP bind competitively to the nucleotide binding whereas the 2-oxoglutarate only interacts with PII in the presence of MgATP. In Proteobacteria, PII proteins are also subject to a cycle of reversible posttranslational modification (Huergo et al., 2013). Under a low nitrogen regime, the low intracellular glutamine level triggers the uridylyl-transferase activity of the bi- functional GlnD enzyme promoting the uridylylation of a conserved Tyr-51 located at the top the PII T-loop. Conversely, under a high nitrogen regime, accumulation of intracellular glutamine triggers the uridylyl-removing activity of GlnD and PII accumulates in its non-modified form (Huergo et al., 2013). The ability of PII to sense important metabolites and integrate signals deriving from energy status (ATP and ADP ratio), carbon (2-oxogluratate) and nitrogen (glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate) levels were capitalized during evolution such that PII can act as a dissociable regulatory subunit of a range of transporters, transcriptional regulators and enzymes.  Structure  PII proteins exist in trimers in vivo and bind ATP in a cleft between the subunits. There are two flexible loops call the B-loop and T-loop which are involved in regulation of the protein. The T-loop contains a conserved tyrosine which is the site of uridyl attachment.E. coli. Homologs in other bacteria may have different names.  Role in nitrogen metabolism  Following nitrogen starvation, increased intra-cellular concentrations of ammonia cause the de-uridylylation of GlnK. This then binds directly to the ammonia channel AmtB to block ammonia conduction. PII proteins such as SbtB are also implicated in carbon metabolism regulation, these proteins are able to control the activity of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase in plants, algae and Bacteria  References  Category:Protein families ","title":"Pii nitrogen regulatory proteins"},{"id":"34602895","title":"Fencing at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's foil"},{"id":"34602901","text":"Joseph \\"Joe\\" Riposo is a saxophonist, composer, arranger, and was an educator at Syracuse University.

Belcher Jr. (born December 15, 1958) is a retired American basketball player who is best known for his collegiate career at St. Bonaventure University between 1977–78 and 1980–81. While playing for the Bonnies, Belcher scored 2,077 points, averaged 20 points per game for his career, and was twice named the Eastern 8 Men's Basketball Player of the Year (the Eastern 8 is now known as the Atlantic 10 Conference). Early life Born in Queens, Belcher moved upstate to Syracuse at age six when his father had to relocate while working for General Motors. He played many sports as a youth, including basketball, golf, tennis, baseball, football and hockey. As Belcher got older, he began to grow quickly. He claims to have grown from 5'6\\" to 6'1\\" in seventh grade, to 6'3\\" in eighth grade and then 6'6\\" by his senior year in high school at Christian Brothers Academy. The reason he focused on basketball, he later explained, was because \\"Basketball was a given in my neighborhood if you were that tall, so I went with the flow and played.\\" Belcher became an All-American player in high school and then decided to continue his career at St. Bonaventure University. College career Belcher's collegiate career began in 1977–78. A forward, he averaged 7.3 points and 3.9 rebounds per game during his freshman season. St. Bonaventure earned a berth into the 1978 NCAA Tournament but lost in the round of 32 to Penn. They finished their season with a 21–8 overall record. The following year, Belcher increased his averages to 21.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game while leading the team in points for the first of three consecutive seasons. Behind a 19–8 record, the Bonnies earned their way into the 1979 National Invitation Tournament. They lost in the first round to Alabama, however, thus ending their season with a 19–9 record. In 1979–80, his junior year, Belcher led the Eastern Athletic Association, popularly known as the Eastern 8, in scoring with a 26.9 points per game average. He also recorded 7.3 rebounds per game, and even though St. Bonaventure finished in sixth place in the conference with a 16–11 record, Belcher was chosen as the conference player of the year. He was also selected to the Eastern 8 All-Conference First Team. In Belcher's final season he repeated as both a First Team and conference player of the year honoree. His scoring and rebounding decreased slightly, however, to averages of 24.5 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. St. Bonaventure finished with a 14–13 overall record and in sixth place once again. During Belcher's four-year career, his teams compiled a record of 70 wins and 34 losses. He scored 2,077 points, which is second all-time in school history behind Greg Sanders' 2,238 but still ahead of Hall of Famer Bob Lanier, who sits third on the list. Later life After college, the San Antonio Spurs selected him in the fourth round (87th overall) in the 1981 NBA Draft. He was supposed to be the back-up to future Hall of Famer George Gervin in 1981–82 but he never appeared in a regular season game. When he broke all of the bones in his right ankle during a preseason exhibition game, his basketball career officially ended, with the exception of a two-game attempted comeback with the Continental Basketball Association's Wyoming Wildcatters.1983-84 CBA Official Guide, page 114 He then went home to Syracuse, New York to work for his old high school basketball coach at Niagara Mohawk Gas and Electric Company. He concurrently pursued a master's degree in business (MBA) at the State University of New York at Oswego, and in 1999 he received his degree. Belcher is an actor and musician as well and plays the saxophone. After Niagara Mohawk Gas and Electric Company downsized and he lost his job, Belcher became a professional jazz musician. He is also a proficient on piano, trumpet, drums, upright bass and guitar player and utilizes his musical ability in Albany and Schenectady, New York. Aside from performing in a jazz trio alongside his wife, Sarah, Belcher also holds a regular day job.

The present building, a \\"striking\\" architectural \\"pantomime\\" by the prolific local firm Clayton & Black, dates from the 1930s, but a pub of this name has stood on the site since 1860—making it one of the first developments beyond the boundaries of the ancient village. This 18th- century pub was, in turn, converted from a former farmhouse. Built using materials characteristic of 16th-century Vernacular architecture, the pub is in the Mock Tudor style and has a wide range of extravagant decorative features inside and outside—contrasting with the simple design of the neighbouring offices at 20–22 Marlborough Place, designed a year later. English Heritage has listed the pub at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Brighton developed into a fashionable resort in the 18th and 19th centuries, with Old Steine as one of its focal points. This was at the southern end of a large area of poorly drained, low- lying open space that later became known as Valley Gardens. The first residential development outside the four-street boundary of the ancient village was in 1771–72, when North Row was built on the west side of the open land. It was renamed Marlborough Place in 1819. One old building was incorporated into the street: a farmhouse which was refronted in the Georgian style and became the King and Queen pub in 1779. The name commemorated King George III and Queen Charlotte. Brighton was well provided with inns and beerhouses at this time: the town had 41 by 1800, or one for every 30 households, and many private houses sold unlicensed alcohol. At first the inn catered mostly for agricultural workers from the surrounding farms, although players and spectators involved in cricket matches on the adjacent open land also used the inn. (This trade ceased when the area was enclosed in 1817 to form parkland now known as Victoria Gardens.) An army barracks stood behind the pub, and for many years its soldiers were supplied with alcohol through a secret hole and passageway in the rear wall. The barracks, originally for infantry and later the home of the 1st Sussex Rifles and 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers regiments, closed in 1870; the Blenheim Hotel and the town's first courthouse now occupy the site. The inn's importance increased further in the early 19th century when Brighton's corn market was established there: it moved from another Brighton inn, the Old Ship Hotel, in or before 1822, and was held every Thursday. On 1 October 1868 it moved again to the former riding school of the Royal Pavilion, built in 1803–08 by William Porden. Other 19th-century events included the inquest of a man killed during rioting in Old Steine in 1817. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The pub and most of the buildings north of it, as far as the junction with Church Street, were rebuilt in the 1930s. Prominent local architecture firm Clayton & Black were commissioned to redesign the inn in 1931. Their chosen style for the rebuilding was Mock Tudor, which was fashionable at the time, and the bow-fronted two-storey Georgian exterior was completely changed to form a \\"striking interwar interloper\\" amongst neighbouring buildings such as the Neo-Georgian Allied Irish Bank branch and a series of four-storey offices. The interior was also altered to the design of Ashby Tabb of the interior design firm Heaton Tabb & Company, who added stained glass and a barrel-vaulted wooden ceiling at first- floor level, where a \\"children's room\\" was created. This later became a general function room. Clayton & Black extended the pub to the north in 1935–36, adding a two-storey section. Although the King and Queen name was retained, the monarchs represented were changed at this time to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and their images were painted beneath one of the gables. A contemporary report in the Brighton Herald newspaper praised the rebuilt pub, stating that it was \\"something more than a handsome, spacious building ... it is a gorgeous flight of architectural imagination\\". The pub has medieval-style decorative windows. The interior was altered in 1967, when the original three- room space was reconfigured to form a single room \\"in the form of a spacious medieval nobleman's hall\\". This made it suitable for hosting large events, such as \\"Miss Miniskirt\\" contest finals (for several years) and revues; Margaret Thatcher visited one unannounced in 1982 while in Brighton for the Conservative Party conference. There is a large courtyard and garden area, first used in 1968 when a new owner laid on regular barbecues. The pub markets itself as a sports bar, with large screen televisions and several pool tables, and as a music venue; local DJ Fatboy Slim has played there, and there is a regular karaoke night. The pub was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 19 March 1997. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. It is also within the Valley Gardens Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in Brighton and Hove. On 24 October 2015 it was registered as an asset of community value by Brighton and Hove City Council. Architecture This painted panel shows Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The two-storey north wing dates from 1935–36. The King and Queen has been widely praised for its distinctive, elaborately detailed architecture. Clayton & Black's \\"theatrical rebuilding\\", completed in 1932, created an architectural \\"pantomime\\" of \\"olde-worlde Tudor\\" elements incorporating \\"an impressive array of seemingly authentic details\\". The architects used a \\"wonderful assembly\\" of features commonly associated with 16th-century Vernacular architecture, selecting those which gave the most decorative appearance and allowed the widest variety of materials to be used. The main structure is of red brick laid in the English bond pattern; there is stonework to the ground floor, plaster and timber framing above, and a tiled roof with three weatherboarded dormer windows at the top (attic) storey, below which are the two main storeys. To the right (north) side is a two-storey section dating from 1935–36. The main section has five bays of unequal width; the first, third and fifth project slightly and have large gables. The third bay, the largest, has an entrance with a Tudor arch and double wooden doors, and there are smaller entrances in the fourth and fifth bays, again with similar doors featuring panelling and metal grilles set in moulded doorcases. Projecting forward between the fourth and fifth bays is the stone-dressed exterior of a stair- turret with a pair of Tudor-arched stained glass windows divided by a thick transom and set in a recess with a hood mould. The glass depicts knights and medieval ladies. The first (southernmost) bay rises to three storeys, of which the lower two have canted bay windows with mullions and transoms. The top storey, with its intricately decorated gable, is jettied and features painted plaster reliefs of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn with another mullioned and transomed window between them. Carved figures of the same king and queen are supported on brackets above the main entrance at first-floor level, in front of another medieval-style straight-headed window. Above this are gold lion and unicorn figures flanking carved corbels which support a three-light diamond- patterned window. On each side are smaller four-light windows of a similar pattern. A carved bressummer separates these from the half-timbered gable above. The second and fourth bays, slightly recessed, have plaster façades with applied carved timber framing and mullioned and transomed windows. The fifth bay, also plaster-clad, has two three-window ranges linked by a timber balustrade pattern and set below an elaborate gable with painted heraldic emblems, coats of arms and similar. Rising behind this gable is a stone- quoined brick tower topped with a chimney and another gable, from which two carved sheep's heads project. The exterior has a series of half-timbered gables. The north wing is mostly timber-framed with nogging infill. There is herringbone brickwork at first-floor level around the series of two-light windows. Much use is made of decorative ironwork: the ground floor is mostly open in the form of an oak-braced carriage arch with a portcullis, and between the brick piers which divide the wing into a series of bays are entrances with \\"fearsome wrought iron embellishments\\". The tiled roof has two gabled dormers. The part of this wing facing inwards towards the courtyard has brick and timberwork with balustrades and gables, and there is an open gallery on one side. Carved medieval figures are found in several places. Inside, despite the opening out of Heaton Tabb & Co's original three-room interior in 1967, many 1930s features remain, including a wood and wrought iron bar, a balustraded gallery (with later glazing), moulded fireplaces, decorative coloured glass with heraldic emblems, tapestries, timber panelling with linenfold carving, panelled doors with iron grilles, carved oak beams and lintels and medieval- style carved settles. A curved staircase leading to the first-floor function room apparently dates from the 1967 alterations; it has a balustrade and stained glass inserts.

He was born in Oxford, New Zealand, on 15 November 1914. He was the only child of Margaret Brenda North and husband John Ernest Holloway, a vicar in the Church of England.  Early life  Along with his mother and father, Holloway grew up in rural New Zealand until 1916. His family moved for several years until finally they settled down in the town of Dunedin. His father then became a lecturer of botany at the University of Otago. Jack Holloway spent most of his childhood attending a boarding school in Oamaru. As a small boy, he enjoyed climbing. After he graduated from the Waitaki Boys' High School in Oamaru he went on to further his schooling at the University of Otago, like his father before him. Holloway graduated in 1937 with a Master of Science degree and honours in botany and chemistry.  Alpine exploration  By the 1930s, John Thorpe Holloway was an established mountaineer. He explored many places, but two of the most known explorations he led were on the Barrier and Olivine ranges. Over the course of eight years Holloway made over 50 new accents on the Olivine and Barrier Ranges, including discovering twelve new passes, and he produced detailed maps. No one before Holloway had made maps of these mountain ranges. Once Holloway had mapped these new lands, exploration in New Zealand was changed. Holloway led many explorations during what were called the \\"depression years.\\" He would often trade maps that he had made for food rations in order to survive. Holloway became a member of the New Zealand Alpine Club.  New Zealand Forest Service  In 1938 Holloway sailed for Britain to undertake PhD studies in plant physiology at the Imperial College of Science and Technology and Rothamstead Experimental Station. The advent of the Second World War disrupted these plans, and he returned to New Zealand in November 1939 to enlist. Shortly after marrying Una Scott Stevenson, a lab technician, in March 1940 Holloway left New Zealand with the 11th Forest Company, Corps of New Zealand Engineers. Soon after he moved to the outskirts of London where he worked for four years in the sawmills. However, when Holloway was not working in the sawmills, he started a census of the woodlands that he was exposed to. In 1945, he joined the New Zealand Forest Service. Holloway began to work on the National Forest Survey. Holloway studied the forests of New Zealand and their native wildlife. These observational studies led to many of the papers that Holloway wrote in his life, including \\"Forests and Climates in South New Zealand.\\"  Major research  One of the more prominent studies completed by Holloway was his study of deer species in Southland. In this study, he observed the impact of deer species on the Southland environment. Holloway not only noticed that the species just east of Southland were thriving, but the species in Southland were nearly diminished. He proposed that this change could be due to the \\"virgin environment.\\" Holloway studied the Long Wood Range's deer population the most thoroughly. He found that the environment's deer population was the lowest in Southland due to newly operating sawmills and deforestation. Holloway believed heavily in the preservation of the natural world. After many studies Holloway stated that in order for society to thrive, then it must first think about its surroundings.

Early life  Holford was born in New Plymouth, Taranaki, New Zealand. Her parents were Captain J.A. Holford, Port Taranaki's harbour master, and Alice Holford, née Brooking. She applied to be a probationer (trainee nurse) at New Plymouth Hospital in 1886, however the hospital was not ready to train nursing staff and her father was also reluctant to allow her to train. As a result, she had to wait until 1897 to be admitted, during which time she helped her family with raising siblings and cousins, and went out with the local doctors on their rounds. She graduated in 1901, the fourth nurse to be trained at the hospital.  Career  Holford was determined to nurse babies, however there was no suitable training available in New Zealand at the time. So, in 1902 she borrowed money and travelled to Sydney to train as a midwife at Crown Street Women's Hospital. She was criticised for this by nursing colleagues who thought that it was inappropriate for an unmarried woman to deliver babies. On her return to New Zealand, she worked with Grace Neill to establish the St Helens Hospitals as training schools for midwives, and to have legislation passed to register midwives. The first St. Helen's Hospital was opened in Wellington in 1905, followed by Dunedin two months later. Holford was appointed the founding matron of the Dunedin hospital, and held this position until her retirement in December 1927. Her duties as matron were considerable - she oversaw all deliveries, and managed midwifery training for nurses, trainee midwives, and medical students. Holford also had to deal with opposition to the hospital's existence, as midwifery training was new and unestablished in the country at the time. Some doctors feared that trained midwives would compete with them for patients, and some older nurses, as well as the public, thought it was unseemly for young unmarried women to deliver babies. In 1914 Holford was one of a group of nurses who approached the Minister of Defence, James Allen, and suggested that New Zealand send nurses to assist in World War I. The deputation was successful, and led to the development of the New Zealand Army Nursing Service. During the war years, Holford was matron of the Hanmer Convalescent Home for Soldiers in Hanmer Springs, North Canterbury. Holford was active in a number of nursing and community organisations. In 1907 she founded a nursing group in Dunedin which later became a branch of the New Zealand Nurses' Association. She served as vice-president and president and was made an honorary life vice-president on her retirement from St. Helen's in 1927. She was a committee member for the New Zealand Nurses' Memorial Fund in the 1920s. Holford was also a founding member of the Plunket Society and was involved with the Order of St. John, Otago Pioneer Women's Society, the National Council of Women and the Red Cross. In her later years, she was instrumental in Dunedin opening a Citizens' Day Nursery for children, and a women's rest room in the city centre. Holford retired in 1927. In 1956 she suffered a fall while in New Plymouth for a nursing conference, and was admitted to Westown Hospital. She remained there until her death in 1966.

It is named after Rock Mountain on top of which the plant's upper reservoir is located. Construction on the plant began in 1977 and it was commissioned in 1995. After upgrades were completed in 2011, the plant has an installed capacity of . It is owned by both Oglethorpe Power and Georgia Power which have 75 percent and 25 percent stakes, respectively. Background After Georgia Power applied for a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license to operate the plant in 1972, they began to carry out design studies and plans for land acquisition. Construction on the project began in 1977 after the FERC license was granted. The initial phase included the tunnels, penstocks, roads and bridges. Construction was suspended in 1985 when the project was 20 percent complete. In 1987, Oglethorpe Power, who was in need of a pumped-storage plant, began negotiations with Georgia Power to complete the power plant. On 15 December 1988, the two power companies reached an agreement after Oglethorpe received a US$706.8 million loan guarantee. The agreement allowed Oglethorpe to operate the plant and have a 75 percent stake in ownership. Construction on the power plant restarted shortly after the agreement. In 1995 the power plant was completed and the generators commissioned. The project cost $1 billion and it was dedicated on 9 October 1995. An upgrade of the power station was completed in 2011 which increased the installed generating capacity of each turbine- generator from to . This increased the installed capacity of the plant from to 1,095 MW. The power of the pumps was also increased as well. The upgrade may seem early for the young power plant but the turbines, pumps and inlet valves were purchased before construction was suspended and sat in storage. Design and operation As a pumped-storage power plant, it uses two reservoirs to produce electricity and store energy. The upper reservoir stores water (energy) for periods when electricity demand is high. During these periods, water from the upper reservoir is released down to the power plant to produce hydroelectricity. Water from the power plant is then discharged into the lower reservoir. When energy demand is low, usually at night, water is pumped from the lower reservoir back up to the upper reservoir. The upper reservoir can be replenished in as little as 7.2 hours. The same turbine-generators that are used to generate electricity reverse into pumps during pumping mode. The upper reservoir is formed on Rocky Mountain above the lower reservoir by a tall and long continuous earth and rock-fill dam. It can store up to of water and its surface area covers . The upper reservoir lies at an elevation of while the lower reservoir is at . The lower reservoir impounds Heath Creek and is created by two embankment dams and one gravity/embankment composite dam. The composite dam is tall and the gravity section features a spillway with two tainter gates. The other two embankment dams serve as auxiliary dams. The lower reservoir can store up to of water and it covers an area of . Two other auxiliary reservoirs are located adjacent to the lower reservoir and they serve to provide additional water during periods of drought. Auxiliary Pool I is located just north of the lower reservoir and covers an area of . It is created by four embankment dams. Auxiliary Pool II is located west of the lower reservoir and covers an area of . It is created by an embankment dam and an outlet structure. Both Auxiliary Pool I and II are normally maintained at , a water level above the lower reservoir. They provide an additional of water to the lower reservoir. The Auxiliary Pools are also used to sustain wildlife and provide for recreation. The upper reservoir and power plant are connected by an long penstock which splits into three separate penstocks prior to reaching each of the three 365 MW Francis pump-turbine-generators. The difference in elevation between the upper and lower reservoirs affords the power plant a minimum net hydraulic head of .

Ghijsels is the founder of AIA, the biggest architecture consultant in the Dutch Indies. He was one of the instrumental architect in developing a modern style characteristic of the Dutch Indies. Biography KPM Hospital (now Pelni Petamburan Hospital), one of the first project of Ghijsels before the formation of AIA architecture bureau. In year 1903 Ghijsels studied at the polytechnic in Delft, where some of his fellow students included several future East Indies architects, Thomas Karsten and Henri Maclaine Pont among them. After his academic study in 1909, his first appointment was as a government architectural supervisor in Amsterdam under the firm of GA van Arkel (1910). In the same year he married Johanna Elisabeth Antonia de Regt in Rotterdam. By the end of September 1910, Ghijsels was accepted for the post of engineer by the Department of Municipal Works in Batavia, so he returned to the Dutch East Indies. From 1913, he worked for the Department of Civil Works (Burgerlijke Openbare Werken (BOW)), as well as becoming a freelance architect. Between 1913 and 1915, he designed the three-storeyed Post, Telephone and Telegraph office building (Post-, Telegrafie- en Telefoonkantoor (PTT)) in Surabaya, now Gedung Telkom; the building was one of the pioneers of modern architecture in Surabaya. Surabaya Memory Heritage Walk. Petra Christian University. He also designed the Post, Telephone and Telegraph Office on the site of the 1914 Colonial Exhibition in Semarang. In the same year, Ghijsels designed the Petamboeran hospital for the Royal Packet Company (Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij (KPM)) in Batavia, now Pelni Petamburan hospital Jakarta. KPM also commissioned Ghijsels to design the headquarters for the KPM, which led to the formation of the private architectural consultant AIA (Algemeen Ingenieurs- en Architectenbureau), together with architect H. von Essen and contractor F. Stoltz. The AIA was considered one of the biggest architecture consultant in the Dutch East Indies, with a building contractor. The agency expanded in 1927 with an office in Surabaya. In 1932, AIA bureau created an associate with another office in Bandung, led by architect FW Brinkman and GH Voorhoeve. Ghijsels was a key figure of AIA until 1929, when he had to depart aboard the SS Hooft to Genoa (May 30, 1928) and then the Netherlands. He remained committed to AIA where he worked from distance on a number of projects in the Dutch East Indies. During the 1930s, Ghijsels made a number of design sketches for his own house and a clubhouse for the Bloemendaal Hockeyclub (now HC Bloemendaal, July 1935). Ghijsels died on March 2, 1947 in Overveen. AIA The KPM Headquarters, now building of the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation, the first most acclaimed work of Ghijsels. The first project of AIA is the headquarters of KPM in Batavia (now the building of the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation). The project was a huge success and won critical acclaim. After the KPM headquarters project, AIA received many commissions for commercial buildings. Other AIA most famous works are the Kota railway station and Hotel des Indes (demolished in 1972) in Batavia. In Surabaya, he designed the Internatio Building for the Internationale Crediet- en Handelsvereniging Rotterdam. The hospital Onder de Bogen in Yogyakarta is one of the best example of a more Indies style. In Bandung, Villa Isola of press magnate Dominique W. Beretty, was designed by Schoemaker who was affiliated with AIA. AIA also received big commissions for the hydraulic works after it had been associated with the firm Sitsen and Louzada in 1936. Other architects affiliated with AIA were HA Hes (1918-1930), FBH Asselberg (1921-1931) and NE Burhoven Jaspers (1927-1938). Stoltz left the agency in 1921, while Hein von Essen had already left. From 1945, the office was led by Indonesian engineers Tan and Soetono. Today, the office still exist in Surabaya, under the old name: PT Biro AIA. Style Onder de Bogen hospital (now Panti Rapih Hospital) one of few Ghijsels work where he reveals strong Indies form, apparent in the roof form. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were two major groups of Modern architects in the Dutch Indies: those who followed the western architectural tradition in which they had been trained, and those that sought to achieve a synthesis of western and traditional Indies style. Ghijsels is definitely from the first - less Indies, more western - group, however it was known that Ghijsels made a separation between a more \\"formal\\" style for office and commercial projects, while choosing \\"informal\\" Indies style for schools and hospitals. Some of Ghijsels more Indies style are Onder de Bogen hospital (now Panti Rapih Hospital) and KPM hospital (now Pelni Petamburan Hospital). This distinction that he invented contributed to a theoretical discussion about the importance of the colonial Indies styleMartien de Vietter in Ibelings 2005: 118 The Dutch East Indies newspaper De Indische Courant on December 16, 1925 quoted \\"simplicity is the shortest path to beauty\\" (Eenvoud is de kortste weg naar schoonheid) to Ghijsels' work.

Personal life John Hobbs was born in Thanet, Kent, England, on 22 February 1800. He was the son of Richard Hobbs, a coachbuilder and Wesleyan preacher. In 1827 he married Jane Broggreff of Kent, and had five daughters and two sons. One of his sons was MP Richard Hobbs. He died in 1883 in Auckland and was buried in Grafton Cemetery. Missionary work In 1816, John Hobbs joined the Wesleyan Church. He became a lay preacher, like his father, three years later. At the end of 1822, Hobbs emigrated to Van Dieman's land in Tasmania, Australia to do missionary work among the convicts. Shortly after his arrival in 1823, however, he was persuaded to offer his services to the New Zealand Mission instead. He arrived in Paihia, New Zealand, on 3 August 1823, and proceeded to begin his mission at Wesleydale, the Wesleyan mission at Kaeo. Hobbs' ability to communicate with the Māori people in their tongue made him popular amongst the Māori population and became \\"unofficial counsellor to several influential chiefs\\". Even with Hobbs' help, the Ngati Pou chief of Whangaroa, Te Ara (George), found it difficult to protect the mission in Wesleydale. After Te Ara's death in 1827, the missionaries in the area were forced to flee to the Bay of Islands after hostile natives attacked the station. Hobbs returned to Sydney, Australia, and was ordained. Wesleyan authorities in Sydney were unwilling to abandon their missionary efforts in New Zealand, and established a new mission in the Hokianga district where thriving European businesses already existed. They placed Hobbs in charge of establishing the new station, and he arrived with an advance party in Hokianga on 31 October 1827. He helped establish a mission station at Mangungu, near Horeke. He spent five years in Tonga, from 1833 to 1838, then returned to Mangungu. In 1848, Hobbs assisted his son-in- law in establishing a new mission station at Pipiriki in the Wanganui district. On the way, the ship Hobbs was travelling on was wrecked in a storm, and from the experience, Hobbs became deafened which later made him incapable of active duty. He spent the years 1855–1856 resting at the Three Kings institution, and then retired from the mission. Legacy John Hobbs was greatly admired for his versatility in mechanical matters. He was called upon to tend to the sick, and his relationship with the Maori population was relatively successful due to his ability to speak their language fluently. He assisted in translating the Book of Job into Māori and was one of the three members on the committee that revised Robert Maunsell's translation of the Old Testament into Māori.

Professional career The Pittsburgh Pirates drafted Welker in the second round, with the 68th overall selection, of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the team on June 17, 2007. The Pirates initially planned to keep Welker as a starting pitcher. He struggled in his first professional seasons, before achieving better results.

It was still in development in 2010 but is intended either for homebuilding from kits or flyaway production, with versions meeting US and European rules. Design and development The Ion Aircraft Ion is a development of the DreamWings Valkyrie, a twin boom, pusher configuration ultralight aircraft which flew for the first time in 1999. The Valkyrie generated considerable interest and many potential customers, but DreamWings became bankrupt in 2001. The project was later restarted by a customer group under the name of Ion Aircraft and the part-built prototype of the Ion was displayed at Oshkosh in July 2005, though the first \\"hops\\" were not made until July 2007. Whilst the Valkyrie and the Ion share the share twin boom, single pusher engine, mid-wing layout, have tricycle undercarriages and seat two in tandem, they differ significantly. In particular the Valkyrie's strongly swept and tapered fins, combined with a trailing low set horizontal tail, which extended beyond the booms, have been replaced with swept, parallel chord fins with a constant chord tailplane linking their upper tips. Unlike the Valkyrie, the Ion does not have a canard. Much of the Ion is made of composite materials; the fuselage pod, the wing centre section within the booms, the booms themselves and the empennage are all formed from carbon fiber/epoxy pre- pregs. Outboard of the booms the wings are of bonded aluminium. The wings carry plain piano hinged ailerons. The engine cover is GRP. The cockpit has a single piece canopy, shaped to allow the rear seat to be 8.5 in (220 mm) above the forward one, giving its occupant better vision. The prototype has fixed, aluminium cantilever spring main undercarriage legs and has been flown with and without wheel fairings. The mainwheels have hydraulic brakes and the nosewheel castors.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 111. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Several options are to be offered, including a 3 ft 6 in (1050 mm) shorter span wing which will raise the cruising speed by 25 mph (41 km/h; 22 kn) but also increase the stall speed by 32%, a retractable undercarriage and a ballistic recovery parachute. Kits will be offered to meet either US Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) rules or European microlight regulations but flyaway aircraft will be built to LSA rules. Other engines, such as Rotax variants in the 100-115 hp (75-86 kW) power range may be fitted. In the two years after its first flight in 2007, the Ion prototype flew about 60 hours, some with a Jabiru 3300 six cylinder engine which experienced cooling problems but from May 2009 with a 100 hp (75 kW) Rotax 912ULS flat four engine. In 2010 it appeared at AirVenture, Oshkosh under its own power with a ventral air intake and a new three blade propeller. The second prototype was under construction but not registered in mid-2011.

Located along Bağdat Avenue in the Bostancı neighborhood of Kadıköy, it was a station on the Haydarpaşa suburban between 1951 and 2013, when the railway between Haydarpaşa and Pendik was closed. Starting in late 2018, the station will reopen to Marmaray commuter rail service. Prior to 2012, the station was also serviced by many intercity trains to Ankara and Anatolia as well as frequent regional train service to Adapazarı. Intercity train service is expected to return once the station reopens. Bostancı station is away from Haydarpaşa Terminal. History Bostancı station in 2005. Bostancı station was originally built by the Ottoman government, as part of a railway from Kadıköy to İzmit, and was opened on 22 September 1872. The station, along with the railway, was sold to the Ottoman Anatolian Railway (CFOA) which operated the railway until 1924. In 1909, the CFOA began frequent train service from Haydarpaşa and Pendik, stopping at Bostancı station, which was expanded and rebuilt in 1910. Frequent service to Bostancı promoted development in the area. Many houses with large gardens were built around the station for Constantinople's wealthy residents, who used the train service to commute into the city. Between 1912 and 1913, a ferry pier was built, just south of the station. In 1924, the CFOA went through a process of nationalization by the newly formed Republic of Turkey. In that year, the CFOA was bought by the Turkish government and merged with the Baghdad Railway into the Anatolian—Baghdad Railways (CFAB). In 1927, the CFAB was bought by the State Railways and Seaports Administration, the direct successor of the Turkish State Railways. The State Railways double-tracked the railway from Haydarpaşa to Gebze in 1949 and in 1951 began commuter rail service on the line. The station was electrified in 1969 with overhead wire, when TCDD began operating electric commuter rail service. In the 1980s, the waterfront of Bostancı was extended approximately outward, via land reclamation, extending the distance between the station and the ferry pier. On 31 March 2004, the station was given heritage status protecting the station building in anticipation of the Marmaray project. Intercity train service was discontinued west of Arifiye in 2012, followed by all train service in 2013 for the construction of the Marmaray commuter rail system. The rails were torn up shortly after but construction halted due to problems with the contractor. Construction restarted in 2016 with the demolition of the station platforms. Bostancı station is expected to reopen on 10 March 2019, along with the entire Marmaray rail line. Layout The pre-Marmaray Bostancı station consisted of 1 island platform and 1 side platform serving three tracks. Since the railway was only double-tracked, the third track (south side) was used as a passing loop to allow intercity or regional trains to pass local commuter trains. The third track would diverge from the main tracks before the station and connect back after the station. On the west side, the third track crossed the eastbound and connected to the westbound track and on the east side, the third track connected to only the eastbound track. The middle platform could be accessed via an underpass from Bağdat Avenue to Bahçelerarası Street, on the other side. The station building is located on the north side of the station and will not be altered or demolished, due to its heritage status. Connections Connections to IETT city bus service and Istanbul Minibus service as well İDO and Şehir Hatları ferry service is available. Bus service can be accessed via two stops, one on Bağdat Avenue and one on Çetin Emeç Boulevard, on the waterfront. Ferry service can be accessed from two landings; Municipal Şehir Hatları ferries stop at the historic Bostancı Pier, while İDO sea-bus ferries stop at the adjacent Bostancı Ferry Terminal. A long metro line to Dudullu is under construction and connection to its southern terminus will be available from Bostancı station. The line is expected to open in 2019.

Christakis and James H. Fowler in 2007. It has since been explored by scientists in numerous disciplines using diverse statistical, psychological, sociological, and biological approaches. Christakis and Fowler explored the influence of social connections on behavior. They described how social influence does not end with the people to whom a person is directly connected. People influence their friends, who in turn influence their friends, and so on; hence, a person's beliefs and actions can influence people he or she has never met, to whom he or she is only indirectly tied. Christakis and Fowler posited that diverse phenomena \\"ripple through our network, having an impact on our friends (one degree), our friends’ friends (two degrees), and even our friends’ friends’ friends (three degrees). Our influence gradually dissipates and ceases to have a noticeable effect on people beyond the social frontier that lies at three degrees of separation.\\" They posited a number of reasons for this decay, and they offered informational, psychological, and biological rationales. This argument is basically that peer effects need not stop at one degree of separation. However, across a broad set of empirical settings, using both observational and experimental methods, they observed that the effect seems, in many cases, to no longer be meaningful at a social horizon of three degrees. Using both observational and experimental methods, Christakis and Fowler examined phenomena from various domains, such as obesity, happiness, cooperation, voting, and various public health beliefs and behaviors. Investigations by other groups have subsequently explored many other phenomena in this way (including crime, social learning, etc.). Rationale Influence dissipates after three degrees (to and from friends’ friends’ friends) for three reasons, Christakis and Fowler propose:Connected Preface+chapter1 # Intrinsic decay -- corruption of information, or a kind of \\"social friction\\" (like the game telephone). # Network instability -- social ties become unstable (and are not constant across time) at a horizon of more than three degrees of separation. # Evolutionary purpose -- we evolved in small groups where everyone was connected by three degrees or fewer (an idea receiving subsequent support ). Scientific literature Initial studies using observational data by Christakis and Fowler suggested that a variety of attributes (like obesity, smoking, and happiness), rather than being individualistic, are casually correlated by contagion mechanisms that transmit such phenomena over long distances within social networks. Certain subsequent analyses have explored limitations to these analyses (subject to different statistical assumptions); or have expressed concern that the statistical methods employed in these analyses cannot fully control for other environmental factors; or have noted that the statistical estimates arising from some approaches may not always have straightforward interpretations; or have argued that the statistical methods may not always account for homophily processes in the creation and retention of relationships over time. But other scholarship using sensitivity analysis has found that the basic estimates regarding the transmissibility of obesity and smoking cessation, for example, are quite robust, or has otherwise replicated or supported the findings. Additional, detailed modeling work published in 2016 showed that the GEE modeling approach used by Christakis and Fowler (and others) was quite effective for estimating social contagion effects and in distinguishing them from homophily. This paper concluded, \\"For network influence, we find that the approach appears to have excellent sensitivity, and quite good specificity with regard to distinguishing the presence or absence of such a 'network effect,' regardless of whether or not homophily is present in network formation. This was true for small cohorts (n = 30) and larger cohorts (n = 1000), and for cohorts that displayed lesser and greater realism in their distribution of friendships.\\" Another methodological paper concluded that it is indeed possible to bound estimates of peer effects even given the modeling constraints faced by Christakis and Fowler \\\\-- even if parametric assumptions are otherwise required to identify such effects using observational data (if substantial unobserved homophily is thought to be present). Additional support for the modeling approach used by Christakis and Fowler provided by other authors has continued to appear . From a theoretical perspective, it has been shown that this property naturally emerges as the outcome of the interplay between social influence, or learning dynamics, and complex networks. These studies employ emblematic models used to study the diffusion of information, opinions, ideas and behaviors on a wide range of network topologies, showing also under which conditions violations of the \\"three degrees of influence” can be expected including of the three-degrees-of-influence property. Additional analytic approaches to observational data have also been supportive, including matched sample estimation, and reshuffling techniques. The reshuffling technique validated the \\"edge directionality test\\" as an identification strategy for causal peer effects; this technique was first proposed by Christakis and Fowler as a tool for estimating such effects in network analysis in their 2007 obesity paper. Christakis and Fowler reviewed critical and supportive findings regarding the three degrees of influence phenomenon and the analytic approaches used to discern it with observational data in 2013. In addition, subsequent experimental studies (by many research groups, including Christakis and Fowler) have found strong causal evidence of behavioral contagion processes that spread beyond dyads (including out to two, three, or four degrees of separation) using randomized controlled experiments,Rand D, Arbesman S, and Christakis NA,\\"Dynamic Social Networks Promote Cooperation in Experiments with Humans,\\" PNAS:Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2011; 108: 19193-19198 including one experiment involving 61,000,000 people that showed spread of voting behavior out to two degrees of separation. A 2014 paper also confirmed the spread of emotions beyond dyads, as proposed in 2008 by Christakis and Fowler, using another massive online experiment. The \\"three degrees of influence\\" property has also been noted by other groups using observational data regarding criminal networks. Diverse lines of work have also explored the specific biopsychosocial mechanisms for the boundedness of contagion effects, some of which had been theorized by Christakis and Fowler. Experiments by Moussaid et al evaluated the spread of risk perception, and documented inflection at approximately three degrees. Another set of experiments documented the impact of information distortion, noting that \\"despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals, the reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social distance of three to four degrees of separation.... We show that information distortion and the overweighting of other people’s errors are two individual-level mechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain.\\" And experiments with fMRI scans in a sociocentrically mapped network of graduate students, published in 2018, showed that neural responses to conceptual stimuli were similar between friends, with a nadir at three degrees of separation, providing further biological evidence for this theory. The theory has also been used to develop validated algorithms for efficient influence maximization. Moral implications The idea of network influence raises the question of free will, because it suggests that people are influenced by factors which they cannot control and which they are not aware of. Christakis and Fowler claim in their book, Connected, that policy makers should use knowledge about social network effects in order to create a better society with a more efficient public policy. This applies to many aspects of life, from public health to economics. For instance, when resources are scarce, they note that it might be preferable to immunize individuals located in the center of a network in preference to structurally peripheral individuals. Or, it might be much more effective to motivate clusters of people to avoid criminal behavior than to act upon individuals or than to punish each criminal separately. Their subsequent work has explored how to use social contagion to foster the spread of desirable innovations in rural villages.

As one of the wealthiest and most distinguished aristocrats in the kingdom in his day, he had one of the leading roles in mounting defences of Croatian statehood against the Ottoman expansion. Biography =Ancestry and family= The only son of Stjepan (Stephen) III Frankopan of Modruš, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia, and Ižota (Isotta) Frankopan née d' Este, Princess of Ferrara (present-day Italy), Bernardin Frankopan was born in 1453, most probably in Ozalj Castle, one of the castles owned by his family. The birth date of the new-born knez (prince) has not been determined with certainty. His grandfather Nikola IV Frankopan, the sole owner of huge estates possessed by noble family known as the Princes of Krk at the beginning of the 15th century and the first person to have called himself Frankopan, was Ban (viceroy) of Croatia from 1426 until 1432. In some sources he is referred to as Bernardin Frankopan Modruški (Bernardin Frankopan of Modruš), because at the time of division of Frankopan family property in 1449, his father inherited the large and important estate of Modruš, including Tržan Castle above the fortified town of Modruš, the seat of the whole large and branchy family. So his family branch took the title Frankopani Modruški (Frankopans of Modruš). Although exposed to Ottoman sudden raids from Bosnia in the second half of the 15th century, Modruš stayed the seat of the family branch and of young Bernardin as well. In other sources he is referred to as Bernardin Frankopan Ozaljski (Bernardin Frankopan of Ozalj, because he, together with his father, took over the spacious Ozalj estate with dominant Ozalj Castle after the death of Bernardin's cousin Bartol X Frankopan of Ozalj on 22 February 1474. Bartol (Bartholomew) was the last descendant of his family branch, so the Bernardin's branch took the epithet Ozaljski. On 16 September 1476 he married Lujza (Louise) Marzano d' Aragona, a daughter of prince (principe) Giovanni Francesco Marino Marzano and royal princess Leonora d' Aragona (daughter of Alfonso V of Aragon), and had nine children. Among them there were Krsto (Christopher) – the future well-known military leader, Beatrica – the wife of Ivaniš Korvin, Ban of Croatia, Ferdinand, Matija, Ivan X Franjo, Marija Magdalena, Elizabeta, Eufrozina (Fruzsina) married Dessewffy Ferenc, and Katarina. =Life in turbulent times= The life of Bernardin Frankopan was since his childhood marked by permanent tensions, conflicts and heavy battles, from which he tried to get benefit for himself, for his family and for Croatia. As a young boy he sometimes accompanied his father during diplomatic missions and journeys (appointed by the Croato-Hungarian King Matija Korvin) throughout Europe and got acquainted with many notable and important people. He spent some time in the court of the Friedrich III of Habsburg, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, in Graz, Austria, when he was a teenager (about 1469). As a young man he further fostered good relationship with the Emperor, but also improved ties with Matija Korvin. Nevertheless, the relation with the latter was overshadowed and harmed by the loss of the city of Senj, an old Frankopan property, in favour of the King in 1469. An especially good relationship with Ivaniš Korvin, King Matija's illegitimate son, was confirmed by Korvin's marriage to Bernardin's daughter Beatrica in 1496. The rich father provided a dowry of two fortified towns, Bihać and Novi, to his beautiful sixteen-year-old daughter. In 1493 he took part in the fateful Battle of Krbava Field, side by side with many distinguished Croatian noblemen. Because of bad military tactics ordered by the Croatian supreme commander Mirko (Emerik) Derenčin, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia, the aggressive Ottoman army won the battle. Many Croatian noblemen and most of the soldiers lost their lives or were imprisoned, but Bernardin was among those few who survived. Towards the end of the battle he saw that the defeat was inevitable and consequently retreated in order to save his life. A few years later (around 1500) he had a new castle built in Ogulin, a location north from Modruš, because the life there appeared to be a little bit safer. It is not surely known whether he stayed living in Modruš for quite a while or soon moved to Ogulin to spend the rest of his life there. Unlike his relatives from the other Frankopan branches, he did not support the members of the Habsburg family at the royal elections in 1490 and 1527, but was a supporter of their opponents. In 1490 he first backed Ivaniš Korvin against Maximilian I of Habsburg, and later accepted the newly elected king Vladislav II Jagiellon though. In 1527 election he supported Ivan Zapolja against Ferdinand I of Habsburg to be the king. As a man of diplomatic experience, he tried to get help for Croatia from the whole of Europe, but with little success. His inspirational and passionate speeches before European rulers, dignitaries or parliament members, claiming military actions against the Ottomans, resulted almost only in the words of encouragement, but no action. Well-known are, for instance, his speeches before Antonio Grimani, the Doge of Venice, and before the German Parliament in Nuremberg on 19 November 1522 (a speech called in (Speech for Croatia)). =Death and legacy= In the 1520s he lost two of his sons, Ferdinand and Krsto (Christopher) (the latter falling during the siege of Varaždin castle on 27 September 1527). His daughter Beatrice died in 1510, while her three children from the marriage with John Corvinus died before her. Bernardin's sole heir remained his grandson Stjepan IV Frankopan of Ozalj, Ferdinand's son, who was still a boy when his father died. Stjepan's sister Katarina married Nikola Šubić Zrinski, future hero of Szigetvár. Bernardin Frankopan died in 1529 (or perhaps in 1530; the exact time of death is not definitely determined) as an old man and Doyen of the Croatian nobility at that time. His descendants were later (during the 16th century) forced to leave many of their old properties (Bihać, Drežnik, Tržac, Furjan, Cetingrad, Mala Kladuša, Velika Kladuša etc.) and move to the west and north of Croatia, due to the Ottoman threat. Besides his military and diplomatic importance, he is known for his devotion to the culture development and improvement of education, as well as for his efforts in building and construction area. He improved and took care of Croatian language and Glagolitic script, and had the Bible translated into Croatian. In 1486 he published the famous \\"Modruški urbar\\" (\\"Urbarium of Modruš\\"), a book of legal norms and register of fief ownership, written in Glagolitic script.

Soon, there were allegations that Strelka was a clone of Rybka 1.0 beta, in the sense that it was a reverse-engineered and slightly modified version of Rybka. Several players found Strelka to yield identical analysis to Rybka in a variety of different situations, even having the same bugs and weaknesses in some cases. Osipov, however, stated repeatedly on discussion boards that Strelka was based on Fruit, not Rybka, and that any similarities was either because Rybka also was based on Fruit, or because he had tuned the evaluation function to be as close to Rybka as possible. With the release of Strelka 2.0 beta, source code was included. Rajlich stated that the source made it \\"obvious\\" that Strelka 2.0 beta was indeed a Rybka 1.0 beta clone, although not without some improvements in certain areas.

Crawford was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break. He was born at Hoo in Kent and was educated at Tonbridge School. Crawford made his first-class cricket debut for Kent County Cricket Club against Gloucestershire in the 1930 County Championship. Playing sporadically, he made four first-class appearances in that season, seven in 1932 and two in 1937. Following World War II, Crawford made a further first-class appearance in the 1951 County Championship against Northamptonshire. Making a total of thirteen first-class appearances, Crawford scored 150 runs at an average of 10.00, with a high score of 32. Despite his few appearances for Kent, he did make regular appearances for the Second XI, which he captained from 1950 to 1955, though he had played Second XI cricket since 1928. Described as an attacking batsman and good driver of the ball, Crawford was said to have a deep knowledge of the game. He later served on the Kent committee, and in 1968 was appointed President of the club. He later became the Chairman of the Committee, but almost immediately had to resign the post due to ill health.

They belong to the Mongo group of Bantu peoples. Although they practice slash-and-burn agriculture and hunt for bushmeat, they have little impact on the environment. The Iyaelima never kill bonobos, an ape closely related to humans whose population is much higher in Iyaelima territory than elsewhere. Location Lulilaka River in the Salonga National Park The Salonga National Park was established as the Tshuapa National Park in 1956, and gained its present boundaries with a 1970 presidential decree by President Mobutu Sese Seko. It was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. Most of the Salonga National Park is accessible only via river. The region in the southwest of the park occupied by the Iyaelima is accessible via the Lokoro River, which flows through the center. The Lokolo River defines the northern boundary and Lula River the south. When the SNP was established, most of the inhabitants were expelled but the Iyaelima managed to remain. The Iyaelima had gained a reputation as ferocious warriors, which they were careful to cultivate. They were allowed to stay under a law that categorizes them as \\"wildlife\\". The park structure is based on the American National Park model in which wilderness areas are cleared of their indigenous inhabitants. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has been pressing to do the same with the Iyaelima, the last remaining residents of the SNP. The Iyaelima are hostile to the park, to Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) personnel who manage it and to the park guards. They have not been informed of park laws, for example prohibiting trade in wild animals, and mainly interact with ICCN personnel over legal problems. Only one of the Iyaelima is employed by the park. Society The Iyaelima are patriarchal, with the men hunting and women farming and doing most of the housework. Few of them ever leave their territory, other than a very small number of coffee traders. A family will live in a one-room mud hut. A typical farm is a half-acre in size, cleared by slash-and-burn, on which they grow cassava, sugarcane and rice. Mangabeys, colobus, hogs and forest elephant graze in the secondary forest surrounding the Iyaelima settlements. All of these are hunted for food. The Iyaelima mostly use spears or bows and arrows, and are assisted by trained hunting dogs. The preferred prey includes various types of duiker and hogs. However, bonobos are never killed. The etoschi, a council of wise men, make the decisions in a village. Sorcerers provide protection through witchcraft. Although they cannot destroy an evil spirit they can prevent it from doing harm. The villagers engage in sacred hunts, slaughtering the animals they catch in a sacred ritual on a public altar. They bury their dead beside or underneath the family hut. Until recently they practiced cannibalism to feed their ancestors. Conservationists Juvenile bonobo Contrary to the views of the WWF and other NGOs, a survey by Jo Thompson of the independent Lukuru Wildlife Research Project concluded that the Iyaelima were helping conserve the environment. The Iyaelima recognise that some sites are magical, inhabited by water or forest spirits or by their ancestral spirits. They do not occupy these locations or hunt in them, and in return the spirits provide protection. They thus create natural animal sanctuaries. Lake Nkantotsha is a spirit lake of this type. Hunters are careful to leave areas of forest undisturbed to allow animal populations to regenerate. Based on aerial photography, the impact of the Iyaelima on the forest is minimal. The Salonga National Park is home to an unusually large group of bonobos, a species of ape that shares 98% of their DNA with humans and are thus our closest non-human relatives. The Iyaelima have a harmonious relationship with the bonobos, whose population is much higher in Iyaelima territory than elsewhere in the park. The Iyaelima recognize that bonobos are similar in many ways to humans, and see them as equally intelligent, but have no feeling of kinship with them and are insulted by the suggestion that they are relatives. However, they avoid bonobos when they meet them in the forest, thinking the bonobos may beat them up or kill them, just as other ethnic groups might. For this reason, they do not kill bonobos for fear of stirring up conflict with them. The ICCN is understaffed in Salonga, with just 137 guards for the entire area, many near retirement age, where at least 1,000 would be needed to enforce conservation laws effectively. The Iyaelima, with their profound local knowledge and track record of conservation may be an effective alternative to guards.

History The GWR on reaching Wolverhampton Low Level railway station in 1854, had built their own broad gauge shed on the opposite side of the Stafford Road to the existing Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway Wolverhampton railway works, between the road and the London Midland and Scottish Railway line to Crewe. Located opposite and accessible from Dunstall Park railway station, the shed backed onto the Stafford Road, with the throat facing Wolverhampton Low Level. As the major depot of the region, it was constructed as a heavy maintenance repair shop. But the GWR also needed a shed to replace the former S&B; shed, which had easier access to the freight yard which was on the opposite side of the line. The decision was taken to build a new GWR standard-pattern two-turntable with northernlight roof shed, toward Wolverhampton Low Level, which opened in July 1907 under the code OXY. Based on the pattern design set by Old Oak Common, the narrowness of the site meant that the two turntables were set one behind the other. Provision was however made for two further turntables should the need arise, and so the standard pattern twin-ramp coaling stage was offset to allow for future development. The two lifting shops had overhead hoists, while ash shelters were provided during World War II. In January 1963, both Stafford Road and Oxley came under the control of London Midland Region, who choose to close the dilapidated Stafford Road with immediate effect. All locomotives and servicing hence moved to Oxley from September 1963, which now gained code 2B. Closed to steam in March 1967, the shed was rebuilt as a diesel maintenance facility, housing both locomotives and DMUs. Present After Pendolinos were chosen as the preferred new rolling stock by the former InterCity West Coast Franchise holder Virgin Trains, Alstom needed maintenance facilities. The entire Pendolino fleet is allocated to the (Alstom) Manchester Traincare Centre at Longsight, where heavy maintenance is carried out. Longsight boasts a hoist on which an entire Pendolino set can be lifted. Lighter maintenance, cleaning and overnight stabling is carried out at Alstom's other centres: Wembley (London); Edge Hill (Liverpool); Polmadie (Glasgow); and Oxley, which were redeveloped for their purposes. Electrification of the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line from Stafford Road Junction to Oxley, is provided solely to enable electric stock to access Oxley TRSMD, and is therefore constructed as a catenary style suitable for low speeds only. The depot also maintains other stock manufactured by Alstom, including British Rail Class 180 Adelante DMUs and from 2021 will become the home depot, for Avanti's new Class 805 and 807, under a joint train maintenance agreement between Avanti and Hitachi Rail - the manufacturer of the stated trains.New Hitachi trains to replace Super Voyagers Rail issue 894 18 December 2019 page 6 References Category:Buildings and structures in Wolverhampton Category:Railway depots in England Category:Rail transport in Wolverhampton ","title":"Oxley TRSMD"},{"id":"34603777","text":"Veda Wright Stone (14 August 1906 – 10 January 1996) was an American activist who worked on the behalf of Native Americans.

Set in 1961, the film follows one week in the life of Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Isaac in his breakthrough role, a folk singer struggling to achieve musical success while keeping his life in order. The supporting cast includes Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund, F. Murray Abraham, Justin Timberlake and Adam Driver. Though Davis is a fictional character, the story was partly inspired by folk singer Dave Van Ronk's autobiography. Most of the folk songs performed in the film are sung in full and recorded live. T Bone Burnett was the executive music producer. Principal photography took place in early 2012, primarily in New York City. The film, a international co-production between companies in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, was financed by StudioCanal before it received an American distributor. Inside Llewyn Davis premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2013, where it won the Grand Prix. The film was theatrically released in France on November 6, 2013, and in the United Kingdom on January 24, 2014, by StudioCanal. It was given a limited release by CBS Films in the United States on December 6, 2013, before opening in a wide release on January 10, 2014. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Cinematography and Best Sound Mixing) and three Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical, Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Isaac), and Best Original Song. Inside Llewyn Davis has been held in high critical esteem since its release, being voted the 11th-best film released since 2000 in both a 2016 BBC Culture poll and a 2017 The New York Times list.  Plot  In February 1961, Llewyn Davis is a struggling folk singer in New York City's Greenwich Village. His recent solo album Inside Llewyn Davis is not selling; he has no money and is sleeping on the couches of friends and acquaintances. After playing The Gaslight Café one night he is beaten up in the alley behind the café, for reasons not immediately apparent, by a shadowy man in hat and suit with a southern accent. Davis awakens in the apartment of two friends, the Gorfeins. As he leaves, their cat escapes and is locked out of the apartment. Davis takes him to the apartment of Jim and Jean Berkey, where Jean reluctantly agrees to allow Davis to stay the night, despite already having promised as much to another aspiring folk singer/songwriter, Troy Nelson, a young military man stationed at nearby Fort Dix. Jean informs Davis that she is pregnant, and that Davis could be the father. The next morning, Davis opens a window and the Gorfeins' cat escapes the Berkeys' apartment. Later, Jean asks Davis to pay for an abortion, though she is upset it may be Jim's child she is losing. Davis visits his sister, hoping to borrow money. Instead she gives him a box of his belongings, which he tells her to leave outside by the curb. She mentions that he could make money by returning to the Merchant Marine. On Jim's invitation, Davis records a space travel-themed novelty song with Jim and Al Cody. Needing money for the abortion, Davis agrees to an immediate $200 rather than royalties. Davis looks to set up the appointment for the abortion, only to learn that payment will not be necessary, as he has credit with the gynecologist's office due to already having paid for the same procedure two years earlier on behalf of another woman who did not go through with it or inform Davis of her decision to raise the child in her hometown of Akron, Ohio. While talking to Jean at a café, Davis sees what he believes to be the Gorfeins' cat, captures him, and returns him to them that evening. Asked to perform a song after dinner, he reluctantly plays \\"Fare Thee Well\\", a song he had recorded with his old partner, Mike. When Mrs. Gorfein starts to sing Mike's harmony, Davis becomes angry and tells her not to. She leaves the table crying, then returns with the cat, having realized it is the wrong sex and thus not theirs. Davis leaves, taking the cat along. Davis rides with two musicians driving to Chicago: the laconic beat poet Johnny Five and the jazz musician Roland Turner. During the trip Davis discloses that his musical partner, Mike Timlin, died by suicide. At a roadside restaurant, Roland collapses from a heroin overdose. The three stop on the side of the highway to rest. When a police officer tells them to move on, he suspects that Johnny is drunk and tells him to get out of the car. Johnny resists and is arrested. Without the keys, Davis abandons the car, leaving the cat and the unconscious Roland behind. In Chicago, Davis auditions for Bud Grossman, who says Davis is not suited to be a solo performer but suggests he might fit into a new trio Grossman is forming. Davis rejects the offer and hitchhikes back to New York. Driving while the car owner sleeps, and distracted by the nighttime lights of nearby Akron, he hits a cat; it slowly limps into the woods as Davis watches. Back in New York, Davis uses his last $148 for back dues to rejoin the Merchant Marine union, and visits his ailing father. He searches for his seaman's license so he can ship out, but it had been in the box he told his sister to trash. Davis returns to the Union Hall to replace it, but cannot afford the $85 fee. He visits Jean and she tells him she got him a gig at the Gaslight. At the Gaslight, Davis learns that Pappi, the manager, also had sex with Jean. Davis drunkenly heckles a woman as she performs on stage and is thrown out. He goes to the Gorfeins' apartment, where they graciously welcome him. There, he learns that the novelty song is likely to be a major hit with massive royalties. He is amazed to see that their actual cat, Ulysses, has found his way home. In an expanded version of the film's opening scene, Davis performs at the Gaslight. Pappi teases Davis for his heckling the previous evening's singer and tells him that a friend of his is waiting in the alley. As he leaves, Davis watches a young Bob Dylan perform. Behind the Gaslight, Davis is beaten by the shadowy suited man for having cruelly heckled his wife, the previous night's performer. Davis watches as the man leaves in a taxi, bidding him \\"Au revoir\\".

Well before writing the script, the Coens began with a single idea, of Van Ronk being beaten up outside of Gerde's Folk City in the Village. The filmmakers employed the image in the opening scenes, then periodically returned to the project over the next couple of years to expand the story using a fictional character. One source for the film was Van Ronk's posthumously published (2005) memoir, The Mayor of MacDougal Street. According to the book's co-author, Elijah Wald, the Coens mined the work \\"for local color and a few scenes\\". The character is a composite of Van Ronk, Elliott, and other musicians from New York City who performed in the Village at that time. Joel Coen remarked, \\"the film doesn't really have a plot. That concerned us at one point; that's why we threw the cat in.\\" Shooting was complicated by an early New York spring, which interfered with the bleak winter atmosphere that prevails throughout the film, and by the difficulty of filming several cats, who, unlike dogs, ignore filmmakers' directions. On an animal trainer's advice, the Coens put out a casting call for an orange tabby cat, since they are sufficiently common that several could play one part. Individual cats were then selected for each scene based on what they were disposed to do on their own. After a chance run-in with a cabdriver who lived at their old address, the Coens used the apartment they'd rented several decades earlier. Producer Scott Rudin, who worked with the Coens on No Country for Old Men and True Grit, collaborated on the project. StudioCanal helped finance it without an American distributor in place. \\"After shooting in New York City and elsewhere last year ... the brothers finished the movie at their own pace\\", wrote Michael Cieply in a January 2013 New York Times interview with Joel Coen ahead of a private, pre- Grammys screening in Los Angeles. \\"They could have rushed it into the Oscar season but didn't.\\" On February 19, CBS Films announced it had picked up the U.S. domestic distribution rights for about $4 million. StudioCanal has rights to international distribution and foreign sales. = Music = Isaac and other cast members performed the music live, and did not use lip-synching. Dave Van Ronk's music served as the Coens' starting point for the script, and many of the songs first designated for the film were his. Van Ronk biographer Elijah Wald said that Llewyn Davis \\"is not at all Dave, but the music is\\". (The cover of Davis's solo album, Inside Llewyn Davis, resembles that of Inside Dave Van Ronk. Both feature the artist in a doorway, wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a cigarette. One difference between the two covers is that there is a cat in the doorway on the cover of Inside Dave Van Ronk.) Other songs emerged in conversations between the Coens and T Bone Burnett, who produced the music in association with Marcus Mumford. Burnett previously worked with the Coens on the music and soundtracks for The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the latter of which sold about 8 million copies in the United States. The Coens viewed the music in Inside Llewyn Davis as a direct descendant of the music in O Brother. The humorous novelty song \\"Please Mr. Kennedy\\", a plea from a reluctant astronaut, appears to be a fourth-generation derivative of the 1960 song \\"Mr. Custer\\", also known as \\"Please Mr. Custer\\", about the Battle of the Little Bighorn, sung by Larry Verne and written by Al De Lory, Fred Darian, and Joseph Van Winkle. A Tamla-Motown single followed in 1961: \\"Please Mr. Kennedy (I Don't Want to Go)\\", a plea from a reluctant Vietnam War draftee, sung by Mickey Woods and credited to Berry Gordy, Loucye Wakefield and Ronald Wakefield. In 1962, using a similar theme, The Goldcoast Singers recorded \\"Please Mr. Kennedy\\" on their album Here They Are, with writing credits to Ed Rush and George Cromarty. The Llewyn Davis version credits Rush, Cromarty, Burnett, Timberlake, and the Coens. Isaac, Timberlake, Mulligan, Driver and others performed the music live. The exception was \\"The Auld Triangle\\", which was lip-synced, with Timberlake singing bass. (Timberlake's vocal range was on display in the film. Critic Janet Maslin, listening to the soundtrack, mistook Timberlake's voice for Mulligan's, which she thought resembled that of Mary Travers.)  Release  Inside Llewyn Davis had its worldwide premiere on May 19 at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. It then screened at other film festivals, including the New York Film Festival in September, the AFI Film Festival, on its November 14 close, and the Torino Film Festival, also in November. The film began a limited release in the United States on December 6, 2013, in Los Angeles and New York. It opened in 133 additional theaters on December 20 and wide on January 10, 2014. On January 19, 2016, The Criterion Collection released a DVD and Blu-ray of the film, featuring new audio commentary tracks, interviews and other special features, including a 43-minute documentary, Inside \\"Inside Llewyn Davis\\".  Reception  = Critical response = Isaac's performance received widespread acclaim from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 92%, based on 281 reviews, with an average score of 8.51/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Smart, funny, and profoundly melancholy, Inside Llewyn Davis finds the Coen brothers in fine form.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 93 out of 100, based on reviews from 52 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". It was voted the 11th greatest film of the 21st century in a 2016 BBC Culture poll, after No Country for Old Men, another film by the Coen brothers. Writing for The Village Voice, Alan Scherstuhl praised the film: \\"While often funny and alive with winning performances, Inside Llewyn Davis finds the brothers in a dark mood, exploring the near-inevitable disappointment that faces artists too sincere to compromise—disappointments that the Coens, to their credit, have made a career out of dodging. The result is their most affecting film since the masterful A Serious Man.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"an outstanding fictional take on the early 1960s folk music scene\\", praising the \\"fresh, resonant folk soundtrack\\", and said Isaac's performance \\"deftly manages the task of making Llewyn compulsively watchable\\". IGN reviewer Leigh Singer gave the film a 10 out of 10 'Masterpiece' score, saying \\"Don't be fooled by the seemingly minor key ... this is one of the finest works by—let's just call it—the most consistently innovative, versatile and thrilling American filmmakers of the last quarter-century.\\" Folk singers have criticized the film for representing the Village folk scene of the time as a less friendly place than it actually was. Terri Thal, Dave Van Ronk's ex-wife, said, \\"I didn't expect it to be almost unrecognizable as the folk-music world of the early 1960s.\\" Suzanne Vega said, \\"I feel they took a vibrant, crackling, competitive, romantic, communal, crazy, drunken, brawling scene and crumpled it into a slow brown sad movie.\\" The film was also criticized because, though to some extent based on Van Ronk's memoir, it portrayed a character very different from Van Ronk, who, in contrast with the character Llewyn Davis, is usually described as a \\"nice guy\\" But at a press interview before the premiere at Cannes, the Coens said Davis was an original creation, and that the music was the major influence they had drawn from Van Ronk. = Accolades =  References   External links   Inside Llewyn Davis: The Sound of Music an essay by Kent Jones at the Criterion Collection Category:2013 films Category:2010s comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American black comedy films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Cultural depictions of Bob Dylan Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films directed by the Coen brothers Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in 1961 Category:Films shot in New York City Category:StudioCanal films Category:Films produced by Scott Rudin Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films set in Illinois Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Films shot in Minnesota Category:CBS Films films Category:2013 comedy films Category:National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film winners ","title":"Inside Llewyn Davis"},{"id":"34604066","text":"\\"Dream Scene\\" is an experimental composition by English rock musician George Harrison. It was released in November 1968 on his debut solo album, Wonderwall Music, which was the soundtrack to the psychedelic film Wonderwall, directed by Joe Massot. The track is an instrumental piece, apart from occasional non- English language vocals and a spoken word segment. It comprises three sections and combines meditative Indian sounds and singing with passages of Western instrumentation and avant-garde styling, including backwards tape loops and sound effects. After viewing an early edit of Wonderwall at Twickenham Film Studios, Harrison devised the piece to accompany a psychedelic dream sequence in the film. The song serves as the narrative for the sequence, in which a strait-laced professor imagines himself duelling with the fashion photographer boyfriend of the young woman he obsessively spies on through a hole in the wall separating their apartments. Harrison edited \\"Dream Scene\\" together from recordings made at different stages of the recording process for Wonderwall Music. He began recording the \\"Swordfencing\\" segment in November 1967, following his work on the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film project, and completed the piece during final mixing for the Wonderwall soundtrack, in February 1968. The recording sessions took place in London and the Indian city of Bombay. English classical musician John Barham was one of the contributors in London, and played piano and flugelhorn on the track. The song has been recognised by several reviewers as a sonically adventurous work. Some of these writers highlight \\"Dream Scene\\" as a forerunner to John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \\"Revolution 9\\" – a more widely known sound collage piece, to which Harrison also contributed, that was released on the Beatles' White Album.

In the context of 1960s Swinging London, the contrast between their existences, on either side of a connecting wall, symbolised the division between traditional norms and the younger generation's progressive thinking.Bryan Bierman, \\"Hidden Gems: George Harrison's 'Wonderwall Music'\\", Magnet, 5 January 2012 (retrieved 21 May 2017). Harrison viewed a rough edit of the film several times at Twickenham Film Studios to determine the type of music required for each scene. Using his notes from these screenings, which included precise timings for each segment, he then composed the musical pieces.Derek Taylor's liner notes, Wonderwall Music CD (Apple Records/EMI, 1992; produced by George Harrison). Typically of many of the selections in Wonderwall, the title of \\"Dream Scene\\" conveys its place in the story. The track appears in the film's first, extended dream sequence and was originally titled \\"Dream Sequence\\".Spizer, p. 206. The scene consists of an imaginary duel between the scientist and the model's boyfriend, a fashion photographer.Budd Wilkins, \\"Wonderwall – Blu-Ray Review\\", Slant Magazine, 28 April 2014 (retrieved 19 May 2017). During the duel, their weapons change from swords to various giant- sized items, including a pen, an electric drill,Charles Packer, \\"Wonderwall (1968) – DVD Review\\", Review Graveyard, April 2014 (retrieved 19 May 2017). a cigarette and a lipstick holder.Jay Allen Sanford, \\"Wonderwall w/ George Harrison: Lost 1968 Psychedelic Gem Now on DVD\\", San Diego Reader, 24 May 2011 (retrieved 29 May 2017). Recording \\"Dream Scene\\" is a composite of recorded segments using Western and Indian sounds that Harrison edited together. He began recording \\"Swordfencing\\" – a short piece that formed part of \\"Dream Scene\\" – on 22 November 1967. Following the completion of his work on the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour,Leng, p. 33. this session marked the start of recording for the Wonderwall soundtrack and took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.Miles, p. 283. Using a tabla player and flautists Richard Adeney and Jack Ellory,Harry, p. 393. Harrison taped four takes of \\"Swordfencing\\", in addition to working on pieces titled \\"India\\", \\"Backwards Tabla\\" and \\"Backwards Tones\\". The following day, he recorded a further twelve takes,Madinger & Easter, p. 419. with a line-up comprising two oboe players, a trumpeter and two flautists. John Barham, who contributed to much of the Western music used in the soundtrack,Leng, pp. 49–50. wrote the arrangement for flutes, oboes and trumpet. Barham also played piano and flugelhorn on \\"Dream Scene\\". Tommy Reilly played chromatic harmonica,Matt Hurwitz, \\"Wonderwall Music\\", georgeharrison.com (retrieved 18 May 2017). having originally been invited to contribute to the country-and-western piece \\"Cowboy Music\\". In author Simon Leng's description, the London recordings for Wonderwall engendered a spirit of improvisation and spontaneity among Harrison's fellow musicians, which \\"let the music 'create itself'\\" from his ideas.Leng, p. 49. Among the participants were avant-garde designers the FoolInglis, p. 17.Womack, p. 817. – Simon Posthuma, Marijke Koger and Josje LeegerEverett, pp. 145, 307. – who had created the psychedelic-themed sets for Massot's film.Alan Clayson, \\"Off the Wall\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 50.Howlett, p. 13. According to musicologist Walter Everett, the Fool played woodwind instruments on \\"Dream Scene\\". Other sounds and instrumentation on the Western portions of the track include drums, electric guitar, sound effects, backwards tape loops,Spizer, p. 207. and Mellotron.Madinger & Easter, p. 421. The Eastern sounds include hand drums, sitar and singing, the last of which Harrison sourced from a recording in EMI's tape library at Abbey Road. While author Bruce Spizer writes that the Indian musicians may well have included Aashish Khan and percussionist Mahapurush Misra, both of whom contributed to the Wonderwall soundtrack in London in December 1967,Howlett, p. 8. Harrison recorded most of the Indian music for the film in Bombay. The latter sessions took place at HMV StudiosLavezzoli, p. 182. between 9 and 13 January 1968. Harrison completed the soundtrack in London over the remainder of January,\\"Timeline: Jan 1–Feb 3, 1968\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 19. after which he and Ken Scott mixed the recordings. During this last process, Harrison edited \\"Swordfencing\\" into the piece on 11 February and overdubbed further sound effects.Madinger & Eater, pp. 419–20. At 5:27 in length,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 69. \\"Dream Scene\\" was the longest selection included on the album that Harrison culled from the film's music soundtrack, Wonderwall Music.Everett, p. 151. Structure and content Aside from \\"Ski- ing\\", \\"Dream Scene\\" is the only selection on Wonderwall Music in which the Indian and Western musical styles are combined.Madinger & Easter, pp. 420–22. The song consists of three distinct parts. The first is a meditative section featuring phase-shifted Indian instrumentationSpizer, pp. 206–07. such as harp (swarmandal) and sitar,D.J. Pangburn, \\"George Harrison: Forgotten Solo Gems\\", Death and Taxes, 25 February 2011 (retrieved 18 May 2017). much of which is reversed through the use of backwards tape loops. Hand drums (tabla tarang) then enter, along with vocals (sung in Nepali) that pan from one side to the other across the stereo image.Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison Wonderwall Music\\", AllMusic (retrieved 18 May 2017). Leng describes the effect as \\"hauntingly fragile male and female Indian voices in a love duet\\". The second part begins at 2:27 with what Leng terms \\"a charging John Barham piano vamp answered by a host of flutes\\". Drums and further orchestration also enter at this point. The third part starts at 3:23 with a portion of white noise atmospherics, which is soon contrasted by a graceful trumpet solo. Dual harmonica parts enter, interspersed with a police siren, followed by more backwards tape sounds; guitar, flange-treated piano and Mellotron are also heard. Music journalist D.J. Pangburn likens this final part to \\"Indian- inspired jazz\\". The song fades out with a slowed-down spoken voice over the sound of church bells. Leng identifies \\"Dream Scene\\" as a \\"juxtaposition of opposites\\" due to its contrasting musical styles and moods. He notes that it was recorded several months before \\"Revolution 9\\"Leng, p. 50. – Lennon's well- known sound collage, which incorporates musique concrète and other avant-garde elements, and was released on The Beatles (also known as the White Album).MacDonald, pp. 251–52. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter similarly comment that Harrison's contribution to \\"Revolution 9\\" \\"may have been understated in retrospect after listening to ['Dream Scene']\\". Release Wonderwall Music was the first solo release by a member of the Beatles,Rodriguez, pp. 8–9. as well as the first album issued on their new record label, Apple Records.Inglis, p. 18. Apple released the album on 1 November 1968 in Britain,Everett, p. 152.Miles, p. 313. with the US release following on 2 December.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 68. \\"Dream Scene\\" was sequenced as the final track on side one of the LP.Madinger & Easter, p. 633.Womack, p. 1015. In the US, Capitol Records, Apple's distributor, re- banded several of the tracks,Madinger & Easter, p. 420. so that the song appeared as part of a medley with the three tracks preceding it: \\"Greasy Legs\\", \\"Ski-ing\\" and \\"Gat Kirwani\\".Spizer, p. 205. On the mono version of the album, issued in the UK only, the mix for \\"Dream Scene\\" differed from the stereo release, due to the shorter fade-in given to the Indian segment and, in the final segment, differences in the content and positioning of the loops.Madinger & Easter, pp. 420, 421. The LP insert carried a message reading: \\"Special thanks to friends, loops and all the staff at EMI Bombay.\\"Inner sleeve credits, Wonderwall Music LP (Apple Records, 1968; produced by George Harrison). According to Simon Leng, the Wonderwall project demonstrated that \\"There were now three Beatles who held firm artistic visions\\". He highlights \\"Dream Scene\\" in particular, describing it as a \\"musical acid trip\\" that \\"rivals anything on Sgt. Pepper for sheer freak-out effect\\".Leng, pp. 33, 49, 50. In the 1980s, Harrison was dismissive of the Western music on the album, calling it \\"loads of horrible mellotron stuff and a police siren\\".Clayson, pp. 234–35. Barham said he considered \\"Dream Scene\\" to be the album's \\"most extraordinary track\\". Critical reception In a review for Uncut, Richard Williams likens Wonderwall Music to an exploded diagram of the Beatles' \\"overtly experimental period (1965–68)\\" on which \\"Dream Scene\\" is \\"a collage of found sounds, anticipating Lennon's 'Revolution No. 9'\\".Richard Williams, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years 1968–75\\", Uncut, November 2014, p. 93. New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid calls the song \\"experimental in [the] finest sense of the word\\"Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison: Dream Scene (1968)\\", Elsewhere, 21 March 2014 (retrieved 18 May 2017). and \\"by far the most psychedelic and out-there piece by any Beatle to that time\\". He adds that \\"towards the end you can almost anticipate Lennon's Revolution 9 coming in.\\"Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 18 May 2017). In his review for Classic Rock magazine, former Mojo editor Paul Trynka describes it as \\"serene\\" and, along with \\"Greasy Legs\\" and \\"Party Seacombe\\" from the same album, an example of Harrison's standing as \\"a talented film composer with a gift for evocative soundscapes\\".Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years 1968–75\\", Classic Rock, November 2014, p. 105.Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years 1968–75\\", TeamRock, 8 October 2014 (retrieved 31 May 2017). Writing for the Death and Taxes website, D.J. Pangburn highlights \\"Dream Scene\\" as his favourite track on an album that, as a non-vocal soundtrack, is often overlooked, yet contains individual pieces that show Harrison to be \\"every bit the psychedelic equal of Lennon\\" and \\"an astute musicologist and modern-day interpreter, surpassing even McCartney\\". Madison Desler of Paste includes the track in her list of the 20 best songs from Harrison's solo career. She writes: \\"'Dream Scene' is the standout [on Wonderwall Music]; an astral, Indian-influenced instrumental that goes from whimsical to nightmarish. It's the perfect accompaniment to the magic- mushrooms visuals of the scene, and evidence of a different side of Harrison's talents.\\"Madison Desler, \\"The 20 Best George Harrison Songs\\", Paste, 12 April 2017 (retrieved 18 May 2017). In a review for Uncuts Ultimate Music Guide issue on Harrison, Jon Dale gives the song four stars out of five and says that Harrison \\"flies in tape loops, edits together drone sequences, spools everything backwards, winds a police siren around a blasting harmonica, and generally treats the studio ... as the playground it so rightly is\\".Jon Dale, \\"George Solo: Wonderwall Music\\", Uncut Ultimate Music Guide: George Harrison, TI Media (London, 2018), pp. 38–39.

Harrison wrote the song in August 1969 as a message of encouragement to Bob Dylan, who was making a highly publicised comeback to the concert stage, accompanied by the Band, with a headlining performance at the Isle of Wight Festival. \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" is a rare Harrison composition in the country music genre and the second song dealing with the friendship between himself and Dylan, after their 1968 collaboration \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\". Its lyrics address Dylan's elusive nature, and reflect the high regard in which Harrison held the American singer's work. The same reluctance on Dylan's part to re-engage with a concert audience led to him retreating again from live performance until August 1971, when he responded to Harrison's request to play at the Concert for Bangladesh. Harrison recorded \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" in London early in the summer of 1970, shortly after taking part in a session for Dylan's New Morning album in New York. Co-produced by Phil Spector, the recording features a prominent contribution from Nashville pedal steel virtuoso Pete Drake, and twin keyboard parts from Gary Wright and Billy Preston in the tradition of the Band, whose sound influenced Harrison's arrangement. With its understated performance, the track is a comparatively rare departure from the big production commonly associated with All Things Must Pass. On release, Alan Smith of the NME described the song as \\"a tremendous piece of country-meets-Hawaii\\" and recommended that it be sent to country singer Slim Whitman \\"without further delay\\". An alternate take of \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" appears on the 2012 Harrison compilation Early Takes: Volume 1. Olivia Newton-John, Jim James, the Felice Brothers and Norah Jones are among the artists who have covered the song. Background In mid August 1969, Bob Dylan had confounded the media's expectations by shunning the Woodstock Festival, an event he had helped to inspire.Sounes, pp. 248–51.Heylin, pp. 306–07. Instead, after three years in virtual seclusion with his family, Dylan decided to make his comeback a fortnight after Woodstock, by headlining the Isle of Wight Festival at Wootton, just off the south coast of England.Sounes, pp. 250–51.Clayson, p. 273. Now a popular act in their own right, the Band agreed to back Dylan for the performance,Helm, p. 198. just as they had (as the Hawks) on his controversial 1966 world tour.Tillery, p. 114. In a repeat of his UK concerts from 1966, leading figures in the English music scene began to gather on the island to show their support for Dylan,Wyman, p. 342.Helm, p. 201. the singer widely considered \\"the minstrel to a generation\\".Clayson, p. 274. Alone among the many celebrity guests, George Harrison had spent time with Dylan during his period away from the limelight, in Bearsville, near Woodstock.Clayson, pp. 242−43.Leng, pp. 51–52. In between promoting Radha Krishna Temple (London)'s debut single on Apple Records, his own production of \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\",Miles, p. 351. Harrison and wife Pattie Boyd stayed with Dylan's family at Forelands Farm, near Bembridge, during the week preceding the festival. The two musicians strengthened the bond they had established in upstate New YorkThe Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 179. and were heard performing near-perfect impersonations of the Everly Brothers in the farmhouse.Harris, p. 68. Festival poster, showing an image of Dylan circa 1966 In addition to a crowd estimated at 200,000,Helm, p. 200. a group of 300 American journalists descended on the Isle of Wight, adding unwelcome pressure on Dylan.Sounes, p. 251. In the days leading up to his performance on Sunday, 31 August, the British press dubbed the event \\"D Day\\", in reference to the Allies' invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944;\\"The Isle of Wight festivals 1968–1970; Bob Dylan 1969\\", ukrockfestivals.com (retrieved 19 February 2013). in the words of music journalist John Harris, \\"Dylan's show had by now been inflated into the gig of the decade.\\"Harris, p. 72. As a further impediment to Dylan's planned comeback, audiences in 1969 expected to hear the rock music associated with his and the Hawks' 1965–66 tours,Helm, p. 199. a style that he had abandoned with his recent country album, Nashville Skyline.Heylin, pp. 301–02. This contrast was encouraged by the organisers' promotional campaign for the event,Sounes, pp. 251–52. particularly in the design for the official festival posters.Heylin, p. 307. Referring to Dylan's more conservative 1969 image, author Clinton Heylin writes: \\"There was little doubt that this was a different Dylan, even if the graphic on the fluttering posters advertising the festival was a stark black-and-white shot of a beshaded Dylan in classic '66 pose.\\" The arrival of Harrison's fellow Beatles John Lennon and Ringo Starr, on Saturday, 30 August, added to the heightened speculation that one or more members of the band might make a guest appearance with Dylan the following evening.Harris, p. 69.Stephen Stafford, \\"Why the Beatles never played the Isle of Wight\\", BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight, 15 June 2010 (retrieved 24 May 2013). Harrison gifted Dylan his vintage Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar before the showOlivia Harrison, pp. 202–03. and was then taken aback that Dylan arranged for \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" to be played over the PA minutes before he and the Band went on stage.Clayson, pp. 273–74. Mukunda Goswami, one of the six pioneer devotees who founded the Hare Krishna movement's London temple and who played on the recording,Dwyer & Cole, pp. 30–31.Greene, pp. 103, 106, 143–44. has identified this exposure as reflective of how the ancient Maha Mantra \\"penetrated British society\\" as a result of the Harrison-produced single.Olivia Harrison, p. 236. Harrison watched Dylan's performance from the VIP enclosure,O'Dell, p. 87. an experience that informed the lyrics to a new composition, \\"Behind That Locked Door\\". Composition Harris describes \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" as a \\"sweet acknowledgement of Dylan's shyness\\".Harris, p. 72. According to Harrison's recollection in a December 2000 interview for Billboard magazine, he began writing the song the night before Dylan played.Timothy White, \\"George Harrison: 'All Things' In Good Time\\", billboard.com, 8 January 2001 (retrieved 3 June 2014). Further to the statement of friendship in their 1968 collaboration \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\"Huntley, pp. 53, 56. – which Harrison began as a way of getting Dylan to let down his guard and \\"Let me in here\\"Timothy White, \\"George Harrison – Reconsidered\\", Musician, November 1987, pp. 62, 65. – in \\"Behind That Locked Door\\", he urges Dylan to confide in a friend and \\"let out your heart\\".Leng, pp. 89, 284. Author Ian Inglis notes the Isle of Wight performance as having been a \\"hugely important and anxious occasion\\" for Dylan and views Harrison's opening verse as a \\"personal plea\\" for him to \\"pull out of his depression, to face the world again, and to look to the future\\". After asking \\"Why are you still crying?\\", Harrison assures Dylan that \\"The love you are blessed with / This world's waiting for …\\"Inglis, pp. 26–27. In the second verse, Harrison sings of how he values Dylan's friendship, together with \\"the tales you have told me / From the things that you saw\\". For much of his career, Harrison repeatedly identified Dylan as one of his biggest musical influences, along with Ravi Shankar.Olivia Harrison, p. 202. To Inglis, these verse-two lines reflect the level of Harrison's respect for his work, since \\"while millions of others may look to the Beatles for guidance, he looks to Dylan\\".Inglis, p. 27. Bob Dylan and the Band on stage in 1974, the year Harrison faced criticism for his own change of musical direction Harrison musical biographer Simon Leng observes that, in the \\"counseling\\" Harrison gives Dylan in \\"Behind That Locked Door\\", he anticipates his own \\"slough of despond\\" during 1973–75. This self- styled \\"naughty period\\" of Harrison's coincided with the failure of his marriage to Boyd and a fall from grace with music critics following his 1974 \\"Dark Horse Tour\\"Tillery, p. 116. – a tour on which, similar to Dylan in 1969, Harrison defied public expectation and attempted to break from his Beatle past.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 128–29. In the final verse to \\"Behind That Locked Door\\",George Harrison, p. 205. he asks for Dylan's support in such a scenario: Musically, the song is set in a slow, country-waltz time signatureClayson, pp. 296–97. with, as Leng observes, melody and lyrics working \\"in tandem\\".Leng, p. 89. Within each couplet, a rising musical figure presents the \\"problem\\" (\\"Why are you still crying?\\"), while the second line consists of a \\"falling melodic consolation\\" (\\"Your pain is now through\\"). In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison offers little comment about \\"Behind That Locked Door\\", aside from identifying the inspiration behind the song and admitting: \\"It was a good excuse to do a country tune with pedal steel guitar.\\"George Harrison, p. 206. Aftermath to the Isle of Wight Festival Dylan's set at the festival was roundly viewed as anticlimactic,Sounes, pp. 252–53.Heylin, pp. 308, 310. if not a \\"Midnight Flop!\\", in the opinion of one British tabloid.Clayson, p. 309. Having recently told Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner that he would return to touring that autumn, Dylan abandoned the idea and also cancelled the proposed live album from his Isle of Wight performance.Heylin, pp. 302, 309. Showing support for Dylan in the fallout from his comeback, in a late 1969 interview Harrison included the American singer in his personal list of essential contemporary rock artists, saying: \\"The Beatles, [the] Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie, and that's it. Who needs anything else?\\"Clayson, p. 277. Inglis highlights \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" as an example of how Harrison's songwriting reflects his \\"fondness\\" for family and close friends.Inglis, p. 141. Dylan's reluctance to perform live again was only broken by his friendship with Harrison,Leng, p. 120.O'Dell, p. 199. when the latter persuaded him to play at the Concert for Bangladesh shows in New York in August 1971.Lavezzoli, pp. 189, 192–93. Although Dylan had been noncommittal about playing at that event until the last minute,Heylin, p. 329.Greene, pp. 191–92. a mutual friend of his and Harrison's, journalist Al Aronowitz, had assured Boyd, \\"Bob wouldn't let George down\\";O'Dell, pp. 198–99. another performer at the shows, drummer Jim Keltner, has said that Dylan felt a special closeness towards Harrison as a result of the Concert for Bangladesh.Lavezzoli, pp. 192, 203. Four years later, while Harrison was dejected following what author Elliot Huntley terms the \\"tsunami of bile that the Dark Horse album had unleashed\\",Huntley, p. 114. he spent considerable time with Dylan in Los Angeles.Badman, p. 164.Ray Coleman, \\"Dark Horse\\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 28. According to Mukunda Goswami, speaking in a 1982 interview with Harrison, Dylan became a regular visitor to the Los Angeles Radha Krishna temple and embraced the practice of chanting.Chant and Be Happy, p. 35. Recording Following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970, and shortly before beginning work on All Things Must Pass, Harrison participated in a recording session in New York for Dylan's New Morning album.Badman, p. 7. Among the many tracks they played were \\"Working on the Guru\\",Heylin, p. 318. Dylan's \\"gentle prod\\" at Harrison's association with the Hare Krishna movement, Harris writes, and \\"If Not for You\\", a new Dylan song that Harrison decided to cover on his own album.Madinger & Easter, pp. 424–25. Dylan also supplied him with a phone number for Pete Drake,Schaffner, p. 140. the Nashville-based pedal-steel guitarist and record producer whose work had graced \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" and other songs on Nashville Skyline.Clayson, p. 297. Harrison later praised Drake's pedal steel playing as \\"the bagpipes of country & western music\\". Working at Abbey Road Studios in London with co-producer Phil Spector,Badman, p. 10. Harrison recorded \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" during the first batch of sessions for All Things Must Pass, between late May and early June 1970.Madinger & Easter, p. 429. Drake's pedal steel features strongly on the recording,Williams, p. 154. providing a commentary to Harrison's vocal in the verses, as well as a mid-song solo, supported by Hammond organ from Billy Preston, and Gary Wright on piano. The arrangement for \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" reflects the enduring influence of the Band's sound on Harrison – through the use of two keyboard players, acoustic guitars, and a restrained backing from the rhythm section, comprising Klaus Voormann on bass and, in Huntley's description, Alan White's \\"shuffle beat\\" drums. For some years after the song's release, rumours claimed that it was the Band themselves backing Harrison on the track. Leng credits all three acoustic guitar parts to Harrison, although other sources suggest that Peter Frampton may have participated at the session.Spizer, p. 223. Harrison also overdubbed all the backing vocals (credited on the album to \\"the George O'Hara-Smith Singers\\"),Spizer, p. 212. a feat much admired by Spector, who has noted Harrison's willingness to \\"experiment upon experiment\\" with his harmony singing on All Things Must Pass.Olivia Harrison, p. 282. Release and reception \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" was released as the third track on side two of Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album,Spizer, p. 220. in November 1970.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. Ian Inglis writes of its position in the track order: \\"In the middle of an album whose songs sweep across the grand themes of history, religion, love, sex, and death, ['Behind That Locked Door'] is a surprising and touching gesture of simple friendship from one man to another.\\" The release followed speculation in the music press regarding the Dylan–Harrison joint session in May,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 179–80. and conversely, the critics' lambasting of Dylan's Self Portrait double album, released in June 1970.Sounes, p. 260. In his review of All Things Must Pass, the NMEs Alan Smith declared \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" a \\"standout\\" and \\"a tremendous piece of country-meets-Hawaii, which should be sent to Slim Whitman without further delay\\".Alan Smith, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\", NME, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 24 May 2013). Less impressed, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone dismissed the song as \\"an inexplicable bit of C&W; schlock\\", although he conceded that it had a \\"lovely, lilting background vocal\\".Ben Gerson, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass\\", Rolling Stone, 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 24 May 2013). Later in the 1970s, Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner highlighted \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" and the other Dylan-influenced songs on All Things Must Pass as being \\"far more intimate, both musically and lyrically, than the rest of the album\\".Schaffner, p. 142. Reviewers and biographers in the 21st century invariably recognise its place among Bob Dylan's work on his John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline albums.Spizer, p. 223. Writing in Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson remarked: \\"indeed, this tribute to Dylan's famous reticence sounds so close to a lost Zim original that His Bobness' own 'Baby, Stop Crying' (from 1978's Street Legal) is all but reduced to tributary status itself in comparison.\\"Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 15. Author Alan Clayson approves of the more \\"understated production aesthetic\\" next to what he views as an at-times \\"bloated\\" sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in \\"temper[ing] Phil Spector's taste for the extreme\\" and describes \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" as one of its composer's \\"more attractive\\" songs, with a fine lead vocal. \\"[It] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another's pain,\\" Leng adds, \\"suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe for a moment or two at least.\\"Leng, pp. 89–90. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams identifies \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" as an example of \\"how sympathetic to the performer\\" Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a \\"mellow, autumnal mix\\" that \\"beautifully display[s]\\" Drake's pedal steel.Williams, pp. 153, 154. Elliot Huntley writes that the track provides a showcase for Harrison's \\"melodic flair\\", as well as a reason to wonder why the ex-Beatle did not record more songs in the country-music genre, since \\"certainly he seems perfectly at home in these comfortable surroundings\\".Huntley, p. 56. Huntley speculates on the \\"interesting\\" possibility of a whole LP side of similar \\"ersatz country and western\\" tracks, as the Rolling Stones would do on their Exile on Main St. double album in 1972.Huntley, p. 57. Harrison biographer Joshua Greene describes the song as a celebration of \\"love's victory over pain\\".Greene, p. 181.

The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs the latter's Wall of Sound production technique to lavish effect. Its brash opening and choruses contrast with the ethereal quality of the verses – a loud/soft approach that has been credited with influencing indie bands during the 1980s and 1990s. Harrison wrote the song in 1968 and offered it to the Beatles in January 1969 for inclusion on what became their Let It Be album (1970), also produced by Spector. It is one of several Harrison compositions that were turned down by the band and subsequently found acclaim on his first solo release following their break-up. Harrison biographers recognise \\"Let It Down\\" as an erotic love song, perhaps written to a woman other than Pattie Boyd, his wife at the time. Separated by eighteen months, the song's conception and recording marked two periods of romantic intrigue involving Harrison, Boyd and their friend Eric Clapton. Author Ian Inglis describes \\"Let It Down\\" as \\"a dynamic and passionate depiction of lust and desire\\". Harrison recorded the song in London, backed by a large cast of musicians, including the whole of Clapton's newly formed band Derek and the Dominos, Gary Brooker, Gary Wright, Bobby Keys and the group Badfinger. With its dense mix of horns, orchestral strings and heavy rock instrumentation, commentators identify \\"Let It Down\\" as an extreme example of Spector's influence on All Things Must Pass, an influence that also provided a disruptive element during the album's creation. An acoustic version of \\"Let It Down\\", also taped in 1970 but with overdubs recorded in 2000, appeared as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary edition of All Things Must Pass. Background and composition An illustration from the Gita Govinda showing Krishna surrounded by devoted gopis – a traditional depiction that inspired George Harrison around the time he wrote \\"Let It Down\\" Harrison and Pattie Boyd were married in January 1966, having met two years before on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night,Clayson, pp. 167, 189. but by 1968, his dedication to meditation and Eastern mysticism had begun to divide the couple.Tillery, p. 67.Boyd, pp. 119–20. Harrison wrote \\"Let It Down\\" in late 1968.Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 8. The song features the same major-seventh chord voicings that intrigued Bob Dylan during that year's Thanksgiving holidays, when the two musicians collaborated on \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" in upstate New York.Leng, pp. 82, 90.George Harrison, p. 164. In the absence of any discussion of the track by Harrison in his 1980 autobiography,\\"List of Songs\\", in George Harrison, pp. 383–86. commentators have identified \\"Let It Down\\" as a sensual love song.Inglis, p. 27.Leng, p. 90.Spizer, p. 223. Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, describes the lyrics as being among its composer's \\"most tactile\\", full of \\"sexual passion\\" and \\"images of sight and touch\\". The verses, he suggests, \\"[revel] in the kind of sensory luxury any Krishna devotee is required to reject\\". Leng also notes the \\"clear climactic overtones\\" evident in the choruses, where Harrison urges his lover to \\"Let your hair hang all around me ... / Let your love flow and astound me.\\" Musically, the composition features contrasting moods between the ethereal, ballad-like verses and the more strident choruses.Huntley, p. 57. Author Ian Inglis terms \\"Let It Down\\" an \\"unashamedly erotic\\" song that most likely describes \\"an act, or acts, of infidelity\\". \\"Two lovers hide behind a veil of nonchalance, but both are equally aware of the other's intentions,\\" Inglis suggests, with specific reference to the third verse: The message behind the verses' recurring lines \\"I do, I do\\" and \\"Should someone be looking at me\\" has invited conflicting interpretations. Leng suggests that in the first of these lines, Harrison might be restating his marriage vow, and that the second line is an early example of the singer viewing his life \\"as a battle with an unseen enemy waiting to pounce\\". To Inglis, the characters in \\"Let It Down\\" are engaged in an adulterous affair, with the \\"constant threat\\" of being discovered – hence the conclusion to verse one: \\"Hiding it all behind anything I see / Should someone be looking at me.\\" Kinfauns, in Surrey, the Harrisons' home from 1964 to 1970 Harrison biographer Gary Tillery observes of this period when the song was written: \\"Despite his spiritual hunger, [for Harrison] the temptations of a rock star were still too much to resist. He had affairs with other women, and he became less guarded about them with Pattie.\\"Tillery, p. 68. One such affair took place shortly after the couple's return from New York, in December 1968, and involved Charlotte Martin, a French model who had just ended a relationship with Harrison's friend and occasional collaborator Eric Clapton.Tillery, pp. 68, 92.Boyd, p. 120. Harrison invited Martin to stay at Kinfauns, the home he shared with Boyd in Esher, south of London, whereupon, according to Boyd: \\"She didn't seem remotely upset about Eric ...\\" The Beatles' Get Back sessions Harrison and Boyd returned to England just before Christmas 1968,Huntley, p. 18. ready for the start of the Beatles' ill-fated Get Back film project, released as Let It Be in May 1970, a month after their break-up.Badman, pp. 4, 8. On 1 January 1969, author Peter Doggett writes, Harrison arrived at Apple's central London headquarters in an \\"exuberant\\" mood, inspired by his recent music-making with Dylan and fellow Woodstock residents the Band, and \\"enjoying the frisson of sharing his home with two beautiful women\\".Doggett, p. 58. Harrison put forward \\"Let It Down\\", along with as many as nine other compositions, during the Get Back sessions.Leng, p. 39. On 2 January, before the arrival of bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for the first day of filming,Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 5. he debuted the song to John Lennon at Twickenham Film Studios, in south-west London.Miles, p. 327. Tapes from this session reveal Lennon struggling with the song's chord changes, during a run-through that authors Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt describe as an \\"excellent performance by George ... seriously marred by John's distracting accompaniment on guitar\\".Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 7. Once the film project was under way, a combination of Lennon's barbed criticism of Harrison's songwritingHarris, p. 68.Huntley, pp. 23, 25. and McCartney's attempts to \\"dominate\\" him musically, as Starr later put it,Miles, p. 328. resulted in Harrison walking out on 10 January, apparently having quit the band for good.Rodriguez, pp. 379, 381.Tillery, pp. 86, 161. Doggett observes that, for Harrison, there had been \\"no relief from the tension\\" that week, since an upset Boyd had recently left Kinfauns to stay with friends in London. Following Harrison's return to the Beatles, and the film project's relocation to their familiar Apple Studio,Martin O'Gorman, \\"Film on Four\\", Mojo: The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition, Emap (London, 2003), p. 73. the band rehearsed \\"Let It Down\\" briefly on 25 and 29 January.Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 270, 296. Author Bruce Spizer writes of the song being embellished with \\"gospel-style organ runs\\", played by future Apple Records artist Billy Preston, during these late January sessions.Spizer, pp. 223, 340. Although the Beatles dedicated more time to it than to Harrison songs such as \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"Hear Me Lord\\", the track was dropped without being recorded,Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 7–8. due to a lack of interest from Lennon and McCartney.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 187. =Phil Spector's involvement= After engineer Glyn Johns had failed to compile a satisfactory album from the Get Back tapes throughout 1969, the project passed to American producer Phil Spector,MacDonald, p. 322.Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 313–15. via the latter's connection with Beatles manager Allen Klein.Doggett, pp. 64, 109. Like Lennon, Harrison welcomed Spector's involvement, and he offered a glowing endorsement of the producer's talents on the sleeve of Ike & Tina Turner's album River Deep – Mountain High.Williams, pp. 137–38, 153.Ribowsky, p. 250. In January 1970, Spector was in London discussing the possibility of producing a solo album by HarrisonDoggett, p. 115. when the latter invited him to a recording session for Lennon's Plastic Ono Band single \\"Instant Karma!\\"Rodriguez, p. 21. After this session, Spector urged Harrison to record his album,Phil Spector interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD (Village Roadshow, 2011; directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese). which would become the triple set All Things Must Pass.Huntley, p. 52. In 2011, Spector recalled of the material that Harrison had amassed, such as \\"Let It Down\\": \\"He had literally hundreds of songs, and each one was better than the rest. He had all this emotion built up ... I don't think he had played them to anybody, maybe Pattie.\\"Olivia Harrison, p. 282. Production =Initial recording= With Spector as his co-producer, Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Let It Down\\" in London early in the summer of 1970.Madinger & Easter, p. 427. Similar to the \\"libidinous detour\\" provided by \\"I Dig Love\\", Leng views the inclusion of \\"Let It Down\\" on All Things Must Pass as \\"a brief sensory interlude\\" from the predominant spiritual concerns found on the album.Leng, pp. 90, 97. In his discussion of the song, Inglis notes that this period coincided with heightened suspicion on Boyd's part regarding her husband's womanising,Inglis, pp. 27, 162. while music journalist John Harris has written of there being an element of intrigue during the All Things Must Pass sessions, through Clapton's growing infatuation with Boyd.Harris, p. 72. This development was an open secret to the musicians with whom Clapton formed Derek and the Dominos at this timeO'Dell, pp. 167, 172. – his fellow Delaney & Bonnie bandmates Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon and Carl RadleReid, pp. xii–xiii. – and to an apparently indifferent Harrison.Clayson, p. 297. Clapton sought refuge in heroin from his \\"torment\\", Harris writes,Harris, pp. 69, 72. while pouring his feelings for Boyd into the songs that Derek and the Dominos would soon record for their album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970).Reid, pp. xv–xvi.Phil Sutcliffe, \\"Derek and the Dominos: The Story of Layla\\", Mojo, May 2011; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 27 September 2013). Derek and the Dominos' Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock and Eric Clapton, pictured in 1970 Having also toured with Delaney & Bonnie in December 1969,Harris, pp. 69–70. Harrison used Gordon (on drums), Radle (bass) and the band's horn section, Bobby Keys and Jim Price, on the session for \\"Let It Down\\".Leng, pp. 63, 90. While Leng and Spizer both credit the Hammond organ and piano parts to Gary Wright and Gary Brooker, respectively, and list Whitlock as a backing vocalist only,Leng, pp. 90, 91. Whitlock maintains that he played the organ on the recording, \\"with the Leslie cranked [up]\\", and that Billy Preston was the pianist.Whitlock, p. 80. In addition to Harrison and Clapton on electric guitars, Leng and Spizer list Pete Ham, Tom Evans and Joey Molland of Apple band Badfinger as acoustic rhythm guitarists on the track. With its choruses presented in what Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes as \\"thundering, echo-drenched crescendo\\",Huntley, p. 57. \\"Let It Down\\" received a hard rock arrangement that recalls the sound of Wright's former band Spooky Tooth. Like Huntley, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as the most obvious example of Spector's influence on the album. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Madinger and Easter also credit the producer with \\"creating havoc\\" during the making of All Things Must Pass. According to Harrison's later recollections and those of Molland, Klaus Voormann and orchestral arranger John Barham,Leng, pp. 80–81. Spector's erratic behaviour and alcohol intake became a further burden on Harrison, alongside his marital problems and the death of his mother in July 1970.Clayson, p. 289. During a session at Apple Studio, Spector fell over and broke his arm; that and other \\"health issues\\" left Harrison to do much of the production work alone through to 12 August. =Overdubbing and mixing= While convalescing in Los Angeles, Spector wrote to Harrison with ideas for each of the early mixes completed in his absence,Spizer, p. 222. leaving his most detailed suggestions for \\"Let It Down\\".Leng, p. 91.Madinger & Easter, pp. 427, 429. Once Spector had returned to London, later in August, he and Harrison worked at Trident Studios, overseeing remixes as the recordings were transferred from 8- to 16-track tape – a process that allowed for greater flexibility when overdubbing further instruments and vocal parts. Among the subsequent overdubs on \\"Let It Down\\", Keys added \\"a wailing sax (old rock and roll style)\\", as the producer had described it in his letter, to complement \\"all that madness at the end [of the song]\\". Barham's string arrangements for All Things Must Pass were also recorded at this point; in the case of \\"Let It Down\\", former Melody Maker editor Richard Williams has written of Barham and Spector \\"extract[ing] a very unusual texture\\" from their combination of strings and horns. In Leng's description, the finished recording opens with Harrison's \\"heaviest-ever intro\\" – the \\"shattering concoction\\" of Harrison and Clapton's \\"angry\\" guitar riffs, \\"sledgehammer\\" drums from Gordon, and Wright's \\"roaring\\" Hammond organ – before the music \\"slips into the cool waters of a balmy, smooth sensuality\\" for the first verse. The horns similarly adopt contrasting musical textures, providing a soft, \\"Moonlight Bay\\"-like setting, as Spector put it, during the song's quieter moments. From its aggressive sound over the intro and choruses, Harrison's slide guitar reverts to a warmer tone, on a track that Leng views as Harrison developing his \\"unique voice\\" on slide guitar.Leng, pp. 90, 102. Leng also highlights the \\"gospel passion\\" of Clapton and Whitlock's vocal contributions, as the so-called \\"George O'Hara- Smith Singers\\".Leng, pp. 90–91. Release and reception \\"Let It Down\\" was released on All Things Must Pass in November 1970,Badman, pp. 10, 16. sequenced between the two minimalist, Band-influencedLeng, p. 102. tracks \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" and \\"Run of the Mill\\".Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. Writing in 1977 of the acclaim afforded the album on release, author Nicholas Schaffner described All Things Must Pass as the \\"crowning glory\\" of Harrison and Spector's respective careers, and concluded: \\"Spector was at last working with a talent comparable with his own. The producer's cosmic sound proved a perfect complement to the artist's cosmic vision.\\"Schaffner, pp. 138, 142. Author Robert Rodriguez groups \\"Let It Down\\" with other Beatles-era compositions such as \\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"Wah-Wah\\", as the \\"essential components\\" of an album that was \\"revelatory, helping the public understand that, with a talent this big alongside two acknowledged geniuses [in Lennon and McCartney], no wonder the group could not remain intact\\".Rodriguez, pp. 5, 253. In his album review for the NME, Alan Smith noted \\"Let It Down\\"'s \\"big fuzzy\\" introduction against its verses' \\"quiet acid float\\" and admired the \\"romantic delicacy and perception\\" of Harrison's lyrics. \\"No matter the quality of the music,\\" Smith added, \\"his words never let him down.\\"Alan Smith, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\", NME, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 17 May 2013). In a retrospective review for Rolling Stone, James Hunter cited the \\"grooving\\" performance on \\"Let It Down\\" as an example of how All Things Must Pass represents \\"a rock orchestra recorded with sensitivity and teeth and faraway mikes\\". Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham considers that without Spector's Wall of Sound excesses, Harrison's triple album \\"wouldn't be the magnificently overblown item that it is\\".Ingham, pp. 132–33. Ingham comments on \\"the sheer size of the sound\\" on tracks such as \\"Let It Down\\", \\"Wah-Wah\\" and \\"What Is Life\\", all of which \\"build up a head of steam that could only be generated by multiple live takes of dozens of musicians playing their hearts out\\".Ingham, p. 133. Bruce Spizer has written of the \\"unfortunate\\" decision that saw \\"Let It Down\\" rejected by the Beatles in 1969, since \\"it is one of George's most exquisite and sensual love songs.\\" Elliot Huntley finds the same decision \\"perverse\\" and enthuses: \\"I simply don't have enough hyperbole for 'Let It Down' ... Spector really earns his corn on this track ...\\"Huntley, pp. 21, 57. Huntley writes that the song's much-admired \\"soft/loud approach\\" would be \\"ripped off by every indie band in the world a generation later\\", a point to which John Bergstrom of PopMatters adds: \\"How many guitar-driven, echo-drenched bands have come around since [All Things Must Pass], mixing powerful rave-ups with moody, reflective down-tempo numbers and a spiritual bent? ... [One] listen to 'Let It Down', and you'll understand a big part of how 'Dream Pop' came to be.\\"John Bergstrom, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass\\", PopMatters, 14 January 2011 (retrieved 28 January 2015). Also impressed with the song's musical moods, Ian Inglis writes: \\"The switches between periods of pulsating rhythm and interludes of musical calm echo the ebb and flow of seduction itself. Like a painter who uses contrasting colors to create tension and movement, Harrison is ... using the tools of the songwriter to create a dynamic and passionate depiction of lust and desire.\\" Madinger and Easter describe the track as \\"an absolutely apocalyptic production\\" and \\"the best example of Spector running rampant with the 'Wall of Sound'\\". Writing in his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams views \\"Let It Down\\" as \\"the record's most thrilling track\\", adding that it \\"picks the listener up and, in the best Spector tradition, never lets him down, building an electrifying tension between the subdued, reverential verses and the roaring chorus\\".Williams, p. 154. In September 2014, the song appeared as Harrison's selection on the solo Beatles EP 4: John Paul George Ringo, exclusive to iTunes.\\"'4: John Paul George Ringo' EP available now for free from Apple's iTunes Store\\", MacDailyNews, 24 September 2014 (retrieved 27 September 2014).

Available on bootleg compilations such as the multi-disc Making of All Things Must Pass\\"George Harrison – The Making of All Things Must Pass (Disc 1)\\", Bootleg Zone (retrieved 20 January 2015). and Songs for Patti – The Mastertape Version, the mixes demonstrate the layers of instrumentation that were combined to form the commercially released recording – ranging from a sparse backing of just guitar, bass and drums, to the larger sound following brass and slide guitar overdubs. Madinger and Easter write that \\"Let It Down\\" was \\"a much rougher, rockin' track in its initial phase\\", and the mixes provide a \\"fascinating view\\" of how the song could have ended up without the heavy production favoured by Spector.Madinger & Easter, p. 429.

History Since the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in the language in Britain. Teachers like Siobhán Uí Néill and Seoirse Ó Broin did much to promote the language in Britain during the 1980s. However, rapid growth occurred in 2000, with the establishment of Coláiste na nGael. This cultural organisation was, from the outset committed to a non-religious and non-political ethos. In the words of its founder, Christy Evans: “Coláiste na nGael has only one aim – to share our ancient and beautiful language with the world”. Coláiste na nGael now operates in over twenty British cities, and has teachers and students from a wide range of social and ethnic backgrounds. The organisation has held events at the Eden Project in Cornwall, the British Museum in London, Reykjavík in Iceland, the Basque Country, Brittany and many other locations. Coláiste na nGael has won a number of cultural awards. Christy Evans won the Léargas Language Ambassador Award in 2006, and the Glór na nGael ‘Global Gaeilge’ Award in 2008 and 2010. Christy Evans also won a ‘Pride of Ireland’ Award in 2007.Christy Evans, founder of Coláiste na nGael Coláiste na nGael also conducts research, and its work on the Irish language in Britain was presented to 10 Downing Street in 2011.

A paean to free love, it marks a departure from the more profound, spiritually oriented subject matter of much of that album. Musically, the song reflects Harrison's early experimentation with slide guitar, a technique that he was introduced to while touring with Delaney & Bonnie and Friends in December 1969. Typically of much of the material on All Things Must Pass, the recording features an extended line-up of musicians, including three guitarists, two drummers and three keyboard players. Among the musicians were former Delaney & Bonnie band members Eric Clapton, Bobby Whitlock and Dave Mason, along with Billy Preston and Ringo Starr. The track was co-produced by Phil Spector and recorded in London. On release, it was among the album's most popular songs on US radio. Given the high standard of Harrison's songwriting on All Things Must Pass, however, several of his biographers have since held \\"I Dig Love\\" in low regard and consider it to be one of the album's weakest tracks. Indian singer Asha Puthli and American band the Black Crowes have both covered the song. Part of Puthli's version was sampled by British rapper Kano for his 2005 track \\"Reload It\\". Background Like \\"Woman Don't You Cry for Me\\" and \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\", \\"I Dig Love\\" originated from George Harrison's initial experimentation with slide-guitar playing, in open E tuning.Harrison, pp. 172, 234. His introduction to this technique occurred in December 1969, when he joined Eric Clapton as a guest on Delaney & Bonnie's European tour.Clayson, pp. 278–80.Miles, pp. 360–62. In his autobiography, I Me Mine, Harrison recalls that Delaney Bramlett \\"handed me a bottleneck slide and asked me to play a line which Dave Mason had played on the ['Coming Home'] record\\",Harrison, p. 172. since Mason had recently quit the tour.Clayson, p. 279.John Harris, \\"A Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, July 2001, p. 70. With Harrison travelling without his wife, Pattie Boyd, the Delaney & Bonnie tour revealed an aspect of his persona that was at odds with his public image as the Beatle most preoccupied with Eastern religion and spirituality. Despite Harrison's strong ties to the Hare Krishna movement, whose core principles espoused a life of abstinence,Clayson, pp. 267–68, 298–99. Bramlett later recalled him \\"let[ting] his hair down\\" on the tour, in a manner reminiscent of the Beatles' pre-fame years in Hamburg.Leng, pp. 66–67. With regard to the inclusion of \\"I Dig Love\\" on Harrison's first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass, author Simon Leng describes it as an \\"unusually libidinous detour\\", similar to the \\"brief sensory interlude\\" offered by the track \\"Let It Down\\".Leng, pp. 91, 97. Leng notes that the composition is one of the few that Harrison fails to either discuss in his autobiography or include in the two-volume Songs by George Harrison; this repeated omission, Leng concludes, \\"perhaps suggests what its writer ultimately thought of [the song]\\". Composition Musically, \\"I Dig Love\\" is built around a riff, played primarily on piano, that first descends before retracing the same notes back to its starting point. In a contemporary review of All Things Must Pass, music journalist Alan Smith likened the sequence to \\"The Pink Panther Theme\\" by Henry Mancini. Leng writes that, with the repeated declaration of \\"I dig love every morning / I dig love every evening\\", Harrison's lyrics reflect the \\"loosening of social taboos about sex and sexuality\\", an issue that was at the forefront of the 1960s countercultural revolution. While also viewing the lyrics as a marked departure from the predominantly spiritual themes found on All Things Must Pass, theologian Dale Allison describes \\"I Dig Love\\" as an endorsement of that era's free love movement.Allison, p. 145. Leng cites lines from the song's first verseAlbum booklet, All Things Must Pass (30th Anniversary Edition) CD (Gnome Records, 2001; produced by George Harrison & Phil Spector). as being a mix of \\"Pseudo-Dylanesque wordplay\\" and \\"George's schoolboy jokes\\":Leng, p. 97. Leng draws parallels between \\"I Dig Love\\" and the Beatles' more free-form compositions of the late 1960s. Among these, Paul McCartney's \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" exemplifies what Ian MacDonald termed in the 1990s the \\"long- gone let-it-all-hang-out era\\".MacDonald, pp. 284–85. In his book Working Class Mystic, Gary Tillery identifies \\"I Dig Love\\" as one of two All Things Must Pass tracks (the other being \\"Wah-Wah\\") that could have been sung by John Lennon,Tillery, p. 90. whose style increasingly embraced provocative artistic statements following the start of his relationship with Yoko Ono in 1968.MacDonald, pp. 247, 253, 284, 303. Leng also compares \\"I Dig Love\\" with \\"Love the One You're With\\", a \\"hymn to hedonism\\" by Stephen Stills, with whom Harrison worked on Doris Troy's eponymous album for Apple Records, in 1969–70.Leng, pp. 61, 97. Recording The basic track for \\"I Dig Love\\" was recorded in London, either at Abbey Road Studios or Trident, between June and August 1970.Badman, p. 10. As on many of the sessions for All Things Must Pass,Shapiro, p. 116. the contributing musicians included members of Delaney & Bonnie's 1969 tour band, including Bobby Whitlock and Jim Gordon,Leng, pp. 63, 97. both of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton at this time.Spizer, p. 220. According to Leng and author Bruce Spizer, Whitlock provided the piano part on the recording, while the Wurlitzer electric piano and Hammond organ were played by Gary Wright and Billy Preston, respectively. In his autobiography, however, Whitlock states that, being a non-pianist at this stage of his career, he played organ on the track, while Preston supplied the piano part.Whitlock, pp. 81–82. Accompanying Harrison on electric guitars (at least two of which were played using a slide) were Clapton and Mason, while Ringo Starr contributed the drum fills that complement the main riff, alongside Gordon on a second drum kit. While Leng and Spizer credit Klaus Voormann for the bass guitar part, Whitlock lists Carl Radle,Whitlock, p. 81. his former Delaney & Bonnie bandmate and the fourth member of Derek and the Dominos.William Ruhlmann, \\"Derek and the Dominos\\", AllMusic (retrieved 17 January 2015). In Whitlock's recollection, Mason joined the proceedings right at the end of the sessions for the album's basic tracks, making \\"I Dig Love\\" one of the final songs recorded.Whitlock, p. 82. Described by Leng as \\"sassy\\", Harrison's slide guitar solo was added during the album's principal overdubbing phase, which ended on 12 August.Madinger & Easter, p. 427. Frequently absent from the All Things Must Pass sessions,Clayson, p. 289.Spizer, p. 222. his co-producer, Phil Spector, had recommended in a letter dated 19 August that a synthesizer be added onto the song's intro – a suggestion that Harrison apparently ignored, according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter.Madinger & Easter, pp. 427, 431. Release and reception \\"I Dig Love\\" was released in November 1970Badman, p. 16. as the opening track on side four of All Things Must Pass, in its original LP format.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. Reviewing the album for the NME, Alan Smith described the song as a \\"simple and effective opener\\"Alan Smith, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\", NME, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 18 August 2012). that would \\"stand the passage of time\\".Hunt, p. 32. Author Robert Rodriguez includes the track among examples of how the musical diversity on All Things Must Pass surprised listeners, following Lennon and McCartney's dominance as songwriters in the Beatles.Rodriguez, pp. 5, 147. Rodriguez writes: \\"That the 'Quiet Beatle' was capable of such range – from the joyful 'What Is Life' to the meditative 'Isn't It a Pity' to the steamrolling 'Art of Dying' to the playful 'I Dig Love' – was truly revelatory.\\"Rodriguez, p. 147. In addition to receiving critical acclaim for the quality of its songs,Hunt, pp. 12, 22. the album was noted for introducing Harrison as a slide guitarist,Lavezzoli, p. 186. a role that contributed to his signature sound as a solo artist.Paul Du Noyer, \\"George Harrison's All Things Must Pass\\" , pauldunoyer.com, 13 March 2009 (retrieved 18 January 2015).Leng, pp. 102–03.

Self, \\"The 'My Sweet Lord'/'He's So Fine' Plagiarism Suit\\" , Abbeyrd's Beatles Page (retrieved 17 January 2015). Among Harrison and Beatles biographers, opinions on \\"I Dig Love\\" have been less favourable in the ensuing decades. Alan Clayson suggests that, given the abundance of quality music on Harrison's triple album, the track \\"could have been ditched without any hardship\\", together with the second of the two versions of \\"Isn't It a Pity\\".Clayson, p. 291. Bruce Spizer finds the song \\"catchy and at times interesting\\" musically, with \\"some excellent guitar playing\\", but considers the words \\"trite\\" by Harrison's standards.Spizer, p. 225. Simon Leng bemoans the song's \\"hackneyed, falling- and-rising chromatic chord pattern\\" and lyrics that are \\"probably the weakest of Harrison's career\\", and suggests that the 1970 outtake \\"I Live for You\\" would have been a preferable inclusion.Leng, pp. 97, 284–85. Leng adds that Harrison's guitar solo and \\"particularly strong\\" vocal performance on \\"I Dig Love\\" \\"almost save the day\\", yet the song \\"lacks the expressive clout\\" of the rest of its parent album. Ian Inglis similarly dismisses \\"I Dig Love\\", describing it as repetitive and lyrically simplistic.Inglis, p. 30. While also comparing the composition with Stills' \\"Love the One You're With\\", he opines: \\"But whereas that song is a celebratory endorsement of 'free love,' Harrison's is a gloomy and unconvincing contribution.\\"Inglis, pp. 30–31. Elliot Huntley views the track as \\"a rather scantily clad four-chord throwaway\\" and \\"the closest thing to filler on the entire album\\". Recognising the need for \\"a little light relief\\", Huntley concludes: \\"'I Dig Love' can best be described as audacious songwriting, believing that everything will work out in the studio. And the song succeeds almost despite itself.\\"Huntley, p. 59. Cover versions Indian singer Asha Puthli recorded \\"I Dig Love\\", creating a version that Jon Pareles of The New York Times describes as \\"a wild, post-psychedelic artifact, complete with sound effects, soul horns and Ms. Puthli alternately breathy and giggling\\".Jon Pareles, \\"Asha Puthli, an Indian Singer Who Embraces Countless Cultures\\", The New York Times, 12 August 2006 (retrieved 18 January 2015).

Speaking to Pareles in 2006, Puthli explained that she had viewed Harrison's reading of \\"I Dig Love\\" as a \\"spiritual song\\", adding: \\"They did it like a bhajan, an Indian religious song. In 1973, when I did it, I felt I was already Indian, and the spirituality was inside me. I was trying to become Western, so I brought out the material aspect, the sexual aspect.\\" In 2005, Puthli's recording was sampled by British rapper Kano on his track \\"Reload It\\".Credits, Kano Home Sweet Home CD (679 Recordings, 2005; produced by Kano; art design by Ben Sansbury).

Harrison began writing the song in 1966 while still a member of the Beatles and during a period when he had first become enamoured with Hindu- aligned spirituality. The subject matter is reincarnation and the need to avoid rebirth, by limiting actions and thoughts that lead to one's soul returning in another, earthbound life form. Harrison recorded \\"Art of Dying\\" in London shortly after the Beatles' break-up in April 1970. The song was co- produced by Phil Spector and features a hard rock arrangement. The backing musicians include Eric Clapton and the rest of the latter's short-lived band Derek and the Dominos, as well as Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Bobby Keys and Jim Price. The song has received praise from several music critics; among these, James Hunter of Rolling Stone described it as a \\"spookily proto-disco\\" performance by \\"a rock orchestra recorded with sensitivity and teeth and faraway mikes\\". Since Harrison's death in November 2001, the lyrics have received further recognition as a comment on the nature of human existence. The song has been interpreted in the jazz style by American guitarist Joel Harrison and as a grunge piece by the band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. Background and composition For the last 30 or more years of his life, George Harrison repeatedly identified his first experience of taking the hallucinogenic drug LSD, with John Lennon and their wives, as being responsible for his interest in spirituality and Hinduism.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 144, 145.George Harrison, in The Beatles, pp. 179–80.George Harrison, pp. 36, 44, 106.Olivia Harrison, p. 190. The \\"trip\\" occurred by accident in February 1965,George Harrison, p. 41.George Harrison and John Lennon, in The Beatles, p. 177.Lennon, p. 241. and he later recalled a thought coming to his mind during the experience: \\"'Yogis of the Himalayas.' I don't know why ... It was like somebody was whispering to me: 'Yogis of the Himalayas.'\\" A visit in August 1967 to the epicentre of hippie counterculturalism, San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, then persuaded him to abandon LSD and pursue a spiritual path through meditation.Clayson, p. 223.Tillery, pp. 53–54, 160. By that point, Harrison had already immersed himself in Indian classical music, which is irrevocably tied to spirituality,Leng, pp. 24, 29.Mick Gold, \\"The Act You've Known For All These Years: The Beatles and Sgt. Pepper\\", unpublished, 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). and dealt with what author Ian MacDonald terms \\"the spiritual aridity of modern life\\"MacDonald, p. 215. in his song \\"Within You Without You\\" (on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).MacDonald, p. 15.Leng, pp. 29, 98. Harrison began writing \\"Art of Dying\\" in 1966. Citing comments made by Harrison in a 1969 interview, musicologist Walter Everett says that Harrison possibly drew inspiration from Timothy Leary's text in the book The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead.Everett, p. 323. The song is dedicated to the Hindu concept of reincarnation and the inevitability of death, as outlined in the opening verse:Leng, p. 98. According to author Alan Clayson, the song's title and subject matter suggest a familiarity with the fifteenth-century Latin text Ars Moriendi.Clayson, p. 215. The mention of \\"Sister Mary\\" refers to the Catholic faith in which Harrison had been brought up as a child.Leng, p. 95. Speaking to author Peter Doggett, Harrison's sister Louise qualified his embracing of Hinduism with regard to his upbringing: \\"Our family were Catholics, but we always had a global outlook. We were spiritual, not religious as such. George didn't change as a person after he went to India [in 1966] …\\"Doggett, p. 22. Rather than Sister Mary, Harrison's original lyric named \\"Mr Epstein\\" – the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein.George Harrison, p. 182. Author Bruce Spizer speculates that Harrison was \\"contemplating life after the Beatles\\" as early as mid 1966, since \\"most of the song's original verses recognise that even Mr. Epstein won't be able to keep the group together or help out when it's over ...\\" atman) repeatedly takes on a physical body, until moksha. The concept forms the basis of Harrison's lyrics in \\"Art of Dying\\". Harrison says in his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, that in most cases one's soul does not in fact \\"leave here\\" after death, due to the karmic debt, or \\"load\\", accrued through actions and thoughts carried out in one's lifetime.George Harrison, pp. 180–81. This point is illustrated in the third verse of \\"Art of Dying\\":Tillery, p. 89. The mention of \\"a million years of crying\\" is a reference to the endless cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation, where the soul repeatedly fails to leave the material world and attain nirvana,O'Dell, p. 141. otherwise known as moksha.Allison, p. 87. Written in a period shortly before \\"karma\\", \\"mantra\\", \\"guru\\" and \\"māyā\\" all became key words in his vocabulary,Clayson, pp. 208, 217–18, 293, 295. Harrison shows an acknowledgment of possible confusion on the part of his listeners, and a degree of humour, with the questions that appear at the end of the verses, \\"Are you still with me?\\" and \\"Do you believe me?\\" The subject of rebirth was one he would return to frequently throughout his solo career, notably on \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\", with its pleas \\"Keep me free from birth\\" and \\"Help me cope with this heavy load\\".Schaffner, p. 159.Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 26 June 2012). Recording \\"Art of Dying\\" was one of many compositions that Harrison stockpiled during the Beatles' careerMadinger & Easter, p. 427.Unterberger, p. 286. due to the continued dominance of the band's principal songwriters, Lennon and Paul McCartney. When discussing his plans for making a solo album in an October 1969 interview, Harrison referred to \\"Art of Dying\\", saying he had been \\"working on a song about reincarnation since 1966\\".Harry, p. 10. On 26 May 1970, a month after the Beatles' break-up, it was one of at least fifteen songs performed by Harrison for producer Phil Spector's benefit at Abbey Road Studios in London,Badman, p. 10. with a view to narrowing down the material under consideration for All Things Must Pass.Leng, p. 77. Harrison performed the song on acoustic guitar, but as with \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", \\"Run of the Mill\\", \\"Let It Down\\" and other selections, its arrangement was transformed significantly as the album sessions progressed.Spizer, p. 225. In the case of \\"Art of Dying\\", Spector gave the track a heavy production for the official release;Harry, p. 21. authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe the production as a \\"[big] 'kitchen sink' job\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 432. A widely bootlegged version known as \\"Art of Dying (Take 9)\\", comprising a band performance dominated by acoustic rhythm guitars and piano,Unterberger, p. 290. with Ringo Starr on drums, sees the song somewhere midway between the solo run-through and the All Things Must Pass arrangement. This take 9, played in the key of B minor, a semitone up from that of the official version of the song, was still in contention for release during the album's mixing phase. Derek and the Dominos' Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock and Eric Clapton, pictured in 1970 In a chapter discussing All Things Must Pass in his 2010 autobiography, American musician Bobby Whitlock writes of recording the song: \\"It was awesome when we were doing 'The Art of Dying,' Eric [Clapton] on that wah-wah and it was all cooking, Derek and the Dominos with George Harrison.\\"Whitlock, p. 75. The sessions led to the formation of Derek and the Dominos,Rodriguez, p. 77.Leng, p. 101. whose four members – Clapton, Whitlock, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon – all played on the track.Spizer, pp. 220, 225. In a 1990 interview, Clapton said, \\"We made our bones, really, on that album with George\\", since the four musicians had no formal plans to work as a band beforehand.Timothy White, \\"Rollin' & Tumblin'\\", Spin, March 1990, p. 36. The released version of \\"Art of Dying\\" is in the hard rock style. The track begins with what author Elliot Huntley terms Clapton's \\"firecracking\\" lead guitar,Huntley, p. 59. and is propelled by Gordon's drumming and Radle's urgent bass. Jim Price's horn arrangement provides a countermelody to the various A minor voicings in the song's instrumental passagesLeng, p. 97. through to its \\"galloping\\" ending. Testifying to the ferocity of the performance, Phil Collins later recalled that his hands were so badly blistered during the run-throughs of the song, he was unable to play his congas with any force once they came to actually record it,Will Hodgkinson, \\"Home Entertainment: Phil Collins\\", The Guardian, 15 November 2002 (retrieved 8 May 2019). hence the apparent absence of congas in the final mix.John Harris, \\"A Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, July 2001, p. 72. Another percussion part – maracas – does feature prominently, and may have been played by Mal Evans, Starr, members of Badfinger or Maurice Gibb, all of whom attended the session also, according to Collins. Although Harrison acknowledged Collins' contribution on the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass, Collins writes in his 2016 autobiography that this credit was merely out of kindness, and that he did not in fact play on the released version of \\"Art of Dying\\".Collins, pp. 69, 75. In Collins' recollection, the session he attended for the song was an earlier take from May 1970, featuring a different musical arrangement and with Starr, Klaus Voormann and Billy Preston as the other musicians.Collins, pp. 63, 66, 69–70. Before giving Collins the mistaken credit in 2001, Harrison sent him a tape that he said was a recording of the song with his conga playing. Collins recalled in a 2016 interview, \\"I thought, Oh, my god, this sounds terrible.\\" Collins added that the tape was a practical joke at his expense, since Harrison had asked percussionist Ray Cooper to deliberately play poorly, saying: \\"Play bad, I'm going to record it and send it to Phil.\\"Jordan Runtagh, \\"10 Things You Didn't Know George Harrison Did\\", Rolling Stone, 29 November 2016 (retrieved 8 May 2019). Release Apple Records released All Things Must Pass on 27 November 1970,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. with \\"Art of Dying\\" sequenced as the second track on side four, in the triple album's original, LP format.Spizer, pp. 219–20. While describing the positive response to the album, author Robert Rodriguez includes the song as an illustration of how Harrison's talent had been \\"hidden in plain sight\\" behind Lennon and McCartney during the Beatles' career.Rodriguez, p. 147. Rodriguez writes: \\"That the Quiet Beatle was capable of such range – from the joyful 'What Is Life' to the meditative 'Isn't It a Pity' to the steamrolling 'Art of Dying' to the playful 'I Dig Love' – was revelatory.\\" On 10 December, a portion of the song was included in a segment on the UK television show Top of the Pops that focused on All Things Must Pass.Badman, pp. 16–17. The album's release coincided with a period when religion and spirituality had become a popular theme in rock music.Clayson, p. 294.Frontani, p. 158. \\"Art of Dying\\" exemplified Harrison's focus on Hindu-aligned religious concepts as a solo artist from 1970 onwards, a theme that informed director Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary film George Harrison: Living in the Material World.Steve Rabey/Religion News Service, \\"George Harrison, 'Living In The Material World', The Huffington Post, 9 October 2011 (retrieved 25 February 2017). On the Hare Krishna Tribute to George Harrison DVD, in which devotees from the Radha Krishna Temple (London) offered their reminiscences on Harrison,Harry, p. 217. Shyamsundar Das, a lifelong devotee, expressed his certainty that Harrison had achieved a state of transcendence in line with Hindu teachings. Shyamsundar quoted from the lyrics to \\"Art of Dying\\" while remarking that Harrison had successfully grasped the principals of moksha even by the late 1960s.\\"The Art of Dying\\", Hare Krishna Tribute to George Harrison DVD (ITV Productions, 2002). In his article on Scorsese's film, Joe Bosso of Music Radar says that \\"mastering the art of dying\\" had been Harrison's prime concern during the final years of his life, and he cites Olivia Harrison's and Starr's respective comments as indicating that Harrison achieved his spiritual goal.Joe Bosso, \\"George Harrison: Living In The Material World – review\\", MusicRadar, 2 October 2011 (retrieved 8 May 2019). Harrison's son Dhani supported this contention in a 2002 interview, and he said that his father had found a contentment and lightheartedness that contrasted with the \\"more serious\\" outlook evident in \\"Art of Dying\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\".Greene, pp. 272–73. That same year, music journalist Mikal Gilmore concluded his article on Harrison for Rolling Stone magazine with a comment on the relevance of \\"Art of Dying\\" to Harrison's legacy. He said the song reflects Harrison's recognition that manifesting love is \\"among the highest purposes of life\\" as well as an appreciation that \\"Sometime darkness is irrefutable, and sometimes love and understanding can't save a troubled heart or a soul in harm's way.\\" Gilmore added that the \\"love story\\" surrounding the Beatles best illustrated such a \\"dichotomy\\" and none of the Beatles \\"carried that knowledge with greater weight, yearning or honor than George Harrison\\".The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 51. In January 1991, Starr contributed a preface to the book Walking After Midnight in which he reproduced Harrison's I, Me, Mine entry on the song.Badman, p. 459. The book followed the 1988 documentary film Walking After Midnight, in which well-known figures such as Starr, Martin Sheen, Willie Nelson, Donovan and the Dalai Lama speculate on their past incarnations.Dan Pavlides, \\"Walking After Midnight (1988)\\", AllMovie (retrieved 18 April 2018). Critical reception In his contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Ben Gerson wrote of the wide range of styles found on All Things Must Pass and recognised \\"Art of Dying\\" as \\"a song of reincarnation\\" with a melody that he likened to \\"Paint It Black\\" by the Rolling Stones.Ben Gerson, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass\\", Rolling Stone, 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 3 July 2012). Village Voice contributor Nicholas Schaffner and others have described it as an \\"essay\\" on the subject of reincarnation.Schaffner, p. 142. While reviewing the 30th anniversary edition of the album, James Hunter of Rolling Stone enthused about the performance: \\"Imagine a rock orchestra recorded with sensitivity and teeth and faraway mikes: bluesy and intricate on Harrison and Dylan's 'I'd Have You Anytime,' fizzy on 'Apple Scruffs,' grooving on 'Let It Down,' and spookily proto-disco on 'Art of Dying.'\\"James Hunter, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass 30th Anniversary reissue\\", Rolling Stone, 29 March 2001; quoted in The Super Seventies \\"Classic 500\\", George Harrison – All Things Must Pass (retrieved 4 June 2014). In another 2001 review, for The New York Times, Jody Rosen grouped \\"Art of Dying\\" with \\"Wah-Wah\\" and \\"Hear Me Lord\\" as examples of how Spector successfully transformed Harrison's compositions on an \\"operatic scale\\". Rosen added: \\"The symphonic squall of these songs seems less about rock star hubris than Mr. Harrison's straining to express outsized emotions – sorrow, regret, longing, writ very large.\\"Jody Rosen, \\"Luxuriating in the Sprawl of That Early 70's Sound\\", The New York Times, 29 July 2001, p. 2 (retrieved 25 February 2017). In his feature on Harrison's solo career for Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson paired \\"Art of Dying\\" with \\"Beware of Darkness\\" as songs that \\"rate among the finest compositions of Harrison's entire career\\".Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 17. Writing for Uncut in 2008, David Cavanagh said that, while \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was the best-known of the spiritually themed songs on All Things Must Pass, \\"Art of Dying\\" was the most \\"far-sighted\\", with a lyric that \\"saw the 27-year-old Harrison prepare for death in an ecstasy of resolved, purified karma\\".David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, p. 40. Writing in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Andrew Gilbert highlights \\"Art of Dying\\" as an example of the \\"finely crafted, spiritually charged songs\\" that ensure that All Things Must Pass \\"only sounds better with time\\".Album review by Andrew Gilbert, in Robert Dimery, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Universe (New York, NY, 2005); quoted in The Super Seventies \\"Classic 500\\", George Harrison – All Things Must Pass (retrieved 4 June 2014). Damian Fanelli of Guitar World includes the song among the highlights of Clapton's many collaborations with members of the Beatles. He describes it as \\"outstanding\\" and \\"wah-tastic ... the closest Harrison got to hard rock as a solo artist\\".Damian Fanelli, \\"Exploring Eric Clapton's Collaborations with The Beatles, Part 1\\", guitarworld.com, 8 November 2016 (retrieved 7 May 2019). Among Harrison biographers, Elliot Huntley describes the song as \\"certainly the most dramatic\\" track on the album and \\"one of the most scintillating rock songs in the Harrison canon\\". Ian Inglis writes that \\"Art of Dying\\" fully reflects Harrison's \\"post-Beatles confidence\\" and notes the Middle Eastern \\"musical antecedents\\" despite the obvious Hindu concepts within the lyrics.Inglis, p. 31. In his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Simon Leng views \\"Art of Dying\\" as picking up \\"where 'Tomorrow Never Knows' and 'Within You Without You' paused\\", and adds: \\"If ever a song challenged the one-eyed nature of the rock world, this is it. Nothing could be further from superficial pop culture.\\" Other versions Harrison never performed \\"Art of Dying\\" live,Madinger & Easter, pp. 436–37, 447, 473, 481, 485. although he included it in his proposed setlist for the Concert for Bangladesh,Olivia Harrison, p. 288. which took place at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971.Frontani, pp. 158–59. Jim Horn's horn chart for the song is reproduced at the end of I, Me, Mine.George Harrison, p. 399.

In a subsequent interview, Dhani highlighted this version as one of the George Fest performances that had particularly impressed him, saying: \\"I didn't realize that was like grunge until I saw BRMC play it; I was like, 'Oh. This is a shoegazey grunge song!' They unlocked that song for me.\\"NPR staff, \\"The Quiet Beatle's Long Shadow: Dhani Harrison On Sharing His Dad With The World\\", npr.org, 28 February 2016 (retrieved 26 February 2017). Megan Volpert of PopMatters similarly considers it to be one of the concert's two \\"particularly great, more interpretive covers\\". She highlights the use of slide guitar as a \\"bold\\" new feature, given the reverence afforded Harrison's slide playing.Megan Volpert, \\"Various Artists: George Fest\\", PopMatters, 29 March 2016 (retrieved 3 March 2017). In his review for American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz also considers BRMC's performance to be among the best at George Fest and he describes the song as a \\"seldom heard Harrison gem\\".Hal Horowitz, \\"Various Artists: George Fest: A Night to Celebrate the Music of George Harrison-CD/DVD\\", American Songwriter, 26 February 2016 (retrieved 8 May 2019).

It was the last track on side four of the original LP format and is generally viewed as the closing song on the album, disc three being the largely instrumental Apple Jam. Harrison wrote \\"Hear Me Lord\\" in January 1969 while still a member of the Beatles. The band rehearsed it briefly at Twickenham Film Studios that month, but it was passed over for inclusion on what became their final album, Let It Be. The song is in the gospel-rock musical style and the lyrics take the form of a personal prayer, in which Harrison seeks help and forgiveness from his deity. Along with \\"My Sweet Lord\\", it is among the most overtly religious selections on All Things Must Pass. The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector and includes musical contributions from Eric Clapton, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Bobby Whitlock and other musicians from Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band. On release, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described \\"Hear Me Lord\\" as the album's \\"big statement\\" and a \\"majestic plea\\". Harrison included the song in his set list for the Concert for Bangladesh on 1 August 1971. He performed it during the afternoon show only, although the recording has never been issued officially. Background and composition George Harrison wrote \\"Hear Me Lord\\" over the weekend of 4–5 January 1969, soon after the Beatles had begun the rehearsals for a proposed television special at Twickenham Film Studios. With the band members in disagreement about the nature of the project and whether to return to live performance, this period was one of discord within the group.Miles, pp. 327–28. For Harrison, it contrasted sharply with the two months he had spent in the United States at the end of 1968,Huntley, pp. 17–19. when he had enjoyed collaborating with musicians such as Jackie Lomax, members of the Los Angeles Wrecking Crew, Tiny Tim,Clayson, pp. 259–60.

In addition, his wife, Pattie Boyd, had temporarily left him that same weekend, after discovering that Harrison was having an affair with a French woman they had invited to stay at their home.Doggett, p. 58.Tillery, p. 68. Although the song is recognised as a deeply personal statement, \\"Hear Me Lord\\" is one of the compositions that Harrison does not mention at all in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine.Leng, p. 99.Spizer, p. 225. Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes the self-revelation evident in its lyrics as \\"unprecedented\\", adding: \\"How many millionaire rock stars use a song to beg forgiveness from God, or anyone else ...?\\" Leng identifies three \\"anchors\\" in the song's lyrics: the phrases \\"forgive me\\", \\"help me\\" and \\"hear me\\". In their pleas for forgiveness, acknowledgement of weakness and promise of self-improvement, Harrison's words have been described by author Ian Inglis as offering a similar statement to the Christian Lord's Prayer.Inglis, p. 31. Inglis highlights the song's final verse – particularly the lines \\"Help me Lord, please / To burn out this desire\\" – as being an \\"almost flagellatory ... self- chastisement\\" on Harrison's part. Religious academic Joshua Greene recognises the same couplet as an example of Harrison the \\"life-lover\\", prone to \\"sexual fantasies\\", and just one facet of its parent album's \\"intimately detailed account of a spiritual journey\\".Greene, p. 181. The Beatles' Get Back sessions On 6 January 1969, the third day of the Beatles' filmed rehearsals at Twickenham,Winn, p. 237. Harrison presented the song to his bandmates, announcing that he had written it over the weekend.Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 55. Like \\"Let It Down\\", \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and other compositions of his around this time,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 38, 187. it was met with little enthusiasm from the group's principal songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney.Huntley, pp. 18–19, 21.Martin O'Gorman, \\"Film on Four\\", Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles' Final Years – Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970), Emap (London, 2003), p. 73. The band barely rehearsed \\"Hear Me Lord\\" that day,Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 75. during which Harrison and McCartney engaged in an on-camera argument culminating in Harrison's resigned comment \\"Whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it.\\"Miles, p. 328.Winn, p. 244. Even after the location had been moved to the Apple basement later that month and keyboard player Billy Preston brought in – two developments Harrison instigated in an attempt to improve the atmosphereClayson, p. 262.Miles, p. 331. – he would not play the song again at any Beatles session. Harrison found a more sympathetic collaborator in Preston, a born-again Christian,Clayson, p. 280. when he began producing the Texan's debut album on Apple Records in February 1969.\\"Billy Preston Encouraging Words\\", Apple Records (retrieved 5 August 2012). The two musicians co-wrote the track \\"Sing One for the Lord\\",Leng, p. 71. one of the first songs Preston recorded for Apple, although it would not be released until September 1970, on his Encouraging Words album.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 91. Recording At Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970,Madinger & Easter, p. 426. a month after the Beatles' break-up, Harrison ran through \\"Hear Me Lord\\" alone on electric guitar for producer Phil Spector.Unterberger, p. 286.Spizer, pp. 220, 225. Leng suggests that, following Lennon and McCartney's routine dismissal of many of his compositions, Harrison \\"presented his new songs with reticence, almost with a Pavlovian expectation of their being rejected\\".Leng, p. 76. In his interview for the 2011 George Harrison: Living in the Material World documentary, Spector explains his positive reaction to Harrison's spiritually themed songs: \\"He just lived by his deeds. He was spiritual and you knew it, and there was no salesmanship involved. It made you spiritual being around him.\\"Phil Spector interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD (Village Roadshow, 2011; directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese). This solo performance of \\"Hear Me Lord\\" was subsequently made available on the bootleg album Beware of ABKCO!Richie Unterberger, \\"George Harrison Beware of ABKCO!\\", AllMusic (retrieved 27 July 2018). Selected for inclusion on All Things Must Pass,Badman, p. 10. the band performance of \\"Hear Me Lord\\" has been described by Leng as \\"slow-cooking, gospel rock\\". The musicians on the recording were all those with whom Harrison had briefly toured Europe in December 1969, as a member of Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band,Clayson, pp. 277–78, 288.John Harris, \\"A Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, July 2001, pp. 70, 72. including Preston and Eric Clapton, supplemented by pianist Gary Wright, a mainstay of the extended sessions for All Things Must Pass.Leng, pp. 82, 99. The track begins with Jim Gordon's heavily treated drums and features a \\"rolling\\" piano commentary from Wright and \\"sweet slide guitar licks\\" from Harrison, Leng writes. Author Bruce Spizer remarks on the \\"soulful\\" backing-vocal arrangement performed by Harrison, multi-tracked and credited to the George O'Hara-Smith Singers. The guitar interplay between Harrison and Clapton, notably what Leng terms the track's \\"'Little Wing' riffs\\", would be reprised on \\"Back in My Life Again\\" and \\"A Day Without Jesus\\" for organ player Bobby Whitlock's eponymous solo album, which was recorded in January 1971.Leng, p. 123. In their Solo Beatles Compendium, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter comment that the official take of \\"Hear Me Lord\\" ran considerably longer than the released 5:46 running time.Madinger & Easter, p. 432. On the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass, the song's length was extended to 6:01.Booklet accompanying All Things Must Pass reissue (Gnome Records, 2001; produced by George Harrison & Phil Spector). Release \\"Hear Me Lord\\" was released on 27 November 1970Badman, p. 16. as the last track on disc two of All Things Must Pass.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. It was effectively the final song on the album, since the third LP, titled Apple Jam, was a bonus disc consisting almost entirely of instrumental jams recorded during the sessions.Clayson, p. 292.Spizer, pp. 225–26. Discussing the critical and commercial success of Harrison's triple album, author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977: \\"George painted his masterpiece at a time when both he and his audience still believed music could change the world. If Lennon's studio was his soap-box, then Harrison's was his pulpit.\\"Schaffner, p. 142. The release coincided with a period when the counterculture's interest in spirituality, at the expense of formal religion, received heavy coverage both in the mainstream press and from religious commentators.Frontani, p. 158. Reflecting the intentions behind songs such as \\"Hear Me Lord\\" and the album's worldwide number 1 hit single, \\"My Sweet Lord\\",Rodriguez, pp. 148, 254. Harrison said in an interview at the time: \\"Music should be used for the perception of God, not jitterbugging.\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 40. He added: \\"I want to be God-conscious. That's really my only ambition, and everything else in life is incidental.\\"Greene, p. 184. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow includes \\"Hear Me Lord\\" among the songs that provided \\"added vindication\\" for Harrison, after All Things Must Pass saw him become \\"by far the most successful\\" former Beatle by the Christmas of 1970.Snow, p. 25. Critical reception In his album review for the NME, Alan Smith described \\"Hear Me Lord\\" as an \\"impassioned hymn\\"Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles – The Solo Years 1970–1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 32. and a \\"stand-out number within the whole set\\".Alan Smith, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\", NME, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 19 May 2013). To Rolling Stones Ben Gerson, having bemoaned that \\"[Harrison's] words sometimes try too hard; [as if] he's taking himself or the subject too seriously\\", \\"Hear Me Lord\\" was \\"the big statement\\". \\"Here George stops preaching,\\" Gerson continued, \\"and, speaking only to a God, delivers a simple, but majestic plea: 'Help me Lord please / To rise a little higher ...'\\"Ben Gerson, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass\\", Rolling Stone, 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 19 May 2013). Reviewers in the 21st century have deemed the song a perfect album closer,Huntley, p. 60.Rodriguez, p. 156. a point to which Madinger and Easter add: \\"If the Lord hadn't heard him by now, then there wasn't much else [Harrison] could do to get his ear.\\" Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley praises \\"Hear Me Lord\\" as \\"another soulful hymn ... another number given the full gospel treatment by Spector\\" and credits Harrison with being \\"the first white man to combine gospel and rock without sounding ludicrous\\". Writing in Rolling Stone Press's Harrison tribute, following the singer's death in November 2001, Greg Kot described the music as \\"orchestrated into a dense, echo-laden cathedral of rock in excelsis by Phil Spector\\" before noting: \\"But the real stars of this monumental effort are Harrison's songs, which give awe-inspiring dimension to his spirituality and sobering depth to his yearning for a love that doesn't lie.\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 187. Music critic Richie Unterberger describes the song as \\"a lovely, somber number\\" when first performed by Harrison at Twickenham in January 1969. He adds that the Beatles' disinterest in the song was most likely due to its unsuitability to the band's style, whereas \\"it truly found its appropriate setting\\" on All Things Must Pass.Unterberger, p. 238. In his 2001 review for The New York Times, Jody Rosen grouped \\"Hear Me Lord\\" with \\"Art of Dying\\" and \\"Wah-Wah\\" as examples of how Spector successfully transformed Harrison's compositions on an \\"operatic scale\\". Rosen added: \\"The symphonic squall of these songs seems less about rock star hubris than Mr. Harrison's straining to express outsized emotions – sorrow, regret, longing, writ very large.\\"Jody Rosen, \\"Luxuriating in the Sprawl of That Early 70's Sound\\", The New York Times, 29 July 2001 (archived version retrieved 26 July 2018). Simon Leng says that the lyrics alone might make \\"Hear Me Lord\\" seem \\"falsely pious\\" yet, like Bruce Spizer, he recognises Harrison's sincerity reflected in his performance on the recording. Leng adds: \\"Even more than 'My Sweet Lord', the closer to the album proper is the most emotionally compelling piece on an emotionally naked compilation. This is a true outpouring of feeling ... A movingly impassioned vocal completes a picture that is as cathartic as anything on Lennon's Plastic Ono Band album.\\" Less convinced, Ian Inglis says that \\"the impression is of a man cowed, rather than liberated, by his faith.\\" Inglis finds an \\"uneasy self-righteousness\\" in Harrison's verse-one lines \\"Forgive them Lord / Those that feel they can't afford you\\" and concludes: \\"The song's gospel-tinged backing matches the evangelical nature of its sentiments, but ['Hear Me Lord'] is a slightly unsettling end to a collection of songs of great power and passion.\\"Inglis, pp. 31–32. Davy Knowles & Back Door Slam covered the song on their 2009 album Coming Up for Air,Ryan Dembinsky, \\"Davy Knowles & BDS: Breathing Deep\\", JamBase, 11 August 2009 (archived version retrieved 26 July 2018). produced by Peter Frampton,Alex Young, \\"Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam Coming Up For Air\\", Consequence of Sound, 5 May 2009 (retrieved 26 July 2018). who was one of several uncredited contributors to All Things Must Pass.Leng, p. 78. In his review for Blogcritics, Josh Hathaway described the song as a \\"Harrison classic\\" and the album's \\"masterpiece\\" thanks to Frampton's lead guitar duel with Knowles and Benmont Tench's sympathetic organ playing.Josh Hathaway, \\"Music Review: Davy Knowles & Back Door Slam – Coming Up For Air\\", Blogcritics, 21 June 2009 (retrieved 26 July 2018). Live performance \\"Hear Me Lord\\" was included in Harrison's proposed setlist for the Concert for BangladeshHarrison, p. 288. when rehearsals got under way at Nola Studios, New York City, in the last week of July 1971.Badman, p. 43. Harrison then performed it during the afternoon show at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, 1 August, immediately following Bob Dylan's surprise set.Schaffner, p. 146. After what author Alan Clayson describes as a \\"creaky\\" performance of the song,Clayson, pp. 312–13. a slight reorganisation of the concert program saw it dropped for the second show. Along with Dylan's \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\", \\"Hear Me Lord\\" was the only song performed at the Concert for Bangladesh that did not appear on the official live album of the event and in Saul Swimmer's 1972 concert film.Madinger & Easter, p. 437. Following Harrison's death in November 2001, Chris Carter, an American DJ and a consultant to Capitol Records, spoke of including \\"Hear Me Lord\\" on a planned reissue of The Concert for Bangladesh, which was scheduled for release during 2002.Charles Shaar Murray, \\"George Harrison et al: Concert for Bangla Desh\\", Mojo, March 2002; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).

Pantomime in America, as in England, is usually performed at Christmas time. The entertainments, aimed at families, are based on nursery stories and fairy tales, and they incorporate songs (traditional, popular and new), slapstick comedy, often topical jokes, magic, some cross-dressing, local references, audience participation, and mild adult innuendo. Earlier productions often also included a harlequinade.

Nine years of boyhood (1858–67) were spent with his parents at Brooklyn in the United States. Leaving school there at an early age, he was employed by a New York publisher.

He graduated B.A. with honours in philosophy at London University in 1873, and proceeded M.A. in 1874, when he left Cheshunt and was ordained to the ministry of the Countess of Huntingdon's connexion. He began ministerial work at Bishop's Stortford, also acting as assistant master at the school there. Dam Square, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Pictures from Holland 1887) by Richard Lovett In 1876 Lovett accepted an independent charge as minister of the Countess of Huntingdon church at Rochdale. In 1882 he changed direction, and was appointed book editor of the Religious Tract Society. He then became a director of the London Missionary Society. Interest in missionary work brought him into close touch with James Chalmers (New Guinea) and James Gilmour (Mongolia), both of whose lives he wrote. He revisited the United States as a delegate to the ecumenical missionary conference of 1900. Lovett formed for himself a collection of early English Bibles and kindred works, which was dispersed after his death. In 1899, on the retirement of Samuel Gosnell Green, Lovett became one of the secretaries of the Religious Tract Society, charged with the Society's continental interests, while retaining much of his former work as book editor. Towards the end of his life the affairs of Cheshunt College, of which he acted as honorary secretary, troubled him, and he was among the early workers for the reconstitution of the Congregational Union. Lovett died suddenly of heart failure at Clapham, London, on 29 December 1904. Works Lovett was a prolific author, particularly in periodicals. His main books were: *Norwegian Pictures (1885); *Pictures from Holland (1887); *Irish Pictures (1888); *London Pictures (1890); *United States Pictures (1891); *James Gilmour of Mongolia (1892); *The Printed English Bible (1895); *The History of the London Missionary Society (1899), for the LMS centenary; *The English Bible in the John Rylands Library (1899); *James Chalmers (1902); and *Tamate: the Life of James Chalmers for Boys (1903). Family He married on 29 April 1879 Annie Hancock, daughter of William Reynolds of Torquay, who, with one son and two daughters, survived him.

Power (1905-1993) was a pioneering entrepreneur in the use of microfilm for the reproduction of scholarly publications. During World War II, Power directed the microfilming of thousands of rare books and other printed materials in British libraries. Power paid the library a minimal fee per exposure and then took the film to the United States where he sold copies to American libraries. The idea was both a clever business arrangement and a benefit to American scholars, who lacked access to European library collections. It was also an inventive form of preservation in light of wartime threats to libraries. Queen Elizabeth knighted Power in the 1970s for this preservation work.Eugene Power, Edition of One. Ann Arbor, MI: University Microfilms Inc., 1990, Appendix H. In 1938, Power founded University Microfilms International, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is widely credited with having invented \\"micropublishing.\\"Alan M.

The company also pioneered a business model for publishing limited-interest doctoral dissertations, becoming the publisher of record for all U.S. dissertations in 1951. University Microfilms was acquired by the Xerox Corporation in 1962 for $8 million. Power continued to work for Xerox until his mandatory retirement in 1970 at the age of 65.Eugene Power, Edition of One. Ann Arbor, MI: University Microfilms Inc., 1990, p. 318. In 1967 Mr. Power created the Power Foundation for philanthropy.

The film is actor Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut. Plot The plot takes place in Beecham House, a retirement home for former professional musicians, patterned after the real-life Casa di Riposo per Musicisti founded by Giuseppe Verdi. Reg, Wilf and Cissy are retired opera singers who often worked together in the past; among other residents are Cedric Livingstone, a former director, and diva Anne Langley. All the guests in the retirement home are suffering in varying degree the ailments old age can bring but continue to be engaged in their former professions in one way or another, including lecturing and introducing young people to music. Finances threaten closure of the home, but proceeds from a yearly gala concert on Verdi's birthday hold hope for a continuation of the place. However, Cedric has become rather desperate because some of the most prominent singers have either died or decided not to participate at all. Reg, Wilf and Cissy were in the cast of a very highly rated recording of the opera Rigoletto, which includes a famous quartet for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor and baritone (\\"Bella figlia dell'amore\\"). This version is very prominent among opera buffs as THE Rigoletto of the post-war era. Reg is shocked to find his former wife Jean Horton, the missing soprano of the Rigoletto recording, turning up to live at Beecham House. Reg is angry not to have been warned or consulted as their parting was on very sour terms. At first, Jean tries unsuccessfully to mend things with Reg. In the ensuing conversations her infidelity arises, as well as her past marriages, but Reg comes to understand that all that is now in the past. In the meantime, Cedric has come up with a plan that could work, but has one flaw. He meets with Wilf , Cissy and Reg to put his idea to them. His hope is to convince them to reform the quartet who sang on the famous recording and to sing it again for the Verdi Gala concert, hoping it will sell enough tickets to save the home. Reg is sceptical but agrees having overcome his issues and problems with Jean living at the home and being in such close proximity daily. Wilf persuades the Dr in charge to allow them a night out, resulting in Reg, Wilf and Cissy inviting Jean to dinner. Blissfuly unaware and thinking friendships mended and repaired, with the past forgotten, Jean accepts the invitation, however, she is harder to persuade as she vowed never to sing again after retiring, resulting in Jean getting angry and storming out of the restaurant. The following morning, Cissy takes Jean flowers from the garden to cheer her up, and asks if she wishes to discuss the quartet, but Jean doesn't want to taking the flowers and beating Cissy with them which only aggravates Cissy's already delicate senile condition. Jean apologises and is finally persuaded to sing in the quartet from Rigoletto, after learning that Anne Langley will be singing \\"Vissi d'arte\\" from Tosca as a finale, unless the four of them sing together, in which case they will be given pride of place as the last to perform. The group prepares for their performance and, moments before their curtain call, Cissy gets very confused and attempts to walk out the door, saying that she has to go back to her family, but Jean manages to salvage the situation. During her conversation with Cissy, Jean expresses regret for all her past bad behaviour towards Reg and admits that she is still in love with him. Reg overhears this. Just as the recital is about to start, the director of the home is amazed at the energy displayed by the guests of the home. The idea of rehearsing and playing before an audience has brought life back to the home and the quartet. Prior to going on stage, Reg asks Jean to marry him again. As the quartet enter the stage individually, and to the rapturous applause of the audience, Reg stands next to Jean. Jean asks Reg if he was serious, he replies yes. Jean accepts and takes Reg by the hand. Cast Many of the supporting and background cast in the film's \\"retirement home for former professional musicians\\" were portrayed by actual professional musicians, as illustrated by then-and-now photos during the closing credits:Per closing credits Production Headline Pictures' Mark Shivas and Stewart Mackinnon acquired the film rights to the play from Ronald Harwood, and, with funding from BBC Films, commissioned him to write the screenplay. Mackinnon then approached a number of co-producers and directors, and eventually contracted the producer Finola Dwyer and director Dustin Hoffman. Mark Shivas died four years before the film was completed. Quartet is set at Beecham House, a retirement home for musicians. Hedsor House in Buckinghamshire was used as the location of Beecham House. Several scenes were filmed at St Nicholas' Church, Hedsor. Dustin Hoffman said Harwood was inspired by the 1984 documentary Tosca's Kiss (about the world's first nursing home for retired opera singers, founded in Milan by composer Giuseppe Verdi in 1896) to write the original play on which the film is based. Release Star Tom Courtenay and director Dustin Hoffman in Paris at the film's French premiere, March 2013 Quartet premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2012, followed by screenings at another dozen film festivals during the autumn of 2012. The film had its first general release in Australia and New Zealand on 26 December 2012, before being released in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2013 and in Ireland three days later. It saw a limited release in the United States on 11 January 2013. Quartet was also screened at Cardiff's Cineworld complex on Thursday, 6 December 2012, in a charity event arranged by the Rotary Club of Blackwood, with proceeds donated to charities. The premiere was attended by the film's producer Finola Dwyer, who gave an interview on the making of the film. Quartet was released on DVD and Blu-ray/DVD/digital on 6 May 2013 in the UK, and on 18 June 2013 in the United States.Quartet, BBC Films Reception Quartet received generally positive reviews from professional film critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating with an average rating of 6.5/10 based on 135 reviews.

It was the first Norwegian Lutheran Church constructed in western Wisconsin. Hauge Log Church is located on County Highway Z just off State Highway 78. The historic building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. A Historic District Park open year round was created by the residents of the Town of Perry in 2001 to surround and protect its scenic views and serenity from development in perpetuity [http://www.haugehistoricdistrictpark.org and http://www.haugehistoricdistrictpark.com. History Outhouse behind the church By 1851 two flavors of Norwegian Lutherans had settled around the area where the Hauge Church would be built: Lutherans loyal to the Norwegian state church, and other Lutherans who preferred the ideas of Hans Nielsen Hauge, a reformer back in Norway who had been jailed by the state church. Neither group had a church building, so these unlikely bedfellows agreed to build one together. Logs for the church were cut and drawn in 1851. Labor was donated by the members, with each man assigned a number of logs to cut and prepare. Construction completed in 1852. The walls are built of oak logs. At first the logs were exposed on the outside, but later they were covered with clapboard. Inside, the logs are coated with a thin plaster. The church is still furnished with the original pews, pulpit, altar rail, and a small balcony. With The church was the first Norwegian Lutheran Church in its area. Adjacent to the church is a small cemetery where members of the first congregation are buried. The state-churchers and the Haugeans shared the building for a bit, but conflict soon arose, becoming hot enough that one group locked the other out of the building. In December 1858 the state-church congregation completed their own structure, now the Perry Lutheran Church in nearby Daleyville, Wisconsin. The Haugean (haugianere) congregation remained in the original log church some 35 years until 1887 when a new larger building was constructed approximately two miles east. In 1927 the church building was restored. The Dane County Wisconsin Historical Society recognized the site for its historical significance, and dedicated a Historic Marker there in 1964. Since 1966, care of Hauge Log Church has been entrusted to the Perry Hauge Log Church Preservation Association, Inc. The 30-acre Hauge Historic Park was established in 2001 by the Town of Perry for the purpose of protecting the Hauge Log Church historic site.http://www.haugehistoricdistrictpark.org The park is open to the public year round seven days a week from sunrise to half hour after sunset.

He was contemporary with his father's former ally, Šamši-Adad V of Assyria, who may have been his brother-in-law, who was possibly married to his (Marduk's) sister Šammu-ramat, the legendary Semiramis, and who was to become his nemesis. Biography He was recorded as a witness on a kudurru dated to his father's 2nd year, 25 years before he ascended the throne, suggesting he was fairly elderly when he assumed power, and he may be a witness on another kudurru,The Sun God tablet BM 91000 published as BBSt 36, vi 24. dated to his grandfather's 31st year, although this individual is identified as the bēl pīḫati, or a \\"provincial administrator,\\" a \\"son\\" of Arad-Ea. The kudurru pictured is a ṣalmu or commemorative granite stele to Adad-eṭir, the dagger- bearer of Marduk, by his eldest son, where the name Marduk-balāssu-iqbi appears in the context of the donor and possibly may not be the king. The fourth line reads \\"the king his lord, Marduk-balāssu-iqbi,\\" leading some to assign it to his reign although it is without a succeeding royal determinative and is followed by mārušu rabū, \\"his eldest son.\\" It is, however, an inscription of this era. He receives a fleeting mention in the Eclectic Chronicle alongside his father.Chronicle 24, tablet BM 27859, r 7. He seems to have made his capital at Gannanāti, a town on the Diyāla River; he engaged in construction activity in Seleucia, and exerted control over territory encompassing both Dēr and Nippur. His officials, like him, seem to have received their positions through inheritance, such as Enlil-apla-uṣur, the šandabakku or governor of Nippur, and the sons of Tuballiṭ-Ešdar, the sukkallus (court personnel) and šākin ṭēmi (a regional governor), suggesting weak central authority and some local autonomy in the provinces. =Šamši- Adad's campaigns= The Nimrud Stele of Šamši-Adad V recording his Annals.The Nimrud Stele, BM 118892, first published as I R 31, iii 70 to iv 45. The Assyrians under, Šamši-Adad V (ca. 823-811 BC), led two successive campaigns against him, the first of which was his fourth since coming to power. The motivation for these assaults is uncertain, however, Šamši-Adad may have harbored some resentment to the inferior position he had been placed into, in a treaty with Marduk-balāssu-iqbi's immediate predecessor, Marduk-zâkir-šumi. The eponym year of Šamaš-ilaya (818/817 BC) records a campaign against \\"[...]šumme.\\" The later eponym years of Inurta-ašared and Šamaš-kumua record campaigns against Chaldea and Babylon respectively, and these are thought to correspond with the second campaign against Marduk-balāssu-iqbi and the subsequent overthrow of his successor, Bāba-aḫa-iddina. There is an intervening eponym year of Bêl-lu-ballat which records \\"campaign against Dēr; Anu the Great went to Dēr\\" (ca. 814/813 BC), which probably best represents this first assault. The campaign route followed the course of the eastern side of the Tigris along the edge of the mountains, as the direct route into Babylonia was blocked by the fortress of Zaddi, the northernmost town in Babylonia at this time, a little way south of the Lesser Zab. According to his Annals,The Nimrud Stele, BM 118892, first published as I R 31, iii 70 to iv 45.Fragmentary copy BM 115020 from Nineveh.Assur Stele, Ass. 6596, published as AfO 9 90–101, iii 1 to iv 10. Šamši-Adad paused to hunt and kill three fierce lions on the slopes of Mount Epih (Jebel Hamrin) and then proceeded to leave a trail of devastation in his wake, besieging the town of Me-Turnat on the bank of the Diyāla, which he then crossed at high water, to take and burn, the royal city of Qarne. He looted Di’bina and then assaulted Gannanāti's suburbs, Datebir and Izduja. He sacked Qiribti-alani, boasting that he had carried away \\"(the inhabitant's) spoil, their property, gods, oxen (and) sheep.\\" Then he despoiled the royal city of Dur-Papsukkal, near Dēr after which he seems to have been successfully countered with a grand alliance of Chaldeans, Elamites, Kassites and Arameans, although the Synchronistic History describes how the Assyrian king \\"filled the plain with the corpses of (Marduk- balāssu-iqbi’s) warriors,\\"Synchronistic History, tablet fragment Sm. 2106 rev. iii 6–9. and his annals record his capture of chariots, cavalry and some of the camp furniture. The second campaign was apparently a more surgical affair, with Šamši-Adad making a bee-line straight for Gannanāti, causing Marduk- balāssu-iqbi to flee to the Diyāla region where he sought refuge initially in Nimitti-šarri (Aḫišānu) but was cornered following the capture of Dēr and led away in chains to Assyria.

Ninurta-Pāqidāt's Dog Bite, also known as The Tale of the Illiterate Doctor in Nippur, note 54. has garnered much academic attention and was first published in 1979 by Antoine Cavigneaux when \\"the text was not properly understood\\", from which it can be inferred he did not understand the joke. A certain Ninurta-Pāqidāt, the brother of Ninurta-ša-kunnâ-irammu and nephew of Enlil-Nippuru-ana-ašrišu-ter (both absurd names), of Nippur was bitten by a dog, the symbol of Gula, the goddess of healing. He sought help from Amel-Baba, a priest from Isin, who, after reciting the appropriate anti- rabies incantation: Ninurta-Pāqidāt must travel to Nippur to collect his fee. On arrival, he encounters Bēltīya-šarrat-Apsî (\\"who tends the garden called Abundance of Enlil and sits [at a] plot on Right Street selling vegetables\\"), the daughter of Ra'im-kini-Marduk, who insists in communicating with him in Sumerian (the language of ancient Nippur many centuries earlier), causing much misunderstanding when he mistakes her for mocking him and is threatened with being driven out of town by an outraged mob of apprentice scribes with their buns (clay practice tablets). Despite the efforts of generations of Assyriologists, such as Erica Reiner (\\"Why do you cuss me?\\"), the punch-line remained elusive, until the Sumerian response, en.nu.dúr.me-en, was translated as \\"O (my) lord, I am a farter,\\" thus identifying the piece as an early exemplar of lavatorial humor.

Whaler and convict transport Speedy was under the command of Captain John Locke in 1791 when she sailed to the South Seas Fisheries. She was reported at the Cape Verde islands in January 1792, Rio de Janeiro in February, and off the coast of Peru in November. She was back in Britain in August 1793.Clayton (2014), p.222. She was mentioned in the Protection Lists in 1793, 1794, and 1796. Captain Thomas Melville sailed in late 1793 to transport stores to Port Jackson and then engage in whaling. However, he was reported to have had to return to Rio de Janeiro in February 1794 to undertake repairs. Melville had been captain on Britannia, also a whaler belonging to Samuel Enderby & Sons, in 1791 when she had been one of 11 ships of the Third Fleet, bound for the Sydney penal settlement. He had seen sperm whales off Van Diemen's Land and Port Jackson, and after delivering the convicts, Britannia had gone whaling; her crew killed the first four whales taken off the coast of Australia. Melville then wrote to his employers about the prospects for whaling in the region.Free Settler or Felon: Convict Ship Britannia 1791, - accessed 9 December 2014. On this second voyage, Melville sailed Speedy to the coast of Chile, where she was reported \\"well\\" in November. She stopped at Rio in January 1796, and arrived back in Britain in October. Between 1797 and 1799, Speedy was under the command of Captain Abraham Bristow, serving in the South Seas Whale Fisheries. At this point she was armed, though with only two 3-pounder guns. She was back in Britain by July 1799. Captain George Quested replaced Bristow later in 1799. Speedy is on the Protection List for 1799. She then sailed from England on 24 November 1799 and arrived at Port Jackson on 15 April 1800.Bateson (1974), pp.139-40. She embarked 53 female convicts, three of whom died on the voyage.Bateson (1974), p.153. Speedy left Port Jackson in July 1800 to whale off New Holland. She returned to London in November 1802 with 150 tons of sperm oil. Subsequent career From 1801 to 1807, Lloyd's Register continues to carry her with \\"Questade\\" as master, S. Enderby as owner, and her trades as a transport operating out of London. She also is no longer armed. Between 1801 and 1804, however, she is listed as Speed, only reverting to the name Speedy in 1805. The Register of Shipping for 1805 shows Speedy with H.

Capture The French captured Speedy after she had disembarked her slaves. Lloyd's List for 27 January 1807 stated that the reports that Speedy, Laten, master, had arrived in the Thames were premature. She had parted from the fleet on 27 December and had not since been heard from.Lloyd's List №4121. Then on 17 February Lloyd's List reported that the privateer Glaneur, of Saint-Malo had captured Speedy, from Antigua to London, and taken her into Île de Ré on 19 January.Lloyd's List №4127. The registers suggest, but do not state, that Speedy returned to her owners' hands. Both carry relatively unchanging information for some years thereafter. Speedy is no longer listed in the Register of Shipping after 1813 and in Lloyd's Register after 1814. However, as the registers often carried stale information, this is a more likely explanation.

In 1923 Dibut played for the Cuban Stars (West) in the Negro National League, one of several white Cubans who played in both Negro league baseball and in the then-segregated major leagues.Riley 2002, pp. 232–233; González Echevarría 1999, p. 176. Dibut was a small man who threw a fastball, a curveball, and \\"about four different changes of pace.\\" Playing career =Early career= In the fall of 1916, Dibut was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers of the minor league American Association. He had been playing in the Cuban Amateur League, where he was the leading pitcher and had gone 10–3, with 118 strikeouts in 123 innings. Later that winter, Dibut joined the Red Sox team in the professional Cuban League under manager Mike González. The 1916/17 season ran from January 29 through February 26, with each team playing 14 games. Dibut pitched in four games with a 1–0 win–loss record.Figueredo 2003, pp. 123–124. In the spring of 1917, Dibut reported to spring training with Milwaukee. According to Sporting Life, he \\"showed well at the start of the season\\", but \\"was started back to his home at Cienfuegos, Cuba\\" in early April. In addition to pitching, he had been tried as an outfielder, but did not have enough experience in that position. The next winter he pitched in the Cuban League for Habana, again under the management of González, and appeared in three games, again going 1–0. With strong performances from Dibut's teammates, José Acosta, Jacinto Calvo, and Merito Acosta, Habana won the championship that season.Figueredo 2003, pp. 125–128. Dibut then returned to the Cuban Amateur League. In 1920 he was the star pitcher for the Cienfuegos Federales that won the Amateur League championship with a record of 19–4.González Echevarría 1999, pp. 210, 212. In 1923, Dibut turned professional again and joined the Cuban Stars (West), a team of Cuban players that competed in the Negro National League. In 18 games and 109 innings pitched, he went 7–8 with a 4.05 earned run average. That winter, Dibut returned to the Cuban League and signed with the Leopardos de Santa Clara. The team, which featured Negro league and Cuban stars Oscar Charleston, Alejandro Oms, Dobie Moore, and Oliver Marcelle, along with a pitching staff of Bill Holland, Dave Brown, Rube Currie, Merven Ryan, and José Méndez, in addition to Dibut, dominated the league with a 36–11 record and finished games ahead of second place Habana.Figueredo 2003, pp. 148–151. According to Figueredo, the 1923/24 Leopardos are \\"considered as the most dominant team ever in the history of Cuban baseball.\\"Figueredo 2003, p. 148. Dibut appeared in nine games with a 3–3 record.Figueredo 2003, p. 150. =Cincinnati Reds= That winter the Cincinnati Reds signed Dibut as a free agent. Dibut made his major league debut on May 1 against the Chicago Cubs, entering in the seventh with the Reds behind 8 to 1. He pitched the last two innings without giving up a run, allowing only one hit. After one appearance, Dibut was assigned to the Bridgeport Bears of the Eastern League. In late June, he was reassigned to the St. Petersburg Saints of the Florida State League. He went 8–2 with the Saints and allowed only 13 runs in 75 innings pitched. In August Dibut was recalled by the Cincinnati Reds and on August 17 he appeared in his second major league game. He entered in the top of the fifth inning against Brooklyn with the Reds behind 8 to 3, and pitched five shutout innings without giving up a hit. The final score was 8 to 5. He made his first major league start a week later against Boston and pitched a complete game, holding the Braves to two runs on four hits in an 8–2 victory for the Reds. Dibut finished the 1924 season with a 3–0 record in seven major league games—two complete game starts and five relief appearances. His earned run average was 2.21 in innings pitched. At the end of the season, he was offered a contract for the following year which stipulated that he was not allowed to play winter ball in Cuba. In the spring of 1925, Dibut reported late to spring training because of difficulties in obtaining a passport. It was reported that the problems were due to a felony conviction several years earlier in Cuba. Dibut developed a sore arm in spring training in Orlando, but remained on the Reds' roster when the season started. His only appearance in 1925 occurred on April 22 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He came into the game in the bottom of the first with two outs, two runners on base, and the Reds already behind 7 to 2. He proceeded to give up consecutive hits to Rogers Hornsby, Jim Bottomley, and Les Bell, allowing four more runs to score. Harry Biemiller was called in to relieve Dibut before he'd recorded any outs. On May 6, manager Jack Hendricks announced that the Reds had unconditionally released Dibut. =Later career= In the spring of 1926, Dibut returned to the St. Petersburg Saints, saying that he hoped to return to Cincinnati. In the early weeks of the season, Dibut pitched and also played right field. He was released by the Saints and played for two teams in the amateur city league. In mid-summer he signed with the Raleigh Capitals in the Piedmont League, where he went 8–12 with a 2.93 ERA. In the winter of 1926/27 Dibut returned to pitch in the Cuban League, pitching for Habana. He went 5–3; his five wins tied for the league lead. His Habana team won the league pennant. In 1927/28 he finished his Cuban League career, pitching two games for Habana without recording a decision.Figueredo 2003, pp. 167–168, 175. In the summers of 1928 and 1929, Dibut pitched for the Jacksonville Tars of the Southeastern League. During the 1929 spring training, the Tars played and beat the world champion New York Yankees. Dibut entered the game in the top of the fifth with the Tars trailing 10 to 4. He allowed two runs in the fifth, then held the Yankees scoreless in the last four innings. Meanwhile, the Tars scored 9 runs and won the game 13 to 12, with Dibut the winning pitcher. In 1928, Dibut went 9–7 with a 3.63 ERA for Jacksonville, and in 1929 he went 4–4 with a 4.28 ERA, pitching for both the Jacksonville Tars and the Pensacola Flyers.

His departure provoked a public outcry over an alleged pattern of censorship by the museum,Merritt, Robert, \\"Conflict of Ideals Key to Resignation of Theater Director,\\" Richmond Times-Dispatch, March 31, 1977 with some arts patrons supporting the administrationStalnaker, Shirley R., \\"If She Desired 'Trash,' She Would See a Movie,\\" in \\"Voice of the People,\\" Richmond Times-Dispatch, April 1, 1977 and many standing by Fowler, asserting, for instance, that \\"no one else can jump in and claim credit for what Dr. Fowler has done ... he stood up for what he knew was right.\\"Pahnelas, William, \\"Fowler Resigns, Cites Artistic Differences,\\" The Commonwealth Times, March 29-April 4, 1977 American Revels Company He returned to Richmond in 1978 with his associate director M. Elizabeth Osborn to lease the Empire Theater (since renamed the November Theater), on the border between historically black Jackson Ward and the city's business district, where they founded the American Revels Company.A LORT \\"B\\" company Revels attracted progressive support for appealing to both black and white communities in Richmond. Without intending to enter into Richmond's post-segregation politics, Fowler nevertheless found Revels becoming a rallying point in the late 1970s for re-balancing the two symbiotic communities through art. Funding through the box office and City Council support was affected directly by public favor in a city with a growing black majority.Merritt, Robert, \\"Revels' 'Dream' Is Worth Wait...,\\" Richmond Times- Dispatch, April 24, 1979, A-7 Unity Audience Following a summer of advance promotion, American Revels' first seasonOffering Fowler's version of A Christmas Carol, The Club, Holy Ghosts, by Romulus Linney, Shakespeare's Othello, and a drama of Martin Luther King, Jr., I have a Dream started with strong audiences, including full houses for A Christmas Carol and The Club in the thousand-seat theater. Such peaks in attendance could not be sustained, however, when later play titles, including Othello and I Have a Dream, leaned toward those least likely to afford tickets—the African-American community. Fowler countered by offering free performances to neighboring residents.Steger, Martha, \\"Keith Fowler: Rebel With a Cause, Virginia Lifestyle magazine, June/July 1979 The plan drew hundreds of African-American theater-goers and began to build a new sector of audience. In the summer of 1979, Richmond's City Council awarded the company a challenge grant,For $25,000 to be matched to $50,000; Steger. and a patron stepped forward to raise matching funds by sponsoring a performance by entertainer Ray Charles to benefit Revels. The success of the fund drive propelled the company into a second season in which Revels dealt with racial issues head-on by presenting a satire entitled The Black and White Minstrel Show, a parody of the racially split City Council.And offering excerpts of it on the steps of Richmond City Hall.Modeled after The Minstrel Show or Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel, premiered in 1967 by the San Francisco Mime Troupe. The season continued with works aimed at all of Richmond;In addition to the Minstrel Show, the second season included Twelfth Night, Tales from the Vienna Woods, by Ödön von Horváth, American Buffalo, El Grande de Coca Cola, and Ashes of Soldiers. A co-production with the Haymarket Theater of Showboat was a bonus to subscribers. A special rhythm and blues dance concert, Strutters Ball, was added in mid-season to honor local black and white headliners, Larry Bland and Steve Bassett. A new play by Kevin Heelan, Hope I Hear it Again Sometime, concluded the year. Revels found resurgent support for its balance of classics and new plays, as well as for an occasional special event, such as the popular Strutters’ Ball, featuring local celebrity talent. Still the costs of production were higher than the purses and wallets of many in the core audience could support. American Revels closed after two seasons. The company had made its mark. Revels mounted fourteen productions between 1978 and 1980. By presenting actors of color and dramas with black themes—alongside classics and \\"standard\\" works—the company drew a sizable African-American audience to live theater, many for the first time. Richmonders found that new plays and politically engaged works were not alien to their taste. Also, by resurrecting the long-dormant Empire/November Theater, the troupe pioneered the way for downtown professional theater, most significantly for Theatre IV/Virginia Rep, the subsequent occupant of the November. For such a legacy, many Richmonders remember the company fondly, counting the Revels years as a time of theatrical excitement, and Fowler—in the words of Richmond Lifestyle magazine—as a \\"Rebel with a Cause.\\" Teaching After closing Revels, Fowler returned to acting at the Pittsburgh Public Theater and joined Yale classmate Robert Cohen, then chair of drama, on the faculty of the University of California, Irvine. Among the research topics that drew Fowler's focus was the relationship between acting and hypnosis, through which he developed protocols for characterization.Fowler, Keith, \\"Hypnotic Transformation\\" in The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, 1988, vol. XXXVI, No. 4. See also National Auxiliary Publication Service. In collateral studies he learned that actors are, as a group, significantly more susceptible to trance than the general population. He established that actors who display versatility playing characters are those who show a high \\"Femininity\\" index on the California Psychological Inventory (CPI). In 1984, he joined Jerzy Grotowski's \\"Objective Drama\\" project in the barn and fields south of the UCI campus, working with Grotowski day and night to explore the essential organons and yantras of performance.Slowiak, James, and Jairo Cuesta, Jerzy Grotowski, p. 59 He later memorialized the experience in American Theatre magazine.Fowler, Keith, \\"The Grotowski Papers\\" in American Theatre, January 2014, pp. 92–98. From 1996 to 2004, Fowler was the original director of ArtsBridge America, later expanded nationwide, a program created by then dean Jill Beck at UCI in 1996 for granting scholarships to university dance, drama, music, and studio art majors to reintroduce arts education into the depleted curricula of K-12 pupils in local schools. In 2011, Fowler completed a record tenure of over thirty years as head of directing for UCI's top-ranked drama program, mentoring hundreds of undergraduate and graduate directing students—many of whom have gone on to become award-winners, producers, and artistic directors of their own companiesDistinguished former students of Fowler include * Peter Anthony, director, OpenStage Theatre and Company, Fort Collins, Colorado; * Constantine Arvanitakis, director, Athens Conservatoire, Greece; * Trevor Biship, winner of awards for Jerry Springer...; * Stephen Burdman, artistic director, New York Classical Theatre, New York, New York; * caryn morse desai, artistic director, International City Theater, Long Beach, California; * Bryan Doerries, artistic director, Theater of War; author The Theater of War, Alfred A.

Fowler retired from active teaching in December 2015 and is now a professor emeritus. Plan B vs. Plan A One of Fowler's teachings is that directors must be over- prepared to guide a production team in designing and rehearsing a show. Co- author of A Director's Guide, Janelle K. EagleConversation in Hoag Hospital 02/19/2012, followed by email from filmmaker and community activist Eagle to Fowler, 02/24/2012 points to his statement, \\"The notion of a modest Plan B to 'fall back on' is a mistaken concept,\\" as a highlight of the Guide. Eagle finds the notion applying to a variety of fields, quoting again: \\"The magnificent exchanges for which one wishes, those that lead to real discovery and leaps into true art, can only occur spontaneously when all are ready, when sparks are struck right there in the moment with colleagues. That is Plan A.\\" Among Fowler's major productions at UCI have been Molière's Le Misanthrope, (translated by Robert Cohen), Sam Shepard's The Tooth of Crime, Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters and Uncle Vanya, Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing and Arcadia, Brecht and Weill's The Threepenny Opera, Heiner Müller's Hamletmachine, and Fowler's own translation of Georg Büchner's Woyzeck.Müller in America, American Productions of Heiner Müller, copyright 2003 by Castillo Cultural Center Personal life Born in San Francisco's French Hospital to Jack Franklin and Jacqueline Hocking Montgomery Fowler, Keith is a graduate of George Washington High and SF State.

He previously played for the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets. Panik was an All-Star in 2015 and won a Gold Glove Award in 2016. Early life Panik was born in Yonkers, New York, to Paul and Natalie Panik, but the family lived in East Fishkill during his formative years. He attended John Jay High School in Hopewell Junction. He attended St. John's University, where he played college baseball for the St. John's Red Storm, competing in the Big East Conference. After his sophomore season in 2010, Panik played collegiate summer baseball for the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he batted .297 in 50 games, was named the starting shortstop for the East Division All-Star team, and received the league's sportsmanship award. During his junior season, Panik compiled a .398 batting average with 19 doubles, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBI), ranking tenth among college baseball players with a .509 on-base percentage (OBP). Panik played the first ever game at Citi Field in a pre-season game between St. John's University and Georgetown on March 29, 2009. Panik earned All-America honors from the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA), Baseball America and Louisville Slugger. Panik was also a finalist for the Brooks Wallace Award, an honor given to the nation's top shortstop. He was also a first team ABCA All- Northeast Region honoree, a first team All-Big East selection, and the Red Storm Most Valuable Player. Professional career =Draft and minor leagues= Out of St. John's, the Giants drafted Panik in the first round, with the 29th overall selection, of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. Panik made his professional debut with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. He led the league with a .341 batting average, 49 runs scored, 54 RBI and a .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for Salem- Keizer, winning the league's Most Valuable Player award. He was rated the tenth best second base prospect prior to the 2012 season and was invited to spring training. Panik with the Richmond Flying Squirrels in Panik spent the 2012 season with the San Jose Giants of the Class A-Advanced California League, batting .297 with 27 doubles, seven home runs, and 76 RBI in 130 games. In 2013, Panik was promoted to the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League, where he was moved to second base and recorded a .333 on-base percentage and 27 doubles, four triples, four homers. In 2014, Panik started the season with the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he hit .321, with five home runs, 45 RBIs, and 50 runs scored in 74 games. =San Francisco Giants (2014–2019)= 2014-2015 Panik made his MLB debut on June 21, 2014, pinch-hitting for the pitcher in the 8th inning and drawing a walk against Arizona Diamondbacks relief pitcher Matt Stites in a game the Giants won 6–4. Panik's first Major League start came the next day, when he batted seventh and played second base. In his second at-bat in that game he registered his first MLB hit. Panik hit his first home run on August 22, against Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals. It was a 3-run home run (one of Panik's 4 hits that night), which gave the Giants the lead in a game they eventually won 10–3. On September 1, Panik pinch-hit in the resumption of a game against the Colorado Rockies that began on May 22 but was suspended due to rain. Per MLB bookkeeping policy, Panik's debut is formally recognized as May 22, 2014. On October 16, in the 2014 National League Championship Series, Panik hit a two-run home run in Game 5 to help lead the Giants to an eventual 6–3 victory over the Cardinals to advance to the 2014 World Series against the Royals. On October 29, in Game 7 of the World Series, the Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 3–2 to win the series. In the bottom of the third inning with a runner on first, Panik made a diving stop on a ball up the middle and flipped the ball with his glove to shortstop Brandon Crawford to get the lead runner out. Crawford then threw to first to try to get a sliding Eric Hosmer out. Initially, Hosmer was called safe on the play but after a three-minute replay review, the call was overturned for the 4–6–3 double play. It was the first ever overturned call in the World Series since the replay review system was implemented, and the double play was regarded by multiple sportswriters as one of the most spectacular plays in World Series history. In the 2014 regular season, Panik played in 73 games and recorded 269 at bats. He scored 31 runs and 82 hits. He had 10 doubles and 2 triples along with one home run. Panik also recorded 18 runs batted. He was walked 16 times and struck out 33 times. He did not steal any bases. He finished with a .305 average and an on base percentage of .343. Panik was named to the Giants' 2015 Opening Day 25-man roster. On April 22, 2015, Panik hit a walk-off sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3–2. Panik hit another walk-off nine days later on May 1, a pinch-hit, bases-loaded single against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On May 3, in a 5–0 win over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Panik batted second and homered off of Jered Weaver right after Nori Aoki homered to start the game. It was the first time the Giants started off a game with consecutive home runs since . On July 6, Panik was selected as a reserve player for the 2015 All Star Game. On August 3, Panik was placed on the 15-day disabled list with lower back inflammation. He returned for three games in September before he was shut down for the season. For the 2015 season, Panik batted .312, with 8 home runs, 37 RBIs, and 59 runs scored. After the season, Panik revealed that the \\"back inflammation\\" was actually a stress fracture of the L5 vertebra and that it had fully healed by December. 2016-2019 Panik played in a career-high 127 games in 2016, hitting 10 home runs and 62 RBIs, although his batting average dipped to .239. Panik missed most of July with concussion symptoms after being hit in the head by a pitch from (future teammate) Matt Moore on June 18. After the season, Panik was awarded a Gold Glove, becoming the first Giants second baseman to win since Robby Thompson in 1993. In 2017, Panik set a Giants franchise record, and tied the MLB record, with 12 hits in a three- game series against the Colorado Rockies from September 4–6. He was the first major leaguer to accomplish the feat since Jerry Remy in 1981. For the season, he batted .288/.347/.421. On Opening Day against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2018, Panik hit a solo home run off of Clayton Kershaw, with the Giants winning the game 1–0. The next evening, Panik hit a solo home run off of Kenley Jansen in the top of the ninth inning, again lifting the Giants to a 1–0 victory, and becoming the first player in MLB history to homer for his team in back-to-back 1–0 victories. He also hit a solo shot in the Giants' home opener against the Seattle Mariners, making him the first MLB player to score his team's first 3 runs in a season off solo home runs. On July 7, he was placed on the disabled list. He was reactivated on July 30, 2018. For the season he batted .254/.307/.332 with 4 home runs in 358 at bats.Joe Panik Stats  Baseball-Reference.com On August 6, 2019, Panik was designated for assignment. He had been hitting .235/.310/.317, with an OPS of .627 and 3 home runs. He was placed on release waivers on August 7. =New York Mets= On August 9, 2019, Panik signed with the New York Mets.

He batted .277/.333/.404, with 12 RBI's and 2 home runs, during his time with the Mets. Panik became a free agent following the 2019 season. =Toronto Blue Jays= On January 18, 2020, Panik signed a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. He impressed in Spring Training and he was added to the 40-man roster on March 15. Overall with the 2020 Blue Jays, Panik batted .225 with one home run and 7 RBIs in 41 games. In the AL Wild Card Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, he went 1 for 6, making the final out in both games as the Blue Jays were swept in the best-of-3 series. Personal life Panik and his wife, Brittany (née Pinto), have known each other since they were children and married in December 2016. He has participated in a baseball clinic hosted by Matt Barnes at a Newtown, Connecticut Youth Academy for elementary school students in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

A son of Kentucky governor John L. Helm, he was born in Bardstown, Kentucky. He attended the Kentucky Military Institute and the West Point Military Academy and then studied law at the University of Louisville and Harvard University. He served as a state legislator and the state's attorney in Kentucky. Helm was offered the position of Union Army paymaster by his brother-in-law, President Abraham Lincoln (Helm was married to Emilie Todd, the half-sister of Mary Todd Lincoln), a position which he declined. Helm joined the Confederate States Army. As a brigadier general, Helm commanded the 1st Kentucky Brigade, more commonly known as The Orphan Brigade. He died on the battlefield during the Battle of Chickamauga. Early life Helm Place in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Helm during his Kentucky State Guard service, 1860. The son of lawyer and politician John L. Helm and Lucinda Barbour Hardin, Benjamin Hardin Helm was born in Bardstown, Kentucky on June 2, 1831.; In the winter of 1846, at age 15, Helm enrolled at the Kentucky Military Institute, where he remained for three months. He left on his 16th birthday to accept an appointment at West Point the same day. Helm graduated in 1851 near his 20th birthday, ranked 9th in a class of 42 cadets., He became a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He served at a cavalry school at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and at Fort Lincoln, Texas, but resigned his commission after a year, when he was diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatism., Helm then studied law at the University of Louisville and Harvard University, graduating in 1853 and practicing law with his father. In 1855, he was elected to the House of Representatives of Kentucky from Hardin County, and was the state's attorney for the 3rd district of Kentucky from 1856 to 1858., In 1856, Helm married Emilie Todd, a half-sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. In 1860, he was appointed assistant inspector-general of the Kentucky State Guard, which he was active in organizing. Kentucky remained officially neutral during the early stages of the American Civil War, but his brother-in-law, now President Abraham Lincoln, offered him the position of paymaster of the Union Army. Helm declined the offer, and returned to Kentucky to raise the 1st Kentucky Cavalry Regiment for the Confederate Army. Military career Helm was commissioned a colonel on October 19, 1861, and served under Brigadier General Simon B. Buckner in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Helm and the 1st Kentucky were then ordered south. He was promoted to brigadier general on March 14, 1862 and, three weeks later, received a new assignment to raise the 3rd Kentucky Brigade, in the division of Major General John C. Breckinridge. During the Battle of Shiloh, Helm used his brigade to guard the Confederate flanks. In 1862, he was also sent to protect the Arkansas, an ironclad warship of the Confederate Navy under construction in Yazoo City, Mississippi. Serving under Breckinridge in January 1863, he was given command of the First Kentucky Brigade, commonly known as the \\"Orphan Brigade\\".; Helm's brigade was assigned to the Army of Tennessee, where it participated in the 1863 Tullahoma and Chickamauga campaigns. Near the end of the spring of 1863, Breckinridge ordered Helm to deploy the brigade to Vicksburg, Mississippi to participate in General Joseph E. Johnston's unsuccessful attempt to break the siege. Helm called it \\"the most unpleasant and trying [campaign] of his career\\". Battle of Chickamauga and death Bust of Helm by Anton Schaaf at Vicksburg National Military Park, 1914 In the fall of 1863, the 1st Kentucky Brigade formed a part of General Braxton Bragg's counteroffensive against Union Major General William Rosecrans in Chattanooga, Tennessee. At 9:30 am on September 20, 1863, the divisions of Generals Breckinridge and Patrick Cleburne were ordered to move forward. Helm's brigade and the others in Breckinridge's division drove into the Federals' left. General Cleburne's division, which was intended to strike near the center of the line, was delayed by heavy fire from Union soldiers, leaving the left flank unguarded. Repeated attempts to overwhelm the Federals were in vain, though some of Helm's Kentuckians and Alabamians managed to reach within of the Federal line. In less than an hour of the order given to advance, fully one third of the Orphan Brigade had been lost. While the remainder of Helm's men clashed with the Union line, a sharpshooter from the 15th Kentucky Union Infantry shot Helm in the chest. Bleeding profusely, he remained in the saddle a few moments before toppling to the ground.; After being carried off the battlefield, Helm's surgeons concluded that his wounds would be fatal. Helm clung to life for several hours. Knowing that his health was deteriorating, he asked who had won the battle. When assured that the Confederates had carried the day, he muttered: \\"Victory!, Victory!, Victory!\\".; On September 21, 1863, Gen. Helm succumbed to his wounds. Following his death, Abraham Lincoln and his wife went into private mourning at the White House. Mary Lincoln's niece recalled: \\"She knew that a single tear shed for a dead enemy would bring torrents of scorn and bitter abuse on both her husband and herself.\\" However, the widowed Emilie Todd Helm was granted safe passage to the White House in December 1863. In an official report of the Battle of Chickamauga, General Daniel Harvey Hill stated that Benjamin Helm's \\"gallantry and loveliness of character endeared him to everyone.\\" In a letter to Emilie Todd Helm, General Breckinridge said, \\"Your husband commanded them [the men of the Orphan brigade] like a thorough soldier.

She was born in Lydden, Kent, England on 30 January 1830. Early life Sarah was the youngest child of five, born to Stephen Sharp and his wife Mary Ann Emery, who died in October 1833 when Sarah was only 2. Her father remarried in June 1834 however in October 1834, her step-mother too died in childbirth, along with her baby, a year to the week from when Sarah's mother had died. Sarah's grandparents then moved in with the family. Sarah received a basic education, including sewing and reading, however did not learn to write. When Sarah was eleven, her father answered an appeal for skilled manual labourers to emigrate to New Zealand in the employ of the New Zealand Company, an independent company revived by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who became Director. The New Zealand Company primarily required young married couples perhaps with a young family, or older couples with grown or near grown children, who had manual skills such as carpentry, farming, labourers, builders, millers and so on, who could contribute to building the new colonies on land purchased by the Company and sold as stakes to the emigrants and to increase the future population. Stephen Higgins was initially turned down on application due to his widower status, however doctors intervened and wrote a letter to the company directors instructing them of the ill-health of Sarah's older sister, and confirming that they could do nothing further for her, but advising that it was in the professional opinion that the fresh air of New Zealand would be of profound benefit to her prognosis. Stephen Sharp was accepted. He sold his belongings and used the money to purchase his stake and assisted passage. New Zealand The Sharps - Stephen, Susannah aged 21, Robert aged 18, George aged 12 and Sarah aged 11 left Dover on board the Bolton in October 1841, the journey taking five months. Susannah Sharp died aboard the Bolton on the voyage and was buried at sea. The remaining family arrived in New Zealand on 15 March 1842, in what is now Lambton harbour close to Nelson Colony, Wellington. The Sharps were initially sent to make shelter in one of the communal buildings, put together for the newly arriving colonists. They remained there for some time, sleeping on a rough bed of ferns, with borrowed blankets. Because of the number of arriving ships, and the shallow nature of the harbour, ships were unable to pull into the quayside area, and so were forced to anchor offshore. Passengers disembarked and made land by means of small craft, being forced to leave their belongings behind on board until such times as they could be transferred to shore. The land that they were alleged to have bought was later subject to disagreement between the New Zealand Company and the local Maori chiefs from whom they claimed to have purchased. The stakes they had sold were described in the advertisement as being within an area of rich agricultural land, ideal for cultivation of crops and fruit trees. The initial stakeholders for the most part had no intentions of physically making the journey to New Zealand to take up the land, and so in a hasty spot of double-dealing, the company had distributed these claims to the arriving settlers, in the hope that more land could be negotiated from the Maori. The land however was poor, and swampy, covered in wild grasses, ferns and bush which would need clearing before any building or cultivation could begin, and contrary to the images of the town plan, which showed cleared flat ground, the majority of the stakes were hidden amongst undulating higher ground. The continuing disagreement with the Maori descended into violence in 1843, following the British Government's intervention and the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. This in effect placed further purchases of land on hold and called the validity of the existing sales into question. Violence followed, with the Wairau Affray during which the local council leader, Captain Arthur Wakefield, brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, was killed along with 21 others. Sarah recalls the incident with vivid yet simple horror. The effects were dreadful for the settlers in the town.. Not only were they concerned with further reprisals, but the death of their leader and main employer meant the work building the roads and houses stopped, and wages with it. Hunger became an issue and Sarah recalls local Maoris trying to assist by selling them a few vegetables, and teaching them which berries and fruits were safe to eat. Despite this, many of the new settlers were forced to leave their stakes and transfer some miles away to another settlement in Spring Grove. Sarah's family were one of them. Having arrived in 1842 with no housekeeping skills whatsoever, it fell to Sarah as the only female of the house to learn the skills required to run the house; she took it upon herself to visit neighboring women and watch them cooking and cleaning to learn how to perform the duties in her own home. Her first attempt at cooking a meal for her father almost ended in disaster when she made him a pancake. Whilst tossing it to cook the underside, the pancake fell out of the pan into the ashes by the fire. Her father laughed and told her she was not as clever as she thought, but ate the pancake nonetheless. She took in sewing to earn a few extra shillings. Following their move to Spring Grove, Stephen Sharp was given work as a farm overseer which necessitated his being away from home between Monday and Saturday each week. With both of her brothers also out at work, Sarah was offered a position as a live-in domestic help to a slightly wealthier family, the Ottersons in nearby Richmond. Sarah remained with the family for 14 months, and used the time to learn a variety of skills, which she later put to good use, including butter making, in the family dairy and cooking. During her time with the Ottersons, Sarah was courted by a young man from Spring Grove, Sydney Higgins who worked as a sawyer. Following her release from the service of the Ottersons, as Sarah's father returned home, Sarah moved back to Spring Grove and she and Sydney married in 1849. They purchased a small plot of land, and a few cattle and pigs, and built a small one roomed house. Over the following few years, they expanded the home to include a large kitchen, and Sarah helped her husband grow and harvest the crops, and tend the animals. Their family started to grow, and soon they moved to a larger plot and again built a home, including a dairy where Sarah made butter. Her father and brothers bought the land adjoining. Midwife and writer As her family grew, Sarah earned extra income by renting out rooms to disabled boarders, and took in sewing. She also went out with a local doctor, assisting him on his patient visits. She learned basic nursing skills which she later used to set herself up as a midwife. As her daughters grew older, they assisted her. It is thought Sarah delivered around 350 babies in the Nelson/ Spring Grove areas. Sydney and Sarah had eleven children, all of whom survived and grew to adulthood. As they left home, they remained in the area. In 1903 Sydney died suddenly, leaving Sarah a widow at the age of 73; a year later following the movement of her last children to other areas, Sarah was finally forced to learn to write, in order to be able to communicate with them. When in her early 80s Sarah wrote with amazing clarity a history of her life, which was later put into a collection of stories of the first female pioneers of the frontier colonies of the nineteenth century and published in 1961. On 23 September 1923, Sarah Higgins died aged 93. Her life as one of the first settlers of the new colonies in New Zealand covered 81 years, accounted for the inception of the country as part of the British empire, and ended as the empire reached its twilight. Three years after her death, New Zealand was given British Dominion status. Her personal account of her life as an emigrant is simple yet detailed, and demonstrates a profound insight into the trials and hardships of a young girl living on the edge of a new frontier.

Early life  Hicks was born in London, England, the daughter of a baker, George Martens, and his wife Elizabeth (née Joyner). She emigrated first to Australia and then to New Zealand, arriving in Otago in 1862. She initially worked as a domestic servant in Dunedin and then as a stewardess on the steam ships which ran between Invercargill, Bluff and Lyttelton.  Adult life  Hicks married Henry Hicks of New York in 1864 and they moved to Mosgiel. At the time of their marriage he was the owner of the New York tearooms in Bluff near Invercargill, however, he had previously worked as a crewman on vessels of various types. After their marriage, he returned to this work while Hicks took domestic work. In 1879 the couple moved to Dukes Road Taieri/Mosgiel area and set up a firewood business. In 1884 Hicks' husband was kicked while carelessly stabling a horse and died, leaving her with nine young children to raise. Two years later she moved her family to 16 Factory Road in Mosgiel and opened a maternity home, \\"Hicks' Maternity Home\\". Although she had no formal nursing training, her establishment became the first registered maternity home in the area. The earliest surviving records of Hicks' home suggest it was small - in 1909, she attended 10 women, three in their own homes and the remainder at Hicks' home. In the small community of Mosgiel, Hicks was called on to assist in a variety of medical situations; in 1918 she was a volunteer nurse for patients of the influenza epidemic, and on one occasion she attended the scene of a train accident where rail workers had been killed and injured while at work in the Wingatui tunnel. In 1922 Hicks left the nursing home in her daughter Edith's hands and travelled to England to visit her brothers. On this visit she was summoned to meet the then British Queen, Queen Mary. She retired in 1927 and Edith carried on the maternity service until Hicks died in 1930. After her mother's death, Edith moved to Winton and was a maternity nurse at a hospital there.

East Scotia Ridge (nomen nudum) is an as yet undescribed species of small, deep-sea sea snail, a hydrothermal vent limpet, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Lepetodrilidae. The first information about this species, under the name \\"Lepetodrilus n. sp.\\", was published on 3 January 2012. Location of E2 and E9 sites in the Scotia Sea showing the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) between the Scotia Plate (SCO) and South Sandwich Plate (SAN). Distribution This species is known from two sites near hydrothermal vents in the East Scotia Ridge: from 2,394 m depth at the E9 vent site, and from 2,608 m depth at the E2 site. Description Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene of this limpet (GenBank accession number JN628254) and a range of other Lepetodrilus species, using Bayesian inference, places this species from East Scotia Ridge as a sister taxon to Lepetodrilus atlanticus, with a sequence divergence from this species of 5.48%. This level of genetic divergence is consistent with that found between Lepetodrilus species within complexes of sister taxa, where interspecific distances of between 3% and 15% have been observed. Ecology Numerous individuals of the hydrothermal vent limpet Lepetodrilus sp. East Scotia Ridge partially cover the shells of Gigantopelta chessoia on the East Scotia Ridge site E2 in the Scotia Sea, SouthAtlantic Ocean. Scale bar 10 cm.

She made three voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). During her first voyage, in 1796, a French privateer captured her, but the Royal Navy recaptured her. On the second, in 1799, she transported convicts from Ireland to Australia. She made a second voyage transporting convicts in 1817-18. On her way back she was broken up in 1819 at Mauritius after having been found unseaworthy. Career In 1794 Friendship was under the command of Captain Thomas Black and sailing between London and Jamaica. Lloyd's Register for 1795 continues the information unchanged.Lloyd's Register (1795), seq. no. 354. Lloyd's Register for 1796 shows Friendship changing her trade to London-Cape of Good Hope.Lloyd's Register (1796), seq. no. F338. =EIC voyage #1 (1796)= Captain Black received a letter of marque on 16 February 1796. Friendship left Portsmouth on 23 February 1796, bound for Bengal. She reached São Tiago on 5 April, Simons Bay on 28 May, and the Cape on 13 June. On 27 October Friendship was on her way home when the French privateer Aventure captured her and placed her crew on the American ship Henry.British Library: Friendship (1). The capture took place at and her captor sent Friendship towards France.Lloyd's List, №2869. On 4 November recaptured Friendship and sent her into Plymouth.Lloyd's List, №2873. =Restoration= Lloyd's Register for 1797 showed several changes: J. Newham replaced Black as master, and her trade changed to London-Bengal. However the most dramatic change was that her burthen changed from 341 tons (bm) to 430 tons (bm). The explanation rests in the annotations: Friendship had undergone lengthening.Lloyd's Register (1797), Seq. №F356. Her ownership remains Oldham & Co. However, the next year Lloyd's Register reported it as having changed to Mangles & Co.Lloyd's Register (1798), Seq. №F378. =EIC voyage #2 (1797–98)= Captain John Newham received a letter of marque on 11 April 1797. For Friendships second voyage for the EIC, Newham left Falmouth on 11 May 1797, bound for Bengal and Madras. Friendship arrived at Calcutta on 28 October. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 21 January 1798. She reached Madras on 4 February, the Cape on 26 May, and St Helena on 26 May. She arrived at Long Reach on 4 August. =Convict transport and EIC voyage #3= On 4 March 1799 Captain Hugh Reid received a letter of marque for Friendship.Letter of Marque, 1793-1815; p.64 Friendship, under Reid's command, sailed from Cork, Ireland on 24 August 1799. She left in company with Minerva, but the vessels separated and Friendship arrived at Port Jackson on 16 February 1800, a month after Minerva.Bateson (1959), pp.139-140. Friendship left with 133 male convicts, a number of whom were members of the Society of United Irishmen. Nineteen convicts died on the voyage.Bateson (1959), p.142. Friendship left Port Jackson for Bengal on 11 May 1800. Friendship reached Malacca on 9 August, Penang on 20 August, and Diamond Harbour on 16 September. For her return to Britain she passed Culpee, an anchorage towards Calcutta and closer than Saugor, on 29 November.

The convoy reached Madeira on 23 September, and left the next day.Lloyd's List, no. 4200. Lloyd's Register for 1803 gives Friendships trade as London to Jamaica. In 1809, her trade changes to London to Cape of Good Hope, and her armament changes too, though there is no change in ownership or master.Lloyd's Register (1809), Seq. №720. By 1811 her trade is again London - Jamaica. In 1813, her master becomes E. Smith. =Second convict voyage (1817–18)= Friendship, under the command of Captain Armet and with surgeon Peter Cosgreave, left England on 3 July 1817 and arrived at Port Jackson on 14 January 1818.Bateson (1959), pp.290-91. She carried 101 female convicts, four of whom died on the voyage.Bateson (1959), p. 327. South west of Madeira, Friendship encountered an open boat with six Spaniards and an American on board. The men had fashioned sails out of their shirts, and were exhausted and hungry, having had nothing but a little raw turtle in the preceding six days. Armet took the men aboard and on 7 August was able to transfer them to an American ship.Bateson (1959), p. 189. During the voyage there was apparently a great deal of prostitution by the female convicts on what had been a fairly lengthy voyage of 194 days. The problem had begun before the ship left England and despite the efforts of Armet and Cosgreave, continued unabated. When Friendship reached St Helena, Cosgreave asked the admiral in charge of the station for assistance in prohibiting cohabitation between the women and the ship's officers and seamen; two post captains made an inquiry, but without any resolution. When Friendship reached Port Jackson, Governor Macquarie appointed three magistrates to conduct a second, separate inquiry that exonerated Armet and Cosgreave of any dereliction of duty. Fate Friendship, Armet, master, arrived at Port Louis, Mauritius, on 5 August 1818 from Sumatra. There she was surveyed and condemned as being unseaworthy. Lloyd's List reported that she and her cargo were to be sold on 23 September.Lloyd's List, №5346 (25 December 1818). Friendship was broken up in 1819.

Her book The Native Flora of New Zealand was published in English and French. She was born in Battersea, Surrey, England on 27 May 1832. Early life Hetley was the second daughter of Annette and Dugald McKellar, a doctor. The family moved to Madeira, Portugal when Hetley was around 10 years old, leaving in 1852 for New Zealand when her father died. Annette McKellar bought a block of about fifty acres of land at Omata, six miles south of New Plymouth. She called their farm Fernlea. Hetley subsequently married a fellow settler Charles Hetly in the Omata church on 2 June 1856 and moved to Brookwood farm. Just prior to their first wedding anniversary Charles died, leaving Hetly with a newborn son. This led to Hetley selling her farm and returning to Fernlea to live with her mother. Hetley lived in Taranaki until 1860 when the First Taranaki War broke out. The conflict led to Anette McKellar moving her family to New Plymouth. Fernlea was burnt down in the ensuing conflict. While in Taranaki, Hetley began drawing sketches and watercolours of the farm and surrounding landscapes. She continued this practice after the move to New Plymouth, painting the urban scenes in New Plymouth, Waikato and Auckland. She and her son moved to Auckland by 1879. Exhibitions and publications In 1879, Hetley exhibited with the Auckland Society of Artists. In 1885 she won first prize at the New Zealand Industrial Exhibition in Wellington for her paintings of indigenous plants. Following a lecture about a botanical trip to Nelson given by Thomas Frederic Cheeseman at the Auckland Museum in 1881,—and with considerable encouragement from him—Hetley was inspired to write a comprehensive guide to New Zealand flora. This would be following in the style of Dr Walter Buller's book on New Zealand birds that had been published in 1873. By 1884, she had started work on a book of native plants, The Native Flowers of New Zealand Illustrated in Colours, embarking (with the backing from the government and the Union Steamship Company) on a trip around New Zealand to obtain live specimens. She collected plants from the North Island and travelled to the South Island to collect specimens from Nelson, Greymouth and Arthurs Pass. She spent six weeks in Christchurch, sketching the plants in their botanical gardens which came from places she was unable to travel to. This included Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands. Trilepidea adamsii (previously known as Loranthus adamsii) by Georgina Burne Hetley. Hetley went to England to seek a publisher, receiving assistance along the way from authorities at Kew, and the chromolithographs were ultimately produced in 1888 by Leighton Brothers. The plates also had the distinction of being published in a French edition a year later. The inclusion in the book of Loranthus adamsii is notable as this native mistletoe was discovered by Mr James Adams of the Thames goldfields shortly before it became extinct. Without the work of botanical artists such as Hetley there would be no record of what this plant truly looked like. While in London, her work was exhibited at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. Hetley returned to New Zealand in 1889 and exhibited her New Zealand flora at the General Assembly Library in Wellington. She also help another major exhibit, 150 paintings in all, at Auckland Museum. Hetley lived in Auckland for the rest of her life, dying there after a long illness, on 29 August 1898.

She identified with the Ngati Maniapoto iwi. Early life Hetet was born in Oparure, King Country, New Zealand on 24 May 1892, the daughter of Charles Wilson Hursthouse and Mere Te Rongopamamao Aubrey. Through her father she was a niece of Richmond Hursthouse and Henry Robert Richmond. As her father was generally away for survey work, she grew up amongst Ngati Kinohaku, a hapū (sub-tribe) of Ngati Maniapoto. In 1899, her father instructed for her to live with a European family at Paemako near Piopio, where she started her schooling. She was unhappy with the arrangements and a year later, she moved to live with an older half-sister in Kāwhia. After breaking her arm aged nine, she returned to live with her mother, and attended Te Kuiti Native School and then Oparure Native School. She was taught the art of weaving korowai (dressed flax cloaks) by her mother. Career On 16 February 1911, she married the carpenter Tuheka Taonui Hetet at Oparure. He was descended from a French whaler. They had two children before he went to fight in World War I, and another three after his return. He was affected by gas poisoning and died suddenly in 1938. In the 1950s Hetet escalated her weaving efforts as a result of encouragement received from the Māori Women's Welfare League. From that time onward she began to regularly produce cloaks and other items. She passed her knowledge on to and helped train her daughter Diggeress Te Kanawa in the art of weaving. Hetet passed on her detailed knowledge of the different types of flax and other plants that provide the material to be weaved as well as how to produce and fix dyes to the fibres in preparation for weaving. Honours and awards Hetet was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1973 Queen's Birthday Honours, promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1984 Queen's Birthday Honours, and finally, in the 1992 Queen's Birthday Honours, elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to traditional Māori arts and crafts.

She was the first woman parliamentary reporter for a major New Zealand newspaper. Stella moved to Australia in 1903 with her husband, who became employed by the Melbourne Argus. In 1907 the newspaper commissioned Allan to write articles for the Australian Women's Work Exhibition in October, the first of its kind. She adopted the pen name \\"Vesta\\" and began writing a column for the paper called \\"Women to Women\\", spanning a whole range of women's issues and community welfare. She succeeded Ada Cambridge as president of the Women Writers' Club, and in 1912 she helped found the Lyceum Club, later becoming its president. In 1939 Henderson retired to England and wrote for The Argus on women's and children's experiences of World War II. In 1947 she returned to Melbourne and lived there until her death in 1962. Several of Henderson's siblings were also notable, Elizabeth became New Zealand's first woman Member of Parliament, and Christina was a teacher and social activist.  Early life and education  Henderson was born in Kaiapoi, North Canterbury, New Zealand on 25 October 1871. She was the seventh of nine children of Alice and Daniel Henderson. The family spent some years living in Ashburton, but when Henderson was 11 the family moved to Christchurch. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School while Helen Connon was principal, and won a Junior Scholarship to Canterbury College in 1888. She completed both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree, graduating with first class honours in English and Latin in 1893. Elizabeth Henderson in the 1890s Henderson was initially interested in a career in law, although women were not permitted to practise law at the time. With the help of William Izard, who employed her, she began working in a law firm while attending classes at Canterbury College. Izard subsequently approached the local Member of Parliament, G.W. Russell, to introduce a private member's bill to Parliament to enable women to qualify as barristers and solicitors. The legislation, the Female Law Practitioners Act, was passed in 1896 and Henderson passed her final L.L.B exams in 1898. Throughout this period, Henderson was developing her political views. She and her sisters Elizabeth and Christina joined a socialist group, as well as the National Council of Women, and signed the petition for women's suffrage that won New Zealand women the vote in 1893. All three sisters were also strong supporters of the Prohibition movement, as their father Daniel had died when the family was still young due to alcoholism.  Career  Just as Henderson was about to begin a career in law, she was offered a position as parliamentary correspondent for the Lyttelton Times newspaper. Her speeches and papers for the small political group she was involved with had been fully reported on for some time in the newspaper, and it was the editor, Samuel Saunders, who offered her the position. Saunders wrote to the president of the Press Gallery committee to inform him that the seats allocated to his newspaper in the gallery and the press room would be used by Henderson. However, the president asked the members of the gallery to vote on whether a woman should be allowed to join them, and members voted against her admittance. Unperturbed, Henderson bought a permanent ticket to the Ladies Gallery at Parliament and proceeded to write notes on her knees, write reports in the ladies tearoom, and telegraph her reports to her editor each evening. The male reporters continued to vocally oppose Henderson's presence, but her employers complained that their exclusion of her from the Press Gallery restricted their right to hire whomever they chose as their parliamentary reporter. The National Council of Women also supported Henderson; they approached the Speaker of the House, Sir Maurice O'Rorke, and pressured him to allow Henderson into the Press Gallery. After intervention from the Reporting and Debates Committee of the House, a section of the Ladies Gallery was converted into a press gallery for her use. Henderson continued to report from parliament for two years. She resigned her position on her marriage, as her new husband was a reporter for a conservative newspaper while the Lyttelton Times supported the Liberals. The couple felt they could not both continue to report for such politically opposed publications. Instead, Henderson became New Zealand correspondent for the Brisbane Courier newspaper and in 1903 the couple moved to Melbourne. The following year, Henderson began working for the paper The Argus. Initially she wrote book reviews, and in 1907 was commissioned to write a series of articles on the first Australian Women's Work Exhibition. In 1908 she began writing a weekly column called \\"Woman to Woman\\" under the pen-name \\"Vesta\\", in which she gave advice and information on community issues and women's and children's issues. Henderson also joined the Women Writers' Club there, and was one of three women founding members of the Australian Journalists' Association. In 1912 she helped found the Lyceum Club, later becoming its president. In 1939 Henderson retired to England and wrote for The Argus on women's and children's experiences of World War II. In 1947 she returned to Melbourne and lived there until her death in 1962. Vesta Place, in the Canberra suburb of Gilmore, is named in her honour.  Personal life and family  In 1900 Henderson married Edwin Frank Allan, who was a writer at the Evening Post newspaper. They had four daughters Helen Mary, Frances Elizabeth, Stella Patricia Grace and Alice Margaret.Coral Broadbent.

Early life  Henderson was born in Emerald Hill, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 15 August 1861, one of nine children of Alice and Daniel Henderson. The family moved to Kaiapoi, North Canterbury, New Zealand, and later Ashburton before settling in Christchurch. When she was young – \\"barely in her teens\\" – she became an unpaid pupil-teacher at Ashburton School. She then won a scholarship to Christchurch Normal School to continue her training. Once she had completed her certificates she was briefly headmistress of the Normal School. Henderson taught at Springston School in rural Canterbury from 1883 to 1885, and continued to study in the evenings and weekends through Canterbury College for a Bachelor of Arts degree; she graduated in 1891.  Career  From 1886 to 1912, Henderson was a staff member at Christchurch Girls' High School. She taught Latin and English and became first assistant in 1889; she also served as acting principal in 1898. Henderson was involved in a number of social justice causes. She campaigned for equal pay for women teachers from the beginning of her career, and started the Canterbury Women Teachers' Association. She fought for women's suffrage, and was a foundation member of the National Council of Women in 1896. Founded in 1901, Henderson also served as the first president of the Association of Women Teachers, aiming towards equal pay and increasing the status of female educators. She also campaigned for temperance and was involved with the Christchurch Prohibition League and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, serving as president of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU from 1926 until 1946. Influenced by her sister Alice's extensive missionary work, she was involved with the Presbyterian Women's Missionary Union of New Zealand, serving as secretary from 1917–20, and then as president from 1930–32. From 1923 until 1946, Henderson was the editor of the organisation's magazine, the Harvest Field, for more than twenty years. Furthermore, Henderson was one of New Zealand's first women Justices of the Peace. After a lifetime commitment to social reform and justice, Christina Henderson died at 92 years of age on 27 September 1953 in the Public Hospital, Christchurch.  Family  Several of Henderson's siblings were also notable – her sister Stella was a journalist and the first woman parliamentary reporter for a major New Zealand newspaper; another sister, Elizabeth, became New Zealand's first woman Member of Parliament.

Synopsis Jeb Berrier is exploring the effects of plastic bags, opting to stop using them as his wife enters pregnancy. After conducting research with the help of an environmental scientist, Berrier analyzes environmental problems such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Plastic fragments are found to outnumber plankton 60-to-1, and contributes to around 100,000 marine animal deaths, including birds, every year. Calls to the American Chemical Society prove to be fruitless. He later discovers that plastics contain chemicals such as [phthalate]s that can carry adverse effects to newborn babies, including decreased anogenital distance. Berrier reflects on the rising rates of male infertility and other such as diabetes, obesity and attention deficit disorder, linking it to the ever-present problem of plastics. The average consumer household products such as baby shampoos are also found to contain unsafe levels of phthalates. When Jeb's partner, Anne, gives birth, the film gets personal and looks at recently controversial chemicals such as Bisphenol A found in plastics. The film concludes with a review of recycling labels and shows ways that average citizens and consumers can minimize the harmful impact of plastic by reducing its use. Recycling tags The film shows that not all plastics that have recycling tags are actually recyclable. Plastics tagged as #3, #6 and #7 have low rates of recycling. Number three, polyvinyl chloride, is shown to be recycled 0% of the time. Advocacy The film's director and producer have toured California to raise awareness about a proposed state ban on plastic bags at grocery and convenience stores. Reception The film received the Best of Festival Award from the Blue Oceans Film Festival, an Audience Choice Award from the Flagstaff Mountain Film Festival, the Best Documentary Audience Award from the Ashland Independent Film Festival, the Audience Choice Award from Mountainfilm in Telluride, and second place Audience Award at the Wild & Scenic Film Festival.

Geography Golden is located at 35°16′01″N 106°12′50″W. Golden is located along the Turquoise Trail Scenic Byway and is about ten miles north of the Sandia Park junction on NM-14. History Abandoned house in Golden, New Mexico Golden was inhabited by Native Americans and Spaniards long before American settlers came to the area. However, it began to boom when gold was discovered in 1825. Years before the California and Colorado gold rushes, the site of Golden became the first gold rush west of the Mississippi River. Placer gold was first discovered on Tuerto Creek on the southwest side of the Ortiz Mountains and in the late 1820s two small mining camps, El Real de San Francisco and Placer del Tuerto, developed as a result of the mineral finds. The area remained quiet for decades until several large companies began to put money into the mines, bringing in numerous workers, and followed by many individual prospectors. It was shortly after these mining camps were formed that the San Francisco Catholic Church was built around 1830. San Francisco Catholic Church Just south of Tuerto, a new town called Golden was being formed, which soon absorbed both El Real de San Francisco and Placer del Tuerto. Officially formed in 1879, Golden was selected as the center of the new gold-mining district and soon grew to support several saloons, businesses, a school, and even a stock exchange. In 1880, the post office was opened. But mining continued on a small scale until about 1892 and ranching continued to be a mainstay of the economy. In 1918 the Golden General Merchandise Store opened, which is the only business in town that continues to operate today. It is now referred to by the locals as Henderson General Store, giving credit to its owner. By 1928, the population was so reduced that the post office closed and Golden officially became a ghost town. For years afterwards, its many abandoned buildings remained, tumbling down between its few remaining occupied structures. During this time, vandalism also took its toll on the town and its remaining structures, but a few crumbling ruins still provide excellent photo opportunities. Golden's most photographed building is the San Francisco Catholic Church, which was restored by historian and author, Fray Angelico Chavez, in 1960, while he was the padre of the St Joseph Church in Los Cerrillos. Across the highway, west of the church, are the ruins of another large structure, as well as mining remnants. Demographics Today, Golden has seen a small rebirth as new residents have moved into the area, building new homes and restoring others, but still it remains a sleepy village with vivid reminders of its more robust past. It is home to the Henderson Store, which sells Native American jewelry and pottery.

She is widely regarded as one of the top goalkeepers in the world. Early life Endler was born in Santiago, Chile, to a German father and a Chilean mother. From childhood, Endler showed talent for sports, playing tennis, swimming, hockey, basketball, volleyball and gymnastics before dedicating her full time to football. At 10 years old, she went to her first football club, Stadio Italiano, and as a teenager she attended a German high school where she started to get formal football training. Throughout her youth, she played as a forward, but when she was 15, Endler had trials with the Chile's U17 national team. Because of her height, former Chilean goalkeeper and then-coach Marco Cornez advised her to switch her position to goalkeeper. At 17 years old, she started playing semi- professionally with Unión La Calera's women's team. She spent two years with the club where she finished fifth and sixth in the league table, respectively. College career During the 2011 Pan American Games, she was recruited to play in the United States for the D1 University of South Florida Bulls. After three years of playing semi-professionally in Chile, Endler departed the country in July 2011 to attend college for two years. She was enrolled on a scholarship and at first studied physical education, but switched her major to instead study Business Administration.It was here that she learned English. In 2012, she started all 19 games and throughout the season recorded 83 saves with a .847 save percentage. She also recorded nine shutouts and was named Big East goalkeeper of the week twice and Big East freshman of the week once. In 2013 she was named to the second team for the AAC and was named AAC goalkeeper of the week three times. That same season she had a .806 save percentage and a career-high 87 saves for the season. During her fall break in 2012, Colo-Colo were playing the Copa Libertadores, so she very briefly went on loan to compete in the beginning stages of the tournament. Club career =2009-2010: Beginnings with Everton= In 2009, Endler participated in the first ever edition of the Copa Libertadores Femenina. In 2010, Endler reached her first ever Copa Libertadores final with Everton, where she would play Santos, a team that contacted her to play the year before. Everton was the first ever Chilean team to make the final of an international women's tournament. Endler held off the tournament's most effective attack for most of the match, but conceded in the 89th minute. Santos won 1-0 and took the title, their second in a row. =2011-2012: Establishing herself with Colo-Colo= In 2011, after impressing at the previous year's Copa America, she was signed to Chilean team Colo-Colo. In 2011, Endler participated in her second consecutive and Colo-Colo's first Copa Libertadores final, where they fell to São José Esporte Clube.Colo-Colo lost the women's Copa Libertadores against São José. Radio Cooperativa The following month in June, she announced her departure from Colo-Colo, opting to go to the United States and pursue a college education. In 2012, while still in college, Endler took advantage of her brief fall break to participate in her third Libertadores final in a row. Luckily for her, the match went to penalties after regulation time. Endler had anticipated the probability of a penalty shootout and reviewed strategy with her coach the day before. To end the shootout, she stopped the final penalty and won her first Copa Libertadores title. Along with Santos, Colo-Colo became the only other club to win both the Men and Women's Copa Libertadores. Chilean publication Dale Albo cites this victory as a turning point for women's football in Chile, allowing other women's clubs to establish themselves and find success in the tournament. =2014: Short-lived stint with Chelsea= In 2014, Endler was signed by Chelsea. She made her WSL Cup debut in a 1-5 win against Watford and was in goal for another WSL Cup against Millwall. Endler was having a convincing start to her season, but due to the newfound intensity of training and workouts, she began feeling discomfort in her knee that developed into a season-ending ruptured meniscus injury. Chelsea offered to extend Endler's contract, but she believed the contract didn't offer enough to sustain the expensive cost of living in England. After playing only 3 games in the WSL that season, she returned to Chile for a year to rediscover her love for football. =2015-2016: Brief return to Colo-Colo= Following her exit from England, she came back to Chile, where her options were to go to Santiago Morning or return to Colo-Colo. She ended up returning to Colo-Colo instead. It was with Colo-Colo where she regained her confidence, winning the Campeonato Apertura and returning to her fourth Copa Libertadores final in 2015. =2016-2017: Season-long stay with Valencia= The following season, she was signed by Valencia. In week 24 of the season, she was awarded player of the week for her clean sheet performance against Santa Theresa CD. By the end of the 2016-2017 season, Valencia conceded the fewest goals in the league and finished third overall, qualifying for the 2017 Copa de la Reina de Fútbol. She was awarded the Zamora Trophy for conceding only 11 goals throughout the league campaign. She was the first foreign player in the Primera División to receive the award. She also was named to La Liga's team of the season by a fan vote of 5,400. =2017-: Rise to international fame with PSG= SKN ST Pölten in the UWCL Her performances with Valencia attracted the attention of Paris Saint-Germain, and in July 2017, Endler signed a three- year contract with the French club. The transfer was Valencia's first involving money, valued at 30,000 Euros. She officially debuted in the league for PSG in a 1-0 win against ASPTT Albi. After sharing goalkeeping duties with Katarzyna Kiedrzynek for the first half of the season, she started every league game in the second half of the season. Her only loss as a starter that season came against rivals Lyon. At the end of the 2017–18 Division 1 Féminine, PSG finished second place, 8 points behind Lyon. Endler conceded just five goals and recorded seven shutouts in 11 matches for that campaign. She signed a contract extension later in 2018 that will continue on to June 2021. Endler had a decisive performance in the 2018 Coupe de France Féminine final, making important saves against Shanice van de Sanden and Dzsenifer Marozsán. PSG won the match 1-0 and earned their second ever major trophy, breaking Lyon's streak of six consecutive Coupe de France Féminine titles. This was Endler's first major professional club trophy. By the end of the 2018-2019 season, Endler conceded just 13 goals in 20 games, maintained the second-best defense in the French league, and was voted the best keeper of the French league in 2019. Their second-place league finish in 2018 meant Endler was set to make her Champion's League debut the following season. Her debut came in the Round of 32 against Austrian team SKN ST Pölten, where PSG won the match 4-1 and won the tie 6-1 on aggregate. Endler's first Champions League campaign ended in a cruel fashion, where she conceded a 91st minute goal from Maren Mjelde and lost the quarterfinal tie to her former club, Chelsea. For her performances with PSG and Chile, she received the second-most votes for 2019 The Best FIFA Goalkeeper awards behind Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal. On 9 August 2020, Endler saved a penalty from Eugénie Le Sommer during the shootout that decided the 2020 Coupe de France but subsequently missed one that she took as PSG ultimately lost to Olympique Lyon. International career =Youth teams= In 2008, Endler participated in the first ever edition of the U17 Copa America Femenina, hosted in Chile. She was a regular starter, playing all four games of Chile's campaign as they finished third in Group A with five points and exited the tournament. Endler's second international tournament experience came as a 17-year-old when Chile hosted the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. Prior to the tournament, her starting position was disputed between her and then-Colo-Colo goalkeeper Romina Parraguirre. Endler ended up establishing herself as a starter and played every minute of each of Chile's three group stage matches. Chile finished last in their group and 14th overall, but Endler impressed enough to make the Team of the Tournament. Ten years later, in an interview with FIFA, Endler said that the tournament was crucial in her decision to dedicate her life to football. Her final international youth tournament experience would come in the 2010 U20 Copa America Femenina, where Endler found greater success. She conceded just two goals in the four-round group stage as she moved onto the knockout rounds of an international tournament for the first time in her career. From there, Chile were defeated 3-1 by Brazil in the semifinals and 6-0 by Paraguay in the third place match, giving them a fourth place overall finish in the tournament. =Senior team= 2009-2016: Navigating neglect from the federation Endler's international debut for Chile's senior team came against Mexico on November 11, 2009, when she was 18. At the 2010 Copa America, Chile finished third place, their best since 1995, but still did not qualify for either the 2011 World Cup or the 2012 Olympics. They did, however, qualify for the 2011 Pan American Games. Endler won goalkeeper of the tournament. At next year's Pan American games, Endler conceded only one goal in three games, but Chile only recorded 4 points, exiting the tournament in the group stage. For the 2014 Copa America, Chile went into the tournament with zero preparation matches and subsequently finished fourth in Group B, where they did not qualify for any upcoming competitive international tournaments. Throughout the 2010s, there were many times the Chile women's national team did not have official games scheduled, prompting FIFA to deem them inactive and strip the team of their FIFA ranking. In 2011, Chile federation president Harold Mayne-Nicholls resigned, which Endler believes was a turn for the worst for women's football in Chile. His successor, Sergio Jadue, who was later banned for life by the FIFA Ethics Committee due to his participation in the 2015 FIFA corruption case, completely neglected women's football in Chile. The Chile women's national team was forced to play in \\"deplorable conditions' and train with teenage boys. Under Jadue's successor, Arturo Salah, the team received no information about new matches between 2015 and 2017. 2016-2018: Establishment of ANJUFF In 2016, Chile dropped out of the FIFA rankings again, just a year after achieving their best ranking of 41 in 2015. Former footballer and Chilean international Iona Rothfeld, Endler, and a few other Chilean teammates created the ANJUFF (Asociación Nacional de Jugadoras de Fútbol), a Chilean women's footballing union to combat neglect from their federation. ANJUFF received recognition from Chile's athletic unions and FIFPro, and was one of the first efforts to unionize female athletes in Latin America. Chile made their competitive return in May 2017, where Endler captained her side to a triumphant 12-0 win over Peru. 2018-: Chile's first Women's World Cup Chile in 2018 during a match against South Africa In 2018, thanks to the efforts of ANJUFF, Chile hosted the 2018 Copa América Femenina. Endler captained her side to a second-place finish in Group A, only letting in 2 goals in 5 games. In the final stage, Chile came in second behind Brazil, becoming runners-up in the tournament and qualifying them for their first ever FIFA Women's World Cup. With this finish, Chile would be also be given the chance to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in a CAF-CONMEBOL qualification playoff. Endler has criticized the CONMEBOL qualifying format, where the quadrennial competition determines qualification for three separate competitions- the FIFA Women's World Cup, the Olympics, and the Pan-American Games. At the 2019 Women's World Cup, Endler was the captain and highest capped player on Chile's roster. She played every minute of Chile's three group stage matches, making thirteen total saves. In the second group match, Chile played number 1 ranked USWNT who had twenty-six attempts on goal and 9 on target throughout the match. Endler made six saves and despite conceding three goals, her performances against the eventual tournament winners earned herself a Player of the Match award and garnered international attention. In the final match of the group stage with Round of 16 qualification on the line, Chile played Thailand who, a week before, suffered the highest ever margin of defeat in a World Cup tournament, men or women. Endler recorded a shutout in that match, helping her team to their first ever win in a World Cup tournament. Chile finished third in Group F and very narrowly exited the tournament by not having enough points nor a high enough goal-difference to be one of the third placed teams that could qualify for the Round of 16. Endler questioned Chile coach José Letelier's decisions in the match against Thailand, saying in a post-match interview that she expected players with more experience to get more game time. In September of 2019, Endler won her first title with Chile, the 2019 Torneo Internacional Femenino de Sao Paulo friendly championship. In the final, they drew Brazil in extra time and defeated them on penalties, where Endler saved the first penalty, missed a penalty that she took, and then saved another. This was Chile's first time in 13 matches against Brazil where they didn't lose. Endler did not concede a single goal throughout the tournament. Style of play In the official FIFA report for the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup she was listed as one of Chile's standout players, describing her as a \\"complete, solid all- round goalkeeper with commanding presence, good basic technique who starts build-up play quickly.\\" After her performance against the USWNT, well- respected American soccer journalist Grant Wahl called her performance \\"astonishing,\\" saying that \\"Christen Press will see (Endler) in her nightmares.\\" Former United States goalkeeper Hope Solo described her as \\"spectacular,\\" \\"one-in-a-million,\\" and \\"strong, powerful and quick with excellent positioning ...her ability to read the aerial balls is also top notch. She is a complete goalkeeper.\\" Personal life Endler holds both Chilean and German citizenship, and can speak Spanish, Portuguese, English, German and a bit of French. Due to her father's German heritage, her hero and idol as a child was German footballer and former Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. She also admired Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas. She cites her biggest inspiration as her brother, who instilled a passion for football in her since a young age and pushed her to become a goalkeeper. Endler has expressed her support for the 2019–20 Chilean protests, saying on Instagram that she was \\"proud to see it.\\" Honors =Club= Everton * Copa Chile: Winner-2010 * Copa Libertadores Femenina: Runner-up- 2010 Colo- Colo * Chilean League Apertura: Winner- 2011, 2015 * Chilean League Clausura: Winner- 2011, 2012 * Copa Libertadores Femenina: Runner-up- 2011, 2015, Winner, 2012 Paris-Saint Germain * Division 1 Féminine: Runner- up- 2017-18, 2018-19 * Coupe de France Féminine: Winner- 2018 =Country= * Copa América Femenina: Runner-up- 2018 * Torneo Internacional Femenino de Sao Paulo: Runner-up- 2013, Winner- 2019 =Individual= Endler in 2017 holding her award for the Best Chilean Women's Player * American Athletic Conference Second Team: 2013 * FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup All-Star Team: 2008 * Copa América Femenina Goalkeeper of the Tournament: 2010 * Copa Libertadores Femenina Goalkeeper of the Tournament: 2011 * Zamora Trophy: Winner- 2017 * ANFP Chilean Footballer of the Year: Winner- 2008, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 * Division 1 Féminine Goalkeeper of the Season: Winner- 2018-19 * The Best FIFA Goalkeeper: Finalist- 2019 =Awards and recognition= In 2018, Endler was named to The Guardian's list of top 100 women footballers in the world for the first time, ranking at 52 as the second-best goalkeeper on the list. The same year, the IFFHS voted her as the sixth-best goalkeeper in the world. For her outstanding play against the United States during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, she was voted Player of the Match. Following the match, legendary goalkeeper Hope Solo went on record to say that Endler \\"sets the bar very high\\" and \\"she shows what goalkeeping should be.\\" She also referred to a quote made by Chelsea coach Emma Hayes that women should have smaller pitches and goals. Solo cited Endler as an example of why that sentiment is \\"unbelievable.\\" Former USMNT defender Alexi Lalas titled her \\"the best in the world.\\" Paraguay goalkeeper José Luis Chilavert also acclaimed Endler as the best female goalkeeper in the world, praising her charisma, confidence and leadership. Later in the year, she was voted the fifth-best women's goalkeeper of 2019 by IFFHS, behind Sari van Veenendaal, Sarah Bouhaddi, Alyssa Naeher and Hedvig Lindahl. In their brief profile of her, IFFHS predicted that she had the potential to be the best goalkeeper in the world in later years. Endler was also a nominee for the 2019 FIFPRO FIFA Women's World 11. In 2019, The Guardian listed her as the twenty-fourth best player and second-best goalkeeper in the world in their annual list of the top 100 players, going up 28 ranks from the previous year's list.

Their center of diversity is around the western Mediterranean, extending into the Atlantic coasts of Portugal and Morocco. Some species are used in traditional medicine. Description Species of Thapsia are herbaceous perennials, growing 50 to 200 cm high. The inflorescences are large, regularly distributed umbels. The seeds have four wings, and are the main characteristic of the genus, which is distributed in the Mediterranean, on the Iberian peninsula, and North Africa. The generic name Thapsia is derived from the Ancient Greek name θαψία (thapsía) for the members of the genus. The Greeks believe it to have originated from ancient Thapsos in Sicily. It has a long history of being used in ancient traditional medicine. Algerians used it as a pain-reliever though they recognized that the plant was deadly to camels. The Greek colony of Cyrene exported a medicinal plant known as silphion, used as a purgative and emetic. Although its exact identity remains contentious today, some historians believe that the plant may have been Thapsia garganica. Cancer research The chemical compound thapsigargin has been isolated from Thapsia garganica. A synthetic prodrug of thapsigargin called \\"G-202\\" is in preliminary clinical trials for cancer treatment. The active constituent kills tumor cells by destroying their calcium balance. A biotech company called GenSpera, Inc. in San Antonio, TX is studying methods of delivering thapsigargin directly to cancer cells, avoiding damage to other cells in the body of the patient. Species About 21 species of Thapsia are currently recognized.

After the Greek victory in Himara, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, admitted that one of the causes of the Italian defeat was the high morale of the Greek troops. Background The Italian Army, initially deployed on the Greek–Albanian border, launched a major offensive against Greece on 28 October 1940. After a two-week conflict, Greece managed to repel the invading Italians in the battles of Pindus and Elaia–Kalamas. Beginning on 9 November, the Greek forces launched a counteroffensive and penetrated deep into Italian-held Albanian territory all over the front. As a result, the Greek forces entered the cities and towns of the region one after another: Korçë, on 22 November, Pogradec, on 30 November, Sarandë, on 6 December and Gjirokastër, on 8 December. Battle Italian POW, December 1940 On 13 December, Porto Palermo, a coastal village south of Himara came under the control of the Greek forces. Two days later, the Greek 3rd Infantry Division continued the offensive toward Himara. However, the advance was slowed due to heavy enemy counter-action, supported by air force raids, as well as extremely harsh weather conditions. On 19 December, the Greek forces after a hard fight captured the Giami height. Meanwhile, at the dawn of same day, the 3/40 Evzone Regiment (Colonel Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos) launched, without artillery preparation, a surprise attack against the Italian troops at Mount Mali i Xhorët (or Mount Pilur), a strategic spot east of Himara. The Evzones of the regiment, after being informed about the topography of the region by locals, performed a charge with fixed bayonets from various positions against the Italian garrison. The snow was high, which helped the advancing Greek troops to cross barbed wire and capture an Italian mountain battery. After three days of fierce fighting, the men of the 3rd Division took control of the height, as well as the Kuç saddle. The capture of Kuç saddle gave access to the valley of Shushicë. Furthermore, the Italian troops lost six artillery guns, a mortar company and a multitude of war supplies. The Greek losses did not exceed 100 killed in action and wounded, while the Italians had approximately 400 casualties and more than 900 were taken prisoner. On 21 December, the Greek forces captured the height of Tsipista north-west of Himara. To avoid encirclement, the Italians abandoned Himara. Finally, the Greek troops entered the town in the morning on 22 December, where they were welcomed by the locals with enthusiastic celebrations. Aftermath The capture of Himara was celebrated as a major success in Greece and proved that the Greek army was in condition to continue the advance pushing the Italians further north. On the other hand, the Italian headquarters was alarmed by the Greek success, and on 24 December Benito Mussolini addressed his concerns to the Italian military commander, Ugo Cavallero. In his letter, Mussolini does not doubt that one of the causes of the Italian defeat was the high morale of the Greek forces, which led to their capture of Himara.

The hotel's motto is \\"Arizona's mile high historic landmark\\" History =Founded as the United Verde Hospital= The Jerome Grand Hotel was originally constructed in 1926 under the name United Verde Hospital, owned by the United Verde Copper Company (UVCC), later to become Phelps Dodge Mining Corporation. Some knew it as the Phelps Dodge Hospital and United Verde Copper Hospital. It was the 4th and final hospital in Jerome. Opened in January 1927, the United Verde Hospital was a state-of-the-art medical facility; in 1930, listed as the most modern and well equipped hospital in Arizona and possibly in all of the western states. The hospital, however was closed in 1950, as the mining operations began shutting down and medical services were available in the neighboring community of Cottonwood, where many of the staff transferred to. The building stood unused for the next 44 years. =As the Jerome Grand Hotel= The former hospital was purchased by Larry Altherr from Phelps Dodge Mining Corporation in 1994, and was renamed the Jerome Grand Hotel, opening for business in 1996. Larry Altherr remains the owner. Structure The Jerome Grand Hotel is well noted to be the highest commercial building in the Verde Valley, being at a height of 5240 feet above sea level. The hotel was built as a Mission Revival Style of architecture and was the last major building to be constructed in Jerome. The building was considered by many a masterpiece of architecture because, not only was it constructed of poured-in- place concrete, but also at a 50 degree slope on solid bedrock, up against the slopes of Mingus Mountain. The 30,000 square foot building was designed to be fireproof-not one piece of wood is in the framework-and also earthquake proof, as it needed to withstand not only the rumblings of Mother Nature but also the blasts of 260,000 pounds of dynamite. The Otis Elevator and the Kewanee Boiler The Otis Elevator, which was Arizona's first self-service elevator, was installed in the United Verde Hospital in 1926 and serves all five floors of the building. The elevator is regularly maintained and inspected, insuring safety for public use. This Otis elevator is different from modern elevators because, designed for hospital use, it travels much more slowly, at a distance of only 50 feet per minute, rather than the normal 800 feet per minute found on high rise buildings. The caste iron Kewanee Boiler, which was also installed in 1926, provides low pressure steam throughout the building. The Kewanee boiler, designed to not only be portable but also convertible, could operate on wood, coal or oil. When in use during the hospital days, the source was oil and has since been converted to operate using natural gas, producing between 800,000 and 2,500,000 BTUs. The Kewanee Boiler also utilizes a dual pump feature, so it need not be shut off for maintenance nor repair, insuring consistent pressure and warmth throughout the building. Hauntings While it operated as the United Verde Hospital and later became the Jerome Grand Hotel, many alleged hauntings have occurred. According to ghostlyfavorites.com., \\"Due to the high level of activity in the hotel, it is a quite popular destination for amateur ghost hunters\\". Guests that have stayed at the hotel reported to hear coughing, labored breathing, and even voices coming from empty rooms. Guests also reported smells coming from rooms, such as flowers, dust, cigar smoke, and whiskey. Others report light anomalies and the television sets turning themselves on with no explanation. Many guests and hotel staff have heard and seen what appears to be a 4 or 5 year old child running down the hallway on the 3rd floor, sometimes crying or laughing. This child also likes to appear at the foot of the bed in various rooms, just staring at the bed's occupant. Frequently, the sounds of giggling and running occur on the top floor, as though children are at play. The sounds of a newborn baby's cry is common on the 3rd and 4th floors, as well as the faint smell of baby powder and zinc oxide. The baby's crying has alerted enough guests that they've phoned the front desk out of concern; the location being a vacant room. Staff as well as guests frequently report bedside table lamps and televisions being unplugged, shampoo bottles rolling across the floor or flying across the room. The sound of doors opening/closing while the room is otherwise vacant are common. Guests have found electronics such as cell phones and camcorders dead center beneath the bed. Front Desk staff, particularly the graveyard shift, have reported hearing coughing and sneezing from the hotel's laundry room, seeing shadows in the same area of whom they believe to be Claude Harvey, the hospital's maintenance man who was found dead on April 3, 1935, pinned beneath the Otis elevator, presumably murdered. They see and hear Claude roaming the stairwells and the boiler room as though still at work. Many guests have reported seeing the apparitions of two ladies, one in a white gown, and another one in a nurse's outfit, as well as someone who appears to be a doctor or nurse in a long lab coat carrying a clipboard, roaming the halls. A Spirit Cat is a frequent visitor to the hotel. Its origin unknown, the cat has been heard meowing, hissing and scratching at doors and walls. Both staff and guests have heard and felt the cat brushing against their legs and snuggling against them while on the bed. Most notable and commonplace is the imprint on the bedding of what is believed to be the cat curled up, that bedding moments earlier, smooth and straight. A photo, provided by a guest staying in Rm 20 in 2008, shows the cat very clearly sitting on a table, looking toward the photographer. This photo is still at the front desk along with numerous photos shared by guests and staff. During its hospital days, many deaths occurred from illness or injury, but also some rather suspicious in origin, like that of maintenance man Claude Harvey. Claude was found pinned by the back of the neck by the elevator, quite dead. A thorough inspection of the elevator was done, as well as a coroner's inquest, that determined the elevator could not have caused Claude's death. No autopsy was allowed to be performed, nor x-ray taken, as the United Verde Copper Company, who owned the building, did not want suspicion pointing in their direction as accident nor intent. Claude's is the only death in the hospital whose cause has yet to be determined. Speculation is, Mr. Harvey was murdered and his body placed in the elevator room, with his head hanging over the elevator shaft, to look like an accident. Only one other known death since the hospital closed down in 1950, that of Manoah Hoffpauir, a local man hired by Phelps Dodge Mining Company to be a presence in the vacant building, hoping to offset the years of vandalism. Manoah was found hanging from a steam pipe in the Engineer's Office, where he resided while serving as the caretaker. His death in 1982 was ruled a suicide. During its days as the United Verde Hospital, an estimated 9000 deaths occurred, however no known records are present, so that number has yet to be validated. When purchased in 1994 by Larry Altherr, the hospital records were gone, so any information regarding staff and patients is via word-of-mouth, with little or no verification. The hospital was a general surgical hospital, meeting the needs of all who entered; unlike the name of the resident restaurant, a separate business from the hotel named Asylum, the building was never an insane asylum nor exclusive for tuberculosis patients. The hotel was investigated by the Ghost Adventures reality paranormal TV show as well as others. Due to the extreme privacy the hotel wishes to provide its guests, private tours have been discontinued and no one other than registered guests and staff are permitted on the guest floors. The lobby (former emergency room) is open to the public 24/7 and the Asylum Restaurant (admitting and dispensary) is open to the public 11am-9pm daily. A complete history, photos and online booking is available via the hotel's website: www.jeromegrandhotel.net. The hotel is open 365 days a year.

The third book in the series, Ignite Me, was published on February 4, 2014. The fourth book, \\"Restore Me,\\" was published on March 6, 2018. Film rights for Shatter Me were optioned by 20th Century Fox in 2011, prior to the book's release date. Of her inspirations for the work, Mafi has stated that she drew inspiration from \\"an interest in human nature and [humanity's] ability to overcome great obstacles\\". Plot Shatter Me follows the narrative of Juliette Ferrars, a 17-year-old girl with a paralyzing and killing touch. She can take living organisms' energy. The book starts out with Juliette in an asylum due to the fact that she murdered a small boy three years prior, in a store, using her unusual touch. It is evident that Juliette is partly insane, both from isolation and at horror at herself. She also dreams of a bird. She writes in a small notebook to convey her feelings as she has no one to talk to. Soon, she gets a cellmate, for the first time ever, who goes by the name of Adam Kent. He reminds Juliette of someone, but she convinces herself that it is not possible that she ever knew him. She shows Adam the ways of the asylum, such as not to eat the scalding food immediately, and when the asylum's occupants are allowed to shower. At some point, Juliette wakes up to find Adam has touched her, she becomes confused. One day, the Reestablishment, a government that has the world within its grasp, comes for Juliette. It is revealed that Adam is a soldier for Aaron Warner, the leader of Sector 45 of the Reestablishment. Warner, who is also the son of the Reestablishment's Supreme Commander, makes Juliette an offer that includes her being able to get out of the asylum in turn for her torturing any prisoners with her touch. Warner wants to use her as a weapon for the Reestablishment. Warner forces Juliette to torture a soldier named Jenkins and then a small child through a simulated torture room because she refused to touch Warner. He wanted to feel the full effects of her power, but she refused to touch him, claiming that she would hurt him. During her captivity, Juliette develops a romantic relationship with Adam, and we learn that Adam knew Juliette prior to the asylum, and is in love with her. We also learn that Adam can touch Juliette without being harmed or killed. Adam eventually helps Juliette escape from Warner, and as they escape, Warner's hand brushes against Juliette's ankle, which shows us that Warner also can touch Juliette without consequence. Adam and Juliette run away to where Adam's 10-year-old brother James lives, a small apartment Adam helped to make. James is taken care of by others due to the fact that Adam has to live with the other soldiers and to the brother's knowledge, both of their parents are dead. One of Adam's fellow soldiers, Kenji Kishimoto, shows up claiming that Warner had him tortured in order to learn Adam and Juliette's whereabouts. Kenji says that he knows a safe place where they can escape, and they formulate a plan. Juliette and Adam split up with Kenji and James. While split up, Adam and Juliette are captured, and Warner shoots Adam. Warner drags Juliette into an abandoned classroom and tells Juliette he loves her. Warner kisses Juliette, so she seduces him to get the gun from him. She shoots him, just enough to keep him down for a while. She finds Adam in a slaughterhouse, and they escape, although Adams's leg is badly injured. They meet up with Kenji and James, whom Kenji had given sedatives to avoid James becoming traumatized by the condition Adam is in. At the end of the book, it is revealed that Kenji is a member of the Rebellion against the Reestablishment, called Omega Point. Adam, Juliette, and James are recruited by, and then join the Rebellion. There are five other books in the series: Unravel Me, Ignite Me, Restore Me, Defy Me, and Imagine Me (in that order). Imagine Me concludes the series. Reception Reviews for Shatter Me have been mixed, with many reviewers stating criticisms while overall recommending the work. Kirkus Reviews praised Shatter Me for its love story, but said that the ending \\"falls flat\\" and that there was an \\"overreliance on metaphor\\". Publishers Weekly cited that while the book \\"doesn’t escape some rookie pitfalls,\\" author Tahereh Mafi \\"combines a psychological opener with an action-adventure denouement in her YA debut,\\" ultimately calling it \\"a gripping read from an author who’s not afraid to take risks\\".Children's Review: Shatter Me Publishers Weekly Booklist gave a mixed review, noting that there were \\"plot conveniences and melodramatic writing to spare\\" while praising it for its \\"rip-roaring adventure and steamy romance scenes\\". A youth reviewer for the National Post recommended it highly, stating that it had \\"just the right amount of action to make it thrilling, but not exactly gruesome.\\" It was included in BuzzFeed's list of best YA books of all time. =Awards= *Honorable Mention: Children/Young Adult at the Arab American Book Awards Characters *Juliette Ferrars: Juliette starts off as a scared, traumatized 17-year-old girl, having been abused, locked away, and made to feel like a monster her entire life. She struggles to trust others and has trouble making friends, due to her lethal touch. Throughout the series, she learns to control her powers and becomes more brave and confident thanks to the help of training at Omega Point. Despite being friendless for most of her life, Juliette is compassionate and kind, and easily sympathizes with those who are vulnerable. Juliette can also easily be influenced and manipulated and has fluctuating confidence. *Aaron Warner: 19-year-old leader of Sector 45 in the Reestablishment; shown as a very cold and manipulative person. Warner gradually changes into a more loving human being as the books progress. He has blond hair and green eyes and is considered inhumanly handsome. From the beginning of the series, he is desperately in love with Juliette, which for a while was an obsession. Juliette develops empathy for Warner, despite him seeming cold and ruthless, and asserts he is a normal human, despite his denials. He is known to always assume the worst of himself. He can touch Juliette without consequence. *Adam Kent: A soldier in the army, 18 years old; he is in charge of Juliette after she is brought out of isolation. He is known as a handsome man with blue eyes, tattoos, and dark brown hair. He is shown to be in love with Juliette since they first saw/met each other, as children. He can touch Juliette by using his powers but it is extremely draining and sometimes painful for him. *Kenji Kishimoto: A 20-year-old soldier in Warner's army who is friends with Adam. He is later found out to be a member of Omega Point and is shown to have the gift of invisibility. He has a very joking personality and is a very chill person. He is also very egotistical and that adds humor to his person. He is also known to develop an admiration for Juliette which she returns and they form a strong bond, as best friends, almost like siblings. *James Kent: Adam's 10-year-old younger brother. He is extremely mature for his age. He is very intuitive and curious to the world around him. He greatly admires Adam. *Castle: Leader of the Rebellion (Omega Point). Castle is a thirty-year-old scientist with telekinetic powers. He is portrayed as a wise, fair and compassionate person.

In 1971, he became the first person to traverse the Northwest Passage in anything other than a ship. Dauksza completed the 3,200-mile journey over the course of six summers on a solo canoe expedition. Early years A native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was the captain of the Union High School football team that won the state championship in 1931. Dauksza attended Michigan State University where he played for the football team. He was an offensive and defensive lineman for the Spartans as well as a punter and placekicker (1932-1933). He sometimes has been confused with Antone \\"Tony\\" Dauksza, his cousin, who played as a quarterback for the 1933 National Champions Michigan Wolverines. Antone \\"Tony\\" Dauksza was also from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Antone Dauksza later changed his name to Antone \\"Tony\\" Dicks to avoid confusion with his cousin who played at Michigan State and was a photographer, film maker, adventurer/explorer of the Alaskan and Yukon Territories. Outdoorsman and film-maker In the 1930s, Dauksza began a lifetime as an outdoorsman and explorer. Starting with an interest in fishing and hunting, he began canoeing in 1936. He made regular summer expeditions into Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, and Alaska. He eventually converted his love of the outdoors into his full-time occupation, exploring in the summers and conducting film-lectures in the winter. In the fall of 1959, Dauksza attracted the attention of a reporter for the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix as he passed through Saskatoon in his Volkswagen van (dubbed the \\"Volksbeast\\") bearing \\"a set of rare double-browed Caribou antlers of 393 points and a set of 63-1/2-inch moose antlers as well as several lesser trophies.\\" The reporter published a feature story about Dauksza's adventures hunting, fishing, and filming for his \\"Alaska Adventure Movies\\" enterprise. A story on his adventures also appeared in the October 1959 issue of Outdoor Life magazine. In 1964, he canoed 300 miles from Great Slave Lake to the Mackenzie River delta. The Arctic Ocean was iced in by the time he arrived, and Dauksza was forced to walk to an Eskimo camp. In 1965, he became the first person to canoe down the East Calendar River from the Brooks Range in northeastern Alaska. The 300-mile journey included 200 miles of white water. Dauksza recalled, \\"I'd just get through one rapid and I'd hear the roar of the next. There was barely time enough between rapids to bale [sic].\\" The Detroit Free Press in 1969 called Dauksza a latter-day Daniel Boone. From 1966 to 1971, he completed a 3,200-mile solo canoe journey through the Northwest Passage. He was the first one-man expedition in the smallest craft to navigate the passage. Dauksza began the journey in 1966 at Point Barrow, Alaska. That summer, he canoed 600 miles to Barter Island in a 16-foot aluminum canoe that he called \\"The Arctic Ice Cube.\\" He traveled with a small igloo tent, a Winchester rifle, a movie camera, and a three-horsepower engine to help him traverse the most difficult passages. In the fall of 1966, The Canadian Press published a story referring to his expedition as a \\"suicidal mission.\\" Dauksza reported that his wife had accepted him as a \\"hopeless case\\" and was content to have him home in Grand Rapids in the winters where he conducted film- lectures on his adventures at churches, schools and clubs throughout Michigan and Indiana. He returned in 1967 and was forced to backtrack to the west due to heavy ice drift. In 1968, he made it back to Barter Island. In 1969, he switched to a 19-foot aluminum canoe equipped with a four horsepower engine that he called \\"The Arctic Icebreaker.\\" Dauksza had engine trouble and was blown out to sea where he drifted for three days. He experienced a close call in 1970 when he broke through the ice while dragging his canoe across an ice flow. By the end of the summer of 1970, he made it to Spence Bay. In the summer of 1971, Time-Life Broadcasts supplied him with filming equipment to document the last leg of his journey. He was iced in for 12 days but managed to complete the journey, traveling from Spence Bay to Bellot Strait east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago at the tip of Boothia Peninsula. Interviewed in 1972 by The Christian Science Monitor, Dauksza explained that he loved the quiet of the Arctic's enormous desolation. He lived off caribou, duck, goose and fish on his journey. He was once forced to shoot a grizzly bear that he said mistook him for a caribou. He reported having no problems with wolves: \\"The wolf - if you allowed him, shucks, he'd be your friend. I woke once and saw one just sitting there observing me like a dog.\\" Interviewed in 1974 by The Canadian Press, Dauksza explained the attraction he felt for the Arctic: \\"People in the North are the way people should be everywhere, and the way they would be if they didn't live in cities. It's the people, and a curiosity I have always had about remote areas that makes me want to see the Arctic.\\" Death Dauksza died on Christmas Day 1996 at Grand Rapids, Michigan.Death record for Anthony Dauksza, Michigan Department of Vital and Health Records.

Until May 2011 the interviews were also shown as a web series at 3min.de, a video-sharing site of Deutsche Telekom. The movie was mainly shot in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and New York.Cf. review in De:Bug magazine.  Structure  The documentary starts with a short prologue (Niermann taking a bath in the Schlachtensee lake in Berlin), followed by the actual interviews which are divided into four main chapters: :I. Investigation :II. Creation :III. Incubation :IV. Presentation In the interview series, the focus is on how the art business works and how an artist can be successful and create a lasting work of art. In the course of the film, Niermann develops the idea for an epochal work of art in an exemplary manner. Niermann then develops the concept of a pyramid. The pyramid would be peeled out of a mountain or hill several hundred meters high. The work would be financed by a collector who would then be buried inside the pyramid thus created. After the death of the collector, the demolished material must be piled up again. The pyramid is to disappear. The film ends at the Wachsenburg in Thuringia. Niedling and Niermann present their idea to the lord of the castle. They ask how much a collector would have to pay to have the castle temporarily pulled down and then the pyramid peeled out of the mountain as planned.

It was led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn (1610–1664), who was given command of the Royalist forces in Scotland by Charles II. Initially successful it began to suffer divisions when John Middleton arrived to replace Glencairn as commander, resulting in a series of duels between officers. It was defeated when Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654. Although the rising was unsuccessful it forced a change of policy by the Cromwellian regime, which now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. Origins William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn was given command of the Royalist forces in Scotland by Charles II. He convened a meeting of Scottish notables at Lochearn in August 1653. Among those present were John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Archibald Campbell, eldest son of the Marquis of Argyll, Lord Loin, Donald MacDonell of Glengarry, Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, John Graham of Duchray and Colonel Blackadder of Tullyallan. These notables then mustered their vassals and supporters to form a small army of about 60 horse, and a force of foot, made up of 60–80 Lowlanders and 150 Highlanders. The governor of Stirling Castle, Colonel Kidd, sallied out to suppress this force, but was defeated at Aberfoyle.S. C. Manganiello, The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639–1660 (Scarecrow Press, 2004), , pp. 223–5. This victory boosted morale and the rising gained some support from Lowland Scottish lords, forcing the Commonwealth government to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to these groups.B. Coward, The Cromwellian Protectorate (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), , p. 148. Divisions William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn, leader of the major armed resistance to the Commonwealth regime in Scotland Although it gained recruits, the rising began to suffer from internal divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made up the bulk of the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, John Middleton (1608–1674), a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II.M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Random House, 1991), , pp. 284–5. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. Divisions were largely due to petty disputes between Glencairn's and Middleton's respective forces. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide, insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel between Glencairn and Munro in which the latter was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. The following day two junior officers from the two camps had a duel of their own in which one was killed and the other was later arrested and hanged. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign for the remainder of the rising. Defeat Middleton adopted a strategy of raid and harrying. Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption, it soon began to prove counter-productive, as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment. With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch, Monck began a campaign against the rising, making forced marches of between 12 and 20 miles a day in difficult terrain. On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal. In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands. The end of the Dutch War meant there was no possibility of foreign aid and government reinforcements were now available to combat the rising. As a result the Royalist military effort petered out. Eventually, Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile. Consequences Although the rising was unsuccessful it forced a change of policy by the regime, which instead of attempting to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would be seized, and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of those names were treated with leniency and fines were remitted for confiscations, or were reduced, and some were abandoned.D. L.

Horse racing Hazlett was involved in horse racing from an early age, and in later years was far better known through this part of his life than for his rugby exploits. Amongst New Zealand's leading owners for many years, and topping the table six times, he became the first (and so far only) New Zealander to win more than 1,000 races as an owner.

He was born in Wellington, New Zealand on 19 January 1900. Career Hayes did not have any formal qualifications, however he began work at the Dominion Observatory, Wellington (then named the Hector Observatory) in 1920. The observatory was responsible for maintaining the New Zealand Government Time Service. Hayes was trained in the astronomical observations necessary to keep the clocks accurate. Some of his initial work also involved working on the seismograph that the observatory inherited from seismologist George Hogben. Hayes became acting-director of the observatory after Charles Edward Adams retired from the position in 1936. He was acting- director for 12 years before the position was formalised. One of the contributions Hayes had while at the Observatory was the application of the Richter scale in New Zealand. He was in communication with Charles Francis Richter who had been developing the scale; and by using the same Wood-Anderson type seismographs that Richter used, was able to apply it to earthquakes in New Zealand. Hayes was also interested on the research being done in the area of deep-focus earthquakes. This subsequently lead to his own research on seismic waves and the conclusion that New Zealand was on the continental side of the crust near to the boundary between continental and oceanic crust. He also confirmed the occurrence of deep-focus earthquakes in new Zealand. In 1975, in recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the Hector Medal. Personal life Hayes was born in Wellington on 19 January 1900, to Robert Edward Hayes and Ellen Thomas. He was educated in Wellington before attending Christ's College in Christchurch from 1914 to 1918. Hayes married Margaret Wyn Beere on 1 December 1932, they had two daughters.

D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated in the range of 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney- shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The sprung governor was also unusual with a throw- yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburetor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves. The D-400 engines are now a popular engine restoration job due to their distinctive shape and low cost. Parts, however can be difficult to source and therefore multiple engines are often bought to satisfy part requirements. The recommended oil:fuel mix is either 16:1 or 32:1 depending on age.

Awarded the Order of the Red Banner after destroying a German tank, Onilova was mortally wounded in a German attack during the Battle of Sevastopol. She was posthumously awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin in 1965. Early life Nina Onilova was born in 1921 near Odessa, a daughter of Ukrainian peasants and was brought up at an Odessa orphanage after her parents' death. She was a member of the Komsomol and joined the workforce as a textile factory worker before World War II.Downing, David (2009). Sealing Their Fate: The Twenty-Two Days That Decided World War II. Philadelphia: Da Capo Press. pp. 85-86. . Onilova developed an interest in gunnery after attending a screening of Chapayev, a popular 1930s film based on the life of Russian Civil War commander Vasily Chapayev that starred Varvara Myasnikova as Anka, a courageous woman machine gunner, and took gunnery training lessons from her factory's paramilitary training club.  Military career  The armies of Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Onilova volunteered for service in the Red Army when the Siege of Odessa commenced in August 1941. She was originally made a medic in 54th Rifle Regiment in the 25th Rifle Division of the Separate Coastal Army, but soon used her prewar training to prove herself as a gunner when she picked up her comrades' jammed machine gun, quickly cleared it, and used it to repulse a detachment of advancing Germans. Onilova was badly wounded as the Germans continued their siege in September 1941, but chose to remain with her unit when it subsequently fell back to positions around Sevastopol alongside the rest of the Coastal Army in preparation for the German assault on the Crimean Peninsula and the city of Sevastopol, a Crimean port used as a strategic naval base used by the Black Sea Fleet. Onilova took part in the defense of Sevastopol at the village of Mekenziya, about seven miles east of the city center. In November 1941, she crawled across twenty-five yards of open ground to destroy a German tank with two Molotov cocktails, for which she was promoted to sergeant and awarded the Order of the Red Banner. A machine gun crew commander and senior sergeant by spring 1942, Onilova was seriously wounded for the second time during a German attack on Mekenziya on 1 March 1942, in which she singlehandedly fought on after the rest of the gun crew were killed. Taken to a Soviet hospital in the aftermath, she spent her time drafting an unfinished letter to Myasnikova about herself on the spare pages of a school notebook she had brought with her. She died on 8 March 1942 at age twenty, and was interred at Sevastopol's Communards Cemetery.

Only the Paris school is older, but the Royal School for the Blind is the oldest school in the world in continuous operation, and the first in the world founded by a blind person, Edward Rushton, who was also an anti-slavery campaigner.Royden Mike, Edward Rushton, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2001). Unsung: life story of Edward Rushton. http://historyof.place/unsung-remembering- edward-rushton/ It was also the first school in the world to offer education and training to blind adults as well as children.The Blind in British Society: Charity, State and Community c1780-1930 Gordon Phillips, 2004 Ashgate Publishing Ltd. alt=  Early history  The first building to be used by the school was quite unsuitable. Situated at 6 Commutation Row, Liverpool, opposite the potteries of Shaw's Brow (now William Brown Street), two houses recently erected were rented by the charity for the sole use of the school. They were much too small and by 1800 enough money had been raised to erect a purpose built school nearby on the site later occupied by the Odeon cinema on London Road. Designed by John Foster junior (later Architect & Surveyor to Liverpool Corporation) the school was now well and truly established and would stay on this site for the next 50 years. The new Blind School drawn in 1805 In 1806 during a royal visit to Liverpool by the Prince of Wales (later George IV) and the Duke of Clarence (later William IV), the royal entourage visited the School for the Blind, where they met pupils and inspected some of the manufactured goods on show. After being entertained by the choir of the school singing the 'Halleluiah Chorus', the Prince ordered 10 guineas to be distributed among the pupils and bestowed 100 guineas on the school as well as his royal patronage which has continued unbroken to the present day. Chapel of the Royal School for the Blind, Liverpool 1829 The gift was a great boost to the Institution which was raising funds to extend the site. Architect John Foster was again engaged, and land to the rear of the building was secured and building began on new facilities in 1807. Completed in 1812, 53 males and 18 females moved into the buildings which were now fully residential, with work rooms, technical facilities and music rooms. The mission of the school guardians was that the institution would be 'less of an asylum, where the ease a comfort of the blind were principally considered, and more approaching a school, where pupils could be instructed in some useful art or trade, by which they might be enabled to procure for themselves a comfortable livelihood.' The Hardman Street Royal School for the Blind, Liverpool 1851 and transferred Chapel In 1819 a chapel was opened by the school on adjoining land, with a connecting tunnel for the pupils to avoid the road and traffic above. John Foster was asked to draw up plans and being fresh from a tour of Greece and the islands, the classical influence was captured in the Doric frontage to the building. This influence would be carried over into other local building during his career as the city architect. Royal School for the Blind, Liverpool - Wavertree building opened 1898 As Lime Street Station began to expand at the height of 'Railway Mania', pressure was being brought to bear on the owners of local properties and the school guardians began to make plans to move once more. The L.N.W.R. agreed in 1849 to exchange land they held in Hope Street and Hardman Street, plus the sum of £9,500 for the entire estate adjoining Lime Street Station owned by the school. A further £2,000 was given to the school for the chapel and its removal. This was to entail the transfer of the chapel to the new site on the corner block of Hope Street and Hardman Street where it was re-erected in its entirety, apart from its front steps, the local council refusing to grant the necessary space. The new school building, designed by Arthur Hill Holme, and erected alongside the chapel facing Hardman Street, opened in 1851, with eighty-five pupils. With the passing of the Elementary Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act in 1893, the Hardman Street School could not provide the required facilities laid down by the new legislation. Thanks to Mary Louisa Hornby, who was a major benefactor, Wavertree Hall was purchased in Church Road, Wavertree, the original hall demolished and the new school opened in November 1898. Taking in children from the age of five to sixteen, they would then be transferred to the Hardman Street School for technical training.  Early 20th century  Wavertree School for the Blind students in 1917, in a cooking lesson. Due to dwindling attendances and the Chapel having no parish of its own, it was decided to close the building in 1930, with its demolition later that year. There was great debate over the fate of the Doric front which was saved, but nothing came of the numerous suggestions. A new extension was opened in 1932 on the same site, designed by the architects Anthony Minoprio and Hugh Spencely, which provided additional work space, recreation rooms, offices and a sales shop for the goods manufactured by the students. The Hardman Street School with the new extension built on the site of the demolished chapel 1932 During the Second World War, both the Wavertree School and Hardman Street were evacuated with staff to Rhyl, moving together on 1–2 September 1939. Four buildings were taken over; the former North Wales School for Blind Children in Russell Road; Clwyd Lodge next door; Northgate House and Penrhyn Lodge, staying there for the duration, returning to Liverpool in 1946. Part of the Hardman Street school had been requisitioned by the R.A.F. until then.  Post war and the 1944 Education Act  Following the changes introduced by the new Act, Wavertree became a school for mixed pupils aged 7–11, with Henshaw's School for the Blind in Manchester taking senior children. Those with academic promise were sent to Worcester College for Boys, Chorleywood College for Girls or the Royal Normal School, where pupils would generally stay until they were eighteen. The Hardman Street School became a technical college for the North West region for those aged sixteen to twenty-one. General academic education would continue, plus the provision of vocational training in basket making, shoe repairing, brush making, and hand, flat and round machine knitting - all wholly inadequate in a modernising post war industrialised world where many blind persons were now being taken on under the terms of the Disabled Persons Employment Act of 1944. The technical college failed to move with the times, consequently numbers dwindled leading to the closure of the establishment in 1957. The building was sold to Liverpool Corporation in 1959, who leased it to the City Police who used as their headquarters until they moved to Canning Place in 1982. It was then used as the Merseyside Trade Union Community and Unemployed Resource Centre' with facilities including conference and function rooms, a small theatre, lounge, bar and a basement recording studio. It was also the used as the Flying Picket music venue. In 2015 it was refurbished and opened as the Old Blind School restaurant, but closed in June 2017. In April 2018 it reopened as The Florist restaurant The Wavertree School continued under the headship of Derek Marks from 1960, who, keen for the school to modernise, quickly introduced the Perkins Brailler. With only two machines in the country - both owned by the R.N.I.B., he placed an order for sixty with the bemused American manufacturers. Children were allowed to take them with them when they moved on to senior school. Additional buildings were added on site, together with a swimming pool in 1964 and the landscaping of the grounds, with its additional recreation areas. There was further expansion in 1966, when the Abbeyholme estate alongside the school was acquired, then in 1972 when Clifton House to the rear of the school facing Prince Alfred Road was purchased. The school was moving into a successful phase under Derek Marks and his dedicated staff, who were keen to introduce new ideas and revolutionary techniques where possible. However, more change was on the way, and as the effects of the Warnock Report took hold in the late 1970s the role of the school began to change. Under the Education Act of 1976, and later the 1981 Act, provision was made for blind and partially sighted children to be educated in the mainstream, while Wavertree began to accept children with additional challenges. By 1983 the role of the school was extended to the 'education of physically handicapped children with severe learning difficulties, and other handicaps, between the ages of three and eighteen, who would not be catered for in their local schools.' The transition took time and was finally reached by August 1989. In 1990, in tribute to over forty years of commitment and dedication in the caring and education of children with special needs, headmaster Derek Marks was awarded the O.B.E. The award was announced as he was celebrating thirty years as headmaster of Wavertree. By coincidence, in the same honours list was Ronald Wright, a pupil at the school from 1935 to 1944, who was awarded the B.E.M. for his work in the Civil Service. Also announced in 1990 was a new phase of development and a visit from the school's royal patron.  The bicentenary of the school and a visit by H.M. The Queen  In 1989, historian Mike Royden was asked by the school to look at the school archive with a view to producing a history of the school in time for the anniversary. The archive is extensive with volumes dating back to 1773, containing, for example, complete sets of Management Committee minute books and Annual Reports from 1793, Admissions Registers, medical reports, Visitors Reports, and Treasurers Reports. All were researched and indexed at this time. The subsequent history by Mike Royden, Pioneers and Perseverance - A History of the Royal School for the Blind 1791-1991 was published in 1991. A diary kept by the pupils during their evacuation to Rhyl was also discovered and included in the appendix. The Bicentennial appeal fund was launched on 13 November 1990 with a target of £2.5 Million, to provide new facilities for the challenges ahead, which included new classrooms, a hydrotherapy pool and residential facilities for parents. During the research for the school's history, Mike Royden discovered the fate of the Doric front of the Chapel demolished in 1930. Six columns in triple sections, their capitals and plynths, were found lying in the undergrowth at Camphill in Woolton, where they had lain undisturbed for sixty years. Part of the new development at the school was a water garden for the pupils, and it was decided to bring back one of the column sections, plus its capital, and have it redesigned as a centrepiece water fountain. This was unveiled by the Queen on her tour of the school in 1991. The Queen met pupils and staff and toured the school facilities, and also inspected part of the school archive. On her departure, the headmaster presented the Queen with a leather bound copy of the new history of the school.  21st century  In 2004, former pupil Steve Binns was awarded an MBE for contributions to heritage, which was received from HRH Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. In 2007, this was followed by the award of an Honorary Fellowship of Liverpool John Moores University. In 2010, the school's headmaster, Joseph Byrne, was appointed OBE. In 2011, the school was cited as one of the reasons (along with local blind charity Bradbury Fields) for UK supermarket Sainsbury's choice to use a store in nearby Woolton for its trial of Braille signage. The Redwall series of books was first written for pupils at the school when its author Brian Jacques worked there as a delivery driver. From 2016, the History of Place project carried out archival research at the school,Liverpool School for the Indigent Blind Timeline http://historyof.place/location/liverpool-school-for-the-indigent-blind/ uncovering and making public documents including diaries of some of those who attended the school,Our evacuation diary http://historyof.place/our- evacuation-diary-1939/ uncovering architectural heritage of the school, which moved several times in Liverpool.History of place - maps and the Liverpool school for the indigent blind http://historyof.place/historic-images-of-the- school-for-the-blind/ The Museum of Liverpool is holding an exhibition featuring the history of the school in 2018.Museum of Liverpool exhibition about the School for the Blind. http://historyof.place/events/exhibition-at- the-museum-of-liverpool/ Today, the Royal School for the Blind provides places for up to 66 pupils ranging in age from 2–19 years and beyond. All students have a Visual Impairment and Multiple Disabilities including difficulties ranging from moderate to profound. The children are taught in small groups with a high staff ratio. All pupils have access to the (EYFS) National Curriculum and a discrete 16-19 curriculum with an increased emphasis upon Independent Skills and Vocational Skills. Historical abuse allegations In January 2017, various media outlets reported allegations of historical physical abuse against a deceased former headmistress, Margaret McLenan, who was in post in the 1950s. In response, Susan George, president of the school, was reported to be saddened by the allegations.

He is the president of digital forensics firm Johnson-Laird Inc. in Portland, Oregon, where he lives with his wife, Kay Kitagawa. Early life Johnson-Laird was born in Sheffield in England in February, 1945. He was educated at Culford School and then attended the Regent Street Polytechnic, now known as The University of Westminster. Johnson-Laird also has lived in Ferney-Voltaire (France), Toronto (Canada), and San Jose, (Northern California). Johnson-Laird's computer career started in 1963 at National Cash Register Company's London offices where he worked as a computer operator and taught himself to program the NCR 315 mainframe computer during the night shift. He was then invited to teach as a lecturer in NCR's Computer Education department, teaching NCR customers how to program. Subsequently, he wrote system software for the NCR-Elliott 4100NCR Elliott 4100 Introduction to Software mainframe computer. Johnson-Laird also worked as a systems programmer for Control Data Corporation in Ferney-Voltaire in support of supercomputer installations at CERN. and various universities in Europe. He transferred to Control Data Corporation's Toronto Development Facility in 1977. In the late 1970s Johnson-Laird applied his knowledge of mainframe computers to the emerging hobbyist personal computer market. He purchased and hand-built a SOL-20 personal computer from Processor Technology, and a Cromemco Z-2 as test platforms. Immigration Johnson-Laird's 1979 immigration to the United States resulted in litigation over \\"a legal issue of first impression\\" concerning \\"the proper interpretation of section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s 1101(a)(15)(L), which allows 'a firm or corporation or other legal entity' to petition for the granting of 'non-immigrant' status to employees which it wishes to transfer to corporate posts in this country.\\" Johnson-Laird was successful in his challenge to the agency's interpretation of this rule to not permit a petition for an \\"L\\" visa by a sole proprietorship. Johnson-Laird was represented by Portland immigration attorney, Gerald H. Robinson Esq.. United States District Court Judge James Redden ruled that \\"Congress intended that the legal status of the petitioning business not be a dispositive consideration in immigration proceedings.\\".Johnson-Laird, Inc. v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 537 F.Supp. 52 (D.C.Or., 1981) On arriving in the U.S.A. in 1979, Johnson- Laird wrote the software drivers to permit the CP/M Operating System to run on an Onyx computer—this was the first commercial CP/M microcomputer with a hard disk and a data cartridge tape drive.\\"New Onyx CP/M 2.0 Operating System\\", InfoWorld (then Intelligent Machines Journal), 21 Nov 1979, p.4 Johnson-Laird is one of the early pioneers in the field of digital forensics. His specialty, developed in 1987, is forensic software analysis of computer and Internet- based evidence for copyright, patent, and trade-secret litigation. He is also an expert on software reverse engineering, software development, and developing software in a clean-room environment. Johnson-Laird developed techniques for computerized source code analysis and the presentation of computer-based evidence that have helped to bring digital forensics into the courtroom. He has served as a Special Master to Federal District Court judges, and has served as an expert witness and provided litigation testimony in many intellectual property cases in the United States and Singapore. He also has published numerous articles on topics related to digital forensics and the legal challenges posed by emerging technologies. Computer software expert witness In addition to serving as a technical expert in high-profile and significant litigation, Johnson-Laird's published writings have been cited by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, first in Sega Enterprises Ltd., v. Accolade Inc., No. 92-15665, D.C. No. CV-91-3871-BAC, as authority for practical necessity to make intermediary copies to understand protected expression in software.The court cited the original presentation of the article \\"Technical Demonstration of Decompilation,\\" later published in Computer Law Reporter, Volume 16, Number 3, November 1992 and reprinted in Reverse Engineering: Legal and Business Strategies for Competitive Design in the 1990s 102 (Prentice Hall Law & Business ed. 1992) Later the court cited Johnson-Laird's article \\"Software Reverse Engineering in the Real World,\\" University of Dayton Law Review, Volume 19, November 3, Spring 1994, in the case Sony v. Connectix, No. 99-15852, D.C.

Sound Images, Inc., Civil No. 3:2006–76, *4 n.5 (W.D.Pa.,March 31, 2010) and by the Western District of Virginia in Frontline Test Equipment, Inc. v. Greenleaf Software, Inc., 10 F.Supp.2d 583, 586 n.5 (W.D.Va.,1998). In 1994, the Honorable Marvin J. Garbis, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland appointed Johnson-Laird as a court-appointed expert in the matter of Vaughn v. Amprey,Vaughn v. Amprey Civil Action No. MJG-84-1911. Additionally, in 2007 Johnson-Laird was appointed as Special Master by Judge Stephen V. Wilson, Central District of California, in the MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. case. His appointment on remand encompassed recommending appropriate actions to impose by Permanent Injunction on Defendant StreamCast that would \\"cope with the copyright infringement\\" caused by peer-to-peer file sharing systems, while \\"preserving non-infringing uses\\" of the system. In 2010 he was appointed Special Master in DataSci v. Medidata, a case before the Honorable Marvin J. Garbis, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. His role was to resolve discovery disputes relating to the production of computer source code. =Role in the CP/M v. DOS dispute= Because of Johnson-Laird's experience with writing the software drivers for the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) for various microcomputers, John Katsaros of Digital Research engaged him to create BIOS drivers for CP/M-86 for the first IBM personal computer. Working in conditions of considerable IBM-imposed secrecy in Digital Research's Pacific Grove offices, Johnson-Laird discovered a Microsoft employee's name, Bob O'Rear, in the boot sector of the PC DOS diskette. He reported this and the numerous similarities in the application programming interface of PC DOS and CP/M to Gary Kildall. Kildall was stunned to see the similarities.Evans, Harold; Gail Buckland; David Lefer (2004). They Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine: Two Centuries of Innovators. Little, Brown and Co. , page 412. \\"There were some shallow changes, but it was essentially the same program,\\" Johnson-Laird reported in an interview with BusinessWeek.Hamm, Steve; Jay Greene (October 25, 2004). \\"The Man Who Could Have Been Bill Gates\\". BusinessWeek. It later turned out that Microsoft had licensed a program called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products. Tim Paterson had created 86-DOS, which he originally called QDOS, by copying the functional application programming interface from the CP/M manuals. 86-DOS became Microsoft's MS-DOS and IBM's PC DOS. Photography and documentaries Johnson-Laird is a photographer and a documentary film maker. In 2005 he implemented a variant of a technique known as streak photography, that used computer software to create computer-generated images. His techniques of computational photography create photographs that are compositions of color and line that appear realistic, but are not. In 2010, in collaboration with Kay Kitagawa and Dina Gomez, Johnson-Laird directed, produced, and edited \\"EMMA: Unplugged,\\" a 90-minute documentary of the 2010 Emma International Collaboration, an artists' retreat in the Saskatchewan boreal forest hosted by the Saskatchewan Craft Council. He has also directed, produced, and edited other video projects. Works authored Published writings by Johnson-Laird include: * \\"Looking Forward, Legislating Backward?\\", 4 J. Small & Emerging Bus.

When she left, she crossed the Second Bar on 21 June, and her voyage ended on 13 February 1797. =Voyage #7 (1798-1800)= James Tennant was Earl Cornwalliss captain for her seventh and last voyage for the EIC. He received a letter of marque on 26 July 1798. He left Portsmouth on 4 October 1798, bound for Madras and Bengal. Earl Cornwallis reached the Cape on 20 January 1799 Cape and Madras on 12 April. She then visited Celyon on 11 May, before returning to Madras on 18 May. She arrived at Diamond Harbour on 30 May. She passed Saugor on 25 August, reached St Helena on 27 January 1800, and arrived at the Downs on 30 May. On this voyage she carried the 51st Regiment of Foot to Ceylon. Convict transport In 1800 her owners sold Earl Cornwallis to Wilson & Co., who hired her out to carry convicts to Australia. Under the command of James Tennent, Earl Cornwallis sailed from Portsmouth on 18 November 1800, and arrived at Port Jackson on 12 June 1801.Bateson (1974), pp.288-9. She transported 193 male and 95 female convicts, of whom 27 male and eight female convicts died.Bateson (1974), p.326. All had died of dysentery, and many of the survivors were weak and feeble. One officer and 20 men of the New South Wales Corps provided guards. Earl Cornwallis left Port Jackson on 4 October bound for India. She carried on board 150 tons of coal from Newcastle, New South Wales. This is believed to have been the first export of coal from Newcastle. In June 1802, i.e., after the Treaty of Amiens she sailed to Île de France having on board a number of French prisoners, who had been detained in Bengal. The prisoners were under the charge of Mr. Campbell, who the Bengal Government had also charged with negotiating with the Governor of Île de France for the release of three vessels, Tay, Highland Chief, and Porcher, that the French privateer Bellone had captured just prior to the signing of the \\"Preliminaries of Peace\\". The vessels and their cargoes were estimated to be worth £100,000.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.513. Campbell was unsuccessful, at least with respect to Porcher. Subsequent career It is not clear what Earl Cornwallis did subsequent to her mission to Île de France. Lloyd's Register carries Earl Cornwallis from 1800 to 1808 with the unchanged information of J. Tennent, master, Wilson & Co., owner, and trade: London to Botany Bay.

Early life Hatton was born in Preston, Somerset, England on 8 September 1835 to Elizabeth Stenner and Robert Hanover. As a young woman, she was involved with Sunday-school work, and she campaigned for temperance with the Band of Hope. She worked as a milliner. On 7 October 1855 she married Joseph Hatton, an accountant. They went to Amsterdam and founded a lodge for the temperance organisation Good Templars. At some point, the Hattons emigrated to New Zealand and settled in Dunedin. Suffrage movement On 12 April 1892, Hatton chaired a meeting in Dunedin in support of women's suffrage. She became one of two presidents and the working leader of the Dunedin Franchise League, which was founded two weeks later. The Franchise League campaigned against the anti-suffrage politician Henry Fish's bid for the mayoralty of Dunedin later in 1892. \\"Rejoice with us\\", Hatton wrote, \\"we have beaten Mr Fish\\". Hatton became the principal speaker for the Franchise League, and travelled throughout the southern half of the South Island with Helen Nicol speaking at suffrage meetings and organising petitions requesting the government to enact women's suffrage. The Dunedin Franchise League collected more signatures than any other area. A bill to do so was passed by the Legislative Council on 8 September 1893 – Hatton's birthday. A celebratory meeting was held in the Dunedin City Hall with a \\"thousand handkerchiefs waving for victory\\". Hatton next worked to make sure as many women as possible were on the electoral rolls for the general election on 28 November 1893.Grimshaw, pp 95–97 During the winter of 1895, Hatton and other members of the League ran soup kitchens for the unemployed. Hatton continued to work for equality of women with men. She was particularly concerned that women should receive equal pay. In 1896, Hatton suggested that a co-ordinating body be set up for women's societies in New Zealand, and this led to the formation of the National Council of Women. She attended its inaugural conference in Christchurch, on 13 April 1896.Grimshaw, p 112 Later life Hatton suffered from heart disease and her health deteriorated. Her philanthropic work may have contributed to this. She died on 6 June 1905, survived by her husband, five sons, and a daughter.

Ib Spang Olsen (11 June 1921 – 15 January 2012) was a Danish writer and illustrator best known to generations of Danes for cartoons and illustrations, many of which appeared in children's publications. Those include a series of nursery rhyme books written by Halfdan Rasmussen, including \\"Halfdans ABC\\". He also wrote his own children's books, such as the whimsical tale of the seasons, The Marsh Crone's Brew. Olsen drew for newspapers, magazines, books, posters, television, and comics. For his lasting contribution as a children's illustrator Olsen received the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1972. Life Olsen was born in Østerbro, Copenhagen. He had a modest upbringing but his memories of his childhood remained and became inspirations for his humorous and grotesque pencil drawings of everyday life. Olsen died in Copenhagen following a short illness on 15 January 2012, at the age of 90. His memorial service was held at the Marienborg Chapel on 23 January. He was survived by his wife, the artist Nulle Øigaard, and by his four children: Tine and Tune from his first marriage, filmmaker Lasse Spang Olsen and Martin Spang Olsen from his marriage to Øigaard. Lasse began a documentary film about his father in 2005 entitled Det er med hjertet man ser.  Career  He first worked as a cartoonist in 1942 for the Hjemmets Søndag section of the Social-Demokraten, a trade union newspaper (now the Aktuelt). He then enrolled in the Copenhagen Art Academy and the Graphic School, where he studied from 1945 to 1949. From 1952 to 1961 he taught at Bernadotteskolen. Throughout his career, he illustrated for newspapers, magazines, books, comics, and even television and posters. Olsen is known for his experimental forms and one of the artistic highlights is Det lille lokomotiv (The Little Train), which was published in 1954. While his drawings usually included pencil, Olsen used different drawing techniques such as zincography and heliographics, which made it possible to print original drawings in book prints and offset. In 1982, Olsen also became the chairman of the Danish Ministry of Culture’s working group about children and culture. He was also a member of the Academia Council, which is part of the Royal Danish Art Academy.

He later served as the Administrator of Western Samoa and worked for the Imperial War Graves Commission. Hart volunteered for the Ninth New Zealand South African Contingent, which was raised for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. By the time the contingent arrived in South Africa, the war was largely over. He saw extensive action during the First World War as a volunteer with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, first at Gallipoli and then on the Western Front. By the end of the war, he had advanced in rank to brigadier general, commanding a number of brigades in the New Zealand Division. Trained as a lawyer before the war, Hart returned to New Zealand to resume his legal practice after his discharge from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He later served as Administrator of Western Samoa from 1931 to 1935 and was knighted for his services in this role. From 1936 to 1943, he worked in the Middle East for the Imperial War Graves Commission, a task made difficult by the outbreak of the Second World War and the subsequent fighting in the region. Following his retirement in late 1943, he became involved in Rotary International. He died at his home in Masterton on 5 March 1968. Early life Hart was born at Taratahi, a small community near Carterton in the Wairarapa region. His father, William, was a farm labourer and the grandson of John Hart, a three- time Premier of South Australia. One of four children, he was educated firstly at Dalefield School, and then Carterton School. After finishing his formal education he worked for his uncle, an auctioneer and land broker, while also studying bookkeeping. In 1900, Hart's brother Walter travelled to South Africa for service with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart to volunteer for the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, along with another brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By the time he reached South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand with the rest of the contingent. Hart eventually returned to New Zealand in early 1903. Shortly after his return he married Minnie Renall, the daughter of a farmer. The couple would have four children, one of whom died in infancy. He resumed working at his uncle's business and eventually became a director of the company. However, rather than pursue bookkeeping as a career, he commenced legal studies. He qualified as a solicitor in 1907, becoming a partner in a Carterton practice which he had joined the previous year. Hart was also active in the Volunteer Force. It was common practice in the Volunteer Force for the men of a unit to elect their officers although they were sometimes directed by their superiors to vote for certain candidates. Hart was duly elected a lieutenant in the Carterton Rifle Volunteers. When the Volunteer Force was abolished in 1910 and replaced with the Territorial Force, which was organised more like a conventional military, he chose to continue his service. He was well regarded by his superiors and was promoted to captain in 1911. When he was promoted to major the following year, he was the youngest officer with that rank in his battalion. He was serving with the 1st Battalion of the 17th (Ruahine) Regiment when the First World War broke out. First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Hart immediately volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), which was being raised for service in the war on Britain's behalf. He was appointed second in command of the Wellington Infantry Battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel William Malone. The battalion embarked from Wellington in October 1914 for Egypt, and upon arrival, was primarily engaged in training before it was deployed along the Suez Canal late in January 1915 to support Indian troops stationed to guard against a rumoured Turkish attack. Three weeks of sentry duty ensued for the battalion before returning to Cairo. =Gallipoli= At this stage of the war, the Allied forces were preparing for the Gallipoli Campaign, which was part of a plan conceived by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to seize control of the Dardanelles. This would leave the Turkish capital, Constantinople, vulnerable to attack. The New Zealand and Australian Division, under the command of Major General Alexander Godley (also commander of the NZEF), was being formed for the campaign, and Hart's battalion was attached to the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, one of the two infantry brigades (the other was the Australian 4th Brigade) that formed the bulk of the division. In April, the division embarked for Gallipoli and the Wellington Battalion was landed at Anzac Cove on the afternoon of 25 April, and made its way up to Plugge's Plateau. The battalion was involved in defending against Turkish attacks on Walker's Ridge on 27 April. Hart was wounded in the thigh while supervising the establishment of defensive positions. His wounds necessitated his evacuation to Alexandria the following day. He was later awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his leadership of the battalion during this action. Hart was promoted to lieutenant colonel while recovering from his wounds in England. He returned to the Dardanelles in September 1915 as commander of the Wellington Battalion, Malone having been killed in action in early August during the Battle of Chunuk Bair. The battalion had been decimated during the battle but remained in the line manning positions at 'The Apex', a knoll near Chunuk Bair. Along with the rest of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, the battalion was transferred to the Greek island of Lemnos on 14 September for a period of rest and recuperation while it was also being built up with reinforcements from New Zealand. While on Lemnos, Hart commanded the brigade for a 12-day period when its nominal commander, Brigadier General Francis Earl Johnston, was hospitalised. Hart led the battalion back to Gallipoli in early November, where it returned to its former positions at \\"The Apex\\". With no major offensive operations conducted since its return, he and his battalion eventually evacuated the peninsula in December, with Hart amongst the last of his unit to leave on 19 December. =Western Front= Brigadier General Hart inspecting men of the 4th Brigade, 6 July 1917 Returning to Egypt, Hart was heavily involved with the training of his command, which included a substantial number of replacements. He was also required to divest a number of his more experienced officers and non- commissioned officers to help with the formation of the 2nd Battalion of the Wellington Regiment. His battalion was subsequently re-designated as the 1st Battalion, Wellington Regiment, while the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was reformed as the 1st Infantry Brigade. The brigade was one of the three infantry brigades to make up the newly formed New Zealand Division, intended for service on the Western Front and it was duly shipped to France in April 1916. The division was initially based near Armentières and Hart's battalion was among those manning the trenches in the sector. The battalion had to contend with artillery and repelling localised attacks and raids by the opposing Germans. Hart organised a counter-raid to be conducted by his battalion, and this was successfully executed on 1 July. The division would remain in the Armentières sector until August 1916, at which stage it was withdrawn for use in the forthcoming Somme Offensive in September. Hart led his battalion during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette and the subsequent period in the trenches, and was mentioned in despatches for his work during this time. He also had spells as temporary commander of the brigade while Johnston was on leave, and from December 1916 to January 1917 was in command of 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. In March 1917, Hart was promoted to brigadier general and appointed commander of the newly formed 4th Infantry Brigade. The new brigade was intended for service with the New Zealand Division. After a brief training period in England, the brigade was transferred to France for further training and a period in the front line. In October, it saw service during the successful attack on the Abraham Heights on the Gravenstafel Spur in what was known as the Battle of Broodseinde and was commended for its services by both Godley, still commanding the NZEF, and the commander of the New Zealand Division, Major General Andrew Russell. The brigade was in reserve for the subsequent First Battle of Passchendaele, and, apart from a brief period in training, would remain in the Ypres sector until January. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while it was on the front line. Hart was made commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while it was on the front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. The barrage, using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering his sight, which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce. Hart (right front) with His Royal Highness Edward, Prince of Wales (centre front) and officers of the 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade, Cologne, January 1919 Upon recovery from the effects of his gassing, and aided by the temporary presence of his wife Minnie, Hart returned to England and was placed in command of the New Zealand reserves at Sling Camp in Bulford. Here he was responsible for the training of reinforcements and casualties who were regaining fitness. On 3 June, his leadership of the 4th Brigade was honoured with an appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, although he took little personal satisfaction in the recognition. Hart's duties at Sling Camp ended in July, when he was recalled to France to take over command of the 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. He led the brigade through the Hundred Days Offensive, which included an action during the Second Battle of Bapaume that impressed his commanding officer, Russell. During the battle, Hart's headquarters was again shelled with mustard gas. After his previous experience of being gassed, Hart found the shelling 'annoying'. The brigade also participated in the capture of Le Quesnoy in November 1918. This was a difficult assignment for the presence of civilians in the walled town meant that artillery could not support the attack. Instead a small party was able to scale the walls and put flight to the Germans defending that section. This allowed the remainder of the attacking force to enter the town, which quickly surrendered. A few days later, the mayor of Le Quesnoy presented Hart with the French flag that was raised over the town on the day it was captured from the Germans. After the armistice that ended the war, Hart led the brigade into Germany for occupation duties with the remainder of the New Zealand Division. His headquarters was near Cologne and in January 1919, played host to the Prince of Wales. The division itself was in the process of demobilising, with around 1,000 men returning to New Zealand via England every week, and the Rifle Brigade was disbanded in early February. Hart was twice mentioned in despatches during his period in command of the Rifle Brigade. In mid-February he received his orders to return to New Zealand and he duly left England on 12 March 1919. Hart arrived in his home town of Carterton to a hero's welcome on 25 April 1919, five years to the day after being landed at Gallipoli. The guest of honour at several receptions held around the Wairarapa over the next several days, he made a point of acknowledging the role played by the ordinary soldier in the eventual victory over the Germans while downplaying his own contributions. He was eventually discharged from the NZEF in late May 1919. His services in the war were subsequently recognised with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The French government also awarded him with the Croix de guerre. Post-war career Upon discharge from the NZEF, Hart resumed legal work in his Carterton practice. However, within a few months, he moved his family to Masterton and established a new law firm. He became involved with the charity organisation Rotary International and set up the Masterton chapter of Rotary in 1925. He maintained an association with the military; after an initial spell in the reserve of officers, he resumed his involvement with the Territorial Force and served as commander of the 2nd (Wellington) Infantry Brigade for several years. He was eventually returned to the reserve of officers in 1925. To acknowledge his long military career, he was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration (VD) and appointed honorary colonel of his old Territorial Force unit, the Hawkes' Bay Regiment (formerly 17th (Ruahine) Regiment). He retired from the military in 1930. Hart was a longtime advocate for the welfare of former soldiers and was active in the Returned Services Association (RSA). The organisation later awarded Hart the Gold Badge, its highest honour, for his advocacy on the behalf of former servicemen. =Western Samoa= Hart (left centre, saluting) receiving the salute upon arrival in Apia, Western Samoa in April 1931 In 1930, Hart applied for and was appointed to the position of Administrator of Western Samoa, which was controlled by New Zealand under a mandate from the League of Nations. This was a difficult period for the colony as many of its citizens wanted independence. The Mau movement in particular was agitating for self- determination and employed tactics of civil disobedience as a means of opposing the New Zealand administration. After some heavy-handed management of protestors by his predecessor had resulted in several deaths amongst the movement, Hart made progress in improving relationships with the Mau when he took up his position in 1931. He also returned some financial stability to the colony which had struggled during the Great Depression. Hart was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services in Samoa shortly before completing his term as administrator and returning to New Zealand in July 1935. =Imperial War Graves Commission= In 1936, Hart accepted a position in the Middle East with the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). This position was usually the preserve of an Australian or New Zealander due to the number of dead from these two countries buried in the area. Although his new position of Deputy Controller of the Eastern District was nominally based in Jerusalem, he and his wife initially moved to Cairo because of the Arab revolt against the British Mandate in Palestine. It was not until March 1937, after the conditions in Palestine had sufficiently improved, that the couple moved to Jerusalem. They were later joined by their daughter, Bettina, who was married to a British Army officer also based in Jerusalem. Hart's new role involved overseeing the upkeep of the cemeteries and memorials established by the Commission in the Middle East, Turkey and Greece. Ensuring the maintenance of these places required extensive travel, and his duties also became more difficult when Italy joined in the Second World War in June 1940 and conflict broke out in the Middle East. This required the creation of an organisation responsible for the graves of Allied personnel killed in the region. Consequently, Hart became Assistant Director, Graves Registration and Inquiry Section for the Middle East, in addition to his existing Commission duties. His new position entailed him becoming a serving officer in the British Army as a lieutenant, but with the acting rank of brigadier. He set up grave registration units, new cemeteries and organised the relocation of existing graves in remote areas to the new cemeteries. This work struck a personal note when his nephew was killed during the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. Early the following year Hart visited the El Alamein battlefield and the nearby cemetery, the establishment of which was partly due to the infrastructure he helped put in place, to lay flowers at his nephew's grave. Although he found the work satisfying, Hart retired from the Commission in September 1943. His wife, daughter, and Merrilyn, his granddaughter who had been born in Jerusalem, had left for New Zealand earlier that month. He followed a few weeks later once his successor at the Commission arrived. His work with the Graves Registration section had finished a year earlier. Later life Settling back in the Wairarapa, Hart resumed his involvement with Rotary. He served a spell as president of the North Island district of Rotary, and attended overseas conventions. During the 1960s, there was a growing argument that the First World War was an unnecessary conflict. In speeches that he made during his community and RSA duties, he continued to advocate the importance of the war in countering Imperial German aggression. He attended reunions of his former units, including the Wellington Infantry Regiment and the Rifle Brigade. He had assisted the authors of the histories of both formations in the years after the First World War. In 1955, in honour of the 40th anniversary of the formation of the Rifle Brigade, Hart presented the flag which he had been given by the mayor of Le Quesnoy following its capture from the Germans in 1918 to Wellington Cathedral. With age, Hart's involvement in community affairs decreased but he remained physically active, regularly playing golf and bowls. He died at his home in Masterton on 5 March 1968, his wife having predeceased him by nearly 18 months, and was buried with full military honours. The last surviving senior officer of the NZEF at the time of his death, he was well regarded by both the men he had commanded during the war and his superior officers.

Emily Cumming Harris (28 March 1836 - 5 August 1925) was one of New Zealand's first professional women painters. She chiefly painted New Zealand plants and flowers and worked mainly in water colour. She was born in Plymouth, Devon, England in about 1837 but spent most of her life in Nelson, New Zealand. Early life Harris was the daughter of Sarah Hill and her husband Edwin Harris. The Harris family emigrated from England on the \\"William Bryan\\", a ship of the Plymouth Company of New Zealand. They reached New Zealand on 31 March 1841. Harris' father was a surveyor as well as a competent artist who supported his daughters efforts in painting. Her mother was a teacher who established a primary school in Taranaki. Harris subsequently became an assistant teacher at that school. Following the outbreak of the First Taranaki War in March 1860, Harris was sent to Hobart to study while her family moved to Nelson. After spending several years in Australia she returned to Nelson where she joined her sisters in running a small primary school and giving private lessons in music, dancing and drawing. She continued to paint but sales of her work were never sufficient to allow her to give up teaching to concentrate on her art full- time. Exhibitions Harris showed her work at exhibitions in New Zealand and overseas. In 1879 she exhibited at the Sydney International Exhibit where she was awarded a first degree of merit. She also exhibited at the 1880 - 1881 Melbourne International Exhibition. In 1885 she sent work to the Auckland Art Student's Exhibition as well as to the New Zealand Industrial Exhibit where she won first prize and a silver medal for a painted screen. She was also awarded third prize for a painted table top. In 1886 she was commended for work at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London and in 1888 -1889 again exhibited in Melbourne at the Centennial International Exhibition. She also organised exhibits of her own work in Nelson, Wellington, New Plymouth and Stratford in 1889 and 1890, and again in New Plymouth in 1899. In 1896 she exhibited at her studio in Nelson. Published work Harris published three books, New Zealand Flowers , New Zealand Ferns and New Zealand Berries. These were later published in a single volume, Flowers, ferns and berries of New Zealand. Harris also illustrated a children's book by Sarah Moore called Fairyland in New Zealand published in 1909. Unpublished work She completed a book entitled New Zealand Mountain Flowers in the 1890s which was never published. The Alexander Turnbull Library purchased the manuscript in London in 1970. Later life Emily Cumming Harris' grave, Wakapuaka Cemetery Harris's professional artistic development and success was constrained by family obligations, straitened finances and the conventions of her time. However, in 1924 the Alexander Turnbull Library purchased 63 of her water colours. She continued to live and paint in the family home at Nile Street, Nelson, until her death aged 88, on 5 August 1925. She is buried at Wakapuaka cemetery in Nelson.

Born in 1895, Hanson joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the First World War and served on the Western Front. By the end of the war he had reached the rank of sergeant and been awarded the Military Medal. During the interwar period, he was employed by the Public Works Department on hydroelectric projects and public roading. He later worked for the Main Highways Board. During the Second World War, he served with the 2nd New Zealand Division as a commander of an engineering field company. He later became the overall commander of the New Zealand Engineers of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force and served in Greece, Crete, North Africa and Italy. He received official recognition for his efforts in the war, receiving the Distinguished Service Order and bar and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Ending the war with the rank of brigadier, he returned to civilian life as the chief engineer of the Main Highways Board. He was later appointed the Commissioner of Works, the senior position at the Ministry of Works and responsible for 4,500 employees. Retiring from public service in 1961, he died in 1979 at the age of 84. Early life Born in the town of Levin, in the Horowhenua District of New Zealand, on 9 July 1895, Frederick Melrose Horowhenua Hanson was the son of a farmer, also called Frederick Hanson, and his wife, Eliza Elizabeth Tantrum. He was educated locally and won a scholarship to Wellington College where he excelled both in his studies and sports. He participated in the school's cadet program and in 1914 was commissioned in the Territorial Force as a second lieutenant. In 1915, Hanson passed the entrance examination for the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Australia, which set aside a limited number of enrolments for New Zealanders. He duly entered Duntroon but misled authorities as to his age. Although academically successful, misconduct resulted in his expulsion from Duntroon in October 1917. First World War Returning to New Zealand, Hanson volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service in the First World War. He was posted to the Wellington Infantry Regiment, then serving on the Western Front. He soon attained the rank of sergeant and, for his gallantry in an action that took place in September 1918, was awarded the Military Medal. After the war, he was part of a team of NZEF personnel that toured the United Kingdom playing rugby. He eventually returned to New Zealand in September 1919. Interwar period Hanson returned to civilian life, becoming a qualified surveyor. He remained in the Territorial Force and was promoted to lieutenant soon after arriving back in New Zealand. He was moved to the reserve of officers in 1922 and eventually was placed on the retired list in 1930. In the meantime, he had joined the Public Works Department. He worked on hydroelectric projects for a time and then moved into roading. In 1935, he developed the low cost road surfacing technique known as chipseal that remains in widespread use. He was later an engineer for the Main Highways Board. Second World War Hanson enlisted in what became the second echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) following the outbreak of the Second World War. In January 1940, with the rank of major, he was posted to command of 7th Field Company, New Zealand Engineers, for which officers and non-commissioned officers began a period of training at Narrow Neck Camp, in Auckland, before the main body of the company arrived at the nearby Papakura Military Camp. With training complete by late April 1940, 7th Field Company left New Zealand aboard the RMS Aquitania, destined, along the other units aboard, for Egypt. It was to join the first echelon of 2NZEF to form what would be known as the 2nd New Zealand Division. However, the second echelon was diverted en route to England following the threat of a German invasion. Here Hanson's company carried out training and guard duties in the area around Dover before being shipped to Egypt in early 1941. Within a matter of weeks, the 2nd New Zealand Division was in Greece and manning defences on the Aliakmon Line in preparation for the anticipated invasion of the country by the Germans. During the subsequent retreat of the Allies following the commencement of the German advance into Greece, Hanson's command was often involved in delaying tactics through the destruction of strategic points. After the end of the campaign in Greece, most of the division's personnel, including Hanson, were evacuated to the island of Crete. Here, Hanson was appointed the acting Commander, Royal Engineers (CRE), for the division. He and his men were kept busy building defensive positions for use in the subsequent Battle of Crete. He had proposed to render the airfield at Maleme unusable but was overruled. The airfield subsequently fell to German forces once their invasion of Crete began on 20 May and it proved crucial in allowing reinforcements and supplies to be landed in the early stages of the battle. At one stage, Hanson was involved in an attack, the Battle of 42nd Street, but eventually the New Zealanders and other surviving Allied forces had to be evacuated from the island to Egypt. Back in North Africa, Hanson was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made the permanent CRE for the 2nd New Zealand Division. He was active in the African campaigns of 1941-42 and was recognised for his efforts in September 1942 with an appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. The following year, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for an action at Wadi Akarit in April 1943. Later that year he was made CRE for the entire 2NZEF. By this stage of the war, the 2nd New Zealand Division was participating in the Italian Campaign. Hanson was largely responsible for the development of the river crossing techniques employed by the New Zealanders as they gradually advanced up Italy. He received a bar to his DSO for this work. After the war, he was discharged from the 2NZEF with the rank of brigadier. Later life In 1946, Hanson returned to the Main Highways Board, this time as its chief engineer. He worked towards the implementation of legalisation that re-organised the Main Highways Board into the National Roads Board, and was appointed its first chairman. In 1955, he was appointed to the senior position at the Ministry of Works (formerly the Public Works Department), the Commissioner of Works, having spent the previous four years as Deputy Commissioner. His ministry, which employed almost 4,500 people, played an important role in the economic resurrection of New Zealand following the Second World War, with several major developments relating to hydroelectric schemes. He also served a term on the Army Board, from 1952 to 1955 and was president of the New Zealand Institution of Engineers for two years. Hanson retired from the Ministry of Works in December 1961 but not before being recognised for his public services with an appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1961 Queen's Birthday Honours. He died on 15 July 1979. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Constance Grindley, who he had married in 1924. The couple had no children.

Gitaldaha was a railway station and is a defunct rail transit point on the India-Bangladesh border in Cooch Behar district in the Indian state of West Bengal. The corresponding point on the Bangladesh side is Mogalhat in Lalmonirhat District. Railway links The area was agog with railway activity in the 19th-20th century.The Assam Behar State Railway linked Parbatipur to Katihar, with a metre gauge line in 1889. In the early 1900s, the Eastern Bengal Railway extended railways to Lalmonirhat, Gitaldaha (via Mogalhat), Bamanhat, Golokganj and other places, thereby connecting Assam to Katihar, in Bihar, via North Bengal. In 1901 Cooch Behar State Railway built the narrow gauge line from Gitaldaha to Jayanti, near the Bhutan border. Shortly thereafter, the line was upgraded to meter gauge. The Lalmonirhat- Mogalhat-Gitaldaha route was functional when India and Pakistan agreed in 1955 for resumption of railway traffic between the two countries, and it included movement of cross traffic via Mogalhat through the Eastern Bengal Railway.A portion of the bridge across the Dharla River at was washed away by floods in 1988. Prior to the partition of India, the prestigious Assam Mail used to travel from Santahar to Guwahati. The conversion of the 72 km long Alipurduar- Bamanhat branch line to Broad gauge in 2007, and its subsequent recommissioning, had a station at New Gitaldaha. New Gitaldaha railway station serves Gitaldaha and the surrounding areas. The map alongside presents the position as it stands today (2020).

Early life and education Born in Ordrup to the north of Copenhagen, Aagaard Andersen attended the Arts and Crafts School (Kunsthåndværkersole) from 1936 to 1939. Between 1940 and 1946, he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Aksel Jørgensen and Gunnar Biilmann Petersen. He also spent a short period studying etching at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. From 1946 to 1950, he studied in Paris under the sculptor Ossip Zadkine, after which he travelled to Italy (1951) and England (1952–53). Career Munkeruphus, Aagaard Andersen's home from 1958 until his death Aagaard Andersen first exhibited at the Kunstnernes Efterårsudstilling (Artists Autumn Exhibition) in 1937. Initially he created mainly drawings and sketches but he also painted. In the 1940s, he illustrated a number of books in a Realist style but while he was in Paris, he was inspired to paint Concrete art works. He was one of the founders of the Linien II artists association (1948–52), ensuring a working relationship between new trends in French art and developments in Denmark. In France, he joined the newly formed concrete art association Groupe Espace which brought together architects, sculptors, engineers and painters who collaborated on creating works in the open air. Aagaard Andersen was one of 45 participants in the large outdoor exhibition they presented in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes in 1954. In the 1950s, he created architectural designs integrated with decorative works for the textile firm Mads Eg Damgaard in Herning, giving him an opportunity to demonstrate his understanding of integrated art. During the same period, he produced carpets and textiles in collaboration with Unika Vaev. He was also active as a designer, producing a polyester chair in 1964 which is now exhibited in New York's Museum of Modern Art, MoMA. His most comprehensive achievement in decoration was for the Odense Concert Hall in 1983. From 1972 to 1982, Aagaard Andersen was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. He died in Munkerup on 29 June 1982. Aagaar Andersen has exhibited widely both in Denmark and abroad. There was a large exhibition of his work in 2013 at Den Frie Udstilling in Copenhagen. Awards In 1977, Aagaard Andersen was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1980, the Thorvaldsen Medal.

It originally was a relatively small lighthouse that was only active during the season of the herring fisheries. In 1867, the original light was replaced by larger wooden lighthouse. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany the occupants constructed fortifications at the site. That lighthouse was automated in 1977. In 1983, the old, wooden lighthouse was closed down and replaced by a smaller, automated lighthouse on the same site. Design The tall light sits at an elevation of above sea level.

On December 11, 1961, the court unanimously ruled that Louisiana could not convict peaceful sit-in protesters who refused to leave dining establishments under the state's \\"disturbing the peace\\" laws.. Background African-American students from Southern University sat at a \\"whites only\\" segregated lunch bar at Sitman's Drugstore in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The management summoned the Police after the students quietly remained despite being asked to relocate to another counter. After ordering the black patrons to leave, the Police arrested them and charged them with disturbing the peace, claiming that their behavior could \\"foreseeably disturb or alarm the public,\\" according to the state's \\"disturbing the peace\\" statute. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People defended the student demonstrators as did the Kennedy administration's Justice Department, which filed a legal brief on their behalf.Geer, J. G., W. J. Schiller, et al. (2011). Gateways to Democracy: An Introduction to American Government, Wadsworth Pub Co. Opinion of the Court In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled in the African-American students' favor, arguing the state violated due process of law under the 14th amendment and finding there was no evidence the students' behavior could have foreseeably disturbed the peace. In his written opinion, Justice John Marshall Harlan likened sit-in demonstrations to verbal expression as a form of free speech. Justice William O. Douglas in his concurring opinion said, “For the police are supposed to be on the side of the Constitution, not on the side of discrimination. Yet if all constitutional questions are to be put aside and the problem treated merely in terms of disturbing the peace, I would have difficulty in reversing these judgments.

The book focuses on the author's travels across the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Peninsula between 1945 and 1950. It attempted to capture the lives of the Bedu people and other inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula. It is considered a classic of travel literature. The book largely reflects on the changes and large scale development that took place after the Second World War and the subsequent gradual erosion of traditional Bedouin ways of life that had previously existed unaltered for thousands of years. Context Wilfred Thesiger was born into a privileged English background, the son of a diplomat, educated at Eton and Oxford. As soon as he could, on his first summer holiday at university, he travelled to Istanbul, going out by tramp steamer, back by train: the first of many adventurous journeys. At age 23 he went on his first exploration, of the Awash River in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). He became a colonial officer in Sudan, working in the desert region of Darfur and then the swampy Sudd, where he was responsible for shooting lions. While in Darfur he journeyed with local people by camel and visited the Tibesti mountains in the Sahara. In the Second World War he fought to liberate Abyssinia under the eccentric but charismatic Orde Wingate, and in the Special Air Service behind enemy lines in the Western Desert of north Africa. After the war he joined the anti-locust unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization, taking the chance between 1945 and 1949 to travel in the Empty Quarter of Arabia. Arabian Sands describes his two crossings of that region. Thesiger begins his Introduction by saying that if he had thought of writing a book about his journeys, he \\"should have kept fuller notes which now would have both helped and hindered me\\".Thesiger, 1959. Introduction. He did however keep some kind of diary of his travels, later polishing his notes in letters to his mother, and then (years later) writing up his books from those. His two Arabian journeys described here took place between 1946 and 1948; the book appeared in 1959. Editions Arabian Sands first appeared in 1959 in London (Longmans) and New York (Dutton). It was reprinted in 1960, 1963, 1964 (concise and Penguin editions), 1965, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1990 (Collins), 1991 (with second preface), 2000, 2005 (Folio Society), 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010. It has been translated into languages including Swedish (Arabisk öken 1960) Spanish (Arenas de arabia 1963, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2008), Italian (Sabbie arabe 1984, 2002), German (Die Brunnen der Wüste 2002), French (Le Désert des Déserts 1978) and Arabic (1994). Book ;List of Maps ;Preface ;Introduction ;Prologue =1. Abyssinia and the Sudan= :: Thesiger tells of his love for a hard life in the desert, and how he got the chance to travel into the Empty Quarter (Rub al Khali) from Middle East Locust Control. =2. Prelude in Dhaufar= :: While waiting for his Arab escorts, he travels in the Qarra mountains of Dhofar on the southern coast of the Arabian peninsula. He records that the English travellers Bertram Thomas and St. John Philby both crossed the Empty Quarter (in 1929 and 1930), and that he had read Thomas's Arabia Felix and T. E. Lawrence's Revolt in the Desert, which had provoked his interest in the Arabs. =3. The Sands of Ghanim= :: Thesiger describes how he spent five months growing used to the life of the Bedu Arabs in the region to the south of the Empty Quarter, travelling in the Sands of Ghanim and to the Hadhramaut. =4. Secret Preparations at Salala= :: On his return to Salalah (in Dhofar, Oman) a year later, he arranges to travel from south to north across the Empty Quarter with Rashid Arab help. He puts together a group of Bait Kathir Arabs to travel to Mughshin. =5. The Approach to the Empty Quarter= :: He meets up with the Rashid party at Shisur; they journey to Mughsin at the edge of the Empty Quarter. One of the Rashid falls from his camel, breaking his leg; the party is split, leaving Thesiger with only two Rashid. =6. On the Edge of the Empty Quarter= :: They take on water from a well in Ghanim and journey northwards across the sands to Ramlat al Ghafa. They know they are short of food. After four days they find a well in the desert at Khaur bin Atarit, with brackish water that was only slightly purgative. Thesiger calculates they can carry water for 20 days, that being the limit the camels can go without water, at a quart per person per day. =7. The First Crossing of the Empty Quarter= :: The party again divides. With three companions, short of both food and water, they travel across the sands of Uruq al Shaiba to the well at Khaba, near Liwa Oasis. On the way, they do not drink until sunset, when each person receives a ration of one pint of water mixed with camel's milk. On arrival, Thesiger reflects that the journey was not important, however excited he had been at the chance to do it. He feels it was a personal experience, rewarded with a drink of clean water without the usual bitter desert taste, and claims he is content with that. =8. Return to Salala= :: The party returns the long way around the gravel plains of western Oman, avoiding the desert sands. The journey is not easy as the tribes there do not trust them, and they still have little food. They keep secret the fact that Thesiger is not an Arab. =9. From Salala to Mukalla= :: After resting at Salala, Thesiger travels easily to Mukalla with the Rashid, though they post sentries as there is a strong raiding party of Dahm Arabs in the area; they hear shots but see no raiders. Once in the town, he shaves and puts on European clothes; his companions barely recognise him. =10. Preparations for a Second Crossing= :: Thesiger goes back to Arabia hoping to cross the desert further to the west, passing near the Jebel Tuwaiq mountains (south of Riyadh) without the permission of the King, Ibn Saud, and then going northeast to Abu Dhabi. He arranges to meet his Rashid companions and they prepare for the journey at the well at Manwakh. =11. The Second Crossing of the Empty Quarter= :: They travel across the western sands of the Empty Quarter to the well at Hassi and the town of Sulaiyil. The people are hostile and the party is effectively arrested and imprisoned; Thesiger sends a telegram of apology to the King. =12. From Sulaiyil to Abu Dhabi= :: In Sulaiyil, a Yam Arab shows Thesiger an English rifle, which he had taken from a man called bin Duailan, 'The Cat', whom he had killed; bin Duailan had been one of Thesiger's companions the previous year. Thesiger and his party are released; they are unable to obtain a guide at Laila, and instead travel on their own to Abu Dhabi. He is disturbed to find he is hated as a 'Christian' alien. Without a guide, Thesiger navigates the party for eight days to the next oasis at Jabrin, 150 miles to the northeast, using St. John Philby's map. They learn that two months before, raiders from Dubai had killed 52 Manasir Arabs from Abu Dhabi. =13. The Trucial Coast= :: They stay in Abu Dhabi for 20 days; Thesiger describes it as a small town with about 2000 inhabitants. They travel to Buraimi and stay there for a month with the Sheikh (Zayid bin Sultan) before journeying on to Sharja. Thesiger sails from Dubai to Bahrain in a dhow; a gale blows up, and the four-day journey takes eleven days. He comments again that travel is for him a personal venture, not to collect plants or make maps; he claims that writing or talking about it tarnishes the achievement. =14. A Holiday in Buraimi= :: Thesiger goes back to Buraimi via Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and spends a quiet time visiting the oasis at Liwa and going hawking with Sheikh Zayid. =15. The Quicksands of Umm al Samim= :: Thesiger decides to finish his travels in the Arabian peninsula by exploring the quicksands of Umm al Samim in Oman. He takes Rashid Arabs with him on the journey past the quicksands to the south coast. =16. The Wahiba Sands= :: Thesiger travels to the Wahiba sands and makes his way back, this time with permission from the Imam, to Buraimi. =17. The Closing Door= :: A year later, in 1949, he goes back to Buraimi hoping to explore the Jabal al Akhadar mountains, but the Imam of Oman refuses permission, and he leaves Arabia for what he realizes is the last time. He expresses sorrow at leaving behind something he greatly loved and was sure he would not find elsewhere. He regretted, too, the fate of his Bedu companions who would soon lose the desert for a more secure but less free world. ;Arabic and Botanical Names of Plants Mentioned in the Book ;A List of the Chief Characters on the Various Journeys Reception =Contemporary= =Modern= One of Thesiger's biographers, Michael Asher, wrote in The Guardian that \\"his description of the traditional life of the Bedu, Arabian Sands (1959), [was] probably the finest book ever written about Arabia and a tribute to a world now lost forever.\\" The critic Michael Dirda commented that \\"for years I meant to read Arabian Sands ... Now that I have, I can sheepishly join the chorus of those who revere the book as one of the half dozen greatest works of modern English travel writing.\\" He calls the book \\"the austere masterpiece\\", comparing it with Apsley Cherry-Garrard's The Worst Journey in the World, C. M. Doughty's Travels in Arabia Deserta and T. E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom. He notes that Thesiger's writing can be vivid, \\"but in general his prose is terse, declarative, coolly observational.\\" Dirda contrasts this coolness with the passion in his photographs, which \\"make clear his love for this bleak, unforgiving terrain\\" or the handsome young men such as Salim bin Ghabaisha.

The lighthouse is located on a small island about off the southern tip of the main island of Karmøy. The entrance to the harbor of the town of Skudeneshavn lies about northeast of the lighthouse. The island is accessible only by boat. The lighthouse was established in 1924 and it was automated in 1994. It was listed as a protected site in 1998. Technical specifications The tall lighthouse emits a white, red or green light, depending on direction, occulting once every six seconds. The light sits at an elevation of above sea level on top of an octagonal prism tower. The concrete masonry tower is attached to a U-shaped one-story lighthouse keeper's house. The lighthouse is painted white and the roof is red. The lighthouse also emits a racon signal, using the morse code letter \\"G\\". The racon signal can be received inside a radius of the lighthouse. History The lighthouse was established in 1924 as a replacement for Skudenes Lighthouse, which had operated from 1799 to 1924. Geitungen Lighthouse was designed by Jørgen H. Meinich, who later also designed Makkaur Lighthouse. The argument for a new location, was the need for a foghorn. The diaphone at Geitungen Lighthouse was the first diaphone installed in Norway. Geitungen was automated and depopulated in 1994, and was listed as a protected site in 1998. The protected site includes the lighthouse and three technical buildings.

A handheld microphone version was introduced in 1977. The system was the first cordless system to be adopted by major rock acts because it solved technical problems common to earlier wireless systems. The reliable sound and freedom of movement it provided paved the way for bands to tour with large multi-level stages in arenas. Schaffer- Vegas were used in the late 1970s and early 1980s by many rock bands such as Pink Floyd (namely guitarist David Gilmour), the Rolling Stones, AC/DC and Kiss. Background Early Advertisement Traveling with the Rolling Stones on the Tour of The Americas '75, New York-based engineer and radio aficionado Ken Schaffer witnessed the limitations of then-existing wireless systems and sought to develop a better system. The Schaffer-Vega Diversity System (SVDS) combined several new technologies to present a wireless system that was largely immune to the frequent signal fades, interfering signals and limited dynamic range of previous wireless systems. Guitar Player Magazine, March 1979, p. 100–101. Schaffer gave precedence to developing the first system for wireless guitar (1976) and then the wireless microphone (1977). After prototyping the wireless system, Schaffer arranged its manufacture by the Vega Corporation, based in El Monte, California. The first bands to use Schaffer- Vega Diversity System were Kiss and Electric Light Orchestra. Though wireless systems afford great mobility on stage, Kiss switched to a wireless system for safety reasons: lead guitarist Ace Frehley had been knocked unconscious by a near-fatal shock traced to a ground fault between his wired guitar connection and a metal staging element. Kiss: Ace Frehley Interview by Tom Wheeler and Steve Rosen, Guitar Player Magazine, 1979 Going wireless with all guitars and microphones eliminated this hazard. Ace Frehley: \\"I'd Love To Do An Instructional Video The Kiss Shows: July 1, 1976 – April 4, 1977 David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was also an endorsee of Schaffer Vega wireless systems. He first used it on the 1980–81 concerts for The Wall, especially when he performed \\"Comfortably Numb\\" from the top of the wall. Technical highlights The Schaffer–Vega diversity system used a space diversity method consisting of two independent VHF receivers fed by antennas placed at least one wavelength apart. Use of two full independent receivers, rather than two parallel antennas, made the Schaffer-Vega the first \\"True Diversity\\" system. The diversity technique prevented signal degradation due to multi-path cancellation. Angus Young: Seriously, by Jan Obrecht, Guitar Player Magazine, February 1984. In the Schaffer-Vega system, a comparator monitored the instantaneous RF signal strength delivered by each antenna to its dedicated receiver, that switched to the other receiver when the currently selected receiver's signal strength fell below a quieting threshold.Diversity Receivers: Musiclab Glossary of Professional Audio and Music Terms Musiclab, Australia. Retrieved February 10, 2012. The system achieved high interference rejection by using four helical resonator filters between the antenna and preamplifier stage of each receiver. This made it possible to use the systems on unused VHF television broadcast frequencies and protected the receivers from even strong spurious local signals (such as nearby police calls, taxi dispatch, etc.). Limited by the US FCC to 50 mW output, the Schaffer-Vega Diversity System maintained reliable transmission for up to 100 meters in a line of sight from transmitter to receiver.US Patent Office, Helical Resonator Filters, US Patent #/4061992, et. al. In the United States, the FCC and corresponding agencies in most ITU countries, regulations that limit the transmitter's FM frequency deviation also limited the theoretical signal-to- noise ratios and dynamic ranges of wireless systems to approximately 70 dB.Sony UTX-B2V/B2X Bodypack Transmitter Specs: Typical non-companded wireless signal-to-noise specification The Schaffer-Vega Diversity System also used companding. By compressing signal amplitude 2:1 in the transmitter and then expanding it in the receiver, it was possible for the system to deliver a signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of 100 dB. What is Audio Reference Companding?, Shure Brothers, February 20, 2006. Retrieved February 10, 2012 Use in the recording studio Although Schaffer's design objective was to create a wireless system that sounded transparent—as close as possible to the wired version—artists, such as Rick Derringer, Eddie Van Halen and Angus Young of AC/DC, chose to use their wireless units in the recording studio. The slight coloration added by the Schaffer-Vega was considered part of the desired guitar tone.Angus Young’s Guitar Sound: The Quest Formally Begins SoloDallas.com, Retrieved February 8, 2012 In 2015, the audio section of the SVDS was put into production and brought to market as a stand-alone effect by Filippo \\"SoloDallas\\" Olivieri and selected for inclusion in Guitar Player Magazine's 2015 Hall of Fame.

He was widely recognized in his day, although he was subsequently eclipsed by painters with more modern styles. Biography Édouard Joseph Dantan was born on 26 August 1848 in Paris. His grandfather, who had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, was a wood sculptor. His father, Antoine Laurent Dantan, and uncle, Jean-Pierre Dantan, were both well- known sculptors. Dantan was a pupil of Isidore Pils and Henri Lehmann at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. At the age of nineteen he won a commission for a large mural painting of The Holy Trinity for the Hospice Brezin at Marne (Seine-et-Oise). Dantan's first exhibit at the Paris Salon was An Episode in the Destruction of Pompeii in 1869. In 1870 the Franco-Prussian War interrupted his work, and he enlisted in the defence force. He was given the rank of a sergeant, and was later promoted to lieutenant. During the war the family home was burned down. In the years after the war Dantan exhibited a number of other paintings at the Salon including Hercules at the Feet of Omphale (1871), Death of Tusaphane (1875), The Nymph Salmacis (1876), Priam Demanding of Achillees the Body of Hector (1877), Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew (1878), Corner of a Studio (1880) and The Breakfast of the Model (1881). He continued to exhibit at the Salon until 1895. In 1890, 1894 and 1895 he served on the jury of the Salon. For twelve years Dantan's companion was the model Agostina Segatori, who had also posed for artists such as Jean-Baptiste Corot, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet. She bore a child to Dantan, Jean-Pierre, in 1873. On their separation, Agostina opened Café du Tambourin on the Boulevard de Clichy that became a meeting place for artists. Dantan spent his summers in Villerville, where he died on 9 July 1897 when the carriage in which he was riding crashed violently into the village church.Le Figaro (189). July 8, 1897 Style and reception Coin d'atelier (1880) At the 1870 exposition of the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts Dantan received an honorable mention for his submission for the prix de Rome. In 1874 he won a third class medal for his painting of a monk carving a Christ in wood. In 1880 he won a second class medal for his painting Un coin d'atelier (a corner of the workshop). He received a gold medal at the Paris Exposition of 1889, and a number of his paintings were bought by the French state. Dantan's works followed the academic tradition of painting, and were praised by his contemporaries. His technical mastery is illustrated by such paintings as Un coin d'atelier (1880), where he depicts his father working on a bas-relief in his studio, seen from behind. The studio is cluttered with paintings and sculptures. In the foreground, a nude woman is taking a break from modelling. A critic praised the painting for following all the rules of trompe-l'oeil and stereoscopic photography. Describing a painting of a group of sailors following a clergyman going to bless the sea, another critic said in 1881 \\"he has written a page before which believers and skeptics must raise their hats\\". His Le déjeuner du modèle exhibited in the Salon in 1881 shows a model eating a plate of eggs in a break from the posing session. The scene is illuminated by a clear white light, with a delicate sense of reflected light. One reviewer said that Dantan had treated the subject with taste and grace, when it could easily have fallen into vulgarity. He was by no means limited to one genre. Other paintings at this time included one of his mother outdoors in her invalid chair, her face sad, a pastoral portrait of a young blonde woman in a blue dress, full of life, and of a poor fisherman dining in his miserable cabin on a piece of bread and an onion. Later, Dantan's classical style fell out of fashion. Writing of the first exhibition of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in the Champ de Mars in 1890, Walter Sickert was scathingly critical of most of the paintings, making exceptions for a series of far- eastern landscapes by Louis-Jules Dumoulin, a painting by Édouard Manet, some portraits by Jules-Élie Delaunay and some studies by Dantan. He praised Dumoulin as a master, described Manet's work as brilliant and powerful, Delaunay's as respectable and Dantan's as conscientious. Major works Fête Foraine de Saint-Cloud (1879) Un Coin du Salon en 1880 At first, Dantan's subjects were mainly drawn from classical mythology or religious subjects, as was common in his day. Later he made a number of paintings of scenes from sculpture workshops, familiar from his childhood. He also painted portraits and views of Villerville. *1869 Episode of the destruction of Pompeii *1872 The Trinity, chapel of the Hospital in Brezen-on-the-Marne *1872 Portrait His father, working on a marble bust *1874 Hercules at the feet of Omphale *1874 A monk as a wood sculptor, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes *1875 The Quoit- Thrower, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, Rouen *1876 The Nymph Salmacis *1878 Phrosine et Mélidore after Pierre Paul Prud'hon, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux *1879 Fête Foraine de Saint-Cloud *1880 Christ on the Cross, Church of Dombrowa, Poland *1880 Un Coin d'atelier, Paris, Palais du Luxembourg (filed in 1925, not found in 1977) *1880 Un Coin du Salon de 1880 (sale Sotheby's New York, 24 May 1995) *1881 Le déjeuner du modèle *1882 Corpus Christi Day *1884 Burial of a child, Villerville, Musée Malraux, Le Havre *1885 Shooting their nets *1886 Entracte Un à la Comedie-Francaise de première un soir, en 1885, Comédie-Française, Paris *1887 Un moulage sur Nature, Konstmuseum Gothenburg, Gothenburg *1887 L'Atelier du sculptor Gallery File:Dantan21.jpg A monk as a wood sculptor (1874) File:Edouard Dantan Phrosine et Mélidore after Prud'hon.jpgPhrosine et Mélidore (1878) File:Danta 12.jpgPortrait (ca 1880) File:Dantan 13.jpgPortrait (ca 1880) File:Edouard Dantan Enterrement d'un enfant à Villerville.jpgBurial of a child, Villerville (1884) File:Edouard Dantan A Casting from Life.jpgA Casting from Life (1887) File:Sculptor Dantan.jpgSculptor File:Studioscene by Edouard Dantan.jpgStudioscene (ca 1890) File:Une Restauration by Edouard Dantan.jpgA Restoration (1891) File:Dantan portrait1.jpgPortrait (ca 1890) Recent exhibitions *\\"Édouard Dantan, de l'atelier à la lumière\\" Manoir de Villers, Saint-Pierre-de-Manneville, Normandy Impressionist Festival 2010 References ;Notes ;Citations ;Sources     * * External links * Category:1848 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Artists from Paris Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters ","title":"Édouard Joseph Dantan"},{"id":"34606317","text":"Saeed Salem Saleh Salem Al Kathiri, also called Saeed Al Kathiri (; born 28 March 1988Profile in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), is an Emirati footballer who plays as a defender.

Mission SADD’s mission is to empower young people to successfully confront the risks and pressures that challenge them throughout their daily lives. Profile SADD's approach involves young people presenting education and prevention messages to their peers through school and community activities. Projects include peer-led classes and forums, teen workshops, conferences and rallies, prevention education and leadership training, awareness-raising activities and legislative work. As of 2012, there are nearly 10,000 Middle school, high school, and college chapters with SADD advisors. There are 350,000 students actively participating (\\"members\\") in SADD chapters. History SADD was founded by Robert Anastas at Wayland High School in Massachusetts in 1981. He and a group of 15 students developed the SADD concept and the Contract for Life. In 1982, SADD went national with offices founded throughout Massachusetts, Arizona, Ohio, North Carolina, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maine. In 1984, Dear Abby and Ann Landers printed the Contract for Life, suggesting to all readers that they request a copy from SADD. The SADD National office was inundated with 8,000 requests per week for six weeks. Also that year, \\"Contract for Life: The SADD Story\\" aired on CBS as a CBS Schoolbreak Special, and Carl Olsen, the first SADD president at Wayland High School, was appointed by the Director of Health and Human Services as the only student to a three-year panel studying the alcoholism in America. The following year, SADD offices were established in Germany and Guam. Also in 1985, SADD had its first presidential moment when President Reagan met with SADD students of River Dell High School in New Jersey. In 1989, SADD offices were established in schools in the Soviet Union. Also that year, the SADD National Board of Directors voted to cease accepting contributions from the alcohol industry. In 1990, The American College of Physicians awarded the Edward G. Loveland Memorial Award to SADD for its contributions to the health field. In 1992. William Cullinane became Executive Director of SADD. The following year, the SADD Board of Directors voted not to accept funds from the alcohol industry. In 1995, SADD received a letter of commendation from President Bill Clinton. The next year, Margaret Altstaetter, SADD Student of the Year 1995-1996, was invited to participate in the White House Leadership Conference on Youth, Drug Use and Violence. In 2018, First Lady Melania Trump addressed the SADD National Conference. As part of her Be Best campaign, Mrs. Trump spoke on the importance of kindness, compassion, and positivity. In 2019, SADD received a grant from the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) for $311,000. The grant was awarded to focus on educating the community on the dangers of impaired driving. Chapters ;Name Change A new name was adopted in 1997: Students Against Destructive Decisions. In 1999, three Student Leadership Council members, Lynsey Ross, Jereme McBride, and Carrie LeBlanc, were appointed to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy Leadership Team. SADD's Board of Directors appointed Penny Wells as its new President and Executive Director in 2000. SADD launched its National Scholarship Program in 2002, awarding its first two scholarships the following year. In 2004, Jacqueline Hackett, Executive Committee member of the 2003-2004 SADD National SLC, testified before the Congressional Subcommittee on Education Reform at the hearing \\"Preventing Underage Drinking: What Works?\\" In 2007, SADD attended a special White House event during which President George W. Bush highlighted a decline in youth drug use from 2001 to 2007. In 2008, SADD partnered with the White House's National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to raise awareness about the link between stress and drug use among teens and about prescription drug use. By 2009, the SADDvocate, SADD's monthly e-newsletter for students and advisors, had reached more than 11,000 subscribers. In 2010 SADD successfully lobbied for the introduction of the STARS (Students Taking Action for Road Safety) Act. In October, SADD received an international drug abuse prevention award from the Queen of Sweden.

It is to be connected to the rail network via the line of the former South Yorkshire Joint Railway, and from an extension of the former Rossington Colliery branch from the East Coast Main Line. The development includes a intermodal rail terminal to be built on green belt land, of which over was to be developed into warehousing, making it the largest rail terminal in Yorkshire; the development also included over of countryside, the majority of which was to remain in agricultural use, with other parts used for landscaping, and habitat creation as part of environment mitigation measures. History In 2006 developer HelioSlough began a public consultation around their proposals to create a rail freight depot west of Rossington. In 2007 the Rossington Eco Town Partnership, an association of Rossington Forward, Rossington Development Trust, and local landowners and property developers UK Coal, Persimmon Homes, Helios Properties and Rossington Hall Ltd. presented plans to build a large 'eco town' development over a 20-year timespan of ten to fifteen thousand homes on land to the south and west of Rossington. The plan included redevelopment of the Rossington Colliery site, and included as part of the employment proposals the plan from Helios Properties for an Inland port. The development, which would have used significant amounts of agricultural land was opposed by a large majority of local residents. The project was shortlisted as one of 15 potential sites in the UK for a new town development in 2008, by 2009 the scope of the plan had been reduced to a five thousand home 'eco-village'. In 2009 developer HelioSlough submitted a planning application for a $516 million rail terminal with of warehousing; the plan represented the largest rail logistics development in Yorkshire, and was to be operated and part funded by Hutchinson Ports. The application, which included development on green belt land was approved by Doncaster Council but opposed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England, and four parish councils. In January 2010 local MPs MP Caroline Flint (Don Valley) and Jeffrey Ennis (Barnsley East and Mexborough) voiced their support for the plan.Sources:  In March 2010 the UK government decided that no public enquiry would be needed for the project. In June 2011 developers Helios Europe, Shepherd Aligned and SEGRO entered into a joint agreement to develop the site, which would be road connected via the £18 million Finningley and Rossington Regeneration Route Scheme (FARRRS) road scheme, and be built for international trade, with customs clearance. In September 2011 planning consent was given for the rail port; construction of the facility was initially planned to begin in 2012. The tendering process for a rail operator of the port was begun in 2012: DB Schenker Rail UK, ABP, Stobart Group and Freightliner were listed as potential operators. Hutchinson Whampoa had also been reported as a potential rail operator in 2011. In 2013 the successor company to Helios Europe, Verdion obtained financial backing for its projects through Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP). HOOPP planned to invest €1 billion in European logistics facilities through Verdion including the £400 million \\"iPort Doncaster\\" development. Work on the FARRRS connecting road began in late 2013. =Site development plan= The railport lies directly adjacent to and south, west, and east of the M18 motorway, Rossington Colliery and spoil heaps, and former South Yorkshire Joint Railway respectively. Historically the land was entirely agricultural, known as Little Moor, and part of Potteric Carr; Potteric Carr farm was located in the northwestern portion of the site. The land is low lying, about 5m above sea level, and was drained by man made cuts.Ordnance Survey, 1:10560 and 10000 maps, 1854–1992 Potteric Carr Nature Reserve is to the north of the site. The entire site covers , of which is used for the development, is access land, and is countryside. Construction of the first phase was estimated to take 2 years including roads and rail access, of warehousing and rail terminal; with further warehousing constructed at a development rate of approximately per year; the entire project was estimated to be complete in 8 years. The rail terminal is planned to connect to the rail network via both the single track freight only (since 1929) former South Yorkshire Joint Railway (SYJR) (northward and southward connections), and from an extension of the former Rossington Colliery branch off the East Coast Main Line. The terminal is to be built to handle containerised (ISO Container, Swap body), and wagon-load trains, with a capacity of 20 trains per day. The connection from the SYJR would be the primary route to the facility, which would have 4 reception sidings and 5 handling sidings, as well as all distribution warehouses rail connected, with addition lines for damaged wagons, and locomotive storage. Gauging enhancements to loading gauge W10 are planned for connecting lines, with construction design allowing overhead electrification at a later date. The track plan allows train lengths of up to , with siding lengths between ; trains over would be handled by an on site shunter. In addition to the rail terminal, track work, and road access further civil engineering works was required as part of the plan, mainly environmental mitigation, including diversion of St. Catherine's Well Stream, landscaping, flood mitigation and drainage, footpaths, cyclepaths and bridleways. Developer estimates of job creation were over 4,000 jobs net created on site as a direct result when fully operational., alt link via Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council =Construction and development= Construction work (2016) Verdion began the construction of a c. and a warehousing unit in May 2015; erection of the warehousing's frames began in November 2015. In April 2016 Fellowes acquired a warehouse space, also to function as the company's new UK headquarters. After some testing in late 2017, the site officially opened to railway traffic in February 2018, however, regular freight trains did not start until 12 September 2018 when Princess Anne officially unveiled the new terminal. A week later, container trains from Southampton were arriving at the site at a rate of one per day site. From April 2019, the iPort is also served by two trains daily from Teesport. The terminal is also now served by two trains daily to and from the Port of Felixstowe. All of these trains are operated by GB Railfreight.

History This school was founded in 1877 for the children of the Railway Colony and now also serves the Raniganj coal belt and the industrial area of Kulti in Asansol. The first five Sisters came with Mother Delphine Hart in response to a request from the Jesuit parish priest, Fr. Martin Jacques (1835-1890). They began the school with 35 pupils in a small bungalow near the presbytery. Boys and girls were admitted at first. Later the present property was acquired, and in 1885 a boarding school for girls only was started in a three-story building facing the railway tank. The top floor was damaged by the 1897 Assam earthquake and had to be demolished leaving the present two stories. Between 1909 and 1928 other wings were added for classrooms and dormitories. The students were prepared for the Junior and Senior Cambridge examinations. In 1942 the school building was requisitioned by the military for a hospital and the 12 Sisters and 75 boarders went to live in rented houses in Simla till 1946. In 1953 the Modern School Final exam replaced the Junior Cambridge, and the first batch of students was sent up for the Pitmans Commercial exam. There were now 221 girls and 90 boys in the primary school. In 1962 the foundations were laid for another school building – the present secondary school wing and in 1977 the new Primary wing, Mary Ward building, was begun. From 1963 boys were no longer admitted. In 1971 Mother Magdalena opened a small dispensary in the presbytery premises and it flourished, with a daily attendance of at least 100 poor people till she was no longer able to work in 1984. In 1974 the new ICSE pattern was introduced and in 1983 the beginning of the academic year was changed from January to March. The Class 11 (ISC) was introduced but had to be discontinued in 1985 due to insufficient pupils for the Arts course offered. In 1991 the hostel was closed. A parallel school for under-privileged children was begun in 1992, Ankur Vidyalaya, and in 1994 knitting and tailoring classes were also started. In 2001 the former dormitory became a temporary home for 23 Santhal girls who were school dropouts and were prepared for a year to join regular classes again. 2001/2002 saw a year-long celebration of 125 years of the school's existence. The old building has been reconstructed.

Cedar Valley borders the southeast of the Escalante Desert, at its north and northwest. Cedar City, Utah lies in the valley's center and east, at the foothills of the Hurricane Cliffs. Description Cedar Valley is northeast trending. It narrows in the southwest, between mountain ranges; in this southwest section, the Harmony Mountains are west, and the Hurricane Cliffs are east, bordering the Kolob Terrace. The valley is mostly about Utah DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer, p. 49. wide, between mountains, or ranges, or the Hurricane Cliffs, to the east, which is a 75-mi long landform, from Hurricane, Utah at its southwest end. The valley's north and northwest terminus merges into the Mud Spring Wash-Rush Lake region at the southwest of the Black Mountains (Utah), (and the southeast perimeter of the Escalante Desert); a ridgeline extending southwest from the Black Mountains parallels the Hurricane Cliffs, and its terminus is at the north end of Cedar Valley (and Rush Lake). Between the ridgeline, and Hurricane Cliffs, east, Interstate 15 traverses, (only about 1-mi wide,Utah DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer, p. 49. adjacent the site of Summit).

At the valley's north- northwest terminus, Mud Spring Wash flows northwest into the Escalante Desert. The intermittent dry lake, Rush Lake is at its origin; Rush Lake is adjacent the ridgeline southwest from the Black Mountains, and at the downhill region of the alluvial fan, Long Hollow.  Access  Interstate (I-15) traverses almost the entire length of the valley starting at the southwest, follows the valley's east, against the Hurricane Cliffs, and exits between the Cliffs and a ridgeline southeast from the Black Mountains. I-15 enters the southwest of Parowan Valley. From the north, Utah State Route 130 (SR-130) travels due- south from Minersville through the Black Mountains, then a stretch through Long Hollow, an alluvial foothill section between two ridgelines of the Black Mountains, the foothills/alluvial fan area meeting the north terminus of Cedar Valley. SR-130, joins I-15 just north of Cedar City. Utah State Route 56 (SR-56) crosses the valley center, east-west. The route enters the center- southwest Cedar Valley region, and the route lies between the Antelope Range, north, and the Harmony Mountains, south. The route comes from Iron Mountain, Utah, and Iron Mountain Wye, in the mountains. In the Antelope Range, north, Iron Spring Road meets the valley center-northwest; the route comes from Iron Mountain, located between off-lying peaks east of the Antelope Range.

Plot Al Munch (Bud Tingwell) is an American private eye who served in Sydney during World War II and decided to stay on. He is hired by Hollywood film producer, Frankoff, to find Joe Barton, an American crime figure thought to be dead but who is now said to be alive in Australia.

Although television was not introduced in Australia until 1956, she wanted to make a show for the American market using an Australian cast and crew, but American writers and directors. There were a number of Australian radio serials at the time about American characters. Gibson originally got Ken G. Hall to direct Alan White in a test scene and sent to it some American colleagues but they were not impressed. American director Francis D.

Tingwell was eventually cast and the film was shot over ten days.Don Storey, 'Interview with Charles Tingwell', TV Eye, No. 4, February 1995http://www.australianbiography.gov.au/subjects/tingwell/interview4.html There was emphasis on Australian flora and fauna: Frankof has a pet koala in his room, Munch travels by boat across Sydney harbour, there are plenty of gum trees and kangaroos. Reception The series did not sell to American television. Tingwell claims this is because they wanted Gibson to guarantee 39 episodes in 39 weeks and she was not sure she would be able to fulfil this order. However, it did sell to an American distributor and play as a self- contained episode on independent TV stations in the US. In Australia it screened as a support feature in cinemas.

He currently plays for Khonkaen. Early life Cardozo was born in Sydney, Australia. He was born to his Uruguayan father and his Argentinian mother. He grew up speaking Spanish at home, and is also fluent in French and English. Cardozo has one older brother, former Socceroo Pablo Cardozo. Playing career Cardozo was selected for every representative team growing up; including New South Wales School Boys, New South Wales Under 14's, New South Wales Under 15's, and New South Wales Under 16's. He was also selected into the New South Wales Institute of Sport as a scholarship holder, and made the Under 16's and Under 17's Australian Team where he captained two games, won Top Goal Scorer for the World Cup Qualifiers, and represented Australia in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. = 2003 and the NSL = Richie made his NSL debut at 17 years old in 2003 for Sydney Olympic in the final season of the NSL before it became the A-League. At such a young age, Richie was earmarked by coaches and scouts to be the next big thing in Australian Football. However, with the collapse of the NSL, and the establishment of the new A-League, Cardozo's career was stalled, and he missed out on both a contract in the A-League, and the Under 20's World Cup in the Netherlands in 2005. =2007= After spells in the New South Wales Premier League, the Victorian Premier League, and the New Zealand National League, Cardozo signed a contract with Swiss third division team FC Bex in February 2007. After a stint that covered both the 06–07, and 07–08 seasons, he returned to Melbourne to play in the Victorian Premier League. =2008 – 2011= For the 2008 and 2009 season, Cardozo played for Richmond. He then moved to Hume City for the 2010 and 2011 season. Over the four years that he played in the Victorian Premier League, Carodozo scored 54 goals. In the 2011 Victorian Premier League season he was crowned top scorer in the league with 19 goals and won Media Player of the Year. =2012= In January 2012, he signed with Austrian Football First League club LASK. on a 2 and a half year deal. LASK Linz never lost a game with Cardozo playing that season, and a push for promotion to the Austrian Bundesliga fell slightly short. Unfortunately at the end of that season off field indiscretions by the club resulted in LASK being relegated to the 3rd tier of Austrian Football by the Austrian Federation, and Cardozo and LASK mutually terminated the remaining 2 years of his contract. =2013= In 2013, Cardozo returned to his home town of Sydney for the inaugural revamped National Premier League and played a major role in leading Rockdale City Suns to a Grand Final Birth. It was yet again a successful season for Cardozo, being selected in the starting 11 for the team of the year, and also netting 17 season goals to win the very first Golden boot for the NSW NPL and in doing so becoming the first and only player to win the Golden boot In both the NSW and VIctorian Premier Leagues. =2013/2014= In the Southern Summer, he returned to New Zealand and his former club in Waitakere United. Cardozo finished the season as the league's second top goalscorer. =2014= Hume City. Cardozo yet again linked up with a former team in Hume City for the 2014 season. It was a below par season for Cardozo by his standards, as he took over the captaincy of the side due to a long-term injury to the team's first choice skipper. Playing a different role and position within the team for most of the season, Cardozo found it more difficult to make his customary impact, scoring less goals than previous years. Frustration grew, rumours of a major contractual dispute and mis-management by the club surfaced for the third successive stint with Hume City. A tag that has haunted the organisation on many occasions for many years, and along with a desire to return to play professionally overseas again, ultimately led to the apparent reason for Cardozo's departure. =2016= In 2016, Cardozo joined Manly United in the NSW Premier League. Playing his first game of the season with Manly he scored a goal against Mounties Wanderers to advance Manly to the next round in the FFA cup. Cardozo ended his campaign with 10 goals in all competitions. Despite only playing half the season Cardozo finished as one of the league's leading goalscorers and helping Manly United to a Waratah cup final, FFA cup round of 32 and play off berth. =International career= Cardozo has represented Australia at U/17 level, and went to the FIFA U/17 World Championships in Finland 2003.

The primary deities have been brought in from India, 51-inch high statues of Mahavir and Adinath. Behind the primary deities, 24 inches have been carved out to include 15-inch-high statues of tirthankars. Above the sanctum sanctorum, a 61 feet pinnacle or shikhara has been constructed. The entrance of the temple includes a sandstone archway and a 41-foot Manastambha (nonviolence monument) stands outside the temple.

It is a volcanic lake with a diameter of about . There is a small island in the middle, which is densely inhabited by the Barombi, a tribe of fishers. The Tung Nsuia and Tung Nsuria streams, each about wide and deep near their mouth, are the only inflows into the lake, and they dry out in dry season. Biology Lake Barombi Koto often appears green-brown because it is rich in phytoplankton. Invertebrates, turtles and the aquatic frog Xenopus tropicalis are common in the lake, which is also an important sanctuary for birds.Hughes, R.H., and J.S. Hughes (1992). A Directory of African Wetlands. Pp. 474–475. Seven fish species are known from the lake, including Enteromius callipterus and a Clarias catfish, while the remaining all are cichlids: Coptodon kottae, Chromidotilapia guentheri, Hemichromis fasciatus, Pelmatolapia mariae and Sarotherodon galilaeus. Of these, C. guentheri is represented by the endemic subspecies loennbergi, while C. kottae is entirely endemic to this lake and the smaller Lake Mboandong. A review in 2008 was unable to confirm the distinction of the subspecies loennbergi compared to C. guentheri elsewhere, but the H. fasciatus in Barombi Koto and Lake Mboandong are unusually small and might be an endemic undescribed species. The endemics are threatened by pollution and sedimentation from human activities, and \\"turning\\" of the lake's water because of deforestation of the surroundings (this may allow more wind, and the lake is stratified with oxygen-poor lower levels). They are potentially also threatened by large emissions of carbon dioxide from the lake's bottom (compare Lake Nyos), although Barombi Koto is too shallow to contain very high amounts of this gas.Freeth, S.J.; C.O. Ofoegbu; and K.M. Onuoha (1992). Natural Hazards in West and Central Africa, pp. 50–51. The nothobranchiids Aphyosemion bivittatum, Epiplatys sexfasciatus and Fundulopanchax oeseri, the poeciliid Procatopus similis, and Barbus callipterus are found in the Tung Nsuia and Tung Nsuria streams. Bulinus snails (including the near-endemic B. camerunensis) infested with Schistosoma, which causes the disease bilharzia in humans, are present in the lake.Atemnkeng, A. F., K. J. N. Ndamukong, N. N. Ntonifor, and J. Mbuh (2006). Life cycle, population dynamics and schistosome infection in Bulinus spp. from a crater lake in the South West Province of Cameroon. Journal of the Cameroon Academy of Science 6(2): 99–105 Lake Mboandong About south of Lake Barombi Koto is the even smaller Lake Mboandong, another shallow crater lake with a diameter of about . There is no inflow and the only outflow is a small stream during the wet season. Lake Mboandong is less rich in phytoplankton and has less fish species, but all are species shared with Lake Barombi Koto and its inflowing streams: Aphyosemion bivittatum, Fundulopanchax oeseri, Coptodon kottae, Hemichromis fasciatus and Sarotherodon galilaeus. Members of the Barombi tribe that live at Lake Barombi Koto sometimes visit Lake Mboandong to fish.

Lipscomb, Jr. (September 1, 1935 - ) is an American lawyer, former postal clerk and politician from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who served four terms as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and one partial term in the Wisconsin State Senate.\\"Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848-1999 Legislative Reference Bureau Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999; pp. 11, 76 Background Lipscomb was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 1, 1935. He graduated from Marquette University High School, and earned a B.S. in business administration from Marquette University in 1957 (he was a track athlete, specializing in the half-mile run and president of the track club). He served in the Marines from 1957 to 1960, then got a LL.B. from Marquette's law school in 1964. In addition to his law practice, he has worked as a postal clerk, and belonged to the United Federation of Postal Clerks. Public office In 1964 Lipscomb ran for the Assembly's first Milwaukee County District (the 1st Ward of the City of Milwaukee, and the 6th Ward of the City of Glendale). After unseating incumbent Stan Pelecky with a plurality in a six-way Democratic primary election (36.9% to Pelecky's 29.6%), he was unopposed in the general election. He was assigned to the standing committees on finance and third reading (chairing the latter), and to Wisconsin Legislative Council special joint committees to study Wisconsin's civil service and Milwaukee County's children's court system (chairing the latter).Theobald, H. Rupert, ed. The Wisconsin Blue Book Madison, 1966; pp. 49, 359, 360, 370, 513, 742, 757, 829, 830. He was unopposed in the 1966 primary, and beat his Republican opponent Herbert Schollmeyer 7054 to 2086.Theobald, H. Rupert; Robbins, Patricia V., eds. The Wisconsin 1968 Blue Book Madison, 1968; pp. 49, 714, 726. After an easy win in the 1970 primary, he again defeated Schollmeyer in the general election, by a larger margin.Theobald, H. Rupert; Robbins, Patricia V., eds. The State of Wisconsin 1970 Blue Book Madison: Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, distributed by Document Sales, 1970; pp. 804, 819. In 1971, Lipscomb ran for the 6th District State Senate seat vacated when Martin J. Schreiber was elected Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin. He won his March 2 primary with 3445 votes to 2828 for fellow State Representative Paul Sicula. In the April 6 special general election, he won easily, with 6709 votes to 1735 for Republican James Mallas. Lipscomb (a strong unicameralist), tried to take his office as Senator while retaining his Assembly seat, arguing that \\"I might have stayed as chairman of the (Assembly) Judiciary Committee. I had the second-most number of bills in committee. I had a pact with Paul Sicula that we could get all the bills out. I could have gone over to sit in Schreiber's seat. Almost everything in the Senate is by acclamation. I could have sat there and kept track of everything going on in the Assembly.\\"Mueller, H. Carl. \\"Senate Refuses To Seat Lipscomb\\" Milwaukee Sentinel April 21, 1971; p. 1, col. 1. Lipscomb ran unsuccessfully in the spring of 1972 for Milwaukee city attorney, and actively lobbied to make sure that the revised 6th District was one which reflected the increased number of African-Americans in Milwaukee County. In the Senate, Lipscomb faced a drastically changed district. In the wake of the decennial legislative redistricting, it had a very different composition.Theobald, H. Rupert; Robbins, Patricia V., eds. The State of Wisconsin 1972 Blue Book Madison: Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, distributed by Document Sales, 1970; p. 120. (map of old district) In a racially charged atmosphere, Lipscomb (who had said the 60%-black district deserved a black senator \\"but not yet, because I'm running\\") lost the Democratic nomination to long-time community activist Monroe Swan, who mustered a plurality in a three-way race, with 3256 votes for Swan, 2729 for Lipscomb, and 987 for Roger Hansen.Morrison, Walter W. \\"Defeat of Lipscomb Shows Blacks' Political Know-How\\" Milwaukee Journal September 13, 1972; pt. 2, pp. 1, 4.Theobald, H.

Lipscomb unsuccessfully challenged the primary results, alleging fraud, including assertions that Hansen (a white bakery employee) was a fraudulent candidate recruited and supported by the Swan campaign to dilute the white vote in the race in return for money or a job.\\"Lipscomb Seeks New Primary Vote\\" Milwaukee Sentinel October 3, 1972; pt. 1, p. 4, cols. 1-3.\\"Lipscomb Told To Verify Charges Against Swan\\" Milwaukee Journal January 5, 1973; p. 22, cols. 1-3. Swan would eventually lose his office due to a felony conviction for election fraud in another race. After the Senate Lipscomb returned to the practice of law; he has served as a local prosecutor in River Hills and Brown Deer. In his college days at Marquette, he was a track athlete, specializing in the half-mile run (now 800 meters).

The organization developed as a way for African American women to show support for \\"Jane Roe\\" (Norma Leah Nelson McCorvey) in Roe vs. Wade. Faye Wattleton was one of the first major supporters of the organization. This group's intent was to alter the perception of abortion not being a choice for African-American women, who they argued faced additional stigma and judgement for seeking out a legal abortion. Their arguments mentioned the history of rape, torture, and other forms of abuse suffered by African-American women, stating that it was not fair and that this led to them being continually marginalized and treated as if they couldn't think for themselves. Declaration brochure In 1989, before officially forming an organization, a group of 16 African American women, and one man, all affiliated with major organizations in the country, released a declaration brochure supporting pro-choice reproductive rights.

It is notable as the first horror fiction text longer than a short story and has also been claimed by some academics as the first novel ever published in English of any kind.Ringler, William A. and Michael Flachmann eds. \\"Preface.\\" Beware the Cat. San Marino: Huntington Library, 1988. Publication history The work languished unpublished after 1553, due to the change in the political climate under Mary Tudor, but it was published, perhaps with some revision, in 1561 in an edition suppressed by the state, now lost. Another edition appeared in 1570 now only known via a Victorian era transcript, apart from four pages which still exist and another in 1584. The work was dedicated to the actor John Young. The 1570 quarto edition is entitled: A MARVELOVS hystory intitulede, Beware the Cat. Conteynyng diuerse wounderfull and incredible matters. Uery pleasant and mery to read. On publication in its 1570 edition it was subject to an anonymous poetic riposte of 56 lines, \\"A shorte Answere to the boke called: Beware the Cat\\", which rebukes the author for making fun of the narrator Master Gregory Streamer (who is not otherwise known to have really existed). The novel survived the centuries, and was published in Typographical Antiquities (1786) as a fine example of black-letter printing. It was also known in mid-Victorian times, since it was published by the Chetham Society in their volume Remains, Historical & Literary (1860). It received almost no attention from literary scholars, although William P. Holden produced an obscure edition in the original archaic English, issued from Connecticut College in 1963. A full scholarly edition only appeared in 1988 (Ringler and Flachmann), after which some further scholarly papers appeared. The text of some versions is accompanied by paratextual notes by the alleged author/narrator, which run down the page, and which at key plot points attempts to explicate the author's opinions on women's roles in society, the practice of magic, and cats. Plot There is an anti-Catholic undercurrent in the plot (with one later scholar claiming that the \\"cats\\" symbolised \\"Catholics\\"), but many of the allusions are now lost and many such aspects of the book may not even be noticed by modern readers. The initial setting is in London in the reign of Edward VI. The story is framed by the oration of an embedded first-person narrator on a cold Christmas night, one Master Streamer, who recounts a complex cycle of interlinked stories to two of his friends as they share his bed. These stories feature a version of \\"The King of the Cats\\", an Irish werewolf, the Grimalkin, and an underworld society of talking cats, among several other horror and magical/supernatural elements such as an ancient book of forbidden lore and magic potions. The use of dialogue is highly advanced for the time, the characters are clearly drawn, and the description of the London streets is vivid (such as a unique account of a Tudor printing house and its yard at Aldersgate). The subtlety of the anti-Catholic sentiment also sets it apart as a knowing piece of effective propaganda. The first two sections are essentially horror stories, and the book is then lightened with a third and more comedic section. In its structure the book resembles the ring composition method found in fairy tales and preliterate storytelling. A later (1584) edition of the text included a poem entitled 'T.K To the Reader' which makes more overt the anti-Catholic sentiments. This possibly gave that particular version of the text a more political reading than Baldwin had originally intended. Adaptations An abridged and rewritten version in modern English by David Haden, was published in his Tales of Lovecraftian Cats (2010) along with Haden's adaptations of public domain horror stories by other authors. A one-hour performance of Beware the Cat was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, in 2019. It was brought to life by researchers at the University of Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam and Sussex, and included artwork by Penny McCarthy.

The suit, Ahlquist v. Cranston, was filed with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union, and was ultimately decided in Ahlquist's favor. During the lawsuit, Ahlquist received hate mail and was verbally attacked by her peers, media outlets, and online. She received death threats, and required police escorts to and from classes. On the day following the ruling, Rhode Island State Representative Peter G. Palumbo spoke on a local radio show and referred to Ahlquist as \\"an evil little thing\\". Since the lawsuit, Ahlquist has received a variety of media attention, and she has been an invited speaker at a number of events, including the Reason Rally, the Texas Freethought Convention and Skepticon 5. Two high school students from other states have described their objections to school prayer as inspired by her activism. She has received a number of awards, including the 2011 Thomas Jefferson Youth Activist and the American Humanist Association's 2012 Humanist Pioneer Award. Early life Jessica Ahlquist was born in 1995, and lives in Cranston, Rhode Island. She is the oldest of four children and the daughter of a firefighter and nurse. Ahlquist had been raised religious, but after her mother fell ill, she began to identify as an atheist. She describes herself as \\"a nerd\\" who loves Harry Potter and Facebook. When asked if the court case inspired her to get into law, she responded that law might be her future. Ahlquist is the niece of writer, artist and humanist Steve Ahlquist. Lawsuit In July 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter to the school superintendent on behalf of an unnamed parent who complained about a banner at the school which contained a \\"school prayer.\\" After reading about the complaint, Ahlquist decided to sit in on the school board meetings. She also created a Facebook page to raise support for the cause. At an August 2010 meeting of the Cranston School Committee, a subcommittee was asked to make recommendations about the disposition of the banner; Ahlquist attended the public meetings of the subcommittee in November 2010 and February 2011. At the end of the November meeting, out of safety concerns, a police escort was provided for Ahlquist and one other person who spoke in favor of the banner's removal. At a contentious meeting of the full committee, she argued the case for the removal of the banner and a similar display at Bain Middle School. The committee voted 4-3 in favor of keeping the banner in place, despite a budget deficit and the threat of an ACLU lawsuit. A lawsuit was filed in April 2011, with Ahlquist as the plaintiff.\\" ACLU Files Suit Over Cranston School Prayer Banner\\" . American Civil Liberties Union. April 4, 2011 The Cranston School Committee had made defense arrangements with Joseph V. Cavanagh, Jr. and The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which represented them without charge. In the January 11, 2012 Ahlquist v. Cranston ruling, District Court Judge Ronald R. Lagueux of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ruled that a \\"School Prayer\\" banner posted in Cranston High School West was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, in part based on the United States Supreme Court's earlier rulings in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), Lynch v. Donnelly (1984), and Lee v. Weisman (1992), and ordered its removal. On February 16, 2012, the Cranston School Committee decided not to appeal by a 5-2 vote. The banner was removed, intact, during the first weekend in March, and the school and city agreed to pay the ACLU $150,000 in legal fees. =Threats= During the lawsuit, Ahlquist received hatemail and was verbally attacked by her peers, media outlets, and online. She received death threats, and required police escorts to and from classes. An unnamed student was disciplined by the school because of threats. The Freedom from Religion Foundation ordered flowers to be delivered to Ahlquist during the trial, but two local florists refused delivery. The group has filed a complaint with Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and given Ahlquist $13,000 from support and scholarship funds. On the day following the ruling, Rhode Island State Representative Peter G. Palumbo spoke on a local radio show and referred to Ahlquist as \\"an evil little thing\\". In response, her supporters began selling T-shirts with the words \\"Evil little thing\\" on the front. They committed the proceeds to a college education fund established for her. The fund raised over $62,000 which was presented to her at the Reason Rally on March 24, 2012, where she was an invited speaker. Ahlquist was also awarded the Humanist Pioneer Award from the American Humanist Association. In 2013, she received a Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in the education category. Religious leaders from the Rhode Island State Council of Churches rallied to defend Ahlquist and condemn the language used to describe her. After the lawsuit Ahlquist's uncle, humanist writer/artist Steve Ahlquist, conducted an hour-long interview with Ahlquist on March 31, 2011.Alquist, Steve (March 31, 2011).

Several months after the case was closed, in April 2012, Ahlquist received threatening letters in the mail from individuals describing themselves as \\"crusaders\\". Police are still investigating. Ahlquist was an invited speaker at a number of events in 2012, spanning at least five US states and international media. She speaks at approximately one venue each month, including the Reason Rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. on March 24, 2012, the largest gathering of atheists in history, alongside Richard Dawkins, Adam Savage, Eddie Izzard, Paul Provenza, PZ Myers, Dan Barker and James Randi.

She also spoke at the Texas Freethought Convention in 2012. Ahlquist is a frequent and popular guest on Freethought RI, a weekly radio show produced by the RI Atheist Society. On June 25, 2011 she was a speaker at Center for Inquiry transnational in Amherst, New York and on February 6, 2012 in Mesa Arts Center, Mesa, Arizona, professor Richard Dawkins specifically discussed the threats Jessica Ahlquist had been receiving.

It is located west-southwest of Yoder, Kansas. It was closed for all military use in 1968. It was operated alongside Hutchinson Air National Guard Base when it was operational. History In 1951 the United States Air Force Air Defense Command selected a portion of the then- closed World War II NAS Hutchinson facility as a site for one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent ADC general radar surveillance network for the United States. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on 11 July 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary’s approval on 21 July, the Air Force directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction of a radar station on the eastern part of the ground station, about a mile from the runways and ramp/hangars being used by the Navy when it reactivated its facilities. On 1 May 1951, the 793d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was activated at Hutchinson Air Force Station (AFS) (P-47), the radar site on the facility. In May 1952, the 793 AC&W; Sq began operating a pair of AN/FPS-10 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. During 1958, an AN/FPS-3 search radar saw duty and a pair of AN/FPS-6A height-finder radars were installed. By late 1959, Hutchinson AFS was performing air traffic control duties for the Federal Aviation Administration. At this time the site operated an AN/FPS-20 search radar. In the early 1960s, this radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66. During late January 1961, Hutchinson AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to Site DC-22 at Sioux City AFS, Iowa. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 793d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 February 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7/365 to the SAGE Direction Center, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-47. By 1963, height-finding duties were being performed by AN/FPS-6A radars, and one was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 in 1964. In addition to the main facility, Hutchinson operated two AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Ellsworth, KS (P-47A) * Wilsey, KS (P-47B) The 793rd Radar Squadron was inactivated on 8 September 1968, primarily due to budget reductions. With its closure the site was declared excess and closed on 30 September 1968. Station today The main support station is now the Hutchinson Community College and Area Vocational School, which have torn down the former military buildings and replaced them with new buildings. Some former military family housing units appear to be in use as private residences. The Federal Aviation Administration took over operation and maintenance of the former Air Force radars. which are still in use. (N 37 55' 23\\" W 97 53' 15\\").

Some commentators, including sociobiologists, criticized the book and rejected its conclusions. Summary Brownmiller criticizes authors such as Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels for what she considers their oversights on the subject of rape. She describes rape as \\"a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear\\". She writes that, to her knowledge, no zoologist has ever observed that animals rape in their natural habitat.Brownmiller, Susan (1975). Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape, Simon & Schuster. Pelican Books edition, 1986: pp. 11, 12, 15. Brownmiller sought to examine general belief systems that women who were raped deserved it, as discussed by Clinton Duffy and others. She discusses rape in war, challenges the Freudian concept of women's rape fantasies, and compares it to the gang lynchings of African Americans by white men. This comparison was used to show how lynching was once considered acceptable by communities, and then attitudes changed, followed by changed laws; Brownmiller hoped the same would happen with rape. Reception Against Our Will is widely credited with changing public outlooks and attitudes about rape. It is cited as having influenced changes in law regarding rape, such as state criminal codes that required a corroborating witness to a rape, and that permitted a defendant's lawyer to introduce evidence in court regarding a victim's prior sexual history. Mary Ellen Gale wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Against Our Will \\"deserves a place on the shelf next to those rare books about social problems which force us to make connections we have too long evaded, and change the way we feel about what we know.\\" It was included in the \\"Women Rise\\" category of the New York Public Library's Books of the Century. The critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt gave the book a mostly positive review in The New York Times, noting that Brownmiller \\"organized an enormous body of information into a multipurposed tool\\" that gave a program for modernizing rape laws while considering the treatment of rape in war overly detailed and numbing. Others have taken a more critical view of the work. Gay scholar John Lauritsen dismissed Against Our Will, calling it \\"a shoddy piece of work from start to finish: ludicrously inaccurate, reactionary, dishonest, and vulgarly written.\\" Essay initially published in shorter form in The Gay Liberator (Detroit) in 1976 and complete in mimeographed pamphlet that year. Posted online 2001. Angela Davis argued that Brownmiller disregarded the part that black women played in the anti-lynching movement and that Brownmiller's discussion of rape and race became an \\"unthinking partnership which borders on racism\\". Brownmiller's conclusions about rapists' motivations have been criticized by the anthropologist Donald Symons in The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1979), and by Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer in A Natural History of Rape (2000). The historian Peter Gay wrote that Against Our Will \\"deserves pride of place among (rightly) indignant\\" feminist discussions of rape, but that Brownmiller's treatment of Sigmund Freud is unfair. The critic Camille Paglia called Against Our Will well-meaning, but nevertheless dismissed it as an example of \\"the limitations of white middle-class assumptions in understanding extreme emotional states or acts.\\" The behavioral ecologist John Alcock writes that while Brownmiller claimed that no zoologist had ever observed animals raping in their natural habitat, there was already \\"ample evidence\\" of forced copulations among animals in 1975, and that further evidence has accumulated since then.

History The first functions of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry began in 1855 when a sheep scab inspector began work in the New South Wales colony of Moreton Bay. After Queensland's Separation, livestock diseases were addressed through regulations administered by the Stock Branch in the Queensland Colonial Secretary's Office. The Stock Branch was established by the Queensland chief inspector of stock Patrick Robertson Gordon. Biosecurity The Biosecurity Queensland section is responsible for coordinating efforts to minimise the risks and effects of threatening pests and diseases. Biosecurity Queensland is responsible for weed management in the state. In 2009, Biosecurity Queensland was successful in its attempt to eradicate a citrus canker outbreak in Central Queensland. The Tree of Knowledge was successfully cloned in 2008 by workers at the former Department of Primary Industries. The overarching federal legislation, Biosecurity Act 2015, the state's Biosecurity Act 2014, and the Queensland Biosecurity Strategy 2018-2023 govern and guide the Department's responsibilities with regard to biosecurity. Research In 2009, Primary Industries and Fisheries (now Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) together with the University of Queensland were granted federal funding to study how methane emissions from cattle and sheep could be reduced. Publications From 1897 to 1921 the department published the Queensland Agricultural Journal.

With over 13 billion all-time video views and 22 million subscribers (making it the 27th-most viewed channel), WatchMojo has one of the largest channels on YouTube. Sixty percent of its viewers and subscribers are male, and 92% are from the United States. Including its international editions like WatchMojo Español and vertical channels like MsMojo, it has over 36 million subscribers. Its global reach when measured by unique monthly viewers has grown from 97 million in March 2018 to 115 million by September 2018 and 150 million by January 2019. Throughout the first three months of 2019, its reach grew to 250 million unique viewers across YouTube, Snap, Facebook and other platforms. As of April 2020, WatchMojo's YouTube channels generated over 100 Billion minutes of watch time.  History  According to the company's biography, The 10-Year Overnight Success: An Entrepreneurship's Manifesto – How WatchMojo Built the Most Successful Media Brand, WatchMojo's vision is to \\"inform and entertain,\\" with a mission to produce \\"a video on every topic.\\" After spending the first half of the 2000s writing hundreds of columns on entertainment, lifestyle and history and publishing two books, company founder Ashkan Karbasfrooshan created WatchMojo to produce videos that were of higher quality than the user-generated fare found on most websites, but in a format, style, length and tone that catered to Internet viewers' tastes. As such, WatchMojo.com was founded in January 2006 by Ashkan Karbasfrooshan, Raphael Daigneault, and Christine Voulieris. Other early key employees include Kevin Havill and Derek Allen. The WatchMojo.com website was launched on January 23, 2006 and its YouTube channel was launched on January 25, 2007. Alex Lefebvre, a former colleague of Karbasfrooshan's, joined in 2008 as CTO and head of design after spending a decade at AskMen and IGN. Originally the content featured hosts and vlog-style presentations, but over the years the programming shifted to more polished visuals featuring voice-overs. WatchMojo is an independent channel; it is neither a Multi-Channel Network (MCN) nor part of one. According to the CEO Karbasfrooshan, WatchMojo employed 23 full- time employees and a team of 100-plus freelance writers and video editors by October 2014. By March 2017, that number jumped to 50-plus. The videos it produces are typically submitted and voted on by visitors on its suggestion tool, as well as ideas suggested on its YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter pages. As the activity on its YouTube channel comments' section grew, WatchMojo designed and built the suggest tool to centralize voter submissions. The suggest tool has garnered 10 million votes across the 2.5 million list entries on 500,000 video ideas suggested by the 250,000 users who have signed up for the feature. On its main YouTube channel, it hit 1 million subscribers on October 30, 2013 and then 5 million subscribers on August 29, 2014. In December 2014, on the day its YouTube channel surpassed 6 million subscribers, it announced a representation deal with talent agency William Morris Endeavor. It surpassed 10 million subscribers on December 5, 2015. The 15 millionth subscriber was registered on July 29, 2017. Across the company's other channels (JrMojo, MsMojo, and the non-English international editions), the WatchMojo Network boasts over 30 million subscribers. During the 2016–17 regular season of the NHL, WatchMojo sponsored the NY Islanders. In October 2016, Karbasfrooshan published The 10-Year Overnight Success: An Entrepreneurship's Manifesto – How WatchMojo Built the Most Successful Media Brand on YouTube on the company's new publishing imprint, as it ventured into digital books and guides. In August 2017, WatchMojo was accused of plagiarism in a video. WatchMojo explained that the company relies on its suggest tool as inspiration for many of its videos, and uses a large base of freelance writers, conceding that the company needs to relentlessly educate its writers regarding proper crediting to avoid accusations of plagiarism. In autumn 2017, the company unveiled a handful of channels in mainland China in partnership with Weibo. The company's advisory board includes former AOL executive and NatGeo president Ted Prince as well as former DMG Entertainment exec Chris Fenton.  Content  The company averages over 5 minutes of watch time per video, far above industry standard. It does not feature user-generated content nor does it allow a mechanism for users to upload videos onto its site. The website produces daily \\"Top Ten\\" videos as well as videos summarizing the history of specific niche topics. These topics can be one of 16 categories: Anime, automotive, business, comedy, education, fashion, film, health and fitness, lifestyle, music, parenting, politics and economy, space and science, sports, technology, travel, and video games. Each day it publishes over five videos for 60–75 minutes of original content. In February 2016, it launched the MsMojo channel to better serve female viewers and fans. It also launched multiple non-English channels for the Spanish, French, German, Italian, Turkish, Polish and Hungarian markets. In April 2017, it launched the JrMojo channel for toddlers and kids. On April 15, 2017, WatchMojo debuted The Lineup, a game show that combined ranking top 10 lists with elements of a fantasy draft and sports talk radio banter. It won a Telly Award for Best Series in the Web Series category. On May 31, 2017, WatchMojo live-streamed its first live show, called WatchMojo Live at YouTube Space at Chelsea Market. The show consisted of an afternoon industry track covering online media, advertising, and VR. It was then followed by an evening show featuring DJ Killa Jewel, DJ Dan Deacon, Puddles Pity Party and Caveman. In June 2017, it launched WatchMojo UK, a channel that focuses on pop culture, entertainment, music, TV, movies and sports based in and around the United Kingdom. On July 12, 2017, it followed up with WatchMojo Live at YouTube Space in London at King's Cross Station, featuring musical acts by Llew Eyre, Bluey Robinson and Leif Erikson. Speakers at the industry track included Hussain Manawer, Ben Jones and Kim Snow. In addition to video programming, it has ventured into digital books and guides. Titles under the WatchMojo Publishing unit include Top 10 Anime of All Time, 50 Most Influential Sci-Fi Shows on TV, Read-Only: A Collection of Digital Horror, 75 Most Influential Horror Films of All Time, 50 Most Influential Comics of the 1980s, Top 100 Music Videos of the 2000s, 100 Decade-Defining Movie Movements of the 1990s, as well as its 10-year Special Edition Magazine and 10-Year Overnight Success book covering the company's history and rise of YouTube as a dominant video platform. In December 2017, it launched The WORST Travel Show on Facebook Watch, a semi-scripted travel comedy series chronicling establishments which have been maligned in online reviews. In January 2018, it launched MojoPlays, a channel based around video games, and by April 2018 it recruited former IGN host Naomi Kyle as host. It subsequently launched the MojoTalks channel to cover pop culture, entertainment and media news as it continued to expand into other formats than its top 10 lists, including talk and trivia formats. It expanded into the Science category through the March 2018 acquisition of Unveiled. By 2019, it expanded on its trivia offerings by launching a trivia app. In March 2019, WatchMojo deleted a lot of other Top 10 and Top 5 on YouTube videos Due to the Based on Community Guideliness. In April 2019, With an extensive library of videos that rely on fair use - released a video that relied on its 10-year experiences managing claims and strikes via Content ID to highlight instances of alleged abuse. In a follow-up video, the channel estimated that rights holders had unlawfully claimed over $2 billion from 2014-19. (See also Content ID) In an appearance on Bloomberg BNN in February 2019 with host Jon Ehrlichman, Karbasfrooshan announced the launch of a new brand focused on business with an emphasis on entrepreneurship called Context (Eventually ContextTV). The company published its first documentary called Fox in the Henhouse on the ContextTV channel. The documentary explored the role of entrepreneurship to bridge the wealth gap at a time when young voters are drawn to socialism and billionaire capitalists are ringing alarm bells about income inequality It live-streamed the Saturn Awards on September 13, 2019. Three-years after launching the award-winning gameshow The Lineup, it released What the List?  Business model  WatchMojo.com lost money the first six years of operations, broke even in 2012, and has generated a profit since 2013. Due to the 2007–2009 recession, WatchMojo.com had de-emphasized an ad- supported model in favour of licensing fees paid by other media companies to access and use their media. Later that year Beet.TV featured WatchMojo.com alongside Magnify.net as examples of companies which successfully switched from ad-based revenue models to licensing fee based revenue models. In 2012, it shifted its focus to YouTube and as a result of its growth in subscribers and views, it became profitable. In addition, WatchMojo licenses its content to Verizon's Aol and Go90 platforms, DailyMotion, Facebook and others. Many academic institutions and educational publishers use the company's programming in ESL programs as well as K-12 curriculum. WatchMojo encourages educators and students to use videos in its catalogue that are pertinent and complementary to their studies as part of presentations. In 2016, Ernst & Young awarded Karbasfrooshan with the Entrepreneur of the Year in the Media & Entertainment category, for the Quebec region, following in the footsteps of Cirque du Soleil's Guy Laliberte, who won it previously. In March 2018, it acquired the Unveiled channel as its first acquisition. In September 2019, it invested in the Buffer festival which showcases digital creators. WatchMojo is represented by Los Angeles-based ICM Partners.

He played for the Western Suburbs Magpies and a NRL touch judge. Club career A Canterbury junior with St George Dragons, Bass Hill RSL, then Chester Hill Hornets from the age of 11, Fallah played thirds and reserve grade with the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs while still in high school. After finishing high school, he studied at the University of Wollongong and played three seasons with the Corrimal Cougars and represented the Illawarra divisional team and NSW Country. He then captain-coached the Oberon Tigers for two seasons, also representing Group 10, Western Division and again NSW Country. Fallah came to attention representing Illawarra in the country rugby league championship 1981. He went on to represent Country Firsts later that year. Fallah joined the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1984, but badly injured his knee in his second game in reserves. He made his first grade debut towards the end of the season, playing in 6 games, but broke his arm in the second last match. From 1985-1990, he was the regular starting hooker for the club. He scored his first try in round 2 of 1985 against Manly, and scored a double in round 23 against Souths. He scored 14 tries for Wests. The mid-to-late eighties were an unsuccessful period for the Magpies, but Fallah often gained attention for his performances. He was described as, \\"one of the best number 12s in the game.\\" Coach Ken Gentle said of him, \\"You can have your Benny Elias. I wouldn't swap Allan for any other hooker in Sydney.\\" Fallah was later named as hooker in the Magpies' Team of the Eighties. Refereeing After his retirement as a player, Fallah became a NRL referee/touch judge. He officiated in 87 NRL games, 3 State of Origins and two internationals. He was involved in two incidents that gained press attention. In the first, where Fallah was a touch judge, coach Chris Anderson described referee Rod Lawrence's performance as, \\"fucking disgraceful,\\" when he encountered the officials at half-time of a match. In the second, there was confusion over whether a conversion should have been awarded when one touch judge raised a flag and another did not. Retirement Fallah remained involved in rugby league after his retirement. He coached at the Gymea Technology High School where he taught and represented NSW and Australia in Oztag at an over-45s level, alongside former teammate Trevor Cogger. Current Allan Fallah currently teaches physical education at Gymea Technology High School in Sydney, New South Wales.

Work In 1989, Eigler was the first to use a scanning tunneling microscope tip to arrange individual atoms on a surface, famously spelling out the letters \\"IBM\\" with 35 xenon atoms. He later went on to create the first quantum corrals, which are well-defined quantum wave patterns of small numbers of atoms, and nanoscale logic circuits using individual molecules of carbon monoxide. He shared the 2010 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience with Nadrian Seeman for these breakthroughs. Eigler's 1989 research, along with Erhard K. Schweizer, involved a new use of the scanning tunneling microscope, which had been invented in the mid 1980s by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, also of IBM. The microscope had previously been used for atomic-resolution imaging, but this was the first time it had been used as an active technique, to precisely position individual atoms on a surface. The technique requires vacuum conditions and ultra-cold temperatures achieved by liquid helium cooling, and was featured on the cover of the journal Nature. At the time, it was seen as a potential first step towards applications in mechanosynthesis, where chemical reactions could be manipulated one molecule at a time. Eigler's 2002 research, along with Andreas J. Heinrich, used a cascade of collisions of carbon monoxide molecules to perform logic operations. Eigler graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a doctoral degree in 1984. He was postdoctoral staff at AT&T; Bell Labs for two years, and then moved to IBM where he was appointed IBM Fellow in 1993.

Rider Haggard, published in 1923, by Hutchinson & Co in the UK and Doubleday, Page and Company in the US. It is the final published book in the Ayesha series but chronologically the first book in the series. Along with the other three novels in the series, Wisdom's Daughter was adapted into the 1935 film She. Overview At the end of She: A History of Adventure, the title character appeared to be killed; but promised to return. In Ayesha, the second book, the two adventurers from the first novel, Leo and Holly, are inspired to look for She in Thibet. They discover people who have lived in a hidden mountain since the time of Alexander the Great. They find Ayesha leading the cult of Hes, though they do not recognise her at first. After which, they plan to return to The Flame of Life, in Kor, Africa; but first they have to wait for the paths to clear in the spring. Talking to Leo and Holly reminds Ayesha of the past; including the time she met Allan Quatermain, recounted in She and Allan, the third book in the series. While they are waiting, She takes the time to write out her memories and plans to rule the world, through her alchemy, and return the Ancient Egyptian cult of Isis to prominence and power. The narrative breaks off abruptly, and returns to the conclusion of the story in Ayesha. The novel includes several historical figures of the 4th century BC as characters, including the Pharaohs Nectanebo I and Nectanebo II, Emperor Artaxerxes III, King Tennes of Sidon, Greek mercenary Mentor of Rhodes, and the Persian eunuch Bagoas. It is also implied that Ayesha was the model for the Aphrodite of Knidos. Ayesha (Book Cover), from original 1905 artwork. Frame story As in the other books in the series, there is a frame story, which links the fantasy elements to their publication in the real world. In this case, after Holly's death, the Executor of his will decides to publish this manuscript as the fourth and final book in the series, instead of destroying it as Holly had instructed. Although, the manuscript has been partially burned, most of it is intact. The Executor doesn’t think of it as more than a work of imagination. However, before Holly's death, he was holding the Sistrum of Isis, and he was visited by a spirit of some kind, which the Executor thinks might have been She. She is so beautiful Holly can only bear to look at her veiled, from the Graphic (1886) Plot As Holly points out, the story is told from She's perspective, and since She claims to have lived for over two thousand years, since Ancient Egypt, there is no way to compare her story with any other sources, or witnesses. She Who Must Be Obeyed says that she was Arabian, by birth; and given the name Ayesha. Although, in the introduction, Sir H. Rider Haggard links the name Ayesha to Mohammed's wives, and Arabic or Arabic names, (Arabic: عائشة, Āʾisha), stating that it should be pronounced \\"Ash/ -ha\\";https://archive.org/stream/ayeshareturnshe01hagggoog#page/n14/mode/2up A·ye·sha/ äˈ(y)ēSHə/, is perhaps more common. She claims that her natural beauty and wisdom was so great, it caused wars between the princes, who wanted to marry her. She says that while this was at first a great source of pride among her Father’s people, they soon began to resent her, and spread vicious rumours that she was cursed. Ayesha leads her Father’s people into victory, and revels in the battle; but, the women envy her, and the men lust after her. So, she decides to go into hiding, with her tutor, an Egyptian priest; rather than be turned over to the approaching armies of Pharaoh. She tells about travelling through the ancient world, encountering all the major artists, who want her to model for them; as well as philosophers, and religions of the time, from Ancient Greece and fledgling Ancient Rome to Palestine and Jerusalem. A statue of a priestess of Isis, Roman, 2nd century, BCE Finally, they return to Egypt, where once again, her beauty and wisdom become a source of contention. She swears an oath of celibacy, to serve Isis the Goddess of the Spirit of Nature, and turn away from Aphrodite the Goddess of Love. But, soon a Greek soldier of fortune, Kallikrates, formerly employed by the Pharaoh, comes to her for sanctuary. He takes an oath to serve Isis; but the Pharaoh's daughter pursues him; and, seeing the way Ayesha looks at him, she determines to destroy her, as a rival. The Princess mocks Ayesha's prophecies as mere parlor tricks. She goads her Father into giving Ayesha away, as a sex slave, to one of his allies. Repeatedly, Ayesha is in danger; but, even in the midst of fire and battle, Isis and her followers save her from ruin and rape. Ayesha's fame grows so great, that she is called \\"Isis Come To Earth\\" and “Wisdom's Daughter”. Finally, the King of Kings, of the Persian Empire, comes to see her. He laughs that anyone would be afraid of what must be an old hag, as Isis's Priestess. He spits on Isis's statues, and burns the old gods. However, again her beauty, which the King glimpses beneath her veil; betrays her; and, he determines to rape her, with the rest of the country. A temple wall painting of the Goddess Isis, circa 1360 BCE Isis saves her; and, they escape, to reunite with her old Captain, Kallikrates, and the Princess. Ayesha is inspired that Isis wants to rebuild her cult and usher in a new Golden Age, in the world, through herself. She is led to the hidden kingdom of Kor, in Africa, to begin. Once there, Ayesha meets her former tutor, who has been guarding The Flame of Eternal Life, which will make a person young and powerful, for as long as the world endures. He passes this one last mystery onto Ayesha, warning her of its temptation to her vanity. The Princess mocks Ayesha's fading youth; and feeling ashamed, in front of Kallikrates, Ayesha determines to break her oaths, and make herself and him both immortal, to rule the world, like Gods, by stepping into The Flame. This way she feels she will be as \\"Isis Come To Earth\\", indeed. But, \\"Wisdom's Daughter\\" is Fortune's Fool, and falls by Love's Folly. Kallikrates is afraid when he sees Ayesha, in her preternatural beauty, after she has bathed in The Flame; and, dies. The others either flee in terror or are killed, overwhelmed by her beauty. Aphrodite laughs at her, and Isis. Now, Ayesha cannot die, or she will be opposed. She is as terrible, beautiful, and deadly as lightning. After Kallikrates' death, the Princess flees, urging her descendants to revenge themselves on She, through the artifacts she passes down, which Holly and Leo find, in the first book, She: A History of Adventure. Sir H. Rider Haggard's recreation of the Sherd of Amenartas, now in the collection of the Norwich Castle Museum, in which the Egyptian Princess urges Leo's descendants to revenge themselves on She. Ayesha is doomed to wait, in Kor, for his return, through the centuries, becoming weary of the world. She has learned everything the world and Nature has to offer; but, still she must wait, for love and redemption.

She has been nicknamed the \\"energetic old lady\\" () for her on-stage persona. Biography Sari was born Nurlaila Sari Jahrotuljannah in Padang Panjang, West Sumatra, on 4 November 1935. Her father died when she was two, and the following year her grandparents took her from her singer mother Amak to live on Java. There, she was raised in a devout Muslim environment. She went back to live her mother and new stepfather at the age of nine, then — after a period disapproving of her mother's singing career for religious reasons and studying ballet — began singing as an easy way to earn money. She made her debut by singing at a wedding party in Pontianak, West Kalimantan with her parents. Sari continued to perform in concerts, although she did not release any albums during her career. She performed for soldiers and President Sukarno often invited her to perform during Independence Day celebrations at the Presidential Palace. As she became more famous throughout the archipelago, she found herself increasingly sought after by men seeking romance; in a 2010 interview with The Jakarta Globe, Sari recalled that at times they fought over her. In 1955 she appeared in her first film. Three years later, she was banned from performing in Bekasi and Karawang (both in West Java) when committees of women feared she would steal their husbands. In 1960, Sari married a Dutchman named Boertje (Indonesian: Murdadi Iskandar), who was five years her junior. As Sari was infertile, the two adopted a child. Sari continued to act, including playing Slamet Rahardjo's love interest in Teguh Karya's 1971 film Wadjah Seorang Laki-Laki (The Face of a Boy). In 1993, Boertje had a stroke and Sari cut back on her singing and acting to tend to him and her ailing mother; to fund the medical treatment, she sold her cars and second house in Cengkareng, West Jakarta. Bertje died in 2000, a week after Sari's mother. After several offers to go on the Hajj —- the pilgrimage to Mecca mandatory to able-bodied Muslims — she eventually accepted an offer by actress Desy Ratnasari and her family, who were going that year; Ratnasari covered all expenses incurred during the trip, while Sari managed to do some commercials to have extra money for her family. Since then, Sari played comedic roles on television; she also spends time entertaining the elderly at nursing homes. In May 2005 she won a lifetime achievement award from the Inspiring Women Awards in Jakarta. She lived with her family, including her great granddaughter, in Tangkiwood, West Jakarta; they lived in poverty. Laila Sari died on 20 November 2017 from undisclosed causes, aged 82.  Style  Since her debut, Sari has worn mainly modest clothing. While singing, she used exaggerated movements and wore a kain (similar to a sarong), long sleeved shirt, and headscarf. While performing on variety shows, she preferred brightly coloured wigs and children's dress.  Filmography  During her career, Sari has performed in more than 20 films. * Dinamika (Dynamics; 1955) * Peristiwa 10 November (10 November Incident; 1956) * Singa Betina dari Marunda (The Lioness from Marunda; 1971) * Wadjah Seorang Laki-Laki (The Face of a Boy; 1971) * Warung Pojok (Corner Store; 1977) * Pulau Putri (Woman Island; 1977) * Inem Nyonya Besar (Inem the Big Mistress; 1977) * Tuan Besar (Big Man; 1977) * Sinyo Adi (1977) * Kembang Semusim (A Season's Flower; 1980) * Juara Cilik (Young Champion; 1980) * Ketika Cinta Harus Memilih (When Love Must Choose; 1981) * Halimun (1982) * Ke Ujung Dunia (To the Ends of the Earth; 1983) * Tante Garang (Fierce Aunt; 1983) * Kelainan Cinta (Forgetful in Love; 1983) * Perempuan Kedua (Second Woman; 1990) * Lupus IV (1990) * Amrin Membolos (Amrin Plays Hooky; 1996) * Anda Puas, Saya Loyo (You're Satisfied, I'm Exhausted; 2008) * Cinlok (Love on Location; 2008) * Anak Ajaib (Magic Child; 2008) * Hantu Tanah Kusir (Ghost of Tanah Kusir; 2010)  Notes   References  Footnotes Bibliography  * * Category:1935 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from West Sumatra Category:Indonesian female singers Category:Indonesian rock singers Category:Indonesian comedians Category:Indonesian Muslims Category:Muslim female comedians ","title":"Laila Sari"},{"id":"34607631","text":"KOAZ may refer to: People *Eddy Koaz (born 1959), Israeli Olympic judoka Radio and tv stations * 1510 KOAZ Isleta, New Mexico (facility ID #65389) -- an AM station that formerly used the callsigns KABR and KMYN when it was on 1500 kHz * 48 KOAZ-LP O'Neill, Nebraska (facility ID #128007) -- a short-lived low-power TV station that relayed KFXL-TV and went off the air in 2011 * 97.5 KSZR Oro Valley, Arizona (facility ID #39734) -- an FM station that used the callsign KOAZ from 1998 to 2003 * 103.5 KLNZ Glendale, Arizona (facility ID #48738) -- an FM station that used the callsign KOAZ from 1996 to 1997, then KWCY before KLNZ ","title":"KOAZ (disambiguation)"},{"id":"34607634","text":"The Ninety Mile Beach Marine National Park is a protected marine national park in situated off the Gippsland coast in eastern Victoria, Australia.

To control costs, the ships will not be built to combat vessel standards and are designed primarily to support three military hovercraft (such as the Landing Craft Air Cushion), vehicle staging with a sideport ramp and large mooring fenders. A decision was made to eliminate helicopter capability and ship-to-ship transfer of heavy equipment. An auxiliary support ship, Montford Points role would be a seagoing pier for friendly forces in case accessibility to onshore bases are denied. Such flexibility would be useful following natural disasters and for supporting US Marines once they are ashore. The ESD supports a vehicle staging area, side port ramp, large mooring fenders, and up to three landing craft air cushioned vessel lanes. The ship's engines are of British design and construction.

A special filter is electronically activated by a switch in the endoscope leading to the use of ambient light of wavelengths of 415 nm (blue) and 540 nm (green). Because the peak light absorption of hemoglobin occurs at these wavelengths, blood vessels will appear very dark, allowing for their improved visibility and in the improved identification of other surface structures. In gastrointestinal endoscopy, narrow-band imaging has found use in the identification of Barrett's esophagus, in the identification of pit patterns to classify colorectal polyps and tumours, and in the identification of atypical dysplastic cells in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. Also, in cystoscopy, which is the examination of the urinary bladder with an endoscope, narrow-band imaging is useful in differentiating between benign and malignant cells.

When Stefan Potocki established Potok Złoty, he modified his coat of arms by changing the silver cross to gold - in this way, the Piława Potocki line evolved into two branches: silver and golden. He and his wife, Maria Mohylanka, founded a church and convent of St. Stefan in the town. Jakub Potocki and Stefan Potocki are both buried there. In 1676, the invading Turkish-Tartar army destroyed the local castle. After the first partition of Poland in 1772, the town was controlled by the Holy Roman Empire (until 1804), the Austrian Empire (until 1867), Austria-Hungary (until 1919), Poland (until 1939), and finally the USSR (until 1991). In 1984, Zolotyi Potik was granted the status of an urban-type settlement. During the German occupation, its Jewish inhabitants, comprising around one-third of the total population, were mostly expelled to Buchach and then transported to the Bełżec extermination camp or shot.

It is found in the intertidal zone of the western seaboard of the United States. It is a predator and is unusual among starfish in that it broods its eggs and young. Taxonomy Leptasterias hexactis forms part of a species complex. Over the years, various authorities have discussed the phylogenetic relationships of L. epichlora, L. aequalis and L. hexactis, all species of Leptasterias found in the north west Pacific Ocean. The authorities were Bush (1918), Fisher (1930), Chia (1966), Kwast (1990) and Stickle (1992). More recent morphological and behavioural studies have resulted, according to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) in the retention of a single species, L. hexactis, with the other two being considered synonyms. WoRMS now recognizes three subspecies, L. hexactis hexactis (Stimpson, 1862) L. hexactis occidentalis Djakonov, 1938 and L. hexactis vancouveri (Perrier, 1875). Description Leptasterias hexactis Leptasterias hexactis is a rather squat starfish growing to a diameter of about with 6 short, broad arms. These are about as long as the disc is wide. The colour of the aboral (upper) surface varies, usually being a plain or mottled dark grey, brown or olive green colour or occasionally brick red. It is densely clad with short, mushroom-shaped spines, interspersed among which are pedicellariae (small, two-jawed pincers). The central row of spines on each arm is distinctive. The oral (under) surface is a pale colour with parallel rows of tube feet with suckers extending along the arms.Leptasterias hexactis Race Rocks. Retrieved 2012-02-04.Leptasterias hexactis (Stimpson, 1862) Walla Walla University. Retrieved 2012-02-04. In California Leptasterias hexactis might be confused with Leptasterias pusilla but that species is smaller, is usually a pale grey-brown or reddish colour and has elongated, thinner arms and sharp spines. Distribution and habitat Leptasterias hexactis occurs in the intertidal zone of the north east Pacific Ocean with a range extending from the San Juan Islands in Washington to the Channel Islands of California. It favours exposed locations battered by surf and may be found at low tide under boulders and hiding among seaweed on the lower shore. Its tube feet are very adhesive and it clings securely to rocks. Biology and ecology Leptasterias hexactis is attacking snail Nucella lima. Leptasterias hexactis is a carnivore and is able to attack and capture surprisingly large prey items with high nutritional content. The diet includes sea cucumbers, snails, limpets, mussels, chitons and barnacles as well as carrion. Over much of its range it competes with the larger Pisaster ochraceus (ochre starfish) for food. Leptasterias hexactis is dioecious with individuals being either male or female. In Puget Sound, reproduction takes place between November and April. The eggs have yolks and between 50 and 1500 are laid, depending on the size of the female. They are fertilized by sperm that has been discharged into the water column by males. The female then holds the eggs with her tube feet in a mass near her mouth, arching her body up as she broods them. She is unable to eat at this time and clings to the rock as best she can with the remaining tube feet though it may be only the tips of the arms that are available to hold her in place. While the eggs are being brooded, she tends them and keeps them clean. They are lecithotrophic and consume the yolks of their eggs as they develop. After about 40 days the eggs begin to hatch into juveniles, miniature starfish with truncated limbs. These continued to be brooded by the mother for a few weeks before setting off independently on their own. If breeding has taken place in an aquarium, they can be seen crawling over the glass, and sometimes floating on the surface of the water as neuston. They will become mature in about 2 years.

After the area was converted into part of the then-Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (now the Cuyahoga Valley National Park), the National Park Service discovered that the property, part of one of the most-heavily used parks in the country, was also one of the most contaminated sites in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Region V. The dump subsequently became a Superfund cleanup site. History The Krejci family owned a parcel exceeding and opened a junkyard for burning trash and dumping scrap metal in 1940. At some point, the dump began accepting industrial and municipal waste, much of it toxic. This activity continued until 1980, when it closed, but the salvage business operated until 1985. The property was bisected by the 1972 construction of Interstate 271, which left on the north side, and on the south side. The Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area was created in 1974, and the National Park Service acquired the Krejci property in 1985, thinking they had an old junkyard. The Krejcis vacated the property, and the following year, a person collecting bottles on the site became ill. Park rangers would complain of headaches, rashes, and odors. The National Park Service requested a thorough analysis of the site's contents from the Environmental Protection Agency. It was closed to the public in 1986 after toxic chemicals were found at 14 separate locations on north of I-271 and south. Toxins Drums leaching chemicals Upon investigation and testing of the site between 1986 and 1987, many toxic substances were found at the site, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), arsenic, dioxin, heavy metals, and other carcinogens. Thousands of leaking drums were found on the property. These drums contained waste from industrial processes, including paint, ink, herbicides, pesticides, solvents, and industrial sludge. Companies responsible Ford Motor Co, General Motors, Federal Metal Co, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M), Chrysler, Kewanee Industries (a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation USA), and Waste Management of Ohio were found to be potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in contributing and transporting toxic waste to the Krejci dump. The PRPs had manufacturing facilities in the general vicinity of the Krejci site; Waste Management of Ohio, who had acquired all of the smaller, local refuse hauling companies, had been held ultimately responsible for transporting the wastes. All of these companies were sued in 1997 by the US government through CERCLA (Superfund) to recoup the cost of the cleanup, and all of the PRPs agreed to settle out of court with the exception of 3M, who went to trial and lost. Cost The cost of the entire project to the US government is $50 million. However, money recovered through the CERCLA lawsuits resulted in a $21 million judgment against the PRPs. The cleanup project, at a cost of $29 million, was paid for by Ford Motor Co. with help from General Motors. The lawsuits, combined with Ford and GM covering the cost of the cleanup accounted for the entire cost of the project. In 2001 a National Park Service attorney said that the cleanup was the most expensive in the National Parks system. Cleanup Cleanup of the site consisted of removal of the drums themselves, along with the rest of the dump's non-hazardous contents. At one point in the cleanup, thousands of multicolored flags covered the former dump's property, identifying multi- increment sub-sample locations. Since soil had been contaminated by chemicals leaking from drums, dirt had to be removed from depths ranging from to . In the first 12 months of cleanup alone, of contaminated soil had been trucked out of the site. Most of the non-hazardous soil went to two licensed landfills in Ohio, and the contaminated soil went to a licensed facility outside of Detroit. By August 2012, of contaminated material had been removed from the site. Outcome Remediated area of former Krejci Dump Because of the extensive contamination, and its on-going identification as the cleanup proceeded, the NPS has made numerous predictions about the end-date for cleanup and remediation of the areas. For example, in July 2011 it was predicted that the Krejci dump site would be in the final stages of revegetation in the spring of 2012. But it wasn't until August 2012 that the NPS declared \\"comprehensive post-excavation soil sampling effort establishes that remediation goals for the 46-acre former dump site have been met,\\" and, \\"The final steps necessary to restore the Site may now begin, including final grading; re-vegetation using native meadow grasses, forbs and shrubs; and restoration of 3 acres of wetland and wet meadow habitats.\\" The Ohio Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) also had a projected end- date of sometime in 2012. The ultimate goal of the NPS was to have the site appear as it originally would have, with native plants and wetlands covering the area. \\"Upon completion of the cleanup, the site will be restored to natural conditions consistent with surrounding Park habitat, and restrictions on public access will be removed.\\" The most recent update from the NPS is dated February 3, 2015: References External links * Photos of Krejci Dump, then and now * Krejci Dump Fact Sheet, National Park Service, 2005 Fhuds * Boston Heights Dump Site Still Contaminated * Summit County Toxic-Waste Dump In Park Needs More Cleanup Work * CERCLA (Superfund) website * Krejci Dump Site Cleanup and Restoration (National Park Service, 2012) Category:Landfills in the United States Category:Superfund sites in Ohio Category:Cuyahoga Valley National Park Category:1940 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Krejci Dump"},{"id":"34607835","text":"Steven Charles Gonzalez (born 1963) is an American lawyer and judge who has served as an Associate Justice of the Washington Supreme Court since January 1, 2012.

The setting jumps between modern and medieval France and follows two women (played by Vanessa Kirby and Jessica Brown Findlay) who are searching for the Holy Grail. Other cast members include Katie McGrath, Tom Felton, Sebastian Stan, Emun Elliott, Tony Curran, and John Hurt. Adrian Hodges adapted the novel for the series, which was directed by Christopher Smith. A German-South African co-production, the two-part series was filmed on location in the medieval town of Carcassonne in southwest France and Cape Town, South Africa. The executive producers were Tim Halkin, Liza Marshall, Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Rola Bauer, Jonas Bauer, and Hodges. The series aired in Canada, Korea, Poland and Portugal in autumn 2012, in Sweden in December 2012, the UK in March 2013, the U.S. in May 2014, and was set to air in Austria and Germany early 2013. The running time was originally announced, and is still stated on the official website, as being \\"four hours\\". However, the broadcast version only runs for three hours. Overview The series follows two women—medieval Alaïs Pelletier du Mas (Jessica Brown Findlay), who lives through the Crusades and Cathar massacres in medieval France, and modern-day Alice Tanner (Vanessa Kirby)—in their quest to find the Holy Grail. Alice, a volunteer at a French archaeological excavation, discovers the skeletal remains of two people in a cave, as well as a labyrinth-engraved ring, which attracts the attention of unscrupulous individuals. In 1209, newly married Alaïs is living in Carcassonne, a stronghold of Cathars who have been declared heretical by the Church. Alaïs and her father are protecting three sacred books that reveal the secret of the Holy Grail from the Crusaders. Plot =Episode 1= Alice Tanner is working at an excavation in France when she finds something. As she does, an earthquake is present. Upon hearing voices, seemingly whispering her name, she is drawn into a cave. She finds the remains of two skeletons. On one of the skeletons she finds a labyrinth- engraved ring which she takes. As she slips it on her finger, she is taken back as if she was drunk. She starts calling out as if someone is with her whispering until she is seemingly attacked in her abdomen, her shirt stained with blood. When she exits the cave, she is not in her own world. She walks along as people in white, the Cathars, are burning people alive. One woman notices her and holds out a brown journal of sorts. Before Alice can grasp it, the scene changes. It is now Alaïs Pelletier, who we now know was the woman holding the book out to Alice, lying in a bed with her husband beside her. She thinks she has left him asleep as she leaves but he is awake. =Episode 2= Cast and characters *Tom Felton as Viscount Trencavel *Vanessa Kirby as Alice Tanner *Jessica Brown Findlay as Alaïs Pelletier du Mas, Guilhem's wife and Oriane's younger half-sister. *Sebastian Stan as Will Franklyn, an author and Marie-Cecile's boyfriend. *Emun Elliott as Guilhem du Mas, Alaïs' husband and Oriane's lover. *Tony Curran as Guy d'Évreux *John Hurt as Audric Baillard *Katie McGrath as Oriane Congost, Alaïs' widowed older half-sister and Guilhem's lover. *John Lynch as Simon de Montfort *Bernhard Schir as Paul Authie *Matthew Beard as Sajhe *Claudia Gerini as Marie-Cecile de l'Oradore *Danny Keogh as Bertrand Pelletier, Alaïs and Oriane's father *Janet Suzman as Esclarmonde *Lena Dörrie as Rixende *Isabella-Rose Tsinonis as Bertrande, Alais' daughter.
