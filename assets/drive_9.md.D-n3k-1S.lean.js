Clausena anisata (Willd.) Hook.f. ex Benth. is a deciduous shrub or small tree, belonging to the Rutaceae or Citrus family, and widespread in the Afrotropical realm or Sub- Saharan Africa, but absent from the drier regions. It is also found in tropical and South-East Asia, growing in India and Sri Lanka and extending as far as Queensland in north-eastern Australia and some Pacific islands. It is cultivated in Malaysia and Indonesia. As with other plants useful to mankind its large range of medicinal properties has led to a global distribution and its growth wherever the climate is suitable. It grows in higher-rainfall regions in savanna, thickets, riverine forest, disturbed areas and secondary forest, up to an altitude of 3000 m. The leaves, which are foetid when bruised, give rise to the common name 'Horsewood' or the more descriptive Afrikaans common name 'Perdepis', meaning 'horse urine'. This species is one of 25 in the genus Clausena, first described in 1768 by the Dutch botanist Nicolaas Laurens Burman, and named for the Norwegian clergyman, Peder Clauss√∏n Friis (1545-1614), the translator of the Icelandic historian and poet, Snorri Sturluson. Description Up to 10 m tall, this species has smooth, thin, grey-green bark becoming brownish and mottled with age. Young parts are puberulous. The compound leaves are up to 30 cm long and stipules are absent. Leaflets are 11‚Äì37 in number, alternate to sub-opposite, and ovate to narrowly elliptical in shape, with a markedly asymmetric, rounded or cuneate base. The leaflet apex is obtuse or notched, and the margins are entire or crenulate. The leaf surfaces are densely covered with embedded, pellucid glands, which are strongly aromatic when bruised. The inflorescence is a hairy, lax axillary panicle. The scented flowers are bisexual, regular, and 4-merous. Sepals are about 1 mm long, while the elliptical petals are 3‚Äì7 mm long, concave, and cream to yellowish-white in colour. The 8 stamens have filaments 2‚Äì6 mm long, which are thickened at their base. Fruit an ovoid, fleshy berry, 3.3‚Äì7 mm in diameter, single-seeded and turning red or purplish-black when mature. Timber is yellowish-white, elastic and dense (0.8 g/cm3). Phytochemicals As with other species of the family Rutaceae, the leaves, fruits and stem bark are rich in aromatic essential oils. Carbazole alkaloids are the major constituents of plants in this family, with coumarins and phenylpropanoids which are named clausamines.http://www.mmh- mms.com/downloads/mp09clausenaanisata.pdf Analysis shows the presence of estragole, (E)-anethole, methyl chavicol, (E)-foeniculin, Œ≤-pinene, sabinene, (Z)-Œ≤-ocimene, germacrene B, (E)-Œ≤-ocimene and terpinen-4-ol, (Z)-tagetenone, (E)-tagetenone, (E)-nerolidol, germacrene D, methyl chavicol, myrcene, limonene, Œ≤-caryophyllene, 3-carene, Œ≤-humulene, coumarins of the furanocoumarin type - imperatorin, isoimperatorin, oxypeucedanine, bergaptene, xanthotoxin, xanthotoxol and chalepin, geranylcoumarin (anisocoumarin A‚ÄìI), furanocoumarin-lactone type (indicolactone, anisolactone), the tetranortriterpenoids limonin, zapoterin, clausenolide, carbazole alkaloids furanoclausamine A and B, clausamine B, C, D and E, mukonal, glycosinine, mukonidine and clausine F, the pyranocarbazole alkaloid mupamine. Five major essential oils from the leaf - Œ≤-pinene, sabinene, germacrene-D, estragole and linalool - are efficacious control agents of the larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. They are also effective insecticides and deterrents when used in stored foods. Tenebrio molitor, Rhyzopertha dominica, Sitophilus zeamais and other species suffer almost complete mortality. The oils also block the reproduction of Tribolium castaneum when used as a fumigant, or added to wheat flour at a concentration of 0.2% by weight. These essential oils are generally considered harmless to human beings and are routinely used in flavouring, perfumes, confectionery and pharmaceuticals. An extract of the twigs shows activity against Plasmodium falciparum. The oils also affect Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Flavobacterium suaveolens, Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and Serratia marcescens. Clausenol is active against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, such as Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus parasiticus, Geotrichum candidum, Phytophthora palmivora and Penicillium citrinum. Leaf extracts strongly affect the fungi causing oral candidiasis and skin infections - Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Cryptococcus neoformans. A methanolic extract from the roots shows molluscicidal results in Bulinus globosus, the intermediate host in schistosomiasis. The coumarins heliettin and imperatorin are toxic to snails - imperatorin also shows anticonvulsant activity. Essential oils from the leaves also show moderate antioxidant activity in vitro, while root extracts show hypoglycaemic activity. Chalepin exhibits anticoagulant activity and when administered intraperitoneally causes the death of 40% of treated rats within 48 hours. Clausamines D‚ÄìG inhibit early antigen activation of the Epstein-Barr virus. Leaf extracts have a mild effect on HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains, and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Clausamine E is cytotoxic to the human leukemia cell line HL60. Dose-dependent inhibition of migration of Ascaris suum third-stage larvae after exposure to extracts of three different medicinal plants; Clausena anisata in red In 2016, a study by Williams, Soelberg and J√§ger showed than ethanolic extracts of Clausena anisata have in vitro anthelmintic properties against the nematode Ascaris suum, a swine parasite that is closely related to the human parasite A. lumbricoides. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value was 74 Œºg/mL. The authors concluded that these results encourage further investigation of the use of this plant as complementary treatment options for ascariasis. Medicinal uses This species is used in treating an uncommonly wide range of ailments and conditions. Decoctions of the leaves or roots are taken for gastro-intestinal disorders, fever, pneumonia, headache, hypotension, sore throat and sinusitis, venereal diseases, as an aphrodisiac and anthelmintic, as a tonic for pregnant women, and as a tonic for infants to prevent rickets and to control convulsions. Root decoctions and infusions are also taken for whooping cough, malaria, syphilis and kidney ailments, irregular menses, threatening abortion, skin diseases and epilepsy, and given to women before and after parturition to ease delivery and to expel blood from the uterus, and later to boost milk production. Roots are chewed to combat indigestion. Crushed leaves are used as an antiseptic and analgesic, and are applied to open wounds, mouth infections, otitis and abscesses, also burns, haemorrhoids, rheumatism and general body pains. Crushed leaves are also used to treat wounds in domestic animals, and as a snake-bite antidote. Dried leaves are widely used as an arthropod repellent, such as a filling material for mattresses and pillows against fleas, lice and bedbugs. The fruits are sweet and readily eaten by people and other animals. Stem bark is pounded and used as rope.

The NBP church in Weesp, the Netherlands  Structure  Easter service in the NPB church in Driebergen, the Netherlands.

Handboek christelijk Nederland: kerken, gemeenten, samenkomsten en vergaderingen. Kok 2008, p. 305  History  The Dutch Protestant Association NBP was established in 1870 by Cornelis Willem Opzoomer, Cornelis Tiele and others. It came as a reaction of liberal Protestants to the Confessionele vereniging (English: The Confessional Association) created in 1864 and Orthodox Protestantism. From the NBP came the Centrale Commissie voor het Vrijzinnig Protestantisme (English: Central Committee for Liberal Protestantism) that established the VPRO (1926) and was involved in the Leidse Bijbelvertaling (English: The Leiden Translation of the Bible) that was used by Dutch liberal Protestants for decades to follow (1914).  Profile and ideas  There can be significant differences between local communities constituting the association. Some are based upon religious humanism, some upon Christian Universalism and some upon liberal Christianity. All liberal- minded people may become members of the association regardless of membership in other Christian denominations, whether they are baptized or not or adhere to a certain creed. In liberal Protestantism the Bible is not seen as the Word of God in a literal sense, but rather as a document - a collection of meaningful stories - witnessing to the love of God. It is also striven to connect faith with the insights of modern science and with rationality.

Probably built in the late 18th century, this Federal period house is distinctive for its association with the now-suburban area's agrarian past, and as a two-family residence of the period, with two \\"Beverly jogs\\". The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Oliver House is located at the northwest corner of Oak Street and Crosby Road in the Greenwood section of southern Wakefield. It is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a side-gable roof and clapboard siding. The entrance, at the center of the south-facing facade, is flanked by fluted pilasters, and is topped by a transom window and projecting lintel. The rear of the house has several additions built under a roof that slopes down to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox profile. The outer additions extend beyond the sides of the main block, a local example of a \\"Beverly jog\\". These additions each added a kitchen to the building. The interior of the house has well-preserved Federal period woodwork. Long thought to have been built in the mid-18th century, stylistic analysis suggests that it was more likely built in the late 18th century. It is built on land that was first settled in the 17th century by the Smith family. In the late 18th century, the property went through a rapid succession of owners, and it may be that this house was built by William Williams, not long after his marriage and purchase of the property in 1797. Williams died in 1813, leaving his wife and eight minor children. It is thought that additions to make multi-family living in the house possible date to after that time. The house was sold in 1814 to Ezekiel Oliver in 1814, the widow retaining a share of the house. The house would be used by multiple families, or extended families, or families with boarders, for more than 150 years.

She served as a lawmaker in the Federal Parliament of Somalia. A prominent figure in traditional Somali music, her art and legislative work were centered on political and social justice. She was killed by Islamists in Mogadishu Personal life Warsame was born in 1950 in Buuhoodle, situated in the northern Cayn region of Somalia. She came from a nomadic family from the Dhulbahante sub-clan of the Harti Darod. After the start of the civil war in Somalia in the early 1990s, Warsame moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. She later resided for a while in St. Cloud. In 2012, Warsame returned to Somalia to serve in the newly established Federal Government based in Mogadishu. Career =Music= Saado Ali Warsame performing at a Somali community event organized in her honour (2011). Warsame was a prominent figure in traditional Somali music. Her art was noted for its emphasis on political and social justice, as well as nationalism and romantic love. She often made use of satire, metaphor and historical allusions to convey complex themes in an understandable manner. Warsame's song \\"Laand Karuusar\\" criticized kleptocracy in the ruling military junta. She also blamed incompetent management for infrastructural dilapidation of Mogadishu's then two five-star hotels, establishments which had originally been built with public funds. Additionally, Warsame was one of several prominent Somali artists that took part in the long-running \\"Deelley\\" serial poem. She used the opportunity to defend the cause of northerners from the increasingly authoritarian southern-based regime. After the start of the civil war in the 1990s, Warsame's compositions emphasized national identity and participation in the post-conflict reconstruction process. Her \\"Aan kuu Taliyo\\" humorously satirized political infighting. Warsame also supported former Vice President of Somalia Muhammad Ali Samatar during a civil lawsuit that had been filed against him in 2009, believing that he was being unfairly singled out as a member of the former regime. In addition, Warsame was critical of the secessionist administration in Somalia's northwestern Somaliland region. She felt that the enclave's leadership was tyrannical and wanted to force a separatist agenda upon her northern constituents. Her song \\"Libdhimeyside Laas Caanood, Laba maahaa Waddankeennu\\" in particular hails the city of Las Anod, which Somaliland troops began occupying in 2007, for its historical role as the cradle of the nationalist and anti-colonial Dervish State. The title translates as \\"O Las Anod, you will always remain a part of Somalia, Our country is one.\\" =Member of the Federal Parliament of Somalia= Following the establishment of the Federal Parliament of Somalia in 2012, Warsame moved to the capital Mogadishu, situated in the southeastern Banaadir province. She subsequently served as an MP in the new legislature, representing the northeastern Puntland regional state's constituency. Abdulkadir Ali speaking at an event in commemoration of Saado Ali Warsame. On 23 July 2014, Warsame and her driver were gunned down by unknown assailants in Mogadishu as she was being driven to a hotel. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was part of its assassination campaign against Somali legislators. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay, Ambassador of Germany to Somalia Andreas Peschke, and the U.S. Department of State all issued statements condemning the assassination and expressing condolences to Warsame's family. Somali American community leaders in Minnesota also requested a full investigation by the State Department into her death. Additionally, Prime Minister Ahmed vowed to apprehend the perpetrators. In April 2015, two Al-Shabaab operatives were sentenced to death and later executed for Warsame's assassination and the murder of several other federal officials. On 24 July 2014, the Federal Government held a state funeral in honour of Warsame at the Villa Somalia presidential compound in the capital. President Mohamud, Prime Minister Ahmed, Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari, First Deputy Speaker of Parliament Jaylaani Nur Ikar, Mayor of Mogadishu Hassan Mohamed Hussein Mungab, cabinet ministers, legislators, popular artists and former colleagues all attended the service, where Janaza prayers were read.

Hong Kong issued revenue stamps from 1867 to the 1990s, both when it was a British colony as well as when it was under Japanese occupation. Stamp Duty Hong Kong's first revenues were issued in 1867. A set of nine stamps from 3c to $10 was issued portraying Queen Victoria. In 1873 a 2c value was added in a smaller format, and this is a very rare stamp. In January 1880, a stamp from the 1867 issue was surcharged, and this was valid for both postal and fiscal use. Postage stamps were overprinted S.O. (Stamp Office) or S.D. (Stamp Duty) in 1885 as provisionals when there was a shortage of stamps. The 1867 designs were reissued in new colours in 1885, and this time further values and designs were also added. There were further provisional surcharges up to 1898. In 1903 a new set was issued showing King Edward VII, who had acceded to the throne following Victoria's death two years earlier. Twenty six values from 1c to $200 were issued, and some are very rare while others are commoner. Some values of this set were reissued in a new watermark in 1907. Ten-cent stamps were surcharged for use as five-cents in 1908 following a shortage of stamps. Later that year a numeral 5c stamp was issued replacing these provisionals. A new set in a design similar to the 1903 issue but with the portrait of King George V was issued in 1912, with twenty three values from 5c to $200. In 1921, this issue and the 1908 numeral design were reissued on paper with a different watermark. A 10c provisional was issued in 1933. In 1939, new stamps portraying King George VI were issued. These exist in a number of different watermarks and perforations and continued to be issued until 1951 (with the exception of the Japanese occupation from 1941‚Äì45). Provisional surcharges were also issued in 1948 and 1951. In 1953, a 15c Queen Elizabeth II postage stamp was overprinted STAMP DUTY. This was followed by a new set a year later with ten values from 10c to $20. During Elizabeth's reign, the numeral design of 1908 was again reissued with different sizes, watermarks and papers. The last issue of Hong Kong revenues was in 1980, when a set of thirteen values from $3 to $1200 was issued. These are common and readily available. Two surcharges on this issue were made around 1990. Overprints Various stamp duty issues were overprinted for other purposes between the early 20th century and 1978. The first of these were for bills of exchange. Many stamps exist overprinted or handstamped B OF E or BILL OF EXCHANGE in a variety of formats. These continued to be used until they were withdrawn in 1978. Around 1945, King George V stamp duty issues from the 1920s were overprinted CONTRACT NOTE. These are very rare as limited stocks were available for overprinting. Later various King George VI postage or stamp duty stamps were similarly overprinted. Similar overprints were issued on Queen Elizabeth II revenues in 1956, and these remained in use until the 1970s. Various provisional surcharges were also issued. Between 1946 and 1948, four postage or stamp duty stamps were also issued overprinted RECEIPT STAMP, or additionally surcharged. Japanese occupation On 25 December 1941, British forces in Hong Kong surrendered to Japan following several days of fierce fighting. From 1942, Japanese revenue stamps were used in Hong Kong, and these can only be identified by their cancellations. In 1943 and 1944, Japanese postage or revenue stamps were overprinted for Hong Kong. New designs were also issued printed locally, showing either the HSBC building (then the government headquarters) or Mount Fuji. Collecting Hong Kong revenues are popular with collectors from Hong Kong or China. On 6 October 2013 a 1903 1c stamp sold on eBay for $7887. This stamp is very rare as only two recently discovered copies are known, and it was previously thought that this was never issued. It is therefore one of the greatest rarities of British Empire revenue philately.

Biography Friedel Stern was born in Leipzig, Germany, in 1917, eldest of four children. Her family was Jewish but not Zionist. However, when anti-Semitism began to take hold in Germany, she stopped her art studies, and, encouraged by her mother, joined the Jewish Scouts movement.See: Chen, Yael, The Funny Side Of Fish, Maariv, February 10, 1999 (Heb) She immigrated to Palestine with this group in 1936 to Kibbutz Kfar Maccabi. However, a short while later she moved to Haifa. She worked as a cook and housemaid and took evening courses in sketching with Professor Hoenich. At the end of the 1930s, she studied art and design at Bezalel art school‚Äù in Jerusalem. During the Second World War, she joined the volunteers in the Auxiliary Women‚Äôs Corps of the British Army as a nurse. In the early 1940s, she was sent to serve in the officers‚Äô school in Gaza and joined the liberation army in Italy, where she was assigned to the camouflage unit.See: Pinkos, Yermi, \\"Lo Nirgaat\\", Hair, March 13, 2003 (Heb) During the war, she sketched and illustrated scenes depicting the daily life of the British soldiers. In 1944 she showed her sketches at the exhibition ‚ÄúAllied Forces Artists‚Äù in Egypt. For her military service, Friedel was awarded a citation from the King of Britain.See: Cohen, Zvia (ed.), Israeli Solgers in ww-II, Miskal, Tel Aviv, 2005, p. 145 (heb) After her release from the army, Friedel returned to Palestine and started to work as a graphic designer of maps at the Survey of Palestine, which was later to become the Measuring Department. One of her innovations was illustrating the drawing of the maps of Palestine. Such a collection of maps was published in 1953 under the title Israel in 14 Pictorial Maps.Israel in 14 Pictorial Maps, Kerem Hayesod, 1953 In 1946 Friedel started to publish cartoons in the journal Bamahane. It was then that she designed her signature composed of her first name: Friedel and a star, symbolizing the meaning of her family name in German ‚ÄúStern‚Äù. This signature was meant to differentiate her from Yossi Stern who was the graphics editor of the journal. Due to the success of this publication, Friedel started to publish her cartoons regularly in the newspapers Davar, Dvar Ha‚ÄôShavua and La‚Äôisha. In the 1950s Friedel started to publish journalistic articles where she examined the Israeli society critically. For some of these articles, she disguised herself as various ethnic types. In 1956, for instance, she disguised herself as an immigrant from Morocco and was treated with DDT. For other articles, she worked as a bus ticket conductor, and as an immigrant Ulpan student etc.See: Maoz, Michal, Raeti Yekit Smecha\\", Anashim, September 26, 1983. (heb) Her articles were always illustrated by cartoons. In 1958 she published her book In Short: Israel about a tourist‚Äôs experiences in Israel. Parallel to her journalistic work, Friedel also worked as a graphic designer. In the 1950s and 60‚Äôs she designed posters for the Philatelist Service and the Israeli Post Office. In 1960 she created the series Air Mail Landscape 2 - a series of 10 stamps of Israel Post (the third series of airmail stamps) about Israel‚Äôs cities and sites, thus being the second female stamp designer after Miriam Karoly). Amongst her other works are congratulatory Cards for Independence Day (published by Keren Ha‚ÄôYessod in 1958), a poster for the National Insurance Institute (in the 1950s), a collection album Countries and Nations in Pictures (in the early 1960s) and a poster for the Harp Contest (in the 1960s). Her design style was based on a minimalistic geometric line, suitable for those years.See: Yermi, Pinkus, Haiti Tayeret Baaretz, Israel Crrtoon Museum, Holon, 2012, p. 19. (heb) For years Friedel was the only female cartoonist in Israel and differently, from her colleagues she rarely dealt with political or military subjects. Her uniqueness was in daily life subjects, exposing the grotesque or absurd aspects of Israeli society.See: Miller, Irit, Lo Rak Homor, Mana katz Museum, Haifa, 1999, p. 6. (heb) From the artistic point of view, Friedel‚Äôs work is characterized by a geometric line and relatively little use of color. From 1962 and 1992 Friedel lectured in the sketching department of the Bezalel Academy. For many years she volunteered in the Organization of IDF Invalids and in Beit Ha‚ÄôLohem. For this activity, she was awarded the President‚Äôs Volunteering Award of 1999. In 2004 she was awarded the Dosh Cartoon Award. Friedel never married. She died in Tel Aviv-Yafo in 2006, shortly before her 90th birthday and was buried at Kibbutz Einat. Awards and recognition Friedel's library was donated to the Beit Ariela Library in Tel Aviv. Her artistic legacy was donated in 2010 to the Israeli Cartoon and Comics Museum in Holon. Since 2012, the Museum has organized a yearly cartoon contest called ‚ÄúThe Friedel Stern Humorist Cartoon Contest‚Äù in her memory.

Putin recalled the ancient Chersonesos where Prince Vladimir was baptized, on the graves of Russian soldiers on Sevastopol ‚Äî the home of the Black Sea Fleet. Noted that the Crimean Tatars suffered cruel injustice in Soviet times, together with the other peoples, including the Russian people. After the Crimean Tatars have returned to their land, new solutions for a complete rehabilitation of the Crimean Tatar people are required. He proposed three equal official languages for Crimea - Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar. The President stressed that in the heart of the Crimean people, Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia. Bolsheviks included a significant amount of the historical Russian southern land into the Ukrainian SSR without taking into account the national composition of its population. Further, in 1954, the Crimea and Sevastopol in the Ukrainian SSR passed. This decision was taken in violation of constitutional norms, behind the scenes, in a totalitarian state residents of Crimea and Sevastopol nothing asked. That decision was seen as a formality, since the territory transferred within the same country. Putin condemned the West‚Äôs reaction to the events in the Crimea and sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian politicians. Russian President expressed gratitude to the people of China, praised the restraint of India. Appealed to the U.S. freedom-loving people, stressing that freedom of the Crimean population is the same value. Referring to the fact that not all allies sympathized with Germany in 1989, it merged with the German Democratic Republic, Putin said that while the USSR supported the Germans sincere desire for national unity. The President expressed confidence that German citizens support the aspirations of the Russian world to restore the unity of 'Crimea will remain Russian and Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar. It will be home to the representatives of all the peoples living there. But he will never Bandera'. Putin assured that Russia will not seek confrontation with the West and the East, and stressed that Russia and Ukraine ‚Äî are one people. Ukraine will continue to live millions of Russian citizens, which means that Russia will always defend their interests. Putin‚Äôs speech lasted 45 minutes. During the speech, Putin used the term \\"natsional-predateli\\" (‚Äúnational-traitors‚Äù) which is a calque from the German term Nationalverr√§ter.Felicity J. Rash.

They resorted to terror, murder and pogroms. Nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites executed this coup. They continue to set the tone in Ukraine to this day.\\" Nevertheless, he expressed appreciation to those protesting peacefully against corruption, inefficient state management and poverty. The audience has been applauding Putin for over 5 minutes at the beginning of the speech and at least 2‚Äì3 minutes thereafter. Many were shedding tears. Reactions Glenn Kessler from The Washington Post reported that several of Putin's statements were \\"dubious and false\\". UK government's response to points made by President Putin lists 7 points, among them the crimean \\"referendum\\", the accusation of terror, pogrom and murder as well as the legal status of the Ukrainian government; \\" (...)

It stars Genevieve Nnaji, Yemi Blaq, Fred Amata, Joke Silva, Elvina Ibru and Ibinabo Fiberesima, with Special Appearances from Segun Arinze and D'Banj. It tells the story of Jemima (Genevieve Nnaji), whose love life with her boyfriend, Fredrick (Fred Amata) hasn't been on the smooth path as she expected - as Fred's mother (Joke Silva) is always dictating the tune. She decides to make a call to her sister, Tare (Ibinabo Fiberesima) on a day, but she dials the wrong number which leads to her getting acquainted with Sadiq (Yemi Blaq). Plot Jemima (Genevieve Nnaji) isn't having the best of times. Her boyfriend, Frederick (Fred Amata), is too busy with other parts of his life to give her the attention and affection she needs, and she is distracted at work. A writer, she records her feelings in a series of \\"letters to a stranger\\" on her computer. While she is on a months' leave of absence, a chance misdial of the telephone introduces her to Sadig (Yemi Blaq). Sadiq, too, is a writer, and he seems far more affectionate towards Jemima than Frederick. Torn by her feelings for the men, Jemima plans to return Frederick's engagement ring to him, but Frederick discovers her \\"letters to a stranger\\" and learns how unhappy Jemima has been. They talk, but she cannot answer the question he asks as to why she had not left him for his neglect. Eventually, Jemima must make a choice and tells her two suitors that she will deliver the news by telephone. On Monday morning, she will call the man she has chosen first. But when the time comes, she decides instead to begin by calling the other, to apologize and explain. When she dials Sadiq to tell him that she has decided to marry Frederick, she finds he has turned off his phone. She assumes he has given her up easily and only months later learns that this is not true. Sadiq reveals to her that he had turned off the phone because he knew what her choice would be; a gift she had given him had been addressed to Frederick.

The walled courtyard with the bell tower in front. Chapel interior with the glass altar wall and the cross standing outside. Otaniemi Chapel (, ) is a Lutheran chapel located in the Otaniemi campus of Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. History The chapel was designed by the architect couple Heikki and Kaija Siren for a 1954 architectural competition, completed in 1956 and inaugurated in 1957. Located in the Student Village of the Otaniemi campus, the chapel was originally built by the student union of the Helsinki University of Technology. The students wanted something to remind them of \\"the wholeness of life and the values of human life\\" in the middle of their technical studies. The student union sold the chapel to Espoo parish in 1972. On 22 July 1976 the chapel burned down due to arson but it was built again to its original form in 1978. The chapel has been gradually renovated in recent years: the technical systems of the building in 2008, the organ in 2009 and the sacristy in 2011. Architecture The chapel is located on a small hill in the woods, surrounded by pine and birch trees. The main materials of the chapel are red brick and wood, tying the chapel together with other brick buildings in the campus area, including the main university buildings designed by Alvar Aalto. The building is entered from a walled courtyard that also has a bell tower. The chapel itself, past a clubroom, has two side walls made of bricks. The parallel walls \\"channel a progression from a secular to a spiritual view of nature\\": the altar wall made of glass, opening to the surrounding nature with a white cross standing among the trees. The presence of nature is almost pantheistic. Functions The chapel currently belongs to Tapiola parish and hosts baptismal ceremonies, weddings and funerals. It is also the gathering place for many associations, such as Christian student organizations and Bible study groups. The chapel has 150 seats and a 10-stop organ by Kangasala organ factory. Awards and recognition In 2009 the chapel was awarded the International Carlo Scarpa Prize for Gardens. The jury called the building \\"masterly\\" simple and transparent, hailing the way nature, architecture and society come together at the site. The National Board of Antiquities has listed the chapel as a nationally significant built cultural heritage site as part of the Otaniemi campus and Docomomo has selected the building as a significant example of modern architecture in Finland.

Early life He was the eldest son of William Livingstone, 6th Lord Livingston, by his wife Agnes, second daughter of Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming. Among his siblings were Jean Livingston, who married Alexander Elphinstone, 4th Lord Elphinstone, the Treasurer of Scotland, and Margaret Livingston, who married Lewis Bellenden and Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney. He supported the faction of Mary, Queen of Scots and at the capture of Dumbarton Castle on 2 May 1571, he was taken prisoner, but appears to have been freed soon afterwards. Career On his father making submission to the Regent Morton on 22 May 1574, Livingstone was relieved of bonds, which he had entered into for the deliverance of Callendar House. In September 1579 he accompanied James VI of Scotland from Stirling to Edinburgh, on the occasion of his royal entry, and on 24 September 1580 he was appointed a gentleman of the king's bedchamber. Livingstone was a member of the assize for the trial of Morton in 1581; and he remained a loyal supporter of Esm√© Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox. When the Duke had to depart from Edinburgh on 5 September 1582, Livingstone accompanied him westwards to Glasgow, and he was also connected with the conspiracy of the Duke on 30 November to seize Edinburgh. When the Duke left for France on 20 December following, Livingstone accompanied him, but after the Duke's death on 26 May 1583 he returned to Scotland. For his prompt action in taking possession of Stirling Castle on 22 April 1584, after it had been vacated by the Ruthven raiders, he was declared to have done good service. =Lord Livingstone= Alexander Livingstone succeeded his father as Lord Livingstone in 1592. Although he may well have been concerned in negotiations with Spain, he was on 31 October 1593 appointed a member of the commission for the trial of the Earls of Angus, Huntly, and Erroll for the same treasonable conduct, in the Spanish blanks plot; and he signed the act of abolition in their favour on 26 November. On 18 January 1594 he was named a commissioner of taxation, and in May 1594 he was chosen a lord of the articles. At the baptism of Prince Henry on 23 August 1594, Livingstone carried the towel. In November 1596 the care of Princess Elizabeth was entrusted to him and his wife Helen Livingstone, Countess of Linlithgow, which caused continuing controversy because she was a Roman Catholic. He was chosen one of the members of the Scottish privy council, on its reconstitution in December 1598. In March 1600 he had a charter of novo damus of the barony of Callendar, in which the town of Falkirk was erected into a free burgh of barony. =Earl of Linlithgow= On 25 December 1600 Livingstone was, on the occasion of the baptism of Prince Charles, created Earl of Linlithgow, Lord Livingstone and Callendar.G.E.

He and Lady Livingstone remained guardians of the Princess Elizabeth until the departure of King James to London in 1603, and after the princess was restored to the king at Windsor an act was passed discharging them of their duty. In July 1604 the Earl was appointed one of the commissioners for a union with England. In 1621 he voted, through his procurator, against the Five Articles of Perth. Personal life On 26 January 1583, he was married to Lady Helen Hay (‚Äì1627). She was the eldest daughter of Andrew Hay, 8th Earl of Erroll and his first wife (and cousin), Lady Jean Hay (only child of William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll). Together, they had three sons and two daughters: * John, Master of Livingston, who died unmarried. * Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow (d. 1648), who married Lady Elizabeth Gordon, second daughter of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly and Lady Henrietta Stuart (eldest daughter of Esm√© Stuart, 1st Duke of Lennox). * James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar (d. ), who married Hon. Margaret Seton, the widow of Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline who was the only daughter of James Hay, 7th Lord Hay of Yester and Lady Margaret Kerr (third daughter of Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian). * Anne Livingston (d. 1632), who married to Alexander Montgomerie, 6th Earl of Eglinton. * Margaret Livingston (d. ), who married John Fleming, 2nd Earl of Wigtown.

It was completed in 1952 and was later published as part of the collection K√©t k√°non (Two Canons).  Composition  Ligeti composed Pletyk√°z√≥ asszonyok in 1952, when he was studying in the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and used a text by Hungarian poet S√°ndor We√∂res. However, it was not commonly performed and was only published in 1999 by Schott Music as a collection called K√©t k√°non, together with Ha foly√≥v√≠z voln√©k (1947). These two canons were conceived and written separately, as the 1947 composition was based on slovak tunes translated into Hungarian, unlike Pletyk√°z√≥ asszonyok.  Analysis  This short composition takes approximately one to two minutes to perform. It is a four-part canon scored for a mixed choir which should consist of sopranos, altos, tenors and basses, even though it is typically performed exclusively by women. The text used in the composition was written by S√°ndor We√∂res, but was never published separately. It has been translated and adapted into German by Hilger Schallehn and into English by Desmond Clayton. Pletyk√°z√≥ asszonyok is a very rapid canon, marked Vivacissimo. The score has only one staff per system, and all four voices should start a bar away from each other, therefore creating tone clusters, a technique thoroughly used and developed by Ligeti throughout his career. It is usually performed three times, with no interruptions, the first time in unison, even though such an indication is not present in the original score.

The crash, which killed everyone aboard the plane, inspired the song \\"Deportee\\" by Woody Guthrie. Some of the passengers were being returned to Mexico at the termination of their bracero contracts, while others were illegal immigrants being deported. Initial news reports listed only the pilot, first officer, and stewardess, with the remainder listed only as \\"deportees.\\" Only 12 of the victims were initially identified. The Hispanic victims of the accident were placed in a mass grave at Holy Cross Cemetery in Fresno, California, with their grave marked only as \\"Mexican Nationals\\". Accident The Douglas DC-3 aircraft, owned by Airline Transport Carriers of Burbank, California, was chartered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly twenty-eight Mexican citizens, who were being deported to the INS Deportation Center in El Centro, California. For reasons never explained, pilot Frank Atkinson and co-pilot Marion Ewing took a DC-3 that had seats for only twenty-six passengers (seven hours overdue for a routine and required safety inspection) for the flight, instead of an aircraft certified to carry thirty-two passengers. Arriving in Oakland, California, after a routine flight, the crew was joined by INS guard Frank Chaffin. The flight was to refuel at Burbank, California, before continuing to El Centro. At approximately 10:30am, workers at the Fresno County Industrial Road Camp, located northwest of Coalinga, California, noticed the DC-3 trailing white smoke from its port engine. The port wing suddenly ripped off, spilling nine passengers out of the gaping hole in the fuselage. The aircraft caught fire and spiralled to the ground near Los Gatos Creek, exploding in a ball of fire. The investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Authority discovered that a fuel leak in the port engine's fuel pump ignited and the slip-stream fanned the flames to a white hot intensity, acting like an oxy-acetylene torch, burning through the main-spar, causing the crash. Initial news reports listed only the pilot, first officer, stewardess, and the immigration guard, with the remainder listed only as \\"deportees\\". Only 12 of the victims were initially identified. The Hispanic victims of the accident were placed in a mass grave at Holy Cross Cemetery in Fresno, California, with their grave marked only as \\"Mexican Nationals\\". The grave is with two rows of caskets and not all of the bodies were buried the first day, but the caskets at the site did have an overnight guard. Woody Guthrie song, \\"Deportee\\" Singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie wrote a poem in 1948 lamenting the anonymity of the workers killed in the crash, identified only as \\"deportees\\" in media reports. When Guthrie's poem was set to music a decade later by college student Martin Hoffman, it became the folk song \\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\\". The song was popularized by Pete Seeger, and was subsequently performed by Arlo Guthriehttps://www.pandora.com/artist/lyrics/arlo- guthrie/arlo-guthrie/deportees/TRJqgnbrf5tfmjX Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Julie Felix, Cisco Houston,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOqjlRsUnBM Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Paul Kelly, Martyn Joseph, The Byrds, Richard Shindell and Ani DiFranco among others. Aftermath Cesar Chavez, later to become founder of the United Farm Workers union, learned of the tragic crash while serving in the US Navy, helping convince him that farm workers should be treated \\"as important human beings and not as agricultural implements\\". The names of all the victims were published in local papers in 1948. In 2009, writer Tim Z. Hernandez began to seek out the gravesite and those names. With the help of others, by July 2013 all had been identified (some of the names were misspelled in the records), and the money raised for a more fitting memorial. On September 2, 2013 (Labor Day), a Deportee Memorial Headstone was unveiled at a mass in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Fresno attended by more than 600. The memorial includes all twenty-eight names of the migrant workers, which included three women, and one man born in Spain, not Mexico as widely reported.

The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS over a weekend, and released on 9 March 2014 as free and open-source software subject to the MIT license. There is also a version for the Linux terminal. 2048 has been described as similar to the app Threes released a month earlier. Cirulli, the creator, himself described 2048 as being \\"conceptually similar\\" to Threes.https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/beat-addictive-puzzling- game-2048-121850575.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2014/mar/31/threes- creators-2048-game-clone  Gameplay  A completed game of 2048. The 2048 tile can be seen in the bottom-right corner. 2048 is played on a gray 4√ó4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-2048-latest-gaming- craze-20140324-story.html Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi- tn-2048-latest-gaming-craze-20140324-story.html If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two. https://www.dailydot.com/debug/2048-math-game/ A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps track of the user's score. The user's score starts at zero, and is increased whenever two tiles combine, by the value of the new tile.https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-2048-latest-gaming- craze-20140324-story.html As with many arcade games, the user's best score is shown alongside the current score. A game of 2048 in progress The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board, hence the name of the game. After reaching the 2048 tile, players can continue to play (beyond the 2048 tile) to reach higher scores. When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.https://en.softonic.com/articles/interview-with-the-creator-of-2048 The simple gameplay mechanics (just four directions) allowed it to be used in a promo video for the Myo gesture control armband, and the availability of the code underneath allowed it to be used as a teaching aid for programming; the second-place winner of a coding contest at Matlab Central Exchange was an AI system that would play 2048 on its own. =Strategy= In general, most players will keep the tile with the highest value in the corner. They then add tiles sliding into the biggest tile to make higher tiles.https://www.dailydot.com/debug/how-to-win-2048/  Development  19-year-old Cirulli created the game in a single weekend as a test to see if he could program a game from scratch; he was surprised when his game received over 4 million visitors in less than a week, especially since it was just a weekend project. \\"It was a way to pass the time\\", he said. The game is free to play, Cirulli having said that he was unwilling to make money from \\"something that [he] didn‚Äôt invent\\". He released a free app version of the game for iOS and Android in May 2014. 2048 became a hit, peaking at #44 on the Apple App Store.https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/2048/id840919914 The game has been described by the Wall Street Journal as \\"almost like Candy Crush for math geeks\\", and Business Insider called it \\"Threes on steroids\\". Variations As the source code is available, many additions to the original game, including a score leaderboard, an undo feature, and improved touchscreen playability have been written by other people. All are available to the public. Spinoffs have been released online, as apps and for the Nintendo 3DS, and include versions with elements from the Doge meme, Doctor Who, Flappy Bird and Tetris; there has also been a 3D version and versions with bigger or smaller grids. Cirulli sees these spinoffs as \\"part of the beauty of open source software\\" and does not object to them \\"as long as they add new, creative modifications to the game\\". In 2014, an unofficial clone of the game was published in the iOS app store by Ketchapp, monetized with advertising. There has also been a Doctor Who spinoff of the game.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-06-30/doctor- who-thirteen-game/  Comparisons to other games  2048 has been compared to Flappy Bird by several commentators. Both games' success led to clones being created, and both games have been described as viral and addictive. When asked if he was concerned that his situation would end up as stressed as that of Nguy·ªÖn H√† ƒê√¥ng, the creator of Flappy Bird, Cirulli said that he had \\"already gone through that phase\\" on a smaller scale, and that once he had decided against monetizing 2048, he \\"stopped feeling awkward.\\" It has also been compared to the app Threes and 1024. Cirulli, the creator, described 2048 as a clone of Veewo Studios' app 1024.https://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/26/19-year-old- makes-viral-game-hit-in-a-weekend.html References  External links  * * 2048 source code on GitHub Category:2014 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Open-source video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Single-player online games Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Video game clones Category:Video games developed in Italy Category:Tile-matching video games ","title":"2048 (video game)"},{"id":"42248024","text":"Scott R. Wagner (born September 21, 1955) is an American businessman and politician from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He represented the 28th district in the Pennsylvania State Senate. He was the Republican nominee for Governor of Pennsylvania in the 2018 election, being defeated by incumbent Democrat Tom Wolf.  Early life and education  Wagner is from Spring Garden Township in York County, Pennsylvania. He was raised on a farm. Wagner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in 1973. He then spent one semester at Williamsport Area Community College (now Pennsylvania College of Technology), but left school to pursue business ventures.Segelbaum, Dylan (May 15, 2018). Business career  Wagner bought his first plot of land for $8,500 at age 19, selling it two years later for a $4,000 profit. He then had several successful business ventures including a laundromat and ski shop, as well as buying a number of rental buildings. He also worked as a bail bondsman. In 1985, Wagner co-founded the waste management company York Waste Disposal, a company which made $40 million a year, and which he sold in 1997. He then started Penn Waste in 2000, a company with 400 employees in 2018. The company has received over 30 violations and citations from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection over sixteen years, which Wagner claims have been unfair and overreaching (his company picks up garbage from 180,000 homes). In December 2019, Wagner sold Penn Waste to the Canadian company Waste Connections.David Wenner, Scott Wagner sells Penn Waste to Canadian company, PennLive (January 16, 2020).Logan Hullinger, Scott Wagner's Penn Waste sold to company with Canada, Texas ties, York Dispatch (January 16, 2020). Wagner also owns three other companies, including a trucking company called KBS Trucking. Political career = Pennsylvania Senate (2014‚Äì2018) = Wagner ran in a March 2014 special election for the 28th district in the Pennsylvania Senate. When Ron Miller, an incumbent member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, declared his intentions to run for the seat, Wagner charged the Republican Party with cronyism. Wagner withdrew his name from consideration, but remained a candidate for the regularly scheduled primary election in May 2014. The York County Republicans selected Miller as their nominee, and Wagner chose to run in the special election as a write-in candidate against Miller and Linda Small, the Democratic Party nominee. Wagner ran on a fiscal conservative platform. He ran as an outsider, accusing party leaders of rigging the system against him, and became the first write-in candidate to win election to the Pennsylvania State Senate in history. In the election, Wagner received 10,595 votes (47.7%), Miller received 5,920 votes (26.6%) and Small received 5,704 votes (25.7%). Turnout was less than 14% of all registered voters in the district. He was sworn in on April 2, 2014. In office, Wagner moved the General Assembly in a more fiscally conservative direction. He led efforts to replace Republican Dominic F. Pileggi as Senate majority leader and to install plaques under the Capitol portraits of Senate and House leaders with criminal convictions. Wagner used his own money in campaigns to help Republicans win seats in various parts of the state, and as Chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, he led Senate Republicans to achieve a 34-16 supermajority in the 2016 Pennsylvania Senate election. As Chairman of the Senate Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Wagner ushered the passage of a bill from the committee that would have established protections from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodation based on \\"sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.\\" It was the first time in eleven years of introducing such legislation that it passed a committee, though it did not advance to a vote by the full Senate. Working with Democratic Senator Anthony H. Williams of Philadelphia, Wagner introduced Clean Slate legislation to automatically seal non-violent misdemeanor conviction records after someone remains crime-free for ten years. Wagner and Williams' bill passed the Senate unanimously, and is nearly identical to the House's version which ultimately became law. In the state Senate, Wagner supported natural gas drilling on state lands and called for reducing regulations on the oil and gas industry. Wagner inaccurately asserted in March 2017 that climate change is the result of Earth moving closer to the Sun and from greater body heat emanating from a greater number of humans; this debunked claim is contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change. In December 2017, Wagner voted in favor of a bill in the state legislature that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Governor Wolf vetoed the bill. Wagner later came out in support of a U.S. House bill that would ban abortion as soon as the fetus has a heartbeat. Wagner has also cosponsored bills that would prevent the use of state funds for non-abortion services, such as birth control and cancer screening, at Planned Parenthood. Wagner has been critical of labor unions, and has stated that he supports right-to-work legislation. In 2014, he compared public sector unions to Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Putin, later apologizing for the \\"unfortunate analogy.\\" Wagner resigned from the Senate in June 2018 after winning the Republican nomination for governor. =2018 gubernatorial campaign = Wagner ran as a Republican candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania in the 2018 election, challenging Democratic incumbent Governor Tom Wolf; Wagner became the Republican nominee after winning the primary on May 15, 2018. Wagner contracted Red Mavericks, a media, strategy and fundraising firm led by Harrisburg political operative and lobbyist Ray Zaborney, after having previously decried the use of political consultants. Wagner resigned from the State Senate on June 4, 2018, to focus on his gubernatorial campaign. Prior to the 2018 gubernatorial election, Wagner declined to release his tax returns, suggesting that labor unions will use it to try to organize workers at his company. Wagner's company Penn Waste, which reported $75 million in revenue in 2017, is non-unionized. Wagner and Wolf had a televised debate moderated by Alex Trebek. Wagner originally called for debates in all 67 counties in Pennsylvania. He called Wolf a \\"chicken\\" for not having more debates. In a campaign video, Wagner threatened to \\"stomp all over\\" his opponent's face, saying: \\"Gov. Wolf, let me tell you between now and Nov 6, you better put a catcher's mask on your face because I'm going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes. Because I'm going to win for the state of Pennsylvania, and we are throwing you out of office because, you know what, I'm sick and tired of your negative ads.\\" In a later video, Wagner said, \\"I may have chosen a poor metaphor. I may have had poor choice of words. I shouldn't have said what I said.\\" During the campaign, Wagner was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, which had given him an \\"A\\" rating in the past. Wagner said that he would roll back Wolf's Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (in 2015, Wolf expanded Medicaid to 700,000 Pennsylvanians). After initially suggesting that he might support a bill that would end recognition of same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania, Wagner issued a clarification saying that, if governor, he would veto any bill that restricts marriage rights for same-sex couples. Wagner pledged to eliminating property taxes, including school taxes, statewide, and adopting zero-based budgeting. During his campaign, Wagner said he favored a tougher stance on school bullying, supported school uniforms for all students, and spoke out against standardized testing. Wagner supported leasing Pennsylvania's wholesale liquor industry and privatizing the sale of alcohol, using $500 million in projected savings for education programs. He expressed support for \\"clear sentencing and bail guidelines\\" but did not endorse the elimination of cash bail. Wagner also pledged to reverse Wolf's moratorium on the death penalty, supporting restoration of capital punishment in Pennsylvania. Regarding the opioid epidemic, Wagner said that if elected governor, he would sue pharmaceutical companies. Wagner proposed the creation of a fund to extent loans to people, especially those in poor communities, to open new businesses; he also criticized the state's existing public assistance programs. In a 2018 campaign appearance, a student challenged Wagner's claim that climate change is being caused by human body heat and asked whether his belief was the result of the money he received from the fossil fuel industry. Wagner responded by calling the student \\"young and naive\\" and said that Pennsylvanians are trying to elect a governor, not a scientist. In the November 2018 election, Wagner was easily defeated by Wolf.Dylan Segelbaum & Candy Woodall, 'Back to work': Pa. Gov. Tom Wolf easily wins re-election over Republican Scott Wagner, York Daily Record (November 6, 2018).Ron Southwick, Gov. Tom Wolf wins second term, defeats Scott Wagner, PennLive (November 6, 2018). Wagner spent more than $23 million on his primary campaign and $22 million on his general election campaign.Cost of governor‚Äôs race topped $64M, shy of state record, Associated Press (December 10, 2018). Wagner self-funded most of his campaign, and was his own largest contributor.Despite having three millionaires as candidates, Pa. governor's race didn't break any spending records, PennLive (December 6, 2018). =Republican Party financing and Trump support= A lifelong member of the Republican Party, Wagner has donated more than $3.2 million to state and local campaigns since 2007. Wagner is a supporter of President Donald Trump.Clout: Wagner (again) tangles with tracker in Pa. race for governor, Philadelphia Inquirer (August 25, 2017); also republished by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Wagner has compared himself to Trump, and similarities of style have been commented upon by others. Wagner expressed support for the Trump travel ban and called the Russia investigation \\"a lot of propaganda.\\" Trump endorsed Wagner for governor in 2018. Wagner and the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, Lou Barletta, appeared with Trump at an October 2018 rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. =Antisemitism controversies = In 2017, Wagner denounced billionaire businessman and political donor George Soros (a U.S. citizen since 1961) as a \\"Hungarian Jew\\" who has a \\"hatred for America.\\" Wagner rejected calls from Jewish and Christian clergy asking him to apologize for the remarks, and the Democratic Party in the state denounced his comments as anti-Semitic. In September 2018, Wagner approvingly cited an anonymous anecdote circulating on the conspiratorial website InfoWars that complained that \\"America is 'becoming a nation of victims where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is part of a special group with special rights.\\"  Personal life  Wagner has been married four times. His marriages to legal secretary Candy Overlander, receptionist Ellen Beecher, and translator Silvia Rodriguez ended in divorce. Following his divorce from Rodriguez in 2012, Wagner married former trucking company owner Tracy Higgs in 2014. He has two daughters, Katharine and Cristina. Katharine filed a protection-from-abuse order against him in 2006 but no charges were filed. They later reconciled and she has been employed by him for several years and worked on his Senate campaign.

Relaunch as Solidarity An election placard for Solidarity candidate Ruth Coppinger in the 2020 Irish general election, advocating free public transport. On 10 March 2017, the Anti-Austerity Alliance called a press conference and announced that it would now be relaunched as Solidarity. This name change was made to reflect the \\"many movements emerging on workplace, economic and social issues\\" and that while \\"the AAA has played a key role in campaigns like the water charges and housing\\", that the organisation under the name of Solidarity \\"will continue to do so, but the name will now better reflect our campaigning work on Repeal, LGBTQ issues and equality generally.\\" The electoral alliance and D√°il grouping, Anti-Austerity Alliance‚ÄìPeople Before Profit, was renamed Solidarity‚ÄìPeople Before Profit. Cork City Councillor Lil O'Donnell left the party at the time of the rebranding as Solidarity. Rita Harrold unsuccessfully stood in Dublin at the 2019 European Parliament election. At the 2020 general election, Coppinger lost her seat, leading Barry as the party's only TD. Criticism All Solidarity's elected representatives are members of the Socialist Party, which has led to criticism that Solidarity is a front organisation for the Trotskyist Socialist Party.

Nuo folk religion, or extendedly Chinese popular exorcistic religion, is a variant of Chinese folk religion with its own system of temples, rituals, orders of priests and gods, which is interethnic and practiced across central and southern China but is also intimately connected to the Yi and Tujia people. It arose as an exorcistic religious movement, which is the original meaning of nu√≥ (). It has strong influences from Taoism. One of the most distinguishing characters of Nuo folk religion is its iconographic style, which represents the gods as wooden masks or heads. This is related to its own mythology, which traces the origin of Nuo to the first two humans, who were unjustly killed by beheading and are since then worshipped as responsive divine ancestors. Nuo rituals began as efficacious methods to worship them, Lord Nuo and Lady Nuo. Since the 1980s Nuo folk religion has undergone a revitalisation in China, and today is a folk religion endorsed by the central government. Nuo priests are classified as wu (shamans) and their historical precursors were the fangxiangshi (\\"masters who assist the (astral) square\\"). General theory =Cosmology= Nuo cosmology is based on a yin and yang theory, clearly represented in mythology, otherwise explainable as a world in which potentiality and actuality, supernature and nature, form a complementary and dialectical duality which is the order of the universe. Man is an active participant within this order, interplaying with the world of divinity in a creative manner. Nuo mythology also tells of a highest goddess,TiƒÅnxiƒÅn ( \\"Heavenly Immortal\\"), who is directly involved since the origin of humanity in triggering this dialogue between the spiritual and the material. The primary form of dialogue is the worship of ancestors, and this is reflected in the patriarchal structure of Tujia society. =Gods= Ancestral couple: Nuogong and Nuopo The highest deities in the Nuo pantheon are Lord Nuo ( Nu√≥g≈çng) and Lady Nuo (Nu√≥p√≥ ), the two ancestors of humanity, according to mythology, whose sacrifice gave origin to Nuo practices. When a Nuo ceremony is performed, the ancestral couple is represented by carved wooden statues erected in front of the temple, while all lesser gods are placed behind them. In simpler rituals, they are seen as embodiments of all the other gods. Three Purities and the Jade Deity Generally, right below the ancestral couple of Nuogong and Nuopo come the Three Pure Ones ( SƒÅnqƒ´ng). These are the main trinity of Taoist theology, and were introduced among the Tujia by Han Chinese who moved to their areas. Apart from the trinity and some elaborate ritual styles, Nuo folk religion has not acquired the philosophical contents of Taoism, as the purpose of Nuo practices is mainly to \\"nourish\\" Nuo gods. Directly below the Three Pure Ones there is the Jade Deity ( Y√πd√¨), another deity from Taoist theology, who is invoked by Nuo priests by blowing into a peculiar ritual instrument, an ox horn. The Jade Deity is conceived as the commander of all lesser gods, so in order to communicate with them it is necessary to call upon him first. Three Worlds' Deities, Five Directions' Deities and the Enthroned Deity Below the Jade Deity come the Deities of the Three Worlds ( SƒÅnhu√°ng) and then the Deities of the Five Directions ( W«îfƒÅngd√¨), both groups common to pre-Taoist Chinese religion. The triplet is formed by the patron of heaven ( TiƒÅnhu√°ng, who is Fuxi), the patron of earth ( Dehu√°ng, who is Nuwa) and the patron of humanity ( R√©nhu√°ng, who is Shennong). The other group is formed by the Yellow Deity of the centre of the cosmos, the Green or Blue Deity of the east, the Red Deity of the south, the White Deity of the east, and the Black Deity of the north. As in Chinese religion they have a cosmological significance corresponding to various aspects of nature and are believed to have been incarnated in historical personages. Below the Three Patrons and the Five Deities there is the Enthroned Deity, who is considered to be incarnated in the present time. The most prominent contemporary government figure of China is believed to be the Enthroned God. In Nuo shrines there is often a tablet with the inscription \\"a long life to the god on the throne\\". Founders of priestly orders Every order of Nuo priests has its own founders, who are honoured at dedicated altars ( shƒ´t√°n, \\"order's altar\\"). The ancestors of the order are invoked during every ritual performance and in the divine hierarchy they come right below the Enthroned Deity. The three earliest Nuo ritualists common to nearly all the orders are Yan Sanlang, Liu Wulang and Huang Wanlang. There are also a variety of gods of nature and of human affairs, such as the Door Gods, the Well God, the Hearth God, the Land God and the Wealth God, which are those with an immediate relationship with people despite their lower rank in the Nuo pantheon. Temples and ceremonies The setting of Nuo activities are distinct temples ( nu√≥mi√†o, \\"exorcism's temple\\") and private altars ( nu√≥t√°n). The main task of Nuo practices is to strengthen the power of gods as much as possible so that they can exorcise malevolent beings. Nuo ceremonies ( nu√≥ y√≠) can involve dance performance ( nu√≥ w«î), songs ( nu√≥ gƒì), sacrifices ( nu√≥ j√¨) and the Nuo opera ( '). Japanese Shinto rituals with Nuo origins Japanese Shinto ceremonial h≈çs≈çshi at Heian Shrine (2010). During the Heian period (794-1185), the Japanese adopted into Shinto many Tang dynasty (618-907) Chinese customs, including the fangxiangshi (the precursor of Nuo priests) known in Japanese as h≈çs≈çshi who would lead a funeral procession and exorcise demons from a burial mound. This practice was merged with traditional Japanese exorcistic rites such as the Shinto ofuda (\\"talisman with the name of a kami\\"). The earliest record was the (c. 797) Shoku Nihongi history,Gras, Alexandre (2004), \\"\\", Issues in Language and Culture 5: 35-53. which mentions a h≈çs≈çshi exorcist officiating at the burial ceremonies for Emperor Sh≈çmu (756), Emperor K≈çnin (781), and Emperor Kanmu (806). The Ky≈çgen actor Nomura Mannoj≈ç noted that Chinese nuo practices were the 8th-century source for the Japanese tsuina or setsubun (\\"ritual to exorcise evil spirits on the last day of winter\\"), and proposed that supernatural power links the Chinese nuo performer fangxiangshi and the Japanese gigaku masked character Chid≈ç (\\"govern the way\\") who leads a ceremony.Fukushima, Yoshiko (2005), \\"Masks, Interface of Past and Future: Nomura Mannoj≈ç's Shingigaku\\", Asian Theatre Journal 22.2: 249-268. In Japanese tradition and art, the h≈çs≈çshi wears a four-eyed mask rather than the original four-eyed bearskin.

First published in 1928, it is composed of eighteen romances with subjects like the night, death, the sky, and the moon. All of the poems deal with the Romani people (gypsies) and their culture, but only as a theme used to carry the larger message that the poet was trying to convey. The Romancero gitano was instantly popular and remains Garc√≠a Lorca's best known book of poetry. It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. Garc√≠a Lorca himself described the work as a \\"carved altar piece\\" of Andalusia with \\"gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of C√≥rdoba. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles\\". The book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world; it would only be until much later in his life that he gained notability as a playwright. For the rest of his life, the writer would search for the elements of Andalusian culture, trying to find its essence without resorting to the \\"picturesque\\" or the clich√©d use of \\"local colour\\".

Plot Basara Tojo is a high school student studying at Hijirigasaka Academy when his father Jin suddenly gets \\"remarried\\" and asks Basara if he wants to have sisters. Basara meets his two cute stepsisters, Mio Naruse and Maria Naruse. After his father departs overseas, Basara quickly finds that the two sisters are actually part of a demon clan, and he is meant to be with the hero clan. Mio, a Demon princess, forcibly attempts to make a master and servant contract with Basara, but Maria has it end up being the opposite, with Basara as the master. Basara is then always getting into ecchi scenarios, more the while, to protect Mio from being pursued by other demons who are after her heritage passed down by the former Demon Lord Wilbert. Characters =Main= ; : :Basara Tojo is a Year 1 high school student at Hijirigasaka Academy and the protagonist of the story. As a member of a hero clan, he grows up in a hidden rural village. Basara wields the formerly cursed sword Brynhildr. Basara is the only son of Jin Tojo, formerly acknowledged to be the 'Strongest Hero' in the village. As Jin's son, great things are expected of Basara and he is unusually strong even as a youth. Basara possesses the skill 'Banishing Shift', which nullifies any skill directed against him. Five years earlier, when Jin is on a trip, the seal of the S-Ranked 'Evil Spirit' is broken. Many people, including his friends and family, are killed by the spirit. When he sees the Evil Spirit trying to harm his childhood friend, Yuki, his Banishing Shift goes out of control, causing a great crater to form, obliterating the bodies of those slain except Yuki, and also cleansing the area of the evil spirit. Yuki is spared and the cursed sword Brynhildr is cleansed. Because of this, he is confined in the village and when Basara's father returns he insists that Basara be released. Basara is released, but only on the condition that Jin lose his title as a hero. Jin chooses the release of his son and they move to the city. In the present, Basara's father tells him that he is remarrying and that Basara is going to have two younger step-sisters, Mio and Maria. The four of them move into a new house (since the girls' mother is away overseas) and Jin is soon called away on business. The girls take advantage and try to force Basara to leave the house using magic. However, this backfires and Basara tells them to leave. He then contacts his father who reveals the girls' true nature to Basara and why he took them in. Having decided to protect them as their older brother, and in spite of their deception, Basara goes after the girls and saves Mio's life. Maria has Basara and Mio perform a master-slave magical contract that allows them to know each other's location. But, Maria unexpectedly makes Basara the master and Mio the slave, not the other way around and because Maria used Succubus magic to form the contract, the penalty for a disloyal servant is a strong aphrodisiac effect that can only be relieved by the touch of the master, leading to a strong orgasmic release. He has also entered a pact with Yuki in order to boost their fighting strength. ; : :Mio, the titular heroine, is a Demon princess and heir of the former Demon Lord, Wilbert, as well as niece to the current Moderate Faction leader, Ramsus. She grows up in the care of some of Wilbert's followers ignorant of her heritage. Mio becomes aware of her heritage and inherits her true father's abilities after his death only six months before meeting the Tojo family. She and Maria are hiding from the current Demon Lord Leoheart's minions who want to kill her for the powers that she inherited. This is the reason why Jin Tojo takes Mio and her succubus retainer, Maria, in to protect them and prevent the current Demon Lord from becoming stronger. Mio is not pleased with the results of Maria's bonding spell, but she eventually develops feelings for Basara. However, whenever he accidentally walks in on her naked, she constantly says she will kill him a hundred times, with her usually hitting him with her magic. When she needs to be submitted due to the aphrodisiac effects of the pact, her most sensitive area is her breasts. At the end of the Light Novel series, she is one of the first of Basara‚Äôs harem to become pregnant with his child. ; : :Maria is a succubus and is Mio's follower and guardian. Maria loves Mio like a sister and is willing to give her own life to protect her. However, true to her succubus nature, Maria likes to tease and trick Basara whenever she can, but she genuinely likes him and considers him to be her older brother, although she seems to enjoy getting him in perverted situations. All that leaves him uncomfortable, as she is also responsible for Basara's and Mio's moments alone, involving the two in uncomfortable positions or moments, that may get both naked. Her tricks often get her in trouble and results in Mio punishing her. It is later revealed that she has a much more adult form that is an extreme opposite of her lolita form, being an incredibly seductive adult. She later becomes pregnant with Basara‚Äôs child along with the rest of his harem. ; : :Yuki is a member of the Hero Tribe and Basara Tojo's childhood friend, who speaks in the Kansai dialect. She is rather calm and serious person, who only shows her more affectionate side to Basara as she has had a crush on him since they were children. She is one of the observers watching Mio Naruse and is the Class Representative of Basara and Mio's class in Hijirigasaka Academy. Unlike nearly all of the other people in the Hero Tribe, she does not resent Basara regarding the incident five years ago. She holds Basara as the most important thing in her life despite stating that she is looking out for everyone else because she knows that his people have turned on him, not the other way around. Yuki is the sister of Kurumi Nonaka and wields the Spirit Sword, Sakuya. She is the second person to make a master- servant contract with Basara (something she agreed to with no hesitation) and even formed it in the same manner as Mio, with the aphrodisiac effects, and she needs to be submitted (if anything she almost tries to disobey Basara so that she has to submit). It is seen and confirmed by Maria that Yuki's most sensitive spot is her buttocks. She later becomes pregnant with Basara‚Äôs child along with the rest of his harem. ; : :Yuki's younger sister and also a member of the Hero Tribe. Kurumi has a hostile attitude towards Basara, but after being saved by Basara during their fight she realizes what Yuki knew all along‚Äîthat he continues to blame himself for not being able to control his ability which caused the accident five years ago‚Äîand develops a crush on him as well. She specializes in summoning spirits. Kurumi's most sensitive spot is her underarms. She later joins Basara's group as the fourth female. Of everyone, Kurumi is the main victim of Maria's sexual games, being frequently manipulated to be subjected by the latter's \\"succubus baptism\\" quite a lot in a number of situations; Maria outright states that she is \\"venting her libido on the poor girl\\". However, the two of them do genuinely become friends. She later gets pregnant with Basara‚Äôs child. ; : : Another demon, made by Zolgia to be his right-hand, sent to keep an eye on Mio alongside Lars, who is originally envious of the pacts that Basara has with Maria, Mio and Yuki, since they care for each other. She later joins Basara's group as the fifth female and third demon girl following Zolgia's defeat and her defection to the Moderate faction. After spending time with Maria's mother, Sheera, Basara discovers that her bust had become considerably larger. She and Basara are convinced by Sheera to make a third master-servant pact, to not only increase their strength but also to protect Zest, who would be in danger should the tension between the demon factions increase. Although Zest was able make a proper master-servant pact with Basara, unlike Mio and Yuki, the aphrodisiac effects of the curse still activate due to Zest's own doubts of her worthiness of being Basara's servant. In contrast to her serious nature during battle, Zest is actually meek and timid on the outside; she sometimes dresses as a maid for Basara and adds the \\"-sama\\" honorific to his name. She later becomes one the first girls pregnant with Basara‚Äôs child. =Supporting= ; : :Jin is Basara's father, and he is also known as the War God. He has two wives - one is a Demon Lord and the other one is an Angel (Nephilim). He knows of and sympathizes with Mio's situation and that is why he decides to protect her. As a foreign correspondent Jin is largely absent from the Tojo home. His strength is so famous that it kept the Demon Lord Wilbert at bay and almost defeated the Demon Lord Leohart. ; : : A masked Demon sent to spy on Mio who disguises himself as her and Basara's classmate, but after being defeated and nearly killed, he befriends Basara and they form an uneasy alliance. He is capable of creating dolls to take his place and fights using barriers. Mio's foster parents were his caretakers in the orphanage he grew up in, so he agreed to help Basara on the condition he could kill Zolgia himself, to fulfill his wish and avenge his caretakers. ; : : A member of the Hero Tribe who wields the cursed spear, Byakko. He is Basara's childhood friend, but has resented him since the incident five years ago. He strongly believes that Basara has forgotten the incident and that any who side with a demon needs to be killed. ; : : The school nurse at Hijirigasaka Academy. She is aware of the supernatural things happening around the students and tends to give Basara advice. A wise and caring person, it is revealed that she was Basara's mother's best friend, and they were close enough to be sisters in all but blood. After Basara's mother dies, Hasegawa dedicates her life to protecting Basara. It is also revealed that she is not human but in fact a god, hinting that Basara's mother was one as well, therefore making him a Demigod. She later falls in love with Basara‚Äôs and enters into a secret relationship with him. At the end of the series, she becomes pregnant with Basara‚Äôs child. ; : : A member of the Hero Tribe who is released from prison to accompany Takashi and Kurumi as a spectator. While very powerful, he respects Basara's ability and desire to protect Mio, Maria, and Yuki. Basara states that he is so powerful that if he is a genius then Shiba is over-talented. ; : : The Demon who killed Mio's adoptive parents and Zest's former master, and who plans to turn on Leohart and obtain the Demon King's powers for himself by kidnapping Mio without Leohart's knowledge. After he is defeated, Lars captures, tortures, and finally kills him in the presence of Basara. ; : : The current Demon Lord and younger brother of the demon Riara. ; : : A teacher at Hijirigasaka Academy. Initially assumed to be a human, it is revealed that he is actually a god like Hasegawa. He is intent on killing Basara, who he believes reached beyond his stature through earning Hasegawa's affection, and believes that killing him will bring Hasegawa back to heaven. After using Kurumi as a hostage to prevent Basara from attacking, he then succeeds in cutting off Basara's sword arm. However, this causes the sword to react and release the spirit of Brynhildr, one of the most powerful Valkyries. In this form Basara's arm grows back, his hair changes color and his right eye glows. He moves so fast that Sakasaki cannot even see him, and he cuts off the top of his foot using Banishing Shift, which he could earlier only use as a counter, not as an attack. Basara attempts to kill Sakasaki but Hasegawa intervenes. She then reveals that she always knew that Ornis has replaced the real Sakasaki. Using her full power, Hasegawa kills Ornis and has Basara take the credit for killing the god.

Not being a simple initialism seems to have confused even Intel's technical writers as can be seen in their iAPX-88 Book where the asterisked expansion shows iAPX to mean Intel Advanced Processor System.Intel iAPX 88 Book (page i) The iAPX prefix originally belonged to the Intel iAPX 432 architecture, alias Intel 8800. However, as this radical design failed in the marketplace, Intel also tried it on its more conventional 8086-family of processors, mainly used as a kind of system prefix but also to denote individual processors in the family. The 8086 based line was therefore called the iAPX 86 series for a few years during the early 1980s. This was abandoned rather soon, however. The industry around the 8088- and 80286-based de facto standard of IBM PC and IBM AT designs also seldom used that naming scheme. As a result, the iAPX prefix is now, again, more closely associated with the (non-x86) iAPX 432 architecture (which, although a commercial failure, is often seen as historically important).

The bill also would authorize appropriations totaling about $17.5 billion, primarily for ongoing USCG operations over the 2015-2016 period. The Act was introduced during the 113th United States Congress, passed the Senate and House on December 10, 2014, and was signed into law on December 18, 2014. Related bills from the U.S. House of Representatives include and . Background The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's eight uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. To date, this has happened twice, in 1917 and 1941, during World War I and World War II, respectively. Today, the United States Coast Guard carries out three basic roles, which are further subdivided into eleven statutory missions. The three roles are Maritime safety, Maritime security, and Maritime stewardship. The Coast Guard has eleven statutory missions, defined by law, that are divided into homeland security missions and non-homeland security (or legacy) missions. The Coast Guard's legacy missions include: Marine safety, search and rescue, aids to navigation, living marine resources (fisheries law enforcement), marine environmental protection, and ice operations. The Coast Guard's Homeland security missions include: Ports, waterways, and coastal security (PWCS); drug interdiction; migrant interdiction; defense readiness; and other law enforcement. Provisions of the act A summary of provisions of the Act is available on the Congress.gov website. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on February 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Act amended the laws that govern the activities of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). The bill also would authorize appropriations totaling about $17.5 billion, primarily for ongoing USCG operations over the 2015-2016 period, and would increase the amount of food aid required to be shipped on vessels registered in the United States. Assuming appropriation of the specified and necessary amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $16.8 billion over the 2015-2019 period. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The Act contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 6, 2014 by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R, CA-50). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. On March 25, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-384. Debate and discussion Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA) spoke in favor of the bill, describing it as a bill that \\"ensures the men and women of the Coast Guard have the tools they need to carry out their critical missions, enforce our laws on U.S. waters and on the high seas, and safeguard our Nation's maritime interests around the world.\\" Rep. Duncan Hunter was also in favor of the bill, saying that the bill \\"improves the effectiveness of Coast Guard missions by reducing inefficient operations and enhancing oversight, places the Coast Guard's major systems acquisition program on a sustainable track, and encourages job growth in the U.S. maritime industry by cutting regulatory burdens on job creation.\\" Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) testified in favor of the bill because it would \\"remove the requirement that Valley View Ferry captains be licensed through the Coast Guard, and instead allow the state to implement its own licensing requirement.\\" At present, the local ferry has had to cut back on hours because the ferry has been unable to find a new captain for ferry due to the stringent Coast Guard requirements to get a merchant mariner license, despite the fact that the ferry only travels 500 feet on steel cables, without any steering capabilities. If the bill were to pass, the state government would be able to lower the licensing requirement for such a small ferry with only limited capabilities.

The Catlin Seaview Survey, later renamed the XL Catlin Seaview Survey, was a major scientific expedition which commenced in September 2012, whose aim was to document the composition and health of coral reefs worldwide. Specifically, the survey aimed to \\"carry out a rapid assessment of the current state of coral reef systems and to make this scientific record publicly available for scientists worldwide to use\\". The survey was sponsored by the Catlin Group until the survey ended when the Catlin group ended sponsorship. The original team created a film, chasing coral and a new, global initiative known as 50 reefs. History The survey started in September 2012, and was focused on sections of the Great Barrier Reef across a range of depths. Specifically, 32 reefs were sampled, which equated to approximately of reef. This produced around 105,000 images, which are currently being analysed by scientists globally, using image recognition software. In addition to imaging shallow reefs, the deeper reef was sampled. This also led to the discovery of the deepest known coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located at a depth of . This initial success led to the continuation of the survey globally. In 2013, the survey focussed on sampling corals in the Caribbean sea and Bermuda. Other sites are also being explored in 2014. Surveying The Seaview SVII Camera, used extensively throughout the Catlin Seaview Survey. The status of surveyed reefs is being documented using high-resolution, 360-degree panoramic vision. These images are GPS-tagged with camera direction recorded, documenting precise locations. This method of documentation is intended to form a visual record of the world's reefs, allowing different reefs to be visually compared, and individual reefs to be monitored over time. This imaging also aims to help both the general public and specific groups (e.g. policy makers) better identify and understand the threats facing coral reefs. Likewise, these images are intended to assist the formation of strategies to protect reefs. To survey deeper reefs, specialist divers and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROUVs) are being utilised. The temperatures of these deep reefs are also being monitored. In addition, biological samples are being collected to identify potential genetic links between shallow and deep coral systems, which could be important for conservation. Pulsed Amplitude Modulated (PAM) stress detection devices are also being used in deeper reefs to monitor stress levels. Much of this imaging was produced using the SVII Camera. The SVII is a self-propelling underwater panoramic camera, and was designed by the survey team. The camera can be controlled by a diver, and is propelled at a constant speed. The Seaview SVII-S has also been designed, and is a lighter, human- propelled version of the SVII which can be transported by a single person. Underwater tablets are used to control the cameras and observe real-time images, and have also been used for communication, especially with social media. As mentioned, ROUVs are used to sample deeper reefs. These are highly mobile, and can operate at low depths. These ROUVs also contain scientific equipment which can be altered depending on the sampling being carried out, and can carry out sampling. As with the low-depth cameras, these ROUVs are able to produce high definition geo-positioned images. Catlin Global Reef Record Data from the Catlin Seaview Survey has been used to construct the Catlin Global Reef Record, which was launched in 2013. This database contains images and data collected by the Catlin Seaview Survey and by other coral reef research. However, the huge photographic records generated by the Catlin Seaview Survey are the main aspect of this record. The Catlin Global Reef Record is freely available to scientists globally, and can be used to analyse these reef environments and monitor their change.

Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 A wall sloping in the opposite direction is said to overhang.Whitney, William Dwight. \\"Batter 2.\\" The Century Dictionary. New York: Century, 1889. 476-77. Print.  Uses  The term is used with buildings and non-building structures to identify when a wall or element is intentionally built with an inward slope. A battered corner is an architectural feature using batters. A batter is sometimes used in foundations, retaining walls, dry stone walls, dams, lighthouses, and fortifications. Other terms that may be used to describe battered walls are \\"tapered\\" and \\"flared\\". Typically in a battered wall, the taper provides a wide base to carry the weight of the wall above, with the top gradually resulting in the thinnest part as to ease the weight of wall below. The batter angle is typically described as a ratio of the offset and height or a degree angle that is dependent on the building materials and application. For example, typical dry-stone construction of retaining walls utilizes a 1:6 ratio, that is for every 1 inch that the wall steps back, it increases 6 inches in height.  Historical uses  Walls may be battered to provide structural strength or for decorative reasons. In military architecture, they made walls harder to undermine or tunnel, and provided some defense against artillery, especially early siege engine projectiles and cannon, where the energy of the projectile might be largely deflected, on the same principle as modern sloped armor. Siege towers could not be pushed next to the top of a strongly battered wall. Types of fortification using batters included the talus and glacis.  Regional examples  = Asia = Architectural styles that often include battered walls as a stylistic feature include Indo-Islamic architecture, where it was used in many tombs and some mosques, as well as many forts in India. Tughlaqabad Fort in Delhi is a good example, built by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, whose tomb opposite the fort (illustrated above) also has a strong batter. In Hindu temple architecture, the walls of the large Gopurams of South India are usually battered, often with a slight concave curve. In the Himalayan region, battered walls are one of the typifying characteristics of traditional Tibetan architecture. With minimal foreign influence over the centuries, the region's use of battered walls are considered to be an indigenous creation and part of Tibet's vernacular architecture. This style of batter wall architecture was the preferred style of construction for much of Inner-Asia, and has been used from Nepal to Siberia. The 13-story Potala Palace in Lhasa, is one of the best known examples of this style and was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. =Middle East= Battered walls are a common architectural feature found in Ancient Egyptian architecture. Usually constructed from mud brick for residential applications, limestone, sandstone, or granite was used mainly in the construction of temples and tombs. In terms of monumental architecture, the Giza pyramid complex in Cairo utilized different grades of battered walls to achieve great heights with relative stability. The Pyramid of Djoser is an archeological remain in the Saqqara necropolis, northwest of the city of Memphis that is a quintessential example of battered walls used in sequence to produce a step pyramid. =New World= In the Americas, battered walls are seen as a fairly common aspect of Mission style architecture, where Spanish design was hybridized with Native American adobe building techniques. As exemplified by the San Estevan del Rey Mission Church in Acoma, New Mexico, c.1629-42, the heights desired by Spanish Catholic Mission design was achieved through battering adobe bricks to achieve structural stability.

He co-directed The Last Survivor, which was a MIPCOM pick for 2010 and Web, which premiered at the DOC NYC Film Festival where it won the Sundance Now Audience Award. Life Kleiman was born in Long Island, NY. He became attracted to cinema as a child, especially after seeing Macaulay Culkin‚Äôs performance in Home Alone, then regularly imitated scenes from that movie (especially Keven McAllister‚Äôs scene, applying aftershave and screaming into the mirror) as well as scenes from My Cousin Vinny and The Fugitive, in part because it was the only time he was allowed to curse. This interest led him to making his own films in middle school and into high school. Kleiman received a Fulbright Scholarship and studied film theory, history and criticism at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 2006. He discovered documentary making at college, seeing it as a way to combine his love for cinema with a desire to promote social change, working on a series of documentaries highlighting the work of the College Board and the Gates Foundation in public education reform. He received a masters of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, with the aim of learning how policy is created and evaluated to relate this to filmmaking. Film career Kleiman‚Äôs film career initially began with stints at the documentary department at HBO, working with filmmakers Andrew Bujalski and Albert Maysles as an editor and crew member. In 2009 he worked in the editorial department at Beeswax as a post-production assistant. Shortly after graduation from the University of Pennsylvania, he teamed up with classmate Michael Pertnoy to found Righteous Pictures, dedicated to creating films with a progressive social agenda. Films with this organization include the documentary The Last Survivor in 2010, which he co-directed and co-edited. The Last Survivor is about survivors of genocides such as the Holocaust, Rwanda, Darfur and the Congo, and was a MIPCOM pick for 2010. Kleiman‚Äôs second documentary feature is called Web, (2013) which he directed, co-edited and co-produced. The idea for ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù came after reading Robert Wright‚Äôs book Nonzero, a speech by Bill Clinton on interdependence and learning about the One Laptop per Child program. Taking four years to make with government and private financing, the film premiered at the DOC NYC Film Festival in 2013. The documentary follows several Peruvian families as they gain computer and Internet access for the first time through the One Laptop per Child program as well as interviews with people such as author Clay Shirky, wikipedia‚Äôs Jimmy Wales, Dennis Crowley of Foursquare, Scott Heiferman of Meetup and One Laptop founder Nicholas Negroponte . Kleiman spent ten months living in Peru, dividing his time in the towns of Antuyo in the mountains and Palestina in the Amazon rainforest . Web won the Sundance Now Audience Award at the 2013 DOC NYC Film Festival. Artistry Kleiman considers himself as a film nerd/snob. He believes that documentaries, like any other kind of film, needs to tell a good story. Documentaries involve real people, which he believes is a plus in audience engagement.

It is found in shallow water in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Ocean where it tunnels into wood and attacks and destroys submerged wooden structures. Description Limnoria lignorum grows to a maximum length of but a more usual size range is . It is a yellowish colour and is about three times as long as it is broad. It has a woodlouse-like body with fourteen segments. It bores its way into wood to a depth of about . Distribution Limnoria lignorum is found in the boreal and temperate seas of the northern Atlantic Ocean and North Sea and it is also known from the west coast of North America. Its range extends from Norway southwards to France, and from the Gulf of St Lawrence southwards to Cobscook Bay and Cape Cod. Its depth range is from the littoral zone to a depth of about It is unclear from exactly where it originated because it has spread widely, aided in its dispersal by tunnelling into the hulls of wooden ships and inside floating driftwood. It was first described by the German zoologist Martin Rathke in 1799 from a location is Norway. Biology Gribbles tunnelling Limnoria lignorum is a wood borer and in favourable conditions can be present in large numbers, with densities of as many as four hundred individuals per of wood. The isopods are very small and the damage is at first confined to near the surface of the wood. The tunnels are about in diameter and usually follow the line of less-lignified material. As the upper layer of wood crumbles away under this onslaught, deeper parts of the timber are attacked and in time, pilings and other wooden structures are eaten away. Limnoria lignorum ingest wood fragments as they burrow. They do not seem to house bacteria in their gut that are able to digest lignin, as is the case in some other wood-boring species, and seem to rely on their cellulolytic enzymes to digest cellulose. They may also feed on fungal hyphae directly or may consume them indirectly in wood that is already softened as a result of attack by fungi and bacteria. The enzymes it produces to break up wood into sugars which it can digest are being investigated for producing biofuel. The eggs of Limnoria lignorum are retained by the female in the brood pouch under her thorax. The eggs hatch directly into mancae, juveniles that are miniature versions of the adult, which means there is no free-living larval stage to aid dispersal of this species. It has been shown that the water temperature influences reproductive processes. Little tunnelling or reproduction takes place during the winter but activity starts earlier in the year and continues later, and the young develop more rapidly under the warmer conditions that exist near the exit of a water cooling system. Effect on piers It has been known to damage wooden piles in piers, something first observed in 1810 by Robert Stevenson in the timbers he used in constructing the Bell Rock Lighthouse. In 1830 the Trinity Chain Pier had to be almost completely rebuilt after attack from the organism. The use of creosote does not protect wood against it.

The series follows Baird and Clark as they purchase foreclosed houses at auction, remodel the homes and sell them for return profits. Early life Doug Clark was raised in Murray, Utah and went to college at the University of Utah. In 1997 he received a bachelor's degree in economics Magna Cum Laude, and became an airline pilot for Colgan Air. While there, he was both a first officer and pilot, and in 2004 he became a captain for SkyWest Airlines. On his days off, he developed an interest in real estate investment. He bought his first home at an auction, and resold it within three days. Clark continued to work as an airline pilot until 2011. Real estate Clark met with Mike Baird in 2004 to learn how to enter the property flipping industry, and shadowed Baird until 2005 when they formed Equity Capital Group and Clark Venture Capital together. The business of the companies was to finance their buying, renovating, and then reselling homes purchased at auction. By late 2011 Clark had bought and sold 750 houses over five years in the Salt Lake City area, and by 2012 he had bought and sold one thousand. Clark has said that he only buys a small fraction of the homes he researches when looking for properties to invest in, and that the purchase price is the most important thing he looks at when making a decision on an investment. He has also been interviewed by the media regarding the best methods of house flipping and the differences between varying markets for property investments. He has also toured US home shows to give speeches about his business and has been interviewed about the logistics of purchasing homes at auction in regards to his television series. Reality television In 2009 Clark and Baird began working with television producer Danny Thompson to create a web series called Foreclosure Boys. The series involved the creation of about 90 YouTube videos per year about their business and different projects they would encounter. David Broome saw the videos and approached Clark and Baird about developing a reality television series surrounding their business. In 2011 Clark and Baird began producing and starring in the reality television series Flip Men on Spike TV, which focused on the restoring of houses abandoned during the housing crash‚Äîin particular, the more extreme cases of property degradation in comparison to the rehabbed result are shown. The show debuted on October 25, 2011, featuring properties in Salt Lake City.

The film takes a critical look at the lives of Benedict \\"hyhy\\" Lim, Danil \\"Dendi\\" Ishutin and Clinton \\"Fear\\" Loomis, three professional Defense of the Ancients (DotA) players who participated in the first International, the most lucrative esports tournament at the time. The central focus of the film is how their commitment to DotA had affected their lives and how this debut tournament for the sequel, Dota 2, would bring more meaning to their struggles. Synopsis The documentary focuses on three different players who arrive in Cologne, Germany, to compete in an esports tournament for Dota 2, The International, that will net the winning team a 1 million prize. Singaporean team Scythe Gaming is led by Benedict \\"hyhy\\" Lim. Parts of the film explore his life in Singapore, where he lives with his mother, aunt, and father. His father works long hours for a shipping company at the nearby port to support the family, and his mother and aunt disapprove of the time he spends on video games, which has led his grades to suffer. In order to attend The International, Hyhy must skip his final exams at school, and he feels that only winning the $1 million grand prize will demonstrate to his family that his gaming career is worthy of respect. He also admits that he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, and hopes that a win at the International will impress her enough for her to give him a second chance. Meanwhile, Clinton \\"Fear\\" Loomis, an American player from Medford, Oregon, is older than the other contestants, but he leads multinational team Online Kingdom in the hopes that he can finally prove that his life is going somewhere. Fear grew up under the care of his single mother, who eventually came to respect his skill at video games. As a young man in his 20s, Fear has found it difficult to support himself financially as a full-time gamer, being forced to play his matches on an old, secondhand CRT monitor. Finally, Danil \\"Dendi\\" Ishutin of Ukrainian team Na'Vi uses Dota 2 to cope with the tragic death of his father. Dendi's mother reveals that Dendi and his father were very close and would often go fishing together. Since his father's unexpected death from cancer, Dendi has never again gone fishing and has instead thrown himself into his gaming career. During the first stage of the competition, Online Kingdom, considered to be an underdog team, surprises onlookers by placing first in their group. Another group includes both Na\`Vi and Scythe Gaming, who place first and third, respectively. In the playoffs, Online Kingdom end their run with losses to Chinese team Invictus Gaming and Russian team Moscow Five, and take home $25,000 as the 7th place team. The strongest teams remaining are Scythe, Na'Vi, and EHome, a well-disciplined Chinese team. Scythe manages to defeat EHome, but loses to Na\`Vi and is then eliminated in the lower bracket finals in a rematch with EHome. In the best-of-five championship series between EHome and Na\`Vi, EHome manage to hand Na\`Vi their first loss of the tournament, but in the end Dendi, an unpredictable but highly skilled playmaker, leads his team to victory and Na\`Vi takes home the grand prize of $1 million. Hyhy's team, Scythe Gaming, takes home $150,000 as the third-place finisher. Despite not winning the first place prize, Hyhy is ultimately successful in convincing his girlfriend to get back together with him. Fear finally buys a new computer with his share of the prize and moves in with his teammates. Dendi, with newfound peace of mind, goes fishing for the first time since the death of his father. Reception Free to Play was generally well received by critics. Chris Zele of Maximum PC magazine, who was unfamiliar with the Dota franchise upon viewing the film, called Free to Play not only one of the best video game documentaries, but documentaries about any topic that he had ever seen. Philippa Warr of Wired magazine praised the film for drawing parallels between competitive video gaming and other sporting activities, while also noting that the film runs the risk of not connecting in certain areas, as in-game knowledge may be necessary for comprehending battle scenes. Brian Albert of IGN gave similar praise for being emotionally engaging and with a great deal of variety, while also criticizing it for failing to explain more intricate details about Dota 2 for those who may be unfamiliar with the game.

Life Born at New Ross, County Wexford, 5 February 1772, he was son of Humphrey Lloyd, himself the son of the Rev. Bartholomew Lloyd of the Abbey House of New Ross. His father died while he was still a boy, and an uncle, the Rev. John Lloyd, rector of Ferns and Kilbride, to whose care he had been given, also died shortly, so that he was left to struggle for himself. He entered Trinity College Dublin, in 1787 as a pensioner. In 1790 he was elected a Scholar of the College, in 1792 graduated B.A., and in 1796 obtained a junior fellowship. He graduated M.A. in the same year, B.D. in 1805, and D.D. in 1808.

Probably built sometime between 1798 and 1806, the house is notable for the well-preserved and conserved stencilwork of the itinerant 19th-century folk artist Moses Eaton. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Jewett- Kemp-Marlens House stands in what is now a remote rural location, at the effective end of North Road, an unpaved road that was once a main road between Keene and Acworth. It is a 1-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and large central chimney. The front roof face is pierced by two gabled dormers, and the center entrance is flanked by sidelight windows. A single-story ell extends to the left of the main block. The house was probably built sometime between 1798 and 1803, and was definitely standing by 1806. The building was restored in 1996, principally to conserve the artwork of Moses Eaton, an itinerant folk art stenciler, that is on its walls. The stencilwork was probably applied not long after the house's construction, and was protected from damage by alterations in the 1860s that doubled the thickness of the walls as protection against the severe weather conditions that sometimes afflict the area. Although this caused some damage to this artwork, the five walls that have been stenciled are among the best preserved of Eaton's work. Their attribution to the elder Moses Eaton is significant, as much of the known Eaton stencilwork is attributed to his son, who would have been seven in 1806.

Dantzler, Jr., to join the company, and the three incorporated the L.N. Dantzler Lumber Company on March 1, 1888.Charter of Incorporation of the L.N. Dantzler Lumber Company Retrieved 2014-03-15 The lumber company became the first privately chartered corporation in Mississippi. For 20 years, the company relied on contract loggers to supply their sawmills, but in the 1890s, the company began buying large tracts of land to insure a more reliable source of timber. By the early 1900s, the company had acquired about of timberland in the six southernmost counties of Mississippi. Mississippi Department of Archives and History Interview with A.M.

Dantzler Lumber Company sawmill at Moss Point, Mississippi (1909), courtesy of Special Collections Department, Mississippi State University LibrariesThe sawmill's Moss Point location was well situated for receiving logs that were rafted down the Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers and their tributaries. But in order to access their inland timber-holdings, the company built a railroad from Vancleave, Mississippi, northwest into what would become Stone County. Processed lumber from their sawmills was transported by rail, then loaded onto company ships for export through the Gulf of Mexico to Mexico, South America, the Caribbean Islands and Europe. By 1913, the company was the largest exporter of lumber in Mississippi. With the advent of World War I, demand for lumber from overseas countries declined as their economies shifted to the war effort. The company invested its profits from the Moss Point sawmill to purchase other existing sawmills and constructing new mills throughout south Mississippi. Their holdings once included the Bond Lumber Company (1915 to 1919), Cedar Lake Mill Company (1919 to 1927), Handsboro Lumber Company (1906 to 1914), Native Lumber Company (1899 to 1931), Ten Mile Lumber Company (1910 to 1922), and Vancleave Lumber Company (1903 to 1931).

The mill began operation in 1913 as Southern Paper Company. International Paper Company purchased the mill in 1928 and operated it through the end of the 20th century. The paper mill closed in 2001.Moss Point paper mill to close Retrieved 2014-09-05 Management practices shift As the supply of virgin timber declined in the 1920s, the Dantzler Lumber Company gradually ended its use of railroad logging. It began implementing reforestation on its cutover lands. By the early 1940s, the company had begun selectively cutting their timber to extend their reserve of larger trees. The company closed its Moss Point sawmill in 1942, and moved the company office to Ten Mile,Ten Mile, Mississippi Retrieved 2014-12-27 near Perkinston, Mississippi. There they opened a new sawmill. During World War II, Dantzler Lumber Company entered into a contract with the War Department to use labor from the prisoner-of-war camp in Saucier, Mississippi for stacking, loading, and handling lumber at their Ten Mile sawmill. In 1949, Dantzler Lumber Company ended all company-owned logging and mill operations, entered the business of tree farming, and began selling their timber on a selective basis so as to yield a variety of wood products: poles, pilings, sawlogs, and pulpwood. By mid-20th century, the company had reduced its timberland holdings from nearly half a million acres (200,000 hectares) to about . In 1966, the L.N.

Muslim women have come a long way; from not being allowed to work outside of being housewives all the way to becoming top achievers. There have and still are many misconceptions about Muslim women, such as that they need to be covered, they are not well- respected, or that they belong in the kitchen. Besides being a Muslim woman and that challenges that come with it, many of them had big parts in science and technology evolvements. These are the women who stepped up in their home countries, who have strict laws in general and became something of themselves.  Islam and science  Thousands of years ago, Muslims had a huge part with the advancement of science Almost the majority of misconceptions were all just misconceptions. Islam encourages that men and women are equal. The Islamic Holy Book, The Quran, instructs that Muslims should not just educate their sons, but as well at their daughters. Islamic history also involves very important women political leaders, who were all known for what they did. However, this does not mean that Muslim countries did not restrict women from advancing in their studies. Many Muslim countries were, and still are big on gender-based discrimination, because they believe it is a part of Islam, which is completely false. Proof of this could be the 750 verses from the Quran which state, \\"the quest for knowledge and science is obligatory upon every Muslim man and woman\\".  Anousheh Ansari  Anousheh Ansari Anousheh Ansari on September 18, 2006, a 40 year old woman, was the first female private space explorer. She was launched off from Kazakhstan in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft She migrated from Iran to America when she was about 17, in 1984. In 1993, her husband, Hamid Ansari and brother in law, Amir Ansari worked together and funded a company called Telecom Technologies Inc. Ansari received her bachelor's in computer and electrons engineering from George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia. Soon after, she completed her masters in Washington D.C at George Washington University. Anousheh spoke several different languages, such as Persian, French, English, and Russian - which she learned for her spaceflight.  Hayat Al Sindi  Hayal Sindi Hayat Al Sindi is a medical scientist in Saudi Arabia. She is also the first female among the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia's members. Her contributions were extremely good for biotechnology as well as medical testing. \\"My mission is to find simple, inexpensive ways to monitor health that are specifically designed for remote places and harsh conditions\\" Her test devices made sure to not require external power, electricity, etc. Sindi never spoke english or even travelled outside of Saudi Arabia, but she ended up moving to England to join a university. After learning English on her, she applied to Cambridge University for biotechnology and was the first female to be accepted into it. Sindi has since then shown a powerful message to other women and children. And let women know that they can transform societies if they wanted to.

When digital electronic computers appeared, they displaced all other kinds of computers, including analog computers and mechanical computers In computer science, a digital electronic computer is a computer machine which is both an electronic computer and a digital computer. Examples of a digital electronic computers include the IBM PC, the Apple Macintosh as well as modern smartphones. When computers that were both digital and electronic appeared, they displaced almost all other kinds of computers, but computation has historically been performed in various non-digital and non-electronic ways: the Lehmer sieve is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, while analog computers are examples of non-digital computers which can be electronic (with analog electronics), and mechanical computers are examples of non- electronic computers (which may be digital or not). An example of a computer which is both non-digital and non-electronic is the ancient Antikythera mechanism found in Greece. All kinds of computers, whether they are digital or analog, and electronic or non-electronic, can be Turing complete if they have sufficient memory. A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a programmable computer, a stored program computer, or a general purpose computer, since in essence a digital electronic computer can be built for one specific application and be non-reprogrammable. As of 2014, most personal computers and smartphones in people's homes that use multicore central processing units (such as AMD FX, Intel Core i7, or the multicore varieties of ARM-based chips) are also parallel computers using the MIMD (multiple instructions - multiple data) paradigm, a technology previously only used in digital electronic supercomputers. As of 2014, most digital electronic supercomputers are also cluster computers, a technology that can be used at home in the form of small Beowulf clusters. Parallel computation is also possible with non-digital or non-electronic computers. An example of a parallel computation system using the abacus would be a group of human computers using a number of abacus machines for computation and communicating using natural language. A digital computer can perform its operations in the decimal system, in binary, in ternary or in other numeral systems. As of 2019, all digital electronic computers commonly used, whether personal computers or supercomputers, are working in the binary number system and also use binary logic. A few ternary computers using ternary logic were built mainly in the Soviet Union as research projects. A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a transistorized computer: before the advent of the transistor, computers used vacuum tubes. The transistor enabled electronic computers to become much more powerful, and recent and future developments in digital electronics may enable humanity to build even more powerful electronic computers. One such possible development is the memristor. People living in the beginning of the 21st century use digital electronic computers for storing data, such as photos, music, documents, and for performing complex mathematical computations or for communication, commonly over a worldwide computer network called the internet which connects many of the world's computers. All these activities made possible by digital electronic computers could, in essence, be performed with non-digital or non-electronic computers if they were sufficiently powerful, but it was only the combination of electronics technology with digital computation in binary that enabled humanity to reach the computation power necessary for today's computing. Advances in quantum computing, DNA computing, optical computing or other technologies could lead to the development of more powerful computers in the future. Digital computers are inherently best described by discrete mathematics, while analog computers are most commonly associated with continuous mathematics. The philosophy of digital physics views the universe as being digital. Konrad Zuse wrote a book known as Rechnender Raum in which he described the whole universe as one all-encompassing computer.

It requires that all public bodies in England and Wales, including Local Authorities, and NHS organisations to consider how the services they commission and procure which are expected to cost more than the thresholds provided for in the Public Contracts Regulations might improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of the area. Third Sector organisations such as Social Enterprise UK pushed for the introduction of the legislation. In early drafts the Bill had a far greater focus on increasing public spending with social enterprises. The final text of the Act is focused on ensuring public spending leverages value in all three recognized domains or pillars of Sustainable Development, or the triple bottom line. Passage The Bill was presented to the House of Commons in 2010 by Chris White MP, the Member of Parliament for Warwick and Leamington as a Private Members' Bill. It received Royal Assent in March 2012. Effects Lord Young, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Adviser on Enterprise, conducted a review of the Act, which examined how the Act has been performing in its first 2 years.

The library building was a gift to the town from John Graves Shedd and Mary Roenna (Porter) Shedd, and is a Beaux Arts building built in 1910 to a design by William H. McLean and Albert H. Wright. Shedd also donated 2,000 books to the library, whose collection now exceeds 10,000 volumes. The library building, one of the finest of the period in the state, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Architecture The library stands in the village center of Alstead, on about on the west side of Main Street just south of the Cold River. It is a small but imposing masonry structure, built out of granite with Classical Revival details. It is symmetrical and basically rectangular in shape, with projecting pavilions at the centers of the front and rear facades, and a domed roof at its center. Large windows flank the front pavilion, which houses the main entrance in an elaborate surround with Ionic columns, pilasters, and an elaborate entablature and pedimented gable. The interior follows a typical plan for early 20th-century libraries, with an entry vestibule in the front pavilion, a central librarian's desk, and reading rooms to either side. The pavilion to the rear houses book stacks. The building's basement originally housed a small auditorium, which has been re-adapted for use as a children's collection and reading room. The library building was the gift of John Graves Shedd, chief executive of Marshall Field & Company and an Alstead native, and his wife Mary Roenna (Porter) Shedd, a native of Langdon, and was given in memory of their parents.

Argentina is home to the largest Chilean diaspora group. According to the Argentine 2010 census, there are 191.147 Chileans living in the country (born in Chilean territory). An estimate 2003-2004 estimated Chilean descendants, born in Argentina to a Chilean father or mother, in 190,000. Other figures, such as those by The World Factbook, show a total population (including those born in Chile and their descendants) of 429,708 people. Chilean immigration to Argentina dates back to colonial times. During the War of Independence of Chile, the period known as the Patria Vieja, ended with the defeat of the patriot forces at the Battle of Rancagua on October 1 and 2, 1814. The patriots who were crossing the Andes took refuge in the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata. Some of them returned to their country with the Army of the Andes in 1817 achieving restore the independence of Chile. Both countries share language, customs, history and one of the largest borders in the world, among other things.  History  Abrazo de Maip√∫ by Pedro Subercaseaux, which represents the respective founding fathers, Bernardo O'Higgins and Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. The migration process between the two countries dates back to colonial times. Undoubtedly, a memorable case was that of Chilean migration to Argentina after the Battle of Rancagua and the Spanish reconquest of Chile between 1814 and 1817. Since the late 19th century, there was a steady migration from the Chilo√© Archipelago to the southern provinces of Argentina, for use on sheep farms as industrial workers. Since then, they are an important part of the Chilean population resident in southern Argentina, to the point that the term \\"chilote\\" is a derogatory nickname for any Chilean. However, Chilean migration increased dramatically since the coup in 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat led by Augusto Pinochet. In this way, the peak of the Chilean migration to Argentina began, being able to see a notorious Chilean exile seeking refuge in the neighbouring country, after the Chilean military government initiated a wave of exiles opponents of the military regime, that joined the voluntary flight of many opponents, although this did not last long, as Argentina suffered a coup three years later. After the return of democracy in Chile in 1990, some citizens of that country have returned to their homeland, but others have definitely settled on Argentine soil, especially in the Patagonia region, where 53% live, exceeding 5% of total population of each province, and the region of Cuyo, where it is the 12% of the total population and where they have contributed in various ways, providing customs, food contributions, etc. The remaining 18% live in Buenos Aires.

Alibali & Mitchell J. Nathan \\"Embodiment in Mathematics Teaching and Learning: Evidence From Learners' and Teachers' Gestures (2011) Embodiment is an aspect of pattern recognition in all fields of human endeavor. Embodied design has an increasing role in mathematics education. Designers can use embodied cognition as a tool to study human behavior and create user-centered designs. Embodied design examines the meaning of abstractions, analyzing student reasoning and connecting mathematics to other subjects; for example, students can look at proportional relationships in a work of art. Learning strategies based on embodied design rely on motion and visualization; physical activity is helpful in learning a mathematical concept. When students are physically and mentally involved in learning, they retain content better. Recent theoretical advances such as Embodied Cognitive Load Theory have been suggested to harvest the potential advantages of embodied interaction modes for learning without filling up cognitive resources. Embodied design frequently includes trial-and- error learning. Embodied cognition is a tool designers can use to study \\"human behavior normally unobservable in order to create human-centric designs\\". For teachers, embodied design is planning experiences for students with lesson plans, curricula, activities and lessons. Mathematical manipulatives One aspect of embodied design is the use of manipulatives in learning. Manipulatives allow students to explore mathematical concepts by working with physical objects, linking their discoveries to abstractions. Although manipulatives are primarily used to illustrate modern elementary mathematics, educators use objects to represent abstract topics taught in high school, college and beyond.Michael Eisenberg ‚ÄúEmbodiment as a Strategy for Mathematics Education‚Äù (2009) A function of embodied design is to expand the use of manipulatives to foster the understanding of undergraduate abstract mathematics. One disadvantage of manipulatives is that students struggle to connect the physical activity to mathematical symbols and notation. Although manipulatives allow students to develop a deeper understanding of a concept, they need support to transfer that knowledge to algebraic representations.April Alexander & Larissa Co ‚ÄúTangible Digital Manipulatives for Math Learning‚Äù (2009) Although an influential theory in the field of instructional design, cognitive load theory, recommends designs involving lower levels of interactivity in order to save up cognitive resources for learning, the benefits of embodied interactions are evident. As a result, a synthesis, embodied cognitive load theory, has been proposed to aid in embodied design. In this model, embodied interactions are conducive to learning if the cognitive costs (such as motor coordination) are outweighed by their benefits (such as multimodal processing). Problem solving Another application of embodied design in mathematics education is its effect on problem solving and the development of critical-thinking skills. Throughout the problem-solving process students use objects to develop understanding, conveying understanding and meaning through gestures.Dor Abrahamson ‚ÄúHandling problems: embodied reasoning in situated mathematics‚Äù (2007) Problem solvers use gestures to connect their thoughts to the manipulatives with which they are familiar, and changing a manipulative's shape affects how a student connects with it and uses it to solve a problem. In a study by van Gog, Post, ten Napel and Deijkers, students performed better when they used simpler objects (such as colored discs) than when they used more-complicated objects (such as animal figures).Tamara van Gog, Lysanne S. Post, Robin J. ten Napel, & Lian Deijkers ‚ÄúEffect of Object‚Äôs ‚ÄòEmbodiment‚Äô on the Acquisition of Problem Solving Skills through Practice or Video-Based Modeling Example Study‚Äù (2013) Although problems can be as simple as what to wear or eat, their solutions are still a cognitive process. =With manipulatives= With embodied design, mathematics is not only about correct answers but the process of finding them. Students are asked to communicate the process (\\"road map\\") they took to arrive at an answer. Typical problem-solving questions, such as \\"What needs do you have? What is the problem you are posed with? How did you collect information? How did you come to your conclusion? How could you have optimized your steps to reach that conclusion?\\" can be answered with manipulatives. One aim of problem solving in embodied design is to inspire students' creativity and curiosity, allowing personal connections to problems. If students are given a problem which involves tactile manipulation, the learning process may be more meaningful. For example, students can learn to solve a Rubik's Cube puzzle by using a series of algorithms and steps. The process involves orientation, following directions and spatial cognition.Omar Arizpe, Jerry Dwyer, Tara Stevens ‚ÄúMathematical Self-Efficacy of Middle School Students Solving the Rubik Cube‚Äù (2009) Mathematical arts and crafts One approach to embodied design in mathematics is the use of creative tasks, such as arts and crafts. When a student has mathematics in mind while creating a unique piece, they are engaged in mental and physical learning. The concept of area can be taught with an arts-and-crafts activity, where students find leaves and trace them on paper; they are then asked to determine the number of beans (or peas) required to cover the entire leaf area. The class can then be asked which student had the largest (or smallest) leaf, and the areas can be compared.Robert E. Reys \\"Mathematics, multiple embodiment, and elementary teachers\\" (1972) Computer programming With game consoles such as the Wii and PlayStation Move, students can understand how moving a gaming wand can change the effects on the screen. Researchers who developing programs in mathematics use embodied design and gaming principles to help students create and manipulate mathematical models. At the Embodied Design Research Laboratory, researchers created a game in which fifth-graders learn ratios by holding tennis balls in the air. When the tennis balls are held at a 1:2 ratio, the screen turns green. Another embodied-design area related to programming is digital manipulatives. Some students feel weak in mathematics because it is not connected to the physical world, and digital manipulatives are being created to strengthen the connection between mathematics and the physical world.http://www.antle.iat.sfu.ca/CEIWorkshop/Papers/MathManipulatives_WorkshopPaper_IDC09_Eisenberg.pdf When students use a touchscreen with their fingers, they use gestures to create (or use) virtual objects in the program. Computers can model environments where the students imagine their bodies to be, and the mind behaves as it would on a playground. Cell phones, pads and computers provide mathematically-enhanced models everywhere, exploring everyday experiences and the curriculum in more-abstract ways.

Political Views  = Democratic Party/ removal from ballot = In May, the Tennessee Democratic Party‚Äôs State Executive Committee voted 41 to 18 to remove DeBerry from the Democratic primary ballot after 26 years in office. One of the committee members who voted to remove him said that DeBerry wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúexemplifying the basic Democratic principles.‚Äú DeBerry himself protested that it hadn't been the voters in his district that had taken him off the ballot rather, \\"A tribunal took me off the ballot that has absolutely nothing to do with my district.\\" = 2020 protests = On 1 August 2020 DeBerry, as Tennessee State Representative, delivered remarks on the floor of the Tennessee State Legislature during a debate with lawmakers on a law to increase penalties for demonstrators suspected of certain violent offences against police officers. During the debate, DeBerry gave a speech that had a large impact on social media. In the speech, DeBerry argued that the protests going on in the U.S at the time would be more successful if they remained peaceful. He spoke about rioters and demonstrators in Portland, Seattle and elsewhere in the U.S. and the negative impacts of them due to the destruction, violence, and property damage caused across the country. He argued that people did not have the right to destroy taxpayer-funded property. He recalled that his family had participated in civil rights activism in the mid-twentieth century and he personally witnessed the civil rights protests of the time. He also remembered that in his early life, he had to walk into public places through back doors, sit in the back of buses, drink out of the \\"colored\\" water fountain, and attend a racially segregated school because the law forced him to. He argued that the civil rights movement overcame these things because it had integrity and class, worked peacefully and had common sense and strong values.

It decrees \\"that in all Parliaments, Treatises and other Assemblies, which should be made in the Realm of England for ever, that every Man shall come without all Force and Armour\\". The statute, which was written in the Anglo-Norman language, goes on to assert the royal power to \\"defend Force of Armour, and all other Force against our Peace, at all Times when it shall please Us, and to punish them which shall do contrary.\\" It declares that \\"Prelates, Earls, Barons, and the Commonalty of our Realm... are bound to aid Us as their Sovereign Lord at all Seasons, when need shall be.\\" The statute was issued following a period of political turmoil in England which had culminated in the declaration of the Ordinances of 1311 ‚Äì a set of regulations imposed on the king by the English peerage and clergy to restrict his power. The role of the king's favourite, the relatively low-born Piers Gaveston, was a particular source of tension between Edward and his nobles. The barons forced Edward to send Gaveston into exile in a parliament held in April 1308, which they may have attended under arms. When Gaveston returned from his exile in Ireland in 1309, he further infuriated the kingdom's most senior nobles by treating them with contempt, giving them crude nicknames such as \\"Burstbelly\\" and \\"Whoreson\\". They refused to attend parliaments called for October 1309 and February 1310, citing Gaveston's presence as the reason. Edward sought to placate them on the latter occasion by sending Gaveston out of London and ordering the earls to come unarmed to parliament. Instead, they raised armed retinues which camped on the outskirts of London and presented themselves fully armed before the king, in open defiance of his edict. The outcome of the parliament was the creation of a council of nobles which eventually produced the Ordinances a year later. The Earls of Lancaster, Warwick and Hereford also attended the parliament of September 1312 fully armed. Edward's enactment of the 1313 statute represented at least his fifth attempt to rein in his nobles' tendency to use the threat of armed force as a means of bringing pressure at parliament. Similar prohibitions were also issued in October 1308, February 1310, October 1311 and August 1312. However, the statute does not seem to have resolved the problem at the time. The Earl of Lancaster defied the statute by attending the parliaments of February 1316, October 1318 and May 1319 under arms, and in June 1318 was accused by the king's council of attending parliaments \\"a force e armes\\". The law is still in force today, though the Crown Prosecution Service has said that it is unaware of anyone being prosecuted under this or other archaic statutes in recent times. According to a CPS spokeswoman, \\"If anyone was caught in the Houses of Parliament wearing armour it would first be a matter for the police.\\" References Category:Acts of the Parliament of England Category:1310s in law Category:1313 in England Category:Medieval English law Category:Medieval armour Category:Political history of medieval England ","title":"Statute forbidding Bearing of Armour"},{"id":"42250055","text":"The Igunga by-election was a by-election held for the Tanzanian parliamentary constituency of Igunga in Tabora Region.

Built about 1880 by the Cheshire Mill Company, it is a good example of period worker housing constructed by the company for itinerant workers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Acre is located south of the industrial village center of Harrisville, at the northeast corner of Main Street and Dublin Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its gable ends have short returns in the Greek Revival style, and there is an Italianate-style gabled wall dormer at the center of the main street-facing facade. That facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the main entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a portico with a low-pitch gabled roof, and is flanked by pilasters. The house was originally attached via a connecting ell to a barn; both of these structures have been removed, leaving a flushboard outline of the ell on the right wall. The house was built in 1879 or 1880 by the Cheshire Mill Company, the major operator of Harrisville's mills, for itinerant construction workers. Its name is taken from a trend in mill communities to name the mundane areas where such quarters were located as \\"The Acre\\". Local historical traditions state that the house was occupied by workers on the railroad link that brought the mill's products to market. The house is locally distinctive as an unusually late example of the Greek Revival, and for its unusual front gable.

The story is about Alice Pagett, a deaf-mute child who's cured one night when she runs to an oak tree behind St. Joseph's, her local church. She's found by reporter Gerry Fenn and, when news of her cure spreads, their village becomes ablaze with publicity. After Alice performs several \\"miracle\\" cures in front of the tree, and claims to have seen the Virgin Mary there, it starts to be treated as a Lourdes-like shrine by Catholic pilgrims. St. Joseph's priest, Father Hagan, however, senses spiritual danger.  Characters  *Alice Pagett, \\"miracle\\" healing child *Molly Pagett, Alice's mother, a devout Catholic *Len Pagett, Alice's father, an atheist *Gerry Fenn, an ambitious journalist *Father Hagan, troubled priest of St. Joseph's *Monsignor Delgard, paranormal investigator for the Catholic church *Bishop Caines, Hagan's superior *Sue Gates, Gerry's lover and fellow journalist *Nancy Shelbeck, American journalist  Style  Each chapter begins with a quote from a famous literary work, often a fairy tale or poem dealing with folklore, like the Grimms' canon, Peter Pan, and Hans Christian Andersen. The third-person narrative switches between several points of view, including village businessmen, Catholic officials, and other minor, as well as important, characters.  Film adaptation  On 3 December 2018, Deadline reported that Screen Gems and Sam Raimi will produce the adaptation of the novel with Evan Spiliotopoulos writing the script and making his directorial debut.

(William Bailey, Baily, or Bayly; died 1664) was Anglican clergyman who served in the Church of Ireland as Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh from 1644 to 1664. Early life and family Born in Scotland, he was named after his father, William Bailie, a native of Ayrshire., The Province of Connaught, p. 167., Bailieborough: A Pictorial Past, p. 12. He was educated at Glasgow University, but graduated with a Doctorate of Divinity from Oxford University. He and his family were driven out of Scotland by the Covenanters, and fled to Ireland, where his father was granted the lands of Toneregie (now Tandragee) in County Cavan by King James I in 1610., The Province of Connaught, pp. 167‚Äì168. His father had the construction of a fortified house, completed in 1613, and enclosed the demesne by 1629. The estate became known as the Manor of Bailieburrow, which was later known as Bailieborough. On the death of his father in , Dr Bailie inherited the estate. Ecclesiastical career From the Rolls of Chancery, 18‚Äì20 Charles I, it appears that Dr Bailie had been designed for the see of Kilmore, upon Bishop Bedell's death; for there is a revocation of several letters patent made to him, dated 3 March 1643-4., The Province of Connaught, p. 168. Instead, Dr Bailie was nominated Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh on 22 December 1643 and consecrated at Oxford on 2 May 1644 by James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, assisted by John Maxwell, Bishop of Killala and Achonry and Henry Leslie, Bishop of Down and Connor., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 383., A New History of Ireland, volume IX, p. 434. However, Bishop Bailie had little enjoyment of his see until after the monarchy was restored in Ireland in 1660. He died at Clonfert, County Galway on 11 August 1664, and was buried in Clonfert Cathedral.

Rasmussen, MD, FACS, Colonel, USAF MC, is a Professor of Surgery and Associate Dean or Research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and an attending vascular surgeon at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Colonel Rasmussen completed his medical degree at Mayo Medical School, surgical training at Wilford Hall Medical Center on Lackland Air Force Base, and vascular specialty training back at Mayo Clinic. Colonel Rasmussen was assigned to Andrews Air Force Base just before 9.11.2001 and soon after began caring for the injured returning rom Aghanistan at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He began a series of deployments to the Air Force Theater Hospital on Balad Air Base, Iraq, and Bagram Air Base and the Afghan National Army Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. During this time he initiated a research and innovation program aimed at developing a better understanding of vascular injury, hemorrhage control and shock as well as new approaches to managing these conditions. Colonel Rasmussen has led training missions in Morocco, Pakistan, and Russia, and his research efforts have resulted in hundreds of publications, including two textbooks, the Handbook of Patient Care in Vascular Disease and the 3rd edition of Rich's Vascular Trauma. He authored Vascular Injury Rates in the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in which he wrote that the frequency of vascular injury on the battlefield has increased by a factor of 5 between Vietnam and the current wars. Rasmussen was also one of the investigators in the Military Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Resuscitation Study (MATTERS) which was a collaboration with British researchers on the use of a drug called tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients with severe bleeding. The study indicated that patients treated with TXA survived twice as often as those who did not receive the drug. Colonel Rasmussen is a co-inventor of REBOA (resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta), which is a minimally invasive approach used to sustain blood pressure and control bleeding in severely injured and shocked patients. The ER-REBOA catheter of which he is a co-inventor has been used thousands of times in the U.S. and around the world and was featured in a 2017 New York Times article by Denise Grady. In 2019, Dr. Rasmussen led a team of military surgeons at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as the first in the Military Health System (MHS) to implant the Human Acellular Vessel, or HAV, into a patient who was in danger of losing his leg from vascular disease. Dr. Rasmussen had previously worked in support of the research and development of this bioengineered blood vessel which has significant potential to be used in the management of wartime vascular injury. In 2012, Colonel Rasmussen gave a TEDx talk on the transformation of military trauma care and its impact on medicine. He served as Deputy Commander of the Institute of Surgical Research from 2010 to 2013 and then moved to direct the larger DoD Combat Casualty Care Research Program at Fort Detrick, Maryland. His awards include the Gold Headed Cane for distinction in clinical and academic practice, the Baron Dominique Jean Larrey for Excellence in Military Surgery, and in 2015, he was recognized as a Hero in Medicine by the Center for Public-Private Partnerships. Dr. Rasmussen has contributed to articles published in USA TODAY, the Health Affairs blog and the New England Journal of Medicine. His June 2018 commentary entitled ‚ÄúActionable Information to Reduce the Burden of Non-battle Injury in Deployed US Service Members‚Äù was quoted by several news outlets including CNN.

It is native to the south western Indian Ocean. It was first described in 2010. Description Halichoeres zulu is characterized its naked head which has no small scales on the opercle or to the rear of the eye. In alcohol the colour of the female is pale tan with the scales on upper two-thirds of body, to the rear of the pectoral fins, have brown centres, while the scales below the soft part of the dorsal fin are dark brown, as are those in the lowermost scale row. There are three wide sooty bars on the chest and abdomen which fade towards the belly. The opercular flap has a black spot shaped like a quotation mark at upper end of gill slit and a dark brown spot of a similar size to the pupil is behind the upper part of the eye. The snout has an angled dark band with another over the cheek and the gill cover which is long and horseshoe-shaped band with dark edges. There are a oblique brown bands on the dorsal fin with a small black spot on between the first two spines and a black eye-spot between second and fourth dorsal fin rays. There are small dark spots on the rays of the rounded tail fin.The male shows a similar patterning, although most of the markings are darker than the females and there no black spot near the front of the dorsal fin and no oblique bands in spiny part of it. The male has a sinuous dark band at the base of anal fin with a wavy dusky band and a light spot at base of each membrane in that fin. Females are mainly pink or lavender-pink, in life, with narrow pale green bands and a bright red stripe on nape, this extends to the rear part of the dorsal fin. There is also a row of small, dark brown spots on the flanks above the anal fin. The males have deep pink and bright green bands on their heads and they have sinuous stripes of bright green and purplish red which alternate on their bodies. This species can reach in standard length. Distribution Halichoeres zulu ranges from the northern Transkei to Banganek which is just south of the mouth of Kosi Bay in northern KwaZulu Natal. It is expected that it will also be found in southern Mozambique. Habitat and biology Halichoeres zulu occurs solitarily at depths from along rocky shores, where there are patches of sand and coral. The shallow- water habitat off rocky shores in which this species is found are exposed to the wind and the waves, making it difficult to obtain specimens and this combined with its similarity to H. nebulosus, its rarity and elusive nature meant that it was previously overlooked. Taxonomy and naming Halichoeres zulu was described in 2010 by John Ernest Randall & Dennis R. King with the type locality given as Umhlanga Rocks in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The specific name refers to the Zulu people who are indigenous to KwaZulu-Natal. This rare species was formerly misidentified as Halichoeres nebulosus, and is a close relative of the Indo-Pacific Halichoeres margaritaceus.

It was established by author and critic Sheldon Warren Cheney. History Cheney established the magazine as a quarterly publication with the support of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts, which provided him with a workspace and financial support. The society's support proved short-lived. When the United States entered World War I, censorship of German art became common. Cheney criticized this practice in the magazine's August 1917 issue, leading the society to drop its support. Cheney responded by moving the magazine to New York City. Cheney served as the magazine's editor until 1921, with several co- editors being added as of volume three. With Cheney's departure, Edith J.R. Isaacs took over as the lead editor. In 1924, the name of the magazine changed to Theatre Arts Monthly, and its frequency of publication increased to match the new title. In 1939 the name was changed again to Theatre Arts. As an editor, Isaacs included arts such as music and dance in her view of \\"theatre\\". She supported the Little Theatre Movement and the establishment of the American National Theater and Academy. She publicized emerging artists, including Martha Graham, Robert Edmond Jones, Jo Mielziner, Donald Oenslager, Eugene O'Neill, and Thornton Wilder. In 1945 the magazine was purchased by Robert W. Dowling and Henry Steeger. Isaacs retired due to health issues in 1946, and Rosamond Gilder took over as editor. Across three years, Dowling and Steeger lost some $60,000. By the beginning of 1948, they were prepared to close the magazine down, but instead, they sold it to another publication, Stage, which merged with it, keeping the Theatre Arts name. Charles MacArthur became the editor. Byron Bentley took over as editor and publisher in 1962.

The 1994 sculpture stands tall and weighs , and was influenced by his visit to Southeast Asia one year prior. In 2010, Angkor I appeared in an exhibition of Kelly's work at the Portland Art Museum. In 2011, it was installed at Millennium Plaza Park on loan from the Portland-based Elizabeth Leach Gallery. The Arts Council of Lake Oswego began soliciting donations in 2013 in an attempt to keep the sculpture as part of the city's permanent public art collection, Gallery Without Walls. The fundraising campaign was successful; donations from more than 40 patrons, including major contributions from the Ford Family Foundation and the Oregon Arts Commission, made purchase of the sculpture possible. Angkor I has been called a \\"recognizable icon\\" and a \\"gateway\\" to the park's lake. Description and history Angkor I was designed by Lee Kelly, an Idaho-born Oregon sculptor whose works are influenced by modernism and abstract impressionism. Created in 1994, Angkor I is a large-scale stainless steel sculpture with a surface that is \\"gesturally and roughly finished\\". It stands tall and weighs . In Living in Sculpture: The Studio Work of Lee Kelly, Paul Sutinen writes that Angkor I, along with Angkor II and Phi Mai, were influenced by Kelly's 1993 visit to Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. His visit to the temple complex Angkor Wat inspired the sculpture, as evidenced by its plaque. In October 2010, Kelly moved the sculpture to the Portland Art Museum for his summation exhibit, which was open through January 2011. Later that year, the sculpture was installed at Millennium Plaza Park in Lake Oswego, on loan from Elizabeth Leach Gallery, the Portland-based company which represents Kelly. A board member for the Arts Council of Lake Oswego had initiated the loan proposal to Kelly and the gallery for this public display. According to Nancy Nye, executive director of the council, the sculpture is prominent in the park and \\"provides a gateway to the lake\\". =Permanent installation= Permanent plaque, 2014 In October 2013, Nye began soliciting donations for the purchase of Angkor I, which was scheduled to return to the gallery unless $55,000 could be raised by 5pm on November 1, 2013. Two weeks prior to this deadline, the council had raised $31,750, more than $20,000 short of the asking price. In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, \\"Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio is right here in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure.\\" She also wrote in a press release, \\"It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality\\". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying \\"We're more than halfway there, but what we really need is a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City's collection. And we need them now.\\" During the final two weeks of the fundraising campaign, the council draped a black parachute over the sculpture and posted signs requesting financial assistance, such as \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, this sculpture is leaving... Let's hope it's not.\\" On November 1, The Oregonian reported that the council's director was certain enough money had been raised to keep Angkor I in Lake Oswego permanently, as part of its Gallery Without Walls public art program, though the exact amount of funds raised was uncertain. The Arts Council of Lake Oswego confirmed the purchase via social media on November 5. Kelly and the Elizabeth Leach Gallery each donated $5,000, and the Ford Family Foundation and the Oregon Arts Commission had awarded a $10,000 matching grant in May 2013. All funding was provided by private businesses, foundations and individuals; none came from city or state funds. Portland Tribune and The Oregonian both published comments from Nye, in which she expressed delight about the addition to Lake Oswego's public art collection and providing access to the \\"fine\\" and \\"magnificent\\" work for future generations. The council planned a commemoration ceremony at the sculpture's permanent location; expected attendees were Kelly, Mayor Kent Studebaker, and members of the Ford Family Foundation and the Oregon Arts Commission. On November 7, sister publications Lake Oswego Review and Portland Tribune published a \\"reader's letter\\" written by Nye, in which she thanked the more than 40 funders who helped purchase Angkor I. Reception art ltd. magazine said Angkor I \\"reflective surfaces, ground in sweeping gestures, are as important as its form.\\" According to Nye, the sculpture \\"has become a recognizable icon\\". In her press release, which was published during her fundraising campaign, she wrote: \\"People often comment that its placement creates a gateway, or window to the lake. If Angkor I is removed, it will leave a real void in the landscape.\\" See also * 1994 in art * Cambodian art * List of public art in Lake Oswego, Oregon References External links * Category:1994 establishments in Oregon Category:1994 sculptures Category:Lake Oswego, Oregon Category:Outdoor sculptures in Oregon Category:Sculptures by Lee Kelly Category:Stainless steel sculptures in Oregon ","title":"Angkor I"},{"id":"42250730","text":"The Dr. Daniel Adams House is a historic house at 324 Main Street in Keene, New Hampshire. Built about 1795, it is a good example of transitional Federal- Greek Revival architecture, with a well documented history of alterations by its first owner. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Dr. Daniel Adams House is located south of downtown Keene, on the east side of Main Street at its junction with Gates Road. It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a front- facing gabled roof, four interior chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. It is predominantly Greek Revival in styling, with a five-bay front facade topped by a pedimented gable, in which there are two small sash windows. The front entry is sheltered by what was formerly a porch, but is now an enclosed vestibule with gabled roof. A two-story ell extends to the rear of the main block. There are significant surviving Federal-style details on the interior. The house was built about 1795 by Doctor Daniel Adams, a prominent local physician who also served as the town postmaster for a time. Adams undertook a number of alterations, restylings, and enlargements of the house prior to his death in 1830. His son, also a doctor, is probably responsible for the conversion of its original hip roof to the gabled one seen today. Its only major alteration since then was the addition of a bay window on the north side during the Victorian period, and the enclosing of the entry porch in the 20th century.

It was used during World War II as a training airfield by the 77th Flying Training Wing, Army Air Forces Central Flying Training Command. History =World War II= The first, and only, Conestoga 1620, prior to its launch from Wallops Island. The engine bells on the clustered boosters vary depending on their firing order; the larger bells are tuned for higher altitudes. The airfield was built during 1942 by the Army Air Corps, primarily to support the Matagorda Bombing Range. In addition it was also developed as a training school by Army Air Forces Training Command. Matagorda AAF was the home of the AAF Pilot School (Advanced Single Engine), and also conducted a Single-Engine Pilot Transition school. The major military units assigned were the 62d Single Engine Flying Training Group and 79th Bombardier Training Group.77th Flying Training Wing, lineage and history document Air Force Historical Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama Initially built with three runways, during the war two additional runways were added to accommodate the large number of landings and takeoffs. Aircraft assigned to the base were North American AT-6 Texans, Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, and North American P-51 Mustangs.www.accident-report.com: Matagorda Peninsula Bombing Range A series of curved roads on the east side of the parking ramp had dozens of buildings. After the war ended, the training school was inactivated and the facility was closed in November 1945. =Civil use= Destruction of the Conestoga 1620. Some motors remained propulsive after flight termination, and can be seen corkscrewing out of control. SSIA was purchased by EER Systems in December 1990. The design was modified again, this time using Castor engines like those used on the Scout, a workhorse of the 1960s. The new design was known as the Conestoga with a four-digit number following it indicating the arrangement of the boosters. Conestoga I prepared for launch After the war ended, the airfield was transferred to civil control, and was known as Matagorda Peninsula Airport. In the late 1940s, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics considered Matagorda Island as a rocket launch site, however, Cape Canaveral, Florida was chosen instead. However, in the 1980s, a private firm, Space Services Inc. established a rocket launch facility on the island for commercial rockets with the airport, known was Pierce Field, providing aircraft access. The airfield remained active until about 2002 when Space Services ended its use of Matagorda Island, and the airport was closed and abandoned. Today, the airport is closed and its facilities are deteriorating. Some old rocket launch stands can be found in the area. The World War II military base was dismantled and no longer remains.

Tennessee Legislature In 2012 and 2013, Hensley introduced a bill, nicknamed \\"Don't Say Gay\\", to ban schools from discussing LGBT issues; the bill eventually failed. For several years, Hensley cosponsored a bill allowing counselors and therapists \\"to refuse to counsel a client as to goals, outcomes, or behaviors that conflict with a sincerely held religious belief of the counselor or therapist,\\" such as LGBT clients. This bill was eventually passed and signed into law on April 27, 2016.

Dick Dowling Junior High School music teacher Eloise Rush Milam was asked to help arrange entertainment for a bond rally at the Jefferson Theatre in Beaumont. Milam also gave private voice lessons to junior high and high school-aged girls, so she presented her students as a choral group, all dressed in white. Since the newspaper insisted on having a name for the group, they decided to call themselves the Melody Maids. This first performance was on July 4, 1942. Touring Although they performed for many types of audiences, their decades of service to the military began that December, singing at Camp Polk (now Fort Polk), Louisiana. The Melody Maids began to travel from coast to coast singing for military bases, military hospitals, veterans and other civic organizations. They also recorded radio broadcasts. The group made four tours of Europe, several to England, three to the Far East, seven to the far North, four to the Caribbean, five to Mexico, seven to Hawaii, and four to Bermuda, Iceland, and the Azores. The girls financed some of the tours themselves by holding bake sales, silver teas, style shows and other fund-raisers. After 1956, all of the Melody Maid tours were financed by the Entertainment Branch of the Department of Defense (not to be confused with the United Service Organizations). Of all the performers who traveled with the Entertainment Branch, the Melody Maids were requested the most. Morals, manners and music The Melody Maids and Eloise Milam wore identical costumes. Their routines called for a variety of costume changes, depending on their location and the content of the show. The group had a book of rules for conduct and etiquette. This book, the Melody Maid \\"Bible,\\" taught them how to act when presented to royalty and the correct way to present themselves at formal affairs. Milam always said she taught the girls morals, manners, and music, in that order. In addition to performing at the bases, their visits often included dances at the officers clubs, state dinners with foreign dignitaries, and seeing historical and cultural sites as their schedule allowed. As the decades passed and the Melody Maids got more popular, competition was fierce for acceptance into the group. In later years, not only did the girls have to audition for Milam to get in the general Melody Maids, but had to further audition (behind a screen to even the playing field) for precious limited spots on the international tours. Being teenage girls, the tours were usually scheduled during winter breaks and summers in order not to conflict with their school attendance. The Melody Maids sang standards, popular songs from the Hit Parade, and Broadway showtunes. Often, their performances included medleys of patriotic songs and/or hymns. Milam made many of the arrangements herself. Milam's son and trumpetist Bucky Milam also appeared at many performances with the Melody Maids. Milam as director and composer: Song Saga of Spindletop To help celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of oil at Spindletop in 1901, Milam wrote a musical production, Song Saga of Spindletop. The work contained twelve original songs written by Milam to salute the oil industry of Beaumont. Songs include \\"My Man's a Roughneck\\", \\"Ladders to the Sky\\" and the dramatic \\"Texas\\". The first performance was on the anniversary (January 10, 1951) of the Lucas Gusher and was lauded by Gulf Oil Company. The Melody Maids appeared on the television show \\"We, the People\\" in 1952 to perform the musical. Legacy Following the death of her mother, Milam took a leave of absence from the Melody Maids. In 1972, Milam's husband, Mason Milam, retired from Mobil Oil. The anti-war movement and wide sociological-cultural changes had also impacted the Melody Maids ability to perform both domestically and internationally. The legacy of the Melody Maids has been a long-lasting one. Through the years there were around 1,500 Melody Maids, and the group received many domestic and international awards. Milam was the first female Texas Ranger (Honorary), and in 1961, was given the Distinguished Service Award by the American Legion, Post No. 33. The Melody Maids and Milam have an article in the Handbook of Texas Music, by Laurie E. Jasinski (published in 2012). Several former Melody Maids went on to have careers in the arts (as teachers and performers), but all were certainly taught self-pride, graciousness and to live lives of service. In an era where the lives and activities of teenage females were limited, Eloise Milam and the Melody Maids offered opportunities to travel to distant lands, learn fundraising and public relations skills, and gain experience in service. The Melody Maids had reunions, some with public performances in Beaumont, from 1977 to 2008. Many of the Melody Maids kept in touch and established a tax exempt Melody Maid Foundation, which sponsored a $10,000 scholarship fund at Lamar University. The rehearsal hall of the Melody Maids at the Milam home (called The Harmony Hut) served as the repository for all Melody Maid photographs, costumes and programs. The Quonset building (donated by the City of Beaumont) that was the Harmony Hut was a lightweight structure that began showing its age in the 1980s. Consequently, a new home for all things Melody Maid was needed, and at a museum setting was deemed most appropriate. The Eloise Milam‚ÄìMelody Maid Rose Room at the Julie Rogers Theater in Beaumont opened in 1990. Scrapbooks, souvenirs, photographs, and other memorabilia are housed there. The room is open to the public by request. In 2000 the Melody Maids performed Song Saga of Spindletop at their annual reunion as a tribute to Eloise Milam. Milam died on October 3, 2008, at the age of 100.

Her adoptive parents, Fred and Florence Goodman, named her Florence Marie Goodman. Marie Goodman Hunter in 2013 Early life Young Florence Marie attended public schools in Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. She discovered her innate musical ability when her parents took her as a child of six to a Palm Sunday ceremony at a family member's school. The festivities were to include a vocal recital, but the singer did not show up. Young Marie, thinking that singing was everyone's natural gift, volunteered to entertain. And she did. With no prior lessons, she sang the familiar hymn, \\"I Come to the Garden Alone\\"‚Äîto great acclaim.Tupponce, Joan, \\"Marie Goodman Hunter: A Lifetime on the Stage,\\" FiftyPlus, George Cruger, ed., Richmond VA, January 1999, 8 Years of lessons followed. She attended Armstrong High School in Richmond. At Virginia State University in Petersburg, she was certified as a music teacher. Her first teaching assignment was in 1950 at the Luther Foster High School in Blackstone VA. She next served as a member of a team of arts specialists who would visit Richmond schools in turn, to share their musical expertise with the regular teachers. She married Charles Hunter on August 28, 1954 (divorced in 1969). In 1966, they adopted their daughter, Kelley Allyson Hunter. Civil rights and civic behavior In 1962 Marie Goodman Hunter helped to break the color barrier as a member of the first contingent of African-American teachers assigned to Richmond's William Fox Elementary, a previously all-white school. From 1961 to her retirement in 1991, she taught at John Marshall High School. She continued her own education with studies at Columbia University's Teachers College, the University of Virginia, and the College of William and Mary. Although her main subjects were Music and Speech, Goodman Hunter took pride in teaching the highest standards of citizenship to her students and instilling in them a deep appreciation for the civic virtues of \\"manners and respect [and] personal hygiene.\\" She was enthusiastic and demanding in her love of music and her distinctly maternal nurturing of her choir \\"children.\\" Combining discipline with respect, she set rigorous standards, remembered by her daughter Kelley‚Äîwho was also her pupil for a time--\\"She demanded respect. She taught us how to carry ourselves and to know that when we step out in the world we should carry ourselves in the same way.\\"Hunter, Kelley, quoted in Tupponce, 9 Of her teaching style, Goodman Hunter says, \\"I was very blunt, very abrupt at times. But I did what it took to get the message across. I am proud of my teaching years. ...[M]y children were ... on the ball probably because I scared the hell out of most of them.\\"Tupponce, 9 She led her choir and the Marshall Singers to perform for local churches, community events, and for government officials.

As she became more and more used to public performance, she discovered that she also had a talent for acting. \\"An Actress Who Happens to be Black\\" For a black woman, theatrical opportunities were limited, but her combined singing and acting talents secured her place as the first African- American in the cast of The Common Glory, the annual patriotic pageant in Williamsburg VA,\\"Marie Hunter to Sing at Williamsburg,\\" The Afro-American, June 2, 1956 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2211&dat;=19560602&id;=FNUmAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=owIGAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3967,6089426 and she made early appearances at the Barter Theater in Abingdon and Swift Creek Mill Theater in Colonial Heights. Asked about the casting odds she faced, Goodman Hunter said, \\"I appreciate directors who hire you as an actress who happens to be black and not as a black actress.\\"Tupponce, 9 In the late 1950s and early ‚Äò60s, the top community theater in the state was the new Virginia Museum Theater (VMT, now known as the Leslie Cheek Theater), built within the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Goodman Hunter was among the first African-Americans to perform on the VMT stage,Under director Jimmy Dyas, as noted by George Cruger in FiftyPlus, 2 even while racial separation was the law of the land. During that era black actors were restricted to playing crowd extras or race-specific roles, usually as maids and other servants. In the late ‚Äò60s, in the aftermath of segregation, a new VMT director, Keith Fowler, cast her to play non-racial parts in several productions, including the controversial Marat/Sade, in which she played Cucurucu.Cast List page from Marat/Sade program, Oct., 1969 - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Marat_Sade_program.jpg When VMT attained full professional repertory status, Goodman Hunter was one of the local actors to be awarded an Equity contract, elevating her to professional rank in the VMT Rep company that included Ken Letner, E.G. Marshall, Alfred Drake, Janet Bell, Lynda Myles, and dramaturg M. Elizabeth Osborn. In 1974 she showed her acting, singing, and dancing abilities on the VMT stage as the Innkeeper's Wife in Man With a Load of Mischief.VMT Season Program, 1973-74, Title Page \\"Cast\\" Among major roles she played at VMT are Berenice in The Member of the Wedding, Missy in Purlie, Ginny Jenny in The Threepenny Opera, and Adelaide in Guys and Dolls.VMT Season Programs, 1972 through 1976 Goodman Hunter‚Äôs acting and musical skills won particular acclaim for her work as Adelaide.

Her reputation spread far beyond local theaters, as she reprised her role as Berenice in The Member of the Wedding at the Tanglewood Barn Theater in Winston-Salem NC and went on to perform leading roles at the McCarter Theater in Princeton NJ and at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. In 2002 and 2003, she starred in The Life and Songs of Muriel Smith in Caux, Switzerland. Continuing her work on Virginia stages, she appeared in a Tribute to Black Composers at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and played in Having Our Say‚Äîthe Delaney Sisters at Richmond's Theater IV.

These separate types of highways are respectively designated with an I-, US, or STH- (or WIS) prefix. The system also includes minor roads designated as Scenic Byways, four routes intended to promote tourism to scenic and historic areas of the state; and as Rustic Roads, lightly-traveled and often unpaved local roads which the state has deemed worthy of preservation and protection. The state highway system, altogether totaling across all of Wisconsin's 72 counties, is maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). Highway systems =Interstate and U.S. highways= The state of Wisconsin is served by eight Interstate Highways, consisting of five primary routes and three auxiliary routes. The first part of this system was constructed in 1956, and its most recent expansion took place in 2015, with the addition of I-41 to the system. Wisconsin's longest interstate highway is I-94, at 348 miles, and its shortest is I-535, which extends only 1.2 miles into the state. There are also fourteen United States Numbered Highways in the state of Wisconsin, which were designated beginning in 1926 and ending in the mid-1930s. The routes of the U.S. highway system in Wisconsin have remained essentially unchanged since U.S. Route 110 was downgraded to a state highway in 1939. There are also several business routes, usually maintained by local governments. =State trunk highways= The state of Wisconsin maintains 158 state trunk highways, ranging from two-lane rural roads to limited-access freeways. These highways are paid for by the state's Transportation Fund, which is considered unique among state highway funds because it is kept entirely separate from the general fund, therefore, revenues received from transportation services are required to be used on transportation. The majority of state highway funding comes from gas taxes and vehicle registration fees. =Other state highways= The Wisconsin Department of Transportation also develops and maintains some minor routes, under the designations of Scenic Byways and Rustic Roads. Scenic Byways are minor roads, typically two-laned, that travel through areas of \\"scenic and historic interest.\\" Rustic Roads are lightly-traveled local roads, sometimes paved and sometimes dirt or gravel, whose rustic characteristics are intentionally maintained and preserved by WisDOT. =Other highways in Wisconsin= All 72 counties in Wisconsin maintain their own system of county highways, which are usually small, have low levels of traffic, and terminate at the limits of cities and towns. Each highway is designated with a label of between one and three letters, and are usually named sequentially, starting with Highway A and continuing to Z, then using double letters from AA to ZZ, and using triple letters if necessary, although this is not a requirement and there are plenty of exceptions. The various cities, towns, and villages of the state each maintain their own roads beyond this, servicing individual homes and businesses and connecting them to the other systems, although these are not typically referred to as highways. There are also several types and systems of roads in Wisconsin that are not part of any state or local highway system, and are not specifically constructed or maintained by the state Department of Transportation or by any local agency. *link= Forest Highways are routes through National Forests, and are thus designated by the United States Forest Service. *link= The Kettle Moraine Scenic Drive is a marked route that follows county and local roads past historical markers and attractions in the Kettle Moraine. It extends between Whitewater and Elkhart Lake. *link=link= The Lake Michigan Circle Tour and the Lake Superior Circle Tour encircle Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, respectively. *link= Minnesota State Highway 23 passes through Wisconsin in Douglas County for about before returning to Minnesota. *link= The Yellowstone Trail was the first transcontinental automobile highway to be constructed through the upper tier of states in the United States. It was exempted from a state law banning privately-designated highways in 1917. History The many precursors to the state highway system predate the development of motorized vehicles by several decades, and the earliest even predate European settlement. For example, parts of the Native American trail connecting Green Bay to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, have now become US 41. In the early 19th century, wagon roads were created so that people and supplies could be transported from one settlement to another in days rather than weeks. Beginning in the 1830s, these routes were primarily improved and maintained by the United States military. These routes were gradually replaced by a decentralized network of both private plank roads and early territorial and state roads which, while created by the state government, were the responsibility of towns and villages to build and maintain. However, by the end of the 19th century, particularly before the popularization of the automobile, railroads became dominant and largely supplanted the state's roadways as means of long-distance transportation. In 1911, the Wisconsin Highway Commission was established as a central planning organization for the state's first motorized roadways. In 1917, the Commission began developing a standardized numbering system in response to the proliferation of privately marked highway systems, which used inefficient routes and were inconsistent. The state legislature made this practice illegal in 1917, in a law that also provided for the creation and marking of a state trunk highway system, that would be required to provide access to every county seat and all towns with a population over 5,000, and was limited to a total length of . The first signposts were erected in May 1918. Thus, Wisconsin became the first state in the country to officially mark and number its state highways. Wisconsin's first distinctive route marker (required by the 1917 legislation) was an inverted triangle. The triangle by itself was found in practice not to use space efficiently. The distinctive route marker was eventually redesigned and codified to be the union of an inverted triangle and a rounded rectangle in 1933; this shape remains in use today. The first U.S. Numbered Highways were established in Wisconsin in 1926, in many cases taking the place of highways the state had already established. As a result, the goals of the state highway system were expanded, aiming to reach every town with a population over 2,500 and relaxing its previous upper bound on network length. During the Great Depression, the state of Wisconsin launched a large number of public works projects in accordance with the New Deal, which led to massive expansions of the state system. By the end of the Depression, the system had approximately reached its current length. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s led the Wisconsin Highway Commission to begin developing other controlled-access freeways to complement the federal system. The focal point of this construction was in Milwaukee, where of freeways were planned, although the system's growth became a major point of contention and only half of the planned routes were built. Future In 1999, WisDOT began developing State Highway Plan 2020, which lays an outline for the further development and maintenance of the state highway system into the near future. The plan classifies the state's highways into five categories based on their importance to the successful functioning of the network as a whole: * Corridors 2020 backbone routes, consisting of the state's largest and most crucial routes: Interstates 39, 41, 43, 90, 94, U.S. Highways 10, 41, 51, 53, 151, and State Highway 29. * Corridors 2020 connector routes, consisting of routes that primarily serve to connect cities and areas to the backbones listed above: U.S. Highways 2, 8, 12, 14, 61, 63, and State Highways 13, 21, and 26. * Other principal arterials, routes that connect areas within a specific region, or serve as major routes within cities. * Minor arterials, which connect small towns and rural areas to larger routes and to each other. * Collectors and local function roads, the smallest and least-trafficked routes in the system.

It consists of two subspecies, the small yellow cockroach (Cariblatta lutea lutea), and the least yellow cockroach (Cariblatta lutea minima). The ootheca, or egg case, of C. lutea has been suggested as a possible host of an ensign wasp, Hyptia floridana. Subspecies There are two identified subspecies of Cariblatta lutea: Cariblatta lutea lutea (Saussure & Zehntner 1893) and Cariblatta lutea minima Hebard 1916. Habitat differences and the broad overlap in distribution of the two subspecies in peninsular Florida have prompted the suggestion that they may warrant recognition as distinct species. Description Cariblatta lutea lutea is a pale brownish-yellow, with a pale brown head, a band between the eyes, and usually some dark brown spots on the face. The disc of the pronotum (head shield) is usually marked with several small brownish spots, and its sides are transparent. The tegmina (leathery forewings) typically don't quite reach the apex of the abdomen. The tegmina of males are stinctly shorter than those of females, and the tips of the tegmina are rounded on females. The subgenital plate of the between the styles of the male is three times as long as it is broad. In females, the subjenital plate is large and boat-shaped with a rounded apex. Females of the subspecies tend to be larger than the males, with much shorter wings. Female body length ranges from compared to male body length from . Female pronotum length ranges from compared to male pronotum length from . Cariblatta lutea minima is on average smaller and has shorter tegmina than Cariblatta lutea lutea. Males of the C. l. minima subspecies also have shorter inner rudimentary wings, and a much narrower subgenital plate, than C. l. lutea. Males of C. l. minima are slightly smaller than females; the length of the body of males ranges from , and the length of the pronotum of males ranges from , while the body of females ranges from , and the pronotum of females ranges from . Etymology The genus Cariblatta was named after the Carib people of the Caribbean. Blatta means ‚Äúan insect who shuns light‚Äù in Latin, referring to cockroaches as well as moths and other insects. Lutea means yellow, saffron, if mud or clay, good for nothing in Latin. Words by William Whitaker lutea Distribution Cariblatta lutea lutea is found in the coastal plains of the southeastern USA including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, as well as the island nation of Cuba. Cariblatta lutea minima is documented only in Cuba and several counties of the state of Florida. Habitat Cariblatta lutea lutea is found in leaf, grass, and pine needle litter in forests in the southeastern US. In Florida it is commonly found in a variety of plant communities in Florida, and has also been found in gopher burrows, disturbed areas, and near houses. Cariblatta lutea minima is found in hardwood hammocks in southern peninsular Florida and in the Keys, in open pinelands in Dade County, and in a variety of scrub, flatwoods, and hammock plant communities in northeastern Florida. It has also been collected in Spartina marshes, and sawgrass marshes, and in grasses behind beaches.

Anthony of Colorado. Early years Ellis Meredith was born in Montana Territory in 1865 to Frederick Allison and Emily R. Sorin Meredith. Her mother graduated from Hamline University at Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1859 and received her master's degree in 1863. Her father was the editor of the Red Wing Republican when they were married. The Merediths were settlers of Bannack by the winter of 1862‚Äì1863 when they traveled by wagon to Bitterroot Valley in southwestern Montana. Ellis, her mother and brother, went to her grandfather's house in De Soto, Missouri, for some time.Meredith,Ellis; \\"Three Distinguished Figures of the Early Rocky Mountain News\\", Colorado Magazine, Vol. 27, No. 1, January, 1950. In 1885, she moved to Denver with her family, where her father was a printer and later managing editor of the Rocky Mountain News. Her mother was the first journalist in Denver when she began writing for the paper in 1886. She was also a suffragist. Career =Suffrage movement= In 1890 she and five other women founded the Colorado Non-Partisan Equal Suffrage Association. In 1893 she went to the Woman's Congress at the Chicago World's Fair in August 1893 to ask for help from Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone, leading suffrage activists, saying, \\"If Colorado goes for woman suffrage, you may count on a landslide in that direction throughout the west.\\" Susan B. Anthony agreed to send organizer Carrie Chapman Catt to help, and Meredith wrote to Anthony about the situation in Colorado while Carrie Chapman Catt traveled around Colorado organizing. =Journalist and author= She joined the Rocky Mountain News in 1893. She began writing the column A Woman's World for the Rocky Mountain News in 1889, where she (among other things) advocated women's suffrage. In 1894 she became part of the editorial staff of the Rocky Mountain News, where was the first female journalist in Colorado, and probably the United States, to cover the legislature.Ellis Meredith, Representative Women of Colorado, 1914Meredith also wrote three novels - The Master Knot of Human Fate (1901), Heart of My Heart (1904), and Under the Harrow (1907). =Politics= On November 7, 1893, the men of Colorado voted for women's suffrage and Meredith stayed involved in politics. In 1902, she helped write Denver's first city charter as one of only was four female delegates to the Denver City Charter convention. She was the vice chair of the Democratic Party State Central Committee from 1904 until 1908, and in February 1904 she became one of the people from Colorado to testify to the House of Representatives' Committee on the Judiciary in favor of the suffrage amendment. The first woman elected to office in Denver, she became City Election Commissioner in 1910 and served in that role until 1915. In 1917 she moved to Washington, D.C. to work at the National Democratic headquarters. Personal life Meredith was married in 1889 to Howard S. Stansbury and they divorced in 1901. She married Henry H. Clement in 1913. She moved to Washington, D.C. in 1917 to take a job with the Women's Bureau of the Democratic Party and continued to be an active member of the Woman's National Democratic Club. She died in 1955.

The firm, based on Pleck Road, was founded by James Bailey and became a limited company in October 1911 but had been issuing advertising material from at least March. Two models were produced both powered by J.A.P air-cooled V-twin engines with friction disc transmission and belt drive. The friction drive consisted of a vertical driven disc and a smaller wheel that could be moved across the face of the driven disc so the distance from the drive axis would give variable gearing. A clutch action was made by lifting the driven wheel off the drive disc. Moving the driven wheel past the centre gave a reverse gear. The smaller car with an engine rated for taxation at 5/6 hp had tandem seating with the driver sitting behind the passenger. The larger model had a 7/9 hp engine. By 1913 the tandem seating was replaced by more conventional side by side coachwork and windscreen. The engine had grown to 964 cc with a RAC horsepower rating of 8 hp. The belt drive was replaced by a shaft to the friction disc and chain to the back axle. The price was quoted as ¬£115. When Crescent Motors moved to Britannia Works, Rolfe Street, Smethwick, Birmingham, the J.A.P engine was replaced by a water-cooled Precision or a Blumfield V-twin engine. The final drive by chain was to only one of the rear wheels with the other driven by a friction plate so a differential was not needed. The only body style offered was a 2-seater open model, which sold for ‚Ç§127. The Crescent was popular with female motorists, with several registered in the West Midlands. Production ended in 1915, and only one Crescent is known to survive. The number made is not known.

A large number were built in the 1940s and '50s. Design and development thumb The Z-25 ≈†ohaj was designed to be a replacement for the pre-war, German Meise. The latter, designed for the glider competitions of the 1940 Olympics that were abandoned because of hostilities, was widely used in post-war Czechoslovakia. The two types had similar appearances and much in common but the ≈†ohaj significantly improved on the older aircraft by using 5-digit series NACA airfoils rather than the old G√∂ttingen 549; the NACA sections provide more lift at low speeds, improving flight in thermals and lower landing and take-off speeds. They also had a lower pitching moment and hence lower tail loads, allowing the structure to be lightened. The ≈†ohaj's wings were mounted around shoulder height on the ovoid cross section fuselage, enabling a smoother aerodynamic junction than on the Meise, which had a high wing on an almond shaped fuselage. The ≈†ohaj is an all wood framed aircraft, covered in a mixture of plywood and fabric. It has strongly straight tapered wings (taper ratio 0.28) with elliptical tips, built around a single spar. From the spar forward around the leading edge the wing is ply covered, forming a torsion resistant D-box. Behind the spar the wing is fabric covered except near the roots ahead of an internal, diagonal, drag strut. There is no sweep at one quarter chord and the wings are mounted with 3¬∞ of dihedral. Fabric covered ailerons fill about half the span, with airbrakes just inboard of them and immediately aft of the spar. On the early ≈†ohaj 1, first flown in 1947, these are of the DFS type like those on the Meise, opening above the wings. These are also fitted to the LG-125 ≈†ohaj 2 (sometimes written as Z-125) but the later VT-425 ≈†ohaj 3 or Super ≈†ohaj of 1955 has parallelogram action, double blade Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes. The ≈†ohaj 3 also had its wingspan extended from to and was fitted with inboard flaps of the Fowler type, alterations which improved the glide angle, reduced the stalling speed and, through the increased wing loading, raised the maximum cross country speed between thermals. The fuselage of the ≈†ohaj is completely ply skinned, tapering to the tail. The single seat cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing leading has a side opening, single piece, blown perspex canopy. On the first two variants this was short, with an abrupt forward profile but on the ≈†ohaj 3 it was lengthened to the nose, with a much smoother contour. At the rear these canopies merge into the fuselage forward of and over the wing. The fixed tail surfaces have straight leading edges and are ply covered, with rounded, fabric covered control surfaces. The tailplane is mounted just above the fuselage, sufficiently far forward for the elevators to be ahead of the deep rudder, which is protected by a tail bumper. There is an elevator trim tab to adjust for different pilot weights The ≈†ohaj 1 lands on a simple, rubber sprung skid but the later models have a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel just behind the skid which now ends under mid-wing. Operational history At least 286 ≈†ohajs were built, with ≈†ohaj 3 production extending in the later 1950s. One took part in the weather disrupted World Gliding Championships held at Camphill in Derbyshire, UK in 1954 with a Belgian pilot but was damaged in an outfield landing and scored no points.

Reception Pat Ferrara of mania.com comments: \\"Despite the low grade I gave Bound by Iron, there's no doubt that Edward Bolme can write. His pacing builds a tremendous amount of momentum near the end of the novel and his subtle details really help flesh out a land trying to recover from the aftershocks of a horrific war. Interposed with the main plot are also flashbacks of Cimozjen's days in the Iron Band, where an otherwise inanimate Torval really comes to life and establishes the deep friendship which really motivates the entire investigation.

Portrait by Lovis Corinth (1904) Pan (1899/1900 edition) Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Olde (27 April 1855, S√ºderau ‚Äì 25 October 1917, Kassel) was a German painter and art school administrator.  Life  He originally planned to follow family tradition and become a farmer but, over his father's strong objections, went to study with Ludwig von L√∂fftz at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich in 1879.Digitale Bibliothek, retrieved 4 June 2011 He and his friend, the sculptor Adolf Br√ºtt, moved to Italy in 1883. Three years later, however, he decided to attend the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, where he exhibited at the Salon and discovered impressionism. Upon his return to Germany, he was one of the founders of the Munich Secession and, in 1894, helped to create the Schleswig-Holstein Art Appreciation Society. He travelled widely over the next few years and this is considered to be his most creative period. In 1898, he also participated in the founding of the Berlin Secession. Friedrich Nietzsche is one of his most famous portrait subjects. In 1902, when Olde became director of the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School, he began working on plans to create a university and instituted many reforms, including the admission of women. When Br√ºtt became director of the Weimar Sculpture School in 1905, the schools were joined together as the \\"Grand Ducal Saxon College of Fine Arts\\", which would later be joined with the Grand Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts to become the \\"Staatlisches Bauhaus\\" (today's Bauhaus University). During this time, Olde, Br√ºtt and Henry van de Velde acted as advisors for Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst's renovation of Weimar's city center. Olde became the director of the Royal Academy of Art in Kassel in 1911 and began the process of turning that school into a university as well. (Today, it is a division of the University of Kassel called the Kunsthochschule Kassel) Three streets are named after him; in Kiel, D√§nischenhagen (where he is buried) and Blankenfelde-Mahlow. His son, , was also a painter. References  Further reading  * Gabriele Bremer, Heinz Spielmann: Hans Olde und die Freilichtmalerei in Norddeutschland.

The Vancouver Sun By the time he started his own shop Paul had developed his own unique style, and was making a name for himself as a trendsetter with a style that \\"appealed greatly to the young and hip 20-35 demographic.\\" When asked about his imaginative designs he once said: \\"You can‚Äôt expect a grown man to make the switch from a [more traditional] suit to one of my more creative models in one big step. The transition would be too dramatic.\\" During the late 1960s he was often referred to as \\"the Pierre Cardin of Lonsdale Avenue,\\" a reference to the famous Italian fashion designer. But he disliked this comparison, preferring instead to be known simply as Paul Minichiello‚Äî\\"a guy who doesn‚Äôt copy anybody,\\" and \\"who doesn‚Äôt really need to lean on Mr. Cardin or Britain's Hardy Ames for ideas.\\"  Cultural impact  It didn‚Äôt take long for Paul's unique style to catch the eye of local and international celebrities. Soon after it opened, his modest North Shore shop became a regular stop on the travels of many touring musicians, actors, athletes and high-profile businessmen. One famous incident in 1971 saw him outfit Sonny and Cher from head to toe for their first ever TV show, The Nitty Gritty Hour. The couple visited his shop while they were on tour and placed an order so large that he couldn‚Äôt complete it before they had to leave town again, so he flew to Los Angeles the following week and delivered the order personally.In \\"Weekend Wind Down\\" sidebar by Jack Wasserman, Vancouver Sun (date unknown) Another incident, in 1978, saw Eric Clapton in town, though Paul was less inclined to bend over backwards. Clapton said he wanted Paul to come to where he was staying and measure him for a white fur parka, to which Paul replied: \\"If he can‚Äôt come down to my store, like everyone else, to hell with him, whoever he is.\\" Later that same year, Penthouse magazine did a feature on the best dressed men in Vancouver, selecting local radio host and devoted Minichiello client Mike Winlaw, who was photographed modelling one of Paul's custom suits.Sidebar in The Vancouver Sun.

This carbon travels down into the roots of the plant, where some travels back up to the leaves. The fixed carbon traveling to the root is radiated outward into the surrounding soil where microbes use it as food for growth. In return, microbes attach to the plant root where it improves the roots access to nutrients and its resistance to environmental stress and pathogens. In specific plant/root symbiotic relationships, the plant root secretes flavonoids into the soil which is sensed by microbes, where these microbes release nod factors to the plant root which promotes the infection of the plant root. These unique microbes carry out nitrogen fixation in root nodules, which supplies nutrients to the plant. The root microbiome (also called rhizosphere microbiome) is the dynamic community of microorganisms associated with plant roots. Because they are rich in a variety of carbon compounds, plant roots provide unique environments for a diverse assemblage of soil microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and archaea. The microbial communities inside the root and in the rhizosphere are distinct from each other, and from the microbial communities of bulk soil, although there is some overlap in species composition. Different microorganisms, both beneficial and harmful affect development and physiology of plants. Beneficial microorganisms include bacteria that fix nitrogen, promote plant growth, mycorrhizal fungi, mycoparasitic fungi, protozoa and certain biocontrol microorganisms. Pathogenic microorganisms also span certain bacteria, pathogenic fungi and certain nematodes that can colonize the rhizosphere. Pathogens are able to compete with protective microbes and break through innate plant defense mechanisms. Apart from microbes that cause plant diseases, certain bacteria that are pathogenic and can be carried over to humans, such as Salmonella, enterohaemorhagic Escherichia coli, Burkholedria (ceno)cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia can also be detected in root associated microbiome and in plant tissues. Root microbiota affect plant host fitness and productivity in a variety of ways. Members of the root microbiome benefit from plant sugars or other carbon rich molecules. Individual members of the root microbiome may behave differently in association with different plant hosts, or may change the nature of their interaction (along the mutualist-parasite continuum) within a single host as environmental conditions or host health change. Despite the potential importance of the root microbiome for plants and ecosystems, our understanding of how root microbial communities are assembled is in its infancy. This is in part because until recent advances in sequencing technologies, root microbes were difficult to study due to high species diversity, the large number of cryptic species, and the fact that most species have yet to be retrieved in culture. Evidence suggests both biotic (such as host identity and plant neighbor) and abiotic (such as soil structure and nutrient availability) factors affect community composition. Function =Types of symbioses= Root associated microbes include fungi, bacteria, and archaea. In addition, other organisms such as viruses, algae, protozoa, nematodes and arthropods are part of root microbiota. Symbionts associated with plant roots subsist off of photosynthetic products (carbon rich molecules) from the plant host and can exist anywhere on the mutualist/parasite continuum. Root symbionts may improve their host's access to nutrients, produce plant-growth regulators, improve environmental stress tolerance of their host, induce host defenses and systemic resistance against pests or pathogens, or be pathogenic. Parasites consume carbon from the plant without providing any benefit, or providing too little benefit relative to what they cost in carbon, thereby compromising host fitness. Symbionts may be biotrophic (subsisting off of living tissue) or necrotrophic (subsisting off of dead tissue). =Mutualist-parasite continuum= While some microbes may be purely mutualistic or parasitic, many may behave one way or the other depending on the host species with which it is associated, environmental conditions, and host health. A host‚Äôs immune response controls symbiont infection and growth rates. If a host‚Äôs immune response is not able to control a particular microbial species, or if host immunity is compromised, the microbe-plant relationship will likely reside somewhere nearer the parasitic side of the mutualist-parasite continuum. Similarly, high nutrients can push some microbes into parasitic behavior, encouraging unchecked growth at a time when symbionts are no longer needed to aid with nutrient acquisition. Composition Roots are colonized by fungi, bacteria and archaea. Because they are multicellular, fungi can extend hyphae from nutrient exchange organs within host cells into the surrounding rhizosphere and bulk soil. Fungi that extend beyond the root surface and engage in nutrient-carbon exchange with the plant host are commonly considered to be mycorrhizal, but external hyphae can also include other endophytic fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi can extend a great distance into bulk soil, thereby increasing the root system‚Äôs reach and surface area, enabling mycorrhizal fungi to acquire a large percentage of its host plant‚Äôs nutrients. In some ecosystems, up to 80% of plant nitrogen and 90% of plant phosphorus is acquired by mycorrhizal fungi. In return, plants may allocate ~20-40% of their carbon to mycorrhizae. =Fungi = Mycorrhizae Mycorrhizal (from greek) literally means ‚Äúfungus roots‚Äù and defines symbiotic interaction between plants and fungus. Fungi are important to decompose and recycle organic material, however the boundaries between pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles of fungi are not always clear-cut. Most of the time the association is symbiotic with fungus improving acquisition of nutrients and water from soil or increasing stress tolerance and fungus benefiting from carbohydrates produced by plant. Mycorrhizae include a broad variety of root-fungi interactions characterized by mode of colonization. Essentially all plants form mycorrhizal associations, and there is evidence that some mycorrhizae transport carbon and other nutrients not just from soil to plant, but also between different plants in a landscape. The main groups include ectomycorrhizae, arbuscular mycorhizae, ericoid mycorrhizae, orchid mycorrhizae, and monotropoid mycorrhizae. Monotropoid mycorrhizae are associated with plants in the monotropaceae, which lack chlorophyll. Many Orchids are also achlorophyllous for at least part of their life cycle. Thus these mycorrhizal-plant relationships are unique because the fungus provides the host with carbon as well as other nutrients, often by parasitizing other plants. Achlorophyllous plants forming these types of mycorrhizal associations are called mycoheterotrophs. Endophytes Endophytes grow inside the plant tissues - roots, stems, leaves - mostly symptomless, however when plant ages they can become slightly pathogenic. They may colonize inter-cellular spaces, the root cells themselves, or both. Rhizobia and dark septate endophytes (which produce melanin, an antioxidant that may provide resilience against a variety of environmental stresses) are famous examples. = Bacteria = Zone of soil surrounding the roots is ritch in nutrients released by plants and is therefore attractive growth medium for both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria. Root associated beneficial bacteria promote plant growth and provide protection from pathogens. They are mostly rhizobacteria that belong to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, with many examples from Pseudomonas and Bacillus genera. Rhizobium species colonize legume roots forming nodule structures. In response to root exudates, rhizobia produce Nod signalling factors that are recognized by legumes and induce formation of nodules on plant roots. Within these structures Rhizobium perform nitrogen fixation that proves plant with nitrogen source. In turn, plants provide bacteria with carbon source to energize the nitrogen fixation. In addition to nitrogen fixation, Azospirillum species promote plant growth through production of growth phytohormones (auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins). Due to these phytohormones root hairs expand to occupy larger area and better acquire water and nutrients. Pathogenic bacteria that infect plants infect plant roots are most commonly from Pectobacterium, Ralstonia, Dickeya and Agrobacterium genera. Among the most notorious are Pectobacterium carotovorum, Pectobacterium atrosepticum, Ralstonia solanacearum, Dickeya dadanthi, Dickeya solani and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Bacteria attach to roots in a certain biphasic mechanism with two steps ‚Äì first weak, non-specific binding and then switch to second ‚Äì strong irreversible residence phase. Both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria attach in this fashion. Bacteria can stay attached to the outer surface or, certain endophytes or pathogens can colonize the inner root. Primary attachment is governed by chemical forces or certain extracellular structures such as pili or flagella. Secondary attachment is mainly characterized by synthesis of cellulose, extracellular fibrils and specific attachment factors such as surface proteins that help bacteria aggregate and form colonies. =Archaea= Though archaea are traditionally thought of as extremophiles, microbes belonging to extreme environments, advances in metagenomics and gene sequencing reveal that archaea are ubiquitous, found in nearly any environment including the root microbiome. For example, root- colonizing archaea have been discovered in maize, rice, wheat, and mangroves. Methanogen and ammonium-oxidizing archaea are prevalent members of the root microbiome, especially in anaerobic soils and wetlands. Archaeal phyla found in the root microbiome include Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota. The presence and relative abundance of archaea in various environments suggest that they likely play an important role in the root microbiome. Archaea have been found to promote plant growth and development, provide stress tolerance, improve nutrient uptake and protect against pathogens. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana colonized with an ammonia- oxidizing soil archaea, Nitrosocosmicus oleophilius, exhibited increased shoot weight, photosynthetic activity and immune response. Examination of microbial communities in soil and roots identify archaeal organisms and genes that occupy functions similar to that of to bacteria and fungi, such as auxin synthesis, protection against abiotic stress and nitrogen fixation. In some cases, key genes for plant growth and development, such as metabolism and cell wall synthesis, are more prevalent in archaea than bacteria. Archaeal presence in the root microbiome can also be affected by plant hosts, which can change the diversity, presence and health of archaeal communities. = Viruses = Viruses also infect plants via the roots, however to penetrate the root tissues they typically use vectors such as nematodes or fungi. Assembly mechanisms There is an ongoing debate regarding what mechanisms are responsible for assembling individual microbes into communities. There are two primary competing hypotheses. One is that \\"everything is everywhere, but the environment selects,\\" meaning biotic and abiotic factors pose the only constraints, through natural selection, to which microbes colonize what environments. This is called the niche hypothesis, and its counterpart is the hypothesis that neutral processes, such as distance and geographic barriers to dispersal, control microbial community assembly when taxa are equally fit within an environment. In this hypothesis, differences between individual taxa in modes and reach of dispersal explain the differences in microbial communities of different environments. Most likely, both natural selection and neutral processes affect microbial community assembly, though certain microbial taxa may be more restricted by one process or the other depending on their physiological restrictions and mode of dispersion. Microbial dispersal mechanisms include wind, water, and hitchhiking on more mobile macrobes. Microbial dispersion is difficult to study, and little is known about its effect on microbial community assembly relative to the effect of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms, particularly in roots. For this reason only assembly mechanisms that fit within the niche hypothesis are discussed below. The taxa within root microbial communities seem to be drawn from the surrounding soil, though the relative abundance of various taxa may differ greatly from those found in bulk soil due to unique niches in the root and rhizosphere. =Biotic assembly mechanisms= Different parts of the root are associated with different microbial communities. For example, fine roots, root tips, and the main root are all associated with different communities, and the rhizosphere, root surface, and root tissue are all associated with different communities, likely due to the unique chemistry and nutrient status of each of these regions. Additionally different plant species, and even different cultivars, harbor different microbial communities, probably due to host specific immune responses and differences in carbon root exudates. Host age affects root microbial community composition, likely for similar reasons as host identity. The identity of neighboring vegetation has also been shown to impact a host plant's root microbial community composition. =Abiotic assembly mechanisms= Abiotic mechanisms also affect root microbial community assembly because individual taxa have different optima along various environmental gradients, such as nutrient concentrations, pH, moisture, temperature, etc. In addition to chemical and climatic factors, soil structure and disturbance impact root biotic assembly. =Succession= The root microbiome is dynamic, fluid within the constraints imposed by the biotic and abiotic environment. As in macroecological systems, the historical trajectory of the microbiotic community may partially determine the present and future community. Due to antagonistic and mutualistic interactions between microbial taxa, the taxa colonizing a root at any given moment could be expected to influence which new taxa are acquired, and therefore how the community responds to changes in the host or environment. While the effect of initial community on microbial succession has been studied in various environmental samples, human microbiome, and laboratory settings, it has yet to be studied in roots.

The company's field of specialty is reproduction firearms from the American Civil War to the end of the Old West period. Founded by Mike Harvey in Houston, Texas, the company is now based in Fredericksburg, Texas. Cimarron produces firearms within the industry of western reproduction arms. The firearms are manufactured to their specifications by Uberti and Davide Pedersoli in Brescia, Italy. Uberti makes their revolvers, lever action rifles as well as the 1885 single shot falling block rifle, and shotguns. Pedersoli makes rolling block and falling block single shot rifles to their specifications. In 2011 Cimarron contracted Armscor to manufacture a pre-World War 2 pattern 1911 semiautomatic pistol to their specifications. Because of the attention to detail given their firearms, Cimarron's revolvers and rifles have been used by weapons masters in a number of Western Films. Additionally, Cimarron markets several of these firearms to collectors in addition to reenactors and competitive shooters. Many of the company's designs have won awards from True West Magazine's \\"Best of the West\\".  History  Leonard Frank Allen had started Replica Arms, El Paso, Texas in 1962, with the first Colt 1847 Army replica, made by Armi San Marco. In 1965 he sold Replica Arms and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Allen then started Western Arms and found himself the subject of a lawsuit brought on by Winchester as \\"Western Arms\\" was the name of their ammunition company. Allen renamed the company using his surname. Cimarron Firearms began in 1977 as a muzzle loading shop and sporting goods store in Houston, Texas, known as \\"Bigfoot\\". Mike Harvey, who owned the shop, ordered plans for a Hawken rifle from a museum and built his first replica from scratch. As the economy worsened due to the early 1980s oil depression in Texas, Harvey sought to diversify his stock by selling replica old-west firearms. He entered into a joint venture with Allen Arms importing Uberti revolvers from Italy. Dissatisfied with quality, as the guns were larger than the historical pieces upon which they were based and were covered with numerous proof marks that detracted from their appearance, Harvey contacted Uberti and sent specific instructions regarding the forging of revolver frames, metal polishing and case hardening. He followed this up by sending antique firearms from the time periods he wanted, and had Uberti build those firearms to his specifications. Finally he had the proof marks relocated to less conspicuous areas of the firearms in keeping with Italian law and enhancing their appearance. Cimarron was the first firearms company to offer antique finishes on modern made firearms, such as charcoal-bone case hardening. Some finishes are applied in Europe prior to import, and some are applied to bare frames and barrels upon arriving in the US. Firearms author John Taffin has credited Cimarron Arms and its competitor Navy Arms as being instrumental in restoring realism to replica period firearms. Another finish pioneered by the company was that of antiquated metal with engraving. This gives the appearance of a time-worn antique in a new firearm. The engraving on these revolvers matches the time period in which they were made. Percussion revolvers, for example, feature what is known as the New York or Louis Daniel Nimschke style of engraving from the 1850s, while the Cimarron revolvers are decorated in the later style of Colt's engraver Cuno Helfricht. The company maintains a retail shop that specializes in period clothing, accessories and Cimarron firearms known as Texas Jack's Wild West Outfitters, named for Texas Jack Omohundro, as Harvey owns several of his firearms. The shop caters primarily to the film industry and Old West reenactors.  Firearms  = Handguns = A Uberti-made Cimarron Model P in 32-20/32 WCF The company's most popular offering is the Model P based on the Colt Peacemaker. One of the first supporters of SASS and Cowboy Action Shooting, Cimarron makes exclusive versions for competitors such as the \\"Evil Roy\\" model built to the specs of Gene Pearcey. Cimarron was the first company to offer a direct copy of the Colt Single Action Army Revolver in stainless steel that maintained the size and dimensions of the original. Some critics have pointed out that the front sight blade is slightly wider and the rear sight notch is slightly narrower than the original Colt's, but that these changes make for a more accurate and easier to sight revolver. Cimarron designed the first sub-4\\" barrel single- action revolver that used an ejector rod when it introduced the Cimarron Lightning SA model. In addition to replicas of the Colt Single Action Army Revolver, Cimarron imports exclusive replicas of transition pistols between the eras of blackpowder and cartridge revolvers such as the \\"Richards\\" Conversion, \\"Richards-Mason\\" Conversion and the Colt Model 1871-72 Open Top revolvers. In 2011 Cimarron released a copy of the Colt Model 1911 pistol. Made by Armscor in the Philippines the pistol is a replica of the original pre-1923 design for \\"Wild Bunch\\" type shooting matches. The Remington Model 1875 revolver is the most popular non-Colt handgun offered by the company. They briefly offered clones of the Smith & Wesson Schofield revolver, but that model has been discontinued by Cimarron. = Long guns = Cimarron has two- dozen versions of 19th century rifles built to their specifications by Uberti such as the various Henry rifles and Winchester lever-action carbines such as the 1866 Yellowboy, 1873 Winchester and the Winchester Model 1892. Cimarron's 1873 Trapper is a replica of the Winchester Model 1873 carbine with one exception; the company patented a magazine spring and follower to allow a shooter the ability to load 10 cartridges in the short magazine for competition instead of the standard 9 rounds. Cimarron offers a replica of the Civil War era Spencer rifle chambered in a centerfire version of its original rimfire loading as well as more commonly available rounds such as .45 Colt. Aside from repeating rifles, Cimmaron has exclusive single shot Sharps rifles and High and Low Wall single-shot rifles built by Pedersoli and Uberti. These rifles include many custom features not found on other modern reproductions such as cut rifling that has been polished and lapped for accuracy.  Movie firearms  Some production companies use Cimarron's replica firearms in their films, such as the 2010 remake of True Grit, Unforgiven, Lonesome Dove, Far and Away, The Lone Ranger and Young Guns II because of the attention to detail. In 2010 Cimarron's \\"Corporate Exhibition Shooter\\" Joey Dillon trained actor Josh Brolin how to handle single action revolvers authentically and Cimarron provided all the revolvers used in the Jonah Hex film. Over 70 Cimarron firearms were used in Back to the Future Part III and the company provided 26 replica Colt Paterson revolvers for the miniseries James A. Michener's Texas. A pair of Cimarron Single Action revolvers were used by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1995 film The Quick and the Dead. They were nickel- plated, engraved and serial numbered as #C06477 and #C06073. Cimarron furnished the working prop guns for AMC's western series Hell on Wheels and the 2003 motion picture Open Range. Cimarron offers a version of the Colt Buntline revolver named the \\"Wyatt Earp Buntline\\" styled after the Uberti version used by Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp in 1993's Tombstone with a 10\\" barrel and a silver badge inlaid on the right grip panel. Other movie replicas include the \\"Holy Smoker\\" based on the \\"Hand of God\\" revolver used by Russell Crowe's character Ben Wade in 3:10 to Yuma and a copy of Clint Eastwood's \\"Man With No Name\\" revolver. Critics point out that from a historical perspective this type of conversion had no loading lever and included an ejector rod; however, Cimarron was faithful to the movie version which had a loading lever and lacked an ejector rod. Cimarron was the first company to import a replica of the Sharps rifle from Quigley Down Under.  Shooting sports  In addition to manufacturing a variety of firearms used in cowboy action shooting, Cimarron sponsors an all female cowboy mounted shooting team called the \\"Cimarron Firearms Team of World Champions\\" and was one of the earliest proponents of this sport.  Best of the West Awards  Cimarron's firearms have repeatedly won various \\"Best of the West\\" awards from True West Magazine against competing models from Colt, Ruger, and other US arms makers. In 2014 the Cimarron 1883 Double Barrel Shotgun .410 and Cimarron 1887 Hammered Coach Gun won Best Cowboy Action Shotgun for Editor's Choice and Reader's Choice, respectively while the Cimarron 1886 Winchester replica won Best Cowboy Action Rifle. The previous year the 1878 Coach Gun won Best Cowboy Action Shotgun and the Thunderstorm revolver took \\"Best New Western Gun\\". In 2012 the company's 1873 Rifle won the \\"Best Repeating Rifle\\" category. In 2011 Cimarron's 1873 Replica Lever Action Rifle earned Best Cowboy Action Gun. 2010 saw the company earn Best Firearm of the West with their replica 1876 Winchester NWMP Carbine. In 2005 and 2006 Cimarron's Richards-Mason 1851 Navy Conversion won the category for Best Cartridge Conversion Revolver Reproduction In 2004 their 1860 Richards-Mason Army conversion won the same category and the company's Model 1873 Single Action Army won Reader's Choice for Best Single Action Army Reproduction, Cimarron took the same award in 2003. Also in 2003 the Cimarron Arms 1872 Open Top and 1851 Navy .36-Caliber won the honors for Best Cartridge Conversion Revolver Reproduction and Best Cap and Ball Revolver Reproduction.

He was Minister of Agriculture and Commerce for the Executive Commission of 1848. He opposed Louis Napoleon and was forced into exile in the Second French Empire (1852‚Äì1870). Early years Ferdinand Flocon was born in Paris on 1 November 1800. His father worked for the Chappe telegraph service. Flocon was committed to democracy and the republican movement in France. In the 1820s he was a member of the Carbonari. Under the July Monarchy (1830‚Äì1848) he belonged to republican secret societies. Flocon became a stenographer and parliamentary reporter for liberal newspapers. He was also a translator and novelist. He was an editor for le Courrier fran√ßais. Flocon later worked for le Constitutionnel and then for La Tribune. Flocon joined a group of republicans who prepared to overthrow the monarchy when the king died. La R√©forme, founded in 1843, became the organ of this group. It promoted a more assertive line than the moderate republican Le National. The first chief editor was √âl√©onore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac. Flocon took over when Cavaignac died in 1845. He published the main articles of the abolitionist Victor Sch≈ìlcher in 1846‚Äì47. He was not a socialist, but believed in organized labor and the right to work. While he was editor La R√©forme published articles from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, Constantin Pecqueur, Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. Second Republic Flocon frightening Armand Marrast in 1848, by Cham Flocon spoke on Robespierre's 1793 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen at the banquets held before the February Revolution of 1848. From his base at La R√©forme, Flocon was active during the days of the revolution, organizing and speaking. He became a member of the provisional government after the revolution had succeeded. The positions of power in the Provisional Government were mainly given to moderate republicans, although √âtienne Arago was made Minister of Posts and Marc Caussidi√®re became Prefect of Police. Alexandre Martin (\\"Albert\\"), Louis Blanc and Flocon did not get ministerial portfolios, and so had little power. Flocon was able to assist Bakunin with funds for an attempt to stir up a Polish rebellion against the Russians. In April 1848 Flocon was elected a representative for the Seine department in the Constituent Assembly. In this election, only 285 out of 851 of the new deputies had been republicans before the February Revolution, and only six candidates of the radical republicans were elected. They were Flocon, Martin, Blanc, Caussidi√®re, Ledru-Rollin and Agricol Perdiguier. Flocon was chosen by the Executive Committee as Minister of Commerce and Agriculture from 11 May to 28 June 1848. Flocon was hostile to the demonstrators in the June Days Uprising (23‚Äì26 June 1848). He thought that if the uprising had succeeded it would have paved the way for an autocrat to take charge. He supported the assignment of dictatorial power to General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac. However, he was not included in the cabinet formed by Cavaignac at the end of June 1848. After he left government, Flocon consistently voted with the left, including voting for an amnesty for the June insurgents. He failed to be reelected to the Legislative Assembly in May 1849. He moved to Strasbourg, where he edited le D√©mocrate du Rhin, a bi-lingual newspaper. In July 1849 Flocon ran as candidate for Representative for Montpellier, a seat that had been vacated by Ledru-Rollin. He did not campaign actively and was not elected. Last years Flocon spoke out against 2 December 1851 coup d'√©tat in which Louis Napoleon came to power, and was banished from France. He moved to Switzerland, where he continued to agitate for democracy and worked as a bookseller in Geneva and Lausanne. Under pressure from the French government, he was placed under house arrest in Zurich, where he lived in poverty. He died on 15 March 1866 in Lausanne. Works  Ballades allemandes.

It was the creation of overseas trader John Robert Woods and Ernest Vernon Varley Grossmith, a member of a famous perfumery family. Due to anti-German sentiment following the end of World War I, Grossmith dropped his German sounding last name. Varley founded the High Speed Tool Company in Acton, London. In late 1918, the company changed its name to HS Motors Ltd. HS Motors Ltd built an assembled car in 1918‚Äì1919, using Decolonge engines acquired from fellow manufacturer Storey. In mid-1919, unpaid creditors took the company to court, and called-in the bailiffs. The bailiffs arrived at the factory, noted what was of value, and padlocked the premises, stating that if the bills were not paid within seven days, they would return and take everything away to be sold off. Varley and Woods management arrived at the premises with a lorry, knocked a hole in the wall, and removed every item of value The equipment was transported to Wolverhampton. Car manufacture recommenced there, using chassis sourced from Turner, and Dorman 1794cc engines. The Varley-Woods automobile was launched at the 1919 Motor Show at Olympia. There were three models, a 2-seater, priced at ¬£540, a 4-seater tourer, priced at ¬£660, and a coup√©, priced at ¬£760. In 1920 2303cc Taylor engines replaced the Dorman engines, probably due to credit problems in paying Dorman. Prices were higher - the 2-seater was now priced at ¬£695, the tourer at ¬£725, and a limousine at ¬£1,200. By late 1920, the company was unable to pay the rent on the Wolverhampton factory, and the Receiver was called in. In total, Varley and Woods produced approximately 150 cars with Dorman engines and a very small number with Taylor engines. After production ended, Varley moved to a cottage in Cornwall. while Woods travelled to Nyasaland, where he was killed by a lion.

On April 28, 2014, Lifetime announced an additional 10-episode renewal of Bring It!. Additional episodes returned on July 23, 2014. The second season premiered on January 23, 2015. New episodes aired on July 31, 2015. The third season premiered on January 1, 2016. On December 1, 2016, Lifetime renewed the show for a fourth season, which premiered on January 13, 2017. Concurrent, Lifetime added a traveling tour, Bring It Live! Lifetime renewed for the show for a fifth season, which premiered on March 2, 2018. However, according to Dianna Williams, the show has not been cancelled, due to the fact that some girls graduated off the team and Dianna Williams who moved to Atlanta. Premise Bring It! is set in Jackson, Mississippi and features Coach Dianna \\"Miss D\\" Williams and her Dollhouse Dance Factory, home of Miss D's Dancing Dolls team, which was founded in 2001. The troupe has over 15 Grand Champion titles and more than 100 trophies, and consists of children aged 10 to 17. The show also features the Baby Dancing Dolls, consisting of children under the age of 11. The team competes in hip-hop majorette competitions, with their main focus being on the Stand Battle (a routine where two teams face each other and alternate \\"stands\\" (routines), which are called by the captain depending on what stand the other team performs). The team slogan (both the Dancing Dolls and the Baby Dancing Dolls) is \\"Dancing Dolls For Life\\" (popularly shortened to DD4L, featured on much of their gear). Rival dance teams featured on the show include: the Divas of Olive Branch (the Dolls main rival, due to the intense rivalry between Miss D and Divas coach Neva), the Prancing Tigerettes (from Memphis) and the Infamous Dancerettes (f/k/a Dynamic Diamond Dollz, also from Memphis), the Purple Diamonds (a cross-town Jackson rival), the YCDT Superstarz (from Miami) and new rival (from Tupelo, Mississippi) The Golden Prancerettes. Similar to fellow Lifetime show Dance Moms, Bring It! features the moms of several of the dancers and their interactions (and occasional arguments) with Miss D. However, unlike Dance Moms (where the moms are in a room above the studio watching the practices), the moms in Bring It! are featured outside the studio. In early seasons, the parents could only see what happens in practice through the studio windows; in later seasons Miss D has made a room for the parents to watch the girls through a TV screen. (Miss D does not allow parents inside the studio during practices, believing that the dancers need to have only one person ‚Äì Miss D ‚Äì leading them at those times.)

In 2017 and 2018, a scandal over executive perks and misuse of council credit cards ‚Äî costing ratepayers $70,000 in 18 months ‚Äî came to public attention. This included the purchasing of golf club memberships, roof-top climbs, taxis and hotels for council CEO Mark Dowd, and international trips for the mayor. In May 2018, the Ombudsman commenced an investigation into the council's spending, and on 5 June 2018, the council passed a vote of no confidence in Rosenberg. Mayors around the state spoke out against the Onkaparinga council, and on 7 June, Rosenberg was asked to step down as LGASA president. Although initially intending to recontest, on 14 August, Rosenberg announced she would not run again for mayor at the 2018 local government elections.

In the 1950s, the Archbishop of St. John's, Patrick Skinner decided that the area needed a chapel and school of its own. In 1955, a site was acquired to serve as a St. Pius X Elementary School. On 19 September 1955, the school was opened and was staffed by the Sisters of Mercy. The ground floor of the school became a chapel and was also dedicated to Saint Pius X on 15 January 1956.Parish History from SPX.ca, retrieved 19 March 2014 The St Pius X chapel remained a mission of the basilica until 1962, when Archbishop Skinner invited the Society of Jesus to take over the administration of the parish and set up Gonzaga High School.Church, schools vandalized in St. John's from CBC News retrieved 19 March 2014 On 2 September 1962, the chapel became a parish church, when the archbishop officially opened it. In 1967, the elementary school became a school for girls and a St Pius X Boys' School was opened and was staffed by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. From 1968, it became clear that a new, larger church was required to accommodate the congregation and plans were drawn up. On 1 December 1976, in the presence of Archbishop Skinner and Archbishop Penney the new church of St Pius X was opened. It was designed by a local architect, Angus Campbell. The chapel that was previously used, was renovated and became a parish hall for the church and a sports hall for the school. In 1987, a new organ was installed in the church, bought from Casavant Fr√®res. In 1978, the Sisters of Mercy withdrew from the Girls' School and four years later, in 1982, the Christian Brothers left the Boys' School. Since then, the two schools have been reorganized so that two co-educational schools were formed, one elementary and one junior high school. In 1999, after the Public School Board took over the schools, the elementary school was closed down (the original elementary school building reverted to parish use) and the junior high school was renamed Rennies River School. The Public School Board also took over Gonzaga High School. The Jesuits, that year, reopened an independent Catholic school, Saint Bonaventure's College in the city.

The house is named after the Sicilian-born composer Vincenzo Bellini, who is best known for his operas and who spent some time in the 1820s studying music in the city. In addition, there in an opera house name after him, the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, Sicily, his birthplace. History In 1864, Baron Nicola Lacapra Sabelli commissioned the theatre's creation by the architect Carlo Sorgente on Via Vincenzo Bellini. This theatre, located near Piazza Dante Alighieri, burned down in 1869, and a new one was inaugurated a few hundred feet from the original locale. Interior of theater as it looks today On 6 February 1877, Bellini's opera I puritani was performed there. The theatre has six tiers of box seats surrounding an oval floor.Napoli nobilissima, Volumes 13-15, page 106. The interior decorations were created by Giovanni Ponticelli, Pasquale Di Criscito, and Vincenzo Paliotti, and the oil portrait of the opera composer was done by Vincenzo Migliaro. For nearly a century, the theatre presented operas and operettas, but by the 1960s, it had become dilapidated, used only as a cheap movie theatre, and it was considered for demolition. In 1962, the Bellini hosted its final operatic spectacle with Masaniello, before being acquired in 1986 by a group led by local artist and producer Tato Russo. They restored the house for operatic and theatrical productions, which are now frequently presented.

Goodwin, pp. 419‚Äì420.  Background  Goodwin was born on December 18, 1834, in Livingston County, New York, the second child of Simeon S. Goodwin and Elizabeth (Albright) Goodwin. His father was a blacksmith who later went into carriagemaking on a large scale. He attended common school in Mount Morris, New York, then after preparatory study entered Genesee College in the winter of 1851, and remained until 1854, when, owing to a clash within the faculty, he and several fellow students withdrew and entered the senior class at Williams College in Massachusetts, at that time run by Mark Hopkins. At the end of one term, the trouble at Genesee College having been settled, he and some others returned and graduated in the fall of 1854. He taught at a district school at Cuylerville, New York for a year, then entered the Albany Law School, and in the winter of that year was admitted to practice. In the spring of 1856 he married Harriet C. Decker, of Lima, New York, and with money barely sufficient to defray their traveling expenses, removed to the West, settling in May 1856 in Menasha.  Politics and public life  He helped organize the first Republican club of Menasha, and took an active part in the presidential election of 1856, stumping for John C. Fremont. In 1859 he was elected to represent the northern Assembly district of Winnebago County. He was chairman of the standing committee on printing. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, in 1862, he helped organize the 2nd Regiment Wisconsin Volunteers, which eventually became the 41st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and served as a colonel in it. After the war he moved to Milwaukee, where he was an assessor of internal revenue for the United States government. He was a candidate for Congressman as the nominee of the Trades Assembly in 1882. He died from complications of diabetes on May 1, 1886 in Milwaukee.

The 1,600-seat theater was built on the site of Omaha's first movie theater, the Parlor. In later years the theater was renamed the Town Theater and eventually the Cooper Theater. The building was demolished in 1976.  History  The Moon Theater was built for the World Realty Company in 1918 at 1410 Douglas Street, and was built right next door to the existing Rialto Theater. The Moon joined the company's other theaters, the Sun Theater at 1410 Farnam Street and the Muse Theater at 24th and Farnam Streets. A fourth theater, the World Theater would, in later years, join the trio. The Moon Theater was a Moorish-style building designed by Harry Lawrie of the Omaha architectural firm of Mendelssohn, Fisher and Lawrie. The brick and steel structure boasted an exterior finish of terra cotta, white tile and marble. Over the entrance canopy hung a sign thirty-feet in height with the image of a crescent moon. The interior included decorative painted panels depicting scenes of historic interest and locations within the U.S. National Parks. Playing off the theater's name, the theater's marquee prior to its opening announced, \\"Moon Rises Next Sat Eve, Sessue Hayakawa in Gray Horizons\\". During a promotion for The Great Air Robbery, an Essex Motors touring car built to replicate a 600-pound airplane bomber was driven through the streets of Omaha to the entry of the Moon Theater. In 1929, the Moon Theater became a Burlesque theater. In 1933, it became the Town Theater, hosting both stage shows and movies. Its first stage show under its new name was Talk o' the Town. It was remodeled in 1958 for Cinerama by the Cooper Foundation. It opened as the Cooper Theater with a showing of South Pacific, for a record 78 weeks. At the time, the South Pacific run set a record for the longest movie run. The Cinerama equipment was later moved to the Cooper Foundation's new Indian Hills Theater. The last movie shown at the Cooper Theater was Serpico in June 1974. The theater was demolished at the beginning of 1976. The Union Pacific Headquarters building occupies the lot.

The album is named after Henri Michaux's description of the feeling of using mescaline in Mis√©rable Miracle. Overview The title track begins with a vocoded Sakamoto reading \\"Jinggang Mountain\\", a poem written by Mao Zedong during his visit to a well in the Jinggang Mountains in 1965. The song proper is performed in a reggae hymn style, inspired by Herbie Hancock's Speak Like a Child album. The piece segues into \\"Island of Woods\\", a ten-minute analog synthesizer composition designed to sound like the natural sounds of an island. The modern classical piano piece \\"Grasshoppers\\" follows. On original copies of the album, the entire first side was indexed as one 24:40 long track. The second side of the album contains varied electronic music pieces. \\"The End of Asia\\" uses the same melody as Haruomi Hosono's \\"Worry Beads\\" from Paraiso (though Sakamoto has claimed that the use was entirely coincidental) and the coda uses the melody of \\"The East Is Red\\", the national anthem of the People's Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution. Thus, the album as a whole summarizes Sakamoto's then-interest in Chinese history. \\"Thousand Knives\\" is a staple of Sakamoto's repertoire, being rearranged for his synth-pop band Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1980 for their BGM album; as a classical trio for 8/21/1996; and for a piano duet on /05. Numerous other arrangements have been performed live over the years, both by YMO and by Sakamoto himself; these performances contain one of the earliest uses of the Roland TR-808 drum machine. \\"Plastic Bamboo\\" was also a staple of early YMO shows, though the only recording appears on their live album Live at Kinokuniya Hall 1978 released in 1994, sixteen years after being recorded. \\"The End of Asia\\" would also regularly appear during YMO shows, with a drastically different studio version included on their X‚àûMultiplies album.

He headed Volkswagenwerk GmbH between 1941 and 1945, which produced the Volkswagen vehicles (KdF-Wagen) at the factory in Wolfsburg, Germany. Biography Pi√´ch was born 21 September 1894 in Vienna, the son of lawyer Anton Paul Pi√´ch. He studied at the University of Vienna and received his doctorate of jurisprudence in 1922. He established himself as a lawyer in his hometown, where his clients included several Austrian Nazis, among others.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 914. At the end of the 1920s, he defended Ferdinand Porsche in litigation against Daimler-Benz over an employment contract.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 916. In 1928, Pi√´ch married Louise Porsche, the daughter of Ferdinand Porsche. Together they had three sons, Ernst (born 1929), Ferdinand (born 1937), and Hans-Michel (born 1942), and a daughter, Louise Daxer-Pi√´ch (1932‚Äì2006). Pi√´ch had a 15% share in the founding of the Porsche company in Stuttgart on 25 April 1931. In the Kommanditgesellschaft founded in 1937 (Porsche KG), his share was 10%. Pi√´ch represented the company in legal and contractual matters.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 74. In May 1933, Pi√´ch a became a member of the then-illegal Austrian Nazi Party. In July 1937, months before the Anschluss, he joined the NSDAP of Nazi Germany. He joined the SS in 1944.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 915. In June 1941, Pi√´ch took over as plant manager at the plant where Volkswagen were produced in Wolfsburg. He succeeded Otto Dyckhoff as one of the managers of Volkswagenwerk GmbH, along with Ferdinand Porsche and Bodo Lafferentz, which decades later would become the current Volkswagen Group.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 222. As Ferdinand Porsche's right-hand man, Pi√´ch became involved in the adaptation of the Wolfsburg plant for the manufacture of weapons, like the V-1 flying bomb.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 477. Under his leadership, 20,000 forced laborers from Poland, the USSR, Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands worked in the plant, as well as German political prisoners, and from 1942 to 1945, Arbeitsdorf concentration camp prisoners. In total, they accounted for about two-thirds of the work force of the plant during World War II. According to some incomplete lists, some 500 prisoners of war, deportees, and concentration camp prisoners died in Wolfsburg. In R√ºhen, near the factory, an orphanage for babies of the forced laborers was built. At least 350 children died there, being separated from their mothers two weeks after birth so that they could return to work.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 763. Pi√´ch was also a factory leader of four companies of the Volkssturm, whose soldiers mostly kept in some kind of relationship with the factory. On 10 April 1945 he ordered his troops to withdraw towards the Elbe. Under the pretext of relocating the address of Volkswagenwerk GmbH to a safe place, he moved 10 million Reichsmark from Nejdek to Zell am See, where his family owned a farm. The money was supposed to be used for the relocation of a factory from Nejdek to Allg√§u, but this never came to happen, and no funds ended up financing Porsche KG. After the war, due to the absence of a notice of dismissal, Pi√´ch continued to serve as chief executive of Volkswagenwerk GmbH until November 1945. He used these final months to pay off bills of Porsche KG.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 927. At the request of the French Minister of Justice Pierre-Henri Teitgen, Pi√´ch was arrested in late 1945 in Baden-Baden together with Ferdinand Porsche and Ferry Porsche, following an invitation from French Minister of Industrial Production Marcel Paul. They were accused of forcibly transferring French workers to Wolfsburg, and organizing the deportation of executives of Peugeot to Nazi concentration camps during the German occupation of France. They were also held responsible for dismantling and moving Peugeot equipment and tools to the VW factory. Pi√´ch and Ferdinand Porsche spent 22 months in French prisons. Ferdinand Porsche was ultimately absolved of responsibility by testimony made in court by many witnesses.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 942. On 17 September 1948 in Bad Reichenhall, Pi√´ch participated in the signing of the agreement between Volkswagenwerk GmbH (under the leadership of new CEO Heinrich Nordhoff) and Porsche Kommanditgesellschaft. As a result of the new treaty, Porsche was put in charge of the development activity of Volkswagen, as it occurred to date. Through license fees and representation rights paid by VW, financial foundation was laid for the new plant of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG.Mommsen, Grieger (1996), p. 938. In 1950, Pi√´ch was manager of the Porsche Konstruktionen-GmbH in Salzburg, which was founded on 1 April 1947 in Gm√ºnd in K√§rnten, and of the \\"Volkswagen General Agency\\" in Austria, located in Salzburg, which later would become the Porsche Holding, currently the majority shareholder of Volkswagen Group.

It was first published in 1938 with illustrations by Steven Spurrier. For this novel, Streatfeild was awarded the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's outstanding children's book by a British subject.Carnegie Archive American editions and some later British editions are titled Circus Shoes.The Circus Is Coming at Fantastic Fiction  Plot summary  After an unusually sheltered upbringing by their old-fashioned and snobbish aunt, 11-year-old Santa and her 12-year-old brother Peter are faced with the prospect of separate orphanages when she dies. They set out to find their unknown Uncle Gus, who travels with Cob's Circus. They are surprised to find out that he is a clown and a trapeze artist. Gus is taken aback by their sudden appearance and is inclined to send them to the orphanages after all, but he is persuaded to let them stay with the circus for the season. They are fascinated by the life and work hard to fit in, Peter being drawn to the horses and Santa taking up acrobatics. They learn the truth about their family's origins in domestic service, and while it is a shock at first, soon they are glad not to have to live up to their aunt's aristocratic pretensions. They hear many tales of circus life as they travel around the country. At the end of the season, Gus agrees that they have earned a chance to stay with the circus.

Before the drawings were finalised, Spurrier fell ill, and the book was issued with reproductions of the original sketches, \\"full of swift and lively observation\\". The first American edition (1939) was illustrated by Richard Floethe in a striking but more conventional style.Circus Shoes at WorldCat Another notable illustrator was Clarke Hutton whose illustrations for the 1947 edition1947 edition at WorldCat also appeared in the 1956 Puffin Books edition. Literary significance and reception John Rowe Townsend describes The Circus Is Coming as Noel Streatfeild's best-known and possibly her best pre-war book.John Rowe Townsend, Written for Children: An Outline of English-language Children's Literature, third revised edition, Penguin Books, 1987, p. 165 Townsend commends the detailed personal research which gives the book so much authenticity and compares it with Streatfeild's perceptive writing on family, suggesting that the circus is a \\"super-family\\". Roger Lancelyn Green mentions the novelistic skill and meticulous accuracy typical of Streatfeild's exceptional career books.Roger Lancelyn Green, Tellers of Tales, revised edition, Edmund Ward, 1965, pp. 263‚Äì264 In her biography of the author, Angela Bull notes that while \\"most reviewers praised it warmly\\", the Time and Tide reviewer thoroughly disliked Peter and Santa, wishing that Noel had \\"killed them off, instead of trailing them through the book and nearly spoiling her excellent material\\".Angela Bull, Noel Streatfeild, William Collins, Sons 1984, pp. 152‚Äì153 Noel Streatfeild received the Carnegie Medal for The Circus Is Coming in the award's third year. Her Ballet Shoes had been considered for the medal in the first year, as had Howard Spring's Sampson's Circus. The Circus Is Coming combines the circus setting of Spring's adventure story (which also had illustrations by Spurrier) with the artiste training of Ballet Shoes. It also has main characters of both sexes, like the winner of that first year's medal, Pigeon Post.

Their first fiction feature Something Must Break (2014) has been shown in more than fifty festivals all over the world during 2014, and it will be presented in Cleveland, Guadalajara and Dublin film festivals in 2015. The film has won ten awards, including the Tiger Award, 43rd Rotterdam International Film Festival, the Grand Jury Award in Outfest Los Angeles LGBT Film Festival or Best Film and Best Performance for Saga Becker in the Lisbon International Queer Film Festival.  Biography  Ester Martin Bergsmark was born September 29, 1982 in Stockholm, Sweden. They studied documentary filmmaking at Biskops Arn√∂ Nordens Folkh√∂gskola and were also trained at the Swedish University College of Arts Crafts and Design. Together with Swedish director Mark Hammarberg, Bergsmark directed the short film Sv√§lj (2006) and the documentary Maggie in Wonderland (Swedish: Maggie Vaknar p√• Balkongen) (2008). In Maggie in Wonderland they worked together with Maggie Beatrice \\"Maggie\\" Andersson and also participated in Sv√§lj. Maggie in Wonderland was rewarded with a Guldbagge Award for best documentary the same year as it was released. 2009 Bergsmark took part in a feminist project in which several directors and artists directed short movies for a collection called Dirty Diaries. The collection was made with the aim to rethink pornography and consists of 12 shorts and Bergsmark's segment is called Fruitcake. 2009 was also the year Bergsmark got the legal right to change their first name to Ester. Before it had not been possible as the previous name law in Sweden had denied people from adding or changing their name to one from another legal gender. Bergsmark received another Guldbagge Award nomination for best documentary 2012 for the movie She Male Snails. The movie was made in collaboration with Swedish author Eli Lev√©n. Bergsmark and Lev√©n had previously been in a relationship that ended a couple of months before the filming of She Male Snails begun. The movie protests against the binary gender system that consists of women and men and begins with Bergsmark talking about the first time they saw Lev√©n as a teenager and the fact that Lev√©n dared being something beyond boy or girl. In interviews Bergsmark has said that while not wanting to live as a woman they consider themself a trans person and find security in not having to have a static gender identity. The movie is a mix of documentary and fiction and received financial support for feature movies. In the fall of 2011 Bergsmark and Lev√©n moved to Berlin and worked together in a mutual office on the manuscript to Bergsmark's film Something Must Break. Something Must Break (2014) opened the Gothenburg Film Festival 2014 and was nominated for a Dragon Award for Best Nordic picture. The movie is based on a book by Lev√©n (Swedish title: Du √§r r√∂tterna som sover vid mina f√∂tter och h√•ller jorden p√• plats). Just like She Male Snails Something Must Break deals with the topic of belonging somewhere in between what is considered being male and what is considered being female. It also circles around young love and beginning to accept yourself. 2014 Bergsmark received the Mai Zetterling-scholarship, a scholarship for movie directors working with short movies or documentaries. The scholarship was handed out at the Gothenburg Film Festival on the January 24 that year.

The site of the colonial community is eleven miles southwest of downtown Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1754, Bedford County was formed and New London was established as the county seat. Situated near the intersection of the Great Wagon Road and the Wilderness Road, the town was an important stopping point for settlers heading west. It was in the courthouse located in New London that Patrick Henry delivered his famous \\"beef\\" speech during the John Hook trial. Also available from the Patrick Henry Memorial Foundation Digital Library. Other prominent historical figures with connections to New London include Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson constructed his retreat, Poplar Forest, near New London in Bedford County. New London was also home to a Revolutionary-era arsenal. In 1781, Bedford County was divided in two, forming Campbell County. The Bedford county seat was then relocated to Liberty, later known as the town of Bedford. After the county seat and court were moved, the former bustling commercial center declined. In the 19th century, the rising popularity of mineral springs sparked a brief revival. The Bedford Alum Springs Hotel, located in New London, drew visitors seeking the benefits of the nearby natural springs. The town sought to capitalize on this attraction and changed its name from New London to Bedford Springs in 1880. New London is home to several historic structures. Mead's Tavern is the sole remaining building from the colonial era, but several historic buildings from the later period are still standing. These include the former Bedford Alum Springs Hotel, the office of Dr. Nicholas Kabler, the W.W. Driskill General Store, two Methodist churches, and the Holt-Ashwell house. The New London Academy (Virginia) is still in operation today as an elementary school. In 2015, the Friends of New London, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving historic New London, sold Mead's Tavern to Liberty University. Current archaeological and architectural studies at Mead's Tavern are contributing to what is known about the building, the town, and the people who lived and worked there.  History  = Colonial History = In 1753, William Callaway contributed 100 acres of land to the Virginia General Assembly for the creation of a new town which would soon serve as the county seat of the newly formed Bedford County. This tract of land became New London. In 1754, the courthouse and jail were erected. The town was laid out in lots and offered for sale. The town charter required that owners must construct a building of at least twenty-by-sixteen within one year. Its location at the intersection of the Great Wagon Road and Wilderness Road meant that it became a bustling center of travel and trade. It remained so until the formation of Campbell County in 1781 and the subsequent relocation of the county seat. The New London courthouse was an important landmark of this time. The John Hook trial took place in the courthouse. During the Revolutionary War John Hook, a Scottish-born merchant living in New London, was accused of being sympathetic to the British. In 1781, John Venable, the commissary for the American army seized two of John Hook's steers for the army to eat. John Hook brought a case against John Venable for taking his property. The case stays on the docket until 1789. During the trial Patrick Henry defended the state and John Venable against John Hook. On September 19, 1789 Patrick Henry delivered his famous \\"beef speech\\". = John Hook = Portion of a page from one of John Hook's business ledgers showing a transaction of \\"1 yoke of oxen\\" with Thomas Jefferson on May 28, 1784, Picture part of the John Hook Papers, Rubenstein Library, Duke University One of the best-documented merchants in Virginia and an early member of the town of New London, John Hook demonstrated how consumerism worked in Colonial and Post Colonial Virginia. He squabbled with rivals, complained to the firm's partners in Scotland, and grew discouraged that he had not achieved the dream of great wealth. Yet in only a quarter- century, Hook went from doing menial tasks in an established Tidewater store, to managing a store in Piedmont, to imagining expanding his business as the line of European settlement roared westward.Smart Martin, Ann (2008). Buying into the World of Goods - Early Consumers in Backcountry Virginia. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 11\\\\. .  Early years and move to New London  Born in Scotland, John Hook (1745-1808) arrived in America as an apprentice at the age of 13 in 1758. He began his training as a shopkeeper and clerk learning the tobacco trade under the training of the Donald family, a Scottish family that dealt in tobacco in the Chesapeake area.Hook, John. \\"John Hook Papers.\\" David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Edited by February 2011 Encoded by Meghan Lyon. Duke University, Processed by Rubenstein Library Staff, 1950s. In 1764 Hook traveled from Chesapeake to New London, Virginia, where he partnered with William and James Donald to establish a store. By 1768 Hook was doing well in New London and wrote to his partner in Scotland stating ‚Äúthis and the adjacent Frontier counties is settling unaccountable fast from people below (the fall line of the James River) and from the Northward.‚Äù In 1770 John Hook married Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Colonel John Smith of Goochland. John and Elizabeth had six children.  Hook the Loyalist  In June 1775, word was given to the Committee for Bedford County that John Hook had been heard making remarks and handing out pamphlets against the war with England. Hook wrote back to the committee asking for the charges in writing to which he responded with a declaration of his innocence. On June 18, 1777, a mob led by Colonel William Mead dragged Hook from his house to appear before the committee. According to Hook, they threatened to \\"burn down & cut my house to peaces over my head\\" and he was told \\"they intended tarring & feathering me.\\"Holland, Maggie (June 1925). \\"John Hook* as a Loyalist\\". Virginia Council Journals: 399‚Äì403 ‚Äì via Maggie Holland of Moneta, Franklin County, Virginia, a great, great granddaughter of John Hook. Ultimately, Hook was forced to sign a Certificate of Fidelity for Captain George Hancock at the Green Bryor Court on October 10, 1777, an act witnessed by Samuel Hairston.  Hook Trial  During the latter part of the Revolutionary War Army Commissary John Venable requisitioned two of Hook's cows for the troops. In 1783, after the war was over, Hook filed suit against Venable for the \\"theft\\" of the two cows. The case lingered on the docket until 1789. Hook was represented by Mr. Cowan and Venable acquired the services of none other than Patrick Henry. The trial itself was the occasion for Henry's famous \\"Beef speech\\" which elicited hoots and laughter from the courtroom The resulting verdict was for Hook for the sum of one cent.  John Hook Collection  Hook is one of the best documented merchants of Colonial America. The bulk of his surviving papers are held at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University. =19th Century History= By the early 1800s, New London began to fade as an independent township due to the relocation of the county seat in 1781. Locals of both Bedford County and Campbell County created a petition for a new county to be created in 1813 with New London at its center, but the movement did not gain traction and ultimately failed. Though it lost the court seat, New London's position next to a crossroad allowed it to have many visitors and even some prominent guests. In April 1816, General Andrew Jackson stayed in the town and almost had a duel in a New London tavern as he was passing through. Around 1820, the dirt Salem-Lynchburg Turnpike was covered with broken stone (macadam) which made traveling to and from New London smoother and helped to boost trade, at least until the introduction of the railroad in nearby Lynchburg in 1848. New London changed its name to Bedford Springs in the late 1870s after the Echols family marketed water from the nearby alum spring and a large health resort named The Bedford Alum Springs Hotel opened in 1878. = Education History = In the early 19th century, New London was the location of at least two schools, the New London Academy and the Roland School for girls. New London Academy was a prominent secondary educational institution throughout the 19th century. In the first half of the 19th century, the Academy offered a range of subjects and students would receive an individual diploma for every subject completed.History of Campbell County ‚Äì https://web.archive.org/web/20140320053751/http://www.co.campbell.va.us/Pages/historicresources.aspx New London Academy was so renowned, that Francis Eppes attended the academy at the insistence of his grandfather, Thomas Jefferson. Even during the Civil War, it managed to remain in operation. In its early years, the school had a strong religious affiliation. The school grounds were home to a brick Episcopal meeting house, and the ministers of the church were often the principals of the school. This religious connotation eventually faded, starting with the removal of the Academy Church in 1856 to another location after the original brick building was condemned and torn down in 1855. This separation of the church from the academy lead to it becoming a public school in 1870 and a coeducational school in 1879. New London also hosted the Roland School for girls between 1812 and 1822 in the former Mead's Tavern. Roland was a finishing school run by Samuel T. Miller and his wife and may have held up to forty students at a time. The school closed in 1822 when Samuel Miller moved to Lynchburg to start another school.Lichtenberger, Randy . Phase I Archaeological Survey of the Mead's Tavern Site (44CP0244), Campbell County, Virginia. Report no. 20150754. History, Liberty University. Lynchburg, VA: Liberty University, 2016. = Military History = The historic marker at New London incorrectly states that Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton raided New London. It is possible that because of New London's central location in Bedford County it was a natural place for the county militia to drill and assemble for war. The county militia participated in several frontier conflicts including the French and Indian and Anglo-Cherokee wars. During the early French and Indian war, the Cherokees were allied with the British. That all changed when a series of misunderstandings and thefts led to a confrontation in 1758 between a Cherokee war party and colonists from Bedford County that left at least five Virginians and thirty Cherokees dead. This incident near New London exacerbated the already tense relationship between the British and the Cherokees and helped set in motion the events that led to the Anglo-Cherokee War. = Arsenal = During the Revolutionary War, New London was home to an arsenal used by the Virginia state militia. The weapons and supplies manufactured in the arsenal were used to help support the campaigns of General Nathaniel Greene in the South and Colonel George Rogers Clark in the Ohio river valley. In his memoirs, British Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton claims to have raided New London in search of the arsenal and the supplies that were stored there. However, according to Thomas Jefferson, Tarleton never made it to New London and stayed closer to Charlottesville. The New London arsenal was operated by the state of Virginia until 1794 when Congress passed a law authorizing the war department to erect \\"three or four arsenals\\" to supply and equip the army. New London's existing state arsenal made it a natural choice for use as a federal arsenal. Shortly after its acquisition by the war department, the New London arsenal helped furnish the weapons and equipment used by the army sent to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania in 1794. The arsenal only remained operational under Federal control for a short time. In 1798 the war department began the process of moving the arsenal to a new location with the transfer of armorer's tools from New London to Harper's Ferry. After the means of production were moved, New London continued to be used for the storage of military equipment until at least 1812. Today, Liberty University and the Friends of New London are hoping to conduct further investigations into finding the location of the arsenal, though historians believe it may have been located on the property of the Bedford Alum Springs Hotel.  Historic structures  = Mead's Tavern = Front view of Mead's Tavern left Mead's Tavern is the oldest standing structure in the Central Virginia area and the only remaining building from New London's colonial era. In 1761, William Mead acquired Lot 6 and constructed what was described as a \\"magnificent house\\" in 1763. In 1784, Mead sold the building which operated as a tavern for the next 20 years or so and was then converted into a girls' school. For most of its life, the former tavern served primarily as a family residence. It also housed the office of Dr. Thaddeus Kabler and later the office of William Abbott, an insurance agent. After passing through the hands of various private owners, the building was purchased by the Friends of New London in 2012 who sold the building to Liberty University in 2015. There is archaeological and architectural evidence, such as the English bond brick style of the foundation, that prove even without the written records that the Tavern was built in the 1700s. Investigations have also uncovered evidence of another building that was a part of the property that is believed to have probably been the kitchen. There were also additional smaller buildings on the property that will likely turn up evidence once further investigation is done to the back of the property. Unlike most of the New London area, the property that Mead's Tavern sits on has been predominately left alone.Rakes, Barry and Pezzoni, Daniel. \\"Interim Historic Structures Report Mead's Tavern New London, Virginia\\". Published by Liberty University. November 2018. Liberty is in the process of doing archaeological and architectural studies of the property. = Bedford Alum Springs Hotel = 262x262px268x268px The property site of the hotel had a history in New London before the building of the hotel. It was originally owned by the Colonel James Callaway who was a patriot in the Revolutionary War and an influential man in Virginia during his life time (1735-1809). Because of Colonel Callaway‚Äôs reputation and the amount of other buildings that are known to have been on site, the property that the hotel sits on is a suspected spot for the revolutionary arsenal that was kept at New London, though there has yet to be any substantial evidence to support this theory. Mead‚Äôs Tavern and the hotel property are connected as the man who ran the Roland Academy girls school located at Mead‚Äôs, Samuel Miller, acquired the hotel property. The property passed to one more owner, a Ralph Smith, before being bought by Peregrine Echols in 1833.Lichtenberger, Randy. \\"Bedford Alum Springs Hotel: Preliminary Report\\". Published by Liberty University. 2015. Bedford Alum Springs Hotel was originally a tavern owned by Peregrine Echols.left Echols was also the first person in New London to capitalize on the natural alum springs that were located a short walk away from his property by bottling and selling the water for medicinal uses. The hotel was given the name The Bedford Alum Springs Hotel and was promoted as a resort, attracting travelers who sought the benefit of the nearby alum springs. The success of the alum springs prompted the town to change its name from New London to Bedford Springs. In 1871, a fire burned down the original building. In 1877, the property that held Echols tavern was sold to John Maben who proceeded to build a large hotel. That building was burned in another fire in 1887. The hotel was rebuilt again, only to burn once more in 1902. The third rebuilt version of the hotel is what stands today. The historic site was bought by Liberty University in 2018.https://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/liberty-university-purchases-new- london-historic-site/article_25615974-4264-5ed3-9865-a25041b3a0d5.html Liberty has plans of archaeological and architectural investigations for the hotel and property. W.W. Driskill Store, New London, Virginia, Image Taken in 2019 = W.W. Driskill Store = The general store in New London was built by Willis Washington Driskill in 1897 and remained in operation until the 1930s. It also housed the Bedford Springs post office until mail delivery was discontinued at this location in 1911. The building has been restored by its current owners and retains many of its original features. The building sits on one possible site of the colonial era military arsenal. = Holt-Ashwell House = This small, frame house dates to at least the early 19th-century with elements that may indicate earlier construction. Situated on what was Lot 17 in the original town, it was the home of Andrew Holt, an emancipated African American who was able to earn enough income as a baker to purchase the freedom of his wife and two sons. In 1851, he was charged with holding \\"an unlawful assemblage of negroes\\" in his home. The charges were dismissed and shortly thereafter, he donated a small section of his property for the construction of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The current church building is the third structure on that lot. The house itself was unoccupied when it burned in 2017. The owner subsequently donated the property to the Friends of New London who have cleaned out the house and are considering options for restoration. =Churches= The New London Methodist church was built in 1850 several years after a congregation was organized. The church was home to circuit riding ministers who would travel to several different churches throughout the year. The New London Methodist Church belonged to the Bedford Alum Springs circuit. The church is still standing and is used as an office for the Friends of New London, who have worked to restore the town. The current New London Methodist Episcopal Church South was erected in 1930, the third church building to be erected on this site since it was originally donated for the purpose. It remained in use for sixty years before it closed in 1990. In 1851 Andrew Holt, an emancipated African American man donated the small parcel for the construction of a church \\"for the special but not exclusive benefit of coloured people.\\" The building is now owned by the Friends of New London and restoration plans are underway.  Historic Cemeteries  = African American Cemetery. = Dating back to the mid-late 19th century, the cemetery was where the slaves and freed blacks of New London would bury their deceased loved ones. The cemetery is currently overseen and maintained by Deloris Nash Hicks, a direct descendant of those buried there. Current efforts are being made to clean up the historic cemetery and to bring its burial grounds back to life. = Callaway-Steptoe Cemetery = The Callaway-Steptoe Cemetery, located on the property of Federal Hill in Forest, Virginia, serves as the final resting place for several prominent area settlers and their descendants including Col. William Callaway as well as his son-in-law James Steptoe. This cemetery was also the location of a skirmish that took place between Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. Evidence of the skirmish can still be seen today with holes in the walls surrounding the cemetery from cannonball fire.Front view of the African American Church  Restoration  In 2005, members of the local community formed the Friends of New London for the purpose of recovering and preserving the history of the town. In 2015, with the sale of Mead's Tavern to Liberty University, a partnership was formed that would create opportunities for students to contribute to and learn from the restoration and preservation process. In 2017, the Friends of New London acquired three additional buildings: the African American Methodist Church which was originally planned to be demolished; the New London Methodist Church which houses the Friends of New London office and library; and the Holt- Ashwell house, a 19th-century house which was badly damaged in a fire. All three buildings are in various stages of study and/or restoration. In August 2018, the Bedford Alum Springs Hotel was acquired by Liberty University for an estimated $642,000.

Early life  Swanstr√∂m was born in St. Olai congregation in Norrk√∂ping. Little is known of her life before she was accepted for the Royal Dramatic Theatre school in 1890 when she was seventeen. Already in school her acting ability was acknowledged by her performance in two student plays. In 1892 she left the Royal Dramatic Theater school and was employed by The Royal Dramatic Theater and was in the ensemble for five years. In 1897 Karin Swanstr√∂m went from the Royal Dramatic Theater to Selander Company, that was run by Hjalmar and Concordia Selander, for a year and then she went to Swedish Theater Company in Helsinki in 1899.  Career  When she came back to Sweden from Helsinki in 1904 she started her own theater company, Karin Swanstr√∂m Theater Company, that was active and run by Swanstr√∂m until the early 1920s. She now began teaching acting in Stockholm and did this during the years 1921-25Winquist, Sven G., Torsten Jungstedt, \\"Svenskt filmsk√•despelarlexikon\\", Stockholm: Forum, 1973, p.814 and at the same time she began acting in silent films with Maurtiz Stiller's De landsflyktige in 1921. The critics loved the film and Swanstr√∂m, one wrote \\" as the most beautiful middle aged lady with the greatest scenic routine that you can find\\". Two years after this Karin Swanstr√∂m became head of production at Bonnierfilm, and in the same year she directed her first film, but it was for AB Svensk Filmindustri, or SF. =Boman p√• utst√§llningen= This film, which translates roughly to Boman at the Fair, is a comedy that takes place during the fair in Gothenburg, in 1923. Swanstr√∂m had to share her directing credit with the screenwriter Oscar Rydqvist, but \\"his part in directing the film was more a title than having any say during production\\".√Öhlander, Lars, ed., \\"Svensk filmografi. 2, 1920-1929\\", Stockholm: Svenska filminstitutet, 1982, p. 190 It received even reviews it was said that the film was neither bad or good, it had good, even great, moments but it also had bad parts as a \\"slow tempo\\" because of the \\"large number of attraction shots\\". It was also seen as being \\"silly\\", these attraction shots were of the fair, the film was also seen as an excuse for documenting the fair in Gothenburg. After Boman at the Fair, she went on to star in six silent films and two of them were The Saga of Gosta Berling part one and two. Of these six films, only two that were produced by Bonnierfilm, so being head of production didn't stop her from taking jobs with competing studios. But her busiest year was 1925. Not only was she teaching acting, but she was also directing two film and had two films coming out at the same time. =Kalle Utter= Kalle Utter was Swanstr√∂m's second film, and in it she was the only one credited as director. In Stockholm the film became a critical success; a critic in the newspaper Arbetaren (The Worker) wrote \\" We have never heard a heartwarming laughter in a cinema and when the picture ended the applauses was forceful and long ‚Äì a triumph that is rare.\\" The famous Stockholm critic Robin Hood wasn't less enthusiastic \\" Swedish film is rehabilitated! [...] It might sound strange to call Kalle Utter a woman's film, because Anders de Wahl has the leading role and is to all concerned in the picture from beginning to end. But for us de Wahl isn't the central character, but ‚Äì Karin Swanstr√∂m\\"√Öhlander, Lars, ed., \\"\\"Svensk filmografi. 2, 1920-1929\\"\\", Stockholm: Svenska filminstitutet, 1982, p. 238-239 Robin Hood did celebrate Swanstr√∂m for her acting but doesn't mention that she's the film's director or on her directing ability's. But Robin Hood wasn't the only one who gave Swanstr√∂m special attention, Jens Flik from NDA wrote \\"to adapt the rich experience, that she brings from the stage to tackle cinema's own demands as an art form. You can only hope that, Mrs.Swanstr√∂m is for the future hired more often than now as a director, it would do our domestic pictures a whole lot of good.\\" The only negative review that was all bad was one that when out of its way to explain how and why the lead actor Anders de Wahl was so bad in the picture and how bad he was as a movie actor. =Flying Dutchmen (Flygande Holl√§ndren)= Flying Dutchmen got a cold reception when it came out. Hjalmar Bergman was seen as a weak point as the adapter of his own book. The story was deemed pale, circumstantial, unfocused and lose in composition.√Öhlander, Lars, ed., \\"Svensk filmografi. 2, 1920-1929\\", Stockholm: Svenska filminstitutet, 1982, p. 254-255 Several critics remarked that the picture was more theatrical than cinematic, but one critic wrote \\"Karin Swanstr√∂m direction was because of explainable reasons not able to make any miracles with this Bergmansk screenplay, but you can trace her ambitious work, which is best shown in the details, and that's never wrong\\". Flying Dutchmen was the first film for Karin Swanstr√∂m for the new studio Skandinavisk film, the name was new but the studio grounds wasn't Skandinavisk film had take over Bonnierfilms studios. Swanstr√∂m was also the head of production for this studio as well. In 1926, something new happened to Karin Swanstr√∂m: she got her own comedy series at Oscarsteatern (The Oscars Theater) in Stockholm and it lasted from 1926 until 1931. =Girl in Tails (Flickan i frack)= This is Karin Swanstr√∂m's last film that she directed, and it's one of her finest films. But the critics were not as positive, but not all bad. \\"Many found the film as a happy and easy-going summer film and cheerfully bizarre.\\" There was also a feeling that the climax with the confrontation at the ball wasn't as shocking as they thought it was going to be, and there were people who felt the film was paler in comparison too the book. But the critics praised Magda Holm, who played the title role of Katja, for her acting and expressiveness.  Sound Era  After Girl in Tails, Swanstr√∂m kept on acting in theater and films. In July 1934, she was employed by AB Svensk Filmindustri and soon became a producer, then she was an artistic adviser, and then production manager.

The Yankee Blade was built in 1854 to transport gold, passengers, and cargo between Panama and San Francisco, California, during the California Gold Rush.Belyk, R. C. (2001). Great Shipwrecks of the Pacific Coast. New York: Wiley. The ship wrecked in fog off of Point Arguello in Southern California on October 1, 1854. The shipwreck cost an estimated 30 to 40 lives. A side-lever engine powered Yankee Blade.  Transit routes during the California Gold Rush  As soon as the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill became known in 1848, many people wished to travel to California to mine for gold. At that time, there were three main routes for people from the eastern United States to travel to California. The first route was via overland travel, which was expensive, dangerous, and took a long time. Another route involved sailing approximately fourteen thousand miles around Cape Horn in South America. Though this way was faster and sometimes less expensive, the route was no less dangerous, as the weather in the south was often harsh and unforgiving. In addition to the dangers present on both routes, the journey by land could very often take over six months, and the sea route, though faster, could still take over three months to complete. The third and fastest route involved sailing via steamship to Panama, hiking through the jungle on the Isthmus, and then sailing again from the coast of Panama to San Francisco. Though this route cut the time of the sea journey down to less than six weeks, the lack of ships between Panama and San Francisco could often lead to significant waiting times for passengers in Panama. It was to fill this untapped market of transportation between Panama and California that the Yankee Blade was built.  Construction and design  The SS Yankee Blade was built to carry gold, passengers, and cargo on the second leg of the journey between San Francisco and New York, via the Isthmus of Panama. The Yankee Blade was built as one of the most luxurious ships in the Independent Line fleet, with larger, square portholes, bathrooms, and a ship's surgeon whose services were free for the passengers. The ship was built as one of the fastest at the time, her side-lever engine, a more powerful but less efficient design over the less compact walking beam type engines, propelled the ship to a cruising speed of around thirteen knots. The Yankee Blade was commanded by Captain Henry Randall, who had worked for a competitor of the Independent Line, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, until his retirement two years before in 1852. Captain Randall was in command of the Yankee Blade for its entire life up until the sinking.  Last voyage  The Yankee Blade left San Francisco for Panama on what would be her final voyage on September 30, 1854. The ship held an estimated $153,000 worth of gold, as well as additional valuables passengers had entrusted to the ships purser. The official ship's manifest stated that there were 819 passengers, although due to tickets purchased last minute and the presence of stowaways, the true number of people on-board was much higher, with estimates of up to 1,200 people. Also leaving San Francisco for Panama was the steamship Sonora, with whom it is probable the captain of the Yankee Blade was engaged in an unofficial race. On the previous day, the Daily Alta California had an advertisement alleging a $5,000 bet that the Yankee Blade would beat the Sonora to Panama. Once both ships had left the confines of the San Francisco Bay, the Sonora headed out to sea to take the longer but safer route well offshore, away from any dangerous navigational hazards. Meanwhile, the Yankee Blade set off on a route which hugged the California coast, a route that was far more dangerous due to the high risk of striking various hazards along the coast.  Shipwreck  As the Yankee Blade steamed down the coast, it passed the coastal steamer Southerner headed for San Francisco. Concerned with the apparently reckless course taken by the Yankee Blade, the Captain of the Southerner hailed Captain Haley of the steamship Goliah, requesting that the Goliah watch for the Yankee Blade in case of the Yankee Blade running aground and requiring assistance. Although the Goliah began following the path of the Yankee Blade, the ship soon encountered thick fog banks and reduced speed for safety. The Yankee Blade also soon encountered thick fog, but unlike Captain Haley, Captain Randall did not order a change in speed or course. Shortly after 3PM on Sunday, the Yankee Blade struck a rock pinnacle approximately one mile offshore. The resulting collision tore a twelve-foot gash in the ship's hull beneath the waterline near the stern. Firmly wedged on the rock, the forward part of the ship was driven almost sixty feet from the water by the force of the crash. However, the stern of the ship was underwater and under constant pounding from the surf, causing a fear among the officers that the ship could break in two. Soon the ship's lifeboats were lowered with the task of ferrying the passengers to shore. In a move that was later found to be very controversial, Captain Randall himself took command of one of the lifeboats, leaving his unqualified teenage son in charge of the ship. Though Captain Randall would later claim to have been seeking a safe landing for the passengers, conflicting claims confuse whether Captain Randall returned to the wreck. It is known that he spent the night on shore while most passengers were still on board the wreck.  Rescue  The next day, the Goliah was still slowly progressing along the coast when the ship came upon the forward remains of the Yankee Blade, still filled with the great majority of the ship's passengers. At great danger to his own ship, Captain Haley positioned the Goliah as close as possible to the remains of the Yankee Blade. A line was set up between the two ships, and a lifeboat from the Goliah was soon ferrying the survivors from the wreck, a process which took the majority of the day. Soon after the last survivor was removed, the remains of the bow of the Yankee Blade slipped from the rock and sank. Due to the lack of space on board, the Goliah was forced to leave around three hundred survivors ashore, where they joined the others. The Goliah then dropped off its passengers in Santa Barbara, San Pedro, and San Diego before returning (though two days later due to grounding on a sandbar off of San Diego) to retrieve the survivors and return them to San Francisco.

Opercular plates of Rehderella are distinctive in the scutum and tergum of each side fusing in young stages. A slight step in basal margin marks the former articulation between plates. Scutal adductor scar is deep and narrow, depressor pit indistinct. Tergal depressor crests 6-8, distinct, depending from basal margin. Soft part distinctions include card setae on cirri develop only after animal reaches a size of 5 mm. Caudal appendages are present, growing longer with age, up to 20 segments in large specimens. = Synonymy and nomenclature =  Rehderella  * Rehderella , 1987: 327; (original description): , 2006: 85; (discussion). * Type species: Chthamalus belyaevi , 1973: 187 by original designation.

Whelk predation sets lower environmental limits. During times of calm seas, colonies can be exposed to air and sun for extended periods. In this upper zone, dominance is shared by the gastropod Nodolittorina pyramidalis pascua, an algal grazer. Near the base of the barnacle zone, another grazer, Nerita morio becomes more common, along with other fauna.

The building was constructed in 1918 to serve as the Mattoon office of the Railway Express Agency. The Railway Express Agency provided rail express shipping services to Mattoon's citizens, allowing them to ship money and packages along Mattoon's two major railways, the Illinois Central Railroad and Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis (Big Four). The agency formed in 1917, when the federal government ordered that all existing express services consolidate into a single service; this measure ensured consistent shipping of goods during World War I. The agency shipped goods to and from Mattoon until 1964, when the Big Four went bankrupt; the building served as a freight depot until 1971. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 1994. It fell into disrepair due to disuse, however, and was demolished in July 2013. It was delisted in 2020.

Fordell Castle was built in 1567, but it was built on the site of a previous structure. John Henderson (d. 1683) was created a baronet in 1664. The Hendersons' considerable wealth came from coalpits on their estates.Notes on Fordell Railway, built to serve the Henderson coalpitsNotes on Alice Pit, Fordell Colliery Life Sir John Henderson was the son of Robert Henderson (d. 1781), the 4th baronet.

Early in his career Henderson was associated with Henry Dundas and supported William Pitt the Younger, but Dundas threw his support to William Wemyss in 1787 and Henderson never forgave him for it. In 1791 he supported his cousin Andrew Cochrane,Henderson's mother was Isabella Stuart, daughter of Archibald Stuart of Torrance; her sister Jane was Andrew Cochrane's mother. but in 1796 he campaigned vigorously but unsuccessfully against him. In an effort to keep unfavorable votes from being cast, Sir John Henderson intimidated voters and imprisoned the Provost and some other unfavorable voters.A series of original portraits and caricature etchings, Volume 2, Part 2, John Kay, Edinburgh: Hugh Paton, Carver, and Gilder, 1838, p. 400-410Henderson, Ebenezer (1879) ‚Äú The Annals of Dunfermline and Vicinity‚Äù pp. 534-535; Kilrounie (5th ed. 1901) ‚ÄúThe Kingdom: A Descriptive and Historical Handbook to Fife‚Äù p. 139.

An adaptive filter is a filter that adapts its transfer function to changes in signal properties over time by minimizing an error or loss function that characterizes how far the filter deviates from ideal behavior. The adaptation process is based on learning from a sequence of signal samples and is thus an online algorithm. A nonlinear adaptive filter is one in which the transfer function is nonlinear. Kernel adaptive filters implement a nonlinear transfer function using kernel methods. In these methods, the signal is mapped to a high-dimensional linear feature space and a nonlinear function is approximated as a sum over kernels, whose domain is the feature space. If this is done in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, a kernel method can be a universal approximator for a nonlinear function. Kernel methods have the advantage of having convex loss functions, with no local minima, and of being only moderately complex to implement. Because high-dimensional feature space is linear, kernel adaptive filters can be thought of as a generalization of linear adaptive filters. As with linear adaptive filters, there are two general approaches to adapting a filter: the least mean squares filter (LMS) and the recursive least squares filter (RLS).

Under current U.S. law, only credit unions that are federally insured can join the FHLB system. Purpose The intent of the bill is to improve the U.S. housing market by reducing regulatory requirements to community credit unions. Some privately insured credit unions that serve public servants and small businesses have not been allowed to apply to the FHLB system Background As of 2014, approximately 132 small credit unions, located among nine states, are insured by a mutual insurance company instead of the federal government. Although federal government insurance for credit unions began in 1970, some small credit unions remained privately insured.

On the 18th, a French attack pushed back the Austrians a short distance. After more fighting, a powerful assault on the 22nd forced the entire Austrian army to withdraw to Wissembourg. The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the Wars of the French Revolution. Froeschwiller is a village in Bas-Rhin department of France, situated about north of Strasbourg. The Austrian victory in the First Battle of Wissembourg threatened to overrun the territory of Alsace. Hoche assumed command of the Army of the Moselle and attacked the Prussian army in the Battle of Kaiserslautern without success. However, the French took advantage of the lack of cooperation between the Prussians and their Austrian allies. Hoche sent 12,000 troops under Alexandre Camille Taponier through the Palatinate Forest to attack Wurmser's right flank at Froeschwiller. On 22 December, Hoche launched a successful assault with five divisions while Pichegru's Army of the Rhine attacked Wurmser from the south.

The character is based on the historical king Malcolm III of Scotland, and is derived largely from the account in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of Britain. He is the elder son of King Duncan, the heir to the throne, and brother to Donalbain. In the end, he regains the throne after mustering support to overthrow Macbeth. Role in the play Malcolm, like his father (King Duncan), represents order. He first appears in Act I, scene 2 (1.2), where he is talking to a sergeant, with Duncan about Macbeth's exploits on the field of battle. Malcolm later appears in Act 1.4 talking about the execution of the former Thane of Cawdor with Duncan. Macbeth then enters and receives congratulations for his victory. In Act 1.4, Duncan declares Malcolm to be his heir (\\"We will establish our estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland\\" - Duncan, Act 1.4 37-39). This act frustrates Macbeth. Malcolm is a guest at Macbeth's castle when Macbeth kills Malcolm's father, Duncan, in Act 2.2. Malcolm and his brother are informed of the death in Act 2.3. Because they are suspected of the murder, Malcolm is not immediately declared the king. Under suspicion and implicit threat, he and his brother decide to flee Scotland after the murder. While Donalbain flees to Ireland, Malcolm flees to England (\\"To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.\\" - Malcolm Act 2.3 138-39; \\"To Ireland I; our separated fortune Shall keep us both safer. Where we are There's daggers in men's smiles;\\" - Donalbain, Act 2.3 140-2). Their flight heightens their suspicion (\\"Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons, Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed.\\" - Macduff, Act 2.4 25-27), while Macbeth assumes their father's throne. In Act 4.1, Macbeth sees three apparitions summoned by the Three Witches, with Malcolm's Act 5.4 approach to the Dunsinane Castle with tree branches being the final one.Gill, p. xix. Act 4.3 presents irony with Macduff needing to prove his loyalty and Malcolm needing to prove his worthiness. In Act 4.3, Malcolm talks to Macduff about his loyalties and what to do. Upon hearing Macduff cast aspersions upon Macbeth (\\"Not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top Macbeth.\\" - Macduff, Act 4.3 55-57), Malcolm feigns his own vices to further test Macduff. Macduff responds that he too would have such vices if he were king and then signals his loyalty to Scotland (\\"O Scotland, Scotland!\\" - Macduff, Act 4.3 100). They concur that maybe no one is fit to rule such a fine land. This leads Malcolm to trust Macduff (\\"Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor.\\" - Malcolm, Act 4.3 114- 17). Upon news that Macduff's family was slain, Malcolm urges Macduff to take arms with him against Macbeth (\\"Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\\" - Malcolm, Act 4.3 228-229). Macduff agrees it is time to seek vengeance (\\"Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my sword's length set him. If he 'scape, Heaven forgive him too!\\" - Macduff, Act 4.3 233-35) as the scene ends. In the scene Malcolm learns that manhood is more than aggression when Macduff tells him that he must also grieve for his loss (\\"Dispute it like a man.\\" - Malcolm, Act 4.3 220; \\"I shall do so, / But I must also feel it as a man.\\" - Macduff, Act 4.3 220-21). Malcolm raises an army in England, and marches on Scotland with Macduff to reclaim his birthright from Macbeth. The Scottish noblemen lend their support to restore order to the land after observing Macbeth's extreme behaviour. In Act 5.4, Malcolm confers with Englishman Siward (the Elder) and his officers about strategies for obscuring their forces (\\"Let very soldier hew him down a bough And bear't before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us.\\" - Malcolm, 5.4 4-7) and about Macbeth's defence plans (\\"We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before't.\\" - Siward, 5.4 8-10). In Act 5.6, the battle commences as Malcolm, Macduff and Siward command forces against Dunsinane Castle. In Act 5.8 Malcolm and Siward storm Macbeth's castle. Siward receives news that his son was slain. Malcolm consoles him with an opportunity to grieve. Macduff enters with Macbeth's head and declares Malcolm the King (\\"Hail, King! for so thou art: behold, where stands Th' usurpers cursed head.\\" - Macduff, 5.8 54-55). Malcolm takes over as king and notes that order has been restored and that his intentions are good (\\"by the grace of Grace We will perform in measure, time, and place:\\" - Malcolm, Act 5.8 72-73). He invites everyone to his coronation. Critical comments Sylvan Barnet described Malcolm as \\"chaste, trustworthy, and patriotic\\". As the natural heir to the throne, Malcolm is Macbeth's foremost rival. He and his allies are \\"God's soldiers\\" and their eventual victory marks a restoration of moral order according to Barnet. After deposing Macbeth and resuming his rightful place, Malcolm delivers the final words of the play as a speech contrasting himself and the former tyrant. During his final speech, he grants earldoms to Macduff and others, while reclaiming his birthright.Gibson, et al., p. xii. The ending of Macbeth is often viewed as anticlimactic or at least failing to meet expectations, because Macbeth is killed by Macduff, rather than Malcolm or Fleance, who are perceived to have greater reasons to seek vengeance.Thompson, Introduction.

Specifically, gender disparities imply that one sex is disadvantaged over the other in experiences and outcomes. Education disparities can be seen in different enrollment rates, dropout rates, and survival rates among the sexes. Often these phenomena happen together. This can also include a difference in the quality of education received. In Kenya, gender disparities in education may be created or perpetuated by policy, ethnicity, region, religion, and age. Overall performances and transition rates Enrollment in education has greatly increased in Kenya over the years. During the last two decades of colonial rule, it is estimated that girls took up just 25% of all children enrolled in the workforce. In 1953, only one woman, or 6% of all students, achieved post- secondary education. Since then, according to a UNICEF study, enrollment has increased and the gender gap has reduced in size. UNICEF estimates as of 2012, 83.2% of youth (ages 15‚Äì24), are literate. In 1973, the girls made up only 43% of total primary school enrollment. In the educationally advanced districts, this proportion was close to 50%, while in the districts in the pastoral areas and coast province it was below 32%. UNICEF states females actually show slightly higher enrollment than males in primary school, 84.5% enrollment compared to 83.5% for boys. In addition, overall survival rate to the last year of primary school is a high 96.1%. However the relationship between male and female enrollment switches and widens in secondary education. In secondary school, 51.6% of enrolled students are male and 48.4% are female. UNICEF reports that the greatest gender disparity exists among the poorest quintile group of Kenya, with attendance rates being 33.1% and 25% for males and females respectively. What is very clear is that there is a distinct difference in rates of enrollment for females in certain districts, with the highest district, Kirinyaga enrolling 51.8% of its girls in school and the lowest district, Wajir, only enrolling 13.9% of its girls. Regional and ethnic disparities The demographics of Kenya include are over 43 ethnic tribes. In recent years, violent ethnic conflict has come to the attention of the media especially because of the 2007-08 Kenyan crisis, however it is believed by many that this violence represents a larger problem in Kenya: uneven and combined development that leads to uneven resources and outcomes among its ethnic groups. Kenyan regions were determined by the British Empire during colonization to reflect ethnic differences, and enrollment in different levels of education varies by region as a result. Regional differentiation has been linked to uneven capitalist development that occurred in Kenya in the first half of the twentieth century. Some regions were chosen as central regions, and periphery regions were given different, lesser functional roles, resulting in different outcomes and accentuating ethnic difference. This regional differentiation, meant to create a class of capitalist farmers to replace the peasants during colonization, created disparities between the rural workers and the poorest marginal group. =History of ethnic and regional disparities= Before 1900, Christian Missionaries set up schools mostly along the east coast of Kenya, before swiftly moving inland. The main missionary settlements were in the present Central Province (Kenya), Eastern Province (Kenya), Western Province (Kenya), and Nyanza Province, particularly in the Central and Western Province; there were very few settlements in the Rift Valley Province and parts of Coast Province. This lowered concentration of schools in these districts continued over the decades. thumbleft220pxProvinces of Kenya { width=\\"100%\\" border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\"  1\\\\. Central 2\\\\. Coast 3\\\\. Eastern 4\\\\. Nairobi  5\\\\. North Eastern 6\\\\. Nyanza 7\\\\. Rift Valley 8\\\\. Western } The tribes that were penetrated most deeply by the initial missionary spring in the 1920s were the Luo, Luhya, Kikuyu, Embu, Meru, and Kamba. The Luo and Kikuyu were the first tribes to embrace Western systems, including education and are also the groups that have advanced most greatly socio-economically along the tribes. Other tribes like the Kalenjin, who lived in the Rift valley, previously mentioned to have had less missionary presence, were slower to jump onto the Western education bandwagon because of their regional disadvantage. The spreading of education in Kenya was a political one as all tribes initially resisted the presence of missionary force until they realized the socio-economic benefits. Education was a way to escape the forced labor and unfair market conditions under colonial presence. As Kinyanjui goes on to say, over time the different tribes decided to take more power over their educational systems. The first to do so were the Kikuyu. It seems that as missionary presence intensified in an area, more initial protest and subsequent acceptance of Western education and tribal advancement happened. This phenomenon varied in strength in different regions. In regions that took longer to assimilate into Western countries and benefit from advanced schooling systems, the girls experienced greater education inequality. Kikuyu, Luo and other groups have benefited from this early educational influence experience greater academic achievement and female enrollment in the long term than in other tribes. =Perpetuation of ethnic and regional difference= Achievements in gender disparities in Kenya Because of dwindling land reserves, a higher stress has been put on formal education. The Kenyan government has also poured vast amounts of resources into educating the population, including introducing universal primary schooling. Education has increasingly become more valuable since more Kenyans have been able to get more middle and higher income jobs due to education. In addition, illegitimate post-colonial elections have perpetuated the socio-economic advancement of certain regions like the Central region, over others by elected officials. =Achievement in codified law= In 1972 the Law of Succession was enacted that requires equal access to property at death when the owner dies without a will. Challenges to gender equality =Ethnic, tribal, and family barriers= All four major tribes in Kenya (Kikuyu, Luo, Luyia, and Kamba) are polygynous, patrilineal, and usually patrilocal. For example, traditionally (before the 1972 Law of Succession) only male relatives could inherit land from their fathers in the Kikuyu, Luo, and Luyia tribes, with the exception of Kamba women being able to inherit from their husbands. However often women may not be able to assert their rights to inherit due to low literacy among women, expenses in court, and corruption. According to Cubbins, although females are increasingly more involved in the productive labor of their households, in rural areas they are mostly in charge of agriculture production that goes back into the households, whereas fathers mainly have control over the cash crops which have the economic power to support their children in school. Because women are more likely to invest their resources into their children's education, the traditional practice of males controlling cash crops poses significant concern for gender disparities in Kenya. One of the reasons the Kikuyus, the tribe to assimilate into Western education first, refused to enter into this formal education was because missionaries often put restrictions on groups who practiced female genital mutilation. This barrier kept Kenyans of many tribes from being able to access formal education from the missionaries. In some tribes, girls who receive formal education may be seen as breaking traditional tribal norms and rejecting the tribal lifestyle. As Lesorogol observed in the Samburu people, educated women may differentiate themselves by enforcing conceptual differences along the dimensions of knowledge/capabilities and morality/sexuality. Many times when educated women show knowledge of Swahili or English, the nation's national languages, or work outside the home, they are seen as showing off their superiority or not valuing traditional roles for women. Educated women may be viewed by their tribes, family members and greater society as \\"worldly\\", a definition that often comes with associated connotations like disrespectful, arrogant, or even promiscuous. =National barriers= Even though the Law of Succession was passed in 1972, women are still denied access to disputing these rights in court due to corruption, lack of knowledge of their rights under the law, and court fees. Government aid to rural areas where technical skill in agriculture may be high is often not very much. This contributes to a lower amount of resources parents can invest into their children's education, especially daughters. Women and children make up most of these households in rural areas, where fathers may be absent for long periods of time. Until 1979, Kenya required people to pay for the first 6 years of schooling, lowering the number of children enrolled in primary schools. Importance of mother education. Of those who were chosen, males were more likely to be chosen than girls. This early disparity inhibited the growth of women in education because women are more likely to invest resources into providing education for their daughters if they have also gotten an education. Consequences of gender inequality When denied access to formal education, girls may grow up illiterate and without the tools to gain the economic resources needed to invest in the education of the next generation of Kenyan women. In addition, education often prolongs marriage, and because marriage almost always means the end of education for a women, additional years of schooling can give a woman more opportunities to stay in school and gain economic tools before marriage. Girls who do not continue with school are also more likely to encounter forced marriages and the forceful practice of female genital mutilation. When women do go into education they are more likely to go into areas like teaching, law, and arts subjects over areas like science, engineering and medicine. Between 1980 and 1987, bachelor's degrees in education and arts accounted for between 63.7% and 67.6% of the total attained by women. Trends like this may lead to the narrow isolation of women into service and teaching jobs. Possible solutions =Increasing the number of female teachers= Beyond the primary school level, female teachers are significantly fewer in number than their male counterparts. Kenya represents a diverse group of religious groups. The second largest group is the Muslim group. Many Muslim families prefer for their daughters to be taught by females only and increasing the number of female teachers may subsequently increase female participation, as well as increasing the number of female administrators. For this to happen supplementary laws including those that protect maternity leave, equal pay, and discrimination in the workplace may have to be implemented. In the prestigious University of Nairobi, according to Chege and Sifuna, less than 20% of teachers are female. =Evening out regional disparities= Rural areas and the specific ethnic groups they compose suffer from disproportionately low resources in education and receive significantly less funds from the government. More schools with more female teachers could be created in rural areas and policies could be enacted to stem the surge of government funds to solely urban areas. =Increasing land and other economic resources to women= Since the land reform acts of the 1950s, it has been difficult for women to possess land, where before they had easy access through traditional kinship arrangements. Government aid has also been low to rural areas and has not directly benefited woman. According to Cubbins, men's education and women's education are both highly related to the education of both girls and boys, and so increasing general educational attainment should decrease gender disparities in education over time.

They possess around 30 body segments and reach about in length. Description Chordeumatidans are relatively short-bodied, with only 26-32 body segments behind the head. They range in length from . A key feature is the presence of 6 large bristles (setae) on the dorsal surface of each body segment. The first segment (collum) is relatively narrow, giving the appearance of a distinct \\"neck\\" in many species. The body tapers towards the rear, and the rearmost tip (telson) contains silk-producing organs (spinnerets). A dorsal groove runs down the length of the body, and some species possess paranota, lateral extensions of the exoskeleton. Paranota are also found in some other millipedes, notably Polydesmida, from which Chordeumatidans can be distinguished by having more than 20 body segments and a dorsal groove. Unlike most other helminthomorph (worm-like) millipedes, Chordeumatidans lack ozopores. Distribution Chordeumatidans have a large distribution, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. They are present in Madagascar but absent from sub-Saharan Africa and, aside from southern Chile, are largely absent from South America. They occur in the tropics of Central America, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, and as far south as Tasmania, New Zealand, and Chilo√© Island, Chile. They are abundant in cold, rocky, mountainous areas of Europe and central Asia, and range northward to Scandinavia, Siberia, and in North America up into Canada and southwest Alaska.

It operated between 1829 and 1839 as part of the Moreton Bay penal settlement. It is on the site now part of the Australia TradeCoast, previously the Eagle Farm Airport. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005. The site was listed on the Register of the National Estate and is also included on the Queensland Heritage Register. The site is historically important as one of a small number of convict sites remaining in Queensland with surviving original fabric (even though only as an archaeological deposit).Australian Heritage Database, Department of Environment, Australian Government History Female convicts sent to the Moreton Bay penal settlement (who, like the men, were double offenders) were originally housed in a women's gaol, or Female Factory, in Queen Street, Brisbane, on the site of the present General Post Office, Brisbane.History of Corrective Services in Queensland, Queensland Government. In September 1829 Commandant Patrick Logan of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement founded a secondary agricultural establishment at Eagle Farm approximately eight miles from Brisbane. One hundred and fifty men were deployed to clear the scrub. By January 1832 about were under cultivation with mostly maize and some potatoes, some cattle and pigs were also being raised. Working so near the Eagle Farm swamp caused a noticeable increase in malaria amongst the convicts, but despite calls for its abandonment, the farm was maintained. By 1836, had been cleared, but no more than were under cultivation. However the historical report by Paul Ashron and Sue Rosen suggests the area under cultivation was closer to .Ashton and Rosen in Higginbotham, Historical and archaeological assessment of the Eagle Farm agricultural establishment, female factory and prison, Eagle Farm, Brisbane, Queensland. Prangley in \\"The Eagle Farm agricultural establishment\\" was unable to be definitive on this issue, saying the amount of actual area under cultivation \\"remains unclear\\".Prangley, Dean Queensland History Journal, Vol. 21, No. 12, February 2013, The Royal Queensland Historical Society of Queensland ISSN 1836-5477 The impetus to move the women convicts from Queen Street to Eagle Farm was their proximity to the main male population in Brisbane, which led to sexual forays between the women and soldiers and officials of the colony, despite the high stone walls of the factory being topped with broken glass. These forbidden fraternisations intensely annoyed the penal colony's Commandant, Captain Foster Fyans. Women caught were put in solitary confinement in tiny cells, put in irons or had their heads shaved. Patrick McDonald was replaced as supervisor for having aided and abetted access by amorous constables. In August 1836 Fyans caught the colony's Chief Constable climbing over the walls by means of an \\"ingenious ladder\\", which prompted him to reduce the numbers of women in Brisbane Town to 14 of the oldest. There are conflicting reports about when the first female convicts started working at the farm and factory. The Queensland Heritage Register says by 1830, the Australian Heritage Database says by 1834. Prangley notes there is mention of three dairywomen in the work list for 1828, but these may have been associated with the principal colony farm at New Farm. All sources agree by 1836 there were 40 women, when conditions of the farm and factory were documented by the Quaker missionaries James Backhouse and George Walker. Women worked in the fields and in the prison, doing needlework, laundry, unpicking ropes and even in road construction. Several timber slab buildings included the farm superintendent's house, a two-room building for male prisoners who did heavy work, the Matron's Quarters, a female factory with four rooms and sundry separate buildings including a one-room store, a one-room school and a one room hospital. The cook house had two rooms, one being a needle room where prisoners worked at sewing. The actual prison where women were locked up at night was a building containing six cells with a tall stockade or pallisade type fence, the outer wall high poles, the tops of which were sharpened. Stationing female felons at Eagle Farm was an attempt to reduce fraternisation between the women and male convicts and the military, with the latter being forbidden to cross the bridge at Breakfast Creek. Despite these precautions, assignations were frequent, occurring in the long grass around the farm. In the first years of the penal settlement there was a substantial population of local Aborigines in the area, their numbers depending on the season. In April 1836 Dr Robertson, the penal surgeon, wrote of the long road between Brisbane and Eagle Farm passing through \\"the fishing ground of a tribe of aboriginal natives; at seasons of the year they are very dangerous and troublesome.\\"Brisbane: The Aboriginal Presence 1824-1860, Edited by Rod Fisher, Brisbane History Group Papers No. 11, 1992 This was at odds with the observations of Commandant Cotton the following year who wrote \\"the tribes which occupy the lands immediately adjacent to Brisbane Town, after an acquaintance of several years, come amongst us in confidence, a good understanding prevails between them and us‚Ä¶ These tribes were formerly extremely hostile‚Ä¶\\". By August 1836 the number of women at the original female factory in Queen Street had increased to 76. By the end of June 1836 the construction of strong slab cells at Eagle Farm was considered necessary and in 1837 all female prisoners in Brisbane Town were removed to Eagle Farm. By November 1838 the decision had been taken to abandon the Moreton Bay penal settlement and the numbers of convicts, both men and women, started declining rapidly as the penal settlement began to wind up. Plan of Female Factory, Brisbane Town, Moreton Bay 1837 By March 1839 the Eagle Farm Women's Prison and Factory consisted of a Supervisor's cottage with walls plastered internally and externally, with detached slab kitchen at rear. A two-roomed hut occupied by male convicts and two-roomed hut serving as matron's quarters, with another room under construction and a slab kitchen at rear. All were slab buildings including the Female Factory which comprised a number of four-roomed accommodation buildings; a store, a school, a hospital (plastered) and workhouse, each of one room; a two-roomed building housing the cook house and needle room; and a block of six cells. The area was surrounded by a double fence, the outer being a stockade of strut poles with sharp tops, high, long and deep. In May 1839 the remaining 57 convict women were shipped to Sydney and the penal settlement at Eagle Farm was effectively closed, becoming a government cattle station by 1841. In 1841 the superintendent's quarters were occupied by assistant surveyor Robert Dixon and then briefly by Stephen Simpson, Commissioner for Crown Lands. In 1842 the land was surveyed, put up for public auction and subsequently farmed. From the 1840s to the 1930s the land was used for mixed farming including citrus fruit, dairying, cattle grazing, and small crops. Aborigines were known to raid produce and dwellings in the vicinity of Brisbane including small farms from Breakfast Creek to Eagle Farm, mostly in the period 1845-54 after the penal settlement was closed down and the area was opened to white settlers. In 1850, 31 Aborigines armed with spears and waddies descended on Breakfast Creek and dug up the potatoes of Martin Frawley, the former convict miller turned farmer. The buildings on the women's prison site were demolished at an unknown date. The superintendent's house was thought to have survived until at least 1890. In 1922, the land was acquired by the Australian Government for an aerodrome, the Eagle Farm Airport. In 1925 a hangar was built for government use and in 1927 a hangar was built for Qantas. Aviation pioneers such as Charles Kingsford Smith, Charles Ulm, Bert Hinkler and Amy Johnson used the airport. The site ceased operation as an aerodrome in 1931, although it continued to be used for gliders. However, in World War II, the site was refurbished in 1942 as a major airbase for the US Pacific Military Command. This involved covering the site with fill of variable depth. After the war, in 1949 Eagle Farm became Brisbane's main airport, known as Brisbane Airport. In 1988 the airport closed again, aviation moving to the present Cribb Island site as Brisbane International Airport. The women's prison site then became an open grassed area. The site remains one of only six surviving in Brisbane from the convict period, with the former Moreton Bay penal settlement being one of only seven sites in Australia associated with secondary punishment.  Description  The old Eagle Farm airport, of which the site of the former Eagle Farm convict settlement forms part, is bounded on the south by Lamington Avenue and the Pinkenba Railway, to the east by Viola Place, to the west by the Gateway Arterial Road, to the north-west by a drainage channel and to the north-east by Lomandra Drive and Cassia Place. The land in the centre of the area is now flat and featureless, apart from remnant structures from WWII and the remains of runways from the post- war development of the airport. Virtually none of the old airport area exists as it did prior to European settlement. Only the foundations of the Eagle Farm Settlement survive, having been covered with fill in 1942. The Allison Engine Testing Stands and Second World War Hangar No. 7 from World War II also survived on the former airport site and are both separately heritage-listed.  Heritage listing  Eagle Farm Women's Prison and Factory Site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Eagle Farm Women's Prison and Factory Site is significant as one of few sites surviving in Brisbane from the convict period and a remnant of only seven sites associated with secondary punishment in Australia. Further, the Women's Prison and Factory Site is one of even fewer sites, both in Brisbane and in the national context, associated specifically with female felons. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Eagle Farm Women's Prison and Factory Site is significant as one of the earliest sites of building activity in Queensland, initial construction having occurred within 5 years of the establishment of the settlement of Brisbane Town. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Eagle Farm Women's Prison and Factory Site has potential to reveal substrata evidence of a number of factors including the administration of the convict system in the final years of transportation, the confinement and punishment of female convicts, building materials and construction technology and artefacts associated with the activities, occupations and social status of groups and individuals. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The establishment of the Eagle Farm Women's Prison and Factory Site is associated with early historical figures such as New South Wales Governor, Ralph Darling and Commandant Logan.

Produced at a time when the Republic of South Africa and its affiliated white-ruled regimes in Mozambique, Rhodesia, and Angola were relatively strong but politically isolated, the Manifesto called upon them to relinquish white supremacy and minority rule and singled out apartheid South Africa for violation of human rights. In the Manifesto, which was subsequently adopted both by the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations, thirteen Heads of State offered dialogue with the rulers of these Southern African states under the condition that they accept basic principles of human rights and human liberties. They also threatened to support the various liberation wars if negotiations failed. The Lusaka Manifesto represented one of two strategies to deal with white minority rule in Southern Africa: To try to contain violence, preserve the status quo, and improve the humanitarian situation little by little through diplomatic means, small reforms, and compromises. The other strategy, to wage independence wars, would eventually prevail. Background In the late 1960s South Africa's apartheid regime became increasingly politically isolated, both internationally and continental. Under Prime Minister B.J. Vorster it developed the so-called \\"outward-looking policy\\", an effort to bind southern African countries economically, and in this way to discourage them from openly criticising its repressive internal politics. This policy first was openly opposed only by Tanzania under president Julius Nyerere and Zambia under Kenneth Kaunda, but their lobbying made the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) reject any further dialogue with South Africa. At that time independence movements had been formed in all white-ruled territories of Southern Africa, either with an explicit commitment to guerrilla warfare and sabotage or recently having scaled their activities from passive resistance, petitioning, and lobbying to an openly armed struggle. The African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa had launched its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in 1961. It immediately executed several sabotage acts against the country's infrastructure. In South- West Africa SWAPO's paramilitary wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) was founded in 1962, its first military action occurred in Omugulugwombashe in 1966. Yet South Africa was politically strong at the time of the declaration agreed upon in Lusaka. Its border states except Botswana were all ruled by white minorities. In the United States, National Security Study Memorandum number 39, issued by president Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, had just reiterated that \\"the Whites in southern Africa [are] there to stay\\". Memorandum 39, nicknamed Tar baby memorandum for its reluctant acceptance of apartheid and minority rule in order to gain anti- communist allies in Southern Africa, strengthened South Africa's position internationally. Prime Minister Vorster had had a secret conversation with Kaunda for some time since 1968, eventually leading to the Manifesto. A threat to reveal existence and content of this conversation was issued by Vorster to influence Kaunda's public presentation of South African politics. When Kaunda did not react, Vorster published the complete exchange and later in 1970 confirmed it in the South African parliament. Content The Manifesto starts with a declaration on human rights and equality and specifically rejects racial discrimination, both the then existing White minority racism against Blacks and discrimination by Blacks against Whites, a widespread fear of the White minorities at that time. It further offers dialogue to the White regime in South Africa, stating that the signatories would \\"negotiate rather than destroy, talk rather than kill\\". For Namibia, Mozambique, Rhodesia and Angola the Manifesto called for self-determination and the establishment of majority rule. For South Africa its tone was sharper, and its recommendations went much further, including the suggestion to expel South Africa from all international political and economic bodies. This distinction between the suggested treatment of South Africa and the other white-ruled territories also contained an acknowledgement of South Africa's status as an independent, sovereign UN member, while Namibia, Mozambique, Rhodesia and Angola were colonies without recognition as states. Significance The significance of the Lusaka Manifesto has been compared to that of the Magna Carta and the Freedom Charter. The liberalism expressed in it was in direct opposition to South African apartheid which saw rights and liberties of individual people as tantamount to communism, and as irreconcilable with its own nationalist policies. The Manifesto was published in Britain in form of an advertisement, paid for by the Zambian government, in The Times and The Guardian. It was endorsed by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and by the 24th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie at the opening of the 7th session of the OAU rastaites.com , 2 September 1970 The OAU issued several other documents after the Lusaka Manifesto that concerned the situation in South Africa, for instance the Mogadishu Declaration of 1970 and the Dar es Salaam Declaration of 1974. They were mainly updates, without a real diversion from the Manifesto general direction, although, in reaction to South Africa's complete rejection of the original document, they are written in a decisively tenser tone and stress much more the support of armed liberation movements. Reception North America and former colonial powers in Europe positively received the Lusaka Manifesto, reportedly \\"because Africa argued, not shouted\\". > The manifesto was a document in the moderate line of thought on how to > improve the situation of Blacks in Southern Africa. It acknowledged the > right of all the whites who had settled in southern Africa to stay there. It > recognized South Africa as a sovereign and independent state and proposed no > changes of boundaries. It advocated boycott and isolation, rather than armed > intervention or internal revolt, in South Africa. Above all, it urged > negotiation and accepted that change could not come overnight. The Lusaka Manifesto has been criticised for not involving any of the contemporary liberation movements and, more generally, of entrenching capitalism on the African continent rather than supporting the various socialist movements of that time. The White South African regime rejected the document. The ANC was likewise opposed to the Lusaka Manifesto as in their view the declaration legitimised the apartheid regime, pronouncing its status as a sovereign and independent UN-recognised entity. They further criticised that the call for a peaceful resolution came at a time South Africa intervened militarily in Rhodesia, and that the Manifesto's wording artificially separated the liberation struggles in South Africa, South-West Africa, and Rhodesia. In 1971 the ANC stated that: > It is a tragedy that now‚Äîwhen black South Africa is launching an > unflinching, full scale armed struggle against Vorster and his > henchmen‚ÄîAfrican States [...] have seen it fit to have a 'dialogue' with > white South Africa [...] If there should be a dialogue it should be between > Voster and the real leaders of the people, Mandela, Sisulu, Mbeki, Kathrada, > Fischer, Motsoaledi. ANC's main disappointment, though, was that its armed struggle, and that of its likeminded liberation movements FRELIMO, MPLA, SWAPO, ZANU, and ZAPU was not directly supported and rather seen as a possible future legitimate action, even if it already was in full swing. In the spirit of the Manifesto, Namibia conducted the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference between 1975 and 1977, an event widely criticised for providing \\"pseudo-reforms\\" entrenching the racial segregation of Namibia's population, and indirectly reinforcing the economic and political power of the white population. Several black delegates, however, welcomed the start of institutionalised communication between the parties. Rhodesia's Ian Smith entered into several round of talks with ZANU and ZAPU. These were, however, interspersed with military action, at times supported by South Africa. In 1975 the talks finally broke down, and the Frontline States supported armed liberation from 1976 onwards. Angola and Mozambique already were in a state of full-scale wars of independence, Angola since 1961 and Mozambique since 1964. The Manifesto made no difference to the developments in these countries. After a successful coup d'√©tat in Portugal on 24 April 1974 the Portuguese colonial power collapsed, and Portuguese colonies were allowed to establish majority-rule governments. This development encouraged liberation movements in other white-ruled territories as well. Following the Alvor Agreement in January 1975 Angola became independent in November, ending its war of independence but starting a devastating civil war. Mozambique likewise became independent in 1975 and saw its own civil war from 1977 to 1992. Aftermath Only a few years after the Lusaka Manifesto the buffer of white- ruled countries north of South Africa disintegrated rapidly, forcing the apartheid regime to take a different course of politics. Mid 1976 uprisings in Soweto and Gulguleto brought the country to the brink of a civil war. The Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), the predecessor of today's Southern African Development Community (SADC) was founded in 1980 in order to \\"reduce member states' dependence, particularly, but not only, on apartheid South Africa\\". The white rulers of South Africa eventually relinquished power to the black majority in 1994 but instead of acting on the moderate suggestions of the Manifesto faced independence wars in all affected countries.

They then met drummer Sean Huber and bassist Ian Farmer. Their name was inspired by a book that Lukens and Ewald found entitled ‚ÄúModern Baseball Techniques\\", which was owned by Ewald's father on the evening they decided to form a band. The quartet got their start playing house shows around Drexel University in the basement scene alongside bands like The Menzingers, Lee Hartney, Ted Nguyent and Cayetana. Huber and Farmer joined midway into the recording of the group's first album, which was recorded at Drexel's studios. That album, Sports, was released in 2012, and soon after the group left Drexel and Chestnut Hill temporarily to pursue music on a more regular basis. The group's second full-length album, You're Gonna Miss It All, was released on Run For Cover Records in 2014, reaching #97 on the Billboard 200.

The type species is Anzu wyliei. In 2015, the International Institute for Species Exploration names it as one of the \\"Top 10 New Species\\" for new species discovered in 2014. Description Life restoration Anzu wyliei is characterized by a toothless beak, a prominent crest, long arms ending in slender, relatively straight claws, long powerful legs with slender toes, and a relatively short tail. Anzu measured about to long, up to tall at the hips and to in weight, and was the largest North American oviraptorosaur, though the Mongolian genus Gigantoraptor was larger than Anzu. When the type specimen of Anzu was described, several autapomorphies (derived traits unique to a genus) were established. There is a high crescent-like crest on the skull, formed by the upper branches of the praemaxillae. The occipital condyle is wider than the foramen magnum. The front part of the lower jaw, which is fused with its counterpart, has a prominent flange on its outer side. The retroarticular process, a prominent projection at the rear of the lower jaw, is elongated, about as long as the jaw joint surface. The lower end of the radius is divided into two rounded processes. The first phalanx of the second finger has a trough along the lower edge of its inner side. The front side of the astragalus (ankle bone) has a tubercle at the base of its ascending process. An additional four possible autapomorphies were identified in the referred specimens. The main body of the maxilla has no depression around the antorbital fenestra. The nasal branch of the maxilla is elongated and constructed like an inverted L. The branch of the jugal towards the quadratojugal is vertically deep. The same branch is forked at its rear end. History of discovery Map of locations yielding Anzu specimens (stars) Several large skeletons from the late Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of Montana and South Dakota were initially referred to as \\"cf. Chirostenotes\\",Varricchio, D. J. (2001). Late Cretaceous Oviraptorosaur (Theropoda) dinosaurs from Montana. Mesozoic Vertebrate Life. D. H. Tanke and K. Carpenter. Bloomington, Indiana University Press: 42‚Äì57. though more recent studies concluded that they represent new species. In 1998 Fred Nuss of Nuss Fossils discovered the site containing the Holotype CM 7800. The first two partial skeletons of Anzu were discovered in 1998 by Fred Nuss Fossils on a private South Dakota ranch. The two specimens weren't buried together ‚Äì the skeletons rested about 330 feet apart with the second individual in a rock layer about 11 feet below the first ‚Äì but, once prepped by the commercial outfit Triebold Paleontology, it was clear that both represented the same dinosaur. Both were mostly disarticulated and appeared to have been transported by a water current. A third referred specimen, fragmentary skeleton MRF 319, studied by Tyler Lyson of the National Museum of Natural History, was discovered by Scott Haire, who spotted the bones at his uncle's ranch at Marmarth, North Dakota. A rear lower jaw fragment, FMNH PR 2296, was also referred. These four fossils found at Hell Creek together make up a fairly complete skeleton of Anzu wyliei, comprising about 75 to 80 per cent of the whole skeleton. Three researchers, Emma Schachner of the University of Utah, Matthew Lamanna of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and Tyler Lyson of the Smithsonian in Washington realized in 2006 that they each had partial skeletons of the same species and began collaborating to study it, assisted by Hans-Dieter Sues, a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. The main fossils are being held at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. Illustrations of selected elements of the two specimens held at Carnegie Museum (CM 78000 and CM 78001) The genus is notable as the first well- preserved example of a North American oviraptorosaur. According to Sues, \\"for almost a hundred years, the presence of oviraptorosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton, and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery. With the discovery of A. wyliei, we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs.\\" The creature's appearance ‚Äì \\"big crests on their skulls, a beak, no teeth, and a very bird-like skeleton\\" ‚Äì and its discovery in the Hell Creek Formation led to it being jokingly nicknamed the \\"chicken from hell\\". Matthew Lamanna, who devised the species' name, originally wanted to use a Latin or Greek version of \\"chicken from hell\\". However, he found that this nickname does not translate well in those languages, so he eventually settled on evoking and using the name of the bird-like daemon Anzu from the mythology of ancient Sumer, which itself roughly translates to \\"heavenly eagle\\".Alster, B. (1991). Contributions to the Sumerian lexicon. Revue d'Assyriologie et d'arch√©ologie orientale, 85(1): 1-11. The specific name, wyliei, honors Wylie J. Tuttle, the grandson of one of the museum's donors, Lee B. Foster. Phylogeny Referred specimen MRF 319 Anzu was placed in the Oviraptorosauria, as a member of the Caenagnathidae. A cladistic analysis showed it was a possible sister species of Caenagnathus. It had been expected that oviraptorosaurs would be found in North America, as well as the documented specimens in Asia, as the two continents had a land connection during the Cretaceous, but the discovery of Anzu wyliei indicates that North American oviraptorosaurs were related more closely to each other than to their counterparts in Asia. Paleobiology Photos of the skull elements of the Carnegie specimens Anzu was probably an omnivore or herbivore, although the beak is not as heavily constructed as in the Asian Oviraptoridae. Other differences from its Asian cousins include size ‚Äì the Asian Oviraptoridae were smaller ‚Äì as well as thicker legs and different lower jaws. The fossils of Anzu wyliei were found in mudstone rock that had once been part of ancient floodplains. This indicates that the species likely had a lifestyle significantly different from its Asian counterparts, which lived in arid or semi-arid conditions. Its lifestyle, according to Stephen Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, was that of \\"a fast-running, ecological generalist that didn't quite fit the usual moulds of meat-eating or plant-eating dinosaur.\\" Its jaw morphology suggests that it could eat a variety of food items, including vegetation, small animals, and possibly eggs. Reconstructed head and neck While a number of its features were similar to those of modern birds, it was not an avian dinosaur and its line died out in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, along with all the rest of the non-avian dinosaurs. Its bird-like features are instead an example of convergent evolution. Matthew Lamanna comments that \\"it would have had a lot of birdy behaviors. When people think of a dinosaur, they think of something like a T. rex or a brontosaurus, and when they think of a bird, they think of something like a sparrow or a chicken. This animal, Anzu, has a mosaic of features of both of those groups, and so it basically provides a really nice link in the evolutionary chain.\\" The purpose of Anzu's large crest is unclear; Sues notes that it \\"is very large and made of paper-thin bone, so it was not able to take much stress. All oviraptosaurs have this crest but it is certainly the largest in A. wyliei. The most likely function is for display, showing off to members of your own species. The Australian cassowary has a similar crest which is thought to be used to attract mates, so it is possible that A. wyliei could have used its crest in a similar fashion.\\" The fossils showed evidence of injuries, including a healed broken rib and an arthritic toe that was probably the result of a tendon being ripped away from the bone (an avulsion fracture). It is not known whether this indicates that the animals fought each other, or were injured by predators.

Life and career  Doggett grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. She graduated from Sophie Newcomb College (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA) in 1952 and Yale University School of Art and Architecture in 1956 with an MFA in graphics, where she worked under noted colorist Josef Albers, who had recently been appointed Head of Yale's Graphic Design department. \\"As an early student of Josef Albers, she took his famed Interaction of Color course and absorbed Albers‚Äô inspired principles of color perception while establishing her own strong artistic identity.\\" Her first job after graduate school was with George Nelson, working on the anthropological part of the permanent exhibit at Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia. She then worked in Europe for the magazine Architectural Record, photographing architects and engineers and their work. Her first airport design job was for the Memphis airport in 1959. The project's architect Roy Harrover knew Doggett from both Nashville and Yale and brought her in to do the graphics. Her first innovation was the development of a standardized font for use throughout the airport. This font became Doggett's trademarked ‚ÄúAlphabet A‚Äù and was used in many subsequent airport projects, since it was very readable over long distances. Additional airport projects included Tampa International, George Bush-Houston, Baltimore-Washington, Newark, Miami, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, and Cleveland-Hopkins among others. As of 2014, Doggett had designed wayfinding systems for 40 major airport projects, which is said to be ‚Äúmore than any other designer in the world.‚Äù Each year, 20 million airplane passengers are guided by her way-finding signage and graphics. Doggett is credited with four innovations that are now commonly employed in airports and other large public spaces: * Use of color, letter, and symbol to guide visitors through large unfamiliar places. * Designs that begin on highways outside the structure, simplifying and making the wayfinding process safer for drivers or other travelers while also reducing the number of signs needed. Doggett's system eliminated two-thirds of the highway signs that had originally been proposed for the Tampa airport. * Building the verbal or symbolic message into the architecture rather than tacking it on as a sign. * Creating a visual symbol to brand the airport and represent it as a gateway to the surrounding region.

The campaign criticizes the use of the word \\"bossy\\" to describe assertive girls and women, proposing that the word is stigmatizing and may discourage girls and women from seeking positions of leadership.  Promotion  Sponsored primarily by Sheryl Sandberg, LeanIn.org and the Girl Scouts, the campaign features prominent bossy women and various sponsors urging people to pledge not to use the word. Featured advocates who appear in Ban Bossy promotional material in addition to Sandberg include Jennifer Garner, Jane Lynch, Diane von F√ºrstenberg, Condoleezza Rice, Jimmie Johnson, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Arne Duncan, Anna Maria Ch√°vez, Victoria Beckham, and Beyonc√©, who stated \\"leadership is more important to boys than girls.\\" The campaign website also features training material designed for schools, teachers, parents and children to further the project.  Criticism  The campaign has received criticism since its launch. Joan Rivers commented that she found the online movement to be \\"so stupid\\" and added, \\"I find it outrageous and I find it petty ... and I find we're so damn uptight in this country that this whole country is being divided.\\" Phil Mason has drawn parallels between the banning of words and authoritarianism, observing that telling people what words they can or cannot use is inherently bossy. In The New Yorker, Margaret Talbot criticized the campaign itself as bossy and instead suggested reclaiming the word, much as has been done for \\"nerd\\" and \\"queer\\". NewsBusters blogger Katie Yoder described Beyonc√©'s support of the campaign as hypocritical, in light of how the word \\"bitch\\" is spoken nine times on the singer's self-titled album.

Colectivo has become an umbrella term for armed paramilitary groups that operate in poverty-stricken areas and attack individuals, engaging in \\"extortion, kidnapping, drug trafficking and murder\\". They are associated with extrajudicial killings and terrorizing those who disagree with them. The term may also refer to a community organization with any shared purpose, such as a neighborhood group that organizes social events. Some colectivos began by doing community work or helping with social programs in barrios, and their members said they promoted democracy, political activism and culture. As of 2019, there are dozens of colectivos in Venezuela. In 2018, InSight Crime reported 46 groups in one barrio (slum), 23 de Enero, alone. They operate in 16 Venezuelan states, controlling about 10% of Venezuelan cities. Some personnel of Venezuela's intelligence agencies, including the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence and the Bolivarian Intelligence Service, are also members of colectivos. Colectivos have both legal and illegal funding sources. They were initially funded by the Bolivarian government; some receive funds to distribute government food packages and have access to government \\"slush funds\\". They are also funded by extortion, black-market food and the drug trade. Human Rights Watch described colectivos as \\"armed gangs who use violence with impunity\\" to harass political opponents of the Venezuelan government. Amnesty International calls them \\"armed pro-government supporters who are tolerated or supported by the authorities\\". They have attacked anti-government protesters and Venezuelan opposition television staff, sent death threats to journalists, and once tear- gassed the Vatican envoy. Through violence and intimidation, in 2019 they have increasingly become a means of quashing the opposition and maintaining political power; Maduro called on them during the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts saying, \\"The time has come for active resistance\\", and asking them \\"to defend the peace of every barrio, of every block\\". The National Assembly of Venezuela designated the colectivos as terrorist groups due to their \\"violence, paramilitary actions, intimidation, murders and other crimes,\\" declaring their acts as state-sponsored terrorism. Description and history Colectivos emerged during the 1960s from guerrilla warfare in urban Venezuela, and made a return during the presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez, when Ch√°vez created their parent organizations, known as Bolivarian Circles. InSight Crime says their power began to increase in 2002, when Ch√°vez decided he needed a security force independent of the military to counteract opposition demonstrators. In 2006, they received arms and funding from the state when they were brought under the government's community councils. Ch√°vez eliminated the Metropolitan Police in 2011, turning security over to the colectivos in some Caracas barrios. Bloomberg says that when he created the Bolivarian Circles, Ch√°vez \\"brought the former outlaws into the socialist fold\\", where some also gained access to weapons through government jobs. Stratfor says that Diosdado Cabello‚Äîpresident of the 2017 Constituent National Assembly but then serving as chief of staff for Ch√°vez‚Äîwas instrumental in the founding of the Bolivarian Circles, and maintains close ties to the colectivos. According to Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society, colectivos were modeled after the Iranian Basij militia; Humire noted that Ch√°vez had personal meetings with Iranian officials that included the commander of Basij, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Nadqi. Ch√°vez assigned colectivos to be \\"the armed wing of the Bolivarian Revolution\\" for the Venezuelan government, giving them weapons, communication systems, motorcycles and surveillance equipment to exercise control in the hills of Caracas where police are forbidden entry. Some weapons given to the groups include assault rifles, submachine guns and grenades. Colectivos were historically aligned with far-left politics in Venezuela, and act as \\"enforcers for the government\\", working with the Venezuelan armed forces and the ruling political party, PSUV. New York University Latin American Studies professor Alejandro Velasco said in 2019, \\"They have all the trappings of a paramilitary repressive force.\\" Velasco, who studies colectivos, describes a change in the allegiance of colectivos, saying it has become more about power than supporting chavismo or a leftist ideology. The Economist says they bring money into slums, punish criminals and intimidate political opponents. Some colectivos partake in drug trafficking, control access to the supply of food and medicine, and commit acts of extortion. In 2008, some colectivos helped with after-school programs, child care centers, puppet shows, drug rehabilitation, and sports programs; they also encouraged voting by going door to door and protect communities from criminals. Every member of a colectivo is required to bring ten individuals to vote at polls during elections. Over time, colectivos became more heavily armed and their criminal activity increased. A small number of groups maintain community and cultural functions; most are \\"criminal gangs with immense social control\\", who \\"work alongside the security forces, often doing their dirty work for them\\", according to InSight Crime. Members can be difficult to identify, because they often wear masks and do not have license plates on their motorcycles. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has described colectivos as \\"pro-Government armed groups\\" that \\"decide who receives government assistance and perform surveillance and intelligence activities for the authorities [and have] intimidated, threatened and attacked people perceived as opposed to the Government\\". In 2019, the National Assembly of Venezuela designated the colectivos as terrorist groups due to their \\"violence paramilitary actions, intimidation, murders and other crimes\\", declaring their acts as state-sponsored terrorism. Activity =2002‚Äì13= When Ch√°vez was briefly ousted in 2002, colectivos helped lead demonstrations supporting him, and worked with the military to help return him as president. At a 2007 Central University of Venezuela riot, armed men riding motorcycles arrived, scaring off students. In 2009, several dozen motorcyclists with red berets surrounded the entrance of the offices of television station Globovisi√≥n and subdued the security guards, entering the facility by force while tossing two tear gas canisters into the building. Ch√°vez condemned the attack and pro-government leader Lina R√≥n was jailed for three months following the incident. Colectivos tear-gassed the Vatican envoy in 2009 after Ch√°vez accused the Roman Catholic Church of interfering with his government. During the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election, Reuters said colectivos were \\"a key part of the government's electoral machinery\\" that \\"help[ed] sway close races and are sometimes tarred by critics as poll station thugs who intimidate opponents\\". The Carter Center said that during the elections, voting centers had an \\"intimidating climate\\" when motorcyclists \\"associated with the governing party\\" surrounded them. =2014‚Äì16= Colectivos fire toward the protest where Genesis Carmona was killed during a protest. The Venezuelan Prison Minister, Iris Varela, said that colectivos were a \\"fundamental pillar in the defense of the homeland\\". During the 2014 Venezuelan protests against new president Nicol√°s Maduro, colectivos acted with impunity against the opposition protesters. When armed groups threatened to rape individuals in an apartment complex in Maracaibo, the National Guard did not intervene. The Civil Association for Citizen Control said that more than half of those killed during the protests were killed by colectivos. During the 2014 protests, armed colectivos attacked and burned a large portion of Ferm√≠n Toro University after intimidating student protesters and shooting one. The colectivos broke into the facility, looted, and damaged 40% of the university. Armed groups reported to be colectivos attacked the University of Los Andes in the city of M√©rida in March 2015, supposedly to intimidate the protesters, shooting guns at students and faculty, holding the students hostage and stealing belongings of students. President Maduro thanked some groups of motorcyclists for their help against what he viewed as a \\"fascist coup d'etat... being waged by the extreme right\\"; at the same time, he distanced himself from armed groups by stating that they \\"had no place in the revolution\\". Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela's vice president at the time, also praised them saying, \\"If there has been exemplary behavior it has been the behavior of the motorcycle colectivos that are with the Bolivarian revolution.\\" In 2014, Arreaza promised that the government would disarm all irregular armed groups in Venezuela. The European Parliament asked the Venezuelan government to \\"immediately disarm and dissolve the uncontrolled armed pro-government groups and end their impunity\\". United States Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Venezuelan government of using \\"armed vigilantes\\" against those who opposed it. In a report titled \\"Punished for Protesting\\", Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated that government forces allowed colectivos \\"to attack protesters, journalists, students, or people they believed to be opponents of the government with security forces just meters away\\" and that \\"in some cases, the security forces openly collaborated with the pro-government attackers\\". HRW also stated that they \\"found compelling evidence of uniformed security forces and pro-government gangs attacking protesters side by side\\", and that the government tolerated this activity.  Robert Serra's murder  Rising PSUV member and colectivo mediator Robert Serra was stabbed more than 30 times, killing him, in his \\"heavily guarded home\\" on 1 October 2014. The Venezuelan government blamed the opposition for Serra's death; Foreign Policy said others considered his murder \\"inside job\\" because the government was \\"more factionalized since the death of Hugo Ch√°vez\\" with different \\"ideological strains and interests [clashing] beneath the party‚Äôs surface\\". A week after Serra's death, clashes between Venezuelan police and colectivos began when police raided the headquarters of the Shield of the Revolution group and according to Jos√© Odreman, \\"a close associate of Serra\\" and leader of the 5 de Marzo group, a colectivo member was \\"shot dead in his sleep\\" during the raid. Three officers were allegedly taken hostage. Right before he was shot, Odreman had made statements hinting at government involvement in Serra's death, saying to Minister Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres, ‚ÄúI lay full responsibility on you of what might happen to me. Enough comrades have been sacrificed‚Äù. Also available at San Diego Tribune. A little over an hour after his statements, photographs emerged showing the 5 de Marzo colectivo leader Odreman being held captive by Venezuelan authorities, followed by videos which showed his dead body lying in a pool of blood. The Venezuelan government denied any relationship to Serra's death and stated that the clashes between colectivos and authorities were due to a murder investigation. The director of CICPC, Jos√© Gregorio Sierralta, stated that officers were allegedly fired upon and responded with deadly force that killed the colectivo members including Odreman. Residents of the building denied Sierralta's statements, stating that there was no confrontation or hostages, that Venezuelan authorities first raided the building allegedly killing one member in his sleep then raided the building once more supposedly capturing and executing the other four colectivo members, altered nearby evidence and stole items from the scene. Maduro stated that the five men who were killed in the incident were allegedly a gang of former police officers led by Odreman. Runrunes noted in an investigative article that the police and bodyguards arrested by Venezuelan authorities involved with Serra's death were also members of colectivos. Following the clashes, Humberto L√≥pez (\\"El Ch√©\\"), a colectivo leader, stated that all colectivos were on \\"war footing\\" and that the colectivos \\"did not bet on death, we are committed to war. All colectivos are up in arms.\\" Noting that the Venezuelan Housing Mission buildings are in the hills of Caracas, El Ch√© assured that \\"the people would come down from the hills\\" if needed. Colectivos protested against the incidents and demanded the dismissal of then Ministry of Popular Power for Interior, Justice and Peace, Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres. Weeks later, on 24 October, Rodr√≠guez Torres was replaced by Carmen Mel√©ndez, with one of the reasons allegedly being the pressure colectivos placed on the government. Maduro also called on Freddy Bernal, a government leader with close ties to colectivos, to \\"reform\\" the police after the incident. Following the dismissal of Rodr√≠guez Torres, the 5 de Marzo colectivo also called for the dismissal of Diosdado Cabello. =2017‚Äì18= During the 2017 Venezuelan protests against Maduro, The New York Times stated that colectivos \\"appear to be playing a key role in repressing dissent\\"; they fight alongside officials and \\"engage in fiercer and often deadly intimidation\\". Bloomberg News said Maduro \\"unleashed the gangs on a large scale\\" during the protests. Days before the Mother of All Marches, Diosdado Cabello, a high-level PSUV official loyal to the Bolivarian government, stated that 60,000 motorized colectivos and the Bolivarian Militia would be spread throughout Caracas on 19 April to deter the opposition's march, calling the protest terrorism. During that march, Carlos Moreno, a 17-year-old boy, and 23-year-old Paola Ram√≠rez, were allegedly killed by members of colectivos. * * Colectivos also attacked Venezuela's opposition-majority National Assembly in 2017. Taking over the building where the legislature meets, they beat deputies and protesters with clubs and batons, splitting open the head of one deputy. Senator Marco Rubio discussing colectivos with Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo As the 2017 protests intensified, during the 11 May United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Worldwide Threats Hearing (SH-216), Senator Marco Rubio discussed with Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Mike Pompeo the role and actions of colectivos in Venezuela. Rubio asked if there was a \\"real threat\\" of colectivos selling advanced weaponry to the FARC, drug cartels or terrorists on the black market, to which Director Pompeo replied, \\"it is a real threat ... Maduro gets more desperate by the hour, the risk of these colectivos acting in a way that is not under his control increases as time goes on as well\\", mentioning that there has not been evidence of major arms deals taking place, though \\"stockpiles exist\\". Colectivos were involved in the 2018 operation to kill Venezuelan rebel √ìscar Alberto P√©rez, working alongside Venezuelan troops during the El Junquito raid. Heiker Leobaldo V√°squez Ferrera of a colectivo located in 23 de Enero was killed during the operation, with Bellingcat and Forensic Architecture highlighting that such cooperation between colectivos and Venezuelan authorities showed there was little separation between them. In early 2018, Voice of America said members of colectivos in Aragua state appeared on a Colombian radio show and explained that they were paid by the government to violently prevent opposition marches and that some of their colleagues had \\"murdered several people\\". =2019= InSight Crime says that colectivos provided strong support for Maduro when he assumed the presidency in his disputed second term. With National Assembly-designated acting President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid√≥, challenging Maduro's claim to the office, and amid an international effort to convince Maduro to step down and allow humanitarian aid into the country, Bloomberg News reported that colectivos \\"led the charge\\" against the opposition to Maduro. Because Guaid√≥ offered an amnesty law to officials and military officers who disavow Maduro, and the colectivos have \\"nothing to lose\\", the \\"government may be using colectivos to relieve pressure on the military\\" during the 2019 Venezuelan protests, according to Velasco. As tens of thousands of protesters marched in support on the day that Guaid√≥ took the oath to serve as president, The Guardian reported that Maduro \\"allies threatened the use of armed pro-government militias‚Äìknown as colectivos‚Äîto quell disturbances\\". Rafael Uzc√°tegui‚ÄîDirector of Venezuela's human rights organization, PROVEA‚Äîsaid there were 43 deaths at the protests as of 6 February; he believed most could be attributed to Venezuela's Special Action Force (FAES), followed by the colectivos. InSight Crime said that it is likely that Maduro \\"recruited (...) FAES members from the colectivos for their callousness and bloodthirstiness\\". The Washington Post said colectivos are increasingly made up of government or police personnel. Over the weekend of 23‚Äì24 February, as Guaid√≥ and the opposition sought to bring humanitarian aid across Venezuela's borders and into the country, colectivos attacked people at both the Colombian and Brazilian borders. Bloomberg said \\"within a block of an international bridge where food and medicine were waiting\\" for aid to enter, \\"colectivos terrorized thousands\\". They fired weapons from speeding motorcycles, and one protester stated that masked men stepped from behind a row of Venezuelan National Guard and fired on the crowd at the Venezuelan border, while a doctor said that colectivos terrorized with weapons medics who were volunteering to help the wounded. At the Brazilian border, Bloomberg reported that observers said \\"colectivos ran rampant\\"; four died and hundreds were wounded. Humberto Prado, the director of the Venezuelan Prison Observatory, \\"accused the Maduro government of releasing prison inmates to fill the colectivos' ranks in their repression efforts\\", according to InSight Crime. As many military personnel defected into Colombia during the border clashes, InSight Crime suggested that \\"many of those who fled (...) did so because they were forced to work with the colectivos\\". The South Florida Sun reported that \\"colectivos have escalated attacks (...) opening fire on civilians and terrorizing communities.\\" InSight Crime says that, as a result of the crisis in Venezuela, some colectivo members \\"are beginning to waver in their allegiance to the government because they have not been receiving the economic benefits they once did\\", but that \\"they fear persecution should they abandon the government‚Äôs revolution\\". But The Washington Post said that Maduro relies on them and they help him stay in power in spite of a crumbling economy; Ch√°vez was more popular and not as dependent on colectivos, while Maduro is unpopular because of the economic conditions in the country, and has resorted to violence and intimidation for power. Public Radio International stated that opposition demonstrations \\"are routinely broken up by masked motorcyclists who open fire onto crowds\\" and that the government relies on the \\"loyalty of these irregular paramilitary groups to deal with the public heavy-handedly rather than the military, which could potentially disobey uncomfortable orders and cause a government-military rupture\\".a During the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts in March, Maduro called on the armed paramilitary gangs, saying, \\"The time has come for active resistance\\". US State Department special envoy to Venezuela Elliot Abrams labeled this a \\"breakdown in law and order\\", and said, \\"That's calling for armed gangs to take over the streets (...) Perhaps it is a sign of Maduro's lack of confidence in his own security forces.\\" As blackouts continued, on 31 March, citizens protested the lack of electricity and water in Caracas and other cities; some of the protests occurred close to the presidential palace. Maduro called again on the colectivos, asking them \\"to defend the peace of every barrio, of every block\\". Videos circulated on social media showing colectivos threatening protesters and shooting in the streets; two protesters were shot. In 2019, the National Assembly of Venezuela designated the colectivos as terrorist groups due to their \\"violence paramilitary actions, intimidation, murders and other crimes\\", declaring their acts as state-sponsored terrorism. Prominent groups There were between 20 and 100 different colectivo groups in Venezuela as of 2014, with the most prominent groups being the Tupamaros, La Piedrita, Tres Raices, Frente Francisco de Miranda, Alexis Vive, and Ciudad Socialista Frente 5 de Marzo, In 2018, InSight Crime reported 46 groups in the 23 de Enero barrio alone. They control about 10% of Venezuelan cities, and operate in 16 Venezuelan states; Velasco says they number 5,000 to 7,000 individuals nationwide as of 2019. InSight Crime says that Tres Ra√≠ces and Frente 5 de Marzo are closely linked with Venezuela's security forces. Tres Raices is also \\"one of the better armed\\" with members also working government jobs for SEBIN (Intelligence), DGCIM (military counterintelligence), FAES (police special action force) or municipal police. =La Piedrita= Capital District. La Piedrita colectivo is one of the most influential in Caracas, specifically in 23 de Enero barrio where it has its roots dating to 1985 with founders Carlos Ram√≠rez and Valent√≠n Santana. La Piedrita formally organized when Bolivarian Circles were established by Ch√°vez in Venezuela, and since then, has been described as a colectivo that is one of \\"the most violent in the country\\". La Piedrita was also headed by Lina Ron, who at the time of her leadership stated that thousands of Bolivarian Circles such as her own were \\"armed to the teeth\\". Ron allegedly had a connection with Diosdado Cabello from as early as 2002 when Cabello was allegedly the key supporter of Ron. Also, Cabello had supposedly mediated between La Piedrita and the Tupamaros when they had a conflict in 2010. =Tupamaros= The Revolutionary Tupamaro Movement (Tupamaro) is a far left Marxist colectivo and political organization in Venezuela. Several Tupamaros participate in peaceful movements while some believe the \\"idea of armed struggle as a means to gain power\\". Ch√°vez's government had an \\"ambiguous\\" relationship with the Tupamaros, who helped manage social programs, such as child care and drug rehabilitation centers, and promoted political participation; however, the Tupamaros' involvement in vigilante justice in high crime areas that the police force often avoided led to rifts with the federal government, which resorted on occasions to using the military to deal with the groups when they clashed with police. The Tupamaros are known to \\"cleanse\\" neighborhoods of criminals: if repeated warnings to criminals to leave an area fail, they often resort to murder using \\"death squads\\", though some claim that these measures are taken to remove competition in the area. It was alleged that during the 2014 Venezuelan protests, Tupamaros worked with the Venezuelan National Guard to attack protesters, with videos and pictures uploaded to social networks purporting this to be true. Funding and resources =Monetary= Colectivos were initially funded by the Bolivarian government, but became less dependent on the government, by funding themselves through crimes such as drug trafficking and extortion. Gunson states that some funding for colectivos comes from demanding payment for protection and requiring members to pay fees. According to The New York Times, colectivos \\"control vast territory across Venezuela, financed in some cases by extortion, black-market food and parts of the drug trade as the government turns a blind eye in exchange for loyalty\\". The Washington Post says some colectivos \\"have been put in charge of the distribution of government food packages in poor areas‚Äîgiving them control over hungry neighborhoods. In 2018, InSight Crime reported that the colectivos have diverse income sources‚Äîboth legal and illegal. Some run legal, profitable businesses, but also receive government funds, largely through the profitable venture of distributing food through government concessions. One Tupamaro leader told InSight Crime that trafficking food and medicine is as profitable as drug-running, while less risky. InSight Crime also learned that colectivos are running \\"clandestine casinos\\". Also available in Spanish. Some colectivos, such as the Tupamaros, have formal links with the Venezuelan government and politics, with over 7,000 individuals on the Caracas payroll since 2008. Stratfor says that Diosdado Cabello, Freddy Bernal and Eliezer Otaiza, have been implicated in directing colectivos or helping fund them. Colectivos also receive funds from government funding for community projects. Velasco states that colectivos \\"receive government funding through both formal and informal channels, including slush funds the government doles out to different sectors\\" and also have \\"personal ties between members and government officials to access resources\\". =Weapons= El Pais stated that the Venezuelan government directly arms colectivos with weapons. Velasco believes that the same formal and informal methods of receiving funds is used for weapons. These methods include being armed and trained in formal government militias or working as security and bodyguards. Despite the Venezuelan government's statements saying that only official authorities can carry weapons for the defense of Venezuela, colectivos are armed with automatic rifles such as AK-47s, submachine guns, fragmentation grenades, and tear gas. Social effects In a March 2014 interview, Reinaldo Iturriza, the Minister of Communes in Venezuela, condemned what he perceived as a campaign to demonize the 'colectivos' by attributing recent violence to them and defining them as armed paramilitary groups. He insisted that \\"the collectives are not synonymous with guns and violence, but with popular participation, organization, and mobilization, [...] with working together with the Bolivarian government to solve specific problems in the communities.\\" =Crime= Colectivos sometimes provide protection from crime in some neighborhoods they are committed to, though some neighborhoods report that colectivos attack neighbors themselves. As colectivos attempted to gain independence from the government, they began \\"controlling organized crime like drug trafficking in Caracas barrios. Some colectivos patrol the 23 de Enero barrio on motorcycles, masked and armed, supposedly to protect the neighborhood from criminals such as drug dealers. According to ABC News, \\"it is widely believed that colectivos kill drug traffickers who do not obey their orders\\". According to the International Crisis Group, colectivos may be involved in drug trafficking, arms dealing, and car theft. Phil Gunson, a freelance reporter for foreign media, states that, \\"It's no secret that many colectivos engage in criminal activities.\\" Gunson reported that colectivos combat criminal gangs in neighborhoods and take over the previous gang's business in crime and also take over buildings already owned by individuals and collect rent from the owners. Colectivos are thought to be partially responsible for the increase in the Venezuelan murder rate, according to the Metropolitan Observatory on Citizen Security. An Organization of American States report on human rights violations in Venezuela stated that colectivos murdered at least 131 individuals between 2014 and 2017 during anti-government protests. =Education= Children of the La Piedrita colectivo receiving awards at the Palacio Municipal de Caracas. As of 2013, colectivos ran education initiatives. According to Ennio Cardozo, a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela, colectivos \\"do talks, forums and they indoctrinate very young kids into Marxism. The government finances all this. But if you don't agree with them they will shut you out from most of the social programs until you give allegiance to the (socialist) party.\\" The president of the School of Teachers in Tachira, Javier Tarazona, stated that the Venezuelan government encouraged the participation of guerrillas and colectivos in schools and that their involvement allegedly \\"promotes violence, confrontation and, if necessary, war\\". The president of the Venezuelan Chamber of Private Education, Mar√≠a Teresa Hern√°ndez, declared in 2014 that Resolution 058 passed in 2012 by the government was unconstitutional and that it \\"seeks for colectivos with political projects of the ruling party to be directly involved in public and private schools\\". She stated that schoolchildren are \\"very easy to manipulate\\" and need to develop political beliefs on their own. Article 102, for example, states that \\"Education, is a public service, and is grounded on the respect for all currents of thought\\".

It stars Yvonne DeLaRosa and Sherman Koltz as residents in a purgatory-like existence where people are reincarnated as animals.  Plot  Opening narration from Gene, a middle-aged American, explains that he has died, entered purgatory, and has been having strange dreams and compulsions. In this afterlife, people slowly take on the characteristics of animals, and Gene's nature is that of a spider. As he drifts aimlessly through Baja, Mexico, where he died while on vacation, he meets a Mexican woman named Ana who can speak no English. Ana, who is taking on the characteristics of a caterpillar, died on the way to meet her boyfriend when her abusive ex-husband attempted to kidnap her. Because he speaks no Spanish, Gene can only understand that she needs help. Grateful to find a purpose, Gene decides to help Ana, unaware of the danger posed by her violent ex-husband, who also died in the botched kidnapping attempt. Along the way, Gene and Ana witness much in the way of strange behavior, and they begin to give in to their own bestial compulsions: Ana begins eating leaves, while Gene becomes obsessed with wrapping everything in web-like rope. Although ashamed at the cannibalistic ramifications, Gene ultimately begins eating corpses he has wrapped in rope. In the end, Gene preys upon and consumes Ana's ex-husband.  Cast  * Yvonne DeLaRosa as Ana * Sherman Koltz as Gene  Production  Director Ryan Harper was inspired to set the film in Baja after taking a road trip there himself. Harper, a scientist, describes himself as not spiritual, but he wanted to explore concepts of death, reincarnation, and animal instinct. Harper recruited the cast and crew through Craigslist and other local websites.  Release  Circulation premiered at the Another Hole in the Head Film Festival in San Francisco, California. It was theatrically released in November 2008. It was released on DVD on December 9, 2008.  Reception  The film received mixed reviews. Mike Everleth of the Underground Film Journal says that a lot of the appeal of the film is how nicely Harper lets the film reveal itself. Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times called it inept and muddled. LA Weekly wrote that its originality saves it from becoming dull due to the slow pacing. Cheryl Eddy of the San Francisco Bay Guardian called it slow-paced but enjoyable. Jeremy Blitz of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it a \\"moody, hard to classify film that is often confusing, most of the time intentionally.\\" David Johnson of DVD Verdict called it a bizarre, original film that comes close to being too pretentious. Travis Keune of We Are Movie Geeks says that Harper shows that even with a limited budget, he can still stretch that dollar by utilizing creativity, ingenuity and a clear understanding of what it takes to make an interesting movie. Scott Larson wrote that there is a bit of magic realism going on here, and the unsettling sense of dreaming and the strange noises on the soundtrack remind us a bit of David Lynch. The David Lynch comparison was also made by Film Apocalypse who writes, \\"From a viewer's perspective, the story seems much more natural in the beginning and only slowly moves into a strange and eerie, David Lynch style as the movie progresses.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2008 films Category:2000s fantasy thriller films Category:2008 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American fantasy thriller films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films about the afterlife Category:Films set in Mexico Category:Films shot in Mexico Category:Purgatory in fiction Category:2008 independent films ","title":"Circulation (film)"},{"id":"42254815","text":"Anderson Tanoto is a member of the Board of Trustees at Tanoto Foundation, a philanthropic organization involved in poverty alleviation through education, \\"empowerment\\" and \\"the enhancement of the quality of lives\\".

Unveiled in 1989, it was sculpted by Wincenty Kuƒáma and the architect was Jacek Budyn. It is located on the southern side of Krasi≈Ñski Square. The monument has been described as \\"the most important monument of post-war Warsaw.\\" Gazeta Wyborcza reported in 2012 that it is one of the most visited landmarks for foreign tourists. History Smaller section of the monument The Warsaw Uprising, which broke out on 1 August 1944 and lasted until 2 October 1944, was one of the most important and devastating events in the history of Warsaw and Poland. Up to 90% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed during the hostilities and the systematic destruction of the city carried out by the Germans after the uprising. However, it was also an event that the communist authorities of the post-war People's Republic of Poland found highly controversial, as it was organised by the Polish resistance movement that had fought for Poland's independence during World War II, principally the Home Army, the remnants of which were brutally suppressed by the postwar Stalinist regime. In addition, Joseph Stalin had purposefully stopped the Soviet advance through Polish territory just short of Warsaw immediately after the outbreak of the uprising, and he not only refused to aid the insurgents but also refused to allow planes of the western allies to land and refuel on Soviet-held territory to ensure that only very limited supplies could be delivered to Warsaw. As a result, the uprising was brutally crushed by the Germans over a period of 63 days while the Soviets watched on (even after they had finally resumed their offensive and capturing the right bank the River Vistula in mid-September 1944). After the uprising, the Germans expelled the entire population from the city and spent the whole of October, November and December 1944 in looting Warsaw and destroying whatever was still standing while the Soviets continued to do nothing to intervene (they entered the ruins of the abandoned city only in January 1945 after they had waited for the Germans to leave). Main section of the monument As a result, the significance of the uprising was downplayed for many years after the war, and the Home Army and the wartime Polish government-in-exile were condemned by communist propaganda. Such political factors made official memorialisation of the Warsaw Uprising impossible for decades, and subsequent debates about the form and location of the monument further delayed the project. Poland's communist government finally gave permission to construct the monument on 12 April 1988. It was unveiled on 1 August 1989, the 45th anniversary of the Uprising. The monument was designed by sculptor Wincenty Kuƒáma and architect Jacek Budyn. The monument was visited by German president Roman Herzog on 1994, who paid tribute to the Poles and gave a speech about German shame in context of Nazi Germany's crimes during the Second World War in Poland. Herzog apologized to the Poles during his speech about war crimes.http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Roman- Herzog/Reden/1994/08/19940801_Rede.html Description Presidents Donald Trump and Andrzej Duda at the Warsaw Uprising Monument, 2017 The monument is on the southern side of Krasi≈Ñski Square. In 1999, the building of the Supreme Court of Poland was constructed in the area directly behind it. The monument is made of bronze and is about tall. It has of two parts near each other. The larger, elevated element shows a group of insurgents actively engaged in combat, running from the artistic vision of a collapsing building, represented by a more abstract composition. The smaller element shows insurgents descending into a manhole, a reference to the use of Warsaw's sewer system by the insurgents to move across German-held territory during the uprising and specifically to the evacuation of 5300 resistance fighters from Warsaw's Old Town to the city centre at the beginning of September 1944, a five-hour journey which started from Krasi≈Ñski Square (there is a small plaque across the road from the monument at the intersection of D≈Çuga and Miodowa Streets above the two manholes that were actually used). The realistic style of the monument has been favourably compared to a still from a movie or a historical painting by Jan Matejko, but has been also criticised for its socrealist style. There have also been critical voices saying that the monument is \\"defeatist\\" and that it was a gesture of reconciliation by the passing communist government that came many years too late. A 2013 analysis suggests that the monument is in need of renovation, particularly for its deterioration caused by atmospheric pollutants. According to the authors, it is a part of a memorial triptych, the other two parts of which are the Monument to the Defenders of the Polish Post Office (pl) in Gda≈Ñsk and the Monument to the Fallen in Defense of the Homeland (pl) in Czƒôstochowa.

Early life Thomas Bridson Cribb was born on 1 December 1845 in London, England, the son of Benjamin Cribb and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Bridson). He immigrated with his parents on the Chaseley arriving in Moreton Bay in May 1849. He was educated privately and was one of the foundation scholars at Ipswich Boys' Grammar School. He was a partner in the family retail business, Cribb & Foote Thomas Bridson Cribb and Marion Lucy n√©e Foote on their wedding day, 3 June 1874. The bride appears to be in mourning clothes, probably for the death of Benjamin Cribb (Thomas's father) who died in March 1874. On 3 June 1874, he married Marian Lucy Foote, daughter of John Clarke Foote (his father's business partner in Cribb & Foote). The Cribb and Foote families were active in Queensland politics, with Thomas's father Benjamin Cribb, his uncle Robert Cribb, his brother James Clarke Cribb, his wife's father John Clarke Foote and his wife's uncle James Foote all member of the Queensland Parliament. Politics Cribb was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on 23 May 1893. Although a lifetime appointment, he resigned on 13 March 1896 to stand for election for the Legislative Assembly in the 1896 election. As a Ministerialist, Cribb represented the electoral district of Ipswich in the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 21 March 1896, holding the seat through the 1899 and 1902 elections. From 1 February 1902 to 17 September 1903, he served as the Treasurer of Queensland. As Treasurer, he introduced income tax in Queensland in December 1902 with the Income Tax Act 1902. The tax was very unpopular, leading to Cribb being defeated in the 1904 election on 27 August by Labor candidate William Ryott Maughan. Cribb contested Ipswich again in the 1907 election but was unsuccessful. Cribb was re-appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on 14 June 1913, but he was already suffering ill-health and died 3 months later on 4 September 1913.

Fullscreen Inc. et al. (13-cv-05472) was a case against multi-channel network Fullscreen (company), filed by the National Music Publishers Association on behalf of Warner/Chappell Music and 15 other music publishers, which alleged that Fullscreen illegally reaped the profits of unlicensed cover videos on YouTube without paying any royalties to the rightful publishers and songwriters. According to the lawsuit, the defendant Fullscreen was accused of having \\"willfully ignored their obligation to obtain licenses and pay royalties to exploit the vast majority of the musical content disseminated over Fullscreen's networks.\\" Among the musical content that Fullscreen allegedly infringed upon were songs by Justin Bieber, Ke$ha, Kanye West, and Katy Perry.  Facts  The National Music Publishers Association filed this copyright infringement lawsuit in the Southern District of New York on August 6, 2013, accusing Fullscreen of 4 distinct copyright violations: 1) direct copyright infringement, 2) contributory copyright infringement, 3) inducement of copyright infringement, and 4) vicarious copyright infringement. By way of explanation, the plaintiff suggested that Fullscreen 1) copied directly from another's work without a license (direct infringement), 2) contributed to and supported its partners' infringement (contributory copyright infringement), 3) is liable for the actions of its partners' infringement and directly profited financially from the act (vicarious infringement), and 4) aided/induced the act of infringement knowingly. Prior to this, the NMPA filed a similar lawsuit against another multi-channel network, Maker Studios, which then very promptly agreed to settle out of court and to establish a compensation model for both past infringements and future licenses that fully comply with the Copyright Act. = NMPA = The National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) is the largest trade association that represents American music publishers and songwriters, including Warner/Chappell Music and Palm Valley Music. It was founded in 1917, and currently hosts more than 300 members. Its primary mission is to protect the rights of publishers and songwriters, in both domestic and international matters. It aims to maintain a music business environment that fosters financial and creative success of artists, with its particular focus on affiliated publishers and songwriters. = Fullscreen = Fullscreen is one of the largest YouTube multi-channel networks that generates over 3 billion monthly video views across all of their channels. This multimillion-dollar company was founded in January 2011 by CEO George Strompolos, and houses some of YouTube's most successful talent, including Lindsey Stirling, The Fine Brothers, Tyler Ward, and Megan Nicole. According to the company, Fullscreen is affiliated with over 15,000 YouTube channels that have garnered a total of 200 million subscribers and over 2.5 billion views per month. Fullscreen acquires more than 30 million unique visitors each month, across all of their channels. Like many other multichannel networks, Fullscreen primarily consists of channels with covered musical content. The network profits directly from the advertising revenue generated by these unlicensed music videos.  Result  A settlement was reached that required Fullscreen creators to license their music videos or remove them completely. The channel managed by Fullscreen was to remove all offending videos entirely, whereas Fullscreen partners were given the opportunity to license these videos. George Strompolos, Fullscreen CEO, commented: :: \\"Fullscreen is pleased to be one of the leading multi- channel networks to establish landmark licenses with major music publishers on behalf of Fullscreen's music artists. We commend the NMPA for their proactiveness and helping to clear the way for us to establish new relationships with music publishers. Fullscreen will continue to pioneer 'win/win/win' solutions for emerging musicians, their audiences, and existing rights holders within the music industry.\\" David Israelite, NMPA president and CEO noted: :: \\"This settlement demonstrates the fundamental value of songwriters and their music publishing partners, and highlights NMPA's mission to fight for fair compensation and protection of songwriters' rights.\\" Fullscreen, along with other multi-channel networks, are now aiming to create deals with music publishers, in order for its partners to be able to continue producing cover videos. Fullscreen and Maker Studios have announced a deal already with Universal Music Publishing Group, which allows the networks access and monetization of Universal's entire music library. The revenue from these videos will then be split among the YouTube artist, Fullscreen, and Universal Music Publishing Group.  Background  = Multi-channel Networks = Multi-channel networks (MCN) are companies that work with YouTube channels and assist with funding, rights' management, audience development, and monetization. They are neither affiliated with nor endorsed by Google, and receive a portion of the advertising revenue that they help generate for their affiliated YouTube channels. Recently, it has become more profitable to work with brands on integrated marketing, using clever ways to incorporate advertising within a YouTube creator's video. Though MCNs can offer YouTube creators with connections to brands and sponsorship deals, as well as financial support, there has been criticism against them. YouTube personality Ray William Johnson left his MCN Maker Studios, when he was asked to renegotiate his contract and give up 40% of his advertising revenue and 50% of the intellectual property of his show, \\"Equals Three.\\" = Content ID = Content ID is a system built by YouTube (Google) in 2007 that scans every video uploaded to YouTube for copyright infringement. Copyright holders register their content into the system, and when Content ID identifies usage of that content in a user-generated video, it notifies the rights-owner and allows them the choice to 1) monetize the video, 2) block the video completely, or 3) track the video and gain all analytics insights. YouTube producers may dispute or appeal Content ID claims. Content ID has made it easier for content owners to track down usage of their content and regain control over its availability and monetization on YouTube. Uploaders receive a strike for each case of infringement, and have their accounts suspended upon their third strike. YouTubers and certain publishers have settled on blanket synchronization licenses, that allow publishers to take up to 50% of the revenues generated by videos that use their content. YouTube has direct licensing contracts with many music publishers, which pay them the due royalties for cover songs uploaded by YouTubers. Multi-channel networks like Fullscreen, however, are not covered under these contracts. = Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc. = Copyright infringement cases regarding unlicensed videos on YouTube began long before this case between the NMPA and Fullscreen. In 2007, Viacom sued Google over alleged copyright violations within its YouTube service. In March 2014, the two companies announced its settlement, stating that \\"Google and Viacom today jointly announced the resolution of the Viacom vs. YouTube copyright litigation. This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities and we look forward to working more closely together.\\" When the lawsuit was first initiated, Viacom was asking $1 billion in damages from Google, alleging that YouTube had engaged in \\"brazen\\" and \\"massive\\" copyright infringement, by allowing its users to upload thousands of videos owned by Viacom, without licenses. In 2010, Google's motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal was granted, based on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Though Viacom appealed, District Judge Stanton granted summary judgment again, in favor of defendant Google in April 2013.  Related Issues  * Copyright infringement * Viacom International Inc. v.

History The museum originated from the Honduran Air Force (FAH), which had stored and preserved aircraft and exhibits from the 1930s, some of which remained airworthy into the 1980s, such as a North American NA-42, Vought F4U Corsair and a North American AT-6. In 1986 representatives of the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, gave the Honduran public chats and conferences and realized that the Honduran Institute of Culture Interamericana-IHCI had the potential for creating a museum of national aviation, It is so the initiative gives his first steps inside the command and active personnel of her FAH which interfere to such a degree of founding and organizing the \\"Museum of the Air of Honduras\\" the second step was the disposition to donate 12 aircraft in the Officials' Club of the FAH at the end of the 80s what determines the second stage in road surface for the organization of so important project.

G. Wells, first published in 1894 in the Pall Mall Budget., accessed 16 March 2014. It was included in The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents, the first collection of short stories by Wells, published in 1895. In the story, a businessman hears an account from a man who has devoted years attempting to make artificial diamonds, only to end as a desperate outcast. Historical background It was known since experiments of Antoine Lavoisier that diamond was a form of carbon. Wells's story appeared a few years after the claims of James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879 and Ferdinand Fr√©d√©ric Henri Moissan in 1893, that they had made artificial diamonds. Moissan heated charcoal (a form of carbon) and iron in a furnace until the iron melted; then rapidly cooled, the iron would generate high pressure and transform the charcoal into diamonds. Others tried to repeat this experiment in later years, and very small diamonds were created; commercially successful production of synthetic diamonds was not achieved until the 1950s.Artificial Diamonds Human Touch of Chemistry, accessed 16 March 2014.History of Man Made Diamonds Man Made Diamond Information, accessed 16 March 2014. Story The narrator is getting relief from his business life by gazing at the river from the Thames Embankment near Temple (Essex Street is mentioned, and there is a view of Waterloo Bridge and the towers of Westminster beyond). Here, someone who looks like a tramp starts a conversation with him. Despite his appearance he talks like an educated businessman. He has a bag of what appear to be uncut diamonds. One, which is as big as the tip of a thumb, he offers to sell for a hundred pounds, but the narrator is suspicious. The man tells him that he has spent years on a project to make diamonds. It was done secretly, so that others would not copy his work, and so that he could sell his diamonds without it being known that they could be produced in large quantities. After his money ran out he conducted his experiments in cheap lodgings in Kentish Town, and had various menial jobs. He finally succeeded when, using an idea suggested by experiments of Gabriel Auguste Daubr√©e, he put the mixture which might produce diamonds together with dynamite in a cylinder too strong to burst. However, as he inspected the results a neighbour in the lodgings house, thinking he was a bomb-making anarchist, told him he had called the police. He abandoned the lodgings house, taking with him his diamonds; this left him in the state in which the narrator has found him: homeless and carrying diamonds which he cannot try to sell without causing suspicion. The narrator thinks the man's story might be genuine, and gives him his business card, but although he has some communication with him for a period, he does not see the man again. Reflecting later on the encounter, he wonders if the man is dead, or will perhaps re-emerge and become famous; he wonders if he missed a business opportunity.

It is a rustic variety, native from the Pened√®s region in Catalonia (EU), drought resistant and with uniform development. The grape is long and big. It is used to produce red, white, ros√© wines and cava (Catalan form of Champagne, the so-called Traditional Method). Its former presence is also evident in the number of different names in Catalan dialects: sumoi, chimoi, saumoll, somoi, sumoy, ximoll, somoll, ximoy, xemoll, among others. The name is related to the local slang term sumollar, which means maturing or withering, from the Latin verb submolliare. Young wine from Sumoll grape has a slight roughness that disappears with aging. Its production is low and treatment for achieving quality wines requires high skills in wine production. Before and after phylloxera, the Sumoll was a variety of black grape widely grown throughout Catalonia.Josep M.

Wine growers are starting to recover and appreciate this variety, as they see an opportunity to create original wines that differentiate themselves by creating their own specialties, gaining a distance from the big industrial companies using only the stocks of international ubiquitous fashionable types - Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Chardonnay.Malena Fabregat, ¬´Sumoll, aut√≤ctona i clandestina¬ª, Gourmet's, El Peri√≥dico.com s.d. The Sumoll is one of the varieties referred by the following DOs (regional certificate of origin authorities), Catalunya, Pla de Bages, Tarragona. In Australia four crossings have been created from Cabernet Sauvignon and Sumoll: Cienna, Vermillion, Rubienne, and Tyrian. The purpose of this crossing is to adapt Sumoll qualities to suit the Australian climate. Using the synonym Vijariego Negro, to which it has been shown to be genetically identical, it is an authorised variety in a number of the Canary Islands DOPs, and the Spanish mainland Pla de Bages DOP.

These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar coprocessors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks. Heterogeneity Usually heterogeneity in the context of computing referred to different instruction-set architectures (ISA), where the main processor has one and other processors have another - usually a very different - architecture (maybe more than one), not just a different microarchitecture (floating point number processing is a special case of this - not usually referred to as heterogeneous). For example, ARM big.LITTLE is an exception where the ISAs of cores are the same and heterogeneity refers to the speed of different microarchitectures of the same ISA,A Survey Of Techniques for Architecting and Managing Asymmetric Multicore Processors, ACM Computing Surveys, 2015. thus making it more like a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP). In the past heterogeneous computing meant different ISAs had to be handled differently, while in a modern example, Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) systems eliminate the difference (for the user) while using multiple processor types (typically CPUs and GPUsS. Mittal and J. Vetter (2015), A Survey of CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Computing Techniques, ACM Computing Surveys.), usually on the same integrated circuit, to provide the best of both worlds: general GPU processing (apart from the GPU's well-known 3D graphics rendering capabilities, it can also perform mathematically intensive computations on very large data-sets), while CPUs can run the operating system and perform traditional serial tasks. The level of heterogeneity in modern computing systems is gradually increasing as further scaling of fabrication technologies allows for formerly discrete components to become integrated parts of a system-on-chip, or SoC. For example, many new processors now include built-in logic for interfacing with other devices (SATA, PCI, Ethernet, USB, RFID, radios, UARTs, and memory controllers), as well as programmable functional units and hardware accelerators (GPUs, cryptography co-processors, programmable network processors, A/V encoders/decoders, etc.). Recent findings show that a heterogeneous-ISA chip multiprocessor that exploits diversity offered by multiple ISAs can outperform the best same-ISA homogeneous architecture by as much as 21% with 23% energy savings and a reduction of 32% in Energy Delay Product (EDP). AMD's 2014 announcement on its pin-compatible ARM and x86 SoCs, codename Project Skybridge, suggested a heterogeneous-ISA (ARM+x86) chip multiprocessor in the making.  Challenges  Heterogeneous computing systems present new challenges not found in typical homogeneous systems. The presence of multiple processing elements raises all of the issues involved with homogeneous parallel processing systems, while the level of heterogeneity in the system can introduce non-uniformity in system development, programming practices, and overall system capability. Areas of heterogeneity can include: * ISA or instruction-set architecture ** Compute elements may have different instruction set architectures, leading to binary incompatibility. * ABI or application binary interface ** Compute elements may interpret memory in different ways. This may include both endianness, calling convention, and memory layout, and depends on both the architecture and compiler being used. * API or application programming interface ** Library and OS services may not be uniformly available to all compute elements. * Low- Level Implementation of Language Features ** Language features such as functions and threads are often implemented using function pointers, a mechanism which requires additional translation or abstraction when used in heterogeneous environments. * Memory Interface and Hierarchy ** Compute elements may have different cache structures, cache coherency protocols, and memory access may be uniform or non-uniform memory access (NUMA). Differences can also be found in the ability to read arbitrary data lengths as some processors/units can only perform byte-, word-, or burst accesses. * Interconnect ** Compute elements may have differing types of interconnect aside from basic memory/bus interfaces. This may include dedicated network interfaces, Direct memory access (DMA) devices, mailboxes, FIFOs, and scratchpad memories, etc. Furthermore, certain portions of a heterogeneous system may be cache-coherent, whereas others may require explicit software- involvement for maintaining consistency and coherency. * Performance ** A heterogeneous system may have CPUs that are identical in terms of architecture, but have underlying micro-architectural differences that lead to various levels of performance and power consumption. Asymmetries in capabilities paired with opaque programming models and operating system abstractions can sometimes lead to performance predictability problems, especially with mixed workloads. *Data Partitioning **While partitioning data on homogeneous platforms is often trivial, it has been shown that for the general heterogeneous case, the problem is NP-Complete . For small numbers of partitions, optimal partitionings that perfectly balance load and minimize communication volume have been shown to exist.  Example hardware  Heterogeneous computing hardware can be found in every domain of computing‚Äîfrom high-end servers and high-performance computing machines all the way down to low-power embedded devices including mobile phones and tablets. * High Performance Computing ** Cray XD1 ** SRC Computers SRC-6 and SRC-7 * Embedded Systems (DSP and Mobile Platforms) **Texas Instruments OMAP ** Analog Devices Blackfin **Qualcomm Snapdragon **Nvidia Tegra **Samsung Exynos **Apple \\"A\\" series **Movidius Myriad Vision processing units, which includes several symmetric processors, complemented by fixed function units, and a pair of SPARC based controllers. **HiSilicon Kirin SoCs **MediaTek SoCs **Cadence Design Systems Tensilica DSPs * Reconfigurable Computing ** Xilinx Field-programmable gate array (FPGA; e.g., Virtex-II Pro, Virtex 4 FX, Virtex 5 FXT) and Zynq and Versal Platforms ** Intel \\"Stellarton\\" (Atom + Altera FPGA) * Networking ** Intel IXP Network Processors ** Netronome NFP Network Processors * General Purpose Computing, Gaming, and Entertainment Devices **Intel Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell CPUs ** AMD Excavator and Ryzen APUs ** IBM Cell, found in the PlayStation 3 *** SpursEngine, a variant of the IBM Cell processor ** Emotion Engine, found in the PlayStation 2 **ARM big.LITTLE/DynamIQ CPU architecture *** Nearly all ARM vendors offer heterogeneous solutions; ARM, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Apple, Samsung, HiSilicon, MediaTek, etc. See also * GPGPU * MPSoC * big.LITTLE/DynamIQ References ","title":"Heterogeneous computing"},{"id":"42255367","text":"Merritt F.

The GIPR line was extended to Kalyan in 1854 and then on the south-east side to Khopoli via Palasdari railway station at the foot of the Western Ghats in 1856. While construction work was in progress across the Bhor Ghat, GIPR opened to public the Khandala-Pune track in 1858. The Bhor Ghat incline connecting Palasdari to Khandala was completed in 1862, thereby connecting Mumbai and Pune. GIPR extended its line to Raichur in 1871 and met the line of Madras Railway thereby establishing direct Mumbai-Chennai link. The first train service in southern India and the third in India was operated by Madras Railway from Royapuram / Veyasarapady to Wallajah Road (Arcot) in 1856. Madras Railway extended its trunk route to Beypur / Kadalundi (near Calicut) and initiated work on a north-western branch out of Arakkonam in 1861. The branch line reached Renigunta in 1862. The branch line out of Arakkonam reached Raichur in 1871, where it connected to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway line from Mumbai. Electrification The Kalyan-Pune section was electrified with 1.5 kV DC overhead system in 1930 and was converted to AC overhead system in 2010.

James Rhys Kilsby Jones, portrait by Ap Caledfryn Life Born on 4 February 1813 at Penylan, near Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, he was the son of Rhys Jones, a small farmer and local preacher, and later independent minister at Ffald-y-brenin in the same county. He received his early education at Neuaddlwyd grammar school, at Rhydybont, Blackburn Academy, and at the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen.Welsh Biography Online, Jones, James Rhys (Kilsby) Jones commenced his first pastorate at Leominster in 1834, during which time he met his future wife. Jones settled as minister of the independent church at Kilsby in Northamptonshire in January 1840, and was fully ordained there on 18 June of the same year. At this period he assumed the additional name \\"Kilsby\\". About 1850 he moved to Birmingham, and subsequently to Bolton. During his time in Bolton, he bought Gellifelen farm, near Llanwrtyd, Brecknockshire, his mother's birthplace, where he built a house called Glenview. initially, Glenview became a school for girls, run by a governess. In 1857, he received a call to Rhayader, some fifteen miles from Llanwrtyd, where he came to live at Glenview. The railway did not reach Llanwrtyd until 1868 so Kilsby was obliged to walk back and forth in all weathers. After three years at Rhayader, he received a call to be pastor of the Tonbridge congregational chapel in London. However, his pastorate there was not a success, due to Kilsby's often unconventional behaviour and also some theological differences. He returned to Llanwrtyd, and passed the rest of his life at Glenview. Jones resumed his pastorate at Rhayader but in 1868 he resigned to take up the pastorate of Caebach Chapel at Llandrindod Wells. (1868‚Äì1889). Almost immediately after commencing his pastorate, he instigated the building of Christ Church Chapel, at a cost of ¬£1700. He remained at Llandrindod for the rest of his life but did no ordinary pastoral work. In addition the church was unconventional in that there were no deacons, no church meeting and no Sunday School. Llandrindod was a popular spa town in the late Victorian era and Kilsby's chapel was a popular destination among nonconformist visitors. Public lecturer Kilsby established himself as one of the most popular exponents of the public lecture in the Welsh language. He usually lectured on religious figures such as Rhys Pritchard, Vicar of Llandovery and Daniel Rowland, the Methodist pioneer. These lectures were often associated with raising funds for chapel building. For example, Kilsby lectured on Rowland at Cwmavon in December 1869, with the funds going towards the building of a new chapel at Rock, Cwmavon, The \\"chief inhabitants\\" of the valley were reported to be present at the event. Political activity Like many nineteenth century Welsh nonconformist ministers, Jones became involved politically with the Liberal Party. In 1863 he met Sir Thomas Lloyd at a Congregationalist meeting at Hawen Chapel, Rhydlewis, at a time when Lloyd was regarded as the future candidate for the Cardiganshire county seat. However, he was disappointed that Lloyd declined to oppose the sitting member, Colonel Powell of Nanteos, who in 1865 briefly reversed a decision to retire due to ill-health before withdrawing again a short time later. At the 1865 General Election, Kilsby was a prominent supporter of David Davies in his unsuccessful campaign in Cardiganshire, and he had close links with Aberystwyth radicals such as John Matthews and John Jones (Ivon). His polemical account of the Cardiganshire election in the Traethodydd was long regarded as a definitive account. In 1865 Kilsby Jones also actively campaigned for David Williams in Merioneth. As well as his involvement in electoral contests, Kilsby was active in other political and social campaign. Chief among these was the development of education, and he was an early advocate of university education in Wales. For example, in December 1870 he joined with Thomas Price, John Griffiths (Gohebydd) and others in addressing a public meeting on the subject at Aberdare. Jones also played a prominent role in Liberal politics in his native Breconshire, which was captured from the Conservatives by William Fuller- Maitland at an 1875 by-election, and became a safe Liberal seat thereafter. Kilsby Jones was actively involved in that campaign. Family On 22 April 1842 Jones married Ann Southwall Chilcott of Leominster, who survived him. They had one son, Ryse Valentine Chilcott. Kilsby Jones died on 10 April 1889, and was buried in the parish churchyard at Llanwrtyd, where a monument was placed over his grave by public subscription. Works Revd James Rhys Kilsby Jones (1813-89) NLW3365076 Jones preached in Welsh or English, had a reputation as a lecturer, and employed a biting wit. His best-known subjects were \\"Vicar Prichard\\", John Penry, and \\"Self-made Men\\". He was a resolute enemy of the church establishment in Wales, and a Liberal. Jones translated into English William Rees's Memoirs of the late W. Williams of Wern, London, 1846; and into Welsh The second Letter on the present Defective State of Education in Wales, by W. Williams, M.P. for Lambeth, with a sketch of the educational policy of the government, Llanelly, 1848, and John Brown's Biblical Dictionary as Geiriadur Beiblaidd, Glasgow, 1869‚Äì70.

He published A Lecture on the Educational Wants of Wales, 1851; and \\"An Essay on the Characteristics of Welsh Preaching\\" was included in Echoes from the Welsh Hills, by the Rev. David Davies, London, 1883. Jones was also joint author with Dr. R. Richardson of Rhayadr of Breconshire and Radnorshire Mineral Springs, Llanidloes, 1860. Jones contributed to Welsh periodicals, beginning while at Kilsby with articles on political, social, and educational questions in Y Traethodydd and Y Byd Cymreig.

In the same year Mr Barrett-Lennard entered into a partnership with Manuel and took over the management of the property. The stocking rate later the same year had increased to 5,000 sheep and 300 head of cattle. By 1902 Samuel Phillips had bought into the station in partnership with Manuel. In 1904 it was owned by Forrest, Emanuel and Company and was running 1,000 head of cattle and a flock of about 6,000 sheep.

The Hursts were conducting regeneration experiments on the property to assist with land recovery from the effect of rabbits. The Axford family bought the station in 2000. It was stocked with 11,000 merino sheep and 158 shorthorn cattle. After suffering problems with feral dog attacks on the sheep that reduced the size of the flock to 600, the Axfords switched to cattle. By 2011 the property was running about 1,700 head of cattle, and was sold to a Tuna farmer. The Axfords were still running the station in 2013.

A 5-part film compilation series premiered starting from November 29, 2019. Plot summary In Regild Century 1014, 1,014 years after the end of the Universal CenturyGundam Reconguista in G, Episode #17 - The character Col. Rusita directly states onscreen that the Universal Century was \\"[the] previous era,\\" relative to the Regild Century, referring to how the conflicts of the UC are once again starting to spill over into the Regild Century. Subsequently, in episode #24, Klim Nick heatedly refers to how irresponsible it would be to trust the Dorette Fleet in their battle against the Capital Army, still being recently \\"burdened [by the] trauma of the Universal Century's wars.\\", a young member of the Capital Guard named , charged with protecting the orbital elevator Capital Tower, encounters and helps capture a highly advanced mobile suit, the G-Self and its pilot, , while defending the tower from space pirates called the Pirate Corps. Feeling a connection with both the G-Self and its pilot, Bellri is able to control the mobile suit, operable only by a select few. The G-Self is recaptured by the Amerian spaceship Megafauna, and Bellri subsequently helps fend off attacks by the \\"Capital Army\\" - a militaristic faction from the Capital Tower advocating for rearmament, led by Colonel Cumpa Rusita - and its eccentric Captain Mask. The Megafauna returns to the Capital Territory to negotiate a ceasefire and alliance to prepare for an alleged threat from space, but the unexpected launch of an Amerian fleet causes hostilities to resume. The Megafauna flees to space, arriving at the holy land of Sankt Porto atop the Capital Tower, which has been occupied by Amerian forces seeking control of utilities distributed by the Capital Territory. Recognizing the growing military strength of Earth's factions, the moon colony of Towasanga sends their Dorette Fleet to begin the \\"Reconguista\\", a recolonization of Earth. In the ensuing chaos, the Megafauna as well as a pair of Amerian and Capital Army ships journey to the moon. At Towasanga, Bellri and Aida learn that they are the last surviving members of the royal Rayhunton family, sent to earth as children to protect them from the Dorette Fleet. Seeking the truth behind the conflict, Aida commands the Megafauna to the Venus Globe colonies, the source of the Photon Batteries and other advanced technology that has led to Earth's rapid militarization. After a battle with the G-IT Corps - another faction supporting the Reconguistra - they discover Cumpa Rusita is the Towasangan who brought them to Earth and provided Earthnoids with the blueprints for spaceships and mobile suits with the intention of spurring armed conflict and strengthening the human race. The Megafauna returns to Earth with upgraded mobile suits and finds the war has escalated further. Ameria has allied with the Dorette Fleet while Captain Mask allies with the G-IT Corps to ensure his historically oppressed race has a place in the new world order. A chaotic final battle ensues at the Guiana Highlands among the remains of the past wars and Cumpa Rusita is killed in the crossfire between Bellri and Captain Mask. Having rediscovered the horrors of war throughout their adventures, the crew of the Megafauna force a ceasefire with technology from the Universal Century. Some months later, a joint crew of Earthnoids and Spacenoids from multiple nations start a journey around the world to promote peace and understanding. Bellri disembarks in Japan and climbs Mount Fuji, intending to see the world on his own two feet.

Previously, in November 2010, Tomino had previewed an unfinished novel in the 100th issue of Gundam Ace called , which revolved around a space elevator with similar characters and settings. The scenario for the show was completed and the anime began full production in 2012. Reconguista in G was officially unveiled at the Gundam 35th Anniversary event on March 20, 2014. During the unveiling, Tomino explained the \\"G\\" stands for \\"Gundam,\\" but primarily means \\"ground.\\" He also explained the word \\"reconguista\\" is based on the Spanish word reconquista; however, the Japanese audience prefers a voiced \\"g\\" in the title which necessitated the change. =Staff= Gundam Reconguista in G is Yoshiyuki Tomino's first major original animated work since The Wings of Rean in 2004, though he had directed a CGI short for Gundam's 30th anniversary in 2009 called Ring of Gundam. The character designs of the series are by Kenichi Yoshida, who had his first character designs credit in Tomino's Overman King Gainer. The mechanical designs are by Akira Yasuda, who previously worked with Tomino as a character designer in Turn A Gundam and mecha designer in Overman King Gainer, Kimitoshi Yamane, who also worked with Tomino in Overman King Gainer, and Ippei Gy≈çbu, an advertising illustrator who was working on his first mechanical designs. Yuugo Kanno is the composer of the music. =Short film= A short film with 3D CGI mecha scenes was released on May 21, 2015, featuring a battle between G-Self and G-Arcane, and the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 03 Phenex from Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn.

Core Fighter\\", which premiered on November 29, 2019. The second film is titled \\"Bellri's Fierce Charge\\", which premiered on February 21, 2020. However, the second film and the rest of the sequels are delayed due to the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Release The first three episodes were compiled for preview screenings in limited Japanese theaters starting August 23, 2014. This film was made available on the Japanese streaming website Docomo Anime Store in September 2014.

Maxi Boost ON and later supplanted by the G-Arcane with the full dress and G-Self again with the Perfect pack. In Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. 2, the Montero(Klim Nick's unit) is a playable unit and later supplanted by the G-Lucifer. Reception The reaction to the series was mixed. Toshio Okada, a co-founder and former president of Gainax, has voiced concerns regarding the show's comprehensibility. He stated that \\"Ordinary people watch this and don't know what's happening,\\" and \\"It's fine to make it for today's kids, but who does he think kids today are? Who does he think the kids that watch Yo-kai Watch are?\\" Lauren Orsini of Anime News Network criticized it in her review of the Gundam series as a whole. Stating \\"The storytelling is so confusing, it may take the entire series for you to figure out what's going on.\\" She recommended against watching it entirely. Meanwhile, Japanese social critic and editor-in-chief of the PLANETS magazine, Uno Tsunehiro, gave it a highly positive critical response, stating that \\"[It is] in my humble opinion, this disorientation is somewhat intended... What we see here may be an intense message that goes against the times.\\" He went on to state that it reflects the dilemmas that humanity faced in the 20th century, and how technology and digital age culture has made us lose our ability to perceive and understand these detached realities. Likewise, writer Gen Urobuchi wrote a highly positive critical response to it, stating \\"If there are infinite possibilities in writing, is it possible to write a story about the potential danger of stories? A story that renounces stories? Yes, it is. Reconguista of G did it\\", and \\"When I saw the end credits I was just moved, and exclaimed \\" they did it!\\". I had been worried about the limits of storytelling and was just thankful for this slap from a veteran creator to me. Reconguista of G made me genki.\\" In April 2015, Tomino responding to criticisms offered an apology to those who did not comprehend the story, stating \\"If I was told that it wasn't understandable because I was bad, all I could say is, 'I'm sorry,'\\". Commercially the series was a success. The limited-edition Blu-ray debuted 15th on the Oricon chart, with 3,864 units sold during the first week. The second volume of the Blu-ray debuted 4th on the Oricon chart, with 7,322 units sold in the first week. According to the Oricon chart, Gundam Reconguista in G ranked as the 22nd best selling anime of 2015 with 76,419 units sold in total.

Early life Snell was born 27 November 1820, in Barnstaple, Devon,Griffiths, T. 2007, 'Edward Snell 1820-1880', in (ed.), Dictionary of Australian Artists Online, Australian Government Publishing Service, Australia grandson of William Snell, a serge manufacturer of Crediton, Devon and the son of Edward Snell, a silversmith, jeweler, watch and clockmaker in High Street Barnstable, and Elizabeth, n√©e Stothert.John Cattell, EDWARD SNELL'S DIARY: A JOURNEYMAN ENGINEER IN BATH IN THE 1840s Snell was the eldest of four children, having three sisters, Rose Emily (known as Emily), Emma and Elizabeth (known as Lizzie). His father died in 1827 at age 33, when Snell was only aged six, leaving their mother to raise them in financial difficulty despite the ¬£1500 realized from the sale of the family business, High Street shop and house above it. Snell's maternal grandfather, Abel Stothert, was a cutler from Shaftesbury, whose brother was George Stothert, who established the Stothert ironmongery business in Bath around 1785, and his son George junior (1786-1858) who established the Horse Street Foundry in 1815, which subsequently grew into the important British engineering firm Stothert & Pitt. George Stothert played an important role in encouraging and helping his young cousin Edward Snell in his engineering career. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed as an engineer and millwright to the Stothert's Bath foundry in the renamed Newark Street under George's younger half-brother Henry Stothert, completing his indenture on 16 March 1842. Most of his work was on projects around Bath, but sometimes extending as far as Newbury. Henry arranged for him to take up a position at the Avonside Ironworks in Bristol in May 1842, which had been established by Henry in 1837. He was not happy here, however, and gave notice after just three weeks, complaining of the low wages (20 shillings per week) and the tyrannical regime in the workshop. Despite the resulting animosity from both Henry and George Stothert, George used his influence with the Locomotive superintendent Daniel Gooch to gain a position for Snell at the Great Western Railway Company Swindon workshops on 28 February 1843. Here he had the position of head draughtsman and then rose to deputy works manager. Museum of the Great Western Railway ‚Äì Steam 2014 He stayed at the GWR in Swindon for six years apart from a short stint in 1844 at Penn's marine engineering works in Greenwich. Migration to Australia A reduction in wages brought about by the post railway mania crash of 1848-9, caused him to decide to emigrate to Australia at the age of 29 with his friend Edward Prowse, having considered America. He arrived in Adelaide on the Bolton on 29 November 1849, recording in his diary: When I was 21 I calculated on making a small fortune by the time I was 30 but have made little headway in that line as yet. Snell spent some time in South Australia surveying and painting, spending three months on the Yorke Peninsula in 1850, then around Lake Alexandrina at the Murray River mouth. He produced a Plan for the Grand Junction Canal between Adelaide and the North Arm in August 1851. Gold digging and family On 4 March 1852 he arrived at the Castlemaine diggings where he amassed ¬£341 worth of gold in five months.Griffiths, Tom and Alan Platt, 'Edward Snell: Sketching a Fortune', in Iain McCalman, Alexander Cook and Andrew Reeves (eds), Gold: forgotten histories and lost objects of Australia, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001 Snell married Charlotte Elizabeth Bayley in Geelong on 23 June 1853, and the pair had 9 children, the first of whom Emily Charlotte died as an infant, but the other eight survived to adulthood. Railway work It was Snell's work as engineer for the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company, from 1853 until he resigned in October 1857, that established his fortune, for which he had been paid more than ¬£17,000. His designs included a substantial terminal station and workshops at Geelong (which were only partly realised).'First Geelong railway terminus', Edward Snell 1820-1880, artist. ca. 1854, pencil and ink on buff paper; 18 x 26 cm. State Library of Victoria Accession no(s) H8286 However, his railway work was not without controversy as he was criticised for the inadequacy of the engineering, with light timber bridges requiring extra maintenance and having a short life span, and the decision to build only a single track leading to slow and infrequent trains, and travelers between Melbourne and Geelong continued to prefer the bay steamers across Port Phillip Bay leading to diminished profits for the company.\\"Ergo, Edward Snell\\" State Library of Victoria Snell gave evidence at a number of railway commission enquiries, defending his approach as necessary to complete the work in time, with the expectation that the engineering works would be upgraded as traffic and revenue increased. In reply to the presentation and testimony given to him by the Company in March 1858, he again highlighted the problems of building \\"a new undertaking, in a new country, and surrounded by innumerable difficulties.\\" The railway also had the misfortune of a fatal accident on its first run. The company's superintendent ‚Äì and a friend of Snell's ‚Äì was struck when leaning out of the train's engine as it approached a tunnel. An inquiry cleared the company of any negligence. Private practice Snell also undertook private work as a surveyor and engineer. He formed a partnership with Frederick (German Friedrich) Ferdinand KawerauGerman wikipedia, Diskussion:Friedrich Ferdinand Kawerau on 1 January 1853, which prospered for a time, but was dissolved in the 1854, and later a partnership with Edward Prowse, which was dissolved in 1855, both of whom became prominent architects in Geelong.Huddle, Lorraine, 1983-03, Architects of early Geelong [Series of parts] Parts 4-7 Investigator, Vols. 18 Snell was an avid reader and self educator, joining the Adelaide and Geelong Mechanics Institutes; he became a member of the Geelong Society of Architects, Engineers and Surveyors; and the Philosophical Institute of Victoria in 1857 (later the Royal Society of Victoria) Later life Snell returned to England in 1858 with his family on the Norfolk, to a life of retirement, having amassed the fortune that was his intention, and secured a considerable income of around ¬£300 per annum. In retirement he undertook his own reading and invented a 'stockless' ship's anchor. In the 1870s he converted to spiritualism, gaining some notoriety in Bath.

Phagocytosis of an otherwise-viable cell may occur because the cell is recognised as stressed, activated, senescent, damaged, pathogenic or non-self, or is misrecognised. Cells are phagocytosed as a result of: i) expressing eat-me signals on their surface, ii) losing don‚Äôt-eat-me signals, and/or iii) binding of opsonins. It is clear that otherwise-viable cells can expose/bind such phagocytosis-promoting signals as a result of cell stress, activation or senescence. Phagoptosis is probably the most common form of cell death in the body as it is responsible for erythrocyte turnover. And there is increasing evidence that it mediates physiological death of neutrophils, T cells, platelets and stem cells, and thereby regulates inflammation, immunity, clotting and neurogenesis. Phagoptosis is a major form of host defence against pathogens and cancer cells. However, recent evidence indicates that excessive phagoptosis may kill host cells in inflammatory conditions, contributing to haemophagic conditions, and neuronal loss in the inflamed brain.  Mechanism  Phagoptosis is normally caused by: the cell exposing on its surface so-called \\"eat-me\\" signals, and/or the cell no longer exposing \\"don't-eat-me\\" signals and/or the cell being opsonised i.e. binding soluble proteins that tag the cell for phagocytosis. For example, phosphatidylserine is an \\"eat-me\\" signal that, when exposed on the surface of a cell, triggers phagocytes (i.e. cells that eat other cells) to eat that cell. Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the inside of healthy cells, but can become exposed on the surface of dying, activated or stressed cells. Phagocytosis of such cells requires specific receptors on the phagocyte that recognise either phosphatidylserine directly or opsonins bound to the phosphatidylserine or other \\"eat-me\\" signals, such as calreticulin. \\"Don't-eat-me\\" signals include CD47, which when expressed on the surface of a cell, inhibit phagocytosis of that cell, by activating SIRP-alpha receptors on the phagocyte. Opsonins are normally soluble proteins, which when bound to the surface of a cell induce phagocytes to phagocytose that cell. Opsonins include Mfge8, Gas6, Protein S, antibodies and complement factors C1q and C3b.  Functions  Phagoptosis has multiple functions including removal and disposal of: pathogenic cells, aged cells, damaged cells, stressed cells and activated cells. Pathogenic cells such as bacteria can be opsonised by antibodies or complement factors, enabling their phagocytosis and phagoptosis by macrophages and neutrophils. \\"Aged\\" erythrocytes and neutrophils, as well as \\"activated\\" platelets, neutrophils and T-cells, are thought to be phagocytosed alive by macrophages. Development. Phagoptosis removes excess cells during development in the worm, C. elegans.Hoeppner, D.J. et al (2001). Engulfment genes cooperate with ced-3 to promote cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans. Nature 412, 202-206Reddien, P. et al (2001). Phagocytosis promotes programmed cell death in C. elegans. Nature 412, 198-202 During mammalian development multiple cells undergo programmed cell senescence and are then phagocytosed by macrophages.Mu√±oz-Esp√≠n D et al Programmed cell senescence during mammalian embryonic development. Cell. 2013;155:1104-18. Brain macrophages (microglia) can regulate the number of neural precursor cells in the developing brain by phagocytosing these otherwise viable precursors and thus limiting neurogenesis.Cunningham, C. L., Martinez-Cerdeno, V. & Noctor, S. C. Microglia Regulate the Number of Neural Precursor Cells in the Developing Cerebral Cortex. Journal of Neuroscience 33, 4216‚Äì4233 (2013). Turnover of blood cells. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) live for roughly 3 months in the blood before being phagocytksed by macrophages. Old erythrocytes do not die, but rather display changes in the cell surface that enable macrophages to recognise them as old or damaged, including exposure of phosphatidylserine, desialylation of glycoproteins, loss or changed conformation of the \\"don't-eat-me\\" signal CD47, and exposure of novel antigens that bind endogenous antibodies.Lutz HU, Bogdanova A. Mechanisms tagging senescent red blood cells for clearance in healthy humans. Front Physiol. 2013;4:387 Neutrophils have a daily rhythm of entry and exit from the blood, driven by neutrophil ‚Äúaging‚Äù in the circulation, causing decreased expression of CD62L and increased expression of CXCR4, which directs the ‚Äúaged‚Äù neutrophils to the bone marrow, where they are phagocytosed by macrophages.Casanova-Acebes M, et al. Rhythmic Modulation of the Hematopoietic Niche through Neutrophil Clearance. Cell. 2013;153:1025-35. However, it is still unclear how or why neutrophils turnover at such an enormous rate. Antigen recognition causes phosphatidylserine exposure on activated T-cells, which is recognized by Tim-4 on macrophages, inducing phagoptosis of the activated T-cells, and thus the contraction phase of the adaptive response.Albacker, L.A. et al (2010) TIM-4, a receptor for phosphatidylserine, controls adaptive immunity by regulating the removal of antigen-specific T cells. J Immunol. 185, 6839-49 Host defence against pathogens. Phagocytosis of otherwise-viable pathogens, such as bacteria, can be mediated by neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, microglia and dendritic cells, and is central to host defence against pathogens.Lovewell RR, Patankar YR, Berwin B. Mechanisms of phagocytosis and host clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2014 306:L591-603. Mayadas TN, Cullere X, Lowell CA. The multifaceted functions of neutrophils. Annu Rev Pathol. 2014;9:181-218. Dendritic cells can phagocytose viable neutrophils, and present antigens derived from bacteria or cancer cell debris previously phagocytosed by the neutrophils.Alfaro C et al. Dendritic cells take up and present antigens from viable and apoptotic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. PLoS One. 2011;6:e29300. Thus phagoptosis can contribute to host defence in a variety of ways. Host defence against cancer. It has been known for some time that animals defend themselves against cancer by antibody-mediated or antibody-independent phagocytosis of viable tumour cells by macrophages. Recognition of viable cancer cells for phagocytosis may be based on the expression of novel antigens, senescence markers, phosphatidylserine or calreticulin. More recently it has become clear that most human cancer cells overexpress CD47 on their surface to prevent themselves being phagocytosed, and that if this ‚Äòdon‚Äôt-eat-me‚Äô signalling is blocked then a variety of cancers can be cleared from the body.Chao MP, Majeti R, Weissman IL. Programmed cell removal: a new obstacle in the road to developing cancer. Nat Rev Cancer. 2011 Dec 8;12(1):58-67. Thus it would appear that phagoptosis is an important defence against cancer, but that tumour cells can suppress this, and blocking this suppression is an attractive therapeutic option. Pathological phagoptosis of blood cells. Hemophagocytosis is a clinical condition, found in many infectious and inflammatory disorders, where activated macrophages have engulfed apparently viable blood cells, resulting in reduced white or red cell count (cytopenia). IFN-Œ≥ (and possibly other cytokines) appears to drive hemophagocytosis during infection by directly stimulating phagoptosis of blood cells by macrophages.Zoller, E.E. et al (2011) Hemophagocytosis causes a consumptive anemia of inflammation. J Exp Med. 208, 1203-14 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by excessive engulfment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by bone marrow macrophages, and this has been found to result from down regulation of CD47 expression on HSCs, enabling macrophages to eat them alive.Kuriyama T et al (2012) Engulfment of hematopoietic stem cells caused by down-regulation of CD47 is critical in the pathogenesis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Blood 120:4058-67. Pathological phagoptosis in the brain. Microglial phagocytosis of stressed- but-viable neurons occurs under inflammatory conditions, and may contribute to neuronal loss in brain pathologies [2].

National Workers' Savings Bank (1971-1989) (In Finnish; Suomen Ty√∂v√§en S√§√§st√∂pankki, in Swedish; Arbetarsparbanken) or STS-Bank (1989-1992) was a Finnish savings bank and commercial bank. Workers' savings banks were syndicalist, social democratic corporations intended to compete with privately owned banks, which could deny credit to workers on political grounds. Created in 1971 through a merger of five local workers' savings banks, the oldest component of STS was the Helsinki branch, founded in 1909. The Turku workers' savings bank was the only one to choose to stay independent. With the merger, STS became the largest savings bank in Finland. The bank went almost bankrupt in 1992 and was sold at a loss to KOP (later Nordea), with the government taking care of much of the bad debt. In 1899, the Finnish Worker's Party (later SDP) decided in its general meeting to establish a bank. The Helsinki TS, was founded in 1908 by Albin Karjalainen, the financial officer of the party organ. The main motivation were the problems encountered with the finances of the party organ and building a house for the society. Both required loans, but commercial banks refused to lend for political reasons.http://www.tyovaenperinne.fi/tyovaentutkimus/2003/TK_sts.html For much of its history, it functioned efficiently as a savings bank with a working class (principally construction workers) clientele. President of Finland Mauno Koivisto was the CEO of STS in 1959-1968. The \\"casino economy\\" craze of the late 1980s caught on also at STS. In 1989, the bank was transformed into a commercial bank, and foundations controlled by the leftist political parties SDP and SKP bought shares, intending to fund their activities with the profits of the bank. However, loose credit policies and the subsequent credit loss due to the early 1990s recession were disastrous for the bank. Esko Sepp√§nen has opined that STS had become a sort of a \\"cash dispenser\\" from which clients could get cash without any strict payback obligation. As much as 40% of the loans were given against the bank's own policies, and 22% had indications of deliberate abuse.http://pankkikriisi.blogspot.fi/2008/11/punapoman- romahdus.html STS was one of the main contributors to the early 1990s banking crisis in Finland, where the country was at the brink of a banking system and economic collapse. In 1992, in addition to the official loss of 500 million markka (Mmk), concealed was 740 Mmk bad debt, 700 Mmk asset overvaluation and 300 Mmk miscellaneous losses. Furthermore, STS had borrowed ¬Ω billion to the cooperative retailer EKA and the construction company Haka, both bound for bankruptcy. An assetless shell, Siltapankki Oy, remained with the bad debt. Facing bankruptcy, the remaining parts were sold in 1992 to another major bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, which took over the operations and terminated its independent brand and existence. The owning foundation received only 75 million markka in the form of KOP shares (itself ripe for bankruptcy), thus leading to an immediate loss of 175 million markka (ca. 30 million euro).http://palkansaajasaatio.fi/ The government merged Siltapankki with the bad bank Arsenal in 1995. All savings customers were fully refunded. The total cost to taxpayers was ca. 2 billion Finnish markka (around 0.5 billion in 2010 euros) according to Esko Sepp√§nen. The last CEO of the bank was Ulf Sundqvist, a prominent SDP politician and the party president in 1991-1993. The allegations and protracted court cases due to the STS collapse damaged his career, preventing ascendancy to prime minister. Sundquist was eventually convicted of debtor's dishonesty (a felony of hiding assets from creditors), with his appeal denied by the Supreme Court in 2001. The minister involved on behalf of the government, Arja Alho, was forced to resign for negotiating the settlement poorly.Helsingin Sanomat. Sundqvist conviction stays in force. 11.4.2001. http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20010411IE6 Other involved members of the board were given no opportunity to settle, and if the same standard had been applied to Sundquist, he would have been ordered to pay 5.7 million instead of 1.8 million in damages. The modern successor of KOP and thus STS is Nordea. The holding foundation still exists as Palkansaajas√§√§ti√∂, which maintains the STS museum.

He was previously the chief executive officer (CEO) of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), a FTSE 100 company, from October 2013 to October 2019. Early life and education McEwan was educated at Hastings Boys' High School, Hastings, followed by Massey University, where he completed a degree in business studies and human resources, despite having failed an accountancy module twice. He later earned a master in business administration from the Harvard Business School. Career McEwan's first top management position was as CEO of Axa New Zealand from 1996 to 2002. He had spent the previous ten years at National Mutual New Zealand, 51% acquired by Axa in 1995. McEwan was then appointed CEO of First NZ Securities, the stockbroking arm of First NZ Capital Securities, the New Zealand affiliate of Credit Suisse Group. In 2003 McEwan was hired as group executive for retail banking services for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). He had been expected to become the next CEO of CBA, but was passed over for the post in 2011. McEwan joined RBS in August 2012 as head of retail banking. = CEO of RBS = McEwan was appointed CEO of RBS in October 2013. It was expected that he would move the bank away from investment banking and reduce its international exposure, to focus more on UK retail banking. In February‚ÄìMarch 2014, McEwan attracted press coverage for his view that \\"free banking\\" (no current account charges for customers in credit) would have to end sooner or later, and that this would in turn lead to greater transparency from the banks about how they funded their operations. On 25 February 2015, RBS announced that McEwan would forgo a share award worth ¬£1m saying that he did not want his pay package to \\"be a distraction from the task of building a great bank\\". He is still expected to be paid ¬£2.7m despite turning down the award. The announcement came the day before the bank, which is 80% owned by the UK government, was due to release annual results widely expected to be disappointing following a series of fines by banking regulators for failures including for failing to stop manipulation of the foreign exchange market. In 2018 McEwan was requested by the Treasury Committee in the United Kingdom to explain how RBS's Global Reconstruction Group (GRG) had handled its dealings with small businesses from 2008 to 2014. British MP Nicky Morgan, then chair of the committee wrote in reply to McEwan's written submission that it was 'concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. Mr McEwan‚Äôs letter to me is an example of this...' = Resignation from RBS = In April 2019, McEwan announced his shock resignation on the eve of RBS‚Äôs AGM and first quarter results. McEwan has a twelve month notice period, and committed himself to remain in situ until a suitable successor was found. Upon his resignation, Chairman Howard Davis commended McEwan on his turn around of the part-nationalised lender, noting ‚Äúhis successful execution of the strategy to refocus the bank back on its core markets here in the UK and Ireland has helped to deliver one of the biggest UK corporate turnarounds in history.‚Äù During his tenure as CEO, he focused his work on modernising and simplifying the bank's IT system, and launched many fintech startups to race at the leading-edge of banking innovation. McEwan was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to the financial sector. = Move to National Australia Bank = National Australia Bank announced on 19 July 2019, the appointment of Ross McEwan as Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director. NAB chairman-elect Philip Chronican said NAB had secured a senior, global financial services executive with deep experience in international markets and long-standing knowledge of the Australian banking environment. Personal life McEwan and his wife Stephanie met through playing basketball, while they were both students at Massey University. She has a degree in food technology and they have two adult daughters. They own a farm in New Zealand.

Early life Colin Gill was born at Bexleyheath in Kent. He studied at the Slade School of Art, and in 1913 became the first recipient of the Rome Scholarship in Decorative Painting to the British School in Rome. First World War Heavy Artillery (Art.IWM ART 2274) At the start of World War I, Gill joined the Royal Garrison Artillery and served with them on the Western Front as a second lieutenant with the 17th Heavy Battery until 1916, when he was seconded to the Royal Engineers to work as a front-line camouflage officer. He was invalided back to England, with gas poisoning in March 1918, and spent several months recovering at the Hospital for Officers on the Isle of Wight. In May 1918, he offered his services as a war artist but, initially was turned down and continued to work as a camouflage instructor. After, the British War Memorials Committee did commission Gill to produce a large work for the proposed, but never built Hall of Remembrance, he was released from his duties at the Camouflage School and returned to France on 7 November 1918 to do sketches, and other work, for his BWMC commission. He stayed in France until 14 December 1918, visiting Mons only hours after it had been retaken by the Allies. At the front, Gill spent a week stationed in an artillery battery, where he suffered from frostbite. The visit to France resulted in the paintings Evening, After a Push and Heavy Artillery, the painting intended for the Hall of Remembrance and, later, Canadian Observation Post for the Canadian War Memorials scheme. For Heavy Artillery, Gill drew on his experience as a camouflage officer;- the two large howitzers in the painting both have a patchwork camouflage design and are covered in green netting to avoid detection by enemy aircraft. Later life Allegro (1921), oil on canvas, 46 x 90 inches By 1919, Gill had returned to the British School in Rome. Gill first exhibited with New English Art Club in 1914 and eventually became a member of the group in 1926. He also showed works at the Royal Academy from 1924 onwards and taught painting at the Royal College of Art from 1922 until 1925. Between 1925 and 1927, Gill worked on a large mural, King Alfred's long-ships defeat the Danes, 877, for St. Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster. This was followed by mural commissions for the Bank of England, Essex County Hall in Chelmsford and Northampton Guildhall. In the early thirties, he had an affair with Mabel Lethbridge, a Great War heroine and writer, while occupying a studio on the first floor of her Chelsea home. Her daughter Sue is the child model for Gill's 1934 painting The Kerry Flute PlayerLiss Llewellyn Fine Art catalogue entry for 'Study for The Kerry Flute Player' 1934. In 1938, under the name Richard Saxby, Gill with his wife Una Long published the book Five Came to London. In 1939, he received a commission to paint murals at the Johannesburg Magistrates' Courts and it was in South Africa, in November 1940, that he died, aged 48, of an illness.
