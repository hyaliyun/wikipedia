A feminist pioneer, she was a leader of the suffrage campaign in Brazil. She was also linked to the Brazilian modernist movement and was a staunch defender of Communist ideals. She was married to the poet and writer √Ålvaro Moreyra, who played a major role in the renewal of the Brazilian theater, organizing cultural popularization campaigns and working as an actress, director, translator, declaimer and later president of the union of theater professionals. Biography =Early life and career= Eug√™nia Brand√£o was born in Juiz de Fora in 1898. Daughter of Dr. Armindo Gomes Brand√£o and Marie Antoinette Armond Brand√£o, and granddaughter of Baron Pitangui, she had a comfortable childhood in her hometown, but with the death of Armindo, her family began to face financial difficulties. As her mother could not claim the inheritance left by her husband, which by law should be under the responsibility of her sons, she moved with Eug√™nia to Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1910s in search of employment. She found work at a branch of the Post Office nearby Lapa, while her daughter, autodidact, learned to read and write in Portuguese and French while reading newspapers, books and dictionaries. Eug√™nia got her first job at fifteen as seller of male and female articles at Magazin Parc Royal store, downtown Rio. Shortly after, she began working as clerk at Freitas Bastos, a bookstore located at Largo da Carioca. It is there, amongst the beautiful works of national and international authors, that she became fond of theater and literature. At sixteen, she was fully integrated into the bohemian life of the city, including behavior and costumes - smoking cigarillos, she walked by the streets dressed in a suit, tie, and fedora. It is like this that she introduced herself at the newspaper √öltima Hora, looking for a job as journalist. Hired by her well-written text and daring attitude, her recruitment caused bewilderment and admiration in a society hitherto accustomed to seeing females presented by the media only as poetesses, feuilletists, and columnists. A woman practicing journalism was even more unusual, up to the point that even the term \\"reportess\\" had to be coined to describe her role. Shortly after, the journal prematurely reported the end of her career as a young journalist, who had decided to seek refuge in a boarding school for girls in an orphanage called Asilo Bom Pastor. The mystery and the reason for such decision were unraveled only months later, when a report signed by her was published on the front page of the Journal A Rua. As a matter of fact, Eugenia asked to be interned with the sole intention of interviewing Albertina do Nascimento Silva, the sister of a murdered woman in a widely reported crime which became known as \\"The Tragedy of Dr. Januzzi Street, 13.\\" The woman, however, had already been removed from the asylum, but Eug√™nia continued living on the site in an attempt to obtain information from other inmates. Not being successful, she took the opportunity to report the everyday life of those people in their restrictive confinement. The resulting series of articles, published in chapters for five days in a row, snatched a large number of readers, yielding to the author the deserved recognition from colleagues, competitors and the general public, which would come to nickname her as \\"the first reporter of Brazil\\". Before getting married and temporarily abandon her profession, Eug√™nia circulated by the newsroom of two other famous newspapers of that time, A Not√≠cia and O Pa√≠s. =Marriage and political and cultural life= From left to right: Pagu, Elsie Lessa, Tarsila do Amaral, Anita Malfatti and Eug√™nia √Ålvaro Moreyra at the Modern Art Week of 1922. At the height of her career as a street reporter, Eug√™nia met the poet √Ålvaro Moreyra, who attended the same intellectual and bohemian circles. In love, they got married in 1914. Eug√™nia then adopted her husband's name and surname, and left her journalistic career on hold to devote to her new family life. The couple had eight children, four of which survived infancy: Sandro Luciano, Jo√£o Paulo, √Ålvaro Samuel and Rosa Marina. She participated in the Modern Art Week of 1922, and founded with him in 1927 the Teatro de Brinquedo (Toy Theatre Group), whose intent was to manifest modernist ideas. Between 1928 and 1932, she made several excursions to the countryside and outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, introducing the public to modern European authors. With the fragmentation of the Brazilian modernist movement after the Revolution of 1930, Eug√™nia went on to defend along with Alvaro Moreyra, Pag√∫ and Oswald de Andrade, leftist positions, actively participating in the Alian√ßa Nacional Libertadora (National Liberation Alliance), consequently being persecuted by the Vargas government. Influenced by Carlos Lacerda, Eug√™nia and Alvaro affiliate themselves to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCB), and in May 1935 she joined the group of founders of the Uni√£o Feminina do Brasil (Women's Union of Brazil), an organization promoted by women members or sympathizers of the PCB. Her house at that time had become a meeting place for bohemians and intellectuals, and among the many attendees were Di Cavalcanti, Vinicius de Morais, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Graciliano Ramos and Jorge Amado. The Moreyra couple, in a caricature of Brazilian artist Alvarus (1920). In November 1935, after the Communist Conspiracy movement, Eug√™nia was detained and accused of involvement with the PCB. She remained about four months in the House of Detention on Frei Caneca street, where she shared the cell no. 4 with communist militant Olga Ben√°rio Prestes, Maria Werneck de Castro, Nise da Silveira, Armanda √Ålvaro Alberto and Eneida de Moraes. She was released for lack of evidence on the morning of February 1, 1936. She then returned to political activism, engaging herself, among other activities, in a campaign for the release of Anita Leocadia, Olga Ben√°rio's baby who was born after her deportation to a concentration camp in Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. In 1937, √Ålvaro presented to the theater department commission of the Ministry of Education and Culture his plan for the organization of a \\"Brazilian Dramatic Company\\", which was approved. He and his wife then toured the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, subsequently performing a three-month season at Teatro Regina, in Rio de Janeiro. =Unionist activity and death= Between 1936 and 1938, Eug√™nia was president of Casa dos Artista, the union of the theatrical class in S√£o Paulo. Elected for a new term in February 1939, she was prevented from taking office by Filinto M√ºller, who filled to the Ministry of Labour and Employment a complaint that she was a \\"communist person mentioned at the Police Department of Security and Social Policy\\". The election was overruled by direct order of Minister Valdemar Falc√£o. She even ran for congresswoman in the general elections of 1945 but at the time no woman could be elected to represent women's interests during the drafting of the Brazilian Constitution of 1946. On June 16, 1948, Eug√™nia was home in Rio playing cards when she felt sick. She died shortly after in her bedroom, next to her children as a result of a stroke. She was then 50 years old. Legacy In a statement published in the newspaper Correio da Manh√£ after Eug√™nia's death, the writer Oswald de Andrade said that \\"what is due to her one day will be calculated\\". In reality, however, is that over the years the important and disruptive activities of Eug√™nia in a hitherto male-dominated society, specially in places such as the political and unionist sectors, became increasingly underestimated, and like this she remains a character still out of the history books - remembered, if at all, only by her pioneering altruism. After Alvaro's death in 1964, a significant number of photographs and clippings from newspapers and magazines about his wife was found in his personal files. The collection was partly used by him as a reference in the composition of the autobiographical book As Amargas, N√£o subsequently donated by his relatives to the Funda√ß√£o Casa de Rui Barbosa (House of Rui Barbosa Foundation).

Early life and TV news career Wise was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. Wise dropped out of high school at the age of fifteen upon the death of his father and begin work at a local radio station in Monroe, Louisiana. Although Wise earned a diploma by passing the high school equivalency test, he never graduated from college. In the 1940s and 1950s, Wise was a play-by-play sports announcer for Gordon McLendon's Liberty Broadcasting System radio network, which mainly broadcast live recreations of Major League Baseball games by means of broadcasters like Wise following the action via Western Union ticker tape reports, and then relaying the plays to the listening audience in a more lively style that included studio sound effects meant to simulate the ballgames. Wise went on to work for many years as a sports director at KRLD-TV, a Dallas CBS television affiliate. In 1960, he teamed with Davey O'Brien to call Dallas Cowboys games for CBS. Kennedy assassination During his CBS years, Wise also occasionally covered hard news. In particular, Wise provided on-the-spot coverage of the assassination of John F. Kennedy at the Dealey Plaza in Downtown Dallas on November 22, 1963. On November 23 at the Texas School Book Depository where Lee Harvey Oswald had worked, Wise encountered Jack Ruby who expressed concern that Jackie Kennedy might be required to return to Dallas if Oswald were tried for Kennedy's murder. Wise was present in the Dallas Municipal Building when Oswald was shot dead. Wise testified as a witness for both the defense and the prosecution at Jack Ruby's trial for the murder of Oswald. Wise is a co-author of the 2004 memoir When the News Went Live: Dallas 1963. Of Dallas during Kennedy's visit, Wise has said, \\"Let's face it: At the time, Dallas was considered a hotbed of right-wing hysteria. It served as the regional headquarters of the John Birch Society, and Gen. Edwin Walker - whom many considered a far-out extremist - had moved here. You might remember that Lee Harvey Oswald took a shot at him, too. H.L. Hunt's right-wing radio program originated here. So it was hardly a haven for liberals.\\" During his two terms as mayor of Dallas, Wise guided Dallas from under the cloud of the assassination and at the same time saved the Texas School Book Depository from imminent destruction, preserving it for further research into the president's murder.Douglass,James W.

He was headmaster and owner of Nissen's Girls' School (1872‚Äì1907/1903) and head of its affiliated women's teachers college, the first higher education institution open to women in Norway. He was also a lecturer at the Norwegian Military Academy. He was chairman of the Norwegian Santal Mission (1887‚Äì1907), in succession to Oscar Nissen, and the first editor-in-chief of its journal Santalen. He also wrote and edited several schoolbooks in Norwegian and German, including the reading book series L√¶sebog i Modersmaalet, that was one of the most widely used schoolbooks in Norway for over half a century. A village in India, Pauspur (Pausspur), was named in his honour. He was a member of the government-appointed committee which proposed the Higher School Act, adopted in 1896. The son of shipowner from Drammen Nicolai Nissen Pauss, he was married in his first marriage to Augusta Thoresen, a daughter of the timber merchant Hans Thoresen, and in his second marriage to Anna Henriette Wegner, a daughter of the industrialist Benjamin Wegner and Henriette Seyler, a member of the Berenberg banking dynasty of Hamburg.

In 1872 he succeeded the school's founder Hartvig Nissen as one of three co-owners and joint headmasters, and he ultimately became the sole owner and headmaster. In 1903, the school was sold to the company that owned the neighbouring Frogner School, but Nissen's Girls' School was managed independently and he remained as headmaster until his death four years later. During his time as headmaster, the school became the first in Norway to offer examen artium, the university entrance exam, for women. Nissen's Girls' School was also the first institution‚Äîahead of the University‚Äîto provide tertiary education for women in Norway, through its affiliated teachers college, headed by Pauss. During the late 19th century, the college educated a significant proportion of all female teachers in the country. He bought the property where the school is now located in Niels Juels gate 56 in 1897 and commissioned the construction of the school's new building, designed by Henrik Nissen.

The ship was renamed briefly Puerto Rico in 1938 and Monterey in 1939 to operate for the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company until requisitioned with transfer of title to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 25 September 1942. The ship was then allocated to the U.S. Army for operation under a bareboat agreement as USAT Monterey. In 1943 the ship was assigned to the command at Trinidad to supply bases in Brazil and Ascension Island. After layup in the reserve fleet the ship was sold to Turkey. Construction and design Haiti's keel was laid 4 April 1932 at Newport News Shipbuilding with launch on 17 September and delivery on 15 December, less than a month after delivery of her sister ship on 17 November 1932. The ships were designed by Theodore E. Ferris, the noted naval architect and marine engineer for the Emergency Fleet Corporation/United States Shipping Board responsible for that organization's designs. Construction of both Haiti and Colombia was financed by the United States Shipping Board's Bureau of Construction and Finance with a loan of $1,687,500 for each ship with the total cost of Haiti being $2,343,162.07. =Cargo and engineering= The ship was designed for a normal speed of 16 knots,Cited Pacific Marine Review article notes Colombia sea trials in which the ship achieved an average speed of just under 18.5 knots at 8,275 shaft horsepower over a course of 67.5 nautical miles. having refrigerated cargo capacity of , ventilated cargo capacity of and general cargo capacity of for a total of with a crew of 95. Propulsion was by three in series Newport News impulse turbines delivering up to a continuous 7,500 shaft horsepower through reduction gears to a single screw of diameter. Electricity for extensive use throughout the ship, including deck windlass, capstans, winches and watertight doors was supplied by three 250 kilowatt General Electric generator sets which also charged a storage battery bank for emergency power in case of main plant failure. Six cargo holds were served by cargo side ports for No. 3 and No. 4 with hatches for the balance with each of the two masts having four 5 ton booms and the foremast an additional 25 ton boom. =Passenger accommodations= Capacity was for 134 first and 24 tourist class passengers with first class spaces done in a \\"modern Spanish\\" motif with first class accommodations having twin beds and designed to meet hotel standards of the time. All had telephones and most were outside rooms with sliding glass windows or ports. A swimming pool was located on the bridge deck partially open and partially inside a verandah. Service history =Commercial 1932‚Äì1942= Haiti and sister ship Colombia provided scheduled commercial service on a route from New York to Port-au- Prince, Haiti, Kingston, Jamaica, Puerto Colombia and Cartagena, Colombia and Cristobal, Panama. After the ship's 1938‚Äì1939 transfer to the New York & Cuba Mail Steamship Company's Cuba Mail Line and renaming to Puerto Rico and then Monterey service included New York, Havana, Cuba and Vera Cruz, Mexico. =War Shipping Administration= Monterey was delivered by the New York & Cuba Mail Steamship Company to the War Shipping Administration on 14 February 1942 under a bareboat charter and operated by Atlantic, Gulf & West Indies Lines (AGWI Lines) acting as agent for WSA to meet Army transport requirements.

Title to the ship delivered to WSA on 25 September. Conversion of the ship to Navy requirements as prospective Alameda (AP-68) was cancelled when Navy found the ship unsuitable for the mission.The DANFS entry for Alameda (AP-68) mentions the owners of the much larger Matson liner; however, that ship, operated by WSA's agent Oceanic Steamship, was engaged in troop operations between New York and Halifax, Scotland and then at Casablanca. See MARAD status cards for that ship for operations during this period. Other possibilities were explored, including conversion to a combined operations flagship, but those were abandoned and Monterey returned to Army support. On 16 January the ship was delivered to the War Department for Army operation as USAT Monterey. Army operations in the West Indies and South Atlantic had been hampered by port congestion and transportation problems at the base in Trinidad into the spring of 1943 when a new 1,202-foot Army wharf, port and railway equipment improved operations. Along with the improvements the Transportation Corps command at Trinidad was assigned the USAT Monterey for direct support of Trinidad and bases in the West Indies, at Ascension Island and in Brazil. On 20 March 1946 the ship was again delivered to AGWI Lines for operation for WSA until laid up in the Reserve Fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia on 26 June and sale for $650,000 on 14 August 1947 to the Republic of with delivery to the buyer on 16 April 1948. =Turkish service= The ship was renamed Cankiri and then Adana after sale.

If provoked or threatened it can escape by doubling its normal walking speed using forward or backward flips similar to acrobatic flic-flac movements used by gymnasts. C. rechenbergi is the only spider known to use this unique form of rolling locomotion. The discovery of the Moroccan flic-flac spider has influenced biomimetic robot research, resulting in the development of an experimental robot based on the spider's motion.King, R.S. (2013). BiLBIQ: A Biologically Inspired Robot with Walking and Rolling Locomotion. Biosystems and Biorobotics. 2. Springer, Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg.  Etymology  The spider is named after its discoverer, Ingo Rechenberg, bionics professor at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin. Rechenberg may have first encountered the spider on a trip to Morocco as early as 2006, but it was not until 2008 that he collected the first specimen.Im Gespr√§ch: Ingo Rechenberg √ºber eine neu entdeckte Art Rollende Spinnen f√ºr den Mars. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, p. 7. January 10, 2009. It was initially confused with the Tunisian spider Cebrennus villosus, but later identified as a separate species by Peter J√§ger of the Senckenberg Nature Research Society. After observing small variations in the genitalia of the two species and noticing the distinctive flic-flac motion of the spider, J√§ger confirmed its status as a new species. The holotype is dated 15 July 2009.J√§ger, Peter (April 2014). Cebrennus Simon, 1880 (Araneae: Sparassidae): a revisionary up-date with the description of four new species and an updated identification key for all species. Zootaxa, 3790 (2): 339‚Äì350.  Description  J√§ger describes C. rechenbergi as a medium-sized huntsman spider. Male bodies measure long; female bodies measure long. Males and females are similarly colored white with black scopulae on their ventral legs, and yellow coloring on their dorsal opisthosoma and femora.  Behavior  Cebrennus rechenbergi flic-flacing The Moroccan flic-flac spider is nocturnal and is known to feed on moths before sunrise. It spends the hot desert days in its cool burrow in the sand protected from the sun and predators. The spider creates its dwelling with its pedipalps (feelers) and bristles, forming long, vertical tubes out of sand and silk. Using a series of rapid, acrobatic flic- flac movements of its legs similar to those used by gymnasts, the spider is able to actively propel itself off the ground, allowing it to move both down and uphill, even at a 40 percent incline. This behavior is different than other huntsman spiders, such as Carparachne aureoflava from the Namib Desert, which uses passive cartwheeling as a form of locomotion. The flic-flac spider can reach speeds of up to 2 m/s using forward or back flips to evade threats.  Distribution  Erg Chebbi sand dune habitat C. rechenbergi lives in the sand dunes of the Erg Chebbi desert located in Errachidia Province in southeastern Morocco near the border with Algeria. It is one of 17 species in the genus Cebrennus, typically found in Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.Platnick, Norman I. (2014). Fam. Sparassidae. The World Spider Catalog, Version 14.5. New York, NY, US: American Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 28 July 2014.  Spider robot  Rechenberg's discovery of the flic- flac spider inspired the development of a biomimetic robot based on the rolling spider locomotion. The design process initially involved at least four generations, with the fourth using six legs in three pairs. Rechenberg named the working machine model Tabbot, based on the Berber word \\"tabacha\\", meaning spider. The model, which is approximately 25 cm in length, can both walk in the sand and turn somersaults to move. Rechenberg envisions possible uses for the robot \\"in agriculture, on the ocean floor, or even on Mars\\".Hays, Brooks (6 May 2014). Robot mimics cartwheel movement of desert spider.

Despite the country's tropical weather, the preferred beer styles have remained relatively unchanged, with strong stouts remaining popular. In 2011, Sri Lanka's beer market was estimated to be around 51 million litres per annum, with per capita beer consumption at around 2.7 litres. An increase from 50 million litres and 2.45 litres in 2009. The beer market only represents 39% of the total legitimate alcohol market, the market share however is growing compared to the hard liquor segment. In 2011, the beer industry grew by 23 per cent in volume against 10 per cent growth in the hard liquor segment. Out of the beer consumed in Sri Lanka, 90% is manufactured locally with the remainder imported from Asian markets such as Vietnam, Singapore and India. The local beer market is currently occupied by two main brewers. The largest of Sri Lanka's brewers is the Lion Brewery, which is also the oldest brewery in the country. It produces over 80% of Sri Lanka's beers. In 1988 it constructed a new brewery at Biyagama to replace the century-old facility at Nuwara Eliya. In 1993 the brewery became a subsidiary of Carson Cumberbatch & Co Ltd, and in 1996 the Carlsberg Group acquired a 25% share of the company. The brewery's portfolio includes lagers, strong beers and stouts, notably Lion, Lion Strong and Lion Stout. The company also brews Carlsberg under licence. The brewery exports its beers to the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia and the Maldives. Since 2015, the brewery has produced a number of beers that were previously made by Millers Brewery Ltd, which existed from 1962 to 2015. Sri Lanka's second largest brewer is Heineken Lanka. It started as United Breweries Lanka in 1997, and was later acquired by Asia Pacific Brewery (Lanka) Limited (the former name of Heineken Lanka) in 2005. The brewery's parent company, Heineken Asia Pacific (formerly known as Asia Pacific Breweries), is a Singaporean-based joint venture between Heineken International and Fraser and Neave.

History  A picture of the Black Bridge as it neared completion in 1928, with the 1920 bridge directly beneath it before it was demolished. Before 1907, the only way to cross the river was by boat, a dangerous method which cost many lives. Then, outdoorsman David Rust built a privately-operated cableway. The cableway was a six-foot by ten-foot steel cage large enough for one mule or several people would carry passengers across the river, but the passage was considered precarious.

Black Bridge was designed by Ward Webber and constructed by John Lawrence. The Black Bridge was built in 1928. It would remain the only crossing of the river for hundreds of river miles until the Silver Bridge was built just downstream within the park during the 1960s. As motorized vehicles could not access the construction site, humans and mules transported the 122 tons in materials down the nine miles of trail. Walking single file, 42 Havasupai tribesmen carried the one-ton, 550-foot suspension cables.  Recognition  The bridge was documented in the Historical American Engineering Record in 1984.

Platt, located at Bryant Park in Manhattan, New York, dedicated in 1912. Description and history Frozen fountain in December 2016 The black granite memorial commemorates social worker Josephine Shaw Lowell, who founded the Charity Organization Society. According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Shaw was the first female member of the New York State Board of Charities; the fountain marks the \\"first woman to be honored by a major monument\\" in the city. It is made of Stony Creek granite and bronze. The fountain was dedicated on May 21, 1912, and installed at the east side of Bryant Park in 1913. It was relocated to the west side of the park in 1936. In 2009 the fountain was winterized with the installation of an internal electric heating system, enabling it to be left on in subzero temperatures and gather icicles. The fountain is switched off during extended cold spells to prevent enough ice gathering to cause structural damage.

Harley-Davidson says the maximum speed is with claimed motor. The LiveWire, released in 2019, targets a different type of customer than their classic V-twin powered motorcycles. History The LiveWire was first displayed to the media in June 2014. Prototypes were made available for public test rides at US Harley-Davidson dealerships later in 2014, then Europe and Canada in 2015. The LiveWire was inspired by the \\"Mission R\\" electric superbike, and the powertrains for the prototypes were developed in collaboration with its manufacturer, the electric motorcycle and electric powertrain technology company Mission Motors. As the prototype was unveiled in 2014, the motor was to be mounted longitudinally, under the frame. A bevel gear was planned to change the direction of rotation 90¬∞ to drive a gilmer belt to turn the rear wheel. In the prototypes, the bevel gear gave the drivetrain a unique whirring sound, compared to the sound of a jet turbine, or as a writer for The Verge said, \\"like an oversized vacuum\\". According to Wired magazine in 2014, Mission Motors provided technical assistance on the motor controller. In January 2018, Harley-Davidson announced that the motorcycle was entering production and would hit the market in 18 months. Preorders were planned for January 2019. The first deliveries were made in September 2019 but were temporarily halted due to an unspecified charging issue which Harley- Davidson resolved as of October 2019. In March 2020, Michel von Tell set a world record for distance covered in 24 hours on an electric motorcycle, using the LiveWire. He drove over , beating the previous record of . von Tell started in Zurich, Switzerland, and then traveled to Stuttgart, Germany. After recharging the bike, he drove to Singen, Germany. He repeated the Stuttgart- Singen route six times, before heading to Ruggell, Liechtenstein to end the trip. The trip attracted international attention. In 2020, the streaming video series Long Way Up followed Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman riding LiveWires from South America to North America. Reactions When the electric motorcycle concept was unveiled in 2014, it was called \\"the most radical departure in the 111-year history of the brand\\" by a Fox Sports commentator. Other industry observers see the development of the LiveWire, and the potential development of an electric product or product line, as part of a shift towards \\"people who might not ordinarily be drawn to Harley's traditional loud, heavy, expensive motorcycles\\" and \\"the product of a painful corporate revolution long in the making\\" as Harley-Davidson uses new technology and markets to a wider customer base. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel compared the LiveWire's styling to that of former Harley-Davidson sport bike subsidiary Buell. The Hollywood Reporter noted that an electric Harley-Davidson could become a status symbol like the Tesla Model S, and that the new Harley-Davidson had been placed in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Road & Track posted spy shots from the set in 2014, and reported that Harley-Davidson would gauge the reception by the film's audience as a sort of global market test of the product concept. Powersports Business said that initial customer reactions to test rides in New York in June 2014 were \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" but also noted some negative reactions to the tuning of the regenerative braking system. Jalopnik said the LiveWire, at over $29,000, is \\"far too expensive\\" given the performance, range and charge specifications. TechCrunch writer Jake Bright said the LiveWire pricing ‚Äúwas too damn high‚Äù but gave Harley Davidson props for an EV debut that ‚Äúchecked out as a legitimate e-motorcycle entrant‚Äù while ‚Äúpassing the sniff test‚Äù of the company‚Äôs traditional chrome and steel clientele -- ‚Äúwho aren‚Äôt exactly the Tesla crowd.‚Äù Description Technical specifications include: *LiveWire test on FormulaE track, New York, 2019Motor: , longitudinal design, torque *Power transmission: 90 degree gearbox with belt-driven rear wheel *Cooling system: liquid, shared by motor and controller *Battery: , usable, Samsung cells, with 5-year, unlimited mileage warranty. *Charging: supports Level 3 DC Fast Charging; comes with Level 1 charger that can be stored under the seat. *17-inch front & rear wheels *Single disc, 2-piston front brake *549 lbs in running order *Cast aluminum frame and swingarm *LED headlight *TFT dashboard *Trellis frame *single speed powertrain =Performance= * in 3.0 seconds * +1.9 seconds * Top speed: , electronically-limited * Range: Notes and references =Notes= =References=     * * Further reading * * ‚Äî interview with motorcycle designer Kirk Rasmussen * External links * Category:Electric motorcycles Livewire Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2019 ","title":"Harley-Davidson LiveWire"},{"id":"43101314","text":"The 1962 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was the 3rd conference playoff in league history.

The game began as a senior project in the USC Interactive Media & Games Division and later became an Ouya exclusive after being discovered by Kellee Santiago.  Gameplay  Screenshot of gameplay Thralled is a side-scrolling platform and puzzle game where the player-character is a runaway slave mother escaping the Portuguese slave trade with her baby. The runaway slave, Isaura, escapes from a sugarcane plantation in 18th-century Brazil to find her missing child. She travels through Congo jungles and \\"colonial New World\\", and confronts the pains of losing her child and own past. While pursuing freedom and in fear of being caught and returned, she completes puzzles that include moving carts and cutting rope-bridges while temporarily relinquishing the baby. When the baby is placed down to move objects and cross chasms, a dark apparition version of the main character appears and approaches to take the baby. Settings include the plantation, a slave ship, and a castle that stores slaves for trade. The game has no dialogue, so Isaura expresses herself through movement. The game is played through a sole action button which either comforts the baby or interacts with the environment.  Development  Thralled debuted in mid 2013. It started as a student project by creative director Miguel Oliveira and his peers at the University of Southern California Interactive Media & Games Division‚Äî Oliveira's senior thesis. He and animator Tiffanie Mang continued the project after their graduation and planned an iOS release. When Ouya developer relations head Kellee Santiago saw the game, she approached the developers about a deal: funding in exchange for exclusivity. They agreed, and the agreement funded the new development company. The game was shown at the March 2014 Game Developers Conference's Ouya booth and in the June 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo's IndieCade section. Early feedback said that the game was too difficult, which hurt the level of \\"tension\\" upon trying again. The mother and child element was chosen to \\"universalize\\" the horrors of slavery‚Äîthat the latter could be made easier to understand through the former. The conceit was also a way to not focus on the violence of the era, which Oliveira said he could not accurately or comfortably depict. Thralled is also partially to humanize the tens of millions in modern slavery worldwide. Oliveira has said that he thought the video game medium was young and should be pushed further, as well as that the interactive medium has endless possibilities for self- expression of \\"intimacy\\", for broaching hard topics, and for empathizing with victims. He felt that most games focus on \\"primitive\\", animal feelings‚Äî\\"aggressiveness and competitiveness\\"‚Äîand was interested in empathetic and humanizing games that focus on \\"love and caring\\". The idea of the shadow figure that pursues the unaccompanied baby descends from a Congolese idea of the dead's world as parallel and reverse to ours, as viewable through reflections in bodies of water and mirrors. The developers also integrated their research on period Congolese and Brazilian culture into the game. It is expected for release in 2016. The developers have no plans to release on other platforms and have not said whether the game is a timed exclusive, though Polygon reported that it was one.  Reception  Pre-release reception praised the game's artwork and concept. Polygon Colin Campbell called the game \\"emotionally challenging\\" when citing the baby's cries and Isaura's conspicuous fears. He noted that its gameplay and Ouya exclusivity were likely weak spots. The \\"chilling experience\\" made Kotaku Evan Narcisse cry. He said the game made him consider the lengths to which he would go for his own daughter's betterment. Director of antislavery organization Walk Free Debra Rosen praised the game for its role in raising awareness about modern slavery.

Architect Paul Moratz designed the library building in the Classical Revival style. Litchfield's Women's Club and Chamber of Commerce ran the library for its first few decades and provided funds for improvements such as restrooms. In addition, a children's library program began in 1914 through the assistance of the public school system. The library still serves Litchfield and holds a collection of 34,000 books.

Founded in 1929 by l'Union des ≈ìuvres catholiques de France (The Union of Catholic Works of France; UOCF), the weekly newspaper targeted readers aged 11 to 14 to become part of l'Action catholique des enfants (The Catholic Action for Children; ACE). The newspaper is notable for introducing The Adventures of Tintin to France, as well as Sylvain et Sylvette, the comics of Marijac, and of Cabu. History C≈ìurs Vaillants was founded December 8, 1929 by the conservative Catholic organization l'Union des ≈ìuvres catholiques de France (The Union of Catholic Works of France; UOCF). The founders were Father Gabriel Bard of the Catholic Union of France, Pierre Rougemont (pseudonym of Father Henri Guesdon), and Gaston Courtois, a priest attached to the religious congregation Fils de la charit√© (Son of Charity). Later in 1935, the team was strengthened by the arrival of Father Jean Pihan, ex-John Vaillant, 1912-1996, also of Son of Charity. C≈ìurs Vaillants was a weekly newspaper, targeting readers aged 11 to 14 to become a movement of the church, l'Action catholique des enfants (The Catholic Action for Children; ACE), an organization which continues to this day. The following year, in 1930, The Adventures of Tintin, the series of comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Herg√©, began print syndication with C≈ìurs Vaillants. At first, the editors of C≈ìurs Vaillants were puzzled by the lack of caption text below Herg√©'s comic panels (as was the norm for comics of the day) and added their own text below each panel. Herg√© objected, and even enrolled in an organization that protected author's rights. C≈ìurs Vaillants relented and published further Tintin strips without the captions. The newspaper continued to be the source of The Adventures of Tintin in France for the next seventeen years. C≈ìurs Vaillants began publishing the French cartoonist Marijac in 1931 with his first comic strip Jim Boum, chevalier du Far West (Jim Boum, cowboy of the Far West). C≈ìurs Vaillants was also the first venue for the cartoonist Cabu who won a competition at age 12 and saw his first published drawing appear in the newspaper. By 1936, Herg√© created a new comic series at the request of Abbot Courtois, the editor of C≈ìurs Vaillants, who expressed the desire to see a series about real children with a real family (as opposed to Tintin's ambiguous age and family). The result was Jo, Zette and Jocko. The owners of C≈ìurs Vaillants created a sister publication in 1938; √Çmes vaillantes (Valiant Souls), for girls. From 1940 to 1942, C≈ìurs Vaillants was prohibited in the Zone occup√©e (Occupied Zone); it was replaced by the small periodical Belles Histoires de Vaillance (Beautiful Stories of Valor). The French comics series Sylvain et Sylvette was created by Maurice Cuvillier in 1941 and appeared first on the pages of C≈ìurs Vaillants. Later it was published in a different French magazine, Fripounet et Marisette. In 1963, now published by Editions Fleurus, C≈ìurs Vaillants took the more contemporary name J2 Jeunes (J2 Youth). The \\"J\\" referred to \\"Jeudi\\" (Thursday), the day of publication, which is the day French children did not attend school. In 1971, the magazine was renamed Formula 1.

Thomas House is a historic house located on North Virden Road near Virden, Illinois. The house was built in 1863-65 for agriculturalist Lewis H. Thomas and formed the centerpiece of his farm. Architect Elijah E. Myers, who also designed three state capitol buildings, planned the Victorian house. Thomas extensively used hedge fencing with bois d'arc on his farm and is considered a pioneer of the technique in Illinois. In addition, his farm was known for its livestock and became a local tourist attraction due to its unusual animals, which included peacocks, bears, and deer.

An infant Ganesha is also depicted held in his mother Parvati's lap or over her shoulder.Nagar p. 18 Independent portrayals of Bala Ganapati depict as seated or crawling. A bronze from South India shows Ganesha as an infant crawling on his knees. He has four arms.

Dr. van der Hoeven is a member of the Board of Trustees of the KNCV Tuberculosis Fund.  Education  Dr. van der Hoeven read econometrics at the University of Amsterdam where in 1969 he earned himself a BSc and followed it up with a MSc (Drs.) in 1974. He was awarded a PhD in development economics in 1987 when he defended his thesis Planning for Basic Needs in Kenya: A Basic Needs Simulation Model at the Free University of Amsterdam.  Career  Dr. van der Hoeven has worked for over 30 years in various places in the world for UNICEF and International Labour Organization (ILO), where he was most recently manager of the Technical Secretariat of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization, established by the International Labour Organization in Geneva. Having previously held positions in the Employment Strategy Department of the ILO and with UNICEF in New York, he is widely published on employment, poverty, inequality, and economic reform issues. At the beginning of his career, he worked in Zambia and Ethiopia, highlighted the necessity for developing countries to emphasize the satisfaction of Basic Needs as a prime goal in Development Planning, and advised various countries (Zambia, Swasiland, Tanzania, Niger, Sierra Leone) on how to implement the Basic Needs approach. In the 1980s following the introduction of structural adjustment programs by the World Bank and the IMF, Dr. van der Hoeven researched and advocated that employment and other social concerns should be taken into account in structural adjustment programs. He played a key role in the high-level meeting on structural adjustment and employment of the ILO in 1987 and joined in 1988 the team in UNICEF, under the leadership of Sir Richard Jolly that worked on Adjustment with a Human Face. In the early 1990s he returned to the ILO to manage the Interdepartmental Project on Structural Adjustment in the ILO. Since 2000 he warns of the globalization effects on income inequality and employment, and became in 2002 the manager of the technical secretariat of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization. Dr. van der Hoeven has focused primarily on the functional inequality of income distribution between labor and capital, i.e. the share of gross domestic product received by workers and capital owners. Dr. van der Hoeven appeals to politicians to use the power of macroeconomic policies to reduce inequality. He suggested a number of political solutions including counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policy, stricter financial and bank regulation, progressive tax systems and strengthening social institutions like labor unions. These kinds of policies have led to a notable decline in inequality in Latin America. In light of this, Dr. van der Hoeven called for an inequality goal based on the Palma index of inequality to be included in the post-2015 development agenda (SDGs).

Its facilities include two swimming pools, six badminton courts, ten bowling lanes, eight curling sheets, a skating rink, seven squash courts, six indoor tennis courts, and a fitness facility.  Etymology  The area the club was founded on was called the Glencoe Subdivision. The subdivision was named after the Glencoe valley, in Scotland.  History  The club was founded in 1931 when the Calgary Skating Club decided to handover all assets to the newly formed Glencoe. The official inauguration took place on March 21, 1931. The original directors of the club acquired the land on a 30-year lease from the city of Calgary for $70,000. The original building was contracted to J.A. Tweddle Ltd. and shares were subscribed to at $100 each. The building was constructed in just 3 months and when the Glencoe officially had its grand opening on November 16, 1931 opened it had 1,200 members, 450 of who had shares. Plaque commemorating the founding of the club. During the later part of the thirties and early forties the club was having financial trouble and was essentially bankrupt. However the club made it through these years and following the end of the second world war the board decided to install 'artificial ice' so that skating could be part of the Glencoe year round. When the ice plant opened in 1947 it was the first ice to be used for both curling and skating in Alberta. The Hon. C.E. Gerhart, the then Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Municipal Affairs opened the new plant. The new ice was then used to host the 1948 Canadian Figure Skating Championships. Following this was the 16th annual ice show and the guest star was Barbra Anne Scott along with Wallace Diestelmeyer and Suzanne Morrow. This was so successful that that year there was another ice show in November which featured Yvonne Claire Sherman and Jimmy Grogan. In 1948 the Glencoe grew and improved a further $50,000 in improvements. By now the club hosted: three skating rinks (two outdoor one indoors), six curling rinks, six badminton courts, four bowling alleys, squash courts, two table tennis sets, lawn bowling, six hard surface tennis courts, a lounge, and a dining rooms. In 1953 the Glencoe added four more bowling alleys, two sheets of curling ice as well as renovating the kitchen, lounge, and new offices for $150,000.

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai Ing-wen with her independent running mate Chen Chien-jen won over Eric Chu of the Kuomintang (KMT) and James Soong of the People First Party (PFP). Tsai became the first female president in Taiwan, as well as the Chinese- speaking world. A second-time presidential candidate, Tsai secured the DPP's nomination uncontested as early as February 2015, while KMT candidate Hung Hsiu-chu, who won the party's nomination in July 2015, was trailing behind Tsai by double digits. Alarmed by Hung's perceived pro-Beijing stance, the KMT held an extraordinary party congress to nullify Hung's candidacy in a controversial move, and replaced her by the party chairman Eric Chu, less than a hundred days before the general election. However, Chu did not fare much better than Hung in the polls, and it was almost certain that Tsai was going to win weeks before the election. Veteran politician James Soong also announced his presidential campaign for the fourth time, making the election a three-way contest. Some 12 million voters, 66% of the total registered voters, cast their votes, the lowest turnout since the office was first directly elected in 1996. Alt URL Tsai won 6.89 million votes, leading Chu who received 3.81 million votes by 3.08 million votes, becoming the second highest winning margin behind first direct presidential election in 1996. She also won with 56.1%, the second-largest vote share claimed by a presidential candidate since Ma Ying-jeou in the 2008 election. It was the second time the DPP won the presidency since Chen Shui-bian won in 2000. The DPP also won the Legislative Yuan election on the same day, which secured a DPP majority in the legislature. Legislative election The Legislative Yuan election was held on 16 January 2016 for all 113 seats to the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) led by Tsai Ing-wen, who also won the presidential election on the same day, secured a majority for the first time in history by winning 68 seats. The ruling Kuomintang (KMT), lost both the presidency and the legislature, returned to the opposition. The DPP managed to unseat the KMT in its traditional blue strongholds across Taiwan, turning districts in Taipei, Taichung and Hualien green, while KMT Vice Chairman Hau Lung-bin conceding defeat to relatively unknown city councillor Tsai Shih-ying from the DPP, becoming one of its biggest loses in the election. The year-old New Power Party (NPP) founded by young activists which emerged from the 2014 Sunflower Movement also fared well to win five seats by defeating some of the KMT veterans.

It also contained a chapter on hunting with dogs and chapters on other related subjects such as diseases of birds. There are about 27 Latin manuscript versions of Moamyn's work with two of them being illustrated throughout, with a well-known copy held in Vienna. Identity The true identity of Moamyn is a mystery. The name by which he was known in the medieval west is most likely the result of a corruption or simplification of the true pronunciation of the Arabic name. Based on this, among other reasons, Fran√ßois Vir√© has suggested that he is in fact Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809‚Äì873), physician of the Abbasid Caliphate. Thus, Moamyn would be the deformation of the original Arabic Hunayn. However, there are other theories. Origins The KitƒÅb al-mutawakkilƒ´ of the mid ninth century was thought to be Moamyn's treatise on falconry in the original Arabic, but was discovered not to be in the 1980s. It was translated into Castilian in 1252 under the title Libro de los animales que ca√ßan. Moamyn's work is largely based on the KitƒÅb al-·π≠uy≈´r (ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ∑ŸäŸàÿ±), the Book of Birds (also known as the KitƒÅb dawari at-tayr, the Book of flight cycles(patterns) of Birds), a more extensive work by al-Ghi·π≠rƒ´f ibn QudƒÅmah al-GhassƒÅnƒ´ from the early ninth century.

It occupies a prominent place along Superior Street, and underwent a massive renovation effort by the City of Duluth. The NorShor played a significant role in the artistic history of Duluth, and is generally considered a landmark. History The history of the site traces its beginnings back to the Grand Opera House, which was built at the location in 1883. The 1,000 seat Opera House also housed a library, and was home to the local Kitchi Gammi Club. Unfortunately, the opera house was destroyed by a fire in 1889. The modern-day NorShor traces its history back to 1910, when it began as the Orpheum Theatre, located on the former site of the Grand Opera House. It was a Classical Revival-style theatre, and was a premier venue for Vaudeville performances in Duluth. In addition to Vaudeville acts and other performances, the Orpheum was one of Duluth's earliest movie theatres. During the age of silent films, many movie theatres were equipped with a theatre organ, to accompany the silent films with music and sound effects. In 1925, an ornate looking organ made by the Geneva Organ Company was installed in the auditorium. The organ had 2 manuals and 8 ranks of pipes. But by the 1940s, the Silent Film era, as well as the Vaudeville era were over, and the Orpheum needed to be reinvented to stay in business and remain relevant. It was renamed the NorShor, and was remodeled in a fabulous Art Deco style. The new NorShor featured a 125-foot tall exterior tower made of porcelain. The tower contained 3,000 lights, making it visible for a long distance, as a notable feature of Duluth's skyline. The tower was subsequently removed in later years, and plans to replace it were scrapped during the renovations. By the mid 2000s, the building had lost most of its former glory. As the condition of the building was deteriorating, the theatre's local reputation was also in decline. While being operated as a Strip club, along with reports of other unsavory activities taking place at the NorShor, the once-fine theatre was now devoid of its former luxury. But luckily a new chapter would unfold, when the property was acquired by the city. 2010 acquisition and redevelopment by the city In June 2010, the Duluth Economic Development Authority purchased the NorShor, along with the adjacent Temple Opera buildings for a combined total of $2.6 million. Although the city has sometimes been criticized for this move, the decision has been defended by Duluth's Mayor (at the time), Don Ness, who cited an improvement in the building's neighborhood, with the elimination of the strip club. Ness has said the NorShor was \\"key to the revitalization of the entire downtown district.\\" In 2014, the city landed $6.95 million from a state bonding bill from the Minnesota Legislature, for use in renovating the NorShor. Although this was only a part of the $22.3 million needed for the complete overall renovation, it was a critical first step that would help ensure future funding sources come through. In a June 8, 2014 article in the Duluth News Tribune, Ness was quoted as saying, \\"If we hadn't taken ownership of the building ... we would have continued to have a strip club there with gang activity and prostitution and drug dealing. And that's in a prominent place on Superior Street. It would have been a continual black eye on that part of downtown. And the building would have eventually fallen apart.\\" In addition to the bonding funds, other fundraising efforts were ongoing. And helping to ensure the successful future of the NorShore, the city identified the Duluth Playhouse as the facility's manager and operator, once the reconstruction would be complete. And developer George Sherman was named as the developer for the restoration project. The NorShor today After 19 months of construction and renovations, the Norshor finally opened on February 1, 2018. The first performance was Mamma Mia!. The new NorShor, with a 600-seat, stadium-style, balconied, live-performance auditorium, is expected to generate an estimated $5 million to $6 million of annual economic benefit. Restorations included an extension of the stage, making the building handicap accessible, and adding modern state-of-the-art theatre equipment. A new bar and lounge are also new features. Being managed by the Duluth Playhouse, the NorShor is now a major presenter of arts and entertainment in the Twin Ports region.

The son of a prosperous and influential Scottish gentry family, he became a trader in India. Having made a fortune supplying the Royal Navy, he returned to Scotland to buy several landed estates, including Whittingehame in East Lothian where he built a classical mansion. Balfour became a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) from 1826 to 1834, but never achieved ministerial office. However, many of his descendants found fame and success, including his grandson Arthur Balfour, who served as prime minister from 1902 to 1905. At his death, Balfour's estates in Scotland alone were estimated to be worth over ¬£1 million (equivalent to ¬£ in ).  Family and early life  Balbirnie House in Fife, Balfour's birthplace Balfour was born about 1775. He was the second son of John Balfour (1739‚Äì1813), an advocate who owned Balbirnie House, near the town of Glenrothes in Fife. His elder brother Robert Balfour, who inherited Balbirnie, became a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. His ancestor George Balfour had purchased Balbirnie in the late 16th or early 17th century, and by the late 18th century its land included profitable mines in the Fife Coalfield.  Career  = India = After studying book-keeping and accountancy in Edinburgh, Balfour went to Madras in March 1795 as a writer (junior clerk) for the British East India Company. He held several posts in the following years, before being sent back to Britain after a disciplinary issue. Balfour returned to India in 1802, where he became a merchant in partnership with James Baker. His breakthrough came in 1806, when the partners obtained the contract with the Victualling Commissioners of the Royal Navy to supply their needs throughout the East Indies. The contract had been held since 1796 by the Hon. Basil Cochrane, who had built his own flour mills and bakeries in Madras. Cochrane returned to England in 1806 due to ill-health, and had intended to appoint Balfour and Baker as his agents. However, before leaving, Cochrane was notified that the Navy was reviewing his accounts dating back to 1794, and that the Navy had lost much of the paperwork. He then returned to England permanently to settle the accounts, which took until 1820. Instead of engaging agents, Cochrane passed the contract to Balfour and Baker, who held it until at least 1815. At some point the partnership was dissolved, and the contract held by Balfour alone. When he left India, he had accumulated a fortune of ¬£300,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The Indian business did not end with Balfour's return home. It was run on his behalf by agents, and within a few decades the family's assets had grown ten-fold to ¬£3 million (equivalent to ¬£ in ). = Scotland = Whittingehame estate, possibly also designed by Robert Smirke On his return to Scotland in 1815, Balfour married Lady Eleanor Maitland (1790‚Äì1869), daughter of the Tory politician James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale. They had seven children, three of whom predeceased their parents. The eldest son was killed by a fire in 1822. Within two years of their marriage, Balfour had bought two large county estates. The first was a sporting estate with shooting lodge in the Highlands, at Strathconan in Ross-shire. In 1817, he purchased the Whittingehame estate in Haddingtonshire from Colonel William Hay of Duns Castle, which provided a net rental income of ¬£11,000 per year (equivalent to ¬£,000 in ). He also bought a town house in London, No. 3 Grosvenor Square. In the 1820s the Balfours employed the architect Robert Smirke, designer of the British Museum, to build a large classical mansion at Whittingehame, along with a stable block and gate lodges. They equipped their home with French furniture and S√®vres china. Built of pale cullalo stone, the house was expanded and altered in 1827 to the designs of William Burn, which were not entirely successful. Colin McWilliam and Christopher Wilson describe them as having changed \\"a dry composition into a boring one\\". They then rebuilt the local church, and created a new model village to the north-west of the old one. Built in about 1840 of red sandstone, it consists of a row of cottages and a school. Established as a country gentleman, though known locally as \\"the nabob\\", Balfour became a justice of the peace, and in 1822 was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire. Strathconon (or Strathconan) House, Balfour's hunting lodge in the Scottish Highlands In about 1823 or 1824 he paid ¬£104,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to buy from the 10th Earl of Leven a large estate in his native Fife, including Balgonie Castle. Adjacent to his native Balbirnie, the Balgonie estate included coal mines which worked seams described as \\"inexhaustible\\" and iron workings. = Parliament = In November 1820, the death of Henry St Paul MP triggered a by-election for the borough of Berwick- upon-Tweed, where Balfour's father-in-law Lord Lauderdale had great influence. Balfour was also supported by Admiral Sir David Milne, who had defeated St Paul at the general election in March 1820 but was unseated on petition in July. However, Lauderdale was disliked for his opposition to the popular Queen Caroline, which became a significant issue in the campaign. His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as too close to Liverpool's Tory ministry to properly represent interests of the borough. After four days of polling, Balfour lost by 9 votes (374‚Äî363) to the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake. Balgonie Castle in Glenrothes, Fife, in Balfour's Fife estate A further vacancy occurred in Berwick in 1822, but Balfour did not contest the seat. Instead, he turned his attentions to the Anstruther Burghs, a set of five burghs which were located only 15 miles from his newly purchased estate at Balgonie in Fife. At the 1826 general election he won the support of three burghs of Pittenweem, Anstruther Easter and Crail, whereas the sitting MP and Lord Advocate of Scotland Sir William Rae won only Anstruther Wester and Kilrenny. With three out of five votes Balfour was declared elected, and a petition lodged by Rae was rejected in March 1827. In 1829, several groups of his constituents submitted petitions against the Roman Catholic Relief Bill. Balfour presented all the petitions to Parliament, but in April he voted with the majority in favour of the Bill. Balfour was opposed at the 1830 general election by Robert Marsham, the Warden of Merton College, Oxford. However, he won the seat, taking three of the four boroughs remaining after Kilrenny's disenfranchisement in 1829. At the 1831 general election, Balfour was drafted to stand instead in the county seat of Haddingtonshire, the area which included Whittingehame. The sitting MP Lord John Hay had been an advocate of Parliamentary reform, a view which was supported by the county's voteless tenant farmers but opposed by the existing voters. Lord John's position looked untenable, so Balfour was drafted by Lord Lauderdale and Hay's brother Lord Tweeddale. Describing himself as an opponent of the current reform proposals, but a supporter of a \\"wise and prudent amendment to the representative system\\", he won the seat by a margin of 40 votes to the 11 of his opponent Sir David Baird, Bt. However, a crowd of non- voting residents of Haddington shouted down his attempts to make a speech of thanks. The new Parliament was dominated by the Reform Bills, and in the last Parliament of the Unreformed House of Commons Balfour voted against them at most opportunities. At the general election in December 1832, with the franchise expanded under the Scottish Reform Act, Balfour was re-elected but with a much narrower majority of 271 votes to 232. His health had been declining, and he cited that as his reason for retiring at the dissolution of Parliament in December 1834. At the general election in January 1835, the Haddingtonshire seat was won by the Whig Robert Ferguson.  Death and legacy  The Balfour Monument, near Whittingehame, erected in memory of Balfour's son James Maitland Balfour Balfour died at Whittingehame in April 1845, aged about 70. He was survived by his wife, Lady Eleanor, two sons, and two daughters. Another two daughters and a son predeceased him. The surviving children were: * James Maitland Balfour (1820‚Äì1856), MP for Haddington Burghs 1841‚Äì47, father of five sons and three daughters * Charles Balfour (1823‚Äì1872), who married Adelaide Barrington, daughter and 8th child of the 6th Viscount Barrington. * Mary Balfour (1817‚Äì1893), a noted watercolour artist who married Henry Arthur Herbert, owner of the Muckross estate in County Kerry, and Chief Secretary for Ireland 1857‚Äì58 * Anna Balfour (1825‚Äì1857), who married Lord Augustus Fitzroy, later 7th Duke of Grafton On his death, Balfour's estate was valued at over ¬£1 million. His widow Eleanor (who survived him by 24 years) was left a legacy of ¬£31,000 and a life annuity of ¬£3,760. The rest was divided between his children. The estates at Whittingehame and Strathconan were left to his eldest son, along with a house in Grosvenor Square, London. His property in Fife, including Balgonie Castle, was left to his second son Charles, while his daughters Mary and Anna had each been given a dowry of ¬£40,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Whittingehame Tower, which is still owned by descendants of James Balfour Until the Reform Act in 1832, political power in Britain had been dominated for centuries by a land- owning oligarchy, and for another century they shared power with the rising bourgeoisie. The Balfour family straddled both groups. James Balfour's new wealth brought new vigour to the ancient family, with many of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren achieving notability. They include: *James Maitland Balfour's children: **Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1905 ** Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick (1845‚Äì1936), Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge ** Alice Blanche Balfour (1850‚Äì1936), amateur entomologist **Francis Maitland Balfour (1851‚Äì1882), one of the greatest biologists of his day ** Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour (1853‚Äì1945), a cabinet minister from 1895 to 1905. His daughter Lady Eve Balfour (1899‚Äì1990) was an early advocate of organic farming, and co-founder of the Soil Association ** Colonel Eustace James Anthony Balfour (1854‚Äì1911), an architect who served as ADC to King Edward VII. * Charles Balfour's son Charles Barrington Balfour became an army officer and an MP. One of his sons was knighted for his work as a diplomat * Mary's son Henry Arthur Herbert, was MP for Kerry from 1866 to 1880 * Two of Anna's sons became Dukes of Grafton As with many other estate houses in Scotland, Balfour family ownership of Whittingehame House ended in the 20th century. Arthur and Gerald lost a lot of money in a series of poor investments, particularly in their efforts to develop peat processing as a green alternative to coal-mining. In the 1930s, death duties forced the mothballing of the house and sale of its contents. The building was leased for various purposes before being sold in 1963 to become a residential school, and has since been converted into apartments. The older Whittingehame Tower has been restored and remains the residence of the Earls of Balfour, descendants of James Balfour.

It is recognized by the National Museum as a National Cultural Treasure (Level 1).  History  Majayjay served as the site of early Catholicism in Laguna. The Augustinians first came in 1568. Along with five Augustinian priests and Juan de Salcedo, nephew of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, they started to evangelize the sceptical townsmen led by Gat Yantok. In 1571, the Franciscans established a mission town with Don Gaspar Osorio, Agust√≠n Osorio, Juan Osorio, Juan de Mendoza, Ventura Mag-olop, Aman Lingasan and Mart√≠n Siasip. The first church was constructed by locals in 1575 near the May-it river and was made of nipa and bamboo and was later burned in 1576. In 1578, Franciscans Fathers Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa started to evangelize the town. A church, still of nipa and bamboo, was built that same year under the patronage of Saint Gregory the Great. Due to the lack of religious men, the first parish priest of Majajay, Father Antonio Nombela was only assigned in 1594. Under his pastorship, a long robe worn by wives to the church, called lamb√≥n was first used in the Philippines. In 1599, the Superior Gobierno authorized the construction of a stone church. While awaiting its construction, the makeshift church was burned in 1606. Majayjay also served as infirmary for the old religious men until 1606 before it was transferred to Lumban. Construction of the stone church began in 1616 and was completed in 1649 with the help of Maestro de Campo Don Buenaventura de Mendoza. The church was again partially burned in 1660. Rehabilitation started in 1711 and finished in 1730 by 14,000 people on forced labor and a rehabilitation cost of $26,000 by Father Jose de Puertollano. Instead of rebuilding the church, Father Puertollano decided to sandwich the ruins between two layers of brick resulting in an unusual wall thickness of . It took 19 years for the people of Majayjay to complete the church which was made of adobe stone with red tiles and prime lumber. On completion in 1730, the church became the biggest in the Philippines A century later, the stone church was destroyed by typhoon and was repaired in 1839, 1842 and 1848. The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1892 under the supervision of Father Gregorio Platero. During the American occupation, the church served as headquarters of the American army. Due to damage brought about by the Spanish and American revolution, the church was again repaired in 1912. In 1954, the church was placed under the government's rehabilitation program with the help of the National Conservation Society of the Philippines. In 2001, it was declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum.  Features  The Romanesque church of Majayjay is long, wide and meters high. Its fa√ßade has three levels, each level scaled proportionally and topped by a triangular pediment with a circular window. The central nave consists of a huge wooden door of the main portal, choir loft windows and saint's niche. The interior contains a retablo mayor and four other minor retablos with intricate designs. The floor is tiled with azulejo and the walls have been preserved with some alterations. The five-storey square belltower with a conical roof and ballustrated windows on each polygonal level is connected to the langit-langitan, a cat-walk above the ceiling which leads to the crossing over the transept. The belfry has arched windows each with a bell trimmed with finials and a large antique bell on top. It also has a large side door on the right side of the church. Today, the church contains antique images of santos, reliquaries and century-old liturgical objects. = Convent = The huge convent (also convento) of the church, which provides a good view of Laguna de bay, is one of the best preserved convento in the country and is the earliest surviving example of its kind. It houses a small museum of old parish documents and ecclesiastical silver. A small portion of the church was converted into the present-day Liceo de Majayjay, a Catholic school under the supervision of the local parish and the Diocesan Catholic School System of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pablo.  Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Porteria  Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Porteria, also known as Ermita The chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Porteria (Our Lady of the Gate) also known as the Ermita chapel was originally constructed as a tribunal during the Spanish period. The image of the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Porteria, which was brought to Majayjay by Spanish missionaries in 1759, was enshrined in the former court building in 1760.

Early life  Torstein Dale Sj√∏tveit was born in Miland, a small village 12 km outside the small industrial town of Rjukan, in Norway. His interest in industrial development can be attributed to the transformative impact of hydropower upon his hometown of Rjukan, turning it from a remote rural area located in a narrow valley just under Gaustatoppen ‚Äì one of Norway's highest mountains ‚Äì to an important industrial town and a famous Norwegian tourist destination. Torstein attended the Finance and Administration College at Rjukan from 1972-73.

Sarawak Energy is being guided by the IHA Sustainability Protocol in implementing the hydropower development projects. Sarawak Energy also hosted the World Congress for Advancing Sustainable Hydropower in Kuching in May 2013. Torstein has fostered a company direction where CSR initiatives are placed at centre stage, focusing on the capacity of hydropower to secure socio-economic development for the remote communities of Sarawak. The ongoing Penan literacy programme provides basic reading, writing and numeracy skills for close to 500 people in the six Penan indigenous communities in Murum. With support from rural communities, besides literacy and numeracy, the programme has focused on new ways of thinking to improve living conditions, including health, hygiene, nutrition and gardening. The program endeavours to help the communities make the most of new opportunities arising through the community's resettlement programme. Besides learning new skills, the program has been successful in providing key motivation to the community, with a strong focus on the importance of education. Its support is reflected by the enrollment of 280 students at the two new primary schools, SK Metalun and SK Tegulang in 2014.

The estate dates from 1571, but today's house was built in 1788. Since 1959, the estate has been used by Aarhus University for teaching and research. Today it is the university's conference centre. History Sandbjerg is mentioned for the first time around 1500. In 1564, King Frederick II transferred a third of his properties, including Sandbjerg, to his brother John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg. It remained in the hands of the House of Sonderburg until Christian Adolf's bankruptcy in 1667, when it was returned to the Crown. In 1668 it was sold to the statesman Conrad Reventlow, who established the fiefdom of Reventlow-Sandbjerg. In 1788, Conrad Georg Reventlow (1749‚Äì1815) commissioned Christian August Bohlsmann to build a mansion overlooking the Alssund on the east side of M√∏lle S√∏. The park and the tenancy buildings and the mansion now form the Sandbjerg Estate. After retiring from the navy in 1795, Reventlow spent extended periods at Sandbjerg where he enjoyed good food and drink prepared by his French chef, Charles Maton. Among his guests were the poets Jens Baggesen and Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. In the 1850s, General Frederk B√ºlow who was victorious at the Battle of Fredericia in 1849, spent several summers on the estate, where he died in 1858. The last of the Reventlows died in 1929. In 1930 the estate was sold to Knud Dahl, a lawyer, and his wife Ellen, Karen Blixen's sister. After her husband died 1945, Ellen Dahl opened the residence to cultural and scientific figures and, in 1954, gave it to Aarhus University. On her death in 1959, the university took full possession of the estate. Mansion The two-storey Rococo mansion completed in 1788 is a listed building. With a lesene-decorated facade and tall hipped roof, its rooms include a library, dining room and conservatory and three historic bedrooms.

History Founded in 1969 by the Catholic order Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood as Assisi Home for the poor and sick, and was reconstituted as Assisi Hospice in 2007. It is owned and run by the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood. The Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood (FMDM) Sisters have a long tradition of providing healthcare. In 1949, the local government invited a small group of FMDM Sisters for a nursing post in the Tuberculosis Section of Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore. The Sisters were also nursing leprosy patients at the Trafalgar Home and staffing the School of Nursing there. Anticipating their services would no longer be needed after Singapore's recovery from the Japanese Occupation, the Sisters saved their hard earned salaries to build up a fund for the eventual building of a private Catholic hospital. These 10 years savings were augmented by generous donations from both companies and individuals. On 4 March 1961, Mount Alvernia Hospital was officially opened. In 1969, donations from the late Mr Khoo Teck Puat saw the building of an extension of Mount Alvernia Hospital. The beds in this block are for chronically ill patients. In 1986, the Khoo block started accepting respite patients. The building eventually became known as Assisi Home. Assisi Home derived its name from the birthplace of Saint Francis, the Founder of the Franciscan Movement. In March 1988, the Congregation of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood expanded into the area of Hospice Care. Hence Assisi began to admit only cancer patients requiring respite and hospice care. In 1992, the Sisters vacated their convent and refurbished it into a new hospice. Assisi Home & Hospice was officially opened on April 1993 by the then President of Singapore, the late Mr Wee Kim Wee. In 1993, Assisi discontinued the admission of patients for long-term care and focused on hospice care for the terminally ill cancer patients. Assisi Home & Hospice was changed to Assisi Hospice as a statement of our steadfast commitment to this mission. A centre for compassionate and personalised palliative care, Assisi Hospice has also admitted patients with non-cancer diagnoses as it recognise the significant suffering even among those with other life limiting illnesses.

In 2012 and 2013, he played for the Bulldogs' NYC team. On 20 April 2013, he played for the Queensland under-20s team against the New South Wales under-20s team.

In Round 15 of the 2014 NRL season, he made his NRL debut for the Bulldogs against the Canberra Raiders, playing off the interchange bench in the Bulldogs' 22-14 win at Canberra Stadium. In Round 23 against the Parramatta Eels, he suffered a season ending ankle injury in the Bulldogs' 18-16 win at ANZ Stadium. He finished off his debut year in the NRL, having played in 8 matches for the Bulldogs. On 1 December, he re-signed with the Bulldogs on a 4-year contract. =2015= On 31 January and 1 February, Perrett played for the Bulldogs in the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines. He finished off the 2015 season having played in 14 games for the Bulldogs. =2016= On 12 January, Perrett was selected in the QAS Emerging Maroons squad. In September, he was named on the interchange bench in the 2016 Intrust Super Premiership NSW Team of the Year. On 9 December, he signed a 3-year contract with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles starting in 2017, after being released from the final 2 years of his Bulldogs contract. =2017= Perrett was named in the Sea Eagles squad for the 2017 NRL Auckland Nines.

Perrett was unable to complete the majority of the 2018 pre-season. He managed to play 13 games in the 2018 season, averaging a light 18 minutes per game. He was also the only Manly player happy to see the exit of Coach Trent Barrett, as it appeared Perrett was not accustomed to Barrett's coaching style. = 2019 = Alike the previous season, Perrett has spent most of his 2019 pre-season on the bench due to lack of fitness with completing Hasler's training regimes. Perrett will be off-contract beyond 2019. Unfortunately, Perrett's playing career at Manly appears slim, as he took part in playing both his trial games alongside reserve grade players.

Perrett featured in both of Manly's finals matches after the club finished in 6th place at the end of the regular season. Perrett started both games from the bench as Manly reached the second week of the finals series before they were eliminated by South Sydney 34-26 at ANZ Stadium. In November 2019, it was announced that Perrett had been released by Manly-Warringah. On 26 November, it was revealed that Perrett was on a train and trial contract with the Brisbane Broncos.

Bladen shared his role there with Charles Delafaye. In 1715 he was made a Privy Councillor in Ireland. In 1717 he was offered an appointment as Envoy Extraordinary to Spain to replace Mr Brett but declined it.

Bladen was convinced that Britain‚Äôs power and ability to trade favourably with other countries was greatly enhanced by the income from her colonies and, for economic reasons, it was vital for the colonies to serve the mother country and the appearance of a unified Britain with her colonies would deter other European colonial powers from attempting encroachment. A final report on British Colonies in America was produced in 1739 \\"Reasons for Appointing a Captain General for the Continent of North America\\" which was more conciliatory in tone than previous ones where preservation of trade with the American colonies was considered more important than their 'subjection'.Cholmondeley (Houghton) Papers Ch(H) P84/38, Cambridge University, Department of Manuscripts and University Archives Bladen‚Äôs influence at the Board of Trade continued to grow through the 1730s and he attended a Conference at AntwerpJournal of the Board of Trade vol 6, pp294-8BPRO to negotiate on tariffs.

Marriage and children Martin married Mary Gibbs c1699.

Tinker and Isabella had two sons. Martin was brother-in- law to Nathaniel Rice who was Secretary of the Royal Council of North Carolina and Acting Governor on two occasions. After Mary's death in 1724 Martin married in 1727/8 to Frances Foche/Jory, heiress of Colonel Joseph Jory, Agent for Nevis, and owner of a plantation and several properties. Frances inherited Aldborough Hatch in Barking in Essex upon which Bladen built a new house where the couple lived. Frances had several children from her previous marriage to John Foche but all died within her lifetime. In later life, Martin was a Justice of the Peace and was largely responsible for driving highwayman Dick Turpin of the Gregory Gang out of Barking in Essex.Bert Lockwood, late President of Ilford Historical Society Martin's town residence was a Georgian building at the south end of Hanover Square. He also owned the Barmoor Estate in Northumberland and leased the Prebendary Manor of Ketton in Rutland.

In the 1800s, the locality was alternately known as Shankhill. In the 2016 census, Gnarwarre had a population of 267 people. History The area was first settled by squatters in the late 1830s. The Gnarwarre Parish was first advertised for sale in 1839, with the parish, consisting of 22 lots of 640 acres or bigger, put up for sale on 10 June 1840. The sale was dramatically less successful than the February sale of blocks in the Barrabool Parish, with only four blocks being sold; virtually all of the remainder would be eventually sold in the 1850s. The Gnarwarre Parish did not see the same significant subdivision that occurred in the nearby Modewarre and Duneed parishes, which Wynd attributes to the land being seen as more suitable for grazing. The population in the Gnarwarre area, as opposed to areas further east, was largely Catholic. A Catholic school was established at Gnarwarre in 1853, and was used as a church on Sundays. A more permanent school building was slowly constructed over several years, and finally opened on 2 February 1862; Wynd suggests that poverty on the part of the local population had meant that further work was only done when funds became available. An Anglican school also opened at Gnarwarre in November 1856, and a Primitive Methodist church opened around 1865. The Catholic school became a common school, then in 1872 the first Gnarwarre State School, but was closed down at the end of 1874 as it was to be replaced by a new school on a new two-acre site. The Shankhill Hotel was opened by James Murphy in 1856, but was burned down in 1864 and not rebuilt. The Gnarwarre Hotel was opened by Patrick Corbett in 1864 on a site \\"a little distance west\\" of the former hotel. A post office opened on 1 October 1857. In addition to the hotel, in 1861, Gnarwarre had a butcher, a blacksmith, and store. The former Catholic church and school ceased being used for services from around 1900, was used as a dance hall during World War I, and was demolished in 1959. The Gnarwarre Hotel closed in 1922 and was demolished in 1968. Gnarwarre Post Office closed on 30 June 1963. Gnarwarre State School would outlive the remainder of the village, but closed and opened numerous times with changing student numbers. The school, having opened on a new site from the old Catholic school at the start of 1875, closed in 1879-80, reopened in 1881, closed again from 1950 to 1956, and was re-opened again in 1957. It was replaced by a new school in the 1960s, but closed permanently in 1991 because of falling student numbers. Wynd, writing in 1992, states that some of Gnarwarre's buildings survived until the 1960s, but that a motorist would see \\"absolutely nothing to recall the existence of Shankhill/Gnarwarre.\\" There were also three unsuccessful attempts at founding other settlements within the modern Gnarwarre locality: Lanark, Barwon, and Pollocksford. Lanark was advertised as being at the junction of what is now Mount Pollock Road at Gnarwarre; a street pattern was laid out, and a land auction took place on 23 January 1854. Wynd notes that there is \\"no record of who bought land, and no evidence that any settlement ever developed there\\". Barwon was auctioned on 9 March 1854, advertised as being \\"on the Ballarat Road\\". It was described in the Geelong Advertiser in 1874 as being \\"a sort of no man's land where anybody and everybody runs their stock\\" and had disappeared by the 1880s. Pollocksford, straddling the Barwon River in modern Gnarwarre and Murgheboluc, was marked for a settlement, and an Anglican school was proposed there in the 1860s, but was never built. Gnarwarre today The Gnarwarre Public Hall and a Country Fire Authority station are located at Gnarwarre. Gnarwarre is a base for two major horseracing studs. Tony Santic, the owner of Melbourne Cup- winning horse Makybe Diva, bases his breeding and training outfit, Makybe Racing and Breeding, at Gnarwarre. A second operator, Rosemont Stud, also operates in Gnarwarre, and bought 44% of the Makybe farm in 2012. The locality is also home to a major wool-growing property, Roxby Park. Graeme Lloyd, the first Australian to play in a winning World Series baseball team, was raised in Gnarwarre.

Similar hijacking can occur with academic conferences as well. Background In 2012, cyber criminals began hijacking print-only journals by registering a domain name and creating a fake website under the title of the legitimate journals. The first journal to be hijacked was the Swiss journal Archives des Sciences. In 2012 and 2013, more than 20 academic journals were hijacked. In some cases, scammers find their victims in conference proceedings, extracting authors' emails from papers and sending them fake calls for papers.

He was the first Orthodox bishop of Athens to be allowed to reside in the city since its conquest by the Crusaders in 1205 and the exile of its then bishop, Michael Choniates. Holders of the see continued to be appointed in the meanwhile, but were always in exile, while Athens, like most of the principalities of Frankish Greece, remained the sole province of the new Roman Catholic clergy. The situation changed in 1388, when the Duchy of Athens passed into the hands of the Florentine Acciaioli family. With little military might of their own, and surrounded by potential rivals and enemies, the Acciaioli cultivated a policy of conciliation towards the overwhelmingly Orthodox local Greek population. To that end, they adopted Greek as the official language of their chancery, and allowed an Orthodox metropolitan to resume residence in their capital, even though the Church of the Virgin in the Parthenon remained the residence of the Latin Archbishop of Athens, and Dorotheus had to do with a church in the lower city. Dorotheus was also proedros, i.e. administrator, of the vacant sees of Thebes and Neopatras, which were also located within the duchy. Dorotheus was expelled from his see in 1392 by Duke Nerio I Acciaioli, who accused him of treacherous dealings with the Ottoman Turks, because, in the spirit of his ardent hostility to the Latin Church, he had welcomed the raids of the Ottoman commander Evrenos Beg against the Frankish states of southern Greece in 1391‚Äì92. Although a synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople absolved Dorotheus of any blame‚Äîwith the justification that the arguments of Nerio were inadmissible since he was a Catholic‚ÄîNerio refused to allow his return.

Sung by the Beast after he frightens Belle away from the castle, \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" details the character's struggles to love her. The song was first performed by American actor Terrence Mann, who both originated the role of the Beast on Broadway and recorded it for the show's original cast album. Since the Beast barely sings in the original film, Menken and Rice wrote \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" to give the Beast a proper solo number, as well as offer him character development and an opportunity to express his feelings about both Belle and his situation. A melancholy power ballad more operatic in style than the show's other songs, \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" is a lament about love both desired and lost. The song is later reprised after the Beast frees Belle and allows her to return home. Upon premiering in Beauty and the Beast, \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" received mostly positive reviews from theatre critics, who praised Menken and Rice's songwriting, and Mann's vocal performance. \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" has since been covered by several artists, including singer Josh Groban. \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" was nearly included in the 2017 live-action remake of the film but was ultimately omitted because the songwriters deemed the ballad unsuitable for the film's pacing, instead replacing it with an original song for the Beast entitled \\"Evermore\\". Background In Beauty and the Beast (1991), the Beast does not have his own song and hardly sings apart from a brief solo during \\"Something There\\". Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman had not been able to determine a suitable moment for the character to sing in the original film, but Menken considered it imperative that the Beast sing in the 1994 stage musical adaptation because he believes that he is truly \\"the protagonist of the story, whose life has changed in the most dramatic way.\\" \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" was one of six original songs written by Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the stage adaptation. Since Ashman had died in 1991 prior to the film's release, Rice was recruited to collaborate with Menken on writing new songs for the stage musical, out of which \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" was developed. Menken identified creating \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" as \\"one of the benefits\\" of his new partnership with Rice. \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" was written to close the show's first act. Since the musical was written in two-act structure, \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" was conceived to allow the Beast an important opportunity to either \\"howl for redemption or just say I‚Äôve given up\\". \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" focuses on character development, as do most original songs written specifically for the musical. Determining that the production did not require more show-stopping musical numbers like \\"Be Our Guest\\" and \\"Gaston\\", Rice opted to write new material that \\"expand[s] the characters and their relationships\\" instead, describing \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" as a song that uncovers the Beast's \\"human longings\\". Linda Woolverton, who wrote the film's screenplay, also used \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" to develop the Beast into a more rounded, fully realized character while adapting her own screenplay into the show's book, further exploring \\"thoughts previously unheard\\" from the character. Actor Terrence Mann, who originated the role of the Beast on Broadway, recorded \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" for the musical's original cast album, which was released on April 26, 1994. Use in Beauty and the Beast \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" is sometimes referred to by critics as the Beast's only solo song in the stage musical, although the character also performs the brief \\"How Long Must this Go On?\\". Prior to \\"If I Can't Love Her\\", the show primarily consists of upbeat musical numbers performed by supporting characters such as Gaston, Lefou, and Lumiere. In the musical, the Beast sings \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" at the end of Beauty and the Beast's first act after he angrily frightens Belle away from the castle, before she encounters a pack of wolves while fleeing through the forest, serving as the finale to Act I. Immediately following the lively \\"Be Our Guest\\", the ballad precedes the show's intermission, ending Act I \\"on a smoky and introspective note\\", according to Brad Hevenor of The Independent. Belle leaves the Beast to ponder what little is left of his humanity. While lamenting the status of his relationship with Belle, the Beast realizes that he has squandered an opportunity to love someone and \\"turn everything around,\\" still struggling to love a person as \\"beautiful and fascinating\\" as Belle. Belle's departure forces the Beast to examine that failing to love her will result in him remaining a beast forever, realizing that he has not only lost Belle but also \\"any chance of being himself again.\\" Striving to imbue the character with more depth and dimension, Menken described the scene as a moment in which the Beast ponders \\"If I can‚Äôt love her then who can I ever love?\\". The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak described the song as a \\"soul-searching\\" ballad in which the hero \\"fights off despair and considers his ability to fall in love with Belle\\". According to Tamara Ikenberg of the Anchorage Daily News, the number \\"reveals the depths of the Beast's depression as he accepts that he may never be human again and wishes for a way ... out of his pain.\\" Natalie Salvo of The AU Review identified the musical number as the moment \\"the character poured his heart out\\". According to LAexcites.com contributor Imaan Jalali, the number demonstrates the character's \\"distinct melancholy that reverberates with the hearts of attendees\\" while \\"he bares his downtrodden soul\\". The Beast later reprises the song after he allows Belle to return home and tend to her ailing father, wondering if he will ever see her again. Conversely, the reprise \\"expresses his own sorrow of remaining in the curse, but more importantly of not winning Belle‚Äôs love\\". Menken summarized the musical number as simply \\"a moment of just crying out to the heavens.\\" The Ottawa Citizen critic Zaina Khan wrote that the ballad indicates \\"a shift from ferocity to humility displaying the Beast‚Äôs dichotomy between ill-tempered rage and instant regret.\\" Similarly, The Plain Dealer contributor Laura DeMarco believes that the song \\"further humanize[s]\\" the Beast. Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal described the musical number's staging as a combination of the stage musicals Les Miserables (1980) and Evita (1978), which is sometimes performed onstage amidst artificial fog. Composition \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" is a melancholy power ballad. Written in the key of C major and performed at a \\"free\\" tempo of 112 beats per minute, the song lasts four minutes and six seconds (4:06) in duration. AllMusic's Peter Fawthrop described the track as \\"dark\\" and \\"mournful\\". Lindsey BahrIt, writing for the Toronto Star, described its melody as \\"soaring\\". The Plain Dealer's Laura DeMarco described the ballad as \\"sentimental\\", while D23 called it \\"heart- wrenching\\". Some critics have deemed \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" an anthem; Holly Beretto of Houstonia identified the song as \\"an anthem to love desired and lost\\" that \\"showcases [the actor's] vocal and acting range.\\" Similarly, Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal dubbed it a \\"lament about lost love\\". Musically, the song begins with \\"soft phrases\\" expressing \\"gentleness and heartfelt emotion, before build[ing]\\" as it grows and progresses. Despite being performed in a major key, the ballad compensates by using \\"vocals, slowness, and mirroring the haunting theme\\" of the score. Variety's Jerome Weeks wrote that the song \\"combines a lovely descending-line melody with one of Rice‚Äôs most touching efforts in the way the Beast haltingly, almost inarticulately grapples with his developing love.\\" Thomas S. Hischak, author of The Disney Song Encyclopedia, observed that the track boasts \\"a resounding, operatic tone that is far heavier\\" than the film's original songs. Vladimir Bunoan of ABS-CBNnews.com compared the ballad to selections from the stage musical The Phantom of the Opera (1986). Jo Litson of Limelight identified the song as a \\"tenor power ballad\\", with Mann's original vocals spanning two octaves, from B3 to F5. Performed in the vocal range of a baritenor, the vocalist performs \\"a high and sustained note\\" while singing the ballad's final line ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt love her, let the world be done with me‚Äù, a lyric Paul Lockwood of the Northwest Herald described as \\"heart-wrenching\\". Lyrically, the protagonist wonders who he can love \\"If [he] can't love her\\". Beginning \\"And in my twisted face there's not the slightest trace of anything that even hints of kindness\\", the song's lyrics convey \\"hope and hopelessness, the pain and beauty of love, and the anguish of loss.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Clark Collis wrote that the song is about \\"How am I going to fall in love with her?\\".  Critical reception  The song has received positive reviews from critics, who praised Menken and Rice's songwriting, as well as the performances of Mann and subsequent actors. Variety's Jeremy Gerard reviewed \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" as Rice's \\"best lyric\\". Also contributing to Variety, Jerome Weeks lauded the ballad, writing that Menken and Rice's efforts particularly \\"shine\\" during \\"If I Can't Love Her\\", while Tom Jacobs opined that \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" \\"makes the strongest impact\\" among Menken and Rice's new material, complimenting Mann's \\"passionate rendition\\". Reviewing Justin Glaser's rendition at the Blaisdell Concert Hall, John Berger of the Honolulu Star-Advertiser wrote that the actor \\"brings Act I to a stirring and passionate close with 'If I Can‚Äôt Love Her'\\". The Times-Picayune critic Theodore P. Mahne wrote that Jason Kyle Dowies \\"solid vocals burst forth with power and passion\\". The Greenville News critic Paul Hyde called Chase Wolfe's version at the South Carolina Children's Theatre \\"impassioned\\", while Bob Curtright of The Wichita Eagle wrote that Thaddeus Pearson's rendition \\"is particularly powerful and heartbreaking\\". Other critics have commended ways in which the song expands the Beast's character. Melissa Taylor of the Houston Chronicle believes that the song offers the Beast \\"a gloomily relatable interiority\\" that the film otherwise lacked. Reviewing a performance at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, Boca Raton Magazine wrote that \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" provides \\"deeper emotional understanding to the sorrows of both [the Beast and Belle]\\", while calling it a beautiful conclusion to the first act. Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal opined that the number provides the character with his \\"best roar\\". Andra Abramson of DC Metro Theater Arts identified \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" as the show's only original song that does not \\"pale in comparison to the familiar songs from the movie.\\" Conversely, Sean Daly of the Tampa Bay Times dismissed the song as a \\"hookless yearner\\", while the Edmonton Journal deemed it \\"generic\\" despite its \\"quivering intensity\\", writing \\"the Phantom might easily have taken [it] on, if he felt like padding out his stage time.\\" Covers and impact 260x260px Singer and actor James Graeme covered \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" with the National Symphony Orchestra for the compilation album The Very Best Of Broadway Musicals (2002). In 2004, actor Ron Raines included his rendition of the ballad on his album So In Love With Broadway (2004). Singer Josh Groban covered the song and included it on deluxe versions of his studio album Stages (2015), sold exclusively at Target. The track is cited as a \\"Target exclusive track\\". Actor Kane Alexander covered \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" for his Broadway- themed studio album Kane Alexander: Different Stages (The Broadway Album) (2017). The song was nearly incorporated into the 2017 live-action remake of the animated film. Menken and director Bill Condon had originally wanted to use \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" but ultimately concluded that the film lacked an appropriate moment at which the Beast could sing it, determining that the character could only sing after he had released Belle. Although Menken and Rice had considered re-writing the song's lyrics to suit the scene, they ultimately decided to write an entirely new ballad instead, which became \\"Evermore\\". Condon explained that \\"Onstage, you can have a character express his feelings for three minutes in a beautiful, powerful song\\" whereas \\"In a movie, that character has to be somewhere different at the end of the song from where he starts, the story has to keep on.\\" The filmmakers also determined that the original song was not suitable for the film's three-act structure, as the Beast's solo occurs later in the film than it does in the musical. Menken joked that \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" was written \\"specifically for the act break of a Broadway show; in a film, people aren't going out to go to the bathroom and get drinks.\\" Menken maintains that he would have included \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" in the film if given the option. Comparing the two ballads, actor Dan Stevens, who portrays Beast in the remake and recorded \\"Evermore\\", wrote that the new song is about \\"I‚Äôve fallen in love with her, and now she‚Äôs buggered off, woe is me\\" whereas \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" muses \\"How am I going to fall in love with her?\\". Critics consider \\"Evermore\\" to be a replacement for \\"If I Can't Love Her\\", to which it was compared. Maria Sciullo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the new song \\"lacks the sheer power of 'If I Can‚Äôt Love Her,'\\" despite being \\"more upbeat in spirit\\". ReelViews' James Berardinelli called \\"Evermore\\" \\"solid, although perhaps not as good as 'If I Can‚Äôt Love Her'.\\" After debuting in the musical, \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" proved to be very popular among fans. \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" is considered to be one of Mann's signature songs. Since becoming a professor of musical theatre at Western Carolina University, Mann has observed that \\"If I Can't Love Her\\" is one of three songs from his stage career regarded as standards for male students due to how much his role in Beauty and the Beast resonated among fans.

It was the first season of a restructured two- division competition, in which automatic promotion and relegation between the divisions was abandoned. The Division 1 premiership was won by the Port Melbourne Football Club, after it defeated Preston in the Grand Final on 19 September by seven points; it was Port Melbourne's 15th Division 1 premiership, the third of three premierships won in a row between 1980 and 1982, and the last of six premierships won in nine seasons from 1974 until 1982. The Division 2 premiership was won by Northcote; it was the club's second Division 2 premiership, and it was the last premiership ever won by the club. Association structure =Restructure of Division 2= In the late 1970s, the popularity and financial viability of the Association was in decline. One factor contributing to this came about as a result of the promotion and relegation system which existed between the two divisions: this system, which had been in place since 1961, saw promotion for the Division 2 premiers and relegation for the Division 1 wooden-spooners at the end of each season, giving a fair opportunity for promotion and relegation based on on- field performance; but, the automatic nature of this promotion and relegation meant that no consideration was given to the off-field strength of the club, which was the most critical factor in determining a club's viability. By the late 1970s, there was a growing off-field gap between the strongest and weakest clubs, and the fickle correlation between off-field strength and on- field finishing positions meant that some strong clubs were stuck in Division 2 and some weak clubs were holding their places in Division 1. This had a wide range of consequences detrimental to the Association as a whole. The conclusion was that the Association would be more viable if the clubs which made up Division 1 were selected based on off-field merit and viability, rather than on-field results. A new structure, which was first proposed in September 1980 under Alex Gillon's presidency, was ratified in May 1981 under Alan Wickes' presidency by a margin of 19‚Äì4, well in excess of the three- quarters majority required. Under the new structure: *Division 1 was expanded from ten to twelve clubs. *Division 2 could be expanded to as many as twelve clubs, with the final number depending upon the number of suitable applicants. *The clubs in Division 1 were selected by the Association executive committee based on the following criteria, in order of importance: quality of administration; financial position; quality of facilities; long-term potential of the club; on-field performance; on-field and off-field reputation; development programs for junior players; local attitudes towards Sunday football. *Promotion and relegation between the divisions was decided at the end of the season at the discretion of the executive committee, based on the same criteria. *Automatic promotion and relegation for the Division 2 premiers and the Division 1 wooden spooner was abolished. This lasted only for two seasons, and was reinstated during the 1983 season. The Association also encouraged a number of its weaker clubs to consider amalgamating with neighbouring clubs to improve long-term viability, although it stopped short of forcing amalgamations. As many as fourteen of the Association's twenty clubs were sent letters on the matter of amalgamation during 1981 ‚Äì Prahran and Caulfield, Box Hill and Camberwell, and Oakleigh and Waverley were amongst the pairs of clubs known to have been approached ‚Äì but no amalgamations resulted. =Promotion and relegation for 1982= The composition of the new Division 1 was announced on 7 September 1981, the day after the 1981 Division 2 Grand Final. Four Division 2 clubs were promoted to the expanded Division 1 in 1982: *Camberwell (premiers in 1981), which was enjoying good local support after two Division 2 premierships in three years, and had been secure off- field during its one season in Division 1 in 1980. The club repaid the Association's faith by being one of the strongest crowd-drawing clubs in 1982. *Waverley (runners-up in 1981). Waverley was considered a surprise promotion by noted Association sportswriter Marc Fiddian, because through the 1970s it was one of the lowest-drawing clubs in the Association, while its nearest neighbour Oakleigh had been one of Division 1's highest drawcards before it was relegated; but, Oakleigh had an increasing Greek migrant population, so its long-term potential was thought to be seriously threatened by soccer, giving Waverley an off-field edge. *Werribee (fourth in 1981). Once described as \\"the lonesome battler\\" of the Association, up to 1980 the outer western suburban club had struggled through its sixteen seasons in Division 2 for one finals appearance and four wooden spoons. However, it was almost at the end of an ambitious five-year plan which saw the club build its finances, improve its on-field performance to reach the finals in 1981, and open a $200k social club in 1980. This off-field strength and potential saw the club promoted to Division 1, and it did not disappoint, attracting a huge crowd of 10,000 to a home game against Port Melbourne in May, and continuing to draw strongly through the year. *Williamstown (seventh in 1981). Despite fair-to-middling performances in Division 2 since being relegated after the 1977 season, Williamstown (the longest-serving club still in the Association) was still one of the most financially stable and well supported clubs in the lower division. The changes also helped to spread Division 1 more evenly across Melbourne: Werribee and Williamstown were the first western suburban clubs in Division 1 since 1977, and Waverley's inclusion provided more representation to the sprawling south-eastern suburbs. Two Division 1 clubs were relegated for 1982: *Brunswick (tenth in 1981). It had been widely recognised over previous years that Brunswick was one of the clubs worst-affected by an increase in the European migrant population in its locality, and the subsequent inability to compete with soccer; and therefore its long-term potential was not considered strong enough for the restructured Division 1. *Caulfield (ninth in 1981). Caulfield's case to remain in Division 1 was most affected by the small, poor quality facilities at its home ground at Princes Park. Two other clubs who were considered for relegation but held their places were: Geelong West, who had gone through but recovered from a severe financial crisis in 1980-81; and Coburg, who, like Brunswick, was suffering from a low fanbase due to demographic shifts in its locality. Association membership Two new clubs joined Division 2 for the 1982 season. These were the first new admissions to the Association since Frankston joined in 1966. The new clubs were: *Springvale ‚Äì One of the Federal League's strongest clubs, Springvale had long been considered a candidate for Association membership. The club had turned down an offer to join the Association in 1961, and had applied to join in 1978 but been turned down because the Association was not interested in expanding at the time. Springvale was accepted as the ninth club on 16 October 1981. *Kilsyth ‚Äì A small club from the outer eastern suburbs, the Kilsyth Cougars had finished last in the second division of the Eastern District Football League in 1981. Kilsyth was admitted as the tenth club on 13 November 1981. Kilsyth is historically considered to be a surprise admission, given its small size and lack of local success. The Association had harboured strategic interests in expanding to the outer eastern suburbs since the mid-1960s, but the larger Ringwood Football Club was usually considered the most likely club to gain admission. Kilsyth hoped that despite being a small club, it would still be able to attract EDFL players from the wider Ringwood and Croydon area who aspired to play in the VFA. Altogether, seven clubs applied to join, although the identities of the unsuccessful candidates were never formally revealed. North Ballarat, Ringwood and Greensborough were among the clubs speculated to have applied. The two new clubs brought the total size of the Association to twenty-two clubs, a new record. Division 1 was expanded to twelve clubs, and Division 2 remained constant at ten clubs. Division 1 Although Division 1 expanded from ten clubs to twelve clubs, the home-and-away season continued to be played over 18 rounds, rather than being expanded to 22 rounds. This meant that not all pairs of teams played both home and away against each other. The top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. The finals were played at the Junction Oval. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the season was Fred Cook (Port Melbourne), who kicked 127 goals during the home-and-away season and 140 goals overall. *The J. J. Liston Trophy was originally decided by a countback, after three players finished level on 20 votes. Geoff Austen (Preston) originally won the award outright, with five first preferences; Bill Swan (Port Melbourne) was second, with four first preferences and four second preferences; and David Wenn (Dandenong), was third with four first preferences and three second preferences. Following a decision made in 1989, the countback was retrospectively eliminated, and all three players are now recognized as joint Liston Trophy winners. *Sandringham won the seconds premiership. Sandringham 18.10 (118) defeated Preston 12.15 (87) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the seniors Grand Final on 19 September. Division 2 The Division 2 home-and-away season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system; all finals were played on Sundays at Toorak Park. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the Division 2 was Ted Carroll (Springvale), who kicked 118 goals in the home-and-away season and did not participate in finals. *The J. Field Medal was originally won outright by Mark Williams (Sunshine), who polled 25 votes; Russ Hodges (Kilsyth) was originally second, after also polling 25 votes but finishing behind Williams on countback. Following a decision made in 1989, the countback was retrospectively eliminated, and both players are now recognized as joint Field Medallists. Ted Carroll (Springvale) finished third with 14 votes. *Springvale won the Seconds premiership in its first season. Springvale 16.8 (104) defeated Northcote 15.11 (101) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior Grand Final on 12 September. Notable events =Interleague matches= The Association's Division 1 and Division 2 teams each played two interleague matches during the season, including the Association's first ever matches against the Victorian Amateur Football Association. Fred Cook (Port Melbourne) captained the Division 1 team and Gary Brice (Port Melbourne) was coach; Jim Christou (Northcote) captained Division 2 against the S.A.F.A., and Russ Hodges (Kilsyth) captained Division 2 against the V.A.F.A. after Christou was unavailable through injury. =Other notable events= *Network Ten did not renew its agreement to televise Association games in 1982. The network had shown live telecasts of Association games over fifteen years from 1967 until 1981, but opted not to continue. One sticking point in the negotiations surrounded the use of a central ground: Network Ten had been keen for the televised game to be played at the same venue each week; the Association arranged for the Junction Oval to be available in this capacity, but Ten worried that the small Association crowds would give a poor atmosphere in such a large venue. Some clubs, including Prahran and Dandenong, struggled to find strong sponsorship after the television deal ended. *Two field umpires were used in all matches across both the home-and-away season and finals in Division 2 starting from this season. This change had been made in Division 1 in 1981. *To coincide with the change in umpires, the voting system for the J. J. Liston Trophy and the J. Field Medal were both changed in 1982. Under the new system, the two field umpires conferred after the game, and awarded one set of votes to the best three players on the ground on a 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 basis. *On 11 April, Springvale scored more than 200 points in only its second Association game: Springvale 35.15 (225) d. Sunshine 18.17 (125). *On 11 April, Chris Rourke kicked a goal after the final siren to secure victory for Camberwell against Preston; Camberwell 18.13 (121) d. Preston 17.17 (119). *In the match between Frankston and Geelong West at Frankston Park on 6 June, Simon Taylor (Geelong West) kicked a very late goal to secure a five-point victory; Geelong West 20.10 (130) d. Frankston 17.23 (125). Frankston argued that Taylor's goal was kicked slightly after the final siren had sounded and lodged an official protest against the result. Frankston contended that controlling umpire Neil Griffith had failed to hear the siren, but non-controlling umpire Frank Vergona had heard the siren and signalled the end of play before the goal was kicked; the two umpires had conferred before awarding the goal. The Association rejected Frankston's protest on the grounds that the umpires acted within the laws of the game by awarding the goal based on their judgement of when the siren had sounded, but it did concede that the goal was probably scored after time had expired, found that the timekeepers should have sounded the siren for longer, and sent a memorandum to all clubs to check the volume of their sirens. *Yarraville captain-coach John Sharp was reported in five separate matches during the season. On the fourth occasion, on 25 July against Mordialloc, he was suspended for a total of sixteen weeks for kicking and striking an opponent, and for attempting to knock the goal umpire's hat off; and, he was found not guilty of the more serious offences of striking a goal umpire and tripping a field umpire. Two weeks later, while coaching from the boundary line, he was reported again on four charges of using abusive language, and was suspended indefinitely from serving in any position in the Association, ending his career. Sharp had a long history of reports and suspensions, and under his leadership a total of fifteen Yarraville players were reported during the season. *In the Division 2 preliminary final, Caulfield trailed Oakleigh by as much as eight goals during the third quarter, but recovered to win the match by 26 points. *At the Division 2 Grand Final, $5000 in cash ‚Äì amounting to nearly half of the $11,000 gate ‚Äì was stolen from the Toorak Park rooms. It was never recovered.

He began his legal practice in 1979, and is known for taking on widely reviled high-profile clients that other lawyers have shunned. In 2013\\"Le top 30 des avocats les plus puissants de France\\" , GQ, November 2013, p. 133. and 2014 GQ ranked him the sixth most powerful lawyer of France. He experienced a turning point in his career around 1990, when he joined the defense team in the COGEDIM affair (bogus invoices produced by an important building company) and the one of Henri Emmanuelli (in another affair of bogus invoices). Indeed, as a result, he gradually moved from cases of general criminal law to white collar criminality (without giving up the cases of murder, rape and terrorism entirely).; He defended Edmond Herv√© in the ministers' trial of the Infected blood scandal in 1999, after years of investigations and procedure;\\"Mis en examen dans l'affaire du sang contamin√© ‚Äì Edmond Herv√© a √©t√© interrog√© sur le fonctionnement du secr√©tariat d'Etat √† la sant√© entre 1984 et 1986\\", Le Monde, 30 September 1994; France 2, July 17, 1998 ; \\"La d√©fense demande √† la Cour de se r√©f√©rer uniquement au droit p√©nal\\", Le Monde, 27 February 1999. Gilles M√©nage (former chief of staff of Fran√ßois Mitterrand) in the trial (2005) of the Presidency's abusive wiretappings (1983‚Äì1986);\\"L'avocat de Gilles M√©nage \\"n'ira pas plus loin\\"\\", Le Monde, 24 f√©vrier 2005. and S√©bastien de Montessus, former director of mines of Areva, sued by his own ex-boss, Anne Lauvergeon, for alleged spying of her private life (S√©bastien de Montessus has been acquitted). One of his most unpopular clients was Fabrice Burgaud, made famous by the Outreau affair. He defended him in front of the (CSM, Higher Judicial Council), and sued two national newspapers as well as Bertrand Tavernier for libel. The newspapers and the movie director have been sentenced. In 2009, Maisonneuve defended the Church of Scientology on charges of profiting illegally. He is defence lawyer for Yoo Som-na, the eldest daughter of Yoo Byung-eun and Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund Regardless, Maisonneuve is on the plaintiffs' side in some important cases, especially the case of the against Laboratoires Servier (Mediator scandal) and the one of the European Parliament against Marine Le Pen. On 26 May 2014, Maisonneuve revealed during a press conference that the company , for which he is the lawyer, made bogus invoices as a result of the pressure exerted by the staff of Nicolas Sarkozy and by the UMP: instead of making bills for Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign, Bygmalion was requested to exaggerate or to invent works for the UMP's ordinary activities, because the electoral expenses exceeded the legal spending limit. Patrick Maisonneuve estimated the total amount of the fake invoices to \\"more than 10 million euros\\" and called the demand of the UMP for \\"financial blackmail\\". The next day, the chairman of the UMP, Jean- Fran√ßois Cop√© announced his resignation. The criminal investigation accelerated during the following months. In the name of his clients, Patrick Maisonneuve also filed three complaints against Le Point, who, in three different articles, had accused Bygmalion of profiting illegally (an accusation never endorsed by the investigative magistrates in charge of the case). After Nicolas Sarkozy was formally indicted in February 2016, Patrick Maisonneuve expressed his satisfaction and reiterated his position: The bogus invoices were all about the excessive expenses of Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign.

The brand name The name Chibuku comes from Max Heinrich's habit of recording all consumers' comments and process changes in a book, and Chibuku is an adaptation of the local word for \\"book\\" - \\"Chi\\" is the pre-fix meaning \\"big\\", \\"buk\\" = \\"book\\", and the terminal \\"u\\" is because most African nouns tend to end in a euphonic vowel. The shake-shake comes from the ritual of first shaking up the beer before taking the first sip. The beer contains starch, the germ and yeast (all normally removed in lagers and ales) and since the solids settle to the bottom of the carton, it needs to be shaken before sipping. Alcohol content The alcohol content in a fresh Chibuku is fairly low starting at about 0.5% ABV on day one, but as fermentation continues in the carton, the longer it is kept before drinking, the stronger it gets. It may achieve 4% ABV before the shelf-life expires after between 4 and 6 days after packaging. The brand Chibuku is a pan-African brand of opaque sorghum beer made by various brewers across Africa. Part of the reason for the success of the brand is the commercial brewing process with systems to ensure a consistent product quality product that is safe for consumers. Chibuku is often the choice of less affluent consumers who can't afford bottled beer, and this may still be the case for many of the consumers in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Botswana. However there are also consumers in the emerging middle class who enjoy the beer as a preference, because of the taste and for the health connotations.

Cecil Marquand was born at Richmond, Surrey, on 7 June 1897. He was the only son of Ernest David Marquand, the author of a Flora of Guernsey. Educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, from 1906 to 1910, he attended Lyc√©e Henri-IV in Paris for a year before entering Bedford School (1911-1913). Marquand then went to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. in 1919, proceeding to M.A. in 1922. Marquand's education was interrupted by service in the British Army during World War I. He first served in the Machine Gun Corps before gaining a commission in the Royal Tank Corps. Marquand's military service ended when he was invalided out from the Tank Corps. Sprague, T. A. (1943). Obituary - Mr. C. V. B. Marquand. Nature. 152, 322-323 (18 September 1943). Career On leaving Cambridge in 1919, Marquand was appointed research assistant, investigating Avena at the new Welsh Plant Breeding Station at Aberystwyth. In 1923, he moved to the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, where he worked as an assistant in the Herbarium, initially continuing his work on grasses before taking charge of the Chinese section. Marquand wrote numerous papers on the flora of East Asia, notably on Cyananthus, Buddleja and gentians. His private interest was Bryophytes, which he studied in the Alps and the highlands of Great Britain during his vacations. Death His health permanently impaired from the war, Marquand took early retirement from Kew in 1939. He then moved to the isle of Skye in Scotland. Marquand drowned there on 1 July 1943, while on a boating expedition in search of rare algae.

Its study has origins in the work of Ernst Kummer on ideal numbers from the 1840s, who in particular proved that for every algebraic number field there exists an extension number field such that all ideals of the ring of integers of the base field (which can always be generated by at most two elements) become principal when extended to the larger field. In 1897 David Hilbert conjectured that the maximal abelian unramified extension of the base field, which was later called the Hilbert class field of the given base field, is such an extension. This conjecture, now known as principal ideal theorem, was proved by Philipp Furtw√§ngler in 1930 after it had been translated from number theory to group theory by Emil Artin in 1929, who made use of his general reciprocity law to establish the reformulation. Since this long desired proof was achieved by means of Artin transfers of non-abelian groups with derived length two, several investigators tried to exploit the theory of such groups further to obtain additional information on the principalization in intermediate fields between the base field and its Hilbert class field. The first contributions in this direction are due to Arnold Scholz and Olga Taussky in 1934, who coined the synonym capitulation for principalization. Another independent access to the principalization problem via Galois cohomology of unit groups is also due to Hilbert and goes back to the chapter on cyclic extensions of number fields of prime degree in his number report, which culminates in the famous Theorem 94. Extension of classes Let K be an algebraic number field, called the base field, and let L/K be a field extension of finite degree. Let \\\\mathcal{O}_K,\\\\mathcal{I}_K,\\\\mathcal{P}_K and \\\\mathcal{O}_L,\\\\mathcal{I}_L,\\\\mathcal{P}_L denote the ring of integers, the group of nonzero fractional ideals and its subgroup of principal fractional ideals of the fields K,L respectively. Then the extension map of fractional ideals :\\\\begin{cases}\\\\iota_{L/K}: \\\\mathcal{I}_K\\\\to\\\\mathcal{I}_L \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mapsto\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{O}_L \\\\end{cases} is an injective group homomorphism. Since \\\\iota_{L/K}(\\\\mathcal{P}_K)\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{P}_L, this map induces the extension homomorphism of ideal class groups :\\\\begin{cases}j_{L/K}: \\\\mathcal{I}_K/\\\\mathcal{P}_K\\\\to\\\\mathcal{I}_L/\\\\mathcal{P}_L  \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{P}_K \\\\mapsto (\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{O}_L) \\\\mathcal{P}_L \\\\end{cases} If there exists a non-principal ideal \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}_K (i.e. \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\mathcal{P}_K e \\\\mathcal{P}_K) whose extension ideal in L is principal (i.e. \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\mathcal{O}_L =A\\\\mathcal{O}_L for some A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_L and (\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{O}_L)\\\\mathcal{P}_L=(A\\\\mathcal{O}_L)\\\\mathcal{P}_L=\\\\mathcal{P}_L), then we speak about principalization or capitulation in L/K. In this case, the ideal \\\\mathfrak{a} and its class \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{P}_K are said to principalize or capitulate in L. This phenomenon is described most conveniently by the principalization kernel or capitulation kernel, that is the kernel \\\\ker(j_{L/K}) of the class extension homomorphism. More generally, let \\\\mathfrak{m}=\\\\mathfrak{m}_0\\\\mathfrak{m}_\\\\infty be a modulus in K, where \\\\mathfrak{m}_0 is a nonzero ideal in \\\\mathcal{O}_K and \\\\mathfrak{m}_\\\\infty is a formal product of pair-wise different real infinite primes of K. Then :\\\\mathcal{S}_{K,\\\\mathfrak{m}} =\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\mathcal{O}_K  \\\\alpha\\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak{m}} \\\\rangle \\\\le \\\\mathcal{I}_K (\\\\mathfrak{m}), is the ray modulo \\\\mathfrak{m}, where \\\\mathcal{I}_K (\\\\mathfrak{m}) =\\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{m}_0) is the group of nonzero fractional ideals in K relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{m}_0 and the condition \\\\alpha \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak{m}} means \\\\alpha \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak{m}_0} and v(\\\\alpha)>0 for every real infinite prime v dividing \\\\mathfrak{m}_\\\\infty. Let \\\\mathcal{S}_{K,\\\\mathfrak{m}} \\\\le \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\le \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{m}), then the group \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{m})/\\\\mathcal{H} is called a generalized ideal class group for \\\\mathfrak{m}. If \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{m}_K)/\\\\mathcal{H}_K and \\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{m}_L) /\\\\mathcal{H}_L are generalized ideal class groups such that \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\mathcal{O}_L \\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{m}_L) for every \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{m}_K) and \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\mathcal{O}_L \\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}_L for every \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}_K, then \\\\iota_{L/K} induces the extension homomorphism of generalized ideal class groups: :\\\\begin{cases} j_{L/K}: \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{m}_K)/\\\\mathcal{H}_K\\\\to\\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{m}_L)/\\\\mathcal{H}_L  \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{H}_K\\\\mapsto(\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{O}_L)\\\\mathcal{H}_L \\\\end{cases} Galois extensions of number fields Let F/K be a Galois extension of algebraic number fields with Galois group G=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/K) and let \\\\mathbb{P}_K, \\\\mathbb{P}_F denote the set of prime ideals of the fields K,F respectively. Suppose that \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}_K is a prime ideal of K which does not divide the relative discriminant \\\\mathfrak{d}=\\\\mathfrak{d}(F/K), and is therefore unramified in F, and let \\\\mathfrak{P} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}_F be a prime ideal of F lying over \\\\mathfrak{p}. =Frobenius automorphism= There exists a unique automorphism \\\\sigma\\\\in G such that A^{\\\\mathrm{N}(\\\\mathfrak{p})} \\\\equiv\\\\sigma(A) \\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak{P}} for all algebraic integers A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_F, where \\\\mathrm{N}(\\\\mathfrak{p}) is the norm of \\\\mathfrak{p}. The map \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}} \\\\right] :=\\\\sigma is called the Frobenius automorphism of \\\\mathfrak{P}. It generates the decomposition group D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\in G\\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{P})=\\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\\\\\} of \\\\mathfrak{P} and its order is equal to the inertia degree f:=f(\\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\mathfrak{p})=[\\\\mathcal{O}_F/ \\\\mathfrak{P}: \\\\mathcal{O}_K/\\\\mathfrak{p}] of \\\\mathfrak{P} over \\\\mathfrak{p}. (If \\\\mathfrak{p} is ramified then \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right] is only defined and generates D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} modulo the inertia subgroup :I_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\in G\\\\sigma(A)\\\\equiv A\\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\text{ for all } A\\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_F\\\\\\\\} =\\\\ker(D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} \\\\to\\\\mathrm{Gal}(\\\\mathcal{O}_F/\\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\mathcal{O}_K/\\\\mathfrak{p})) whose order is the ramification index e(\\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\mathfrak{p}) of \\\\mathfrak{P} over \\\\mathfrak{p}). Any other prime ideal of F dividing \\\\mathfrak{p} is of the form \\\\tau(\\\\mathfrak{P}) with some \\\\tau\\\\in G. Its Frobenius automorphism is given by :\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\tau(\\\\mathfrak{P})}\\\\right]=\\\\tau\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]\\\\tau^{-1}, since :\\\\tau(A)^{\\\\mathrm{N}(\\\\mathfrak{p})}\\\\equiv(\\\\tau\\\\sigma\\\\tau^{-1})(\\\\tau(A))\\\\bmod{\\\\tau(\\\\mathfrak{P})} for all A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_F, and thus its decomposition group D_{\\\\tau(\\\\mathfrak{P})}=\\\\tau D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\tau^{-1} is conjugate to D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}. In this general situation, the Artin symbol is a mapping :\\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mapsto\\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right):=\\\\left. \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\tau\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]\\\\tau^{-1} \\\\right  \\\\tau\\\\in G\\\\right\\\\\\\\} which associates an entire conjugacy class of automorphisms to any unramified prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} mid\\\\mathfrak{d}, and we have \\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)=1 if and only if \\\\mathfrak{p} splits completely in F. =Factorization of prime ideals= When K\\\\subseteq L\\\\subseteq F is an intermediate field with relative Galois group H=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/L)\\\\le G, more precise statements about the homomorphisms \\\\iota_{L/K} and j_{L/K} are possible because we can construct the factorization of \\\\mathfrak{p} (where \\\\mathfrak{p} is unramified in F as above) in \\\\mathcal{O}_L from its factorization in \\\\mathcal{O}_F as follows. Prime ideals in \\\\mathcal{O}_F lying over \\\\mathfrak{p} are in G-equivariant bijection with the G-set of left cosets G/D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}, where \\\\tau(\\\\mathfrak{P}) corresponds to the coset \\\\tau D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}. For every prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{q} in \\\\mathcal{O}_L lying over \\\\mathfrak{p} the Galois group H acts transitively on the set of prime ideals in \\\\mathcal{O}_F lying over \\\\mathfrak{q}, thus such ideals \\\\mathfrak{q} are in bijection with the orbits of the action of H on G/D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} by left multiplication. Such orbits are in turn in bijection with the double cosets H\\\\backslash G/D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}. Let (\\\\tau_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\tau_g) be a complete system of representatives of these double cosets, thus G=\\\\dot{\\\\cup}_{i=1}^g\\\\,H\\\\tau_iD_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}. Furthermore, let H\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} denote the orbit of the coset \\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} in the action of H on the set of left cosets G/D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} by left multiplication and let H\\\\tau_i\\\\cdot D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} denote the orbit of the coset H\\\\tau_i in the action of D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} on the set of right cosets H\\\\backslash G by right multiplication. Then \\\\mathfrak{p} factorizes in \\\\mathcal{O}_L as \\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mathcal{O}_L=\\\\prod_{i=1}^g\\\\mathfrak{q}_i, where \\\\mathfrak{q}_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}_L for 1\\\\le i\\\\le g are the prime ideals lying over \\\\mathfrak{p} in L satisfying \\\\mathfrak{q}_i\\\\mathcal{O}_F=\\\\prod_{\\\\varrho}\\\\varrho(\\\\mathfrak{P}) with the product running over any system of representatives of H\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}. We have :\\\\\\\\#(H\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}})\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\#D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}=\\\\\\\\#H\\\\tau_iD_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}=\\\\\\\\#(H\\\\tau_i\\\\cdot D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}})\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\#H. Let D_i be the decomposition group of \\\\tau_i(\\\\mathfrak{P}) over L. Then D_i=H\\\\cap D_{\\\\tau_i(\\\\mathfrak{P})} is the stabilizer of \\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}} in the action of H on G/D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}, so by the orbit-stabilizer theorem we have \\\\\\\\#D_i=\\\\\\\\#H/\\\\\\\\#(H\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}). On the other hand, it's \\\\\\\\#D_i=f(\\\\tau_i(\\\\mathfrak{P})\\\\mathfrak{q}_i), which together gives :f(\\\\mathfrak{q}_i\\\\mathfrak{p}) = \\\\frac{f(\\\\tau_i(\\\\mathfrak{P})\\\\mathfrak{p})}{f(\\\\tau_i(\\\\mathfrak{P})\\\\mathfrak{q}_i)}= \\\\frac{f(\\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\mathfrak{p})}{\\\\\\\\#D_i}= \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}}{\\\\\\\\#H/\\\\\\\\#(H\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}})}= \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#(H\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}})\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\#D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}}{\\\\\\\\#H}= \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#H\\\\tau_iD_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}}{\\\\\\\\#H}= \\\\\\\\#(H\\\\tau_i\\\\cdot D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}). In other words, the inertia degree f_i:=f(\\\\mathfrak{q}_i\\\\mathfrak{p}) is equal to the size of the orbit of the coset H\\\\tau_i in the action of \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right] on the set of right cosets H\\\\backslash G by right multiplication. By taking inverses, this is equal to the size of the orbit D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i^{-1}H of the coset \\\\tau_i^{-1}H in the action of \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right] on the set of left cosets G/H by left multiplication. Also the prime ideals in \\\\mathcal{O}_L lying over \\\\mathfrak{p} correspond to the orbits of this action. Consequently, the ideal embedding is given by \\\\iota_{L/K}(\\\\mathfrak{p})=\\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mathcal{O}_L =\\\\prod_{i=1}^g\\\\mathfrak{q}_i, and the class extension by :j_{L/K}(\\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mathcal{H}_K)=(\\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mathcal{O}_L)\\\\mathcal{H}_L=\\\\prod_{i=1}^g \\\\mathfrak{q}_i\\\\mathcal{H}_L. =Artin's reciprocity law= Now further assume F/K is an abelian extension, that is, G is an abelian group. Then, all conjugate decomposition groups of prime ideals of F lying over \\\\mathfrak{p} coincide, thus D_{\\\\mathfrak{p}}:=D_{\\\\tau(\\\\mathfrak{P})} for every \\\\tau\\\\in G, and the Artin symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)=\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right] becomes equal to the Frobenius automorphism of any \\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\mid\\\\mathfrak{p} and A^{\\\\mathrm{N}(\\\\mathfrak{p})}\\\\equiv\\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)(A)\\\\bmod{\\\\mathfrak{P}} for all A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_F and every \\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\mid\\\\mathfrak{p}. By class field theory, the abelian extension F/K uniquely corresponds to an intermediate group \\\\mathcal{S}_{K,\\\\mathfrak{f}} \\\\le\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\le \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{f}) between the ray modulo \\\\mathfrak{f} of K and \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{f}), where \\\\mathfrak{f}=\\\\mathfrak{f}_0\\\\mathfrak{f}_\\\\infty=\\\\mathfrak{f}(F/K) denotes the relative conductor (\\\\mathfrak{f}_0 is divisible by the same prime ideals as \\\\mathfrak{d}). The Artin symbol :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathbb{P}_K(\\\\mathfrak{f})\\\\to G \\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mapsto\\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)\\\\end{cases} which associates the Frobenius automorphism of \\\\mathfrak{p} to each prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} of K which is unramified in F, can be extended by multiplicativity to a surjective homomorphism :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{f})\\\\to G \\\\mathfrak{a}=\\\\prod \\\\mathfrak{p}^{v_{\\\\mathfrak{p}}(\\\\mathfrak{a})}\\\\mapsto\\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{a}}\\\\right):=\\\\prod \\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)^{v_{\\\\mathfrak{p}}(\\\\mathfrak{a})}\\\\end{cases} with kernel \\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\mathcal{S}_{K,\\\\mathfrak{f}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{N}_{F/K}(\\\\mathcal{I}_F(\\\\mathfrak{f})) (where \\\\mathcal{I}_F(\\\\mathfrak{f}) means \\\\mathcal{I}_F(\\\\mathfrak{f}_0\\\\mathcal{O}_F)), called Artin map, which induces isomorphism :\\\\begin{cases}\\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{f})/\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\to G=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/K) \\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\mapsto\\\\left(\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{a}} \\\\right) \\\\end{cases} of the generalized ideal class group \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{f})/\\\\mathcal{H} to the Galois group G. This explicit isomorphism is called the Artin reciprocity law or general reciprocity law. Figure 1: Commutative diagram connecting the class extension with the Artin transfer. Group-theoretic formulation of the problem This reciprocity law allowed Artin to translate the general principalization problem for number fields K\\\\subseteq L\\\\subseteq F based on the following scenario from number theory to group theory. Let F/K be a Galois extension of algebraic number fields with automorphism group G=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/K). Assume that K\\\\subseteq L\\\\subseteq F is an intermediate field with relative group H= \\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/L)\\\\le G and let K'/K, L'/L be the maximal abelian subextension of K, L respectively within F. Then the corresponding relative groups are the commutator subgroups G'=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/K')\\\\le G, resp. H'=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F/L')\\\\le H. By class field theory, there exist intermediate groups \\\\mathcal{S}_{K,\\\\mathfrak{m}_K} \\\\le\\\\mathcal{H}_K\\\\le \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{d}) and \\\\mathcal{S}_{L,\\\\mathfrak{m}_L}\\\\le\\\\mathcal{H}_L\\\\le\\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{d}) such that the Artin maps establish isomorphisms :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\left(\\\\frac{K'/K}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right):\\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{d})/\\\\mathcal{H}_K\\\\to\\\\mathrm{Gal}(K'/K)\\\\simeq G/G'  &\\\\left(\\\\frac{L'/L}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right):\\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{d})/\\\\mathcal{H}_L\\\\to\\\\mathrm{Gal}(L'/L)\\\\simeq H/H' \\\\end{align} Here \\\\mathfrak{d}=\\\\mathfrak{d}(F/K), \\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{d}) means \\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{d}\\\\mathcal{O}_L) and \\\\mathfrak{m}_K,\\\\mathfrak{m}_L are some moduli divisible by \\\\mathfrak{f}(K'/K),\\\\mathfrak{f}(L'/L) respectively and by all primes dividing \\\\mathfrak{d},\\\\mathfrak{d}\\\\mathcal{O}_L respectively. The ideal extension homomorphism \\\\iota_{L/K}:\\\\,\\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{d})\\\\to\\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{d}), the induced Artin transfer \\\\tilde{T}_{G,H} and these Artin maps are connected by the formula :\\\\tilde{T}_{G,H}\\\\circ\\\\left(\\\\frac{K'/K}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{L'/L}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right)\\\\circ \\\\iota_{L/K}. Since \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{d}) is generated by the prime ideals of K which does not divide \\\\mathfrak{d}, it's enough to verify this equality on these generators. Hence suppose that \\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}_K is a prime ideal of K which does not divide \\\\mathfrak{d} and let \\\\mathfrak{P}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}_F be a prime ideal of F lying over \\\\mathfrak{p}. On the one hand, the ideal extension homomorphism \\\\iota_{L/K} maps the ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} of the base field K to the extension ideal \\\\iota_{L/K}(\\\\mathfrak{p})=\\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\mathcal{O}_L=\\\\prod_{i=1}^g \\\\mathfrak{q}_i in the field L, and the Artin map \\\\left(\\\\frac{L'/L}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right) of the field L maps this product of prime ideals to the product of conjugates of Frobenius automorphisms :\\\\prod_{i=1}^g\\\\left(\\\\frac{L'/L}{\\\\mathfrak{q}_i}\\\\right)= \\\\prod_{i=1}^g \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/L}{\\\\tau_i(\\\\mathfrak{P})}\\\\right]\\\\cdot H'= \\\\prod_{i=1}^g \\\\tau_i\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/L}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]\\\\tau_i^{-1}\\\\cdot H'= \\\\prod_{i=1}^g \\\\tau_i\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}} \\\\right]^{f_i} \\\\tau_i^{-1}\\\\cdot H', where the double coset decomposition and its representatives used here is the same as in the last but one section. On the other hand, the Artin map \\\\left(\\\\frac{K'/K}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right) of the base field K maps the ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} to the Frobenius automorphism \\\\left(\\\\frac{K'/K}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)=\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]\\\\cdot G'. The g-tuple (\\\\tau_1^{-1},\\\\ldots,\\\\tau_g^{-1}) is a system of representatives of double cosets D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\backslash G/H, which correspond to the orbits of the action of \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right] on the set of left cosets G/H by left multiplication, and f_i=\\\\\\\\#(H\\\\tau_i\\\\cdot D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}})=\\\\\\\\#(D_{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\cdot\\\\tau_i^{-1}H) is equal to the size of the orbit of coset \\\\tau_i^{-1}H in this action. Hence the induced Artin transfer maps \\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]\\\\cdot G' to the product :\\\\tilde{T}_{G,H}\\\\left(\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]\\\\cdot G'\\\\right)= T_{G,H}\\\\left(\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}} \\\\right] \\\\right)= \\\\prod_{i=1}^g (\\\\tau_i^{-1})^{-1}\\\\left[\\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]^{f_i}\\\\tau_i^{-1}\\\\cdot H'= \\\\prod_{i=1}^g \\\\tau_i \\\\left[ \\\\frac{F/K}{\\\\mathfrak{P}}\\\\right]^{f_i}\\\\tau_i^{-1}\\\\cdot H'. This product expression was the original form of the Artin transfer homomorphism, corresponding to a decomposition of the permutation representation into disjoint cycles. Since the kernels of the Artin maps \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{K'/K}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right) and \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{L'/L}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right) are \\\\mathcal{H}_K and \\\\mathcal{H}_L respectively, the previous formula implies that \\\\iota_{L/K}(\\\\mathcal{H}_K)\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{H}_L. It follows that there is the class extension homomorphism j_{L/K}: \\\\mathcal{I}_K(\\\\mathfrak{d})/\\\\mathcal{H}_K\\\\to\\\\mathcal{I}_L(\\\\mathfrak{d})/\\\\mathcal{H}_L and that j_{L/K} and the induced Artin transfer \\\\tilde{T}_{G,H} are connected by the commutative diagram in Figure 1 via the isomorphisms induced by the Artin maps, that is, we have equality of two composita \\\\tilde{T}_{G,H}\\\\circ\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{K'/K}{\\\\cdot}\\\\right) =\\\\left( \\\\tfrac{L'/L}{\\\\cdot} \\\\right)\\\\circ j_{L/K}. Class field tower The commutative diagram in the previous section, which connects the number theoretic class extension homomorphism j_{L/K} with the group theoretic Artin transfer T_{G,H}, enabled Furtw√§ngler to prove the principal ideal theorem by specializing to the situation that L=F^1(K) is the (first) Hilbert class field of K, that is the maximal abelian unramified extension of K, and F=F^2(K) is the second Hilbert class field of K, that is the maximal metabelian unramified extension of K (and maximal abelian unramified extension of F^1(K)). Then K'=L, L'=F, \\\\mathfrak{d}=\\\\mathcal{O}_K, \\\\mathcal{H}_K=\\\\mathcal{P}_K, \\\\mathcal{H}_L =\\\\mathcal{P}_L and H=G' is the commutator subgroup of G. More precisely, Furtw√§ngler showed that generally the Artin transfer T_{G,G'} from a finite metabelian group G to its derived subgroup G' is a trivial homomorphism. In fact this is true even if G isn't metabelian because we can reduce to the metabelian case by replacing G with G/G. It also holds for infinite groups provided G is finitely generated and [G:G']<\\\\infty. It follows that every ideal of K extends to a principal ideal of F^1(K). However, the commutative diagram comprises the potential for a lot of more sophisticated applications. In the situation that p is a prime number, F=F^2_p(K) is the second Hilbert p-class field of K, that is the maximal metabelian unramified extension of K of degree a power of p, L varies over the intermediate field between K and its first Hilbert p-class field F^1_p(K), and H=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F^2_p(K)/L)\\\\le G=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F^2_p(K)/K) correspondingly varies over the intermediate groups between G and G', computation of all principalization kernels \\\\ker(j_{L/K}) and all p-class groups \\\\mathrm{Cl}_p(L) translates to information on the kernels \\\\ker(T_{G,H}) and targets H/H' of the Artin transfers T_{G,H} and permits the exact specification of the second p-class group G=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(F^2_p(K)/K) of K via pattern recognition, and frequently even allows to draw conclusions about the entire p-class field tower of K, that is the Galois group \\\\mathrm{Gal}(F^{\\\\infty}_p(K)/K) of the maximal unramified pro-p extension F^{\\\\infty}_p(K) of K. These ideas are explicit in the paper of 1934 by A. Scholz and O. Taussky already. At these early stages, pattern recognition consisted of specifying the annihilator ideals, or symbolic orders, and the Schreier relations of metabelian p-groups and subsequently using a uniqueness theorem on group extensions by O. Schreier. Nowadays, we use the p-group generation algorithm of M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien for constructing descendant trees of p-groups and searching patterns, defined by kernels and targets of Artin transfers, among the vertices of these trees. Galois cohomology In the chapter on cyclic extensions of number fields of prime degree of his number report from 1897, D. Hilbert proves a series of crucial theorems which culminate in Theorem 94, the original germ of class field theory. Today, these theorems can be viewed as the beginning of what is now called Galois cohomology. Hilbert considers a finite relative extension L/K of algebraic number fields with cyclic Galois group G=\\\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)=\\\\langle\\\\sigma\\\\rangle generated by an automorphism \\\\sigma such that \\\\sigma^\\\\ell=1 for the relative degree \\\\ell=[ L:K], which is assumed to be an odd prime. He investigates two endomorphism of the unit group U=U_L of the extension field, viewed as a Galois module with respect to the group G, briefly a G-module. The first endomorphism :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\Delta: U\\\\to U  E\\\\mapsto E^{\\\\sigma-1}:=\\\\sigma(E)/E \\\\end{cases} is the symbolic exponentiation with the difference \\\\sigma-1\\\\in\\\\Z[ G], and the second endomorphism :\\\\begin{cases} N: U\\\\to U  E\\\\mapsto E^{T_G}:=\\\\prod_{i=0}^{\\\\ell-1}\\\\sigma^i(E) \\\\end{cases} is the algebraic norm mapping, that is the symbolic exponentiation with the trace :T_G=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\ell-1}\\\\sigma^i\\\\in\\\\Z[G]. In fact, the image of the algebraic norm map is contained in the unit group U_K of the base field and N(E)= \\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(E) coincides with the usual arithmetic (field) norm as the product of all conjugates. The composita of the endomorphisms satisfy the relations \\\\Delta\\\\circ N=1 and N\\\\circ\\\\Delta=1. Two important cohomology groups can be defined by means of the kernels and images of these endomorphisms. The zeroth Tate cohomology group of G in U_L is given by the quotient H^0(G,U_L):=\\\\ker(\\\\Delta)/\\\\mathrm{im}(N)= U_K/\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(U_L) consisting of the norm residues of U_K, and the minus first Tate cohomology group of G in U_L is given by the quotient H^{-1}(G,U_L):=\\\\ker(N)/\\\\mathrm{im}(\\\\Delta)=E_{L/K}/U_L^{\\\\sigma-1} of the group E_{L/K}=\\\\\\\\{ E\\\\in U_L N(E)=1\\\\\\\\} of relative units of L/K modulo the subgroup of symbolic powers of units with formal exponent \\\\sigma-1. In his Theorem 92 Hilbert proves the existence of a relative unit H\\\\in E_{L/K} which cannot be expressed as H=\\\\sigma(E)/E, for any unit E\\\\in U_L, which means that the minus first cohomology group H^{-1}(G,U_L)=E_{L/K}/U_L^{\\\\sigma-1} is non-trivial of order divisible by \\\\ell. However, with the aid of a completely similar construction, the minus first cohomology group H^{-1}(G,L^{\\\\times})=\\\\\\\\{ A\\\\in L^{\\\\times} N(A)=1\\\\\\\\}/ (L^{\\\\times})^{\\\\sigma-1} of the G-module L^{\\\\times}=L\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{ 0\\\\\\\\}, the multiplicative group of the superfield L, can be defined, and Hilbert shows its triviality H^{-1}(G,L^{\\\\times})=1 in his famous Theorem 90. Eventually, Hilbert is in the position to state his celebrated Theorem 94: If L/K is a cyclic extension of number fields of odd prime degree \\\\ell with trivial relative discriminant \\\\mathfrak{d}_{L/K}=\\\\mathcal{O}_K, which means it's unramified at finite primes, then there exists a non-principal ideal \\\\mathfrak{j}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}_K\\\\setminus\\\\mathcal{P}_K of the base field K which becomes principal in the extension field L, that is \\\\mathfrak{j}\\\\mathcal{O}_L=A\\\\mathcal{O}_L\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}_L for some A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_L. Furthermore, the \\\\ellth power of this non-principal ideal is principal in the base field K, in particular \\\\mathfrak{j}^{\\\\ell}=\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(A)\\\\mathcal{O}_K\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}_K, hence the class number of the base field must be divisible by \\\\ell and the extension field L can be called a class field of K. The proof goes as follows: Theorem 92 says there exists unit H\\\\in E_{L/K}\\\\setminus U_L^{\\\\sigma-1}, then Theorem 90 ensures the existence of a (necessarily non-unit) A\\\\in L^{\\\\times} such that H=A^{\\\\sigma-1}, i. e., A^{\\\\sigma}=A\\\\cdot H. By multiplying A by proper integer if necessary we may assume that A is an algebraic integer. The non-unit A is generator of an ambiguous principal ideal of L/K, since (A\\\\mathcal{O}_L)^{\\\\sigma}=A^{\\\\sigma}\\\\mathcal{O}_L=A\\\\cdot H\\\\mathcal{O}_L=A\\\\mathcal{O}_L. However, the underlying ideal \\\\mathfrak{j}:=(A\\\\mathcal{O}_L)\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{O}_K of the subfield K cannot be principal. Assume to the contrary that \\\\mathfrak{j}=\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{O}_K for some \\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_K. Since L/K is unramified, every ambiguous ideal \\\\mathfrak{a} of \\\\mathcal{O}_L is a lift of some ideal in \\\\mathcal{O}_K, in particular \\\\mathfrak{a}=(\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{O}_K)\\\\mathcal{O}_L. Hence \\\\beta\\\\mathcal{O}_L=\\\\mathfrak{j}\\\\mathcal{O}_L=A\\\\mathcal{O}_L and thus A=\\\\beta E for some unit E\\\\in U_L. This would imply the contradiction H=A^{\\\\sigma-1}=(\\\\beta E)^{\\\\sigma-1}=E^{\\\\sigma-1} because \\\\beta^{\\\\sigma-1}=1. On the other hand, :\\\\mathfrak{j}^{\\\\ell}\\\\mathcal{O}_L= (\\\\mathfrak{j}\\\\mathcal{O}_L)^{\\\\ell} =\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K} (\\\\mathfrak{j}\\\\mathcal{O}_L) \\\\mathcal{O}_L= \\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(A\\\\mathcal{O}_L)\\\\mathcal{O}_L=\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(A)\\\\mathcal{O}_L, thus \\\\mathfrak{j}^{\\\\ell}=\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(A)\\\\mathcal{O}_K is principal in the base field K already. Theorems 92 and 94 don't hold as stated for \\\\ell=2, with the fields K=\\\\Q(\\\\sqrt{3}) and L=K(i) being a counterexample (in this particular case L is the narrow Hilbert class field of K). The reason is Hilbert only considers ramification at finite primes but not at infinite primes (we say that a real infinite prime of K ramifies in L if there exists non-real extension of this prime to L). This doesn't make a difference when [L:K] is odd since the extension is then unramified at infinite primes. However he notes that Theorems 92 and 94 hold for \\\\ell=2 provided we further assume that number of fields conjugate to L that are real is twice the number of real fields conjugate to K. This condition is equivalent to L/K being unramified at infinite primes, so Theorem 94 holds for all primes \\\\ell if we assume that L/K is unramified everywhere. Theorem 94 implies the simple inequality \\\\\\\\#\\\\ker(j_{L/K})\\\\ge\\\\ell=[L:K] for the order of the principalization kernel of the extension L/K. However an exact formula for the order of this kernel can be derived for cyclic unramified (including infinite primes) extension (not necessarily of prime degree) by means of the Herbrand quotient h(G,U_L) of the G-module U_L, which is given by :h(G,U_L):=\\\\\\\\#H^{-1}(G,U_L)/\\\\\\\\#H^0(G,U_L)=(\\\\ker(N):\\\\mathrm{im}(\\\\Delta))/(\\\\ker(\\\\Delta):\\\\mathrm{im}(N))=(E_{L/K}:U_L^{\\\\sigma-1})/(U_K:\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(U_L)). It can be shown that h(G,U_L)=[ L:K] (without calculating the order of either of the cohomology groups). Since the extension L/K is unramified, it's \\\\mathcal{I}^G_L=\\\\mathcal{I}_K\\\\mathcal{O}_L so \\\\mathcal{P}^G_L =\\\\mathcal{P}_L \\\\cap\\\\mathcal{I}_K\\\\mathcal{O}_L . With the aid of K. Iwasawa's isomorphism H^1(G,U_L)\\\\cong\\\\mathcal{P}^G_L/\\\\mathcal{P}_K\\\\mathcal{O}_L, specialized to a cyclic extension with periodic cohomology of length 2, we obtain :\\\\begin{align} \\\\\\\\#\\\\ker(j_{L/K})&=\\\\\\\\#(\\\\mathcal{P}_L\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{I}_K\\\\mathcal{O}_L/\\\\mathcal{P}_K\\\\mathcal{O}_L)= \\\\\\\\#(\\\\mathcal{P}^G_L /\\\\mathcal{P}_K \\\\mathcal{O}_L) =\\\\\\\\#H^1(G,U_L)=\\\\\\\\#H^{-1}(G,U_L)  &=h(G,U_L)\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\#H^0(G,U_L)=[ L:K]\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\#H^0(G,U_L)= [L:K]\\\\cdot (U_K:\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(U_L)) \\\\end{align} This relation increases the lower bound by the factor (U_K:\\\\mathrm{N}_{L/K}(U_L)), the so-called unit norm index. History As mentioned in the lead section, several investigators tried to generalize the Hilbert-Artin-Furtw√§ngler principal ideal theorem of 1930 to questions concerning the principalization in intermediate extensions between the base field and its Hilbert class field. On the one hand, they established general theorems on the principalization over arbitrary number fields, such as Ph. Furtw√§ngler 1932, O. Taussky 1932, O. Taussky 1970, and H. Kisilevsky 1970. On the other hand, they searched for concrete numerical examples of principalization in unramified cyclic extensions of particular kinds of base fields. =Quadratic fields= The principalization of 3-classes of imaginary quadratic fields K=\\\\Q(\\\\sqrt{d}) with 3-class rank two in unramified cyclic cubic extensions was calculated manually for three discriminants d\\\\in\\\\\\\\{ -3299,-4027,-9748\\\\\\\\} by A. Scholz and O. Taussky in 1934. Since these calculations require composition of binary quadratic forms and explicit knowledge of fundamental systems of units in cubic number fields, which was a very difficult task in 1934, the investigations stayed at rest for half a century until F.-P. Heider and B. Schmithals employed the CDC Cyber 76 computer at the University of Cologne to extend the information concerning principalization to the range -2\\\\cdot 10^4 < d < 10^5 containing 27 relevant discriminants in 1982, thereby providing the first analysis of five real quadratic fields. Two years later, J. R. Brink computed the principalization types of 66 complex quadratic fields. Currently, the most extensive computation of principalization data for all 4596 quadratic fields with discriminants -10^6 < d < 10^7 and 3-class group of type (3,3) is due to D. C. Mayer in 2010, who used his recently discovered connection between transfer kernels and transfer targets for the design of a new principalization algorithm. The 2-principalization in unramified quadratic extensions of imaginary quadratic fields with 2-class group of type (2,2) was studied by H. Kisilevsky in 1976. Similar investigations of real quadratic fields were carried out by E. Benjamin and C. Snyder in 1995. =Cubic fields= The 2-principalization in unramified quadratic extensions of cyclic cubic fields with 2-class group of type (2,2) was investigated by A. Derhem in 1988. Seven years later, M. Ayadi studied the 3-principalization in unramified cyclic cubic extensions of cyclic cubic fields K\\\\subset\\\\Q(\\\\zeta_f), \\\\zeta_f^f=1, with 3-class group of type (3,3) and conductor f divisible by two or three primes. =Sextic fields= In 1992, M. C. Ismaili investigated the 3-principalization in unramified cyclic cubic extensions of the normal closure of pure cubic fields K=\\\\Q(\\\\sqrt[3]{D}), in the case that this sextic number field N=K(\\\\zeta_3), \\\\zeta_3^3=1, has a 3-class group of type (3,3). =Quartic fields= In 1993, A. Azizi studied the 2-principalization in unramified quadratic extensions of biquadratic fields of Dirichlet type K=\\\\Q(\\\\sqrt{d},\\\\sqrt{-1}) with 2-class group of type (2,2). Most recently, in 2014, A. Zekhnini extended the investigations to Dirichlet fields with 2-class group of type (2,2,2), thus providing the first examples of 2-principalization in the two layers of unramified quadratic and biquadratic extensions of quartic fields with class groups of 2-rank three.

Jaulent 1988 and by K. Miyake 1989.

In contrast to the representative agent approach that dominated the field of macroeconomics till the early 1990s and argued that heterogeneity has no impact on macroeconomic activity, the model demonstrates that in the presence of capital markets imperfections and local non-convexities in the production of human capital, income distribution affects the long run level of income per-capita as well as the growth process. The model was developed by Oded Galor and Joseph Zeira in 1988, and it was published in the paper ‚ÄúIncome Distribution and Macroeconomics‚Äù, 1993. Thesis In contrast to the Neoclassical paradigm and the representative agent approach that denied the role of inequality in the growth process, novel theories that emerged in the late 1980s and empirical studies of these theories have established that income distribution has a significant impact on the process of development. The modern perspective, originated by Galor and Zeira (1988, 1993), has underscored the role of heterogeneity in the determination of macroeconomic activity, and has demonstrated that income distribution is an important determinants of the growth process and the evolution of income per capita. In particular, Galor and Zeira have argued that since credit markets are imperfect, inequality has an enduring impact on human capital formation, the level of income per capita, and the growth process. In contrast to the classical paradigm, which underlined the positive implications of inequality for capital formation and economic growth, Galor and Zeira‚Äôs hypothesis suggests that inequality has an adverse effect on human capital formation and economic development, in all but the very poor economies. The Galor-Zeira model suggests that the impact of inequality on the growth process, is governed by the effect of unequal access to education, due to imperfect capital markets, on human capital formation and economic growth. The initial distribution of income determines whether an economy converges to a low-education, low-income steady-state equilibrium, or high-income, high education steady-state equilibrium. In particular, the model predicts that inequality have an adverse effect on human capital formation and economic growth in all but the very poor economies.  Testable Predictions  The Galor and Zeira‚Äôs model predicts that the effect of rising inequality on GDP per capita is negative in relatively rich countries but positive in poor countries. These testable predictions have been examined and confirmed empirically in recent studies. In particular, Br√ºckner and Lederman test the prediction of the model by in the panel of countries during the period 1970-2010, by considering the impact of the interaction between the level of income inequality and the initial level of GDP per capita. In line with the predictions of the model, they find that at the 25th percentile of initial income in the world sample, a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient increases income per capita by 2.3%, whereas at the 75th percentile of initial income a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient decreases income per capita by -5.3%. Moreover, the proposed human capital mechanism that mediate the effect of inequality on growth in the Galor-Zeira model is also confirmed. Increases in income inequality increase human capital in poor countries but reduce it in high and middle-income countries. This recent support for the predictions of the Galor-Zeira model is in line with earlier and recent findings. Roberto Perotti showed that in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, developed by Galor and Zeira, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, while lower level of human capital is associated with lower levels of economic growth. Roland Benabou's finds that the growth process of Korea and the Philippines \\"are broadly consistent with the credit-constrained human- capital accumulation hypothesis.\\" In addition, a recent study by Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry suggests that inequality seems to affect growth through human capital accumulation and fertility channels. Model & Implications = The Structure of the Model = * Aggregate output is produced in two sectors: # Skilled-intensive and unskilled-intensive production processes. # Skilled (educated) workers are more productive than unskilled (uneducated) workers. * Individuals: # Live two periods. # Identical in abilities and preferences. # Differ in parental wealth. * Individuals‚Äô occupational choices: # First period of life: invest in human capital or work as an unskilled worker. # Second period of life: work as skilled or unskilled worker (based on decision in the first period). * Imperfect capital markets: Interest for borrowers is higher than that for lenders (due to monitoring cost). * Fixed cost associated with investment in education, reflecting: # Indivisibility of academic degrees. # Differential return to college graduate vs college dropout. = Short-run Implications = Decision to invest in education depends on parent wealth due to credit market imperfections. * High parental transfer relative to the cost of education reduces the cost of borrowing for education and induces individuals to invest in human capital. * Low parental transfer relative to the cost of education increases the cost of borrowing for education and dissuades individuals from investing in human capital. = Long- run Implications = The society is segmented into two dynasties (due to the fixed cost of education): * Skilled (educated) dynasty in which individuals transfer sufficient resources from generation to generation so as to justify investment in human capital. * Unskilled (uneducated) dynasty in which individuals do not transfer sufficient resources from generation to generation so as to justify investment in human capital. Inequality affects development: * In non-poor economies, inequality traps a larger fraction of society in under-investment in human capital and therefore reduces income per capita and economic growth. * In poor economies, inequality permits at least some individuals to invest in human capital (since the average level of income is low relative to the cost of education) and is therefore conducive for growth. = Policy implications = Government policy can improve the long-run equilibrium (in non-poor economy) by: * Subsidizing tuition cost. * Subsidizing college loans. * Improving financial markets (reducing the gap between the interest rate for borrowers and lenders). Significance The Review of Economic Studies named the Galor-Zeira paper (\\"Income Distribution and Macroeconomics\\") among the 11 most path-breaking papers published in The Review of Economic Studies in the past 60 years.

They attacked English settlements on the coast of present-day Maine between Berwick and St. Georges (Thomaston, Maine), within two months there were 11 raids - every town on the frontier had been attacked. Casco (also known as Falmouth and Portland) was the principal settlement. Background After the two attacks on Annapolis Royal in 1744, Governor William Shirley put a bounty on the Passamaquoddy, Mi‚Äôkmaq and Maliseet on Oct 20. The following year, during the Campaign, on August 23, 1745, Shirley declared war against the rest of the Wabanaki Confederacy ‚Äì the Penobscot and Kennebec tribes. In response to the New England expedition against Louisbourg which finished in June 1745, the Wabanaki retaliated by attacking the New England border. New England braced itself for such an attack by appointing a provisional force of 450 to defend the frontier. After the attacks began they increased the number of soldiers by 175 men. Massachusetts established forts along the border with Acadia: Fort George at Brunswick (1715),Fort George replaced Fort Andros which was built during King William's War (1688). St. George's Fort at Thomaston (1720), and Fort Richmond (1721) at Richmond. Fort Frederick was established at Pemaquid (Bristol, Maine).

Haridra Ganapati is also known as Ratri Ganapati. Haridra Ganapati is depicted as yellow like turmeric and wears yellow garments. He is one of the most popular thirty-two forms of Ganesha. Iconography The iconographical treatises Niyotsava and the Mantra-maharnava have similar descriptions of Haridra Ganapati. He is described as having three eyes. He sits on a golden throne. He is yellow-complexioned like turmeric and also wears yellow clothes. He has four arms and carries a pasha (noose), an ankusha (elephant goad), a modaka (sweet) and the danta (his own broken tusk) in his four hands.Yadav pp. 23‚Äì4 He draws his devotees closer by the noose, while goads them in the right direction by the ankusha. The Dakshinamnaya mentions that Haridra Ganapati has six arms and sits on a jewelled throne, in addition to his yellow colour and yellow vestments. His three right hands hold the ankusha and display the krodha-mudra (the gesture of anger) and abhayamudra (the gesture of protection). His left hands carry the pasha, a parashu (battle-axe) and displays the varadamudra (gesture of boon-giving). Other references to the deity describe his face to be ointed with turmeric; him wearing a yellow yagnopavita (\\"sacred thread\\") besides his turmeric complexion and clothes. He is described holding a pasha, an ankusha and a staff. In the AjitƒÅgama, Haridra Ganapati is described as turmeric-colored and flanked by two unnamed wives.AjitƒÅgama Vol. III. 55.18. Worship Haridra Ganapati is worshipped for wealth and well-being. He is also described to protect his devotees. Haridra Ganapati is the patron of the Haridra Ganapatya sect, one of the six major schools of the Ganapatya sect, which regards Ganesha as the Supreme Being. The Haridra Ganapati followers consider him as leader of all deities including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Indra; the guru of the sage Bhrigu, the guru of gods ‚Äì Brihaspati, the serpent Shesha etc.; the one which the greatest knowledge and the one is worshipped by the deities who create the universe. Worshipping Haridra Ganapati is believed to grant moksha (emancipation). These sectarians used to brand by iron the head of Ganesha and his tusk on their palms. Haridra Ganapati is a Tantric form of Ganesha. Special mantras and yantras are used in his worship. Rituals involving his worship generally are performed to fulfill material objectives, especially gaining boons related to sexuality. He is also associated with six rituals of abhichara (uses of spells for malevolent purposes) by which the adept can cause the target to suffer delusions, be overcome with irresistible attraction or envy, or to be enslaved, paralysed or killed.Grewal pp. 122‚Äì3 Notes References * * Category:Forms of Ganesha ","title":"Haridra Ganapati"},{"id":"43103899","text":"Annie Lee Wilkerson Cooper (June 2, 1910 ‚Äì November 24, 2010) was an African- American civil rights activist in the 1965 Selma Voting Rights Movement who is best known for punching Dallas County, Alabama Sheriff Jim Clark. Life and work Annie Lee Cooper was born on June 2, 1910, as Annie Lee Wilkerson in Selma, Alabama, one of ten children of Lucy Jones and Charles Wilkerson Sr. By the seventh grade, Cooper dropped out of school, and moved to Kentucky to live with an older sister. In 1962, Cooper returned to Selma to care for her elderly mother. Appalled by the fact that although she had been a registered voter in Pennsylvania and Ohio she was unable to register to vote in Alabama, Cooper began to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. Her attempt to register to vote in 1963 resulted in her being fired from her job as a nurse at a rest home. She then worked as a clerk at the Torch Motel. In January 1965, Cooper stood in line for hours outside the Dallas County Courthouse to register to vote until Sheriff Jim Clark ordered her to vacate the premises. Clark prodded Cooper in the neck with a billy club until Cooper turned around and hit the sheriff in the jaw, knocking him down. Deputies then wrestled Cooper to the ground as Clark continued to beat her repeatedly with his club. Cooper was charged with \\"criminal provocation\\" and was escorted to the county jail, and then held for 11 hours before being allowed to leave. She spent the period of her incarceration singing spirituals. Some in the sheriff's department wanted to charge her with attempted murder. Following this incident, Cooper became a registered voter in her home state. On June 2, 2010, Annie Lee Cooper became a centenarian. Reflecting on her longevity, she stated, \\"My mother lived to be 106, so maybe I can live that long, too.\\" She died on November 24, 2010, at the Vaughan Regional Medical Center in Selma, Alabama.

The spores grow profusely under the bark of affected trees or stacked logs. The fungus causes disease and death in trees, and the spores are allergenic and cause a debilitating pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs) in humans. Taxonomy The fungus is thought to have originated in North America and was originally named Coniosporium corticale by the American mycologists Job Bicknell Ellis and Benjamin Matlack Everhart. The characteristics of the stroma, conidiophores and conidia was the basis for placing it in a new genus as Cryptostroma corticale. It is the type species. Biology Sooty bark disease causes wilting of the crown and dieback of branches. Rectangular patches of bark, and later long strips of bark, become detached from the trunk exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. It has been found that the fungus spreads more rapidly through the tree's tissues at than at , and in the former instance, more rapidly when the tree is under greater water stress. This would seem to suggest that the disease is associated with raised summer temperatures. Allergenic activity Maple bark disease, or maple bark stripper‚Äôs disease, is an uncommon condition caused by exposure to the spores of C. corticale. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The disease has been found among workers in the paper industry employed to debark, cut and chip maple logs.

The house is also known as the Charles Edmonston House, the Alston House, and the Middleton-Smith House.  Description  The house is built on the foundation ruins of Fort Mechanic that was at this location in the later part of the eighteenth century. Shipping merchant Charles Edmondston, a Scottish immigrant from the Shetland Islands, had purchased the low sandy lot in 1817. The unstable soggy land was unfit for residential construction until a sea wall was built. Charleston city officials built one in 1820 and Edmondston then started the construction of the house. The antebellum modified Charleston single house (side-hall) was constructed between 1820 and 1828. Edmondston had built the house originally in the English Regency style architecture. The front main entrance is from Charleston's historic area known as High Battery. The east facing three-story house has a panoramic view of the Charleston harbor as well as a view of the High Battery, the city's well known waterfront promenade. It is made of brick and stucco faced. The property is mostly surrounded by a wrought-iron railing fence which is built on top of a three-foot brick wall. The house has an open floor plan of basically two large rooms on each floor with smaller adjacent areas. The house has several fireplaces and the brick chimneys have terra cotta chimney pots. The low pitched slate roof is surrounded by a parapet, which hides most of it. The second story has fourteen foot ceilings. There are large window and door openings for good air flow circulation to act as a type of air-conditioner. There are outbuildings to the house that originally contained the kitchen and servants' quarters. The back part of the property originally was the horse stables and facilities for carriages.

The house has wide piazzas (porches) on the south side. The north entrance leads into a large hall. One passes through an arch into a large staircase hall. The hall goes from north to south on the lower porch leading to an outside door. The staircase at the entrance leads to the two drawing rooms on the second floor. The small rooms behind them served as withdrawing spaces, one for men and the other for women. A room of books for library use and reading are at this level. The interior walls and ceilings are finished in ornamental plaster. A balcony was destroyed in the 1886 Charleston earthquake and replaced with the present cast-iron balcony.

Edmondston had to sell the property through bankruptcy receivers because of the Panic of 1837 that caused economic setbacks for him. Alston immediately remodeled the house in the Greek Revival style and added a third story. The Alstons received their business visitors on the first floor, while their social functions they did on the second floor. Alston placed his family coat-of-arms on the parapet on the east front. This feature of a coat-of-arms being placed on a parapet on top of a house is the only known example in Charleston. Pictures taken in 1958 by Louis Schwartz, HABS Photographer in June 1958 show the interior rooms. General P.G.T. Beauregard, Confederate commander who gave the order to fire cannons on Fort Sumter that started the American Civil War, watched the bombardment from the house porch on April 12, 1861. General Robert E. Lee stayed overnight at the house later in 1861 due to a city fire, that was not related to the Civil War. The house acquired the family names of the various owners.(i.e. Charles Edmonston House, Alston House, Middleton-Smith House). The house has remained in the Alston family line since 1838. The ownership passed through the estate of Susan Pringle Alston (Charles Alston's daughter) to historian Henry Augustus Middleton Smith, Susan's favorite cousin, in 1922. Union Major General Rufus Saxton occupied the house during the Civil War in March 1865. The house, which was converted to a museum in 1973, is managed by Middleton Place Foundation. The main idea of making the house a museum was to preserve the architectural integrity and to complement nearby house museums like the Nathaniel Russell House and the Heyward-Washington House.

The castle figures prominently in Danish history. It was here that King Eric V Klipping signed Denmark's first constitution in 1282. The castle was also the venue for the Danehof, the country's first parliament. The castle is operated as a part of √òstfyns Museum (√òstfyns Museer) which also includes Borgmesterg√•rden in Mads Lerches G√•rd. History Established around 1170, the moated castle was originally square-shaped with corner towers connected by a curtain wall. A residential building (palatium) was constructed next to the west wall in the mid-13th century and a strong defensive tower was built on the east wall. It was here that King Eric V signed Denmark's first constitution in 1282. Until 1413, the palatium was the main venue for the Danehof or medieval parliament. King Christian III, who frequently stayed in the building, created a new banqueting hall and a tower in the 1540s. Under King Christian IV, additional work was performed by the Italian architect Domenicus Badiaz in 1607, when the main tower (Knudst√•rnet) received a spire similar to that of Copenhagen's Bl√•t√•rn. The castle was seriously damaged during the Dano-Swedish War (1657‚Äì58). Thereafter, most of the buildings were torn down, the stone being used from 1722 for the construction of Odense Palace. The buildings still standing were used to store grain or gunpowder. The castle was restored from 1917 to 1923 by Mogens Clemmensen. It then became a museum. Restoration The castle was in a sorry state when the garrison left Nyborg in 1913. Nevertheless, encouraged by local interest in the building, the National Museum of Denmark decided to undertake extensive restoration work under the leadership of Mogens Clemmensen. On the basis of carefully conducted archaeological investigations, the work proceeded for some 10 years but in 1925 the funding was exhausted. While most of the building had been restored, work was not completed on much of the north wing or on some of the interior details. In general, Clemmensen based his work on the state of the castle under Christian III but he also added numerous details he discovered in other sources, not always clearly documenting them. After the restoration, the rooms were fitted out with furniture acquired from various historic manor houses. There are three banqueting halls, each representing an important period in Danish history: the Danehof Room (Danehofsalen) hosted parliamentary meetings, court representatives of the Kalmar Union met in Margrethe's Hall (Margrethes riddersal) while in Christian III's Hall (Christian 3's riddersale) there is a display depicting the period when Nyborg served as the nation's capital until 1560. Located at Slotsgade 34, the castle is open to visitors from 10 am to 3 pm in April, May, September and October and every day from 10 am to 4 pm in June, July and August. √òstfyns Museum √òstfyns Museum was formed in 2009 by a merger between Kerteminde Museum and Nyborg Museum. The museum had three primary operations: Nyborg Slot including Borgmesterg√•rden, Johannes Larsen Museet and the Vikingmuseum Ladby.

In the 2011 census, Fairhaven had a population of 296 people. The village is a popular holiday destination, with many homes being used for that purpose. It adjoins Fairhaven Beach, which at 6 km long is the longest beach on the Great Ocean Road. The village is separated from adjoining Aireys Inlet by the Painkalac Creek, and development in recent years has seen Fairhaven become increasingly joined to the Aireys Inlet township. Fairhaven Beach is a popular surfing destination, and the Fairhaven Surf Lifesaving Club, which was founded in 1957, has been described as Fairhaven's \\"social centre\\". The club operated out of a volunteer-built clubhouse from 1960 until 2012, when the building was demolished to allow for the construction of a new modern one. Numerous delays saw the club operating out of shipping containers for more than a year, but a new clubhouse finally opened in December 2013. A local landmark is the Pole House, situated on a concrete column 40 metres above Fairhaven Beach. The original house, built in 1978, was demolished in 2013 after the owners thwarted a bid to list the building on the Victorian Heritage Register. In 2013‚Äì14, a house was rebuilt on the existing pole, to a modern design along similar lines. Better Homes and Gardens filmed a segment there for the opening of the replacement house in early 2014.

Life Born in London, he was the son of James Newton the engraver, and nephew of Willam Newton (1735‚Äì1790) the architect. He began his career as an engraver, and executed a few plates, including a portrait of Joseph Richardson, M.P., after Martin Archer Shee. Concentrating then on miniature-painting, he became one of the most fashionable artists of his day, and for many years his only real rival was Sir William Ross. In 1831 he was appointed miniature-painter in ordinary to William IV and Queen Adelaide, and from 1837 to 1858 held the same post under Queen Victoria. He was knighted in 1837. Though popular, Newton was never elected to the Royal Academy. He long resided in Argyll Street, London; after his retirement he moved to 6 Cambridge Terrace, Hyde Park, where he died 22 January 1869. Works Scottish Child and Dog (1839) by William John Newton Newton was a constant contributor to Royal Academy exhibitions, from 1808 to 1863. He found a method for joining several pieces of ivory to form a large surface, and was then able to paint some larger groups. Three of these were: The Coronation of the Queen, 1838; The Marriage of the Queen, 1840; and The Christening of the Prince of Wales, 1842. Many of Newton's portraits were engraved, including those of Stephen Lushington, Joanna Baillie, Sir Herbert Taylor, Joseph Hume, Lady Byron, Mary Ann Paton, and Lady Sophia Gresley. Some drawings by Newton, among them a self-portrait, went to the print room of the British Museum. Family Newton married in 1822 Anne, daughter of Robert Faulder; she died in 1856. Their son, Harry Robert Newton, an architect, studied under Sydney Smirke; he died in November 1889. His collection of drawings and manuscripts went to the Institute of British Architects.

It was the largest State, and the only first-class State, of the Rewa Kantha Agency.. Among Gujarat States (as distinct from Kathiawar or Saurashtra States), Rajpipla State was the second-largest after Baroda in terms of size and importance. The Gohil Rajput dynasty of Rajpipla survived the onslaught of the Sultans of Ahmedabad and the Mughals during the mediaeval period, and the Gaekwars of Baroda and the British in the modern period, to emerge as a well-administered State with contemporary infrastructure, policies and practices by the time it was merged with the Union of India on 10 June 1948. The Rajpipla princely State was situated largely between two important rivers of western India‚Äîthe Narmada and the Tapti, with the Satpura range in the south. Spanning an area of over 1500 square miles (4,000 km¬≤), of which 600 mi¬≤ (1550 km¬≤) were forests and the rest fertile agricultural plains and river valleys, Rajpipla grew to be one of the most prosperous princely states in Gujarat, second only to Baroda. It was also famous for its agate mines. It is now part of the state of Gujarat. Its capital town of Rajpipla (Nandod or New Rajpipla) is now headquarters of the Narmada district. History Chokrana, a Parmar Rajput prince, originally hailing from the ruling family of Ujjain in Malwa (now the western part of the state of Madhya Pradesh), was in the early part of the fourteenth century ruling over the principality of Rajpipla, with his capital at Dev Chhatra (Abode of the Gods) high up in the western Satpuras and deep inside the forests, overlooking the holy River Narmada. Chokrana Parmar's daughter was married to the legendary Mokhdaji, the Gohil Rajput warrior chief of Ghoga in Gohilwar, Saurashtra. Chokrana, who had no male heir, adopted his grandson Samarsinhji, younger son of Mokhdaji Gohil. Mokhdaji's first wife was a Sarviya princess of Hathasani and their son Dungarsinhji succeeded as chief of Ghoga, part of which later became the princely state of Bhavnagar. Samarsinhji acceded to the gadi (throne) of Rajpipla around 1340, assuming the name Arjunsinhji. From then, Rajpipla was ruled by the Gohil Rajput dynasty. The Kul Devi (family deity) of the royal family of Rajpipla is Shri Harsiddhi Mataji, the original temple being in Ujjain. It is said that Maharana Verisalji I of Rajpipla built the temple of Harsiddhi Mataji at Rajpipla in the 18th century. =Gohil Rajput dynasty and clan= The origin of the Gohil Rajput clan goes back to the sixth century AD when Muhideosur Gohadit or Guhil, born in 542 A.D. after the sack of Vallabhi and the only male survivor of the clan, went on to become chief of an area near modern Idar in Gujarat in the year 556 A.D, and held sway till his death in 603 A.D. His descendant Kalbhoj or Bappa Rawal seized Chittor and became ruler of Mewar in 734 A.D. A little more than centuries later in 973 A.D., Salivahan, the Gohil ruler of Mewar, and 11th in descent to Bappa Rawal, moved away with part of the clan from Chittor to Juna Khergarh (present-day Bhalotra near Jodhpur) on the River Luni in Marwar, leaving behind his son Shaktikumar with the remaining members of his kin. There is still a village there called 'Gohilon ki dhani'. Thus for about two-and-a-half centuries, both Mewar and Marwar were ruled by the Gohil Rajput dynasty. Later, after Alauddin Khalji ravaged Chittor in 1303, the Gohils of Mewar regrouped and assumed the name Sisodia. The capital was shifted from Chittor to Udaipur in 1559. Meanwhile, the Gohils who had migrated under Salivahan continued to rule over Marwar. After the formation of the Delhi Sultanate in the early part of the thirteenth century the Rathore clan, pushed out of Kannauj, travelled to Marwar. There were fierce clashes between the Gohils and Rathores in Marwar, which resulted in the death of the respective chiefs Maheshdasji Gohil and Siyaji Rathore. The Gohil clan, under their chief Sejakji, then marched back to Saurashtra, after five centuries, where they became governors of the Solankis, a branch of the Chalukyas. Soon, they carved out their own principalities. The most famous of their chiefs during this period were Sejakji, Ranoji and Mokhdaji, and the princely States their descendants carved out were Bhavnagar State, Rajpipla State, Palitana State, Lathi, and Vallabhipur or Vala State. Those were turbulent medieval times and it was not easy for the Gohils to retain their hold over Rajpipla. They had to face several invasions from the sultans of Ahmedabad, the Mughal emperors and later the Marathas, even losing their principality for brief periods, each time coming back to power by joining forces with the hill tribes (mostly Bhils) and carrying out guerrilla attacks. In 1730, with the weakening of the Mughal Empire, the 26th Gohil ruler of Rajpipla, Maharana Verisalji I stopped paying tribute to the Mughals, and his son Maharana Jeetsinhji wrested back Nandod taluka and shifted the capital from Junaraj up in the Satpuras to Nandod or new Rajpipla town, in the plains on the banks of the river Karjan, a tributary of the Narmada. When the Marathas grew powerful in the 18th century, the Gaekwars of Baroda State exacted tribute from Rajpipla. The stranglehold of the Gaekwars was cast aside with the intervention of the British, and accession of the 33rd Gohil ruler Maharana Verisalji II on the gadi of Rajpipla. During the 1857 Mutiny, Rajpipla under Verisalji II rebelled, and for many months relieved itself of the sway of the British. It was not surprising, therefore, that the agitated English, having quelled the Mutiny and transferred power to the Crown, forced Verisalji II to step aside and make way for his son Maharana Gambhirsinhji in 1860 AD.Ras-Mala by Alexander Kinloch Forbes, 1856 =1900s and Maharaja Vijaysinhji= The golden period of Rajpipla during the modern era began when Maharana Gambhirsinhji's son, Maharana Chhatrasinhji, the 35th Gohil ruler of Rajpipla came to the gadi in 1897 A.D. Rajpipla witnessed rapid progress over the next half-century. Knighthood was conferred on Maharana Chhatrasinhji (KCIE) as a result of his efficient administration. This included laying of the 60-mile (90 kilometres) railway line connecting Rajpipla to Ankleshwar on the main Delhi-Ahmedabad- Bombay line, initiated in the first year of his reign, and massive famine relief during the period 1899-1902. Maharana Chhatrasinhji was one of the pioneers of motoring in India, owning cars like the Wolseley 6 hp 1903-04, Armstrong Siddeley 15 hp 1906 and Clement Bayard 16 hp.The Ruling Princes and Chiefs of India published by The Times of India, 1930 But the builder of contemporary, affluent Rajpipla was his son, Maharana Vijaysinhji, who ascended the gadi in 1915 A.D. Educated at Rajkumar College, Rajkot and a member of the Imperial Cadet Corp, Dehra Dun, Maharana Vijaysinhji proved to be a great administrator, assisted by his karbhari Rasikbhai Dubla. Knighthood was conferred on Maharaja Vijaysinhji (KCSI), and he received the hereditary title of Maharaja. The gun salute for the ruler of Rajpipla was raised from 11 to 13. During World War I Rajpipla State supplied many recruits. In recognition of his services Maharaja Vijaysinhji received the honorary rank of Captain in the British Army. Maharaja Sir Vijaysinhji built a huge, exquisitely-designed high school where only nominal fees were charged, and introduced free primary education and scholarships. He constructed a civil hospital, maternity hospital, five dispensaries and a veterinary hospital in the State. A criminal-and-civil court was established, pensions were paid to public servants, and the salaries of the police and military were increased. Maharaja Vijaysinhji ordered the laying of extensive public works and good motorable roads. He added the 40-mile (64 kilometres) Jhagadia-Netrang section to Rajpipla State Railway established during his father's reign. He also set up a 19-mile (31 kilometres) steam railroad and tramway connecting the towns along the river Narmada with villages in the interior, and a power house supplying electricity and water to Rajpipla town. His town planning in 1927 was far-sighted, and builders were given permission to construct, conditional to leaving 3 to 4 feet (about 1 metre) space for future widening of roads. The designs of new buildings were well integrated and in harmony with the surroundings.Coronation Supplement to The Illustrated Weekly of India, 9 May 1937 Even though taxes were reduced in terms of percentage, the revenue of the State increased from Rupees 1,300,000 (Rupees 13 lakhs) to Rupees 2,700,000 (Rupees 27 lakhs) per annum in the period 1915-1930, and rose to Rupees 5,072,613 (nearly Rupees 51 lakhs) in 1945-46, which was the basic year for calculation of privy purse when the State was merged with the Indian Union later in 1948. Maharaja Vijaysinhji regularised the land revenue system, and his relief efforts during droughts and floods drew wide appreciation. With a keen interest in agriculture, he improved the quality of cotton by introducing long-staple cotton known as \\"1027 A.I.F\\" in 1919-20 which increased the income of farmers manifold, and also grains and fruits grown in his territory. Sports were Maharaja Vijaysinhji's passion. He was a keen horseman and maintained one of the finest stables of race horses in India and England, marked by quality and not quantity. Maharaja Vijaysinhji won the first Indian Derby in 1919 when his horse Tipster led the pack at the finish. His horse Embargo won the Irish Derby in 1926 and Grand Prix in Belgium in 1927. Other horses, like Melesigenes, won him nearly all the big prizes in races at Bombay, Poona and other Indian courses, and in 1932-33 he topped the racing events in India. But, doubtlessly, his best horse was Windsor Lad, that won the coveted Epsom Derby of England in 1934. Maharaja Vijaysinhji is still the only Indian owner to have won the English Derby, considered the greatest horse race in the world, cheered on by an estimated quarter to half a million people on the course that day. King George V and Queen Mary of Britain, who watched the race along with other members of the Royal Family, invited Maharaja Vijaysinhji to the Royal Box and felicitated him on this brilliant victory. In the process the Maharaja completed a brilliant hat-trick of Derby wins: the first-ever Indian Derby, the Irish Derby and the coveted Epsom Derby of England, making him arguably the greatest Indian racehorse owner.Pageant of Life by Lowell Thomas, 1941 After his brilliant victory in the Epsom Derby, Maharaja Vijaysinhji began construction of what became one of the finest palaces of 20th century India, the magnificent Indrajit-Padmini Mahal, also known as Vadia Palace. Built in predominantly Indo-Saracenic style with a few western features, using the finest Italian marble and Burma teak, the exquisite largely centrally air-conditioned Art Deco palace has two huge wooden spiral staircases and 1,000 doors and windows, and beautiful frescoes in various themes on the walls and ceiling. Completed in 1939, this marvel of architecture came to be dubbed as 'The Taj of Gujarat'. Maharaja Vijaysinhji spent much of the summer sporting season in England, and returned to India in the winter when he encouraged outdoor sports like cricket, football and hockey. Sports were made compulsory for students of Rajpipla State. He equipped Rajpipla with a polo ground and gymkhana club. A unique feature of the Rajpipla royal family was its polo team comprising Maharaja Vijaysinhji and his three sons (then) Yuvraj Rajendrasinhji, Maharajkumar Pramodsinhji and Maharajkumar Indrajitsinhji. Having a passion for cars like his father, Maharaja Vijaysinhji owned twelve Rolls-Royce cars, from the Silver Ghost 1913 to the Phantom III 1937, which were based at his palaces in Rajpipla, and stately homes in Bombay and Windsor. In his garages could be found several makes and models of the finest cars.Racing with the Gods by Marcus Marsh, 1968 Having already gifted an aircraft to the Imperial Aircraft Flotilla during the First World War, Maharaja Vijaysinhji donated three Spitfire fighter planes, named 'Rajpipla', 'Windsor Lad' and 'Embargo', and a Hawker Hurricane aircraft 'Rajpipla II' when the Second World War was at its zenith. He was awarded the Knight Grand Cross (GBE). Maharaja Vijaysinhji built an aerodrome in Rajpipla on a 125-acre site on the banks of the River Karjan in the late 1920s. This became defunct since merger of Rajpipla State with the Union of India in 1948. But after the building of the Statue of Unity in close proximity to Rajpipla, Government of Gujarat decided to revive this in 2018, and build a new Rajpipla airport there. The Maharaja also had surveys carried out to build four dams across the Narmada, and also the Karjan, at places where both banks of the rivers fell in Rajpipla territory, to facilitate irrigation and generate electricity, and was in the process of raising investment for them. These were precursors to the present-day gigantic Sardar Sarovar project and Karjan dam. Seeing the early signs of the winds of change, Maharaja Vijaysinhji formed a legislative assembly in Rajpipla State, which was inaugurated on 10 December 1932, the 17th anniversary of his formal accession to the gadi (or throne) of Rajpipla. He gave a fillip in Rajpipla in the 1940s, to the movement for 'responsible government' which was taking shape in the Indian princely States alongside the freedom movement in British India. After independence of India in 1947, when it came to talks regarding the accession of princely States to the Union of India, the Ministry of States under Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel decided that talks with the rulers of Gujarat States would not be held at the Bombay Secretariat. Instead the Ministry requested Maharaja Vijaysinhji to convene the meetings at his own residence 'Palm Beach' at Nepeansea Road, Bombay. There were discussions under the chairmanship of Maharaja Vijaysinhji for three days, which went on till late at night. At the end of it, Maharaja Vijaysinhji read out the following statement: \\"We have the pleasure to inform you that, as rulers of Gujarat States, we believe our Mother Country and particularly Gujarat looks up to us to make all sacrifices in the wider interests of India as a whole. We, therefore, have cheerfully responded to the call of duty and decided to take the first step in forming the province of Maha Gujarat by integrating our States with the province of Bombay. We invoke God's blessings on our decision.\\" Maharaja Vijaysinhji, thus, readily handed over to the forces of Indian democracy, his beloved Rajpipla State that he had nurtured for nearly 33 years, along with Rupees 2,800,000 (Rs. 2.8 million or Rupees 28 lakhs) that were deposited in the State treasury. With the population around 3,00,000 inhabitants, the State was merged with the Indian Union on 10 June 1948, bringing to an end the 600-year rule of the Gohil Rajput dynasty over Rajpipla. Maharaja Vijaysinhji passed away at his estate 'The Manor' at Old Windsor in England in April 1951, and was cremated at Rampura on the banks of the holy river Narmada, 18 kilometres from his former capital amid a huge gathering of the people of Rajpipla.A Maharaja's Turf by Indra Vikram Singh, 2011 =Rajpipla after 1971= The title of Maharaja of Rajpipla passed on to Maharaja Vijaysinhji's eldest son Rajendrasinhji, and after his demise in 1963 to Raghubir Singh. The Indian princely order was finally abolished in 1971. Raghubir Singh's only son Manvendra Singh Gohil caused a stir in 2006 when he openly declared in the media that he is a homosexual. Raghubir Singh has a daughter Minaxi who married Digvijay Chand of Chenani in 1992. They have a son Ranajay Chand and a daughter, Dharini.Chenani Maharaja Vijaysinhji's second son Maharajkumar Pramodsinhji joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and served in the Orissa cadre. He had four daughters Yogeshwari, Maheshwari, Durgeshwari and Krishna. Maharaja Vijaysinhji's third son Maharajkumar Indrajitsinhji was one of India's finest polo players in the 1950s and a gifted artist whose paintings still adorn the walls of Mayo College, Ajmer. Maharajkumar Indrajitsinhji's two sons are Indra Vikram Singh and Indra Vadan Singh. Indra Vikram Singh is a well-known writer and publisher, and has authored ten books, nine of them on the game of cricket, and one entitled 'A Maharaja's Turf' on the triumph of his grandfather Maharaja Vijaysinhji in the Epsom Derby of 1934. Among his other books are several on the cricket World Cup, and 'Don's Century' which is a biography of the legendary Sir Donald Bradman and also a panorama of batting from the 1860s till the present times. Indra Vadan Singh has inherited his father's artistic talents, and runs his own tea blending, marketing and export business. The well known cricketer K.S. Duleepsinhji, nephew of the famous H.H. Maharaja Jam Saheb K.S. Ranjitsinhji of Nawanagar or Ranji, married Maharaja Vijaysinhji's cousin Rajkumari Jayaraj Kunverba of Rajpipla. The major part of the erstwhile princely state of Rajpipla now forms the Narmada district in Gujarat, with Rajpipla town as its headquarters, while some portions fall in Vadodara and Bharuch districts.

He is known for a bust that he made of Napoleon and a statue of a French Dragoon on the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. Early years Charles Louis Corbet was born in 1758 in Douai, and baptized in the parish of Saint-Pierre on 27 January 1758. His mother was not married. He studied in Douai, than in Paris in the studio of the sculptor Pierre-Fran√ßois Berruer. He won a medal from the Acad√©mie Royal. In 1780, when he was twenty-two, he had moved to Lille, where he was accepted by the Academy on the presentation of one of his modeled works. He was definitely named an Academician after he completed the Mort de M√©l√©agre. Between 1782 and 1790 he made many bas-relief portraits and busts, often in terracotta. In 1790 he made a terracotta bust of Louis XVI. French Revolution Corbet was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, which began in 1789. Corbet was made librarian of the √âcole Centrale in October 1793, and held this position for at least five years. He was commissioned to create a statue representing Liberty, and completed a plaster model in September 1794. He asked for three years to complete a marble statue. This work was never started. In the year IV he was sent on a mission to Belgium by the representative Briet, for a purpose that is not known. There are few records of works of art created by Corbet in the period from 1793 to 1799. Later years Corbet was given a commission by the government to execute a bust of the young general Bonaparte. The first plaster model, high, was exhibited in the Salon of July 1798, with the inscription \\"... fait d'apr√®s nature\\". The sittings must have taken place between 5 December 1797, when Bonaparte returned from Italy, and 4 May 1798 when he left for Egypt. The bust portrays Napoleon as a handsome and heroic figure. At the Salon of 1800 Corbet presented a marble version of the bust of General Bonaparte, executed on the orders of the Directory during the Egyptian campaign. Signed plaster copies with dates from Year VI (1797) to Year VIII (1800) are held in the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison, Palace of Versailles, Carnavalet Museum, Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e, Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille, and Mus√©e Mass√©na in Nice. Bronze casts were made, and marble copies were created in the Second French Empire. Having moved permanently to Paris, in 1801 Corbet exhibited a huge bust of the French Republic, which earned him an honorable mention. Two years later he completed a marble copy of the bust of Napoleon, now the First Consul, which earned much acclaim. This version of the bust was more polished but had less life than the original. He was charged with creating the statue of a French dragoon for the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, and a statue of general Caffarelli for the Senate stairway, which was exhibited in the Salon of 1806 along with a bust of General B√©raud, also commissioned by the government. Corbet died in 1808. He was unmarried, and left no children.

Early life  Joan Calabrese, born on October 29, 1939, was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\"Joan Calabrese\\", moncheri.com, 2014 Joan displayed a love for fashion from a very early age when she began designing and sewing clothes for her dolls. Calabrese once noted, \\"my mother said as soon as I could hold a pencil I was drawing costumes and people.\\" She studied fashion illustration at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and was offered a full scholarship which she declined in order to work with family. She began styling children's clothing when she first made dresses for her two daughters, Marisa Moore and Elena Calabrese. As she made these dresses, her cousin, Tom Marotta, who was at that time Vice President of Saks Fifth Avenue's couture department, was intrigued by her designs and had Joan introduce her dresses to the store. This Children's Boutique owned by Linda Berman started to buy her self-sewn dresses, which started off her career. For the first couple of years of sewing dresses, she only worked on them herself, but as her children's dresses got introduced into her boutiques she began to hire seamstress. As she began to become more known, her dresses were now in Cerutti's on Madison Avenue, New York. After this well-known store bought her clothing, more and more companies wanted her dresses, which led to her name getting out there. She was one of the few stylist for high style clothing for children. Calabrese also made women's handbags, but was more inspired to do children's clothing and continued on with couture for kids.  Work  For many years she worked under her own label, Joan Calabrese INC. She bought her own fabrics from Paris, Europe, where she traveled twice a year. Her office was primarily in the basement of her house in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. Many people in the high end world scheduled to meet with her in order to get specialized dresses for their children. When she first started creating these unique dresses she made about 2500 dresses a year by herself.  Career  Her early designs were very expensive, costing up to $400 in 1982, mainly due to her focus on the best fabrics from Europe. She described how she tried to individualize her materials and make her pieces unique and special.Marantz, Paula. Interview with Joan Calabrese, DUTV's The Drexel InterView, Drexel University, 27 June 2006. Retrieved on 20 June 2006. In an interview with Drexel University, Joan said many of her customers considered the gowns a family heirloom to be passed from generation to generation. Pieces of Calabrese's clothing are held in the permanent collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, who accepted two of Joan's dresses for the Permanent Collection of their Costume Institute[6]and she is also featured in the Costume Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.[7] In order to be a part of these museums, an artists' work was judged and then approved. Joan Calabrese being the designer, marketer and sales- person of her clothing, introduced her own work to the museum by calling and setting up a date to observe her work in order to consider it for these museums. Calabrese clients included Natalie Wood, members of the Kennedy family, Nancy Sinatra and Betsy Bloomingdale. Willow Smith wore her dress in the Fashion Catwalk at The Dubai Mall. When Dakota Fanning attended the 2003 Emmys, aged 9, she wore a Calabrese design on the red carpet. When Dakota Fanning wore her dress, Joan Rivers was the host and asked her who she was wearing and Dakota answered Joan Calabrese. This also got Joan more known in the fashion industry and kicked off her career even more. She also won the DEBI awardevery year and still continues to win the award even after her death due to the release of many designs by companies. = Mon Cheri = As Joan Calabrese got older, she licensed with Mon Cheri for about 10 years. Here she illustrated affordable range of flower girl and First Communion dresses. and focused mainly on flower girl wear.

It is a controversial and highly criticized term in the art community. Overview \\"Post-Internet\\" emerged from mid-2000s discussions about Internet art by Marisa Olson, Gene McHugh, and Artie Vierkant (the latter famous for his Image Objects, a series of deep blue monochrome prints). Between the 2000s and 2010s, post-Internet artists were largely the domain of millennials operating on web platforms such as Tumblr and MySpace. The movement is also responsible for spearheading slews of microgenres and subcultures such as seapunk and vaporwave. According to a 2015 article in The New Yorker, the term describes \\"the practices of artists who ... unlike those of previous generations, [employ] the Web [as] just another medium, like painting or sculpture. Their artworks move fluidly between spaces, appearing sometimes on a screen, other times in a gallery.\\" In the early 2010s, \\"post-Internet\\" was popularly associated with the musician Grimes, who used the term to describe her work at a time when post-Internet concepts were not typically discussed in mainstream music arenas.

Consulted in September 2, 2015. for Viceroy Diego L√≥pez Pacheco in Mexico City. After arriving in Santa Fe, Valdes investigated the administration of the previous city governor, Luis de Rosas, as well as the veracity of the charges that the Franciscans had issued against him (they had several confrontations with De Rosas). The investigation was made under the orders of Viceroy. Valdez acted as \\"Residence's Judge\\" to De Rosas.Dossier concerning the abuses of Luis de Rosas, governor of New Mexico. Page 3. EScholarship: University of California. After the investigation, Valdes imprisoned De Rosas, whose administration he considered harmful to the population. Initially, Valdez wanted to keep some of Luis de Rosas's companions on the Board of Santa Fe, but he changed his mind when he learned that many of the companions of De Rosas in his Board were mestizos. He would admit only people of pure Spanish ancestry in his government, so he replaced them by encomenderos. This new group was close to the Franciscans and incorporated into the town council, a very important institution in the Spanish America because it represented the population of the governed territory. It sent the population's pleas to the governor and the petitions of the inhabitants to Viceroy and to King of Spain. Occasionally, if the Viceroy thought the governor had disobeyed governmental orders, the town council could replace the governor. Moreover, it could temporarily govern a territory when a governor died without a lieutenant governor to replace him. The fatigue caused by the long journey (he had traveled over 1,500 kilometers from Mexico City to Santa Fe) made Valdes seriously ill. He appointed Sergeant Francisco Gomes lieutenant governor in order to continue the investigation of Luis de Rosas. Vald√©s died in autumn 1641 as the shortest-serving governor of New Mexico (from spring 1641 to autumn 1641). Personal life Juan Flores de Sierra had at least one son: Juan Flores de Sierra y Valdes II, who became Melchor's lieutenant in the Californian town of San Diego.Hendricks, Kick; Mandell, Gerald (Spring 2006).

Their ship, MV Nova Star, was a Ropax cruiseferry operating seasonally on the Gulf of Maine between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The company, operated as a joint venture by Quest Navigation of Eliot, Maine and Singapore conglomerate ST Marine, was awarded the contract to operate the route in November 2013, when the Nova Scotia government agreed to issue $21 million in forgivable loans to the company over seven years. The company began service on May 15, 2014. During the first summer, the company expected to carry 100,000 passengers, but had only carried 59,000 by the time it stopped operating for the season in October. As a result, the Nova Scotia government spent the entire $21 million allocated to subsidizing the service for seven years in the first season, and issued an additional $4.4 million to Nova Star in October, subject to increased financial oversight. Nova Star was initially laid up for winter 2015 in Nova Scotia, but moved south to Charleston, South Carolina in January after Nova Scotia provided $2 million to cover off-season expenses. In February, Nova Scotia officials said that the province had developed a plan to spend $13 million to subsidize Nova Star during the 2015 season, with the ferry operating between June 1 and October 14. During 2015, the company set a target of 80,000 passengers carried, though by August it was on track to miss the goal, having carried 37,800 by the end of the month, and the Nova Scotia government was working to determine whether it would contract with Nova Star again in 2016. Four companies submitted bids to Nova Scotia, with the province expected to select the 2016 operator of the route within weeks. By 2016 the MV Nova Star had moved to Europe and a new high-speed ferry line was in operation between Portland and Yarmouth.

It is developed by IEC Technical Committee 1 (Terminology), and published as both the IEC 60050 series of standards and online as the Electropedia. The Electropedia database contains English and French definitions for more than 20 000 concepts, and provides terms in up to 16 other languages.  International Electrotechnical Vocabulary ‚Äì IEV ‚Äì Electropedia  = History of the IEV = =First edition of the IEV= In 1927 agreement was reached on the system of classification into groups and sections, the system of numbering the terms and definitions, the approximate extent of the IEV and other important items. The first edition of the IEV was published in 1938 with 2000 terms and definitions in English and French, and terms in German, Italian, Spanish and Esperanto.Sample page in the review \\"Esperanto\\" Oct. 1935, p. 135. It was the outcome of patient work over 28 years. =The IEV grows and goes online: Electropedia= Since 1938, although the aim of the IEV remains unchanged ‚Äì to provide precise, brief and correct definitions of internationally accepted concepts in the field of electrotechnology, electronics and telecommunications ‚Äì the scope of the IEV has expanded in line with the expansion of the electrotechnical industry. The number of IEC technical committees is now more than 90, with almost as many subcommittees, and there are more than 20000 entries in the IEV, covering more than 80 subject areas. The terms and definitions are provided in English and French, and equivalent terms are provided in Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian (Bokm√•l and Nynorsk), Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish (coverage varies by subject area). Traditionally the IEV was developed and published as a series of International Standards, initially under the reference number IEC 50 and later renumbered as IEC 60050, with each part of the standard covering a given subject, such as circuit theory, live working and electrobiology. The online version of the IEV, known as Electropedia, was launched on 2 April 2007. =Electropedia becomes a database standard= As a collection of items managed in a database, the IEV is an ideal international standard to be managed under IEC‚Äôs database procedure. Through the use of a web-accessible database and electronic communication a validation team comprising experts appointed by and acting as delegates on behalf of their National Committees evaluate and validate requests to change the database. The change can comprise an addition or deletion, a revision (editorial or technical revision) or a simple correction, and can apply to one or many items in the database. The database procedure encompasses the comment gathering and validation stages of the traditional standards development process and allows for both a rapid procedure as well as the traditional procedure. =Future evolution= The IEC Technical Committee 1, Terminology, is currently considering whether there is interest in the IEC community to evolve the vocabulary towards an electrotechnology ontology covering electrical, electronic and related technologies.

Inspired by the sudden appearance in Poltava of a large group of Tolstoyans in 1891, according to brother Yuli Bunin. Ivan Bunin in 1893 himself fell under strong influence of Lev Tolstoy's ideas and later described himself as 'a Tolstoyan'. The story has never appeared in a magazine. It was rejected by Alexander Skabichevsky of Novoye Slovo who (in a letter dated August 27, 1896) suggested the story was 'too feullieton-like': \\",here are just several freaks, and a Tolstovian, well above them,\\" he wrote. Bunin thought Skabichevsky's opinion was \\"very spiteful and totally unjust.\\" Later, in October of the same year, the story was refused by Viktor Goltsev of Russkaya Mysl. * Velga (–í–µ–ª–≥–∞).

According to Bunin's August 1891 letter to his then partner Varvara Pashchenko, the story was inspired by his visit to brother Yevgeny's estate. Gorky praised the story's stylistic brilliance but was critical as to its ideological and aesthetical substance. \\"Antonov Apples: smell good, but not of democracy,\\" he remarked in his letter to Konstantin Pyatnitsky in November 1901.The Collected Works of Maxim Gorky in 30 volumes.

Zhizn, 1901, No.4, April. Pyotr Yakubovich, writing in Russkoye Bogatstvo found this short story an example of Bunin's tendency to distance himself from real life, excelling in making fine pictures of it. \\"A finely crafted picture of a night in a train, casual talks and thoughts accompanied by wagon wheels,\\" wrote critic Alexander Izmaylov in 1913. * Fog (Tuman, –¢—É–º–∞–Ω).

Russkaya Mysl, 1901, No.8, August. Alongside two other stories under the common title \\"Three Stories\\". Some details here, like the visit of Leo Tolstoy's followers, or the walks along the streets of a provincial town, reminding Poltava, are autobiographical. * In the Autumn (Osenju, –û—Å–µ–Ω—å—é). Mir Bozhy, 1902, No.1, January, subtitled \\"The Sketch\\" (Eskiz, –≠—Å–∫–∏–∑). –°hekhov was not impressed. \\"Bunin's In the Autumn: done with a tense, unrelaxed hand,\\" he wrote in a letter to Olga Knipper on January 31, 1902.The Works of A.P.Chekhov, Vol.12, Moscow, 1964, P. 432 * New Year (Novy god, –ù–æ–≤—ã–π –≥–æ–¥).

The Stories (Rasskazy, –†–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã, 1902) compilation. According to Vera Muromtseva-Bunina, in 1902 Bunin wrote just one piece of prose, and that was \\"Hope\\". Nikolai Teleshov, to whom the author sent the story, was unimpressed. \\"No, Iv[an] Al[exeyevich]! The story might be lean, but it is hardly muscular... Feels like reading somebody else's letters... Put simply, I dislike it, that is all,\\" he wrote on 15 March 1902. Bunin disagreed. \\"As for 'Hope', you are just wrong: it is a beautiful, subtle thing. And there is no need for you to cringe; it's not obnoxious that I'm trying here to be, just frank,\\" he replied on 21 March. ;1903 * Dreams (Sny, –°–Ω—ã).

All in all, Bunin's prose featured in sixteen Znanye compilations. Both stories received a good press. \\"Bunin is a laconic painter, working in sketches. Artfulness is not for him, he's too an artist for that. And if his characters look like social types, that is because the extraordinary realism of their author makes them undeniably typical,\\" wrote critic Alexander Amfiteatrov.Rus (newspaper).

Znanye collection, Book 1, Saint Petersburg, 1904, along with \\"Dreams\\", as part of two-piece \\"Blacksoil\\". This story later gave the title to Bunin's collection which came out in 1913 and, in a revised version, in 1914. While preparing it for the later, Bunin divided the text into five chapters and parted with the fragments describing old time landlords' cruelty towards serf peasants. * Distant Things (Dalyokoye, –î–∞–ª—ë–∫–æ–µ).

In Paris (Poslednye Novosty newspaper, 1937, No.5993, August 22) Bunin published a renewed version of the story, entitled \\"Eight Years\\" (Vosem let, –í–æ—Å–µ–º—å –ª–µ—Ç) with a footnote: \\"The Life of Arsenyev.

Frans Breydel was a younger brother of the painter Karel Breydel. There is no information about his training. He left for a trip, maybe to Italy, at an early age but stayed in Kassel when his work was favourably received by local patrons. He was appointed painter to the local court. Merry company When his brother Karel left for a trip to Italy and heard about Frans' success in Kassel, he abandoned his plans to go to Italy and travelled instead to Kassel to join his brother. Here the two brothers worked together for two years with considerable success. Karel Breydel then travelled to Amsterdam.Biographical details on Frans Breydel at the Nouvelle Biographie Nationale Frans later left Kassel for London where he linked up with the Dutch painter Herman van der Mijn. This must have been before 1724. Little is known about the remainder of his life. According to the French 18th-century biographer Jean-Baptiste Descamps, Frans Breydel died in Antwerp in 1750 where he was buried in the St. Andrew's Church.

Chavez officially changed political parties from Republican to Democrat on April 28, 2014. Politics =2012 campaign= In 2012, Chavez mounted a campaign as a Republican write-in candidate against Democrat Ed Pastor for the District 7 seat. Incumbent Pastor was challenged by Democrat Rebecca Witt in the August 2012 primary for the 7th Congressional District, but Pastor \\"easily bested\\" Witt. Chavez ran as the only Republican candidate. In that election, Pastor was elected to a 12th term in congress, \\"easily\\" winning the election. With Chavez mounting the write-in campaign, he was not listed as the official Republican in election result announcements. =2013 campaign= In 2013, Chavez ran for the Phoenix City Council District 4 seat. \\"Longtime\\" councilman Tom Simplot announced that he would not seek reelection for the 2013 election, which resulted in more candidates running for one City Council seat than any other district in the United States that election. Candidates included Chavez, then running under Scott Fistler; Jeffrey Brown; Dan Carroll; Austin Head; Justin Johnson, son of former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson; David Lujan; and Laura Pastor, daughter of Ed Pastor. At the time, Chavez had lived in Phoenix eight years. On the official City Council candidate form, Chavez listed his favorite book as The Sneetches by Dr. Seuss and his favorite movie as Rocky. Early results showed Kate Gallego and Laura Pastor leading the polls. Eventually, Pastor won Simplot's seat and Gallego won Councilman Michael Johnson's seat after he termed out after 12 years in office. Chavez' bid for the City Council seat was unsuccessful, with Pastor, Gallego and then incumbents Jim Waring (District 2) and Sal DiCiccio (District 6) comprising the council. =2014 campaign= In 2014, Chavez again ran for a seat on Arizona's 7th congressional district. On June 17, 2014, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Rea ruled that Chavez was ineligible to run based on the signatures being invalid. Chavez represented himself in court and stated that he would appeal the ruling. He also appealed to voters to \\"funnel money\\" to him and to find him an attorney. The Arizona secretary of state's office stated that almost half (just under 700) of the signatures were invalid. Chavez's 2014 campaign website was hosted on Blogspot. =2016 campaign= Chavez tried to run again in 2016, asking the Arizona Democratic Party to list him as a candidate on the ballot. They refused, stating that he was not a serious candidate. They also received a court order to keep Chavez from harassing them, stating that he threatened them. In response, Chavez stated, \\"This is a slap in the face for not only veterans in America, but for veteran families, immigrants, everybody because we should want to go to the polls and vote.\\" Name change Chavez changed his name from Scott Fistler to Cesar Chavez in December 2013. He was criticized for changing his name and switching political parties to try and gain Hispanic votes in District 7, which is heavily Hispanic. Chavez rebutted those accusations, saying the name change was to get a shorter name, an easier to pronounce name, and that he was inspired by a dog food brand. The official reason Chavez listed for changing his name on court paperwork was that he \\"had experienced many hardships because of his name.\\" Chavez was charged $319 for the name change.

Biography  =Early life= Baird was born in Seattle, Washington. He was exposed to music at an early age by his father, a trumpet player who played in rock bands and doubled on an eclectic collection of instruments, including saxophone, flute, Rhodes, synthesizer and percussion. His family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1996. He began to play the saxophone around age ten, eventually studied jazz and improvisation for several years with saxophonist Alan Braufman. During his teenage years, Baird became highly influenced by the music of saxophonist Michael Brecker. A chance encounter with drummer Jeff Hamilton inspired Baird to try to connect with Brecker directly for music lessons. After making contact via Brecker's manager, Brecker agreed to meet in person next time he traveled through Salt Lake City in early 2003. Although brief, Baird cites Brecker's mentorship around this time as influential on the trajectory of his career. In 2004, Baird's family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He began to collaborate with other young musicians, including pianist Julian Waterfall Pollack. He graduated from Acalanes High School in Lafayette, California in 2006. =2006‚Äìpresent= Baird attended Diablo Valley College for one year, where he studied as a psychology major. He later transferred to California State University, Long Beach to study music, notably with saxophonists Eric Marienthal, Sal Lozano and Jay Mason and program director Jeff Jarvis.

In 2009, he was featured in the soundtrack to Emancipated, a film by P.K. Ziainia with music by composer Rodrigo Denis. Baird recorded and released his debut album, Crosscurrent, in 2010. The album featured pianist Julian Waterfall Pollack, guitarist John Storie, bassist Christopher Tordini, drummer Steve Lyman and percussionist James Yoshizawa. Baird joined drummer Antonio S√°nchez's group Migration in 2018, recording both saxophone and Electronic Wind Instrument on the group's critically acclaimed album Lines in the Sand.

Joseph Richardson Life Born at Hexham, Northumberland, he was the only child of Joseph Richardson, a tradesman there. He was educated at Haydon Bridge school, and admitted sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1774. His father's means were insufficient for the complete education of his son, and the cost of his residence at college was borne by a titled lady of Northumberland who discovered his talents, but in 1778 she cut off her contributions. Although he was readmitted as pensioner on 25 September 1780, he left the university without taking a degree. Richardson, intended as he was for the church, entered the Middle Temple on 24 March 1781, where he was duly called to the bar. In London he in fact concentrated on journalism, and after appearing as counsel in a few contested election petitions, gave up the legal profession. Richardson's earliest journalistic post was on the staff of The Morning Post, then still a Whig paper, and he later became one of its proprietors. While connected with the Post he fought a duel in Hyde Park with Sir Henry Bate Dudley, and was wounded in the right arm. He also contributed letters, signed \\"Englishman\\", to a paper called The Citizen. Richard Wilson, Member of Parliament for and an old friend, introduced Richardson to the Duke of Northumberland. The Duke's influence brought him the seat of Newport in Cornwall in Parliament, from 1796 until his death. He never had the confidence to speak in the House of Commons. For many years Richard assisted Richard Brinsley Sheridan in the management of Drury Lane Theatre, and ultimately acquired a share in the property. (The money for this purchase was mainly from the Duke of Northumberland, and on Richardson's death the Duke cancelled the loan.) His comedy, The Fugitive, was brought out at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket by the Drury Lane Company with success on 20 April 1792, and, when printed, passed through three editions. The prologue was by Richard Tickell and the epilogue by John Burgoyne. Richardson also wrote the prologue to the Glorious First of June, the after-piece which was acted at Drury Lane on 2 July 1794 for the benefit of the widows and children of the sailors who died at the naval battle of that name. Despite failing health, Richardson stuck to the rigorous parliamentary life. One night he remained in the House of Commons until five o'clock in the morning to record his vote in the small minority with Charles James Fox. He then went to the Wheatsheaf Inn, near Virginia Water, and died on 9 June 1803. He was buried in Egham churchyard on 13 June. Works As a satirist, Richard was best known for his contributions to the Rolliad and the Probationary odes‚Äîpublications each of which passed through 21 editions. For the former Richardson wrote Nos. 4, 10, and 11 in part i. and 3 and 4 in part ii.; while for the latter he wrote Nos. 4 and 19, the Delavaliad, other poems, and much of the prose. He wrote many other fugitive pieces for the Whigs, and contributed to the Political Miscellanies (1790). His best-known satire was entitled Jekyll, an Eclogue (see under Joseph Jekyll). He published for his party in 1787 an anonymous pamphlet, called The complete Investigation of Mr. Eden's Treaty, which embodied reputable commercial statistics. Sarah Richardson published by subscription Literary Relics of the late Joseph Richardson (1807). This included the play The Fugitive, a few short poems, and a sketch of his life, written by John Taylor. Some letters by Richardson are in Samuel Parr's Works and in Thomas Moore's Sheridan. Family Richardson's wife Sarah, a relative of Isaac Watts, survived him, with four daughters.

The bill would require the DOE to collect the data from all federal agencies and store it in one place online. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the United States Secretary of Energy (DOE), acting through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, to act as the lead federal agency for coordinating and disseminating information on existing federal programs and assistance that may be used to help initiate, develop, and finance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy retrofitting projects for schools. The bill would require the Secretary to: (1) carry out a review of existing programs and financing mechanisms available in or from appropriate federal agencies with jurisdiction over energy financing and facilitation that are currently used or may be used for such purposes; (2) establish a federal cross-departmental collaborative coordination, education, and outreach effort to streamline communication and promote available federal opportunities and assistance for such projects that enables states, local educational agencies, and schools to use existing federal opportunities more effectively and to form partnerships with governors, state energy programs, local educational, financial, and energy officials, state and local officials, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate entities to support project initiation; (3) provide technical assistance for states, local educational agencies, and schools to help develop and finance projects that meet specified requirements; (4) develop and maintain a single online resource website with contact information for relevant technical assistance and support staff in the Office for states, local educational agencies, and schools to effectively access and use federal opportunities and assistance to develop such projects; and (5) establish a process for recognition of schools that have successfully implemented such projects and are willing to serve as resources for other local educational agencies and schools to assist initiation of similar efforts. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4092 would require the Secretary of Energy to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools. The bill would direct the Secretary to work with other federal agencies to develop a comprehensive list of such federal programs and to streamline efforts to publicize them through education and outreach. Based on information from the Department of Energy (DOE) about current levels of spending for similar efforts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4092 would not significantly affect the federal budget. We estimate that any additional costs incurred by DOE to expand existing efforts to promote opportunities to boost energy efficiency of schools under H.R. 4092 would total less than $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. H.R. 4092 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4092 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 26, 2014 by Rep. Matthew A. Cartwright (D, PA-17). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. The bill was scheduled to be voted on under a suspension of the rules on June 23, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Cartwright, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"the bill is a strategic and cost-saving investment to relieve the fiscal pressure felt by schools across the country while bringing us closer to energy security.\\" Cartwright cited statistics from Energy Star indicating that schools in the United States spend $6 billion a year on energy bills, the second largest category of spending after personnel. ASHRAE, formerly the \\"American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers\\", supported the bill. The U.S. Green Building Council also supported the bill, saying that it \\"aims to make important improvements to existing federal policies.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4092 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4092 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4092 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4092 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4092 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4092 *House Energy Committee markup of H.R. 4092 Category:United States proposed federal environmental legislation Category:Energy in the United States Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:2014 in the environment ","title":"Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014"},{"id":"43104784","title":"Topsy Turvy (song)"},{"id":"43104789","text":"Pleasant Valley Township is a township in Wilson County, Kansas, in the United States.

Valentine is best known for his metal-plate biomorphic sculptures that build on the formalism of mid-century American sculptors, such as Alexander Calder, and John McCraken. His sculptures have been internationally recognized. and commissioned by the federal government of Canada. He is currently completing a major sculpture commission The Dream Ballet, for the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts Plaza, in front of Daniel Libeskind‚Äôs L Tower residence building in Toronto, Ontario. Important sculpture works include: * Persephone * Blue Bird * The Dove * Dream Ballet In 2014, alongside architect David Binder, Valentine unveiled \\"The 30 Carabob Quartet\\", which was the first outdoor sculpture park in Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario. The four sculptures of the series came from Valentine's first large scale sculpture series The Barbarians. That series was first exhibited at The Campbell House museum in 2013. Aside from sculpture, he sparked his early career with photographic collages of iconic urban topographies, such as Parisian landmarks and American Architecture.  Style  Valentine often invites the role of performance, film and photography in the creation and presentation of his works, as seen in his 2014 short video project, \\"The Dance of The Dove\\", featuring a stop motion collage of a Canadian ballerina dancing around Valentine \\"Dove\\" sculpture. Valentine employs 3D modelling and printing in the creation of his monumental works. He uses the Makerbot z18 to make these 3D printed maquettes, which Valenitne has said he considers as artworks themselves, staging the prototype prints next to full scale works in exhibition. This style of working from model to monument is profiled in the video From Model to Monument. His sculptures and photo-sculptural works focus on the theme of collapse and the rebirth of civilizations, while questioning the constructs of a glorious, unattainable past.  Inspiration  In a national newspaper interview profiling Valentine when he was named among Canada‚Äôs \\"Worthy 30\\", the artist said he takes his inspiration every morning from a Picasso lithograph, his most prized possession. \\"It‚Äôs my golden chalice. I drink from its creativity every morning.\\" He has said that two seminal ancient sculptures, \\"The Diskobolus of Myron and Laco√∂n and His Son, serve as his ongoing \\"spiritual navigators.\\" Canadian painter, and co-Toronto citizen, Charles Pachter also inspired and influenced Valentine's work. Selected works = Parisian Mirrored Gateways = Gateways is a luxurious, experimental series of digital photo-sculptural work, deconstructing iconic Paris landscapes on large-scale mirrors. The project dealt with the illusions of a Parisian promised land, every artist‚Äôs and hopeless romantic‚Äôs fairytale of a creative Elysium. By re-arranging, inverting, and folding in upon themselves iconic Paris landmarks, such as the Champs-√âlys√©es and Pont Neuf, the city and its myth are dissected into its molecular building blocks. Printed on door-sized mirrors using an experimental process, Valentine challenges the viewer to reflect on their own complicity, and desires, in creating the Paris myth. = Sony Center/ L-Tower = In 2013, Valentine completed production of his first major public art installation, The Dream Ballet, which is to be unveiled at the Claude Cormier-designed Sony Centre Plaza, in front of Daniel Liebeskind‚Äôs L-Tower residence. For Valentine, being awarded this commission was \\"nothing if not a career-defining project for an artist not yet out of his 20s.\\" The project consists of a triptych designed in homage to the National Ballet of Canada's four-decade residence at the site; the three sculptures depict abstracted ballet dancers in various dynamic positions = The North Pole = In February 2013, Valentine unveiled his controversial sculpture The North Pole, which plays on themes of aboriginal art and global warming, at the De Luca Fine Arts gallery. For it, Valentine cast in bronze a seven-foot, 100-year-old narwhal tusk. Drawing on a desire to bring attention to the receding arctic ice floes, as well as the controversial decision to re-appropriate a symbol generally reserved for Aboriginal artists, he insisted he \\" wanted to emphasize that the tusk is a miracle of creation in its own right, not just the source of a luxurious material for doing other things\\" = Riflessi Monument = Unveiling of Riflessi Monument Valentine‚Äôs Riflessi: Italian Canadian Internment Memorial, was unveiled on Wednesday, June 26, 2013 at the Columbus Centre.http://italiancanadianww2.ca/images/uploads/main/5680/post- event_monument_release_june_28_final.pdf The reflective, metal plated monument, standing atop a checkered marble platform, \\"explores the struggles and successes of the Italian Canadian immigrant story and the Italian Canadian internment history.\\" Funded by the government of Canada, the event was attended by Hon. Julian Fantino, Minister of International Cooperation, and former Canadian Senator Hon. Consiglio Di Nino, as well as families of interned Italian-Canadians. The Canadian minister said Valentine‚Äôs work helped \\"us all recognize the experiences of the Italian-Canadian community and ensure that the stories are not lost. This is the reason why today‚Äôs unveiling [‚Ä¶] is such an important contribution in helping to preserve this part of our national narrative.Julian Fantinohttp://italiancanadianww2.ca/images/uploads/main/5680/post- event_monument_release_june_28_final.pdf\\" = Persephone = Valentine‚Äôs Persephone was the first public sculpture acquired for Humber College's Lakeshore Campus. It features a modern interpretation of Persephone, the Greek goddess of Spring. The nine-foot tall sculpture is prominently placed in a high traffic area of the college campus, allowing students and faculty to interact with it. \\"Sometimes the sculpture adopts a tall, quiet presence, while at other times students purposively interact with it through observance and discussion.\\" = Barbarians at the Gate = This outdoor public installation was named as one of the Best Art Shows of 2013 by the Huffington Post. Barbarians is a series of five colorful, abstract metal sculptures installed throughout the grounds of the historic Campbell House Museum in downtown Toronto. The show created a stark contrast between the Campbell‚Äôs 19th-century architecture and Valentine‚Äôs 21st-century sculptures. Inspired by the mythical creatures of ancient Greece, including the Minotaur and Cerberus, the exhibition \\"raised questions about the collapse and rebirth of civilizations; about creative destruction; and whether the new replaces the old, or the old is the hidden engine of the new.\\" = The 30 Carabob Quartet = This sculpture park was the first of its kind to be created in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough. A co-operative effort with architect David Binder, Valentine transposed the sculptures from the Barbarian series to this residential tower landscape, for this permanent, free public exhibit. The creators of the project both say they were inspired and driven to enliven the urban landscape with this installation.

The exhibition was curated from works in the museum's permanent collection, which consists primarily of 19th-century portraiture and southern plantation scenes to reveal how the collection and architecture have been used to spatialize and reinforce issues of class and race.# A Break with Tradition: Gibbes Museum of Art celebrates centennial with provocative exhibit.‚Äù By Jack MacCray. Post & Courier. (January 20, 2005). Huff + Gooden's 2005 international competition winning design for the Virginia Key Beach Park Museum in Miami, Florida is included in the American architectural history textbook, USA: Modern Architectures in History (Reaktion Books, 2008) by Gwendolyn Wright. In chapter seven, ‚ÄúDisjunctures and Alternatives, 1985 to the Present‚Äù Wright states: \\"Significant architecture helps us confront contentious topics. Huff + Gooden, an African-American firm based in Charleston, South Carolina, have designed a small museum for the Virginia Key Beach Park (2005‚Äì8) that underscores the ambiguities of racial pride and segregation‚Ä¶. The structure and the larger landscape by Walter Hood continue the theme of multiplicities and changes over time. This new sensibility in American modern architecture encourages visitors to contemplate multiple dimensions of the past and the future, buildings and their surroundings.\\"# \\"Disjunctures and Alternatives\\", USA: Modern Architecture in History, Gwendolyn Wright. New York:Reaktion Books, 2008.  Research  Gooden's research formulated in his design studio teaching and through the Global Africa Lab (GAL) at Columbia University, focuses on the development of scripting tools and parametric software. Developed along with Adjunct Assistant Professor Carson Smuts, the parametric software enables users to data mine and source data from social media, census, and demographic Application Programming Interface (APIs): Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr, Statistics South Africa, The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, and NYC Open Data. The scripting tools allow users to create their own data sets using smart phone GPS and data gathering apps and to spatialize the data using Rhino¬Æ and Grasshopper¬Æ. The tools have been applied to trace the production and consumption of Middle Eastern art in the global art market; to spatialize data and events in North Africa and the Middle East during the Arab Spring uprisings; and to analyze the topological urbanisms of downtown Amman, Rio de Janeiro, and Johannesburg.  Writing  Gooden's book \\"Dark Space: Architecture, Representation, Black Identity\\" was published by Columbia University Press in 2016. The book offers a subtle reading of African American cultural institutions and calls for \\"more critical design and discourse.\\" In 2012, Gooden was awarded a MacDowell Colony residency and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. His article ‚Äú_ORM is a Four-Letter Word‚Ä¶‚Äù which examines avant-gardist's art practices and the relationships to architectural production and the de-emphasis of form, is published in Perspecta No. 43.# ‚Äú_ORM is a Four-Letter Word‚Ä¶That Starts with F.‚Äù Perspecta No. 43. The Yale Architecture Journal. December 2010. This article casts a line along which to consider a critical assessment of African-American architecture in his essays, Made in America and The Problem with African-American Architecture. Made in America examines issues of African-American identity related to style, design, and architecture and argues that African-Americans, caught between cultural traces and cultural absorption, are uniquely and completely American. The Problem with African-American Architecture re-asks the question that opens W. E. B. Dubois‚Äô essay The Souls of Black Folk.... ‚ÄúHow does it feel to be a problem?‚Äù In this essay Gooden analyzes the past thirty years of African- American museum design and the perceptual properties used to render cultural identity. These perceptual properties are the pre-occupation with the image of the African-American museum and its superficial aesthetics: its surfaces, skins, symbols and use of color which reinforce cultural stereotypes, clich√©s, and the mythologizing of conflated (even false) histories. He argues that rather than the idea of an African American museums as remediation for the past injustices of exclusion (that which focuses on remediation of a perceived ‚Äúproblem‚Äù), these museums should engage the questions of cultural identity, social and racial justice, and American identity as a concurrent i.e. contemporary discourse that seeks instead the construction of knowledge and that this architecture should become a form of knowledge rather than the knowledge of form, tropes, and superficial ‚ÄúAfricanisms‚Äù (token symbols of a mythologized African heritage).

Life Battage de colza dans la plaine de Lille (Threshing Rapeseed in the plain of Lille, 1861) Auguste-Joseph Herlin was born in Lille on 18 August 1815. His parents were Joseph Herlin and Julie Desrousseaux, both from Lille. His father was a merchant. After completing his studies at the local college he joined his father's business. He and his brother Th√©odore jointly managed the business. Between 1840 and 1848 he followed his marked penchant for the arts, and studied painting under Fran√ßois Souchon. He won two medals, including a first class medal in 1843. In 1850 Herlin resigned from business and devoted himself to the arts. With independent means, he was not dependent on his work to make a living and could paint what he wanted. Herlin's paintings belonged to the school of √âdouard Muller. He excelled both in his drawing and his use of color. His Visite au confr√®re, which drew much attention at the Lille Exhibition after it returned from the Salon of Paris, has been called a minor masterpiece. For many years Herlin was administrator of the academic schools in Lille and a member of the commissions of the Lille museums of painting and of drawing. In 1890 he was conservator of the Lille museum of painting and president of the commission of Lille museums. Herlin became a member of the Lille Society of Sciences and Arts in 1883, and became the society's president in 1892. In 1891 Herlin was named a knight of the Legion of Honor for his services to the arts. Herlin died on 13 December 1900 at the age of 85.

It is approximately long and flows through Fairmont Township, Huntington Township, and New Columbus in Luzerne County; and Fishing Creek Township in Columbia County. The creek's watershed has an area of 30.7 square miles and is located in Columbia and Luzerne Counties. Its tributaries include Bell Branch and Little Pine Creek. The vicinity of the creek was settled in the late 1700s. The main industries in the watershed in the early 1900s were timber and agriculture. Pine Creek is designated as a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery. Northern myotis bats also inhabit areas near the creek. Course Pine Creek looking upstream in its lower reaches Pine Creek begins in western Fairmount Township, Luzerne County, near the border between Luzerne County and Columbia County. It flows southeast for a few miles, entering a valley and receiving the tributaries Brish Run and Wasp Branch. The creek then turns south, passing near Red Hill. Further downstream, it enters Huntington Township. Shortly after entering this township, the creek picks up Bell Creek and continues south, crossing Pennsylvania Route 239 and entering the borough of New Columbus. On the southern side of New Columbus, the creek leaves Luzerne County and enters Columbia County. Upon entering Columbia County, Pine Creek begins flowing through Fishing Creek Township. It makes several meanders before making a final turn south and reaching its confluence with Huntington Creek in the community of Jonestown. Pine Creek joins Huntington Creek of its mouth. =Tributaries= Tributaries of Pine Creek include Brish Run, Wasp Branch, Bell Creek, Spring Branch, and Little Pine Creek. Little Pine Creek has a watershed area of 7.15 square miles and joins Pine Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography, geology, and climate The watershed of Pine Creek has been described as \\"rough and hilly\\". Its valley is narrow and the hills around it are steep. The creek's channel is sinuous. The channel of Pine Creek goes through sandstone. upstream of its mouth, the elevation of Pine Creek is above sea level. upstream of the mouth, the elevation is above sea level. At its mouth, the creek's elevation is above sea level. On average, the annual level of precipitation in the vicinity of Pine Creek ranges from . Watershed Pine Creek in New Columbus The watershed of Pine Creek has an area of 30.7 square miles. It is located in northeastern Columbia County and northwestern Luzerne County. The uppermost reaches of the watershed are on North Mountain. Communities in the watershed of Pine Creek include Cambria, New Columbus, and Fairmount Springs. In 1921, these communities had populations of 213, 175, and 100, respectively. History Johnathan Westover, an early settler of Huntington Township, Luzerne County settled in the northwestern part of the township, near Pine Creek. Abram Dodder, a member of the second family to inhabit Fishing Creek Township, in Columbia County, settled on the creek in 1786. His father arrived there in 1788. In 1814, Pine Creek was designated as a public highway between a sawmill belonging to Amos Buckalew in Columbia County and a location near Johnathan Westover's sawmill in Huntington Township, Luzerne County. The August 19, 1890 Columbia/Luzerne County Tornado, passed by the creek, where it had a smell resembling sulfur. The tornado was moving at approximately per hour at this point. A woolen mill was built on Little Pine Creek, a tributary of Pine Creek, circa 1820. In the 1800s, D. Chatfield Brittain owned a 62-acre tract of forest on Pine Creek. In the early 1900s, industries in the vicinity of Pine Creek included agriculture and timber. Biology The northern myotis bat was observed to be living on Pine Creek in 1999. The exact population of the bats here is not known. Pine Creek is designated as a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery.

The key people involved are John R. Wilmoth (Director) from the University of California, Berkeley, Vladimir Shkolnikov (Co-Director) from Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and Magali Barbieri (Associate Director) from the University of California, Berkeley, and INED, Paris. History =Creation of the Berkeley Mortality Database, a precursor to the Human Mortality Database= In 1997, John R. Wilmoth at the Department of Demography in the University of California, Berkeley started work on a database titled the Berkeley Mortality Database (BMD) with a grant from the National Institute of Aging in the United States. The BMD included data across the entire age range, but was restricted to only four countries (France, Japan, Sweden, and the United States). For the most part, the Berkeley Mortality Database is now superseded by the Human Mortality Database, but the BMD is still available online because some types of data available in the BMD have not been transferred to the HMD. =Creation and development of the Kannisto-Thatcher Database on Old Age Mortality= The Kannisto-Thatcher Database on Old Age Mortality (KTD) was founded in 1993 by V√§in√∂ Kannisto and Roger Thatcher with the support and collaboration of James Vaupel, Kirill Andreev, and many others. The KTD was first developed at Odense University Medical School in Denmark. Since 1996, it has been maintained and developed by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Unlike the BMD, the KTD focused only on mortality above the age of 80, but included 30 countries (compared to the BMD, that included data for only 4 countries). =Creation and development of the Human Mortality Database= HMD began in 2000 as a collaborative project of the Department of Demographics at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, with funding from the National Institute of Aging in the United States. It used data from the BMD (which had launched in 1997) and was also strongly influenced by the Kannisto-Thatcher Database on Old Age Mortality. After about two years of development, the HMD was formally launched in May 2002. HMD inherited the coverage of all age groups from BMD and the coverage of a diverse range of countries from KTD, thus combining the best features of both databases. The methods protocol of HMD has steadily evolved and was last updated on May 31, 2007. Reception =Academic reception= HMD data has been cited in academic research in demographic research and other research that relies of demographic data. For instance, there has been considerable research on the biological and evolutionary factors determining mortality and the differences in mortality across human populations. The data has also been cited in research that attempts to build better predictive models of human mortality. It has also been cited in research on specific causes of mortality and research on the social and economic consequences of changes in mortality. =Media reception= HMD data has been cited in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Foreign Affairs.

Suisa was one of the key figures in the movement to unite Naga-populated areas in Manipur with the Naga Hills (Nagaland). He was popularly known as 'Uncle Suisa'. Rungsung Suisa belonged to the Tangkhul Naga tribe. He was the son of Rungsung Luithui. He hailed from Somdal, Ukhrul district.The Sangai Express. Nagas' demand for integration: A historical perspective - II He studied at the Jorhat Christian High School. He was amongst the first youths of the Manipur hill people to obtain matriculate education. Suisa was one of five hill leaders named by the President Manipur State Darbar to participate in the Constitution-Making Committee in 1946. However, Suisa and the other hill leaders did not attend the first session of the Committee. On 13 August 1947 he chaired a meeting of hill leaders, at which the assembled demanded that the hill peoples should have the right to secede from Manipur after a five-year period. However, these demands were not heeded by the Committee, and in the new constitution the administration of the hill areas was placed under the control of the Maharaja. In June 1948 he was elected unopposed to the Manipur State Assembly. In 1949 he visited Burma, and came into contact with the Communist Party of Burma. His experience in Burma radicalized his political approach, taking a more revolutionary stance in local politics upon his return. He became a member of the Manipur Electoral College in 1951. Suisa was elected to the Lok Sabha (lower house of the parliament of India) in the 1957 general election. He stood as the Indian National Congress candidate in Outer Manipur constituency, obtaining 21,316 votes (26.24% of the votes in the constituency).Election Commission of India. STATISTICAL REPORT ON GENERAL ELECTIONS, 1957 TO THE SECOND LOK SABHA - VOLUME I (NATIONAL AND STATE ABSTRACTS & DETAILED RESULTS) In parliament, he was represented in various committees. The Manipur Naga Council boycotted the 1962 general election and Suisa was one of the Naga leaders that was detained at Dum Dum for about a year. Suisa was assistant to the vice president of the Naga National Council 1964-1966. In October 1966, following the deadlock in the peace talks, he presented a proposal to solve the Indo-Naga conflict through confederation, with shared responsibilities between India and Nagaland on foreign and military affairs, but full Naga sovereignty on internal affairs. He sought to mediate between the Indian government and the Naga leaders. Allegedly, Indira Gandhi was open to accept Suisa's proposal. However, the NNC opposed these moves and did not accept his proposal, as it went against their demand of complete independence. Suisa had travelled to London together with Vizol in June 1967 to present the proposal to Angami Zapu Phizo but it was rebuffed by him.

The album features six tracks, and was digitally released on on Eros Music. Development A. R. Rahman revealed his inclusion in the debut film of Arif Ali in early 2014. The first track \\"Khalifa\\" was written and composed in a single night, a result of the team's jamming sessions. The film's producer stated, \\"Khalifa was composed during the first recording session that we had with Rahman Sir.

He is perhaps best known for being one of several prominent American Indians to spearhead the movement against the use of Native American imagery as sports mascots. Early life Robert Roche was born Robert Joseph Roche on 3 May 1947 at Saint Ann's Hospital located in Cleveland, Ohio. Robert is a member of the Chiricahua Apache, a tribe of the Apache living in the Southwestern part of the United States. He would end up meeting Russell Means, a well-known actor, civil rights activist and founder of the Cleveland branch of the American Indian Movement. He would profoundly influence a young Roche, and the two would go on to collaborate on many projects. Career From 1974 to 1984, Roche worked in the City of Cleveland Juvenile Court Division as an Acting Probation Officer. During this time, he worked with indigenous youth who had come in contact with and were already in the juvenile justice system. In 1995, Robert Roche founded the American Indian Education Center, a non-profit organization that offered a variety of re-entry services for the American Indian population in the greater Greater Cleveland area, including HIV testing, tutoring, smoking cessation classes, cultural programming and resume writing instruction. in Cleveland, Ohio. Roche opened the American Indian Education Center to provide a more comprehensive variety of services after the two decades of controversy its \\"predecessor,\\" the Cleveland American Indian Center, founded by Russell Means, had been embroiled in. in Cleveland, Ohio. Robert currently serves as the executive director of the American Indian Education Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Some of the work he carried out was documented in a book written by attorney Joseph Patrick Meissner as part of a compendium of accounts focusing on people who work to improve their community. Robert Roche has also taught a course in Oberlin College's Experimental College Department about the history of the Native American civil rights organization, the American Indian Movement. Activism Roche is an active member of the Cleveland branch of the Autonomous American Indian Movement (AAIM), a separate division of the American Indian Movement. Robert Roche has been a highly visible figure on the Cleveland scene for many decades, periodically using his role as a leader in the community to act as a character witness. He provided testimony in the clemency hearing for Billy Slagle, who was convicted of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications after, in 1987, he stabbed babysitter Mari Anne Pope to death while the children she was babysitting watched. In the appeal, Roche explained that Slagle, whose mother was Native American, visited the American Indian Education Center with his family as a child. Roche recalled alcohol abuse and violence were prominent fixtures in Slagle's home and believed Slagle would have been incapable of murder if it were not his addictions. Roche worked to raise awareness for Cleveland kidnapping victim Amanda Berry, who is part Native American, by writing letters to the city police department and holding candlelight vigils for her. Roche engaged in annual protests against Cleveland Indians mascot Chief Wahoo since 1973. He also founded the group \\"People, Not Mascots\\", a cohort which is dedicated to raise awareness against the use of a race of people as mascots and end the current use of offensive Native American imagery. As he explained, \\"We are not mascots. I'm nobody's mascot. My children are not mascots. \\"It mocks us as a race of people. It mocks our religion.\\" Roche's protest at the Indians' 2014 home opener went viral when local blogger Peter Pattakos, who had hoped to film an argument for an anti- Chief Wahoo documentary, instead staged a confrontation by goading Pedro Rodriguez, a Latino fan wearing red face paint and a fake feather headdress, into approaching Roche on camera. On 25 June 2014, major news media outlets began reporting that Robert Roche would file a lawsuit against the Cleveland Indians organization in July. Roche would be suing the team in excess of $9 billion. According to Roche, compensation would be sought based on the length of time and exploitation which has occurred from the use of the mascot. \\"We're going to be asking for $9 billion and we're basing it on a hundred years of disparity, racism, exploitation and profiteering,\\" Roche said. \\"It's been offensive since day one. We are not mascots. My children are not mascots. We are people.\\" Criticism Robert Roche has been the subject of criticism from some members within the Cleveland Native American community. Philip Joseph Yenyo, an Aztec Indian, protester, and member of the American Indian Movement of Ohio, claimed that Roche had constructed a false identity, claiming to have a birth certificate which reveals that Robert Roche was really Jose Roche. However, when asked to validate the nature of the injurious claims, Yenyo was unable to substantiate his accusations with material evidence. Roche has also been accused by members of the Native American community of using the Center as a platform for himself while failing to provide a consistent regimen of services. Roche was also asked by one of the founders of the original American Indian Movement to stop identifying himself as a member of the organization. According to Vernon Bellecourt, Robert Roche had never been an AIM representative in Ohio. \\"We have known for some time that he was invoking the name of AIM,\\" Bellcourt said. \\"We feel if people are doing good work in our name, it's OK. But that is not the case with Roche. We received complaints about him from leaders of the Indian community, and that was enough to cause us to issue the letter.\\" Despite identifying himself as a representative of the Autonomous America Indian Movement, Roche would also state that he was representative or executive director of Cleveland AIM, even doing so in a resume where he describes himself as an \\"appointed American Indian Movement executive director - Cleveland Ohio, 1994-present.\\" There have also questions raised about the use of grant funds allocated to the American Indian Education Center Roche operates. The Ohio Attorney General's Office launched an investigation into the use of the Center's finances following a 2013 anonymous complaint that alleged the American Indian Education Center mishandled the grant money it had been appropriated, and the fact Roche paid $153,00.00 in salary and benefits to himself that year, according to the tax filing. Closer examination to the available financial records, however, showed that Roche paid himself in relative proportion of grant funding allocated to the organization. In 2012, the American Indian Education Center received $650,000.00 in grant funding, an elevated increase in comparison from previous years. This was due largely to a Department of Education grant aimed at improving education for impoverished and underprivileged kids. In 2011, when the center was allocated $235,000.00 in grant funding, Roche paid himself only $37,000.00. Prior to that year, in 2010, when the Center was allocated $42,000.00 in grants, Roche, who served as the executive director, and the sole full-time employee on staff (who also worked seven days a week), paid himself only $12,000.00. During that same year, he also wrote a $16,000.00 loan for the center. On the tax filing, under \\"purpose,\\" it read: \\"Keep Center Open.\\" New details into the mismanagement of money allocated to the American Indian Education Center have slowly emerged. It was revealed that the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also launched an independent investigation into the American Indian Education Center. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) starting in 2011. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Health, had provided thousands of dollars to the American Indian Education Center from 2011 onwards. However, due to the placement of a \\"high risk restriction\\" on the Center, access to the SAMHSA grant money was on a limited basis. The investigation also cites the lack of proper financial management to administer the federal grant. The probe has also identified certain irregularities into the expenditure of funds provided by the SAMHSA. These irregularities included the $136,000.00 salary Roche paid himself in 2012, which did not appear to be concordant with wages supplied in grant documentation provided by the American Indian Education Center, the flat fees paid to the center's grant writer, McGuire & Associates, are inconsistent with standard practice, and the Center's bylaws giving Roche governing authority and control over his board of directors, are not in keeping with federal guidelines, which state that the board should operate independently of its director. There are also matters of personnel costs, related taxes and fringe benefit payments that The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is looking into. One grant received by the American Indian Education Center received in 2012 carried over into 2013. However, the rant was terminated by the grantor, the Ohio Department of Education, which decided that the program being funded by the grant was ineffective. Roche also made an attempt to open a second education center for American Indian people in the city of Columbus, Ohio in spite of financial difficulties faced during 2012. Although he cited poor health and financial difficulties, Roche registered a 1989 Jaguar in the \\"unfinished\\" Columbus Center's name in December 2012. According to Roche, he donated the car to the center, where he plans to raffle the vehicle in the name of American Indian services. =Embezzlement= Prior to his August 2018 indictment, Roche had been under investigation from the Department of Health and Human Services for several years. Investigators found Roche to have conspired with consultant Craig McGuire, whose company wrote grant applications, to steal the Circle of Care grant money. In April 2017, McGuire had pled guilty to conspiracy and theft of government funds. Investigators said Roche worked with consultant Craig McGuire to steal Circle of Care grant money. According to Roche's indictment, the two secured grants meant to support the mental health and wellness programs for American Indian and Alaskan families and children. McGuire, whose company wrote grant applications, pleaded guilty in April 2017 to conspiracy and theft of government funds. Roche and consultant Craig McGuire conspired to divert money from the American Indian Education Center. Investigators say McGuire submitted false applications to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). According to prosecutors, McGuire falsely claimed that the center offered an afterschool program for 500 children and had a \\"wellness department.\\" On 16 May 2018, Cleveland.com reported that Roche pled guilty to two counts of theft of government funds for stealing $77,000 in federal grant money meant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grant money to improve the well-being of American Indians and Alaskan Natives living in Northeast Ohio. Roche was sentenced with four months in prison followed by four months of home confinement. Roche was also ordered by the judge to pay $77,000 in restitution, the amount he was accused of stealing. Roche claimed he was in the early stages of dementia.

He is a four-time Downbeat Award winner. Biography Javier Arau was born in Santa Monica, California and raised in Sacramento, California. He received scholarships to attend Lawrence University in 1993 and New England Conservatory in 1998. He received an Outstanding Performance Award in 1994, Extended Jazz Composition awards in 1996 and 2000, and a Jazz Arranging award in 2000 from DownBeat Magazine. He also was the first-ever recipient of the ASCAP Young Jazz Composers Award, in 2002. He has been featured the New York Times, DownBeat Magazine, on NBC TV's Today in New York, and was the featured cover artist on the Saxophone Journal in August 2009. All About Jazz hailed, \\"Arau's 'Paper Train' is a marvelous bit of modern composition. Arau's 'Missouri Blues' toys with the edges of funk and fusion, and he puts grit into his tone to match. ...Good music based on strong roots.\\". Saxophone Journal noted, \\"Those who we remember best--Bach, Telemann, Vivaldi, Haydn and Mozart --did it all. Today there are very few who do it all, and an incredibly small proportion of them do it all extremely well. One who does is Javier Arau.\\" In 2009, he founded New York Jazz Academy, a NYC-based music school. He also leads the Javier Arau Jazz Orchestra. Publications Javier's compositions have received awards from ASCAP, BMI, DownBeat Magazine, and IAJE, and are published by UNC Jazz Press and Dorn Publications. At the age of 19, his transcription and analysis of Joe Henderson‚Äôs Grammy award-winning solo on Lush Life was published in IAJE‚Äôs Jazz Educators Journal, which became widely regarded as the definitive transcription of that iconic performance. Henderson got word of Javier's efforts and quickly became a mentor to him. Arau has published his \\"Augmented Scale Theory,\\" which helps bridge the gap between the chromatic tendencies of modern jazz and the diatonic roots of traditional jazz harmony, enabling the improviser to play creatively over such challenging material as Coltrane‚Äôs ‚ÄúGiant Steps‚Äù and Wayne Shorter classics.

He received his education in Carleton County and, with his family, homesteaded on Beaver Creek near Hanley in 1883. The family had bought 190 acres of land in Beaver Creek. After leaving home, Wilson worked in Moose Jaw, as guide for the transport department during the North-West Rebellion and served as a railway contractor along with his brother from 1884 to 1885. Wilson started merchandising in dray in 1883. From 1893 to 1896, he traded in food and livery along with H. McDonald. Wilson and his brothers sold the property after their parents moved to Saskatoon in 1899. After selling their property Wilson continued his business in partnership with his brother Archibald. The two brothers started Wilson Bros., a livery business; they later sold the company and began trading in carriages, harnesses and automobiles. In 1908, he married Ida Dunham of Brockville. Wilson served as the director of the Saskatoon Milling Company (later sold to Quaker Oats), and the Northwestern Telephone Company. He also served on the Soldier Land Settlement Board in 1919, and on Saskatoon's city council from 1923 to 1925. Wilson was a member of the Saskatoon School Board from 1906 to 1910 and from 1911 to 1912. After the University of Saskatchewan was established in 1907, Wilson became a member of the University's senate in 1914. In November 1925, Wilson was elected mayor of Saskatoon by acclamation, succeeding William Harvey Clare. After he suffered two strokes, the city's council granted him a leave of absence in September 1926. He was the shortest- serving mayor in Saskatoon's history. George Wesley Norman succeeded him. After suffering another stroke Wilson died in 1936. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery. His brother James served as the first mayor of Saskatoon after it was incorporated as a town on July 1, 1903. In 2006 it was found that a joint account (which he shared with a priest) had a total of $938.06 in it and the amount had remained unclaimed for the past 77 years.

It lives on shallow reefs on upper reef slopes, and is found from depths of 1‚Äì25 m. Crown-of-thorns starfish preferentially prey upon Acropora corals. It was described by Nemenzo in 1971. Description Acropora hyacinthus occurs in plate- or table-shaped wide colonies that consist of a number of thin branches in a lattice structure. It has strongly inclined branchlets. This pale species contains incipient axial and axial corallites that cannot be distinguished, and its branchlets contain cup-shaped radial corallites. All corallites on specimens of Acropora hyacinthus are darker than the main branch structure. The species looks similar to Acropora cytherea. File:Acropora hyacinthus, Kelso Reef.jpg File:Acropora hyacinthus, NPS.jpg File:Acropora hyacinthus, Poruma 2.jpg Growth rate Branching corals of the genus Acropora are among the fastest-growing taxa on most coral reefs. A. hyacinthus, average growth rates range from \\\\3 to 10 cm diameter increase per year, with much of this variation thought to be a response to temperature, in addition to competition and other abiotic and biotic factors (Tomascik et al. 1996; Wakeford et al. 2008;Linares et al. 2011). Distribution Acropora hyacinthus is classed as a data deficient species on the IUCN Red List, but it is believed that its population is decreasing in line with the global decline in reefs, and it is listed under Appendix II of CITES. Figures of its population are unknown, but is likely to be threatened by the global reduction of coral reefs, the increase of temperature causing coral bleaching, climate change, human activity, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) and disease. It occurs at depths from on the upper slopes of shallow reefs.

The design is typical of the second half of Barnett's career, when he shifted from Italianate to Second Empire designs, and represents a popular style in postbellum America. A mansard roof with slate tiles tops the house; a cornice running along the roofline features paired brackets. The front of the house features a wraparound porch supported by columns. The house's corners have bold quoins. In a deviation from the typical rectangular plans of Second Empire houses, Barnett gave the house a cross axis plan with projecting wings.

He was born in Belleville, Ontario in 1876 and came to Saskatoon as manager of the Union Bank in 1904. In 1907, Harrison opened a real estate and insurance business. He also served as secretary and treasurer of the Saskatoon Board of Trade. He married Zeta Mabel Charlebois in 1909. Harrison was a member of Saskatoon city council from 1911 to 1912. In 1913 he was elected mayor of the city. He had succeeded James Clinkskill. After the Germans attacked Ypres and sank the luxury ship Lusitania during the first world war Harrison ordered all the Germans and Austrians in Saskatoon to work under guard. He did not seek reelection after his term as mayor ended in 1915. Alexander MacGillivray Young succeeded him as the mayor in 1916. In 1916, he moved to Calgary, Alberta after accepting a position with the federal Department of Labour. His wife was charged with attempted murder in 1922 after shooting Harrison twice in the chest. She was convicted of the lesser charge of discharging a firearm after it was proved that she had removed the lead bullets from the shells; apparently, her intention was to scare her husband. Sometime after Harrison recovered, the couple were divorced. Harrison was named a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 for his work in industrial dispute settlement.

In 2015 she won the Allaire duPont Distaff Stakes and the Shuvee Handicap before recording her biggest success in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. She is owned by Town and Country Farms and trained by Todd Pletcher.  Two-year-old season  Stopchargingmaria was bred in Kentucky by Harvey Clarke and Brookdale Farm LLC. She was sold for $220,000 in the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company Selected Sale of Two-Year-Olds in Training sale in March 2013 by her consignor, Woodford Thoroughbreds. On July 19, 2013, Stopchargingmaria debuted in a 5-1/2 furlong Maiden Special Weight race at Saratoga Race Course and won handily. On September 1 she placed second to Sweet Reason in the Grade I Spinaway Stakes, also at Saratoga. Pletcher brought her back in five weeks to run in the Grade I Frizette Stakes run at a mile at Belmont Park, where she finished third to long shot Artemis Agrotera. On October 3 Stopchargingmaria won the Grade III Tempted Stakes run at one mile at Aqueduct Racetrack. She then won the Grade I Demoiselle Stakes run at a mile, also at Aqueduct. After five starts in four months, Pletcher decided to give Stopchargingmaria some time off and freshened her during the winter for a three-month break.  Three-year-old season  In her three-year-old debut, Stopchargingmaria's connections shipped her down to Florida for the winter. On February 22, 2014, she ran in the Grade II Davona Dale Stakes at Gulfstream Park and finished fifth behind her stablemate Onlyforyou. On April 5 she finished fourth to Sugar Shock in the Fantasy Stakes at a mile and one sixteenth at Oaklawn Park Race Track. Her connections then chose to skip the Kentucky Oaks. On May 16, 2014, trainer Todd Pletcher and owner Mike Repole decided to ship Stopchargingmaria to Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, to run in the second jewel of the de facto Filly Triple Crown, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Eleven three year-old fillies were entered, and Stopchargingmaria was made the second favorite at 7-2 behind stablemate Sloan Square at 3-1. In the one mile and one eighth race on dirt, Stopchargingmaria broke slowly and passed the stands for the first time in sixth place after one quarter mile. She was rated early moving into the clubhouse turn, then she was angled out four wide nearing the backstretch then closed in on the leaders and moved into fourth place rounding the final turn. Under hand urging by jockey Javier Castellano, she engaged frontrunning Vero Amore at the top of the lane and dueled outside of the leader throughout the stretch. then forged ahead in the final yards to win the Black-Eyed Susan by a neck in 1:51.79. On July 20, 2014, she won the Grade I Coaching Club American Oaks for her fifth win in nine starts. She outgunned Unbridled Forever and Miss Besilu to take the race by 2 1/2 lengths and was drawing away at the finish. On August 16, 2014, she won the Grade 1 $600,000 Alabama Stakes at Saratoga. Stopchargingmaria made her move on the far turn, turning away a challenge from Miss Besilu to stay on strong through the stretch. Joint Return made a late bid for second; Miss Besilu was third. The final time was 2:05.14. Stopchargingmaria was scheduled to meet the Kentucky Oaks winner Untapable in the Cotillion Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Parx on September 20 but was scratched from the race and appeared a week later in the Beldame Stakes against older fillies and mares. She started the 31/20 favourite but lost to the five-year-old Belle Gallantey by eight lengths.  Four-year-old season  In her four-year-old debut, Stopchargingmaria finished second in the Grade 1 Madison Stakes at Keeneland Race Course on April 4, 2015. The following month, she shipped to Pimlico Race Course, the site of one of her greatest victories in the 2014 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, and raced on the under card of that race in the Grade 3 $150,000 Allaire duPont Distaff Stakes. She was listed as the odds-on favorite in a field of twelve entries on May 15, 2015. Stopchargingmaria stumbled out of the gate and was fanned four wide on the final turn but finished first, driving home to win by four lengths. Stopchargingmaria and Untapable faced each other for the first time in the Grade 3 Shuvee Handicap on August 2, 2015. They broke next to each other, and it was a two-horse race from the start. Untapable set the pace, with Stopchargingmaria never more than a length behind her. Both fillies were stride for stride in the homestretch until Stopchargingmaria prevailed by a length over Untapable. In the Personal Ensign Stakes at the end of August, she was fourth behind Sheer Drama, Got Lucky, and Untapable. In the 2015 Breeders' Cup Distaff, ridden by Javier Castellano, Stopchargingmaria defeated Stellar Wind by a neck in a stretch run complicated by an objection from the second- place finisher because she bore out in the stretch, brushed Stellar Wind several times and pushed the other horse further to the outside. Pletcher stated that he felt the long layoff after the Personal Ensign was a major factor in her success, as \\"she runs her best races sometimes when she's fresh.\\"  Pedigree   References  Category:2011 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 11-g Category:Breeders' Cup Distaff winners ","title":"Stopchargingmaria"},{"id":"43105809","text":"Acropora gemmifera is a species of acroporid coral found in the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, the central Indo-Pacific, the southwest and northern Indian Ocean, southeastern Asia, Australia, the East China Sea, Japan, the oceanic central and western Pacific Ocean, and northwestern Hawaii.

Directed by James Ford Murphy and produced by Andrea Warren, it premiered at the Hiroshima International Animation Festival on June 14, 2014, and was theatrically released alongside Pixar's Inside Out, on June 19, 2015. The short is a musical love story that takes place over thousands of years. It is set to a song written by Murphy, and was inspired by the \\"isolated beauty of tropical islands and the explosive allure of ocean volcanoes.\\" In an interview with KHON, Murphy explained that his interest in Hawaii began 25 years prior while honeymooning on the main island of Hawai'i. Years later, he heard Israel Kamakawiwo ªole's rendition of \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\", which touched him. \\"I put together this fascination and love and this experience I had with my wife in Hawaii, with this feeling I had for this song and thought, wow, if I could blend those two things, it would be really‚Äîa film I would love to see.\\" The idea began to coalesce while attending the wedding of his sister, who married at the age of 43. \\"As my sister stood up on the altar, I thought about how happy she was and how long she'd waited for her very special day. There, at my sister‚Äôs wedding, I remembered Loihi and I had an epiphany... What if my sister was a volcano? And what if volcanoes spend their entire lives searching for love, like humans do?\\" Plot On a tropical island in the Pacific Ocean, a lonely volcano watches the wildlife creatures frolic with their mates and wishes to find one of his own. He sings a song (lava) to the ocean each day for thousands of years, gradually venting his lava and sinking into the water, but does not realize that an undersea female volcano has heard him every day and has fallen in love with him. She emerges on the day when that volcano becomes almost extinct, but her face is turned away and she cannot see him. He sinks fully into the ocean, heartbroken, but revives, full of lava when he hears her singing his song to him. His fire is re-ignited, he erupts back to the surface, this time right next to her, and the two form a single island where they are together, singing his song together. Cast *Kuana Torres Kahele as Uku, a lonely volcano searching for his true love.

Reception Nicholas Garrett gave the short a positive review; he said that \\"it is one of their most touching and subtle (shorts)\\". Oliver Lyttelton said that it was \\"beautiful\\". Pat Mullen gave the short 3 and a half stars out of 5, praising its \\"fantastic visuals\\" and its \\"overall originality and artistry\\". Nelson Rivera said \\"The story is told musically, which is always exciting, because music can really get to core emotions and Lava most certainly achieves this, almost effortlessly\\". However, Pablo Ruiz gave a negative review, describing its storytelling as \\"lazy\\" and arguing that \\"there's no character growth, no arc. There's no story. It's just things happening on screen.\\" Michael Colan ranked Lava as one of Pixar's weakest short films based on the writing, saying it has \\"too much telling, not enough showing\\". He praised the short film for its \\"gorgeous animation\\", however, and thought that it had a \\"good idea.\\" Song The song to the short, also titled \\"Lava\\", was released on June 16, 2015, as a digital single, and as a bonus track on the CD release of Inside Outs soundtrack.

Eclaircis par des figures, & propres √† etre joints aux diff√©rentes traductions de cet auteur. Avec Une description des machines militaires des anciens by W. Newton William Newton (1735‚Äì1790) was a British architect. Life Born on 27 October 1735, he was eldest son of James Newton, a cabinet-maker, of Holborn, London, and Susanna, daughter of Humphrey Ditton. Admitted to Christ's Hospital on 25 November 1743, he left, on 1 December 1750, to become apprentice to William Jones, architect, of King Street, London. In 1766 Newton travelled in Italy and spent some time in Rome. On his return he joined the Incorporated Society of Artists, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776‚Äì80. For many years he was mainly occupied in designing residences in London and vicinity. In 1775 he built a house for Sir John Borlase-Warren at Marlow, Buckinghamshire. He seems to have assisted William Jupp the elder in his design (1765‚Äì8) of the London Tavern, Bishopsgate Street Within, and to have been successful in the field interior decoration. Towards the end of 1781 James Stuart and his clerk of the works Robert Mylne fell out while working on Greenwich Hospital; and in September Stuart, then in ill-health, asked Newton to assist him with the designs for rebuilding Greenwich Chapel. Newton was appointed Stuart's assistant by the committee in February 1782, and later clerk of the works in succession to Mylne, an appointment confirmed by the board on 24 December 1782. From that time he produced nearly all the decorative ornamentation for Greenwich Chapel, and superintended its execution. Stuart died on 2 February 1788; but Newton brought the work to completion two years later, and carried out other works connected with the hospital. Unlike his earlier work, which was in the Palladian style, the Greenwich Chapel follows Greek models. In 1789 John Cooke and John Maule, in their Historical Account of Greenwich Hospital, gave Stuart sole credit for the chapel. Newton publicly declared that the credit of the design belonged to him, and detailed the small portion of the work designed by Stuart. Newton, himself in bad health, left Greenwich on a three months' leave of absence, for sea-bathing, on 10 February 1790, and died soon after, on 6 July following, at Sidford, near Sidmouth, Devon. Works In 1771 Newton published the earliest English translation of the first five books of Vitruvius, as De Architectura libri decem, written by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. In 1780 he issued, in French, Commentaires sur Vitruve, with many plates. The complete work of Vitruvius (including a translation of the remaining five books) was published after Newton's death in two volumes, 1791, by his brother and executor, James Newton. Of the plates, a few only were by William, the majority being by James. Newton also helped to complete and publish James Stuart's Antiquities of Athens, which appeared in 1787.

Description The object consists of a neutron star with a radius of about 12 km, which formed about 10,000‚Äì30,000 years ago in a supernova explosion. The explosion \\"kicked\\" the neutron star, which is now moving through space with a velocity of between 0.3 and 0.8% of the speed of light, faster than almost all other known runaway neutron stars. The pulsar is now about 60 light-years from the original supernova location. The neutron star is the source of a relativistic helical jet, which is observed in X-rays but has no detected radio signature. In the composite processed image (right) the neutron star pulsar is the point-like object with a pulsar wind nebula tail trailing behind it for about 3 light-years. The jet, aligned with the pulsar rotation axis, is perpendicular to the pulsar's trajectory and extends out over 37 light-years (about nine times the distance from our sun to the nearest visible star). The estimated velocity of the jet is about 80% of the speed of light. The star was initially presumed to be rapidly spinning but later measurements indicate that its spin rate is only 15.9 Hz. Long helical jet of Lighthouse nebula page 7 This rather slow spin rate and the fact that there is no evidence of accretion suggests that the jet is neither rotation nor accretion powered. A counter-jet (not shown in the image) has been detected, but is much fainter, possibly due to relativistic beaming. The origin of the glitch at about a third of the jet length is not known, but it might be due to the jet switching off and on or the jet orientation changing.

He produced work in a range of styles, but was often associated with colour field painting. Life Richard Smith was born in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. After national service with the Royal Air Force in Hong Kong, he studied at St Albans School of Art and later undertook post- graduate studies at the Royal College of Art in London from 1954 to 1957. From 1957 to 1958 he was a lecturer at Hammersmith College of Art. He was awarded a Harkness Fellowship in 1959 and travelled to America and spent several years there painting and teaching, with his first one-man show at the Green Gallery, New York, in 1961. In 1970 he was the British representative at the Venice Biennale and in 1975 a retrospective exhibition of his work was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London. He resettled permanently in New York in 1976. Work Smith's early work drew on packaging and advertising, which led to his being associated by some critics to the Pop Art movement. Smith stated that his work was \\"often physically related to hoardings or cinema screens which never present objects actual size; you could drown in a glass of beer, live in a semi-detached cigarette packet\\". However, his concerns were largely formal. His works from this period, such as Panatella (1961) can be seen as abstract works whose scale, handling of paint and use of colour show the influence of American colour field painters such as Mark Rothko and Sam Francis, and he tried to integrate their expressive painterly concerns with an exploration of the experience of mass culture. As an attempt to make a connection between 'high' art and popular culture Smith's work differs from the work of his British Pop contemporaries, who were more concerned with iconography. Smith stated that \\"My interest is not so much in the message as in the method\\" In 1963 Smith progressed to an examination of the two- dimensional nature of painting. In Vista he added a shaped extension to the rectangular canvas, and in works such as Piano and Giftwrap progressed to extending the surface of the painting out into three-dimensional space. Despite the three-dimensional element of these works, Smith insisted on their identity as paintings: saying \\"Since I have always retained a wall, there is no question of a multifaceted sculptural object\\" Smith never produced any free standing sculptures, preferring to challenge the conventions of painting by working in an area between painting and sculpture. In 1972 he exhibited the first of what are called the \\"kite paintings\\", in which rather than using a conventional stretcher the canvas is tensioned by cords and structures of aluminium tubing, which become an element in the composition of the works. This both reduced the strength of the edge of the canvas while at the same time drawing attention to its contour. Smith's new found interest in the edge of a picture is shown by the concentration of incident there in works such as 3 square 2. At this time Smith had returned from New York and was living in the English countryside, and his palette changed to more muted colours. The concerns of these works also appear in his small scale work of the time, where the paper was cut and folded, and often include elements fastened to the work by paperclips or pieces of knotted string. Works by Smith are in the collection of the Tate Gallery, London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

During his career he served as a Director of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, Curator of the Decorative Arts Department of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Assistant Director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and first Director of The Cloisters. Early life Joseph Henry Breck was born in Massachusetts in 1885. He attended Harvard University, where he majored in Art History. While at Harvard, he met and formed a lifelong friendship with Herbert Winlock, who would later become a Director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Breck wrote for the Harvard Lampoon, where his contributions revealed an interest in art. After graduation he traveled to Europe continuing his studies in art with specific interest in the Renaissance and sculpture. Upon returning to Harvard for graduate studies, Breck was encouraged by Winlock to join the Metropolitan Museum. Career In 1909 he was hired as Assistant Curator under Wilhelm Valentiner in the Department of Decorative Arts. In 1914, he left the Metropolitan Museum and was appointed Director of the recently established Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, where he was instrumental in the creation of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. He returned to the Metropolitan in 1917 as the Curator of the Decorative Arts department and Assistant Director of the Museum. The collections and scope of the Decorative Arts department so greatly expanded that after Breck‚Äôs death in 1933 it was divided into three departments: Renaissance and Modern Art, Medieval Art, and the American Wing.Miller, p.21Howe pp. 62-63. In 1932, Joseph Breck was named the first director of the new branch of the Metropolitan Museum, The Cloisters. Though he did not live to see the building completed, Breck worked intensely on the arrangement of its collections and the planning of the structure itself. In his obituary in The New York Times it was pointed out that he took it upon himself to make ‚Äúa study of further manuscripts and tapestries to find out what flowers were illustrated in Medieval times so that the new Cloisters‚Äô garden might reflect the Medieval spirit.\\"New York Times, 3 August 1933. Joseph Breck had a firm understanding and appreciation for not only design but how objects should be displayed. In 1912 at a meeting of the American Association of Museums held at the Metropolitan Museum, Breck, Museum Secretary Henry W. Kent and curator Durr Friedley set up cases and created displays demonstrating two methods: ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù. These installation guidelines which featured less crowding, good light, clear lines and glass display cases with muted backgrounds, became the standard for art museum installation. Breck wrote extensively on display and installation with the ‚Äúpurpose of benefitting both historical and visitor point of view.‚Äù Howe p. 138. Breck was associated with many exhibitions at the Museum, including the popular Industrial Arts Exhibitions. His philosophy was that by showing the public well-designed, everyday objects ‚Äì chairs, tables, curtains ‚Äì \\"good taste\\" could be taught. He stated that these ‚Äútouch a person more nearly and while a person may not be able to afford a good picture, that it is possible to purchase a good lamp by seeing these examples.‚Äù Miller, p.18. Though somewhat conservative in his taste, Breck displayed for the first time at the Metropolitan examples of Art Deco and Art Nouveau objects. His acquisitions as a curator were considered ‚Äúremarkably fine.‚Äù Miller, p. 14, 18. Breck wrote more than two hundred articles covering the fields of Renaissance art and sculpture, design of objects, and display and installation techniques. He was the author of catalogues for those subjects as well as on individual artists (such as Rodin), exhibitions (the Swedish exhibition) and collections (handbooks on J.P. Morgan & Ballard). He was also a frequent contributor to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin. Death and legacy In the summer of 1933, while on a buying trip for the Museum, Joseph Breck died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 48. Shortly before his death, he had been awarded the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur for his work in the arts. Considered by some to be a disciplinarian and rather tactless in his manner, Joseph Breck was by-passed by the Museum's Board of Trustees for the position of Director of the Metropolitan when it became vacant in 1931. The job went, instead, to his old friend Herbert Winlock. Museum President William Sloane Coffin wrote that Joseph Breck‚Äôs influence and taste was felt in all parts of the Museum: ‚ÄúThe Morgan Wing, the galleries on the second floor of Wings K and J, the galleries of medieval and Renaissance decorative arts, The Cloisters, and more recently the new hall of medieval tapestries are a standing testimony to his taste and knowledge in installation and arrangement.‚Äù Bulletin, 1933, p.147 Notes References *Howe, W.

Dolan's research has been funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Dolan has made outstanding contributions to our understanding of the development and evolution of land plant rooting systems. He was the first to define the precise cellular body plan of the Arabidopsis root and discovered the molecular genetic mechanism governing root hair cell differentiation. He demonstrated that this mechanism is ancient and was the first to discover the mechanism that controlled the development of the earliest land plant rooting systems that caused dramatic climate change over 400 million years ago. These pivotal discoveries illuminate our understanding of the interrelationships between the development of plants, their evolution and the Earth System.

Life  Since his youth he had pursued art as a hobby, but did not decide to become a sculptor until he was twenty-one. The occasion was a figure he made of the writer Karl von Holtei, which impressed Kaiser Wilhelm I so much that he bought it on the spot. In 1878 and 1879, Uechtritz travelled throughout Italy to see the old masters first hand. Upon his return, he began taking lessons in the studios of Carl Friedrich Echtermeier, a former Master Student of Ernst Julius H√§hnel. Later, he met H√§hnel and became his student. He completed his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, under Viktor Oskar Tilgner, who taught him how to make polychrome figures. His first work in that style (Piper with Monkey) was acquired by the National Gallery in 1889. He remained with Tilgner as an employee until 1887, when he opened his own studios in Berlin.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und die Siegesallee. R√©clame Royale. Reimer, Berlin 1998, His financial breakthrough came in 1897 with an allegorical figure group called Die Krone als Hort des Friedens (The Crown as a Haven of Peace), which fit in so well with the contemporary political propaganda that Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered it to be made in marble for the Herrenhaus. This work led to him receiving one of the coveted commissions for the Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project. The Kaiser was pleased with his contribution and appointed him a Professor in 1899. Although this monumental work made his reputation, lighter, more imaginative pieces, especially fountains, were his true forte. In 1907, he was one of the signatories on a letter addressed to Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow, stating that the market for art in Germany was oversaturated and suggesting that a greater effort be made to sell art in the United States, despite that country's preference for works in the French style. It is, perhaps, no coincidence that the American sculptor Harriet Whitney Frishmuth was one of his students at the time.  Selected major works  ; Berlin * 1898: Charlottenburg, \\"The Temple of Neptune\\", a waterfall and fountain with figures of Leda and the Swan, at the Berlin Zoo * 1899: Siegesallee Group 24, consisting of Georg Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg as the central figure; flanked by Konrad von Burgsdorff (1595-1652), Commandant of Spandau and K√ºstrin during the Thirty Years' War, and Adam, Count of Schwarzenberg. These figures were damaged during World War II and are currently on display at the Spandau Citadel. * 1904: Tiergarten, Gro√üer Stern, \\"Hubertusbrunnen\\" (Saint Hubertus Fountain) in the style of D√ºrer, central figure, with four hunting-related figures by other sculptors. The fountain was dismantled in 1938 during Hitler's efforts to redesign Berlin. The statue of Hubertus was lost or destroyed. The other figures were put back after the war, near the Gro√üer Stern. * 1910: Nikolsburger Platz, \\"G√§nselieselbrunnen\\" (Mother Goose Fountain), from a design completed just before his death. By the end of World War II, all the parts had been melted. In 1987, the Berliner Industriebank (now the Weberbank) presented the city with a faithful copy made by the sculptor Harald Haacke, who apparently specialized in producing replicas of lost works. ; Other cities * 1897: Landsberg an der Warthe, \\"Pauckschbrunnen\\", a gift to the city by industrialist Hermann Paucksch (1816-1899), a manufacturer of steam boilers. The original was destroyed during World War II. In 1997, it was replaced with a copy made by Polish sculptor . * 1904: St. Louis, statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, commissioned for display at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (World's Fair). Since 1968, a smaller version by an unknown sculptor has been in Tower Grove Park.St.Louis Public Library: Lasting Impressions (German-Americans in St.Louis) The fate of the original appears to be undocumented. * 1907: Wandsbek (Hamburg), \\"Puvogelbrunnen\\", named after Friedrich Puvogel (?-1907), a long-serving Vice-Mayor of Wandsbek, and donated by the Wandsbeker Beautification Association.

He is co-founder of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music (IASPM) and author of several influential books on popular music and music semiotics. Biography Tagg attended The Leys School in Cambridge in 1957‚Äì1962. He has mentioned his organ teacher, Ken Naylor, as particularly influential on his development as a musician and thinker.Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013, pp. 7, ff. He then studied Music at the University of Cambridge (1962‚Äì65), and thereafter Education at the University of Manchester (1965‚Äì66). Tagg had some success as a choral composer during these early years. For example, on Trinity Sunday 1963, Tagg‚Äôs anthem Duo Seraphim was performed at Matins by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge under David Willcocks. His Preces and Responses were also broadcast by the BBC from the Edington Festival in 1964. Tagg also worked as volunteer at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1963. During this period he also played piano in a Scottish country dance ensemble, as well as in two pop- rock/soul/R&B; bands. Dismayed at the prospect of becoming a music teacher in 1966,Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013, pp. 13‚Äì14. Tagg moved to Sweden where he taught English in Filipstad while running a youth clubSee, for example, Filipstads Tidningen, 13 July 1967. and playing keyboards in two local bands (1966‚Äì68). Deciding to retrain as a language teacher, Tagg then attended the University of G√∂teborg (1968‚Äì71), while also both singing in and arranging for G√∂teborgs Kammark√∂r. In 1969 he met Swedish musicologist Jan Ling who, realising that Tagg had experience in both the classical and popular spheres, asked him to help with the new music teacher training programme (S√ÑMUS) that the Swedish government had asked Ling to set up in G√∂teborg.‚ÄúThe G√∂teborg Connection: lessons in the history and politics of popular music education and research‚Äù, originally published in Popular Music, 17/2, 1998, 219‚Äì242. At S√ÑMUS (1971‚Äì77), and later at the Department of Musicology of the University of G√∂teborg (1977‚Äì91), Tagg taught (aural) Keyboard Accompaniment, Music Theory, and Music & Society. Problems encountered in this work provoked him to develop analysis methods addressing the specificities of structure and meaning in various types popular music, e.g. the ‚ÄúKojak thesis‚Äù (1979) and the reception tests at the basis of his book Ten Little Title Tunes (2003). Tagg was at this time also songwriter and keyboard player in the left-wing ‚Äúrock cabaret‚Äù band R√∂da Kapellet (1972‚Äì76). In June 1981 he co-organised, together with Gerard Kempers and David Horn, the first international conference on popular music studies in Amsterdam, as a result of which IASPM (International Association for the Study of Popular Music) was formed.For a basic history of IASPM's early days see \\"Proposals concerning the Establishment of an International Society for Popular Music\\" (1980) and the start of \\"Twenty Years After: Speech at Founder's Event, IASPM Conference, Turku, July 2001.\\" (Tagg, 2001). In April 1991, Tagg returned to the UK where he established the basis of what became EPMOW (Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World). In 1993 he was appointed Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Popular Music (IPM) of the University of Liverpool, where, until 2002, he taught such subjects as Popular Music Analysis, Music and the Moving Image and History of Popular Music. In 2000 Bob Clarida and Philip Tagg set up the Mass Media Music Scholars' Press (MMMSP) as a not-for-profit corporation registered in the state of New York. Its purpose is, using Fair Use legislation, to disseminate scholarly musicological writings on music in the mass media. Dismayed by the increasing rigidity of the UK's managerialist university system, Tagg moved once again in 2002, this time to take up a professorship at the Universit√© de Montr√©al where his main brief was to establish popular music studies in the university's Facult√© de musique (2002‚Äì2009). In January 2010 he returned as a pensioner to the UK, since when he has been writing books and producing his ‚Äúedutainment videos‚Äù. Tagg is currently Visiting Professor of Music at Leeds Beckett University and the University of Salford. He is also one of the main figures behind the foundation of the Network for the Inclusion of Music in Music Studies (NIMiMs) in January 2015. Semiotic music analysis Tagg is probably best known for his work in the field of music analysis. Using mainly pieces of popular music as analysis objects, he stresses the importance of non-notatable parameters of expression and of vernacular perception in understanding \\"how music communicates what to whom with what effect\\" in today's world. He has adapted Charles Seeger's notion of the museme to demonstrate how combinations of such units are used to create both syncritic (intensional) structures inside the extended present, and diatactical (extensional) ones over time.See chapters 11‚Äì12 in Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013. These combinatory structures can be understood, he argues, with the help of an overall sign typology consisting of anaphones (sonic, tactile, kinetic, social), style flags (style determinants, genre synecdoches, etc.) and episodic markers.See chapter 13 in Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013. The semiotic theory is basically Peircean but it draws also on Umberto Eco's theories of connotation.See chapter 5 in Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013, esp. pp. 158‚Äì171. The actual analysis method is based on both metamusical information about the analysis object (reception tests, opinions, ethnographic observation, etc.) to arrive at paramusical fields of connotation (PMFCs),See chapter 6 in Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013. and on intertextuality. The latter involves identifying sounds observed in the analysis object with sounds in other music ‚Äì interobjective comparison material (IOCM) ‚Äì and in connecting that IOCM with its own PMFCs.See chapter 7 in Philip Tagg, Music‚Äôs Meanings, 2013. Tagg argues that this sort of music semiotics is musogenic, not logogenic, i.e. suited to expression in music rather than in words, and that the combination of intersubjective and interobjective procedures can, inside a given cultural context, provide reliable insights into the mediation of meaning through music. Music theory reform In 2011 Tagg started working for the reform of music theory terminology on two fronts. His views are: [1] that conventional music theory terminology, based mainly on the euroclassical and jazz repertoires, is often both inaccurate and ethnocentric ‚Äì he cites the widespread use of ‚Äútonality‚Äù to denote just one type of tonality and its simultaneous conceptual opposition to both ‚Äúatonality‚Äù and ‚Äúmodality‚Äù as one example of the problem; [2] that the denotation of non-notated musical structures, rarely covered in conventional music theory, needs urgent attention. Awards In June 2014, Tagg received a Lifetime Recognition Award from the International Semiotics Institute at its conference in Kaunas, Lithuania. Selected bibliography * 1966.

It was written by the band's main songwriter, Ray Davies. Lyrics and Music In the song, the character Derek (who is featured in the story line of Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)) attempts to convince his father, Arthur, of the great opportunities available in Australia, where there's \\"no drug addiction\\" and you can \\"surf like they do in the U.S.A.\\" Derek's advertisement is compared to John Smith, who campaigned for America in a similar manner, by author Thomas Kitts. The song also features a jam sequence lasting for approximately half the song, which is atypical for The Kinks. This is probably the closest The Kinks ever came to a longer, loose and even slightly \\"spacey\\" jam on their records. This sequence also features a Wobble Board, an Australian instrument. In the Australian single edit, this section is removed by editing an earlier section of the song into another section during a drum beat, which is then followed by a fade-out.

Description  The bridge was designed by architect Angelo Vescovali and built between 1886 and 1890 in place of the partially destroyed, 2,200-year-old Pons Aemilius (also called Ponte Rotto, \\"Broken Bridge\\"). One arch of the ancient three-arch bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1598, while another arch was demolished by Vescovali in 1887 to make room for the Ponte Palatino, thus leaving the Pons Aemilius just a single arch in mid-river, situated adjacent to the modern bridge. Ponte Palatino takes its name from the Palatine Hill, at whose slopes the structure rises. The bridge links the Forum Boarium to Piazza Castellani, in front of the Tiber Island; the epithet English is due to the left-hand traffic flow that applies on it, just as in the United Kingdom. It shows five masonry piers with a metal top surface and is long.  Notes   Bibliography  * Category:Bridges in Rome Category:Bridges completed in 1890 Category:Rome R.

He was born into a Devonshire family, the son of Sir Nicholas Coote. In 1600 he moved to Ireland as a captain of the 100th Foot Regiment in the army of Lord Mountjoy, Lord Deputy of Ireland, where he fought in the last few years of the Nine Years War and was at the Siege of Kinsale in 1601‚Äì02 which ultimately led to the defeat of the O'Neills. In 1605 he was appointed Provost-Marshal of Connaught for life and in 1613 was appointed to the office of General Collector and Receiver of the King's Composition Money for Connaught, also for life. In 1620 he was promoted to vice-President of Connaught and made a baronet (of Castle Cuffe in Queen's County) the following year. He became a substantial landowner and served as a commissioner to examine and contest Irish land titles. In 1634 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Queen's County, again for life. He was elected Member of Parliament (M.P.) in the Parliament of Ireland for Queen's County in 1639. When the Irish Uprising of 1641 began, Coote was appointed Governor of Dublin and instructed to raise a regiment. He then marched south to secure Wicklow, marching north in 1642 to defeat the rebels at Swords and Kilsallaghan. In April 1642, he was ordered by James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde to relieve the beleaguered garrisons at Birr, Burris, and Knocknamease, after which he rejoined Ormonde's main force to defeat the Irish Confederates at the Battle of Kilrush in April, 1642. In early May of that year, he helped capture the garrisons of Philipstown and Trim, but was killed at Trim on 7 May 1642 during a Confederate counter-attack. He had married Dorothea, the daughter of Hugh Cuffe of Cuffe's Wood, and had 4 sons and a daughter. He was succeeded by his son Charles, who was made Earl of Mountrath. Another son Richard became Baron Coote of Coloony.

Later he formed his own atelier. Sources differ over the details of his birth and death. Personal life Point was born in Algiers, and died in either Naples, or Marlotte, Seine-et-Marne. Early career Point's earliest works were orientalist scenes of markets and musicians and the street life of his youth in Algeria. In 1888 he travelled to Paris where he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts under Auguste Herst and Fernand Cormon. He was linked to Numa Gillet. From 1890 he exhibited at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Move towards Idealism Primavera, Sandro Botticelli, c. 1482. Tempera on panel. Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Study for the head of Leda, Leonardo da Vinci, c. 1506-8. Royal Library, Windsor. Point was influenced by Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and was a member of the first Nabis group. In 1894 he made a trip to Italy with H√©l√®ne Linder (1867-1955) (later Mme Berthelot) where he saw Sandro Botticelli's Primavera for the first time outside of an engraving. The experience made a deep impression on him and he wrote that his eyes \\"first opened up\\" on seeing it, leading soon after to attempts to establish a movement in France to resurrect the art of the 15th and 16th centuries. The influence of Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci became evident in his work, for instance in the c. 1895 Eternal Chimera. H√©l√®ne Linder became an ideal female model for Point who often painted her in a Leonardesque style but dressed like a muse from Botticelli. Leonardo da Vinci's Study for the head of Leda (study for an original painting now lost) seems to have influenced the hair styles that he gave H√©l√®ne.Sciortino, Cassandra.

Soon, Point was moving towards fully fledged Symbolism. He made a determined effort to reject the modern world and the realism of Zola and Courbet. He adopted Rosicrucianism and became a friend of \\"S√¢r\\" Peladan. Edward Lucie-Smith described him as a \\"medievalizing painter ... whose style mingled the influence of Moreau with that of the Pre-Raphaelites\\".Lucie-Smith, Edward. (1972) Symbolist Art. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 115. From 1892 to 1896, Point exhibited at the Salon de la Rose+Croix and with L√©onard Sarluis he designed the poster for the fifth salon of that group. It depicted the Ideal in the form of Perseus holding the severed head of √âmile Zola in reference to the Greek myth in which Perseus decapitated the Gorgon Medusa. For the Symbolists, Zola exemplified in literature the oppressive Naturalism they rejected.Lucie-Smith, 1972, p. 54. Subjects at this time were usually mythological, such as his 1897 The Siren which included a typical Symbolist femme fatale figure luring men to their doom. Also in 1897, Point contributed an original lithograph titled the Golden Legend (Fr. L√©gende dor√©e) to the L'Estampe Moderne. The journal included four original prints in each issue and Point's was issued in Number 5, September 1897.

Atelier de Haute-Claire The highly ornate Coffret d'Oph√©lie (Ophelia Box) produced at Atelier de Haute-Claire. From 1896 to 1901 Point lived in Marlotte, where he founded the Atelier de Haute-Claire not far from the home of the Barbizon school. Around the turn of the century, the distinction between the fine and decorative arts was beginning to break down and Point became increasingly interested in the latter. He sought to emulate William Morris in revolting against nineteenth-century materialismLucie-Smith, 1972, p. 44. and produced applied art, including furniture, jewellery, fabrics, ceramics and wallpaper that harked back to the techniques and styles of the Middle Ages. Everything was hand-made to a very high standard of craftmanship in an effort to avoid the alienating effect of industrial mass production. As a result, however, the products of the atelier were luxury items that could only be purchased by an elite and the project therefore failed to meet one of its key objectives. The Symbolist journal L'Ermitage criticised the works of the Haute-Claire group for amounting to religious icons fit only for reverence in a case in a museum and having little to do with the France of today. One such ornate object was the Coffret d'Oph√©lie (Ophelia Box), a box in the form of a medieval reliquary, that referred to the Ophelia of Shakespeare much celebrated by the Pre-Raphelites. The box included bronze, cabochon, champlev√© enamelling, cloisonn√©, ivory, gold and other expensive materials and techniques.La colonie d'Haute-Claire: artisanat et nostalgie L‚ÄôHistoire par l‚Äôimage, 2014.

The number of different materials and processes involved in making each box meant that production was complex and a number of different craftsmen were required to make each one, for instance, noted ceramicist Charles Virion. Philippe Jullian described the products of the atelier as more Neo-Byzantine than art nouveau.Jullian, Philippe. (1973) The Symbolists. Translated by Mary Anne Stevens. London: Phaidon Press, p. 234.

The work consists primarily of an interview with two Israeli Jews, Chaja Florentin and Mimi Frons, about their ambivalent relationship to the city of their birth, Berlin. The first version of the film was completed and released in 2009 in Germany only; a second version of the film, fully revised for the international film market, was completed and released in 2013.  Plot  The Jewish protagonists in this documentary, so- called Yekkes, share memories of their childhood days in the Scheunenviertel and Berlin-Mitte, as they were growing up in the 1920s. They tell about their harrowing flight from Nazi Germany to Palestine in 1934. Chaja Florentin relates her experience of a subsequent return to postwar Germany to visit Berlin, which was very painful encounter for her. The emotional pinnacle of the film is reached with the joy and excitement that both women express when they are shown old historical photographs of the neighborhood streets where they grew up. To the final question in this filmed interview, of whether either woman would consider returning to Berlin for good, both answer with an emphatic no, stating on no uncertain terms that Israel is their home now. They express displeasure at many things in Israel, but they say that it is like a difficult child‚Äîone that cries all of the time, but one that you love unconditionally.  Background  The first version of Chaja & Mimi debuted on 6 February 2009 at the Directors Lounge film festival in Berlin, as an entry in the Memories category of the festival program. The film was reviewed by Sabrina Small for the Directors Lounge festival blog. The fully revised international version of the film premiered on 22 June 2013 at the Walter Benjamin Short Film Competition in Portbou, Spain. The film festival was supported by the Goethe-Institut of Barcelona. The interviews were conducted in the Caf√© Mersand in Tel Aviv, Israel, the favorite caf√© and regular haunt of the film‚Äôs protagonists. This Caf√© was founded in 1958 by a German emigrant to Israel, Walter Mersand; it was considered to be the main meeting place for Yekkes in Tel Aviv. The Anne Frank Center in Berlin has incorporated the film into its educational/informational work since 2011, within the framework of its project, Nicht in die Schult√ºte gelegt (What they forgot to put in your schoolbag). The project‚Äôs learning materials are designed for schoolchildren aged 10 and older. The project, like the film, Chaja & Mimi, encourages retrospection based upon the recollections of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.  Reception  The film was rated \\"especially valuable\\" (Pr√§dikat besonders wertvoll) by the German Film Quality Assessment Board (FBW) in the summer of 2013. The FBW's jury justified its rating with the observation that  Awards  * The movie was selected as Online Short of January 2020 by the Jewish Film Institute and was available for streaming on their website. * In June 2014, Chaja & Mimi was nominated for the ICCL Human Rights Film Award in Dublin, Ireland. * In May 2014, the film received an Award of Merit from the Best Short Awards in La Jolla, California, U.S.A. * Chaja & Mimi was voted third place by the viewing public in the movie theater, Cinemayence, on the occasion of the Langen Nacht des politischen Kurzfilms (Long night of political short films), organized by the Landeszentrale f√ºr Politische Bildung Rheinland-Pfalz, in Mayence, Germany, on 23 October 2013. * The German Film Quality Assessment Board (FBW) rated the movie with their highest Seal of Approval especially valuable; in addition the FBW named it Documentary Short Film of the Month for August 2013. * On 22 June 2013, the festival jury of the Walter Benjamin Short Film Competition in Portbou, Spain awarded the film second place.

A well known tourist attraction, a popular spot for cave swimming Further upstream is the Hokeb Ha Cave, with its large entrance carved from the summit of a hill where the Creek gurgles up from underground. Many Late Classic Maya ceramics have been found inside the cave, as well as an altar, and archaeologists believe the cave was used specifically for ceremonial purposes. The limestone caves are full of pristine crystal-clear mineral pools and lagoons, with a water temperature of a constant 75 degrees. Cave swimming trips are a popular activity (for safety, you must be accompanied by a guide and local guides can be hired in the village or at the Research Station). With life jackets and headlights you swim into the cave to visit one or more waterfalls, and view the impressive stalactites and stalagmites.

The game was made available for iOS and Android systems on July 10, 2014. Sonic Jump Fever is no longer available to download, being available to download on the Google Play Store as late as November 7, 2016. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to that of the previous Sonic Jump title. The objective of the game is to navigate a vertical course as high as possible. The player tilts their device to move the character left and right, and can tap the screen to perform a double jump. Hitting opponents from below destroys them and scores the player points. Unlike the original Sonic Jump, Fever focuses on competitive multiplayer. The game contains a leaderboard displayed before each round showing players the high scores of other players. These leaderboard scores reset twice a week to encourage competitive play. Reception Sonic Jump Fever received an aggregated review score of 54 on Metacritic, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Carter Dotson of Gamezebo gave the game a positive review, praising the game having a faster structure than Sonic Jump and the game's monetization, saying \\"the game is surprisingly good about the money it encourages players to spend\\" and that it can be played cheaply, while criticizing the game's repetitiveness though noting that the game was good to play in short periods, and complaining that the playable character can sometimes blend into the background. Pocket Gamers Harry Slater gave a negative review, saying that the game was not as fun as the original game, and that any part of the game that was not the jumping was unnecessary. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade was negative, complaining about the game's advertisements and the time it takes for the stage to change, noting that the game was worse than Sonic Jump, though praising the game's fever mechanic, graphics, and the speed of its gameplay.

Signum ‚Äì sign, signal) represents an international neo-avant-garde literal and art movement. It gathered wider support base both in former Yugoslavia and the world in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.\\"Signalism in lexicons\\" (entries from Yugoslav editions, in English), Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library≈Ωivkoviƒá, ≈Ωivan. \\"Quarter of century of Signalism\\", 1990.  The origins and methods of Signalism  The beginning of Signalism dates back to 1959 when its founder and main theoretician Miroljub TodoroviƒáMiroljub Todoroviƒá: Bio-bibliography, Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library started with his linguistic experiments. His main belief was that there can be no significant leap forward in poetry without revolutionizing its main medium ‚Äì the language.Daniel Daligand. Signalisme et pansemiotique (2007), Signalism @ Project Rastko, 2008P. Pet., \\"Signalizam\\", an entry in: Enciklopedija srpskog naroda, Belgrade, 2008, str. 1002; also: B.S-P-, Todoroviƒá Miroljub in: Enciklopedija srpskog naroda, Belgrade, 2008, str. 1133. The birth of Signalism in Serbian literature and culture, with its tendency to revolutionize other arts as well (visual, theater, comics,Branislav Miltojeviƒá. Antologija ni≈°kog stripa, Prosveta, Ni≈°, 2004, pp. 72, 265-268 music and movies),Pavle Levi. Cinema by Other Means, Oxford University Press, 2012, pp 98-104 came from the need to eliminate the spent models carried on by poetic and cultural traditions, as well as from the necessity to take on the challenges and spirit of the modern technological and electronic civilization. In its program (\\"Manifesto\\" and other guiding texts)Miroljub Todoroviƒá. Manifestos and other Essays (1969-1975) as well as in its art pieces, Signalism made a clean break from the principles of neoromantism and late symbolism still governing Serbian literature. Its goal was set to radically change poetry both through content and form, and make it compatible with the contemporary times. Revolutionizing of the poetic language started with the introduction of the symbols, formulas and linguistic forms of the \\"hard\\" sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, biochemistry and astronomy). Furthermore, the language was made visual by dispersing words and sentences into syllables and letters forming visually recognizable patterns,Adriano Spatola, Brendan W. Hennessey, Guy Bennett. Toward Total Poetry, Otis Books/Seismicity Editions, 2008, p. 60 as well as by introducing non-verbal symbols into the text (drawings, photographs, graphs.) for the purpose of creating a collage of verbal and visual elements.Prof. dr Dagmar Burkhart, ‚ÄûOd Carmina figurata ka vizuelnoj poeziji\\", Signal, Belgrade, no. 25-26-27, 2003, 3-10. This first phase of Signalism is often referred to as Scientism, with the most prominent examples including the books \\"Planeta\\" (Planet, 1965) and \\"Putovanje u Zvezdaliju\\" (A trip to Starland, 1971) as well as poetry cycles \\"Belanƒçevina\\" (Protein), \\"Kiseonik\\" (Oxygen), \\"O≈æili≈°te\\" (Nursery) and others in which the topics are Space, Time and Matter. In there for decade long research and creative pursuit that followed, Signalists significantly expanded cognitive boundaries and genre profile of modern Serbian poetry. Signalist poetry can be divided into two main forms: verbal and non-verbal. Verbal poetry consists of scientist, aleatoric (random), stochastic, technological, phenomenological, slang and apeironistic poetry. Non-verbal poetry subtypes include visual, object, sound and gestual poetry. Signalism made significant advances in prose (experimental novel and short story). There is also a number of significant Signalist children literature accomplishments. In visual art strides are made in body art, mail art,D≈æon Held. Mejl-Art signalizam, Knji≈æevni magazin, broj 91-92, Belgrade, 2009, pp. 8-9. performance and conceptual art. Three manifestos helped define Signalism as a neo-avant-garde movement that negates literal, artistic and cultural heritage, poetic and aesthetic conventions and canonical ways of creativity by insisting on creative experimentation ‚Äì \\"Manifesto of scientific poetry\\" (1968), \\"Signalist manifesto (Regulae poesis)\\" (1969) and \\"Signalism\\" (1970). The movement was significantly boosted by the international magazine \\"Signal\\", inaugurated in 1970. Nine issues of \\"Signal\\" appeared between 1970 and 1973, presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of \\"Signal\\" appeared. The new release of \\"Signal\\" revitalized the Signalist movement and brought an army of young artists into the movement in 21st century. On the work of Miroljub Todoroviƒá and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended:\\"Three dissertations about Signalism\\" (Biserka Rajƒçiƒá: 'Kornhauser's study'; Dragoljub P. ƒêuriƒá: 'Dissertation on Signalism'; Radovan Vuƒçkoviƒá: 'Radical disproval of tradition), Signalism @ Project Rastko Dr. Julian Kornhauser, Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland, 1980; Dr. ≈Ωivan ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Faculty of Philology in Belgrade, 1991 and Dr. Milivoje Pavloviƒá, University of Kosovska Mitrovica, 2002.

The most important authors and works of Signalism  Many poets, writers and painters accepted the basic concepts of Signalism, further developing and spreading the ideas of this Serbian (Yugoslav) neo-avant-garde movement. Besides the founder of Signalism Miroljub Todoroviƒá (Kyberno, 1970; The Pig is an Excellent Swimmer, 1971; Bumpkin Shows Off, slang poetry, 1974; Insect on the Temple, 1978; Algol, 1980, Textum, 1981; Chinese Erotism, 1983; Knock-Out, 1984; I Mount Rocinante Again, 1987; Water-Snake Drinks Water, 1988; The Diary of Avant-Garde, 1990; Electric Chair, slang poetry, 1998; I‚Äôve Just Opened my Mail, 2000; It Walked Into my Ear, slang stories, 2005; Blue Wind, 2006; Slang Stories, 2007;) important contributors to the theory and practice of Signalism include Marina Abramoviƒá, Vlada Stojiljkoviƒá, Zvonimir Kostiƒá Palanski, Slobodan Paviƒáeviƒá (Flowers‚Äô Silicates, 1973; Roadworks, 1984), Milivoje Pavloviƒá (White Book, 1974; The World In Signals, 1996), Zoran Popoviƒá, Ljubi≈°a Jociƒá (Moonshine in Tetrapack, 1975; What‚Äôs the Time, 1976: Essays on Signalism, 1994), Jaroslav Supek, Zvonko Sariƒá (Overcoat until the Dawn, 2001; Soul Catcher, 2003), Bogislav Markoviƒá (Altai Dust, 2006), Ilija Bakiƒá (Prenatal Life, 1997; New Babylon, 1998; Protoplasm, 2003; The Autumn of Gatherers, 2007; To be Continued, 2009), Slobodan ≈†keroviƒá (Indigo, 2005; All Colors of Arcturus, 2006; Chimera or Borg, 2008), ≈Ωarko ƒêuroviƒá (The World of Signalism, 2002), Du≈°an Vidakoviƒá, Dobrivoje Jevtiƒá, Dejan Bogojeviƒá, Andrej Ti≈°ma, Dobrica Kampereliƒá, Milivoj Anƒëelkoviƒá, Zoran Stefanoviƒá and others.  Critical reception  Numerous domestic and international critics and theoreticians hold Signalism in high regard: Prof. Milo≈° Bandiƒá: \\"Signalism is ‚Äì after Zenitism, Surrealism and the movement of social literature ‚Äì the next and autochthonous literary and artistic movement in Serbian literature of 20th century. At the same time, in contemporary Yugoslav literature and culture, Signalism is confirmed as an exclusive modern dimension and a separate artistic form and production. Without it all would probably be poorer and who knows how deprived.\\" Oskar Daviƒço, famous writer: \\"For the first time from the appearance of Surrealism in the twenties, we can joyfully confirm that with exploration of Miroljub Todoroviƒá, Serbian poetry can again catch up with the genuine worldwide avant- garde explorations.\\" Zoran Marku≈°, visual arts critic: \\"Signalism is our parallel phenomena within the brackets of the most extreme avant-garde and that explains its international expansion, approval and importance in certain artistic and intellectual circles.\\" Dave Oz, Canadian multimedia artist: \\"True essence of Signalism is that it expects appearance of planetary consciousness.\\" Gillo Dorfles, Italian arts theoretician: \\"Signalism means a step forward, in relation to concrete poetry, visual poetry and the art of the sign.\\" Prof. Milivoje Pavloviƒá: \\"Thanks to Miroljub Todoroviƒá and the group that follows him, Signalism with its mainstream represents the arc which connects in a creative manner avant-garde aims from the period between wars with the contemporary epoch, bringing valuable innovations and connecting Serbian art with the modern world‚Äôs processes.\\" (From the book The Keys of Signalist Poetics)  See also   References   Further reading  = Some works in English = * ≈†keroviƒá, Slobodan.

It was later fitted with a low power engine, making it probably the first powered glider. The 1923 motor glider in flight Design and development The Budig glider was a single seat biplane or sesquiplane of unequal span and chord with three forward surfaces supported on a pair of box section booms. The upper foreplane was claimed to provide automatic stability and carried an elevator behind it, though Flight remarked that \\"It is difficult, from the illustration, to make out exactly what this arrangement is supposed to do.\\" The pilot sat at the upper wing trailing edge, completely exposed at the front of a short central fuselage which supported a rectangular fin. The motor glider Foreplanes, nose and designer of the motor glider By 1923 a small, BMW horizontally opposed motorcycle engine had been added, mounted in pusher configuration behind the pilot who now sat at the leading edge of the upper wing behind a more substantial nose. It drove a very small diameter propeller. To accommodate the powerplant the central rear fuselage was replaced by rearward extensions of the booms, assisted by another, finer pair from the upper wings, which carried twin rectangular fins with a second elevator surface between them. Engine and propeller The little engine probably did not have enough power to get the Budig airborne but was used to maintain altitude or decrease the sink rate; launches were made with the usual bungee cord catapult. Nonetheless, Flight noted it as \\" probably the first glider with an auxiliary engine to fly\\".

Kalili was one of the first generation of Hawaiians to receive a western education by the American missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820. In 1836, he began his education at Lahainaluna Seminary with Kekaulahao and graduated after four years of education in 1840. Some of his classmates beside his cousin Kekaulahao included writer S. N.

In Europe, Hidden Cash did events in London, Madrid, and Berlin. Events typically consisted of the group hiding envelopes filled with money, most often between $50 to $100 in each, in various parks. In beaches in Southern California, from Los Angeles to San Diego, the group would hide money in Angry Birds toys or Pez dispensers.

The story follows the narrator, Clay, as he struggles for his own survival and traverses the United States as it collapses around him. Writing and development The Last Human developed out of a series of ideas Pieper had due to the Existentialism and Ancient Greek courses he was taking in college. However, the main influence came from the film V For Vendetta. The first chapter was turned in as a short story for his Existentialism class. Themes The story presents a highly realistic view of the near future and is told in a way where it feels like you know the narrator on a personal level. The book deals heavily with philosophical concepts, primarily those of freedom, empathy, morality, and power. These themes are prevalent throughout the story as choices have to be made, freedom must be chased and death must be thwarted as unchecked power devours the world. Predictions for the future The most frightening aspect of the story is that it is very relevant to today's world and the things occurring in it. Many of the horrible things that the story presents are currently happening in the world today. Examples include droughts, Russia and the United States playing games with Central Asia, flooding, and the rise of terrorism and biological warfare.

Life  He was the son of a laborer. After his primary education, he was apprenticed to the Bellis Brothers, a house painting and decoration firm, and received a master certificate in 1855. He later owned his own decorating company in Brussels. One of his employees there was the Greek painter P√©ricl√®s Pantazis, who became his lifelong friend, introducing him to the works of Gustave Courbet and √âdouard Manet and showing him the techniques of painting with the palette knife. In 1870, he went to Paris, where he came under the influence of the Barbizon school. His first exhibition was at Ghent in 1874, but his work was not well received by the critics. He didn't achieve a career breakthrough until 1880, when he participated in the Paris Salon.G√∂tz Czymmek: Guillaume Vogels und Emile Claus, zwei Belgische Impressionisten. Exhibition catalog, Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne, 1988 In 1884, he became a member of Les XX, a secessionist group. This led to a meeting with James Ensor. The two apparently travelled together on study tours to England and the Netherlands and some critics cite Vogels as a significant influence on Ensor. After Les XX was disbanded in 1893, he participated in the creation of a new group called La Libre Esth√©tique. He kept no written records and left his works undated, which makes it difficult to establish a chronology showing the development of his style. Some influence from the Old Masters seems to mark his later paintings, although many display a loose brushwork that appears to anticipate Expressionist techniques.

Sightings The first recorded sighting was in Orkney, in 1682. James Wallace, writing in about 1688, described a Finn-man in his \\"little Boat\\" at the south end of Eday being seen by the people of the island from the shore, and then fleeing swiftly when the islanders put out a boat to try and apprehend him. In 1684, a Finn-man seen at Westray was connected with the disappearance of fish from the area. A boat was captured in Orkney, and sent to the Physicians Hall in Edinburgh. Origins They were originally associated with Finland, although they were in fact Inuit from the Davis Straits, a fact recognised by Wallace. It was considered more probable that they could have travelled from Finland, Lapland, or another part of Europe, so the association persisted. Wallace's eldest son James added a note to a 1700 publication of his father's account, suggesting they had been driven to Scotland by storms. The most likely reason for their arrival is that they were escaped prisoners, having been taken by European ships as curiosities. Such was the concern about this practice that in 1720 the Staten Generaal of the Netherlands passed a law prohibiting the murder or kidnapping of Inuit. Description John Brand, in A Brief Description of Orkney, described a sighting of a Finn-man. =Artefacts= Kayaks belonging to Finn-men are preserved in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Mythology The Finn-men were grafted onto the existing mythologies that surrounded the selkies and Finfolk, to the point that both creatures may have both been the same in folklore. Their appearance was interpreted in terms of those traditions.  Related media  The history of the Finnmen is discussed in the Red Bull TV series Explorers in the episode \\"Journey of the Finnmen\\".

This type of anvil press is used in materials science and geology for the synthesis and study of solid phase materials under extreme pressure, as well as for the industrial production of valuable minerals, especially synthetic diamonds. These instruments allow the simultaneous compression and heating of millimeter size solid phase samples such as rocks, minerals, ceramics, glasses, composite materials, or metal alloys and are capable of reaching pressures above 25 GPa and temperatures exceeding 2500 ¬∞C. This allows mineral physicists and petrologists studying the Earth‚Äôs interior to experimentally reproduce the conditions found throughout the lithosphere and upper mantle, to a depth of 700 km (citation, figure 1,2). Diamond anvil cells and light-gas guns can access even higher pressures, but the multi-anvil apparatus can accommodate much larger samples, which simplifies sample preparation and improves the precision of measurements and the stability of the experimental parameters. History The 6-8 multi- anvil apparatus was introduced by Kawai and Endo(1970) using a split steel sphere suspended in pressurized oil, later modified to use the hydraulic ram. In 1990, Walker et al. simplified the first compression stage by introducing the removable hatbox design, allowing ordinary machine presses to be converted into multi-anvil systems. A variety of assembly designs have been introduced and standardized including the Walker castable, and the COMPRES assemblies. Recent advances have focused on in-situ measurements(link to next section), and standardizing materials and calibrations. Basic design A typical Kawai cell 8-6 multi-anvil apparatus uses air pumps to pressurize oil, which drives a vertical hydraulic ram to compress a cylindrical cavity known as a hatbox. This cavity is filled with six steel anvils, three facing and three facing down, that converge on a set of eight tungsten carbide cubes. The interior corners of these cubes truncated to fit an octahedral assembly. These octahedra range from 8 mm to 25 mm on edge and are typically composed of MgO or another material that deforms ductilely over the range of experimental conditions, to make sure the experiment is under hydrostatic stress. As this assembly is compressed, it extrudes out between the cubes, forming a gasket. A cylinder is drilled out between two opposite faces to accommodate the experiment. Experiments that require heating are surrounded by a cylindrical graphite or LaCrO3 cylinder furnace, which can produce considerable heat by electrical resistance (figure 4). However, the graphite furnace can be troublesome at higher pressures due to its tendency to transform into diamond. The DIA multi-anvil is the main alternative to the Kawai cell: it uses six anvils to compress a cubic sample. Theory In principle, the multi-anvil press is similar in design to a machine press except that it uses force magnification to amplify pressure by reducing the area over which force is applied: :P=F/A This is analogous to the mechanical advantage utilized by a lever, except the force is applied linearly, instead of angularly. For example, a typical multi-anvil could apply 9,806,650 N(equivalent to a load of 1000 t) onto a 10 mm octahedral assembly, which has a surface area of 346.41 mm2, to produce a pressure of 28.31 GPa inside the sample, while the pressure in the hydraulic ram is a mere 0.3 GPa. Therefore, using smaller assemblies can increase the pressure in the sample. The load that can be applied is limited by the compressive yield strength of the tungsten carbide cubes, especially for heated experiments. Even higher pressures, up to 90 GPa, have been achieved by using 14 mm sintered diamond cubes instead of tungsten carbide. Measurements in the multi-anvil Most sample analysis is conducted after the experiment is quenched and removed from the multi-anvil. However, it is also possible to perform measurements in-situ. Circuits, including thermocouples or pressure variable resistors, can be built into the assembly to accurately measure temperature and pressure. Acoustic interferometry can be used to measure seismic velocities through a material or to infer density of materials. Resistivity can be measured by complex impedance spectroscopy. Magnetic properties can be measured using amplified nuclear magnetic resonance in specially configured multi-anvils. The DIA multi-anvil design often includes diamond or sapphire windows built into the tungsten anvils to allow x-rays or neutrons to penetrate into the sample. This type of device gives researchers at synchrotron and neutron spallation sources the capacity to perform diffraction experiments to measure the structure of samples under extreme conditions. This is essential for observing unquenchable phases of matter because they are kinetically and thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures and pressure. Viscosity and density of high-pressure melts can be measured in-situ using the sink float method and neutron tomography. In this method a sample is implanted with objects, such platinum spheres, that have different density and neutron scattering properties compared to the material surrounding them, and the path of the object is tracked as it sinks, or floats, through the melt. Two objects with contrasting buoyancy can be used simultaneously to calculate the density. Applications Pressure, like temperature, is a basic thermodynamic parameter that influences the molecular structure, and thus the electrical, magnetic, thermal, optical and mechanical properties of materials. Devices like the multi-anvil apparatus allow us to observe the effect of high pressure on material structure and properties. Multi-anvil presses are occasionally used in industry to produce minerals of exceptional purity, size and quality, especially high-pressure high- temperature (HPHT) synthetic diamonds and c-Boron-Nitride. However, multi- anvils are high cost devices, and are very adaptable, so they more often used as scientific instruments. Multi-anvils have three main scientific uses: 1) to synthesize novel high-pressure material; 2) to change the phases of a material; 3) to examine the properties of materials at high pressures. In materials science this includes the synthesis of novel or useful materials with potential mechanical or electronic applications, such as high-pressure super conductors or ultra-hard substances. Geologists are primarily concerned with reproducing the conditions and materials found in the deep earth, to study geological processes that cannot be directly observed. Minerals or rocks are synthesized to find what conditions are responsible for different mineral phases and textures citation needed). Geoscientists also use multi-anvils to measure the kinetics of reactions, density, viscosity, compressibility, ionic diffusivity and thermal conductivity of rock under extreme conditions .

Having been articled to Henry Poston of Lombard Street, London in 1892, he remained with Poston as his assistant until he started an independent practice in London in 1905. From 1909, Trent specialised in cinema design. This led to his appointment first as the Chief Architect to Provincial Cinematograph Theatres (PCT), and then as architect to the Gaumont British Picture Corporation, which took over PCT in 1929. These cinemas included the Apollo Victoria Theatre and the Gaumont Finchley (1937) that he designed with the assistance of his son W. Sydney Trent and R. Golding.Gillies, Stewart & Pamela Taylor.

The group consists of rapper Daveed Diggs and producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes. History Diggs and Hutson met in grade school, and Hutson and Snipes were college roommates. The group began in 2009 as a remix project, with Hutson and Snipes taking a cappellas of mainstream rap artists and making power electronics and noise remixes of them to amuse themselves. Diggs joined in 2010 and began to write his own raps over their compositions. They self-released their first album, Midcity, on their website on February 5, 2013. Though their expectations were low, and despite minimal promotion, the album was well-received, and five months later, they signed to Sub Pop. Their second album, CLPPNG, was released on June 10, 2014. The group does not see their abrasive sound as a rejection of mainstream hip hop or reaction against it, but as part of a hip hop tradition including the likes of Dr. Dre and Public Enemy producers The Bomb Squad, who experimented with production and also used harsh, musique concr√®te-esque techniques in their music. Similarly, they think of themselves as a rap group rather than industrial-rap, noise-rap, or other mash-up genres. On June 14, 2016, they released an EP entitled Wriggle (EP). They then released their second studio album, Splendor & Misery, later on September 9. A science fiction concept album, Splendor & Misery was nominated for the 2017 Hugo Awards in the category of \\"Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)\\" on April 4, 2017. In 2017, the group released a single entitled \\"The Deep\\". The song was nominated for a Hugo Award in 2018, their second consecutive nomination in the \\"Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)\\" category. On August 14, 2019, the group released a lyric video to YouTube for a new song titled \\"Nothing Is Safe\\", which borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of 1970s and '80s horror films like Halloween, and the soundtrack works of John Carpenter. This was coupled with the announcement that their third full-length record, titled There Existed an Addiction to Blood would be released on October 18 of the same year. On September 12, 2019, a second lyric video was released to YouTube to promote There Existed an Addiction to Blood. The track, titled \\"La Mala Ordina\\" featured guest appearances from underground rappers Elcamino and Benny the Butcher, with additional production from noise artist The Rita. On October 3, 2019, a music video for the track \\"Blood of the Fang\\" was released to YouTube to promote There Existed an Addiction to Blood. On November 29, 2019, the band released a three song EP further exploring the world of The Deep. On June 19, 2020, they released the track \\"Chapter 319\\" on Bandcamp, along with a previously SoundCloud-only track \\"Knees on the Ground\\", with all proceeds from the sales donated to organizations dedicated to racial justice. \\"Chapter 319\\" was recorded during the protests after the killing of George Floyd, while \\"Knees on the Ground\\" was originally recorded after the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. On August 26, 2020 they announced their new album Visions of Bodies Being Burned, and released a new single \\"Say the Name\\" the same day. The new album is scheduled to be released October 23 of that year on Sub Pop Records. Style and influences The group has drawn comparisons to the likes of D√§lek, Death Grips, My Bloody Valentine, Tim Hecker and Shabazz Palaces. The Guardian described their sound as \\"the sort of shrill thrills you imagine could function as incidental soundtrack music for a documentary about abattoirs or might conceivably be the work of a young band intent on twisting industrial metal into brutal new shapes.

John Swete (d.1821) of the mill attached to the manor of Newnham. Devon Record Office 564M/F13/65 Newnham (since circa 1718Following death in 1718 of William Strode his heir was his nephew Sidney II Strode (1684-1721) who moved his residence from Old Newnham to Loughtor, see below Old Newnham) in the parish of Plympton St Mary in Devon is a historic estate long held by the Devonshire gentry family of Strode.Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp.718‚Äì20, pedigree of Strode of Newnham The ancient mansion house is situated 1 mile north-east of St Mary's Church, beside the Smallhanger Brook, a tributary of the Tory Brook, itself flowing into the River Plym. The house was abandoned by the Strode family in about 1700 when they built a new mansion on the site of Loughtor Manor House, about 1/3 mile to the north-east of Old Newnham. Monuments to the Strode family survive in St Mary's Church, Plympton, including the canopied stone effigy of Richard Strode (d.1464), showing a recumbent knight clad in armour. The mural monument of William II Strode (d.1637) and his family shows him kneeling with his two wives on either side and ten children below. The kneeling effigy mural monument to his daughter Ursula Strode, the wife of Sir John III Chichester of Hall, North Devon, survives in Bishop's Tawton Church. A notable member of this family and William II Strode's second son was the parliamentarian Sir William Strode (1594‚Äì1645), one of the Five Members whom King Charles I attempted to arrest in the House of Commons in 1642. In 1538 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Strode family purchased the demesne lands of Plympton PrioryPole, p.326 the second wealthiest monastery in Devon, and thus greatly expanded their estate. The Parliamentary Rotten Borough of Plympton Erle (abolished following the Reform Act of 1832) was controlled by the Strode family and the Treby family of Plympton House, and thus several Members of Parliament for the borough were members of these two families or were nominated by them. Descent of estate =de Plympton= According to the Devon historian Sir William Pole (d.1635) the descent of the estate of Newnham was as follows: *Simon de Plimton, in residence during the reign of King Edward I (1272‚Äì1307) *John de Plimton, in residence in 1314 =de Newenham= Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.494) *Simon de Newenham (son of John de Plimton), who took the surname de Newenham.

Early years Moller was born in Fort Worth, Texas on February 1, 1950, grew up in the South Hills section of Fort Worth, and attended R. L. Paschal High School. He studied meteorology at the University of Oklahoma (OU) where he earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He made a career as a forecaster at the National Weather Service (NWS). Storm prediction pioneer Moller was influential in developing the national Skywarn storm spotter training program, he produced, appeared in, and provided photography for its training film Tornadoes: A Spotter's Guide (1977) and its training video Storm Watch (1995), and he collaboratively developed the concept of the \\"integrated warning system\\". He was influential in developing new spotter training materials in the 1970s that were used nationally and he continued to refine training materials and techniques throughout his career. Moller intensively trained spotters in his NWS office area of responsibility in North Texas as well as around the country by way of frequent speaking engagements. Himself an amateur radio operator, he was enthusiastic at the ground truth information provided via amateur radio. Moller believed that storm chasing was important in providing field experience for spotter trainers as well for forecasting convective weather. He viewed chasing as an important avenue in providing imagery illustrating storm processes for spotter training and public preparedness. Moller passionately photographed storms and skyscapes, actively shared this imagery, and was also a noted nature and landscape photographer. Moller began chasing as a graduate student of OU and was a participant in the first organized scientific storm chasing projects, such as the NSSL/OU Tornado Intercept Project, in the early 1970s. He was a forecaster for Project VORTEX in 1994‚Äì1995. Moller participated in major pieces of media coverage regarding forecasting storms and storm spotting and chasing. He was an important contributor to Storm Track magazine and wrote or co-wrote dozens of scientific journal articles, conference papers, and monograph chapters. Moller was a fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). The Texas Severe Storms Association (TESSA) made a formal tribute to Moller upon his retirement and established the Alan R. Moller Severe Weather Education and Research Scholarship a few years prior to his death. Personal life Moller contracted early-onset Alzheimer's disease and died of complications thereof on June 19, 2014, aged 64. Moller enjoyed drag racing and fast cars, baseball, travel, western art, barbecue, and blues music.

Lamborghini's production facility and headquarters are located in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. Italian manufacturing magnate Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models were introduced in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coup√©, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and Ren√© Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980, who purchased the company for US$3 million, renaming it Nuova Automobili Lamborghini SpA. As CEO and President, Patrick Mimran invested heavily in the company's expansion, and was later credited as being the man who saved Lamborghini. Under his management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa entry-level sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle. Patrick Mimran sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987 for US$25 million. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and this increased productivity for the brand. 1963‚Äì1972 - Ferruccio Lamborghini =Early 1950s - Start-up and 350GT= The Lamborghini V12 engine, designed by Giotto Bizzarrini found its use in Lamborghini Automobiles for over 50 years Prior to founding his company, Lamborghini had commissioned the engineering firm Societ√† Autostar to design a V12 engine for use in his new cars. Lamborghini wanted the engine to have a similar displacement to Ferrari's 3-litre V12; however, he wanted the engine to be designed purely for road use, in contrast to the modified racing engines used by Ferrari in its road cars. Autostar was led by Giotto Bizzarrini, a member of the \\"Gang of Five\\" of Ferrari engineers, who had been responsible for creating the famous Ferrari 250 GTO, but left the company in 1961 after founder Enzo Ferrari announced his intention to reorganise the engineering staff. The engine Bizzarrini designed, known today as the Lamborghini V12, had a displacement of 3.5 litres, a 9.5:1 compression ratio, and a maximum output of at 9,800 rpm. Lamborghini was displeased with the engine's high revolutions and dry-sump lubrication system, both characteristic of the racing engines he specifically did not wish to use; when Bizzarrini refused to change the engine's design to make it more \\"well-mannered\\", Lamborghini refused to pay the agreed-upon fee of 4.5 million Italian lire (plus a bonus for every unit of brake horsepower the engine could produce over the equivalent Ferrari engine). Lamborghini did not fully compensate the designer until ordered to do so by the courts, a terrific irony considering variants of Bizzarrini's V12 design were used by Lamborghini automobiles for nearly half a century, from 1963 to 2010. The first Lamborghini chassis design was penned by Italian Gian Paolo Dallara of Ferrari and Maserati fame, together with a team that included Paolo Stanzani, then a recent college graduate and Bob Wallace, a New Zealander who was known at Maserati for his keen sense of chassis handling and excellent feedback and developmental skills. The body was styled by the then-relatively unknown designer Franco Scaglione, who was selected by Ferruccio Lamborghini after passing over highly regarded names including Vignale, Ghia, Bertone, and Pininfarina. The design penned by Franco Scaglione of the 350GTV was not very well received hence necessitating a redesign Lamborghini designed and built the 350GTV in only four months, in time for an October unveiling at the 1963 Turin Motor Show. Due to the ongoing disagreement with engine designer Giotto Bizzarrini, a working powerplant was not available for the prototype car in time for the show. The car went on display in Turin without an engine under its hood; according to lore, Ferruccio Lamborghini had the engine bay filled with bricks so that the car would sit at an appropriate height above the ground, and made sure that the bonnet stayed closed to hide the missing engine. The motoring press gave the 350GTV a warm response. Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. was officially incorporated on 30 October 1963. Ferruccio Lamborghini purchased a property at Via Modena, 12, in the township of Sant'Agata Bolognese, less than from Cento. This location was close to the centre of Italy's automobile industry and provided easy access to skilled labour and facilities. The township was chosen as the location for the factory due to a favorable financial agreement with the city's communist leadership, who promised Lamborghini a 19% interest rate on the company's profits when deposited in the bank, in addition to charging zero tax on the profits. As part of the agreement, the factory would be required to unionise its workers. Carrozzeria Touring re-designed the body of the 350 GTV prototype for Lamborghini's first production vehicle, the 350 GT Despite the favorable press reviews of the 350GTV, Ferruccio Lamborghini decided to rework the car for production as the design did not receive a much greater response from the general public. The production model, which would be called the 350GT, was restyled by Carrozzeria Touring of Milan, and a new chassis was constructed in-house. Bizzarrini's V12 engine would be detuned for mass production, rated at rather than the designer's intended . The completed design debuted at the 1964 Geneva Motor Show, once again garnering positive reviews from the press. Production began shortly afterwards, and by the end of the year, cars had been built for 13 customers; Lamborghini sold each car at a loss in order to keep prices competitive with Ferrari's. The 350GT remained in production for a further two years, with a total of 120 cars sold. =1965‚Äì1966 - 400GT and Miura= The 400GT had the enlarged 3.9-litre V12 engine The 400GT (2+2) was introduced in 1967, becoming the company's first four-seater model In 1965, Gian Paolo Dallara made improvements to the Bizzarrini V12, increasing its displacement to 3.9 litres, and its power output to at 6,500 rpm. The engine was first installed in the 400GT, essentially a 350GT with a larger engine. At the 1966 Geneva Auto Show, Lamborghini introduced the 400GT (2+2), a stretched revision of the 350GT/400GT that had 2+2 seating and other minor updates. The 400GT 2+2, like its predecessors, was well received by the motoring press. The revenue from sales of the 2+2 allowed Lamborghini to increase the labour force at his factory to 170 employees, and expand services offered to customers. During 1965, Dallara, Stanzani, and Wallace invested their personal time into the development of a prototype car that they envisioned as a road car with racing pedigree, capable of winning on the track as well as being driven on the road by enthusiasts. They hoped to sway Ferruccio Lamborghini away from the opinion that such a car would be too expensive and distract from the company's focus. When finally brought aboard, Lamborghini allowed his engineers to go ahead, deciding that the car, known internally as the P400, would be useful as a potential marketing tool, if nothing more. The P400 rolling chassis, having a transverse mid-engine layout was displayed at the 1965 Turin Motor Show The car's rolling chassis, featuring an unusual transversely mounted mid-engine layout, was displayed at the Turin Salon in 1965, impressing showgoers. A version with bodywork styled by Bertone designer Marcello Gandini was finished only days before its debut at the 1966 Geneva motor show. As had happened three years earlier at the debut of the 350GTV, an ill-fitting engine meant the prototype's engine bay was filled with ballast, and the engine compartment was kept locked. The favorable reaction to the P400 at Geneva led Lamborghini to slate the car for production by 1967, under the name Miura. The Miura's layout and styling would become the standard for mid- engine two-seat high-performance sports cars,Top Gear Episode 4, spoken by Richard Hammond. a trend that continues today. The Miura (P400) was added to the Lamborghini line-up in 1967 Lamborghini now had an offering that positioned the fledgling automaker as a leader in the world of sports cars, while the 400GT was the sophisticated road car that Ferruccio Lamborghini had long desired to build. By end of 1966, the workforce at the Sant'Agata factory had expanded to 300, and enough deposits were made by prospective buyers to begin the final development of the Miura in 1967. The first four cars produced were kept at the factory, where Bob Wallace continued to improve and refine the car. By December, 108 cars had been delivered. =1967‚Äì1968 - Islero replaces 400GT, Stanzani replaces Dallara= The design penned by Touring for the successor to the 400GT did not gain Lamborghini's approval The design interpretation of the 400GT's successor crafted by Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini was also rejected Production of the 400GT continued, with Ferruccio Lamborghini seeking to replace the four-year-old design. Lamborghini commissioned Touring, which had styled the 350GT and the 400GT, to design a possible replacement based on the same chassis. Touring's 400 GT Flying Star II did not win Lamborghini's approval. Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini, of Neri and Bonacini coachbuilders in Modena, produced their own design, the 400GT Monza, which was rejected as well. Facing mounting financial difficulties, Touring would close its doors later that year. The Islero was a sales disappointment, but faithful to Ferruccio's ideal of a reliable grand tourer Ferruccio Lamborghini turned to Bertone designer Mario Marazzi, who had formerly worked at Touring. Together with Lamborghini's engineers, he developed a four-seater concept named the Marzal. The car rode on a stretched version of the P400 chassis and was powered by an in-line six-cylinder engine that was made from one-half of Lamborghini's V12 design. Despite an innovative design that featured gullwing doors and enormous glass windows, Lamborghini rejected the design. Eventually, a toned-down version became the Islero 400GT. While the car was not the full four-seater that he desired, Ferruccio Lamborghini thought the car represented a well-developed gran turismo product. It failed to attract buyers, with only 125 cars produced between 1968 and 1969. The Miura P400S introduced in 1968, had a stiffened chassis and an upgraded engine The Miura roadster introduced at the 1968 Brussels Motor Show failed to reach production stage New versions of the Miura arrived in 1968; the Miura P400 S (more commonly known as the Miura S) had a stiffened chassis and more power, with the V12 engine now developing at 7,000 rpm. At the 1968 Brussels auto show, the automaker unveiled the Miura P400 Roadster (more commonly called the Miura Spider), an open-top version of the coup√©. Gandini, by now effectively the head of design at Bertone, had paid great attention to the details, particularly the problems of wind buffeting and noise insulation inherent to a roadster. For all of Gandini's hard work, sales manager Ubaldo Sgarzi was forced to turn potential buyers away, as Lamborghini and Bertone were unable to reach a consensus on the size of a theoretical roadster production run. The one-off Miura Spider was sold off to an American metal alloy supplier, who wanted to use it as a marketing device. 1968 was a positive time for all of Ferruccio's businesses, and Automobili delivered 353 cars over the course of the year. In August 1968, Gian Paolo Dallara, frustrated with Ferruccio Lamborghini's refusal to participate in motorsport, was recruited away from Sant'Agata to head the Formula One programme at rival automaker De Tomaso in Modena. With profits on the rise, a racing programme would have been a possibility, but Lamborghini remained against even the construction of prototypes, stating his mission as: \\"I wish to build GT cars without defects ‚Äì quite normal, conventional but perfect ‚Äì not a technical bomb.\\" With cars like the 400GT and the Islero, his aim to establish himself and his cars as equal or superior to the works of Enzo Ferrari had been satisfied. Dallara's assistant, Paolo Stanzani, replaced him as technical director. =1969 - Espada and union trouble= The Espada was Lamborghini's first truly popular model, with more than 1,200 units sold during its ten years of production Bertone was able to persuade Lamborghini to allow them to design a brand-new four-seater. The shape was penned by Marcello Gandini, and a bodyshell was delivered to Ferruccio for inspection. The businessman was less than pleased with the enormous gullwing doors that Gandini had included, and insisted that the car should have conventional doors instead. The car that resulted from the collaboration was debuted at the 1969 Geneva show with the name Espada, powered by a 3.9-litre, front-mounted evolution of the factory's V12, generating a power output of . The Espada was a success, with a total production run of 1,217 cars over ten years of production. In 1969, Automobili Lamborghini encountered problems with its fully unionised work force, among which the machinists and fabricators had begun to take one-hour token stoppages as part of a national campaign due to strained relations between the metal workers' union and the Italian industry. Ferruccio Lamborghini, who often rolled up his sleeves and joined in the work on the factory floor, was able to motivate his staff to continue working towards their common goal despite the disruptions. The Jarama was a shortened, sportier version of the Espada developed to replace the unsuccessful Islero Throughout that year, Lamborghini's product range, then consisting of the Islero, the Espada, and the Miura S, received upgrades across the board, with the Miura receiving a power boost, the Islero being upgraded to the \\"S\\" trim, and the Espada gaining comfort and performance upgrades, which allowed it to reach speeds of up to . The Islero was slated to be replaced by a shortened yet higher-performing version of the Espada, the Jarama 400GT. The 3.9-litre V12 was retained, its compression ratio increasing to 10.5:1. =1970‚Äì1971 - Jarama, Urraco, prototype Countach, and financial woes= The Urraco was the first clean-sheet Lamborghini design since the 350GTV The Urraco was the first V8 powered Lamborghini production car By the time the Jarama was unveiled at the 1970 Geneva Motor Show, Paolo Stanzani was at work on a new clean-sheet design, which would use no parts from previous Lamborghini cars. Changes in tax laws and a desire to make full use of the factory's manufacturing capacity meant that the Italian automaker would follow the direction taken by Ferrari, with its Dino 246 and Porsche, with its 911, and produce a smaller, V8-powered 2+2 car, the Urraco. The 2+2 body style was selected as a concession to practicality, with Ferruccio acknowledging that Urraco owners might have children. The single overhead cam V8 designed by Stanzani generated a power output of at 5,000 rpm. Bob Wallace immediately began road testing and development; the car was to be presented at the 1970 Turin motor show. The Miura SV was the final evolution of the Miura P400 In 1970, Lamborghini began development of a replacement for the Miura, which was a pioneering model, but had interior noise levels that Ferruccio Lamborghini found unacceptable and nonconforming to his brand philosophy. Engineers designed a new, longer chassis that placed the engine longitudinally, further away from the driver's seat. Designated the LP 500 for its 4.97-litre version of the company's V12, the prototype's body was styled by Marcello Gandini at Bertone. The car was presented at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show, alongside the final revision of the Miura, the P400 SuperVeloce. Completing the Lamborghini range were the Espada 2, the Urraco P250, and the Jarama GT. As a world financial crisis began to take hold, Ferruccio Lamborghini's companies began to run into financial difficulties. In 1971, Lamborghini's tractor company, which exported around half of its production, ran into difficulties. Cento, Trattori's South African importer, cancelled all its orders. After staging a successful coup d'√©tat, the new military government of Bolivia cancelled a large order of tractors that was partially ready to ship from Genoa. Trattori's employees, like Automobili's, were unionised and could not be laid off. In 1972, Lamborghini sold his entire holding in Trattori to SAME, another tractor builder. =1972 - Ferruccio sells control of the company= The entire Lamborghini group was now finding itself in financial troubles. Development at the automaker slowed; the production version of the LP 500 missed the 1972 Geneva Show, and only the P400 GTS version of the Jarama was on display. Faced with a need to cut costs, Paolo Stanzani set aside the LP 500's powerplant, slating a smaller, 4-litre engine for production. Ferruccio Lamborghini began courting buyers for Automobili; he entered negotiations with Georges-Henri Rossetti, a wealthy Swiss businessman and friend of Ferruccio's, as well as the owner of an Islero and an Espada. Ferruccio sold Rossetti 51% of the company for US$600,000, thereby relinquishing control of the automaker he had founded. He continued to work at the Sant'Agata factory; Rossetti rarely involved himself in Automobili's affairs. 1973‚Äì1977 - Rossetti The 1973 oil crisis plagued the sales of high performance cars from manufacturers around the world; the rising price of oil caused governments to mandate new fuel economy laws, and consumers to seek smaller, more practical modes of transportation. Sales of Lamborghini's exotic sports cars, propelled by high-powered engines with high fuel consumption, suffered. The political unrest in late-seventies Italy was also a contributing factor, with the domestic market collapsing as well-heeled customers chose less ostentatious cars after a number of high-profile kidnappings and assassinations. In 1974, Ferruccio Lamborghini sold his remaining 49% stake in Lamborghini Automobili to Ren√© Leimer, a friend of Georges-Henri Rossetti. Having severed all connections with the cars and tractors that bore his name, Lamborghini retired to an estate on the shores of Lake Trasimeno, in the province of Perugia in central Italy, where he would remain until his death. The Countach, which replaced the Espada as Lamborghini's best-selling car, was in production from 1974 to 1988 The Silhouette, introduced in 1971 proved to be a sales disaster due to its poor build quality The car shown as the LP 500 in 1971 entered production in 1974 as the Countach LP 400, powered by a smaller, 4.0-litre V12. The first production model was delivered in 1974. In 1976, the Urraco P300 was reworked into the Silhouette, featuring a targa top and a 3.0-litre V8. Its build quality, reliability, and ergonomics all worked against it, as did the fact that it could only be imported into the U.S. via the \\"grey market\\". Only 54 were produced. The Countach was also hampered by its lack of direct participation in the American market until the LP 500S version, introduced in 1982. At the 1977 Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled its first prototype military vehicle, the \\"Cheetah\\", powered by a rear-mounted Chrysler V8 engine. However, the only prototype was not destroyed during testing as rumoured, but performed poorly and as such lost the contract. The resources used to develop the Cheetah were diverted from the BMW M1 which ultimately led to the cancellation of the contract from BMW. 1978‚Äì1986 - Bankruptcy and Mimran The Jalpa, an update of the failed Silhouette, was the only new car introduced during receivership The Countach LP500 S was the first Countach variant to be officially sold in the U.S. As the years passed, Lamborghini's situation worsened; the company entered bankruptcy in 1978, and the Italian courts took control. In 1980, the Swiss brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran, famed food entrepreneurs with a passion for sports cars, were appointed to administer the company during its receivership. During administration, the automaker reworked the failed Silhouette into the Jalpa, which was powered by a 3.5-litre V8 that had been modified by former Maserati great, Giulio Alfieri. More successful than the Silhouette, the Jalpa came closer to achieving the goal of a more affordable, livable version of the Countach. The Countach was also updated, finally allowing it to be sold in the U.S. with the introduction of the LP 500S model in 1982. By 1980, the company was officially in the hands of the Patrick Mimran as CEO. He began a comprehensive restructuring programme, injecting large amounts of capital into the floundering automaker. The Sant'Agata facilities were rehabilitated, and a worldwide hiring campaign to find new engineering and design talent began in earnest. The LM002 sport-utility vehicle was introduced under Mimran ownership The immediate results of the investment were good. The Countach LP 5000 Quattrovalvole, whose engine generated a power output of , was introduced in 1984; further work on the failed Cheetah project resulted in the introduction of the LM002 sport utility vehicle in 1986. The company, looking towards the foreseeable future, displayed the Countach Evoluzione, a prototype sports car almost completely made of carbon fibre, to the international press in 1987. The Evoluzione was shown during its testing schedule, which ended with its destruction in a crash test. In 1987, Patrick Mimran decided to sell the company to Chrysler Corporation. 1987‚Äì1993 - Chrysler On 24 April 1987, in an acquisition spearheaded by Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, Chrysler Corporation took control of Nuova Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A., paying US$25.2 million to the Mimrans.Jolliffe and Willard state that Chrysler Corporation acquired Lamborghini for US$25.2 million; Holusha reports a figure closer to US$25 million. The Mimran brothers were the only owners of Lamborghini to ever make money owning the company at the time, having sold it for many times the dollar amount they paid for it six years earlier. Viper V10 engine used in the Dodge Viper under the Chrysler ownership Iacocca, who had previously orchestrated a near-miraculous turnaround of Chrysler after the company nearly fell into bankruptcy, carried out his decision to purchase Lamborghini with no challenges from the board of directors. Chrysler executives were appointed to Lamborghini's board, but many of Lamborghini's key members remained in managing positions, including Alfieri, Marmiroli, Venturelli, Ceccarani and Ubaldo Sgarzi, who continued in his role as head of the sales department. To begin its revival, Lamborghini received a cash injection of US$50 million from its new owner. Chrysler was interested in entering the \\"extra premium\\" sports car market, which Chrysler estimated at about 5,000 cars per year, worldwide. Chrysler aimed to produce a car to compete with the Ferrari 328 by 1991, and also wanted the Italians to produce an engine that could be used in a Chrysler car for the American market. Forghieri designed a V12 engine for Lamborghini's Formula 1 venture Chrysler made the decision to take the company into motorsport for the first time; the effort to develop engines for Grand Prix teams would be known as Lamborghini Engineering S.p.A. The new division was based in Modena, and was given an initial budget of US$5 million. Danielle Audetto was chosen to be the manager and Emile Novaro the president; their first recruit was Mauro Forghieri, a man with a stellar reputation in the world of motorsport, who had formerly managed Ferrari's Formula 1 team. Forghieri set about designing a 3.5-litre V12 engine, independent of road-car engine design undertaken at Sant'Agata. The 25th Anniversary Edition introduced in 1988 was the final evolution of the aging Countach At the time, Lamborghini was working on a successor to the Countach, the Diablo. The Diablo's original design had been penned by Marcello Gandini, the veteran who had penned the exterior appearances of the Miura and the Countach while working for coachbuilder Bertone. However, Chrysler executives, unimpressed with Gandini's work, commissioned the American car- maker's own design team led by Tom Gale to execute a third extensive redesign of the car's body, smoothing out the trademark sharp edges and corners of Gandini's original design; Gandini was unimpressed with the finished product. The Diablo had been intended for introduction in time for September 1988, when Lamborghini would celebrate its 25th anniversary; once it was clear that mark would be missed, a final version of the Countach was rushed into production instead. By the end of 1987, Emile Novaro had returned from his long recovery, and used his authority to halt Chrysler's increasing interference in the development of the Diablo. Much to the chagrin of the Fighting Bull, Chrysler exhibited a four-door concept car at the Frankfurt Auto Show, badged as a 'Chrysler powered by Lamborghini'. The Portofino was poorly received by the motoring press and Lamborghini's employees alike, but it went on to become the inspiration for the Dodge Intrepid sedan. The P140 project was started to replace the Jalpa In April 1988, the Bertone Genesis, a Quattrovalvole V12-powered, Lamborghini-branded vehicle resembling a minivan was debuted at the Turin motor show. The unusual car, intended to gauge public reactions, was abandoned, a misfit in both Lamborghini's and Chrysler's product ranges. The Genesis had been commissioned alongside the new \\"baby Lambo\\" that would replace the Jalpa, occupying the then-empty space below the Diablo in Lamborghini's lineup. The project had been allocated a $25 million budget, with the prospect of selling more than 2,000 cars per year. The Diablo was the fastest car in production when it was introduced in 1990 The Diablo was unveiled to the public on 21 January 1990, at an event at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo. The Diablo was the fastest car in production in the world at the time, and sales were so brisk that Lamborghini began to turn a profit. The company's U.S. presence had previously consisted of a loosely affiliated and disorganized private dealer network; Chrysler established an efficient franchise with full service and spare parts support. The company also began to develop its V12 engines for powerboat racing. Profits increased past the $1 million mark in 1991, and Lamborghini enjoyed a positive era. The uptick in fortunes was to be brief; in 1992, sales crashed, as the US$239,000 Diablo proved ultimately to be inaccessible to American enthusiasts. With Lamborghini bleeding money, Chrysler decided that the automaker was no longer producing enough cars to justify its investment. 1994‚Äì1997 - Indonesian and Malaysian Ownership Setiawan Djody also owned sports car maker Vector and hoped that Lamborghini and Vector would collaborate to the benefit of both companies. The Vector M12 pictured here has a Lamborghini V12 engine and is based on the Diablo Chrysler began looking for someone to take Lamborghini off its hands, and found it in a holding company called MegaTech. The company was registered in Bermuda and wholly owned by Indonesian conglomerate SEDTCO Pty., headed by businessmen Setiawan Djody and Tommy Suharto, the youngest son of then- Indonesian President Suharto. By February 1994, after US$40 million had changed hands, Lamborghini had left American ownership, and MegaTech took over the automaker, its Modena racing engine factory, and the American dealer interest, Lamborghini USA. Djody, who also owned a 35% stake in troubled American sports car manufacturer Vector Motors, thought Vector and Lamborghini might be able to collaborate to improve their output. Michael J. Kimberly, formerly of Lotus, Jaguar and executive vice-president of General Motors, was appointed president and managing director. After reviewing the entire Lamborghini operation, Kimberly concluded that the company needed to expand its offerings from more than just one or two models, and provide a car accessible to American car enthusiasts. He implemented a marketing strategy to raise awareness of Lamborghini's heritage and mystique. In 1995, Lamborghini produced a hit, when the Diablo was updated to the top-end SuperVeloce model. But in 1995, even as sales were climbing, the company was restructured, with Tommy Suharto's V'Power Corporation holding a 60% interest, MyCom Bhd., a Malaysian company controlled by Jeff Yap, holding the other 40%. The Diablo would be Lamborghini's mainstay throughout the '90s; it was continually updated throughout the various changes in ownership Never leaving the red despite its increase in sales, in November 1996 Lamborghini hired Vittorio di Capua as president and CEO, hoping that the veteran of more than 40 years at auto giant Fiat S.p.A. could finally make the sports car maker profitable again. Di Capua immediately launched cost-cutting measures, letting go of a number of company executives and consultants, and overhauling production in order to achieve a 50 percent gain in productivity. In 1997, Lamborghini finally passed its break-even point, selling 209 cars, thirteen more than it needed to be profitable. Di Capua also leveraged the Lamborghini name and identity, implementing aggressive merchandising and licensing deals. Development of the \\"baby Lambo\\" finally began, moving forward with a US$100 million budget. 1998‚ÄìPresent - Audi =1998‚Äì2007 - Reorganisation, Murci√©lago, and Gallardo= The financial crisis that gripped Asia in July of that year set the stage for another ownership change. The new chairman of Volkswagen AG, Ferdinand Pi√´ch, grandson of Volkswagen's founder, Ferdinand Porsche, went on a buying spree through 1998, purchasing Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini. Volkswagen subsidiary Audi AG acquired Lamborghini in September 1998 for around US$110 million. Audi spokesman Juergen de Graeve told the Wall Street Journal that Lamborghini \\"could strengthen Audi's sporty profile, and on the other hand Lamborghini could benefit from [Audi's] technical expertise.\\" The troubled Italian automaker was reorganised, becoming restructured into a holding company, Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., with Audi president Franz-Josef Paefgen as its chairman. Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. became a subsidiary of the holding company, allowing it to focus specifically on designing and building cars while separate interests took care of the company's licensing deals and marine engine manufacturing. Vittorio Di Capua originally remained in charge, but eventually resigned in June 1999. He was replaced by Giuseppe Greco, another industry veteran with experience at Fiat, Alfa Romeo, and Ferrari. The Diablo's final evolution, the GT, was introduced in 1999 but not exported to the U.S. due to its low-volume production thus making it uneconomical to go through the process of gaining emissions and crashworthiness approval. During the Diablo's 11-year series production run, Lamborghini produced 2,900 examples. The Acosta was the first prototype developed under the P147/L147 programme The Canto was the second prototype developed under the P147/L147 programme Murci√©lago, the culmination of the L147 project, replaced a decade-old Diablo flagship In much the same way that American ownership had influenced the design of the Diablo, Lamborghini's new German parent played a large role in the development of the Diablo's replacement. The first new Lamborghini in more than a decade, known internally as Project L147, represented the rebirth of Lamborghini, and was named, fittingly, for the bull that originally sired the Miura line and had inspired Ferruccio Lamborghini almost 40 years before: Murci√©lago. The new flagship car was styled by Belgian Luc Donckerwolke, Lamborghini's new head of design. The racing variants of the Murci√©lago built by Reiter Engineering would enjoy success in motorsports The Murci√©lago was updated in 2005, now having a more powerful engine generating and being named the LP 640, thus marking the return of the LP (Longitudinal Posteriore) naming convention. The new model would also mark the debut of the new single-clutch transmission called E Gear which used pedals mounted on the steering column to change gears. This transmission would eventually replace the manual transmission in the coming years. The Murci√©lago was not meant to compete in racing events but privateer racing teams would develop their own racing variants which would prove successful in motorsports. Gallardo Under German ownership, Lamborghini found stability that it had not seen in many years. In 2003, Lamborghini followed up the Murci√©lago with the smaller, V10-equipped Gallardo, intended to be more accessible and more livable than the Murci√©lago. The Gallardo would spawn several variants in the subsequent years of production which included the Spyder (convertible version), the Balboni (a low cost, rear-wheel-drive variant) and the Superleggera (a lighter and powerful track-focused version). In 2007, Wolfgang Egger was appointed as the new head of design of Audi and Lamborghini, replacing Walter de'Silva, who was responsible for the design of only one car during his appointment, the Miura Concept of 2006. =2008‚Äì2010 - Revent√≥n, production peak, end of Murci√©lago production run, Gallardo update= Reventon Towards the end of the 2000s (decade), Lamborghini produced a number of revisions of the Murci√©lago and Gallardo. Lamborghini introduced the Revent√≥n, a limited-edition derivative of the Murci√©lago featuring a newly designed body with more angular styling, and a roadster the following year. The final update to the Murci√©lago came in 2009 with the introduction of the LP 670‚Äì4 SV (\\"SuperVeloce\\"). The Murci√©lago LP670-4 SV was the final evolution of the Murci√©lago After ten years of Murci√©lago series production, Lamborghini produced the 4,000th example, an LP 670‚Äì4 SV destined for China, in February 2010. Lamborghini produced the last Murci√©lago, number 4,099 on 11 May 2010, but did not officially mark the end of production until six months later on 5 November 2010. The Gallardo was updated in 2008 and was now more powerful and responsive than the outgoing version The Gallardo received a facelift in 2008, now having a more aggressive design and new LED head lamps and tail lamps, inline with Lamborghini's new design language. The engine was also overhauled, now being a 5.2-litre uneven firing unit and generating in the base model, which was called the LP 560-4. The variants would follow up with the update as well and the Gallardo would now use the company's new single-clutch E Gear transmission debuted on the Murci√©lago LP 640. Lamborghini achieved its highest ever yearly sales figure in 2008, selling 2,430 vehicles. During this decade the Asia-Pacific market became more important to the company's sales performance, growing to represent 25 percent of Lamborghini's overall worldwide sales. Despite the strength of the Asia- Pacific market, the effects of the world financial crisis that began in 2007 caused Lamborghini's sales to drop almost 50% below their 2008 peak to 1,515 vehicles in 2009 and 1,302 vehicles in 2010. CEO Stephan Winkelmann predicted in 2009 that poor sales figures for sports cars would continue through 2011; history would prove him right. =2011‚Äìpresent - Aventador, end of Gallardo production, Hurac√°n and Urus= Aventador in 2011 The Aventador, the replacement for the Murci√©lago, debuted on 1 March 2011 at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The Aventador was the first new Lamborghini Automobile in 10 years having an angular design language and an entirely new V12 engine thus signifying the retirement of the original Lamborghini V12 engine designed by Giotto Bizzarrini. The Aventador would continue to evolve in its production years, with a roadster version introduced in 2012 having two removable roof panels. The radically styled Veneno would continue the tradition set by the Revent√≥n In 2013, the Veneno was introduced which was Lamborghini's interpretation of a racing prototype meant for the road. The sharp, angular designed body was based around the Aventador's monocoque and mechanical components. A roadster variant would follow up in 2014, fewer than 10 units would be sold at US$4,500,000 each, making it one of the most expensive Lamborghini automobiles ever produced. In 2013, Lamborghini celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing a special model of the Aventador, the Aventador LP 720-4 50¬∞ Anniversario. 200 units in total of coup√© and roadster variants were produced. As the name signifies, the engine was upgraded to generate . The body work was also modified and the car had new front and rear bumpers along with special exterior colours. The Aventador SV would continue the legacy of the Super Veloce name, introduced by the Miura In 2015, a light weight, powerful and trackfocused iteration of the Aventador called the Aventador SV (Super Veloce) was introduced. The SV would also spawn a roadster variant introduced later that year. It would ultimately be discontinued in 2017. The Centenario was the celebration of the 100th birthday of the company's founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini The Centenario introduced in 2016 was a celebration of Ferruccio Lamborghini's 100th birthday. It would follow up the principles set by the Veneno using an even aggressive design language in its own right. The car saw the use of the world's largest rear diffusers ever incorporated into a production automobile. The Centenario saw the debut of Lamborghini's four-wheel steering system and torque vectoring. A Roadster version would follow up later in the year, 40 units of the Centenario were produced in total. The Aventador S, replacing the Aventador used an all-new design language along with new wheel designs The Aventador was updated in 2017 and was now called the Aventador S LP 740-4. The engine was modified and now generated a power output of . The Roadster variant would also be updated as well. The four-wheel steering and torque vectoring system would also be used on the S version aside from exterior updates. The SVJ is the ultimate current iteration of the Aventador The ultimate track focused iteration of the Aventador called the Aventador Super Veloce Jota (SVJ) was introduced in 2018 and used Lamborghini's Aerodynamica Lamborghini Attiva (ALA) system which uses active aerodynamics to increase downforce generated by the car. The SVJ generates 40 percent more downforce than the SV. It also reclaimed the Nurb√ºrgring Nordschleife lap record form the Porsche 911 GT2 RS by setting a lap time of 6:44.97 with Lamborghini test driver Marco Mapelli behind the wheel achieved by using the Pirelli Trofeo R tyres available with the car as an option. Lamborghini introduced the Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570‚Äì4 Super Trofeo Stradale at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. The Sesto Elemento was based on the Gallardo Superleggera In 2012-2013, towards the end of its production, subsequent limited editions of the Gallardo would be unveiled, including the Sesto Elemento (Sixth Element), a limited edition car based on the Gallardo Superleggera with a newly designed body and aesthetics for track use only. Production of the Gallardo ended on 25 November 2013, after 14,022 examples had been produced. At the time of its discontinuation, the Gallardo was the highest selling Lamborghini model, with almost half of all Lamborghini automobiles ever produced being Gallardos. The Hurac√†n would replace the most successful Lamborghini model in history, the Gallardo The Gallardo's replacement, the Hurac√°n LP610-4, was announced in December 2013, and made its worldwide debut at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The Hurac√°n presents significant improvements over the Gallardo, such as a power output increase to , a time of 3.2 seconds, a top speed of and the use of a dual-clutch transmission. The convertible version, called the Hurac√°n Spyder would follow up at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show followed up by the low cost, rear wheel drive LP580-2 coup√© and convertible models in 2016, having the V10 engines detuned to while remaining in par with performance as the \\"base\\" LP610-4 models. The most powerful iteration of the Hurac√°n, the LP640-4 Performante, was unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show having the power increased to and using the forged carbon fibre body components from the Sesto Elemento in order to achieve a time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed as high as . along with achieving a lap time of 6:52.01 on the N√ºrburgring Nordschleife, with Marco Mapelli behind the wheel, making it one of the world's fastest production car around the track, only to be beaten by the Porsche 911 GT2 RS later that year which set a lap time of 6:47.03 The Urus is the second off-road vehicle produced by the company since the LM002 Introduced as a concept at the 2012 Pebble Beach Concours D'Elegance, the Urus would be unveiled in its production form in 2017. It would be the second off-road vehicle produced by the company since the LM002 which was introduced under the Mimran ownership. The Urus is based on a Volkswagen platform and shares its engine with the Porsche Cayenne but uses its own distinctive technologies such as using the biggest carbon ceramic brakes to ever be fitted on a vehicle. The Urus was first styled as a concept by Fillipo Perini, the company's former chief designer but would later be refined by Mitja Borkert, the current chief designer of Lamborghini. The design language of the Urus is heavily influenced by the Aventador. The Si√°n would mark the return to the aggressive wedge shape design language and had a tail-light design inspired by the Countach On 3 September 2019, Lamborghini would unveil its first hybrid automobile called the Si√°n FKP 37. The first half of the name meant \\"flash of lightning\\" in Italian, a name befitting to the new model due to the technology it used while the second half was a tribute to late Volkswagen Group Chairman Ferdinand Pi√´ch with \\"FKP\\" being the initials of his name and \\"37\\" being the last two digits of his birth year. The Si√°n used the ultimate iteration of the V12 engine from the Aventador SVJ, but would combine it with an electric motor powered by a supercapacitor (in essence, an enlarged version of the supercapacitor used in the Aventador's starter motor) to store energy. The supercapacitor was used due to its ability to efficiently store electrical energy than a conventional lithium ion battery. The capacitors would be charged by the car's regenerative braking system instead of a conventional power outlet. While the role of electric motor would be limited to only aid in parking the car and to counter the effects of deceleration, the Si√°n FKP 37 would be the brand's first entry in the more mainstream hybrid market and would proclaim itself to be the most powerful Lamborghini automobile. In July 2020, the company announced the production of the 10,000th unit of the Urus.

History Xapo CEO and entrepreneur Wences Casares became interested in bitcoins because of the frequent financial fluctuations in his native Argentina. He has said that his family's finances were ‚Äúdevastated as the economy (in Argentina) rocketed from inflation to deflation to devaluation.‚Äù Casares believes that digital currencies such as bitcoin ‚Äúcould solve the disjointed nature of our world economy.‚Äù In 2011, Casares bought his first bitcoins but couldn't find a way to store them, so he built a ‚Äòvault‚Äô for his own use. Friends, and later financial institutions, soon asked Casares if they could store their bitcoins in his vault. This became the foundation for Xapo, which was founded in late 2013 by Casares and COO Federico Murrone. Xapo opened its products to the public in March 2014. Casares said Xapo was founded with the aim of making the bitcoin currency more secure and accessible. The Xapo Wallet operates through a mobile app and online and includes the ability to transfer funds to and from the Xapo Vault. In April 2014, Xapo introduced a debit card that will link to the user's Xapo Wallet and will function like a standard debit card, except that it is backed by bitcoins instead of traditional currency. Prior to Xapo, Casares founded and later sold online brokerage firm Patagon to Banco Santander for $750 million. He also launched the first Internet provider in his home country of Argentina in 1994. In May 2015 Xapo moved its headquarters from Palo Alto, California to Zug, located in the Zurich metropolitan area of Switzerland. That year LifeLock, which acquired Lemon, a company led by eventual Xapo founder Casares, alleged in a suit that Casares developed the source code for Xapo using Lemon's resources. In July 2017, Xapo was granted a European e-money license in Gibraltar allowing it to provide electronic fiat money custodial and transfer services. In July 2018 Xapo Inc. was awarded a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services and with it formal approval to operate in the state of New York as a regulated Bitcoin business. Xapo's BitLicense was the sixth to be awarded. Security The Xapo Vault consists of physical servers located around the globe that the company says is protected by biometric scanner access, 24-7 video surveillance, and armed guards. Casares claims that Xapo ‚Äúis the first bitcoin vault fully protected and insured against hacking and bankruptcy.‚Äù In August 2014, Xapo announced it had raised $20 million to further enhance its security measures.  Full reserve banking The Xapo vault holds client bitcoins following a full reserve banking and fully segregated model. Users can verify that their funds are in an individual multi-signature Bitcoin address and not pooled or co-mingled with other users' funds. Legal title to vault bitcoins is always users', with the property registered in their name following the model of allocated (bailment) gold contracts and never loaned, invested or put at risk. In case of Xapo going bankrupt or going through a process of liquidation, bitcoins in the vault would be completely insulated and vault users would have clear title to them.  Corporate Structure / legal United States residents using Xapo.com services in the United States are engaging not with Xapo Limited (Hong Kong) but with Xapo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xapo Holding Limited (Cayman Islands) incorporated in 2014 with its principal place of business in Palo Alto, California, United States. Funding Xapo announced $20 million Series A funding in March 2014. The funding round was led by Benchmark, with participation from Fortress Investment Group, Pantera Capital, and Ribbit Capital. Benchmark partner Matt Cohler said the VC firm backed Xapo in part because Xapo ‚Äúis led by one of the most important people in the bitcoin ecosystem, it‚Äôs insured and has investors from both Silicon Valley and Wall Street.‚Äù The company has raised a total of $40 million as of August 2014.

Musically the band played a powerful Australian style of rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll, very close to the pulse of Radio Birdman and Sonic's Rendezvous Band but with a harder edge and more full-on production. Sean Greenway died unexpectedly in January 2001 and with his passing The Yes-Men ceased to exist. Background Greenway was pretty much a mainstay of the burgeoning Melbourne underground rock scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He started his career as a teenager in Foot and Mouth and then formed God with whom he had much success. God (often stylized as GOD) was a rock 'n' roll band from Melbourne, together from 1986 to 1989 and comprising Joel Silbersher, Tim Hemensley, Sean Greenway and Matthew Whittle. All members were 15-16 at the time of the band's formation. Prior to God's formation, Hemensley had been a member of Royal Flush (with Roman Tucker, later of Rocket Science), Greenway and Whittle were members of Foot and Mouth, and Silbersher had his own radio show on 3RRR. The debut 7\\" single My Pal by God from 1987 is their best known track. It got very favourable reviews and sold in the thousands (which was a lot then for an independent band). It became an independent classic and cover versions have been recorded by several bands, including Magic Dirt, The Hollowmen, Bored!, A Death In The Family and Bum (from Canada). Following God, Greenway formed the Freeloaders with ex-members of the peripatetic The Philisteins. This lineup of the Freeloaders released a couple of singles through Dog Meat Records before Greenway left in 1995 and began a new project he would eventually call The Yes-Men. History Greenway wrote most of the first Yes-Men songs and began recording these songs prior to even having a band to perform them. He recruited Sydney based musician Stewart Leadfinger Cunningham as lead guitarist and began rehearsing and arranging the songs with him during visits to Sydney and when Cunningham was in Melbourne (Cunningham was then playing in Asteroid B-612 and Brother Brick and would visit Melbourne every 6 weeks to play gigs). The first recording sessions for The Yes-Men involved Greenway and long time friend Matthew Whittle(ex-God) laying down bass, guitar and drum tracks at Birdland Studios in Prahran whilst Cunningham would lay down his parts when he was in Melbourne. These earlier recordings would eventually surface on the 2005 posthumous self-titled album 'The Yes- Men' (aka El Peligro Ha Comenzado). Eventually Mark Hurst (ex- Guttersnipes) was recruited as permanent drummer and Tas Blizzard (Seaweed Gorillas. The Meanies) became the band's first genuine bass player. The addition of these two seasoned musicians solidified the band into a genuine and powerful live band for the first time. This line up recorded the bulk of the Prosody album in fits and spurts through 1997 and 1998 at Birdland studios. Due to the other commitments of the band's members and the fact that Cunningham was based in Sydney the band played live sporadically but managed three trips to Sydney/NSW and regular spots with the Powder Monkeys(who were very generous in their support of the band). The Yes-Men supported The Hellacopters at The Tote Hotel in 1999 with singer Nicke Royale becoming a big fan of The Yes-Men's music. This support led to The Yes-Men's first album Prosody being released in Europe through The Hellacopters White Jazz record label. It is probably fair to say that The Yes-Men are more widely known and loved among European rock fans than in their home country because of this European release and The Hellacopters support. In late 1998 Jay Curley (ex-The Proton Energy Pills, Tumbleweed) replaced Tas Blizzard on bass and the final tracks (Fawlty Rocks, Fratricide, I Won't Run and Casting Stones) were recorded. The album, titled Prosody was finally finished after almost 4 years of lead up work and sporadic recording. Greenway agreed to have Melbourne record label Stolen Records release the album in Australia on vinyl and CD. White Jazz Records in Sweden would release the album in Europe with the band slated to support the Hellacopters on a Euro tour down the track. The album Prosody was and still is critically acclaimed but fate would step in to thwart the band moving further forward in two ways. The White Jazz label got into legal difficulties and failed to fully support and promote the album. Then on 21 January 2001, the band's leader and founder Sean Greenway died from an accidental heroin dose. It was mocking destiny. Shortly before, the band had begun to collect their first international appreciation thanks to an album, \\"Prosody\\" that showed their great skills in writing rough and soulful songs and then it was all over. A memorial gig was organised for 4 February at the Tote Hotel in Melbourne and the following bands played...The Mystaken, Joel Silbersher and Charlie Owen, The Onyas, The Seminal Rats, The Powder Monkeys, Rocket Science, The Casanovas and The Yes Men with Simon Faulkner of The Splatterheads doin the vocals and Matthew Whittle on guitar.

He had a younger brother who, like he did, became a journalist. From the early 1930s onwards, both parents were intimately connected to the work of Anthroposophy. Charles Davy wrote a number of books, amongst others The Three Spheres of Society (1946) on Social threefolding, while Doris Davy wrote travelogues and children‚Äôs books. Her main interest, however, was in biodynamic farming and she edited the journal of the BD movement, \\"Star and Furrow\\", for many years. The two boys attended Abbotsholme School in N. England, strongly influenced by the pedagogical ideas of Kurt Hahn but John asked to spend his last year of schooling at Michael Hall, in Forest Row. Here he was taught by Cecil Harwood and Francis Edmunds, both of whom remained connected with him in his anthroposophical work for the rest of his life. His military service he spent in Vienna as a member of the Intelligence Corps from 1945 ‚Äì 1947, where his main task was the interrogation of refugees. He studied at Cambridge University and immediately thereafter met his future German wife, Gudrun zur Linden, whom he followed to Germany in order to learn German. He worked there as woodsman, taught English at the Waldorf School in Stuttgart and finally obtained a scholarship to study for a year at the University of Freiburg. =Science correspondent= Quite unexpectedly, he received an offer from The Observer in London to act as their first science editor. Under the chief editorship of David Astor, the paper showed great openness to new socio- political, scientific and ecological ideas. He accepted, married and moved to Forest Row in Sussex, commuting to London every day. His duties entailed reporting on the newest scientific developments of the 1950s: the computer, the beginnings of space travel, on latest developments in psychological theory, the discovery of the structure of DNA and much more. Through his 16 years with The Observer Davy came to know personally most of the great inventors and discoverers of his time. In acknowledgement for his achievements he received the Order of the British Empire, having contributed greatly to the international recognition of figures like Rachel Carson (Silent Spring), E.F. Schumacher (Small Is Beautiful), Ivan Illich (Deschooling Society) and others, drawing attention to many of the dangerous developments of modern civilisation. In the course of these years, John Davy was often requested to hold lectures and write articles relating to the Anthroposophical work. For professional reasons, he published this work under the pseudonym \\"John Waterman\\", adopting the pen name of his father \\"Charles Waterman\\". =Emerson College= In 1962 Francis Edmunds had founded Emerson College in Forest Row, in pursuit of an ideal to bring young people from all over the world together, enabling them to receive a comprehensive training in thought, art and handcrafts on an anthroposophical basis. From the start he had wanted to include John Davy as his co-worker in the project, a position Davy accepted in 1969. He became assistant-director of the college, with the primary responsibility for development and course of the Foundation Year. His particular fields were the development of scientific method and viewpoint; its strengths and limitations; their relationship to other means of perception, in particular to the work of the artist and thirdly, methods of working together in groups with the aim of deepening our phenomenological understanding of nature. Besides directing the work of the College, he had become increasingly engaged in the work of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain. For many years he had worked together with Cecil Harwood and other British anthroposophists to re-unify the General Anthroposophical Society, from which the British Society had separated in 1935. This was finally achieved in 1963. After Harwood‚Äôs death his responsibilities within the leadership of the Society increased greatly. Besides this, he was invited on a large number of lecture tours internationally, particularly to Canada and the USA. Here he paid particular attention to invitations from a large number of universities and other non-anthroposophical institutions where people wanted to hear about Rudolf Steiner, the method and results of his research and its further development. In April 1984 when he was unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer and died in October of that year.

Ladd was ordained deacon on June 11, 1897, and priest on June 11, 1898. After work as a parish priest in the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire, he served as professor of church history (1904‚Äì1941) at Berkeley Divinity School, of which he later became dean (1918‚Äì1941). The school had been founded in Middletown, Connecticut, but Ladd worked to move it to New Haven, home of Yale University, believing connection with a major university and presence in an urban center were better suited to training of clergy. As Dean of Berkeley, Ladd was seen as an inspiring if sometimes controversial figure. Socialist in sympathies, he chaired a major review of child welfare for the state of Connecticut. He was responsible for bringing a number of sympathetic Anglican thinkers as visiting professors including Percy Dearmer and Geoffrey Studdert Kennedy. Ladd died on July 1, 1941, in New Haven. Ladd was active in the dissemination of Liturgical Movement principles in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. His book Prayer Book Interleaves, published only after his death, was based on columns that had appeared in the Episcopal Church magazine The Witness. It was reprinted in 1957 with a new introduction by his student Massey H. Shepherd and then again in the centenary year of his appointment as Dean of Berkeley.

It is also a National shrine under the direction of the Diocese of Brownsville. History The Rev. Jose Maria Azpiazu, O.M.I., pastor of the parish of St. John the Baptist in San Juan began fostering a devotion to Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos after he was made pastor in 1949. He commissioned an artist in Guadalajara, Mexico to reproduce the statue of the Virgin that was venerated at San Juan de los Lagos. He placed the completed statue in the San Juan chapel. Upon the approval of Bishop Mariano S. Garriaga of Corpus Christi a new church and shrine dedicated to the Virgin of San Juan were built in 1954. On October 23, 1970 a low-flying airplane crashed into the shrine and exploded into flames. The shrine was destroyed with the exception of the tower, which still stands. Although there were people in the shrine, the pilot of a plane, Francis B. Alexander, was the only one killed. The loss was estimated at $1.5 million. The Rev. Patricio Dominguez, O.M.I. and the sacristan Pedro Rodriguez rescued the statue of Our Lady of San Juan del Valle. A diocesan priest, the Rev. Ron Anderson, saved the Blessed Sacrament from the fire. The shrine‚Äôs dining room became the temporary home for the statue. Brownsville Bishop John J. Fitzpatrick separated the shrine from the parish. Plans were made to build a parish church on the site of the former shrine and build a larger shrine church on the same property just to the north. The ground breaking for the new shrine was held on November 27, 1976. Cardinal Humberto Medeiros of Boston was present for the dedication along with Bishop Fitzpatrick and an estimated crowd of 50,000 people on April 19, 1980. Outdoor Stations of the Cross made up of 30 life size bronze statues were placed along a 3/4 mile path and were dedicated on October 16, 1993. The mural, Jesus Presents his Mother, on the shrine's exterior wall was blessed on February 2, 1995. The shrine itself was designated a national Shrine by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops on March 24, 1998. Pope John Paul II designated the shrine as a minor Basilica on June 12, 1999.

It was led by chieftain Luka Vukaloviƒá. Background After the death of Ali-pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá, who had made efforts to promote agriculture and recuperate the economy of the Herzegovina Eyalet under his rule, the eyalet was abolished and merged into the Bosnia Eyalet. In March 1852, Ottoman general Omar Pasha (Omer-pa≈°a) decided to disarm the Herzegovinians, which sparked an outrage in the region. The chieftain of the Herzegovinians was Luka Vukaloviƒá. The refusal of giving up arms resulted in minor fights between Vlasi from Herzegovina and Turks (local Slavic Muslims), which in turn resulted in an uprising, which Vukaloviƒá would lead. Uprising Omar Pasha, Ottoman general. Luka Vukaloviƒá, leader of the uprising 1852‚Äì62. The uprising began in winter 1852/53, when Grahovo, Banjani and Drobnjaci refused to pay the Turks a debt. As the actions against Montenegro by the Ottomans began, the East Herzegovinian clans fought alongside Montenegrins. Although there weren't major actions in the period of 1853‚Äì57, there wasn‚Äôt peace. Austria evidently interfered in the actions of Vukaloviƒá, as it would help Montenegro, and the French consulates followed the uprising. The uprising was boosted in December 1857, after Knez Danilo started backing the rebels, bitter at the Porte because of its statements in the Paris Congress in 1856. After the Battle of Grahovac on May 1, 1858, when Montenegrin and Herzegovinian rebels defeated the Turks, Knez Danilo titled Vukaloviƒá the voivode of Zubac, Kru≈°evica, Draƒçevica and Sutorina, giving him some autonomy. The Porte agreed on appeasement, it carried out a border with Montenegro, thus recognizing the independence of Montenegro. As the great part of East Herzegovina, except Grahovo, part of Banjani, Drobnjaci, ≈Ωupa and Nik≈°iƒç Rudina was left under Ottoman rule, Vukaloviƒá continued the uprising. This strongly echoed in Bosnia, in particular the revolts in Bosanska Krajina and Posavina in 1858. Afraid that the uprising would spill over in its territory, Austria increased its tackling of Vukaloviƒá, helping in different ways even the Turks. Vukaloviƒá in his requests didn't only deal with economical problems of Herzegovina, but marking the fight for national liberation, seeking for Herzegovina to join Montenegro. This character of uprising sparked the interest of the great powers of Europe, whom consulate representatives worked on giving Vukaloviƒá to the Ottoman government. Vukaloviƒá continued fighting against the Turks, and after the violent death of Knez Danilo in 1860, inspired by the unification of Italy which was led by Garibaldi. Since 1861, Omer-pa≈°a tried in many ways to end the uprising, unsuccessfully. But when Montenegro, after a defeat to the Turk in August 1862, promised that it wouldn't help the rebel movement in Herzegovina, Vukaloviƒá understood this as the people had been strained and then wrote to Omer-pa≈°a, who promised amnesty for all rebels. Aftermath Omer-pa≈°a promised Vukaloviƒá that he would continue his office as voivode of Zubac, Kru≈°evica, Draƒçevica and Sutorina, but this was not held, he instead appointed him bimba≈°a of 500 pandurs who would secure peace along the borders. When he saw that the Ottomans didn't give their promises of relief on feudal duties and tax cuts, he tried in 1865 to once again start an uprising, but without any help, was unsuccessful. Vukaloviƒá left his birthplace and migrated to Russia, where he died in 1873.

Schneirla convinced Rosenblatt that the study of animal behavior would broaden his understanding of human behavior and that it was interesting in itself. He began his research on the role of hormones and experience on the sexual behavior of male cats. Supported by Schneirla, he began his doctoral work in 1958 at the American Museum of Natural History study of early learning in kittens. He discovered that kittens could orient to home by 3 to 4 days of age and that they formed nipple attachment preferences by 1 to 2 days of age. This was contrary to learning paradigms of that time, which assumed that animals could not learn at very young ages. In the 1950s, while an assistant professor at the City College of New York, he became a person of interest for the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was conveyed to the City College of New York. Subsequently, his contract was not renewed he went to Rutgers University at Newark where he joined the Institute of Animal Behavior the Institute of Animal Behavior founded by Daniel S. Lehrman who he had been friends with during graduate school. In 1972, he became director of the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University-Campus at Newark by unanimous vote after the death it founder Daniel S. Lehrman and remained its director for more than 17 years. He served as dean of the Graduate School of Rutgers University-Newark. He also served as editor for Advance in the Study of Behavior for more than 10 years. In 2005, he retired as Daniel S. Lehrman Professor of Psychobiology. After his retirement, he continued to work at the Rutgers University-Campus at Newark until 2012. He was viewed as a successful mentor by those who knew him: Painter \\"Mother and older Child\\" a painting by Jay S. Rosenblatt As a teenager, Rosenblatt apprenticed in the studio of Ben Wilson under the Works in Progress Administration. Wilson had a major impact on him, Rosenblatt would later say of Wilson \\"I saw that he was thoughtful and deeply sincere in his work and that he would be supportive of my becoming a painter.\\" He would keep in contact with Wilson for 63 years until Wilson died in 2005. Rosenblatt's painting was influenced not only by Wilson but also by painters such as Georges Braque, Paul C√©zanne, and Pablo Picasso. The content of his paintings was influenced by Judaism and Marxism. Many of his paintings were political focusing on war and The Holocaust. Another major theme of his paintings were of mothers and their children, which would mirror his scientific interest in maternal behavior as a scientist. For example, in his painting \\"Mother and older Child,\\" both of his subjective and scientific perspectives of mother- child relationships are expressed, evoking both discomfort and comfort in the viewer. He never became a professional painter, but Rutgers University held a show in the late 1990s for 56 of his paintings. Psychoanalysis and clinical psychologist  Rosenblatt met psychoanalyst Max Hertzman while he was a teaching assistant at City College of New York. He was interested in psychoanalysis because he wanted to understand better \\"intrapsychic events\\" in himself and his clients. He also wanted to find out if psychology as he understood it could be applied to real people, which led him to take a job at the Pediatric Psychiatry Clinic at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. There he diagnosed children with emotional and psychological disorders. He discovered that his formal training in psychology helped him to understand the children he diagnosed. Scientist Rosenblatt's research in developmental psychobiology focused on early neonate learning and maternal behavior. It explored these processes using multiple levels of analysis, using multiple techniques, and from multiple perspectives (i.e., proximal, functional, comparative, and evolutionary). =Neonate learning= In the 1960s, Rosenblatt experimentally demonstrated that learning in newly born animals occurred earlier than had been thought possible (see Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). His early work with kittens showed that early learning in neonates initially involved single sensory modalities such as tactile, thermal, and olfactory sensory modalities. As development proceeded these sensory modalities are integrated and learning becomes multimodal. His early work with kittens demonstrated these developmental processes of early learning and set the stage for a new field of research that focuses on neonatal learning in naturalistic contexts (see Rosenblatt, 1971; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). The discovery of early learning in neonates was, according to Rosenblatt, serendipitous. It occurred while he was studying cats in the 1950s and when he was weighing kittens on a daily basis. He noticed that when he returned the kittens to their home environment (without their mother present), they returned to their home corner faster and faster each day. The kittens' eyes had not yet opened during this time and so they were blind to any visual stimuli. The only way they could find the corner they had been in is by learning the olfactory characteristics of that area in their home environment where they had been nursed (see Rosenblatt, 1983; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). =Maternal behavior= He did his seminal work on maternal behavior during the late 1960s through the 1970s. This work consisted of two major themes: behavioral transitions in maternal cyclic patterns of behavior and the coupling of mother-offspring behavior during these maternal cycles (Rosenblatt, 1970). His work on maternal behavior, starting in the 1960s, focused primarily on the rat as an animal model. He identified three important phases in maternal cyclic patterns of behavior: the first phase spans conception through most of pregnancy, the second begins towards the end of pregnancy and continues through birth, and the third is the maintenance phase, which extends from the postpartum phase to weaning. He began his research by describing the phenomena associated with each of these phases of the mother-offspring cyclic patterns of behavior. His studies also determined the role of sensory factors in mother and offspring behavior. He investigated physiological, hormonal, and affective mechanisms and their feedback in maternal and offspring cyclic patterns of behavior (Rosenblatt, 1980). It is because of Rosenblatt's early study of maternal behavior, the coupling of mother-offspring behavior, and his conceptualization of these behavioral processes as occurring in phases that he is often called \\"father of mothering\\" or \\"father of maternal behavior\\" within the field of psychobiology. Rosenblatt's 1967 study of the induction of maternal behavior is consider by many in his field to be his most famous study. In that study he showed that the neural basis of parental care is independent of pregnancy and birth. He found that he could induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats during a 6 to 8 day period by continuously exposing them to rat pups. He also found that female rats that were ovariectomized or hypophysectomized could also be induced to exhibit maternal behavior via the continuous exposure to rat pups. Although the hormonal and physiological processes that occur during pregnancy and birth enhance maternal behavior, maternal behavior has an already developed neural basis in the brain. Honors and awards He received several honors and awards during his career. In 1971, he was elected as a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society. In 2004, he was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1986, a volume of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences was published in honor of Jay S. Rosenblatt for his contributions to the field of animal behavior. In 1987, he received a Doctorate honoris causa from the University of Gothenburg and, in 1997, he received a Doctorate honoris causa from the National University of Distance Education. Selected bibliography During his career, Rosenblatt published over 160 articles and chapters.

Jubilee USA's work began in conjunction with the global Jubilee 2000 movement, founded in the late 1990s to advocate for debt relief for developing countries. It is \\"an alliance of more than 75 U.S. organizations, 650 faith communities and 50 Jubilee global partners.\\"  Origin and Mission  The name \\"Jubilee\\" is derived from the Biblical Jubilee in Leviticus, a system of debt cancellation, land restoration and liberation from bondage embedded in a 7-year cycle. Jubilee USA is located in Washington D.C. and is a coalition of approximately 75 national religious and development organizations and about 400 communities of faith across the country. It describes its mission as \\"building an economy that serves, protects and promotes the participation of the most vulnerable\\".  Advocacy  Jubilee USA primarily advocates for financial reforms that argues to help impoverished communities. Those reforms include rules governing \\"responsible lending and borrowing\\", halting corporate tax avoidance, particularly in the developing world, reforming international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), creating an international bankruptcy system and advancing trade policies that promote the common good.  Leadership  Jubilee USA is governed by a steering committee (\\"Network Council\\") that consists of roughly 75 national organizations and a board of directors. Many of the organizations are religious, including American Jewish World Service, Church World Service, a number of Catholic orders and the national Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, Unitarian, Episcopal and United Church of Christ churches. Other notable groups on the council include the AFL‚ÄìCIO and ActionAid.  Core Issues  = 1. Responsible Lending and Borrowing = One of Jubilee USA's stated main goals is to promote principles of Responsible Lending and Borrowing. These principles would purportedly guide lending decisions made by governments and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Jubilee USA's Executive Director, Eric LeCompte, was part of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) working group that created a document called Principles on Promoting Sovereign Lending and Borrowing. The UNCTAD principles guide lending and borrowing decisions. For lending countries, the principles include ensuring that borrowing countries have the capacity to pay back the loan and adhering to UN sanctions. For borrowers, the principles include ensuring that information about the nature of the debt negotiations are available to all stakeholders, including citizens, as well as ensuring that governments avoid over-borrowing. In 2008, Jubilee USA introduced legislation aimed at increasing debt cancellation for developing countries and instituting lending and borrowing guidelines. The Jubilee Act for Responsible Lending and Expanded Debt Cancellation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 285‚Äì132 but was not adopted by the Senate. According to the Library of Congress summary, the legislation would have directed the US government to work within the IMF, Paris Club, World Bank and other institutions to expand previous debt cancellation programs for developing countries. It would have also directed the Treasury Secretary to \\"commence immediate efforts to establish a framework for responsible lending\\". The bill was sponsored by Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and cosponsored by 104 House members. = 2. Corporate Tax Avoidance = The organization aims to stop corporate tax avoidance and to promote financial transparency and accountability. It argues that poor countries are forced to borrow money (and thus increase debt burdens) because of a lack of domestic revenue, and that corporate tax avoidance is a large factor in that lack of revenue. Jubilee USA is a co-founder of the FACT Coalition, which includes groups such as Global Financial Integrity, US Public Interest Research Group and Global Witness. = 3. International Financial Institution Reform = The organization attempts to reform international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. It ran a multi-year campaign to move the IMF to give several billion dollars worth of windfall gold sales profits to poor countries. It advocates for transparency in decision-making and policy processes; its work in the Caribbean on IMF debt restructuring has received coverage in the National Catholic Reporter and Inter Press Service. = 4. International Bankruptcy System = The organization's final goal is the formation of an international bankruptcy system for countries. This system would involve a neutral arbiter that would decide the merits of debt claims and process bankruptcy proceeding when countries no longer can service their debts. This issue has received increased coverage in light of the recent Argentina/NML Capital case. Jubilee USA has argued that such a bankruptcy system would prevent this type of litigation by forcing all creditors to negotiate under an existing set of rules and receive equivalent treatment. = 5. Vulture Funds = Jubilee USA is an outspoken critic of the actions of \\"vulture funds\\". Vulture funds are entities that buy up the debt of sovereign countries on the secondary market (often for much less than the value of the original debt) and then sue for full repayment. Jubilee USA filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in March 2014 in a debt dispute between Argentina and a group of hedge funds. The case, Argentina vs. NML Capital, stemmed from Argentina's 2001 debt default. After the default, Argentina offered its creditors approximately 30 cents on the dollar to restructure, with about 92% of the creditors accepting the deal. Those not accepting the deal included hedge funds led by NML Capital, a subsidiary of Elliot Management. Elliot is run by Paul Singer, who has past involvement with sovereign debt litigation, particularly in Peru. NML sued Argentina for full re-payment and was awarded approximately $1.5 billion by U.S. Second District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa. That ruling was upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On May 21, Jubilee USA's Executive Director Eric LeCompte met with Argentinean Pope Francis and Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin to discuss the ramifications of the court case on the poor, with all parties \\"critical of the global financial system\\". In June 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina's appeal. Jubilee USA has been actively involved in the media discussion of the case in the aftermath of the court's decision. Notable examples include The Washington Post, Time, NPR, Democracy Now, The Wall Street Journal, Inter Press Service, and Bloomberg. The organization also commented on the precedent set by the court decision for other countries facing debt litigation, such as Grenada and the DR Congo.

High school For much of Torgalski's childhood, his father, Bob, was a coach and athletic director at Saint Francis High School in Athol Springs, New York. Between several different sports and schools, Bob's high school coaching career lasted for over 50 years. Torgalski played baseball, basketball and football at Nichols School in Buffalo. As a baseball player, he was variously named to the All-Catholic team, the All Niagara Frontier League team and Honorable Mention All-WNY. In his single season as a sophomore football player, he was named Honorable Mention All-Catholic. In 1985, Torgalski and teammate Christian Laettner led Nichols to a New York state basketball title in Class C. Torgalski was named Most Valuable Player of the state tournament and Class C All-State. Torgalski graduated as the leading scorer in Nichols history (with 1,783 points) and was later inducted into the school's athletics hall of fame. In 1985 he was named to the All-WNY team by The Buffalo News alongside Clifford Robinson. College Torgalski went on to play both baseball and basketball in NCAA Division III at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. He majored in psychology and was a member of Delta Upsilon. As a basketball player, Torgalski scored more than 1,000 points and finished his career with the third-most assists of any Division III player in history at that point. He also helped Hamilton to championships in the ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments in 1986 and 1987. In 1989, he averaged 10.6 assists per game and was named to the All-ECAC first team.

United States. It is a small wooden building in the Greek Revival architectural style built in the 1830s. Also on its lot is the cemetery where many of the early members were buried. In 2011 the church, cemetery and the stone wall that surrounds them were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the time of the church's construction, West Somers was a thriving agricultural community. Burials had begun in the cemetery almost a decade earlier; most of the area's congregants attended the established Mount Zion Methodist Church some distance away. One of West Somers's more prominent residents built the church so his neighbors would not always have to travel so far; it was so small that circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey, also a Somers resident, likened it to a tiger's cage. Throughout the rest of the 19th century the church was a cornerstone of the West Somers community, with itinerant ministers leading services in the absence of a pastor (according to the United Methodist Church, successor to the Methodist Episcopal Church, the church was never a recognized congregation within the larger denomination). Its Sunday school classes were for a long time the only educational opportunity available to area children. Members continued to be buried in the cemetery; more than half lived to be over 70, an unusually high number for that region and era. Attendance and involvement declined in the early 20th century as West Somers felt the effects of suburbanization and the taking of large tracts of local land to create the reservoirs of the New York City water supply system. By the 1950s the church building had suffered such severe decline and neglect that its porch columns had to be replaced. Further restoration and renovation, including moving the church from its original site in the early 21st century, preceded the building's listing on the National Register. Buildings and grounds The former church building and cemetery occupy a lot on the west side of Tomahawk, midway between the hamlets of Granite Springs at Amawalk Reservoir a half-mile to the south and Baldwin Place at the Westchester‚ÄìPutnam county line to the north. To its north and south are houses on large lots; across the road and slightly to the south is a bar surrounded by a parking lot. On the west is the town-owned Koegel Park, through which the North County Trailway passes. The headwaters of the Muscoot River are beyond. Like the park, the surrounding area is predominantly wooded, with some areas such as backyards and the immediate vicinity of the church cleared; this becomes more extensive to the church lot's north. The terrain is gently hilly, with the church's lot a small rise between the road and the hill at the center of the park. To the east the land slopes more steeply to the hamlet of Shenorock and the headwaters of a short unnamed tributary of the Muscoot that, along with nearby Lake Shenorock, drains into the reservoir. =Church= The church building itself is a wood frame clapboard-sided structure on an exposed concrete block foundation faced in stone. It is topped by a shingled front-gabled roof. On each facade are two 12-over-8 double-hung sash windows, not symmetrically placed. alt=The same building from its side and rear, with just two windows in both facades and no other decorative elements On the church's east (front) facade is a 6-by-15-foot () shed-roofed porch. Several piles of loose stones help support the wooden deck. In turn, two smooth round wooden Doric columns support the shingled roof. Below the roofline's overhanging eave is a wide plain frieze. A single wood-paneled door leads into the church's interior, with a wood floor and coved ceiling. Between them are plaster walls wainscoted with horizontal tongue and groove boards topped by molding at the windowsill level. In the walls are the original metal hardware for placing lanterns. The original 14 straight high-backed wooden pews remain, angled towards the entrance and facing the pulpit, on a raised curved platform against the west wall, fronted by a communion rail. There is an opening for a stove (no longer extant) in the middle of the pews. In the center of the platform is a wooden lectern. =Cemetery= alt=A group of grave markers, some large, some small, seen with bare trees and a dusky sky behind them To the west of the church building is the cemetery, really two plots that have grown together over the years. The most conspicuous is that of the Miller family, descended from church builder Thomas Tompkins Miller, located a short distance south of the church. It has a tall obelisk to Miller himself in the middle of a small area delineated by a tasseled iron railing on stone posts. The other plot is located due west of the church. It has some smaller monuments and family plots marked off by iron railings less elaborate than the Millers'. In total there are 76 markers commemorating 95 burials. The earliest is a 10-month-old girl who died in 1831; the most recent burial took place in 1977. Many are members of the same families in groups; among them are eight veterans of wars from the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. More than half were recorded to have been 70 or over at the time of their deaths, an unusually high longevity rate for the era and the region. The markers themselves exhibit the evolution of funerary art during the 19th century. Many are marble or granite; they feature common tombstone motifs of the period such as willows and urns. Earlier markers use script lettering while later ones are in block. They also show the evolution in dating that took place over that time: on the older markers the deceased's date of death and exact age in years, months and days is given, while later ones simply give the span of life in birth and death years as has been common practice since. History The church was built during the early settlement of northern Westchester County, a time when rapidly spreading Methodism was the predominant denomination among those who came to the area. It was most active in the decades after it was built, but suffered greatly after the Civil War. In the 20th and 21st centuries its history has primarily been one of preservation efforts. =1800‚Äì1830: Settlement= Starting during the Revolution, settlers in search of good farmland began working their way up the Muscoot River from its confluence with the Croton River.Today at Muscoot Reservoir Those who reached today's West Somers and cleared the lowlands around the river were rewarded with some of the most fertile soil along it. Good roads and the rivers of the time made it easy to ship their produce to the markets of New York City to the south. By the early years of the 19th century the area had been totally settled. Industry joined the farmers along the banks of the river, using its hydraulic power for various kinds of milling. Somers then was one of Westchester County's economic centers, more populous than the county seat at White Plains. West Somers, where some of the earliest inhabitants had settled, had a general store and blacksmith's shop serving the farms and mills. A post office was established in 1830. By then West Somers was a regular stop on livestock drives along the Peekskill‚ÄìDanbury Turnpike, the predecessor road to today's U.S. Route 202 across the county. Thriving though it was, the community still lacked a house of worship. At that time Methodism was the prevalent Protestant denomination in the area. The Mount Zion Methodist Church (also listed on the National Register), closer to the center of Somers today, was only the third Methodist church in the state when it was established and built in 1794. Many of the West Somers settlers went there for worship. =1837‚Äì1863: Construction= In 1830 a schism in American Methodism over the issue of church governance led to the establishment of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Protestant Church. The latter eschewed bishops and allowed local congregations greater say in their own affairs. It had more appeal to Americans of the era, and in 1837 a group called the Methodist Protestant Society of West Somers bought a half-acre () parcel on the present site for $100 ($ in modern dollars) Thomas Tompkins Miller, a builder who was one of the society's trustees, a town justice of the peace and a descendant of one of the older families in West Somers, built the church himself. There had already been some church activity in the area. A ten-month-old girl's 1831 burial is the oldest in the cemetery plots. Attendance books from that era kept by the Somers Historical Society suggest that Sunday school, an important part of Methodist ministry, had been held in West Somers starting as early as that year. For many local children it would be their only educational opportunity, as all other schools that existed at the time were too far away. alt=A two-story white building with a pointed roof, seen from the side, with gravestones in front, similarly austere Aesthetically the church reflects the exhortation of early Methodist bishop Francis Asbury, who frequently preached at Mount Zion, that the denomination's houses of worship should be \\"plain and decent, but no more expensive than absolutely unavoidable.\\" Like the similarly austere Mount Zion, West Somers is an extremely restrained application of a contemporary neoclassical architectural style. At the time of its construction, it did not have the porch it presently does, although its roof was pierced by a single brick chimney that is no longer extant. The small size of the church attracted some notice at the time. Due to its small size, and lack of a pastor, the church would later be locally known as the Tomahawk Chapel after the street it was on. Hachaliah Bailey, the Somers resident who pioneered the American circus by exhibiting an elephant at what is now known as the Elephant Hotel, observed that \\"Tom Miller is building a church no bigger than a tiger's cage.\\" There is no record that the church was ever assigned a pastor. Services were held by the many itinerant ministers in the area. Greater matters were handled through the more established churches in the area, such as the Yorktown-Croton Lake church in Pines Bridge. In 1844, a further schism, this one over slavery, divided the Methodist Episcopal Church. The abolitionist Northern branch began to implement some of the same reforms in church governance that had caused the split with the Methodist Protestants 16 years earlier, and relations between the two began to thaw. In 1863, during the Civil War, West Somers changed its denomination to affiliate with the Northern Methodist Episcopal Church. The same year, it purchased the one-acre (4,000 m) lot next to the church with the intention of building a new church on it. =1864‚Äì1910: Decline of congregation= After the war ended, the church went into decline. Older members died and were buried in the cemetery; younger ones left the area. They were not so easily replaced. Somers' early economic advantages had been offset when the railroads, which had begun extending themselves into Westchester during the 1840s, grew out having bypassed the town, and newcomers to the region settled where the tracks were. The planned new church was never built. Shortly after the war the original West Somers Methodist Protestant Society, no longer sustainable due to its diminished numbers, turned the church property over to the Methodist Episcopal Society of the Cortlandt Circuit. They had the property surveyed for conversion into a cemetery in 1874, but never followed through with that project, and in 1877 gave it up. The Mount Zion Circuit took over. In the last decades of the 19th century further changes in northern Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church. The railroads began to spur suburbanization, as city residents who originally spent their summers and weekends in the area began to realize that they could live there full-time and commute to their jobs in the city via train. The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing the total amount of land available for development and thus driving up the value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development. Despite these developments, sometime around 1910 the porch was added to the church building. It did not have any effect on the building's use, as services already held sporadically at that time appear to have ceased completely afterwards, except for burials of descendants of members who wished to be buried with their families. Nevertheless, a 1930 photo shows the church still in relatively good condition and the surrounding property maintained. =1910‚Äìpresent: Preservation and restoration= By 1953, however, the property had become neglected and fallen into serious disrepair. Some of the local families got together and restored it, raising money through a Grange fair. They were able to repaint the interior and exterior and replace the roof. In the process of the latter work they removed the chimney completely; a pile of bricks was found in the nearby woods during a later renovation. A neighboring couple cleaned up the landscaping and gravestones. Six years after this restoration, Thomas Miller's granddaughter Ruth was married to Ernest Pinckney, another descendant of an old West Somers family, in the church. It was the last ceremony held in the building; the last burial in the graveyard took place in 1977. Local interest in the church did not wane. The following year an architect appraised the building and found its older elements had seriously deteriorated. A local Eagle Scout did an inventory of the graves and markers for his project. The Somers Historical Society replaced the roof again; another Eagle Scout redid the interior walls as his project. These efforts culminated in 1984 with research into the church's history and ownership. As a result, the United Methodist Church formally transferred the church to the town two years later; its remaining records and some of its other artifacts were removed to the custody of the historical society, which has had responsibility for the site ever since. alt=A group of graves inside a small metal railing low to the ground. In the middle is a large gray obelisk. Behind are bare trees, through which a nearby yellow house is visible. Concern for the building did not end there and then. In 1989 another local architect who evaluated the church's condition recommended moving it off its foundation, as the existing one had seriously deteriorated, threatening the building's structural integrity. Two years later the building was moved to its current site, to the south of its original location. Its new foundation was made of concrete blocks faced in stone to maintain the building's historic appearance. Another Eagle Scout repainted the exterior walls again in 1995. Two years afterward, when Ruth Miller Pinckney died, her estate left a bequest for the maintenance of the family plot. The following year, the porch columns were replaced. In 1999, a local couple who had just moved to Somers began exploring the town's historic sites. They found the West Somers church and cemetery heavily overgrown and \\"took pity on it.\\" They once again cleared the overgrowth and did some work on the building, repainting the exterior walls and restoring its porch in 2006. Their research led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Although mu () is also a generic term for radishes in Korean (as daikon is a generic term for radishes in Japanese), the word is usually used in its narrow sense, referring to the Joseon radish (, Joseonmu). In the context of Korean cuisine, the word Joseon is often used in contrast to Wae to distinguish Korean varieties from Japanese ones; the longer, thinner, and more succulent Japanese daikon cultivated mainly for danmuji is referred to as the Wae radish (, Waemu) in Korea. Korean radishes are generally shorter, stouter, and sturdier than daikon, and have a pale green shade halfway down from the top. They also have a stronger flavour, denser flesh and softer leaves. The greens of Korean radishes are called mucheong () and are used as a vegetable in various dishes.  Description  Korean radishes, like other radishes, are an annual or biennial crop grown for the taproots. The rotund cylindrical roots weigh about , being approximately long with their diameter around . The flesh of Korean radishes harvested timely is crisp, peppery and sweet. The upper part of the roots are subterranean stems, from which the long ovate leaves grow. The pinnated leaves with enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes are arranged in a rosette. The white to light purple flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence from April to May. Petals are twice as long as the calyx lobes, which are around . There is a pistillum and tetradynamous stamen. The fruits are small pods around , with hard shells and reddish-brown seeds.  Cultivation  Cultivation of radishes in Korea started in the Three Kingdoms era, and the crop was considered one of the most important in the Goryeo era. In 2015, radish is the most widely cultivated crop in South Korea, with a cultivation area of and an annual yield of 4.5 million tons. Korean radishes take about 3 months to grow. If properly cellar-stored in the unfrozen ground, the radishes harvested in autumn can be preserved until the spring.  Culinary use  Every part of the plant is used, from the taproot to the greens. It is an essential ingredient in soups, stews, and also for making a base broth for various dishes.

Later that year, his fianc√©e joined him and they were married in Winnipeg; they had two daughters. Hair worked for Saskatoon businessman John Clarence Drinkle as manager of Saskatoon‚Äôs first automatic telephone system, and later as manager of the Great West Furniture Company.

Hair was a member of Saskatoon city council in 1926, from 1928 to 1929, and from 1932 to 1933 as an alderman. He also served on the board of governors for the University of Saskatchewan. He had succeeded George Wesley Norman as the mayor of the city in 1930. He served as mayor till 1931 and was succeeded by Joseph Edwin Underwood. While attending a conference on unemployment in Winnipeg in summer 1930, Mayor Hair confidently declared that the situation in Saskatoon was \\"under control\\"; this evaluation was subsequently proven to be \\"terribly wrong\\".

He was also the founder and chairman of the Majelis Taklim Kwitang (the Islamic congregation of Kwitang; although Majelis Taklim itself literally means Board of Education) and Islamic Center Indonesia, which are the forerunners of other religious organizations in Jakarta. History Ali was born in the area of Kwitang in Central Jakarta on April 20, 1870 CE which was 20 Jumada al-Awwal 1286 AH. His father was Abdurrahman bin Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Habshi, an Arab Indonesian of Hadhrami- Sayyid descent. His father better known as Habib Cikini (d. 1879 CE) was born in Petak Sembilan, Semarang and was an Islamic scholar and preacher who lived in asceticism. His father died in 1879 CE when Ali was young and was buried in Cikini. His mother (born in Meester Cornelis) was a pious woman named Salmah (Nyai Salmeh), a daughter of a Betawi cleric from Kampung Melayu, East Jakarta. His father once married to Syarifah Rogayah bint Husen bin Alwi bin Awal bin Yahya, the younger sister of Raden Saleh, but from this marriage they did not have any offspring. Besides Ali, Abdurrahman had another son named Abdul Qadir, the younger brother of Ali who married to Sidah, the daughter of Habib Usman bin Yahya. Only from Ali the lineage of Abdurrahman continued as Abdul Qadir had only three daughters (the Arab society is patrilineal). Among students of Habib Abdurahman was Habib Ahmad Bin alwi al- Haddad, known as Habib Kuncung, who is buried in Kalibata, which is known for his piety and sanctity. His grandfather was Habib Abdullah bin Muhammad al- Habshi was born in Pontianak, West Kalimantan. He married a Semarang girl and had a son named Abdurrahman, and later in Pontianak he married another girl of Bansir family and had a son named Ali, who later moved to Gorontalo, settled and built a family there. Abdullah died on his sailing back to Pontianak, where the ship sunk in Java sea near Sukadana in 1833 CE (1249 AH). According to some sources, the ship sunk while fighting against \\"Lanun\\", a term used by people in Pontianak for pirates. Habib Ali Kwitang's great-grandfather, Muhammad al-Habshi was a wulayti, came from Hadhramaut and lived in Pontianak but died in Taribah, Hadhramaut. He married to the princess of Pontianak Sultanate of Algadri clan from the dynasty of al-Qadiriyyah al-Hashimiyyah. Ali was a Sayyid and his lineage traces back to Imam Ali as recorded as follows: Ali bin Abdurrahman bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Husein bin Abdurrahman bin Husein bin Abdurrahman bin Hadi bin Ahmad Shahib Syi'ib bin Muhammad al-Ashghar bin Alwi bin Abubakar al-Habshi bin Ali bin Ahmad bin Muhammad Assadilah bin Hasan al-Turabi bin Ali bin Muhammad al-Faqih Muqaddam bin Ali ibn Muhammad Shahib Mirbath bin Ali Khali' Qasam bin Alwi al-Tsani bin Muhammad bin Alwi al-Awwal bin Ubaidillah bin Ahmad al-Muhajir ibn Isa al-Rumi ibn Muhammad al-Naqib bin 'Ali al-Uraidhi ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq bin Muhammad al- Baqir ibn Zayn al-‚ÄòƒÄbdƒ´n ibn Husain ibn Ali bin Abu Talib and Fatimah daughter of Muhammad. =Early life= Abdurahman asked his wife, Nyi Salmah, to ensure that his son, Ali, was schooled in Hadhramaut and Mecca as It was common for Betawi people to send their children to the Middle East for religious education. When Ali reached about 11 years old, he went to Hadhramaut to study Islam from 1881 CE to 1886 CE. The first place he went was rubath Habib 'Abdur Rahman ibn' Alwi al-'Aydrus. There he learned from the scholars, among others, Habib 'Ali ibn Muhammad al-Habshi (the author of Mawlid book Shimthud Durar), Habib Hasan bin Ahmad al-'Aydrus, Habib Zain bin 'Alwi Ba'Abud, Habib Ahmad bin Hasan al-'Aththas and Shaikh Hasan bin 'Awadh. He also had the opportunity to study in al-Haramain (the Land of the Two Holy Mosques) during 1887-1889 and studied under Habib Muhammad bin Husain al-Habshi (Mufti of Mecca), Sayyid Abu Bakr al-Bakri Syatha al-Dimyati, Shaikh Muhammad Said Babsail, and Shaikh 'Umar Hamda. His passion to study never stopped, even after his return to Indonesia in 1889. He studied with a number of prominent scholars in Jakarta, including Habib Usman bin Yahya the mufti of Batavia, the marabout Habib Abdullah bin Muhsin Alatas in Empang, Bogor (his favorite teacher in Indonesia), and Habib Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Muhdhar of Bondowoso. = Later life = At the age of 20 years, Habib Ali Kwitang married to Syarifah Aisha binti Ali Assegaf, a girl from Gedong Hijau, South Jakarta. From the marriage, Habib Ali had eight daughters (Rogayah, Fatimah, Khadijah, Maryam, Mahani, Zainab, Zahra, and Sa‚Äôdiyah) and two sons (Abdurrahman and Muhammad). His first child, Abdurahman, whom used to be called Wan Derahman, married a catholic woman of Dutch descent named Maria Van Engels (people later called her Wan Enon or Jidah Non, while her families call her Nonni) who then converted to Islam and changed her name to Mariam. Abdurrahman had a short life and died in 1940 long before his father died. Abdurahman was buried initially at Said Naum Cemetery in Tanah Abang, but later moved to Karet Cemetery. Children of the couple Abdurrahman and Mariam, among others, were Muhdhar (nickname: Adong) and Salmah (nickname: Dameh). Salmah or better known as Bu Dame' or mother Dame' (d. 2000) was the only one of granddaughters of Habib Ali who continued the dawah to women congregation in Kwitang. thumb Salat al-Gayb at Kwitang mosque in Jakarta led by Habib Ali, following the death of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor-General of Pakistan, September 14, 1948 In addition to preaching at a number of places, he also traded for living. While carrying his merchandises on horseback, Habib Ali began trading in Tanah Abang Market in 1900. Although he was busy trading, Habib Ali always kept his prayer times, which was then followed by many Muslim merchants at Tanah Abang market. Every day approximately 10 minutes before Dhuhr time, Ali closed his stall and carried most of his merchandise, followed by other traders. After midday Habib Ali no longer open his stall, but did trade while preaching to the planned destination of each days. Such condition followed by other traders, in such that the Tanah Abang market at the time was then called Tanah Abang Morning Market (because it open only in the morning). He did this until he reached 70 years old. Habib Ali was involved in the establishment of Jamiat Kheir in 1901 and Rabithah al-Alawiyah in 1928. Although he was not an active member of Jamiar Kheir, he gave spiritual support for the establishment. In 1928, Habib Ali held his first mawlid in front of Al Ma'mur Masjid or in the field of Jamiat Kheir Foundation in Tanah Abang, but later was held in Kwitang. Ali went for Hajj three times. First in 1311 AH or 1894 CE when Mecca was ruled by Aun Al-Rafiq Pasha, the second was in 1343 AH or 1925 CE when Hejaz was ruled by King Ali bin Hussein, and the third one was in 1354 AH or 1936 CE when the Hejaz was ruled by King Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. In the beginning of 1958 Habib Ali fell in the bathroom which resulted severe joints injury. His family refused Ali to get a surgery, because he was already more than 90 years old, so he just got regular treatment. He became partially paralyzed and almost always on wheelchair. In the last few years of his life Habib Ali spent his time reading the Koran at his veranda in Kwitang. Habib Ali even made his residence as a mosque named Awwabin and used it for Maghrib, Isha, and Fajr prayers in congregation with a number of his disciples. =Death= Habib Ali died Sunday on October 13, 1968, at 20:45 pm at the age of 98 years or around 103 years by Hijri calendar. His death received tremendous attention from his disciples and also Muslim communities in the country. The news of his death was even broadcast by a number of television and radio stations from Arab countries as well as Voice of America's broadcasting station to various countries. The only Indonesian TV broadcasting station at that time, TVRI, broadcast the news live about his death as well. When the news of his death spread out, thousands of people mourned and paid respects at the funeral home. Habib Ali Kwitang could be the only servant of God in Indonesia whose body was bathed with the Zam Zam water. On the day of his funeral, the Indonesian government decided to make the day of funeral as National day of mourning and expected people to install flag at half-mast in honor of his services to the nation and state. At the time when the body was going to be moved from the house to the cemetery, it could not be moved due to the large number of mourners filled the Kramat II street to the Arriyadh Mosque. The body was then carried passing over the heads of thousands of mourners and it took about half an hour to arrive, even though the distance to the burial was only approximately from the residence of Habib Ali. Habib Salim bin Jindan appointed and initiated a Bay'ah to Ali's son Muhammad to continue his father's work. Since the death of Muhammad on December 12, 1993, the leadership of ICI is continued by Muhammad's son, Abdurrahman al-Habshi. The death of Habib Ali Kwitang according to Hamka was very big loss for the nation, because Habib Ali's struggle for preaching had made many people in Jakarta became better Muslims. Hamka also acknowledged that Habib Ali was the descendant of Muhammad the prophet of Islam and played very important role in the struggle of Indonesian people, so he should deservedly get a high respect. Career During Dutch East Indies ruling, there was a rebellion against the government in Priangan area. The Dutch government sought help to Habib Ali Kwitang to mediate a ceasefire with the Priangan Muslims in the region. Fortunately Habib Ali Kwitang successfully mollified the Priangan people, so they would stop the war. This incident pleased the Dutch Colonial, so it gave the Medal of Honor to Ali for his contribution to reconcile the dispute. In addition to tasuwir (the betawi term for a Sermon at the time), he also authored a number of books, such as al-Azhar Al-Wardiyyah fi al-Shuurah An- Nabawiyyah (The character of the Prophet) and al-Durar Fi al-Shalawat al-Khair al-Bariyyah (book about shalawat). He also used yellow books (a term for classic religious books; usually printed in yellow paper) written by Abdullah ibn Alawi al-Haddad, a scholar living in Hadramaut about 300 years ago who wrote the famous Ratib Haddad. There was already a mosque in Kwitang in 1910 called al-Riyadh Musholla. In order to strengthen the preaching task, in 1918 Habib Ali expanded the mosque, where next to it he later built a madrasah named Madrasah Unwanul Falah. The land used to build the mosque was a waqf partially provided by a Betawi of Kwitang, Haji Jilani (Mad Jilani) and by Sayyid Abdurrahman bin Syech AlKaff. Many scholars in Jakarta had been his students or had studied at the madrasah. In 1911 Ali founded Majelis Taklim Kwitang (the activity of congregation in Majelis Taklim is mostly listening to sermon given by the preacher) on Kwitang II street. In relatively short time, his activity attracted many people, including from the suburbs such as Ciputat, Condet, even Depok. Because there was no city bus at that time, some of his disciples came by train, but mostly by horse-powered wagons. On April 20, 1963, he was in the committee to renovate the mosque for its third time. The committee consisted of government officials as well as Ulamas. On May 8, 1963, some newspapers in Jakarta, the Indonesian news agency Antara carried story about the Masjid Kwitang renovation with dome and minarets. A number of other Betawi scholars who had studied to him and some even open other Majelis Taklim were Thahir Rohili (the founder of al-Thahiriyyah), Abdullah Syafi'i (the founder of Assyafi'iyyah), Fathullah Harun (later migrated to Malaysia), Abdulrazak Mamun and Zayadi. Although these people were his disciples, Habib Ali treat them like his own family. He often visited them at their home. In his Majelis Taklim, they were always given the opportunity to give a speech. Later, Habib Salim bin Jindan, who was famous for hist fiery speeches, joined him. Habib Ali (front row: third from the left) with other founding members of Jamiat Kheir. As a well-known scholar, Habib Ali preached at many places in Indonesia. He also had students from Singapore and Malaysia. In addition, he also had traveled to many countries, such as Pakistan, India, Colombo, and Egypt. Habib Ali was known not only in Southeast Asian countries (such as Malaysia, Singapore, or Thailand), but also in African and Middle East countries. Habib Ali began to perform Mawlid every last Thursday of Rabi' al- awwal since the death of Muhammad ibn Habib Idrus Al-Habshi in 1920 CE (1338 AH) until 1937 CE (1355 AH) at Jamiat Kheir and later moved to al-Riyadh mosque. Habib Ali also played an important role in the establishment of Al- Rabithah al-Alawiyyah in 1928 and its sub-organization, al-Maktab Daimi in around 1940. Habib Ali was respected by many Indonesian officials and also befriend with Sukarno. A few days before the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Habib Ali Kwitang offered his residence for Sukarno to stay overnight before proclaiming the independence to avoid threats from the Dutch Empire. During his stay at Habib Ali Kwitang's residence, Sukarno always followed spiritual activities in Habib Ali's assembly and congregation. The assembly invoked a lot of prayers for safety of Sukarno and for the independence which would be proclaimed on the August 17, 1945 CE which was also in the month of Ramadan. In 1963, Sukarno planned to visit his congregation but due to various factors could not attend, so he instead sent the Indonesian Prime Minister at the time, Djuanda Kartawidjaja. In March 1965, during Asian-African Islamic Conference (KIAA), the heads of state and guests were ushered to Habib Ali's Majelis Taklim Kwitang by the chief of staff of the armed forces of Indonesia who was the Minister of Defence, General Abdul Haris Nasution. Leaders of the Muslim World League during their visit to Indonesia also paid a visit to Habib Ali. Similarly, Soeharto, B.J. Habibie, Abdurrahman Wahid, and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono at least have visited the place once. Traditionally, every new elected governor of Jakarta would visit the shrine of Habib Ali. Legacies According to Mohammad Asad bin Ali bin Ahmad Shahab who knew Habib Ali Kwitang for decades, Habib Ali's assembly could survive for more than a century as the core teachings of Islam because the materials he offered were peaceful, full of akhlaq, monotheistic, contained purity of faith, social solidarity, and noble morality. Although traditionally Habib Ali and his future generations follow Shafi'i Madhhab for fiqh and Ba 'Alawiyya for everything else, one of his grandsons, Ali Ridha bin Muhammad, is a shiah scholar, graduated from Qom in 1974. Habib Ali's Majlis of Mawlid is still hold annually to date in Jakarta, and is usually attended by thousands of people from many places, including foreign countries.

History The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) built a bike trail parallel to I-275 in the mid-1970s. This I-275 Bikeway was constructed as a reply to the 1970s energy crisis, along a stretch in Monroe, Wayne and Oakland counties. This path is wide and runs at least from the freeway, fenced off from adjacent landowners. It was not well- maintained originally, but it was being improved in the first decade of the 21st century. There are 24 access points to the trail located at major cross roads along the route. The trail is one of a network approved in June 1974, and the state originally planned it to follow almost all of I-275 at the time, including the unbuilt segment north of Novi. Since 2006, the Michigan Trails & Greenway Alliance and MDOT have been working to improve the bike trail. At the time of the alliance's initial studies, the trail was overgrown with vegetation in locations. The study focused on areas of needed improvement after meeting with members of the public in the communities surrounding the bike path. In August 2009, MDOT held an open house to discuss construction work planned to improve the trail. Further impacts by MDOT to the bikeway included closures in 2010 during reconstruction projects underway on the I-275 freeway. Since a grand re-opening in 2011, the bike path has been called the I-275 Metro Trail. In the middle of 2015, MDOT completed reconstruction of the bike trail, resulting in a paved trail from a junction with the Downriver Linked Greenways East‚ÄìWest Trail near South Huron Road northward to 12 Mile Road in Novi.

It is known for its use of complicated and colorful fabric patterns, including contrasting patterns inside the cuffs of its shirt sleeves. History Robert Stock is a native of Bronx, New York whose interest in fashion was influenced by his father, a mechanic and gas station owner who liked to wear bright, colorful, patterned shirts. He began his career working for small New York-based menswear designer Paul Ressler, but in 1970 created his own line called Country Britches. While still working at a local men's store in the Bronx, he met fellow New York designer Ralph Lauren when Lauren entered the store as a tie salesman. The two became friends and Stock sold his own company to collaborate with Lauren on his Chaps collection. The two parted in 1975 for Stock to launch his own Country Roads line, for which he won a Coty Award for Best American Sportswear Designer and a Cutty Sark Award for Leading American Men's Wear Designer. He then developed his Robert Stock Designs brand, growing internationally, until forming Robert Graham. The idea that would become Robert Graham came after meeting Graham Fowler, a French textile designer. The two launched the new label in 2001. Fowler left the following year to pursue other projects while Stock remained to serve as Co-Chairman and Chief Creative Officer. Robert Graham has 21 retail stores and 12 outlet stores, and is sold by independent boutiques as well as large department store chains like Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Sak's Fifth Avenue, and Bloomingdale's. It has a flagship store on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. Design Stock and Fowler intended to fill a menswear niche \\"that craved pops of color and interesting, conversation-provoking pieces,\\" a style Stock would later call \\"American Eclectic.\\" By offering sizes up to 4XL, the brand has been able to expand upon that niche to customers not typically served by luxury fashion labels. In addition to bright colors and patterns, Robert Graham shirts use contrasting patterns and embroidery on inward-facing surfaces such as inside shirt cuffs, under collars, and along the button line. Printed or embroidered on every garment is the company motto \\"Knowledge Wisdom Truth.\\" The unusual, frequently hidden details have become as closely identified with the brand as the outward patterns. Though it began with and continues to focus on menswear, and men's shirts in particular, the brand has branched out to pants, shorts, sport coats, outerwear, neckwear, accessories, hats, shoes, and denim. In 2005 the company began production of womenswear as well, using the same kinds of color, contrast, and detail-heavy aesthetics. In addition to its main line, the company has offered a number of sub-labels with slightly different aesthetics: the more elaborate, higher-end Limited Edition and Zen lines; the more subtle, slim-cut X Collection; a more casual line named after the very first Robert Graham collection, Freshly Laundered Shirt Co.;; and more traditional patterns in the RG line. All of the fabrics used in Robert Graham shirts are designed in-house and, according to Stock, the embroidery is done such that no two shirts are identical. After discovering \\"collectors\\" among customers, the company began its Collector's Club promotion, rewarding those with more than 100 shirts by naming a shirt after them. , Robert Graham produces four menswear collections and one women's wear collection per year. In 2012 Stock designed a collection of Robert Graham sunglasses and prescription eyeglass frames for Revolution Eyewear and in 2014 the company licensed its name to Batallure Beauty to develop a line of fragrances and personal care products. Popular culture Detail of Townsend Bell's #24 Robert Graham sponsored car at the Indianapolis 500 American Idol judge Randy Jackson frequently wears Robert Graham shirts on the show and the contrasting shirt cuffs have become closely identified with the character Cameron Tucker from the television show Modern Family. Race car driver Townsend Bell was noted for wearing a Robert Graham polka dotted fedora at the 2013 Indianapolis 500. For the 2014 race, Bell brought the company on as a primary sponsor of his KV Racing Technology Number 6 car. Both the exterior and, unusually, the interior of the car display characteristic colors, patterns, and logos. Bell's racing crew uniforms and firesuit were likewise custom designs. Robert Graham also sponsored Bell's subsequent Number 24 and Number 29 cars, which raced in the 2015 and 2016 Indianapolis 500s, respectively. According to Stock, the company has an interest in motorsports predating sponsorship of Bell, due to a noted overlap in customers and a suggestion by Bill Sweedler, a race car driver and financial manager whose firm, Tengram Capital Partners, owns a majority interest in the company.
