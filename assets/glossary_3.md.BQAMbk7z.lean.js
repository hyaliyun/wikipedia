In March 2017, Bear 71 was re-released as a virtual reality work, viewable on Google Daydream and Google Cardboard. Story Following Bear 71, the web documentary explores the connections between the human and animal world, and the far-ranging effects that human settlements, roads and railways have on wildlife. The webdoc features a map of Banff National Park that allows users to follow Bear 71's movements by scrolling over the cameras, and look at other users by activating the computer's webcam. Production Through the work of Leanne Allison's husband and film collaborator Karston Heuer (Being Caribou, Finding Farley), a park ranger at Banff, Allison was aware of thousands of hours of wildlife footage captured on remote trail cameras in the park. After obtaining permission from researchers, including Parks Canada, Alberta Provincial Parks and Montana State University, she spent months sifting through these low-res images. Allison originally pitched the idea to the NFB as a traditional documentary. Rob McLaughlin, then head of the National Film Board of Canada's digital studio in Vancouver, suggested an interactive project. The 20-minute story was written by J.B. MacKinnon, co-author of the 100 Mile Diet. The bear is voiced by Mia Kirshner. The project was created with the two co-directors working remotely: Allison is based in Canmore, Alberta and Mendes, in Vancouver. The site was designed by Toronto-based digital design firm Jam3. Release Bear 71 went live on the NFB website on January 19, 2012. It was also the subject of an installation at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival's New Frontier program beginning January 20, followed by the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art. DOXA Documentary Film Festival is opening its 2012 season with a public performance of Bear 71 at St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church, with a live musical accompaniment by Tim Hecker, Loscil and Heather McIntosh. Awards In June 2012, Jam3 received a Gold Cyber Lion Award the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in the category of Charities, Public Health & Safety and Public Awareness Messages, for their work on Bear 71. Also in June 2012, Sheffield Doc/Fest awarded Bear 71 the Sheffield Innovation Award sponsored by BT Vision. In December 2012, Bear 71 was named the best non-fiction web series at the Digi Awards (formerly Canadian New Media Awards). On January 15, 2013, Bear 71 was named Site of the Year for 2012 by the Favourite Website Awards. On April 30, 2013, Bear 71 received the Webby Award for best net art.

Francois- Xavier Lalanne was born in Agen, France, and received a Jesuit education. At age 18, he moved to Paris and studied sculpture, drawing and painting at Acad√©mie Julian. In 1948 Lalanne worked as an attendant at the Louvre in the Oriental Antiques section.Marchesseau, D. (1998). The Lalannes. Flammarion. p. 27. Francois-Xavier rented a studio in Montparnasse, next door to friend Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, after completing mandatory military service. Br√¢ncu»ôi introduced Lalanne to artists such as Max Ernst, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, and Jean Tinguely. He met Claude Lalanne at his first gallery show in 1952. The show signified an end of painting for Fran√ßois-Xavier as he and Claude began their career sculpting together. Claude Lalanne became known to the larger public in France in 1976 when the singer Serge Gainsbourg selected one of her works, \\"The man with the head of a cabbage\\", for the title and cover of an album of his. Chatsworth Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 597020 In 1983 Lalanne was commissioned by the French Ministry of Culture to design new monumental fountains for the square in front of the H√¥tel de Ville, Paris, and also to design gardens for the reconstructed Les Halles in the center of Paris.Andre Hoffman, La Creation Contemporaine, Paris et Ses Fontaines, de la Renaissance a nos jours. Collection Paris et son patrimoine, Paris, 1995. Claude Lalanne (1924‚Äì2019) was born in Paris and studied architecture at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts and at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs. She involved herself in the artist community in Impasse Ronsin, Montparnasse, Paris and became friends with American artists Larry Rivers and Jimmy Metcalf who helped her develop the art of electroplating. Les Lalanne are represented by the Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York City and Ben Brown Fine Arts in London. Artworks and exhibitions The themes explored by the two collectively went against the current trend of Abstract art in the 1960s. The couple believed and Francois-Xavier claimed, \\"the supreme art is the art of living.\\" The couple began attracting public attention in Paris during the 1960s when Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg√© commissioned them. In particular, Francois-Xavier's realistic bronze cast sheep covered in skin alongside lily vanes cast by Claude were displayed in the library of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg√©. Their first exhibition together included Francois-Xavier's famous rhinoceros desk, Rhinocr√©taire, and Claude's cabbage with chicken legs sculpture. Similar themes by Les Lalanne have classified their works as an ode to Surrealism and Art Nouveau. \\"The Dinosaurs of Santa Monica\\" (1989) by Claude and Francois-Xavier Lalanne, Santa Monica, California Claude and Fran√ßois-Xavier Lalanne were known to co-create on projects rather than collaborate. While Fran√ßois-Xavier favored sculpting animal themes, Claude preferred vegetation. These themes are vividly paired in their 1989 public art installation of topiary fountains for the City of Santa Monica's popular Third Street Promenade entitled The Dinosaurs of Santa Monica, where six 15-foot tall topiary dinosaurs spew jets of water. Pomme de Londres (2007) In recent years, the works of Les Lalanne have been exhibited in different venues in New York City. In 2009, the artist duo participated in Park Avenue Recession Art, an effort developed by the Paul Kasmin Gallery, the New York City Parks Department‚Äôs public-art division and the Fund for Park Avenue Sculpture Committee. The project involved a series of sculptures in between crosswalks on Park Avenue. The pieces featured were a bronze apple called \\"Pomme de New York\\" on 52nd Street, \\"Moutons\\" on 53rd Street, \\"Choupatte (Tr√®s Grand)\\" on 56th Street, and \\"Singe Avis√© (Tr√®s Grand)\\" on 58th Street, which was Fran√ßois-Xavier's last sculpture.

In the painting, a contemplative Lincoln is observed alone, leaning forward in a chair, with his elbow on his knee and his head resting on his hand. Lincoln's pose was inspired by Healy's 1868 painting, The Peacemakers, which depicts Lincoln and others in an historic 1865 strategy session of the Union high command, during the final days of the American Civil War. History Lincoln sat for Healy in August 1864, and Healy began working on his sketches to create a portrait of Lincoln. After Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, Healy conceived of The Peacemakers, which he completed in 1868. In 1869, 4 years after the assassination of Lincoln, Healy decided to create a new portrait removing the members of Lincoln's high command to focus only on Lincoln. He painted the portrait in Paris. On March 3, 1869, an act of Congress authorized the commission of a portrait of Lincoln to hang in the White House. As a result, Healy sent it to Washington, hoping it would be chosen. However, Ulysses S. Grant, then the President of the United States selected a portrait painted by William F. Cogswell. Robert Todd Lincoln, Lincoln's son, purchased Healy's portrait. He said of Healy's portrait: \\"I have never seen a portrait of my father which is to be compared with it in any way.\\" The portrait was owned by Robert Todd Lincoln's widow, Mary Harlan Lincoln, who bequeathed it to her daughter, Mamie Lincoln Isham, with the understanding that it would be eventually given to the White House. It entered the White House collection after Isham's death in 1938. It hangs in the State Dining Room of the White House. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson identified the painting as one of her favorites in the White House. Though Richard Nixon had moved the portrait from the State Dining Room, replacing it with Palisades on the Hudson, Gerald Ford had the portrait moved back to its longstanding placement. A reproduction of the portrait hangs in the Illinois Governor's Mansion in Springfield, Illinois and the Minnesota House of Representatives chamber behind the speaker's chair.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its architectural significance. with History The building was built for G. F. Andrae in 1894. The architect was Oscar Cobb of Chicago, Illinois. It was originally known as the Grand Opera House, and first opened as a vaudeville and stage theater. G. F. Andrae was a German immigrant and well-known business man in Stevens Point. He was responsible for building a few buildings in town, including the Andrae Block. The Opera House was his way of giving back to the city. His descendants owned the building until September 2020. The Opera House Now For the Opera House (From The Gazette, July 19, 1893.) This forenoon G. F. Andrae secured the deed for the ground upon which he will erect a new Opera House. The ground has a frontage of fifty-five feet on Main Street, and extends thought to Brown Street, the consideration being $4,165. Mr. Andrae has also purchased the lot on Brown Street, adjoining on the west, giving plenty of ground room on the rear for entrance, storage purposes, etc. The property was formerly owned by Henry and J. D. Curran. The contract has been let for moving the building, now occupied as a Chinese laundry, to Brown Street, and the building will be moved on Monday next. The contract for excavation for the basement has also been made, and work upon the same will be commenced at once. Mr. Andrae as has been stated before, has already received a number of plans, but the one he is most favorably impressed with is that furnished by a Chicago architect, who will be here today or tomorrow and look the ground over. This is something that Stevens Point has long needed, and it is a pleasure to be able to announce that the Andrae Opera House will be pushed forward to completion as fast as men can do the work and money provide the material, and that it will be erected in a model style and supplied with the latest and most approved furnishing and conveniences. Vitascope was played at the Grand (the first motion pictures) on February 11, 1897. The Grand Opera House closed on February 3, 1915. The Majestic Theater The Majestic Theater was the next name of the theater. The stage house and dressing rooms were added to rear of the building, and the box seats were removed to create a larger auditorium. The theater reopened on November 1, 1920 with a performance of \\"All Aboard For Cuba.\\" The Fox was remodeled in July‚ÄìAugust 1941. A new canopy was built which is still in use today. New sound equipment, projection machines, and an air-conditioning system were installed. A new concrete fireproof floor, with a new pitch was installed on the main floor. The front row was raised 18 inches and the back row was raised eight inches. New seats were installed reducing the seating capacity to 772. The main floor had 568 seats. The front of the balcony had a smoking section with 72 seats. The regular seating section in the upper balcony had 132 seats. The main colors in the theater were burgundy and the lobbies were green turquoise and yellow. The ladies rest room and lounge were enlarged. The Fox reopened on August 14, 1941 with the movie \\"Life Begins For Andy Hardy.\\" In May 1954 CinemaScope was installed along with a new sound system. \\"The Robe\\" was the first widescreen movie at the Fox. The Fox closed for a short time on May 22, 1955; it reopened on July 25, 1955. Later, it was operated by United Artists Theaters in the 1960s - 1970's. Rogers Cinema operated the theater for a short time before some of the theaters were sold to Essaness Theaters. It was last operated by Essaness Theaters before closing in 1986. The cities mall project in the early 1980s led to the forced removal of the stage and dressing area, and the heating units which were also in that area. The theater only operated for a short time after the removal of the stage. The last 2 movies that played in the Fox were Off Beat at 5:30 and Out of Africa at 7:30. The announcement that the theater was closed came out on April 25, 1986. Efforts to reopen the Fox Multiple efforts have been made to re-open the theater. In 2006, the theater's marquee was restored by the family and its lights were turned on periodically. In January 2011, the Sanders family announced it planned to redevelop the theater if Stevens Point voters approved almost $6 million in funding to revitalize the mall area. Voters approved the referendum later that year. The Sanders family ‚Äî Ada, Donald and Jeanette ‚Äî talked with the Arts Alliance of Portage County about the donation. It was a joint effort by Art Alliance of Portage County Board President, Bill Schierl and Ada Sanders, the granddaughter of G. F. Andrae. On February 1, 2013, the Arts Alliance of Portage County, Inc. formally accepted the donation of the Fox Theatre from Ada, Donald and Jeanette Sanders. ‚ÄúMy brother, sister and I have been waiting a long time for the right opportunity to contribute the Fox to the cultural vitality of our community‚Äù, commented Ada Sanders. ‚ÄúIt has always been our goal to see the Fox reopened‚Äù. The alliance formed a committee to develop and operate the theater as the nonprofit Fox Theatre, LLC. The committee was to be led by Gerard McKenna, former dean of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point‚Äôs College of Fine Arts and Communication. Famous people that were on stage at the Fox Harry Houdini performed on April 7 and 8, 1897. Eugene V. Debs spoke at the Grand on January 6, 1904.

Its building and opening was championed by major local political figures in the 1980s and 1990s but was also an ongoing source of controversy in the area. Opening The development opened in August 1999. The building of Renaissance Summit and the surrounding areas was mired in controversy and Los Angeles politics in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Existing residents of the Porter Ranch area feared the increased traffic that would be brought by the planned building of an area commercial complex to service the new homes being built. The community had also been criticized for destroying the natural beauty of the brush and wild areas that inhabited the space before the houses were built. The ceremony for the opening of the subdivision was unusually packed with Los Angeles political elite, including Mayor Richard Riordan, City Council President John Ferraro, City Councilman Hal Bernson, and Police Chief Bernard Parks. It was built by Shapell Homes, a company founded by Nathan Shapell, an Auschwitz survivor, philanthropist, and major Los Angeles builder . Homes and administration Renaissance Summit has been described as a \\"bastion of luxury\\" located on the slopes of the Santa Susana Mountains. It offers a high viewpoint looking down on other neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley, including Reseda, Canoga Park, and Sherman Oaks. Houses average 4,000 square feet. Design styles include Spanish Colonial, classic Italianate, Tuscan, coastal, and American traditional. The development's security is strict, with visitors unable to enter through the community gate unless their names are on a guest list. In 2006, the development's homeowner association and property management firm, Ross Morgan & Company, drew attention when they demanded that a homeowner remove a flagpole from her property on which an American flag was hoisted.

It is a member of the Indiana-Michigan Mennonite Conference of Mennonite Church USA. History Members of Prairie Street Mennonite Church illustrating plain Mennonite clothing (back row, right: Elsie (Kolb) Bender, Harold S. Bender's mother). Prairie Street began in 1870 as a gathering of Mennonites who lived in Elkhart and regularly attended other churches in the county, such as Yellow Creek Mennonite Church, and Shaum Mennonite Church (now Olive Mennonite Church) which met every other week. John F. Funk bought a plot of land for the church building just outside the city limit to allay concerns about how the Mennonite faith would hold up in an urban context. The first meeting in the current location, on the eponymous Prairie Street, took place on 26 November 1871. In 1879, John S. Coffman was invited by John F. Funk to join the staff of the Herald of Truth and he began attending Prairie Street Mennonite Church, where he promoted Sunday school and preached. Other noted early leaders at Prairie Street Mennonite include: *Daniel H. Bender *George L. Bender *H. B. Brenneman *John E. Hartzler, who served as president of Goshen College from 1913-1918. *Jonas S. Hartzler, pastor at Prairie Street from 1923-1940, had previously taught at the Elkhart Institute and then at Goshen College. *A. B. Kolb, who authored the Mennonite hymn \\"Christ who Left His Home in Glory.\\" *Menno Steiner In 1895, Prairie Street Mennonite Church member Lewis Kulp purchased 5 acres of land on what is now Hively Avenue, and the Prairie Street Cemetery was created. Land was added to the property over many years. In 1998, the church donated the cemetery and surrounding undeveloped land to the City of Elkhart. In 1931, the Prairie Street Mennonite Church building was burned in a fire so severely that it needed to be rebuilt. Fourteen men from Prairie Street drafter during World War II opted to participate in the Civilian Public Service rather than participate in combat. =Women's Contributions= In 1934, Prairie Street women began canning fruits and vegetables for use at Goshen College, and during World War II, they did the same for Civilian Public Service camps, Mennonite Voluntary Service, and Bethany Christian Schools. Nellie Mann Witmer, Minnie Graber, and Juanita Mann Wittrig, all Prairie Street members, served as president of the Indiana- Michigan Women's Missionary and Service Commission and Graber also served as the president of the church-wide WMSC from 1958-1969. =Innovations= Prairie Street was the first Mennonite church in its conference to: *Have a Christmas Program (1890) *Hold a church wedding (1894) *Begin a Young People's Meeting (1897) *Commission Missionaries (1899) *Begin a Sewing Circle (1895) Both Mennonite Central Committee and Mennonite Mission Network began in part through the initiative of Prairie Street Mennonite Church. Prairie Street was instrumental in beginning Belmont Mennonite Church and True Vine Tabernacle (Formerly Roselawn Mennonite Church), also in Elkhart, Indiana, and Pleasant View Mennonite Church in Jefferson Township, Elkhart County, Indiana. Today As of 2006, Prairie Street Mennonite Church had an average attendance of 130. Located in a neighborhood equal parts African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic, Prairie Street initiated programs designed to reach out to the community, including Vacation Bible School (with Hively Avenue Mennonite), neighborhood block parties, and Jubilee House, a unit of Mennonite Voluntary Service. Congregation members often volunteer as tutors at the local elementary school. Prairie Street Mennonite partnered with the Elkhart Area Ministerial Association to organize tutoring in English as a Second Language, hosting the tutoring. Prairie Street Mennonite Church pursued a partnership with Community Missionary Baptist Church which is located down the street, through pulpit exchanges, joint tutoring, and an effort to save the local school building. =Mennonite Voluntary Service House= Prairie Street Mennonite Church sponsored Jubilee House, a unit of Mennonite Voluntary Service located adjacent to the church. In 2008, MVSers at Jubilee House appeared dressed as superheroes to promote awareness of male-pattern violence. In 2010, MVS workers began the Jubilee House Neighborhood Demonstration Garden. Using recycled and reused gardening equipment, they created a garden to educate neighbors about the possibilities of urban gardening as well as to provide some free produce. Some of Prairie Street Mennonite Church's historical records are housed in the Mennonite Church USA Archives, while others remain in the congregation's possession.

Both maritime and land-based variants of the system exist. Barak 8 was jointly developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), India's Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO), Israel's Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure, Elta Systems, Rafael and other companies. Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) produces the missiles. Background Barak 8 is loosely based on the original Barak 1 missile and is expected to feature a more advanced seeker, alongside range extensions that will move it closer to medium range naval systems like the RIM-162 ESSM or even the SM-2 Standard. Israel successfully tested the improved Barak II missile on July 30, 2009. The radar system provides 360 degree coverage and the missiles can take down an incoming missile as close as 500 meters away from the ship. Each Barak system (missile container, radar, computers and installation) costs about $24 million. In November 2009 Israel signed a $1.1 billion contract to supply an upgraded tactical Barak 8 air defence system to India. In May 2017, India placed an order of $630 million for four ships of the Indian Navy. In September 2018, MDL and GRSE awarded Bharat Electronics Limited with a $1.28 billion contract to supply seven Barak-8 air defence systems for Project 17A-class frigates. In October 2018, Bharat Electronics Limited signed a $777 million deal with Israel Aerospace Industries to help fulfil the Barak-8 order. Design Barak 8 launcher module The Barak 8 has a length of about 4.5 meters, a diameter of 0.225 meters at missile body, and 0.54 meters at the booster stage, a wingspan of 0.94 meters and weighs 275 kg including a 60 kg warhead which detonates at proximity. The missile has maximum speed of Mach 2 with a maximum operational range of 70 km, which was later increased to 100 km.Israel ship missile test for India , The Telegraph, 28 November 2015Gen Next missile defence shield built by Israel and India clears first hurdle , The Times of India, 28 November 2015 Barak 8 features a dual pulse rocket motor as well as Thrust vector control, and possesses high degrees of maneuverability at target interception range. A second motor is fired during the terminal phase, at which stage the active radar seeker is activated to home in on to the enemy track. Barak 8 has been designed to counter a wide variety of air-borne threats, such as; anti-ship missiles, aircraft, UAVs drones and supersonic missiles When coupled with a modern air-defence system and multi-function surveillance track and guidance radars, (such as the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR AESA on board the Kolkata-class destroyers) Barak 8 enables the capability to simultaneously engage multiple targets during saturation attacks.IAI PDF - Barak 8 , iai.co.il Israel Aerospace Industries describe Barak 8 as \\"an advanced, long-range missile defense and air defense system\\" with its main features being:IAI - Naval Barak 8 Israel Aerospace Industries * Long Range * Two way data link (GPS S band) * Active Radar Seeker Missile * 360 degree coverage * Smokeless propulsion * Thrust vector control * Dual pulse propulsion * Vertical Launch * Multiple Simultaneous Engagements * Point defence anti-ballistic missile  MRSAM  MRSAM is the land based configuration of the missile. It consists of a command and control system, tracking radar, missile and mobile launcher systems. Each launcher will have eight such missiles in two stacks and are launched in a canister configuration. The system is also fitted with an advanced radio frequency (RF) seeker. The Indian Army ordered five regiments of this version, which consists of about 40 launchers and 200 missiles for . It is expected to be deployed by 2023 with first deliveries commencing in 2020. LRSAM (Barak-8ER) An ER (extended range) variant of the Barak 8 is under development, which will see the missiles maximum range increased to 150 km. Designed to engage multiple beyond visual range threats, the low launch signature Barak-8ER is understood to retain the same autopilot/inertial navigation system and active radar seeker guidance as the Barak-8, although some modifications to the software and to the missile control surfaces are likely. The booster increases the length of the missile at launch from its current 4.5 m to nearly 6 m, although the length in flight after the booster has been jettisoned may be slightly less than the base Barak-8 missile, if a TVC is not present. The missile diameter and fin spans are thought to be the same as the base Barak-8. The booster weight is currently unknown, although the missile's weight after the booster has been jettisoned is the same as that for the current Barak-8 configuration. Levy said that initial operational capability (IOC) for Barak-8ER will first be declared for the naval variant, followed by IOC for the land variant. He declined to comment on a launch customer for Barak-8ER, but noted \\"existing Barak-8 customers will be interested in this configuration because it offers additional capability to their current system\\".

It was founded by private subscription in 1808, taking as models the Royal Institution and the London Institution, both at the time popular. History The Institution was formed, somewhat opportunistically, to provide a revenue-paying purpose for an assembly hall which had been constructed in Coram Street, north of new housing around Bloomsbury Square. Previous ventures at the building having failed, the proprietors \\"thought it expedient\\" to imitate the model of the Royal and London Institutions; to that end they organised a meeting of local residents, seeking 12,500 guineas at 25 guineas each from 500 subscribers. The objects of the Institution were the \\"gradual formation of a library, consisting of the most useful works in ancient and modern literature; the establishment of a reading room provided with the best foreign and English journals, and the periodical publications, and lectures on literary and scientific subjects. The books in the library will be circulated for reading among the proprietors.\\" The institution proper was in being by June 1808, 2,700 guineas being spent to purchase the premises and some 4,500 guineas on equipping a library and providing a stock of books. Two or three courses of scientific lectures were given per annum. In order to fund the institution's ongoing expenses and provide some guarantee of stability, subscribers paid a guinea per annum. The Institution was relatively long-lived; periodic mentions of it are found in the literature, such as a report of 1851 lectures there by Charles Richard Weld; an observation in Frederick Miller's 1874 St Pancras ‚Äì Past and Present noting that some of the premises had been given over to a wine merchant, but that the library continued to receive daily papers, and monthly and annual journals. The Institution survived until near the end of the century; the Post Office listed it in an 1881 directory, but it is found missing in the 1891 counterpart.

In March 1828, he escaped from the notorious Sarah Island prison with fellow convict Thomas Connolly, and the two were the first white men to pass through the Lake St Clair region. Assuming Goodwin was then taken on to Hobart, he is the first white man to have traversed Tasmania from west to east. Early life Goodwin was born in or near Northampton and was convicted of thieving at the Northampton Assizes on 3 March 1821. He was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude and, after several months on prison hulk Bellarophon in Woolwich, he sailed on the Lord Hungerford for Hobart. While a prisoner, he worked for Thomas Scott, assistant to Surveyor General, George Frankland and gained valuable knowledge about the Tasmanian interior. Escape In March 1828, Goodwin and another convict, Irishman, Thomas Connolly were part of a logging party on the Gordon River. The men took advantage of a job that didn't require them to return to Sarah Island at night and which provided them with rations in bulk which they could store for later. Over a two-week period, they fashioned a boat out of a pine log which they used to escape up river and which they only abandoned when faced with some unpassable falls. They were assisted by Goodwin's bushcraft and a compass which he had stolen from Scott. The exact route the men took is unknown but they would have probably followed either the Franklin River or Denison River, both of which flow into the Gordon, before heading east into the Vale of Rasselas. From there they would have passed Wyld's Craig before emerging at the Ouse River. As well as their prison rations, they survived on grass roots, berries, mushrooms and food scavenged from Aborigines. Four weeks after their escape, the men split up near the settlement of Ouse. Goodwin was recaptured, but Connolly was never heard of again. Pardon and surveying duties Due to his feat of endurance and his unique experience of the South West Wilderness, Goodwin was pardoned and seconded to several surveying expeditions including John Charles Darke's unsuccessful 1832 exploration of the area to the South of Wyld's Craig. Return to prison Goodwin's freedom was short-lived‚Äîhe was caught stealing in 1835 and was sent by personal order of Lieutenant Governor George Arthur to Norfolk Island. Convict Peak and Goodwins Creek near the confluence of the Gordon and Franklin Rivers in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park are named after James Goodwin.

The system uses five reservoirs and four power stations at steep variations in altitude. Works on the complex began in 1957 with the construction of Lake Limmern Dam and the Mutt, Tierfehd and Linthal Power Stations. The dam was complete in 1963 and the power stations were all operational by 1968, with an installed capacity of 340 MW. In 2009, a 140 MW pumped-storage component between Lake Limmern and Tierfehd Reservoir was commissioned. In 2010, construction began on the Linthal 2015 Project, which included the expansion of Lake Mutt and Tierfehd Reservoir, and the addition of the Limmern Power Station, a 1,000 MW pumped- storage component between Lake Mutt and Lake Limmern. Commissioning of the last unit in Limmern was completed by December 2017, bringing the total installed capacity of the system to 1480 MW. Design and operation Lake Mutt in 2006. The highest reservoir in the complex is Lake Mutt (Muttsee), situated at above sea level. It had an original storage capacity of , and was later expanded to during the Linthal 2015 expansion, to hold extra capacity for the new pumped-storage power station. Below Lake Mutt, the main reservoir in the complex is Lake Limmern (Limmernsee), which was created by a tall and long arch dam on the Limmern Creek. At an elevation of above sea level, it can store up to of water. At an elevation of above sea level in an adjacent valley, the Hintersand Balancing Reservoir has a storage capacity of . The central reservoir in the complex is the Tierfehd Balancing Reservoir, located at an altitude of above sea level. It was built in 1964 with an original storage capacity of , but was later expanded to during the Linthal 2015 expansion project. Finally, the Linthal Balancing Reservoir is located down in the valley at an elevation of above sea level, and withholds of water. It has a direct discharge into the Linth river. Between Lake Mutt and Lake Limmern are the Mutt Power Station, in service since 1965 containing a single 4.4 MW Pelton turbine, and the latest expansion to the complex, the Limmern Power Station, which completed commissioning in late 2017 and has four 250 MW Francis pump-turbine. This four reversible pump-turbines are of slip energy recovery variable-speed type. During periods of low demand, water can be pumped from Lake Limmern to Lake Mutt and when energy demand is high, the water is released down for generation. The same turbines that pump the water to Lake Mutt reverse into generator mode. The difference in elevation between the two lakes affords a net hydraulic head of . Lake Limmern also provides water to the Tierfehd Power Station further down in the valley for conventional hydroelectric generation and pumped-storage. This power station includes three 87 MW Pelton turbines, in service since 1964, and one 140 MW Francis reversible pump-turbine, that was added to the complex in 2009. Additionally, the Hintersand Balancing Reservoir provides water to two 20 MW Pelton turbines also within the Tierfehd Power Station. Also in this Power Station, a 34 MW electrically driven pump allows the transfer of water from Hintersand Reservoir up to Lake Limmern. Water used for power generation at Tierfehd is discharged into the Tierfehd Balancing Reservoir. The water in this reservoir can either be pumped back up to Lake Limmern or directed down to the Linthal Power Station, which has two 17.2 MW Pelton turbines. From there, the Linthal Power Station discharges the water into the Linthal Balancing Reservoir and into the Linth river.

The car replaced the Alpine A106 and was based on mechanical components from the Renault Dauphine. History The 108 was launched at the Paris Motor Show in autumn 1957, but initially production volumes were low and the company‚Äôs principal offering continued to be the older 106 model until 1960. The Alpine 106 had taken its name from the first three digits of the four-digit homologation number of the old Renault 4CV on which the car was based. Applying the same logic the new car should have been called 109 because it used mechanical components from the newer Renault Dauphine which was registered under the French homologation number 1090, but instead the new car, which inherited many of its non-mechanical components from the 106, was given the name Alpine 108. In this form, where the 106 had used an engine from the Renault 4CV, the new model, as launched in 1957, used the Gordini version of the 845 cc engine fitted in the Dauphine. 1960 saw the introduction of an Alpine 108 cabriolet and a 2+2 coup√©.Christian Descombes, Alpine, Label bleu, s√©rie et comp√©tition, √©ditions E.P.A. These versions were slightly longer than the original and featured a newly developed ‚Äúbeams and backbone‚Äù chassis with the beams at each end supporting cradles which carried respectively the engine at the rear and the steering mechanism at the front. This basic architecture would be used for Alpine sports cars until the Alpine A110 was phased out in 1977. These models, like the original coup√©, were assembled by Chappe et Gessalin, but with a wheelbase lengthened by . The mechanical elements were as before, with the Renault Dauphine engine offered in 845 cc or 904 cc form. By the time production of the 108 came to an end in 1965, fewer than 100 of these lengthened versions had been produced. The 108 played an important part in the transformation of Alpine into a mainstream (though always low volume) car producer. In 1960 an upgraded version of the model known as the Berlinette Tour de France replaced the original ‚Äúcoach‚Äù version of the car. The obvious visual difference was at the front, where the headlights were now integrated into the front wing behind a windcheating perspex cover. This was the model offered in the show rooms from autumn 1960 and which continued in production until 1965, preparing the way for the commercially more successful A110. Brazilian production The Brazilian A108 ‚Äì Willys Interlagos Berlinette, 1964 The A108 was also produced in Brazil, thanks to an agreement with Willys-Overland. Renamed as Willys Interlagos, the model was built in three versions: berlinette, coup√©, and convertible. The car also had a successful racing career. From 1962 to 1966, a total of 822 Interlagos were made in Santo Amaro, S√£o Paulo. References Further reading * Alpine. Tous les mod√®les. Toutes les ann√©es, par Dominique Pascal.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History Construction began in February 1901 promoted by Nevins and Son. The work of construction involved around 120 men and a steam 'devil' used to break up the road surface. Track was laid from Lansdown Castle to the south west of Cheltenham along Gloucester Road to the Calcutta Inn, St George‚Äôs Rd, St. George‚Äôs Place, St. James‚Äô Square to the Great Western Railway station, Clarence Street, North Street, Albion Street, Winchcombe Street, Prestbury Road then through Prestbury and Southam to the top of Cleve Hill, a route of . Electricity was drawn from the Corporation Electricity Company Manchester Street sub-station. During construction two employees, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Wells, were killed on a test run when the brakes failed on Cleve Hill. The initial line on the tramway was inspected by Colonel von Donop R.E on 15 August 1901. Services started on the initial route from Lansdown to Cleeve Hill on 22 August 1901. The extension works to Charlton Kings and Leckhampton started in 28 September 1904 and were completed in April 1905 when they were inspected by Major J.W. Pringle of the Board of Trade. The construction had involved 1,600 tons of granite setts from Scotland, up to 1,000 tons or rails from Leeds, electrification poles from Wednesbury, 15,500 yards of copper wire and 50 tons of fish-plates, tiebars and bolts. This produced 4.5 route miles of tramway of mixed single and double tracks. Eight new cars were obtained from British Thomson-Houston Co of Rugby.

Currently, it is also a church school. With The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 28, 2001 for its architectural significance. Holy Cross parish has roots going back to 1834, when Father Van den Broek established a chapel in the Bay Settlement area. Around 1852 Father Edward Daems bought land at the site of the current complex and the parish built a pine church building, which no longer exists. In 1862 the rectory was built next to the pine church. In 1868 a school was added, which no longer exists. Surviving buildings include: * The Holy Cross Church Rectory was built in 1862, a two-story cube with Italianate details, including a fine wooden bracketed cornice and a hipped roof. Walls are local limestone with quoins of cut stone. In 1900 a block of matching style and materials was added, probably as a kitchen. Another one-story addition was added around 1950. * The Old White Laundry is a simple one-story frame building built around 1870, on a stone foundation. The north-facing gable has an oculus window. The building is now used for storage and as a root cellar. * The bathhouse/outhouse, built around 1880 just south of the laundry, is a one- story cube with Italianate details matching the rectory. It is wooden, but the wood is scribed to look like limestone to match the rectory. Inside are two rooms. The front room was a washroom, and the back a privy. * The Sisters of St. Francis of the Holy Cross Convent consists of several sections. A frame convent was built in 1880 where the 1959 section now stands. In 1916, a two- story red brick building was added to the south of the 1880 section, designed by Foeller, Schober and Berners of Green Bay with Neo-Gothic details. It has a corner turret, a center bay, and a gable roof topped with a stone cross. In 1932 a three-story section was added to the north, designed by William E. Reynolds with Colonial Revival details. After a fire, in 1959 the original 1880 convent was replaced with a four-story brick section, joining the other two sections into a U-shaped floorplan. * The Rectory Garage was built in 1930, brick and stone in Craftsman style. * The current Holy Cross Church was built in 1931 to replace the original 1852 pine church. It was designed by William E. Reynolds of Green Bay in Romanesque Revival style, with an exterior of brown brick. The main entrance is flanked by two square towers, with the left tower larger and holding the original 1852 bell. Inside, the nave has a barrel-vaulted ceiling supported by columns.

Retrieved 29 January 2012. In 2013 The next generation Ekso GT with smart Variable Assist (marketed as SmartAssist outside the U.S.) software was released. It is the only exoskeleton available for rehabilitation institutions that can provide adaptive amounts of power to either side of the patient's body, challenging the patient as they progress through their continuum of care. The suit's patented technology provides the ability to mobilize patients earlier, more frequently and with a greater number of high intensity steps. April 1, 2016 the FDA cleared the Ekso GT to be used with stroke patients and spinal cord injury patients up to level C7 (ASIA D classification). They are the first and only exoskeleton company to be able to provide a rehabilitative exoskeleton for the stroke population. In 2017 Ekso Bionics released SmartAssist software in the US which is an upgrade to the Variable Assist software. SmartAssist allows for pre-gait activities in addition to gait training as well as advanced gait training techniques. The software upgrade also included updates for ease of use and to keep track of each patient's settings via a specific patient ID number. Ekso Bionics also launched Ekso Pulse which is a way to metrically track a patient's progression over the course of their rehab treatment via an online portal at the Ekso Bionics website. In June 2020, Ekso received FDA approval to use one of its products with patients suffering from traumatic brain injury.

She started her career in March 2007, working alongside her sister Io Shirai on the Japanese independent circuit for promotions such as Ice Ribbon, JWP Joshi Puroresu and Pro Wrestling Wave. In June 2010, the Shirais came together with fellow freelancer Kana to form the Triple Tails stable as part of which they began working most notably for Smash. After Io left the stable the following year, Mio and Kana continued working together as the tag team Triple Tails.S. Shirai remained a freelancer until January 2014, when she signed a four-way contract with Ice Ribbon, Oz Academy, Pro Wrestling Wave and Union Pro Wrestling. She retired from professional wrestling due to neck injuries in September 2015 at the age of 27, after which she started working as a referee. Professional wrestling career =Team Makehen (2007‚Äì2010)= Shirai made her professional wrestling debut on March 4, 2007, alongside her younger sister, with the two adopting the ring names Mio and Io Shirai, respectively (\\"Shirai\\" being Japanese for \\"Purple Thunder\\"). While both of the sisters initially kept much of their private lives, including their real names, a secret, Io's real name was released by Japanese authorities in May 2012 as . Mio, on the other hand, has managed to keep her real name a secret. In their debut match, the Shirai sisters teamed with Toshie Uematsu to face the trio of Erika Ura, Nozomi Takesako and Yuri Urai. Starting their careers as freelancers, the Shirai sisters represented Team Makehen, a stable made up of wrestlers trained by Tomohiko Hashimoto, in several independent promotions during their first year in the business, including Ibuki, Pro Wrestling Wave, JWP Joshi Puroresu, and Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. On October 19, 2008, Mio and Io made their debuts for one of Japan's largest professional wrestling promotions, All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), wrestling in a match, where they defeated the team of Kyoko Kimura and Mikado. From January to March 2009, the Shirais also made several appearances for another large promotion not usually known for female wrestling, Pro Wrestling Zero1. On April 29, the Shirai sisters won their first championship by defeating Moeka Haruhi and Tomoka Nakagawa in a tournament final to become the first TLW (Totally Lethal Wrestling) World Young Women's Tag Team Champions. Despite its name, the championship was owned and promoted by Pro Wrestling Wave. From July to November, the Shirais spent four months working for the Ice Ribbon promotion. On November 12, 2009, the Shirais entered Pro Wrestling Wave's Captain's Fall Six Person Tag Team Tournament, teaming with Gami, but the trio was defeated in their first round match by Ran Yu-Yu, Ryo Mizunami and Toshie Uematsu. However, the trio earned their way back into the tournament by defeating Misaki Ohata, Moeka Haruhi and Yumi Ohka in a consolation match later that same day. On November 25, the Shirais and Gami first defeated Bullfight Sora, Cherry and Kaoru in the semifinals and then Ayumi Kurihara, Kana and Shuu Shibutani in the finals to win the tournament. On December 23, the Shirais lost the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship to Misaki Ohata and Moeka Haruhi. On June 9, 2010, Mio entered the 2010 Catch the Wave tournament. After two draws and two losses, Shirai finished last in her block and did not advance in the tournament. =Triple Tails (2010‚Äì2011)= Shirai in December 2010 On June 19, 2010, the Shirai sisters formed the Triple Tails stable with fellow freelancer Kana, defeating Ayumi Kurihara, Hikaru Shida and Yoshiko Tamura in their first match together at a NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling event. As a result, the Shirais received a shot Kurihara's and Tamura's NEO Tag Team Championship on July 4, but were defeated by the defending champions. Triple Tails returned to its winning ways on August 29, by defeating Asami Kawasaki, Hikaru Shida and Nagisa Nozaki in a six-woman tag team match. On October 18, 2010, Shirai, working under the ring name Kitzune Nanoko, made her debut for AAA in Puebla, Mexico, where she teamed with Alissa Flash to defeat Cynthia and Esther Moreno in a tag team match. In Mexico, both Shirais worked under cat-like masks they would only wear for their entrances in Japan. On October 31, Shirai was renamed Kaguya, while her debuting little sister was given the ring name Oyuki. In their first match under the new names, Kaguya and Oyuki teamed with Yuriko in a six-person tag team match, where they were defeated by Cynthia Moreno, Gato Eveready and Mari Apache. During their stay in AAA, Kaguya and Oyuki became associates of the La Legi√≥n Extranjera (Foreign Legion) stable. On November 7, Kaguya and Oyuki defeated Faby and Mari Apache in a tag team match and afterwards stole Faby's AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship and Mari's AAA Reina de Reinas Championship belts. On November 15, the Apaches and Cynthia Moreno defeated Kaguya, Oyuki and Sexy Star in a six-woman tag team match. A week later, Kaguya, Oyuki and Jennifer Blake defeated Moreno and the Apaches in another six-woman tag team match. This would turn out to be Kaguya's and Oyuki's final AAA appearance, which resulted in the storyline with the Apaches being dropped without a conclusion. Upon the Shirais' return to Japan, Triple Tails made its debut as a unit for Pro Wrestling Wave on December 19, defeating Cherry, Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa in the six-woman tag team main event. On January 29, 2011, the Shirais made their debuts for Smash, when the Triple Tails stable attacked Yusuke Kodama and Makoto after their matches, with the trio being both times chased out of the ring by Tajiri. On February 13, Triple Tails produced its first own event, where the Shirai sisters wrestled male tag team Momo no Seishun Tag (Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada) in a losing effort. On February 25, the Shirais made their Smash in-ring debuts at Smash.14, where they teamed with Kana to defeat Ken Ohka, Tajiri and Yoshiaki Yago in an intergender six-person tag team match. In March, Triple Tails took part in Osaka Pro Wrestling's Spring Samba Series, going undefeated in six-person tag team matches for the duration of the tour. On April 30 at Smash.16, Triple Tails was defeated in a six-woman tag team match by Makoto, Serena and Syuri. On May 3 at Smash.17, the Shirai sisters were defeated in a tag team match by Hikaru Shida and Syuri. Triple Tails' second event took place on May 8 and saw Mio, Io and Kana defeat Akino, Kagetsu and Syuri in a main event six-woman tag team match. In June, Mio began wrestling regularly for Union Pro Wrestling, starting a feud with male wrestler Ken Ohka. On July 10, Shirai defeated Ohka to win the SGP Global Junior Heavyweight Championship, afterwards declaring herself Ohka's master. On July 23, Triple Tails held a press conference to announce that, following the group's third self-produced event on September 18, Io was leaving the stable in order to pursue a singles career. On August 21, Triple Tails made its debut for Oz Academy, defeating the trio of Ayumi Kurihara, Hiren and Yumi Ohka. On September 14, Triple Tails defeated Cherry, Moeka Haruhi and Shuu Shibutani in the group's final Pro Wrestling Wave appearance. Four days later, Triple Tails defeated Dash Chisako, Ryo Mizunami and Sendai Sachiko at their third self-produced event in the group's final appearance together. =Triple Tails.S (2011‚Äì2013)= After Io's departure from Triple Tails, Mio and Kana renamed the group Triple Tails.S and continued wrestling together as a tag team. However, in Smash, Mio and Kana were broken apart following Io's departure, with Kana being preoccupied with the Smash Diva Championship and Mio entering a storyline with Takuya Kito. The storyline involved Kito repeatedly professing his love for Mio, who refused to return the affection. On September 8 at Smash.21, Shirai defeated Kito in a hardcore match. After the match, when Kito continued to profess his love for Shirai, he was attacked by IWA Japan wrestler Keizo Matsuda. During the following months, Shirai repeatedly cost Kito matches against Matsuda and his colleagues, but still could not get him to leave her alone. After the break up of Triple Tails, Shirai continued making semi-regular appearances for Osaka Pro Wrestling, forming a partnership with male wrestler Hayata, whom she would refer to as her \\"big brother\\". The two also went on to team together in Pro Wrestling Wave. On October 19, Shirai lost the SGP Global Junior Heavyweight Championship to Cherry. Initially, Shirai announced that she was leaving Union Pro following her loss, but eventually came back to form a partnership with Ken Ohka, who had now accepted his role as her inferior. Meanwhile, Shirai and Kana also continued to produce their own events; Triple Tails.S' first show took place on November 2 and saw Shirai wrestle Toshie Uematsu to a 30-minute time limit draw in the main event. On November 23, Shirai and Kana defeated Ayako Hamada and Shuu Shibutani in the finals to win the Osaka Joshi Pro Wrestling Tag Team Tournament. In December 2011, Shirai made her American debut, when she took part in Chikara's JoshiMania weekend. On December 2 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Shirai teamed with Mayumi Ozaki in a losing effort against the team of Ayako Hamada and Cherry. The following day in Everett, Massachusetts, Shirai was defeated by Ozaki in a singles match. On the third and final night of the tour in Manhattan, New York, Shirai, Aja Kong and Tsubasa Kuragaki defeated Hanako Nakamori, Manami Toyota and Sawako Shimono in a six-woman tag team match. On January 3, 2012, Shirai returned to the ring with her sister, when she teamed with Ken Ohka at a Union Pro event to unsuccessfully challenge Io and Nosawa Rongai for the Americas World Mixed Tag Team Championship. At a Pro Wrestling Wave event on February 1, Ayumi Kurihara, Mika Iida and Shuu Shibutani joined forces with Shirai and Kana, turning Triple Tails.S from a tag team once again into a stable. The following month, the stable was renamed White Tails, in reference to Wave's top villainous alliance, Black Dahlia. On February 11, Shirai began working regularly for Oz Academy, defeating Hiroyo Matsumoto, a member of the villainous Seikigun, in her return match to the promotion. On February 26, Shirai was defeated by Seikigun leader Mayumi Ozaki in a tryout match and afterwards agreed to join her stable, noting that they \\"had a lot of things in common\\". Back in Smash, the hostilities between Shirai and Takuya Kito ended after Kito led a four-man team to a final victory over a team of IWA Japan wrestlers, which led to Shirai and Kito teaming together and defeating Aki Shizuku and Koji Doi on March 14 at Smash.Final, the promotion's final event before ceasing its operations. Afterwards, Shirai continued working for Smash's follow-up promotion, Wrestling New Classic, teaming with Kana to defeat Makoto and Syuri at the promotion's first event, Before the Dawn, on April 26. After the match, Shirai sided with Makoto and against Kana, when she was verbally assaulting her defeated opponent. Taking Makoto under her wing, Shirai began referring to her as her sister. In early 2012, Shirai started a rivalry in Union Pro with Cherry, attempting to reveal her true age, a secret Cherry had managed to keep for her whole career. On March 18, Cherry defeated Shirai in a match, where she would have had to reveal her age, had she been defeated. A rematch, with an added stipulation that Shirai would have to remove all of her makeup if she lost, was scheduled for May 4, however, Shirai was forced to pull out of the match, after suffering a nasal fracture at an Oz Academy event five days earlier. Shirai ended up managing her replacement, Emi Sakura, to a win, after interfering in the match; as a result, Cherry was forced to reveal that she was born May 14, 1974. Shirai, working with a nose protector, returned to the ring on May 29 at a Pro Wrestling Wave event, losing to Syuri in her first round-robin match in the 2012 Catch the Wave tournament. On June 8, in her second match in the tournament, Shirai defeated Ayumi Kurihara, and in doing so also won DDT Pro-Wrestling's Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship. Two days later, Shirai lost the title to Hiroyo Matsumoto in the first round of a tournament to determine the number one contender to the Oz Academy Openweight Championship. On June 22, Shirai returned to WNC, when she teamed with Makoto in a tag team match, where they defeated Kana and Syuri. In early July, Shirai and Kana took part in the 2012 Japan Expo in Paris, France. On July 30, Shirai regained the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship by pinning Gorgeous Matsuno in a four-way tag team match. However, immediately afterwards Shirai was pinned for the title by the special guest referee of the match, Gentaro. On July 27 at a Pro Wrestling Wave event, White Tails and Black Dahlia wrestled to a draw in a five-on-five gauntlet match, from which Shirai was eliminated after wrestling Black Dahlia leader Misaki Ohata to a ten-minute time limit draw. Afterwards, Shirai agreed to join Black Dahlia at the request of Ohata, who was trying to bring down the average age of her group, but also wanted to remain a member of White Tails. The two groups then agreed that the stable which would manage to draw fewer people to their self-produced Wave event, which would take place August 7 and 8, would disband. Shirai performed on both the Black Dahlia and the White Tails event and afterwards remained with White Tails, which won the battle for attendance 201-191, forcing Black Dahlia to disband. Also in August, Shirai returned to Ice Ribbon. After remaining undefeated for the entire month, scoring singles victories over Riho and Hamuko Hoshi and a tag team victory over Hikaru Shida, Shirai was named the number one contender to Shida's ICE√ó60 Championship, Ice Ribbon's top title. On September 23 at Ribbon no Kishitachi 2012, Shirai defeated Shida to win the ICE√ó60 Championship, her first major joshi title. Following her win, Shirai turned down Miyako Matsumoto's challenge for the title and stated that she instead wanted to defend it against Tsukasa Fujimoto, whom she dubbed \\"the face of Ice Ribbon\\". On October 28 at 2012 Yokohama Ribbon III, Shirai defeated Fujimoto for her first successful defense of the ICE√ó60 Championship. On November 27, Shirai once again worked under her masked Kaguya persona, when she took part in the 2012 Reina de Reinas tournament, co-produced by Pro Wrestling Wave and AAA in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. After defeating Faby Apache in her opening match, Kaguya was defeated in the finals of the tournament by the reigning AAA Reina de Reinas Champion, Sexy Star. The following day, Shirai made her second successful defense of the ICE√ó60 Championship against Neko Nitta. After several months of inactivity, Shirai and Kana announced on December 5, a week following Kana's departure from WNC, that they were restarting Triple Tails.S. The team's return match took place on December 16 at a Pro Wrestling Wave event, where they were defeated by Hikaru Shida and Yumi Ohka. Also in December, Shirai was in the running for Tokyo Sports' Joshi Puroresu Grand Prize, awarded to the joshi wrestler of the year, but was ultimately defeated in the voting process by Yuzuki Aikawa. On December 31 at RibbonMania 2012, Shirai lost the ICE√ó60 Championship to Maki Narumiya in her third defense, ending her reign at 99 days. On January 13, 2013, Shirai received her first shot at the Oz Academy Openweight Championship in a match, where she was defeated by the defending champion, fellow Seikigun member Chikayo Nagashima. On January 30, Shirai entered a tournament contested for the vacant Triangle Ribbon Championship, defeating Aoi Kizuki and Hikaru Shida in her first round three-way match. On February 11, Shirai was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Miyako Matsumoto in a three-way match, which also included Tsukasa Fujimoto. On February 13, Shirai and Ken Ohka entered a storyline in Union Pro, where the two were forced out of the promotion, after Ohka was defeated by Keisuke Ishii in a \\"Loser Leaves Union match\\". However, the two reappeared at the end of event, now working under balaclavas and the ring names \\"Nazo Fukumen A\\" and \\"Nazo Fukumen B\\" in order to be able to continue working for the promotion. Shirai and Ohka were later joined by several other Union Pro wrestlers under Nazo Fukumen masks, including Shota as Nazo Fukumen C, Gabai-Ji-chan as Nazo Fukumen G, Kengo Mashimo as Nazo Fukumen K, Seiya Morohashi as Nazo Fukumen M, and Hiroshi Fukuda as Nazo Fukumen P. On February 17, Shirai entered the Wave Single Championship tournament as a late replacement for an injured Ayumi Kurihara, but was eliminated in her semifinal match by Kana. On February 24, Triple Tails.S held its first self-produced event in nine months, which saw Shirai and Kana wrestle Arisa Nakajima and Ayako Hamada in a main event tag team match. On March 29, Shirai, along with Hiroshi Fukuda, was named the official commentator for Union Pro's internet broadcasts. On April 5, Shirai made her in-ring debut as Nazo Fukumen B, unsuccessfully challenging Kaori Yoneyama for the Union Fly to Everywhere (FTE) World Championship, despite outside interference from Nazo Fukumen A and Nazo Fukumen P. On April 21, Shirai and Kana defeated Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto to win the Wave Tag Team Championship, bringing Triple Tails.S its first title. On June 9, Shirai picked up a major win by pinning the reigning JWP Openweight Champion Arisa Nakajima during the 2013 Catch the Wave tournament. Despite the win, Shirai failed to advance from her round-robin block, finishing with a record of three wins and three losses. On July 7, Shirai and Kana made their first successful defense of the Wave Tag Team Championship against Kyusei Sakura Hirota and Tsukasa Fujimoto. On July 12, the White Tails stable produced their final event before the group's dissolution, during which Shirai defeated the soon-to-retire Ayumi Kurihara in a singles match. Three days later, Shirai and Kana lost the Wave Tag Team Championship to Shidarezakura (Hikaru Shida and Yumi Ohka) in their second defense. On July 27, Shirai made another appearance as Kaguya for Pro Wrestling Wave, when she took part in a match, where Ayumi Kurihara retired her masked A‚òÜYU‚òÜMI persona. Replacing an injured Ray, she teamed with Leon to defeat A‚òÜYU‚òÜMI and noki-A, the masked Akino, in a tag team main event. Back in Ice Ribbon, Shirai formed a new partnership with rookie Rutsuko Yamaguchi. On August 25, Shirai and Yamaguchi defeated BBA38 (Cherry and Meari Naito) to become the number one contenders to the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. They received their title shot on September 22, but were defeated by the defending champions, Muscle Venus (Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto). The following day in Union Pro, the Nazo Fukumen storyline was concluded, when first Kaori Yoneyama unmasked Nazo Fukumen B as Shirai during a mixed tag team match and later in the main event, Nazo Fukumen K, KJ and P lost to Union Seikigun (Isami Kodaka, Madoka and Seiya Morohashi) in a three- on-three hardcore elimination match. Post-match, the now unmasked Hiroshi Fukuda apologized for the stable's past actions and both he and Shirai were welcomed back to Union Pro by the promotion's official representative Naomi Susan. Shirai then entered a storyline built on the relationship between Union Pro and AV company IdeaPocket. Picking up wins over the likes of Hiroshi Fukuda, Masayuki Mitomi and MensoÔΩûre Oyaji, Shirai earned the right to collaborate with AV actresses such as Rika Seibi, Ryu Mizusaki and Tsubasa Amami. On October 20, Shirai returned to AJPW, when the promotion held its first women's match in years, where she was defeated by Akino. Six days later, Shirai made her debut for the AJPW splinter promotion Wrestle-1, defeating Bambi in a singles match. In late 2013, Shirai formed a new cross-promotional three-woman stable named Kuros with Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto. After not appearing for the promotion for thirteen months, it was announced on October 31 that Shirai would be returning to Wrestling New Classic as the newest member of Makoto's Shiritsu Puroresu Gakuen (\\"Private Wrestling School\\") stable. Shirai, however, quickly established that she was not on the same page as Makoto, announcing that she was bringing Misaki Ohata with her to confront the \\"wimps\\" in charge of the school. Shirai's WNC return match took place on November 29, when she and Ohata defeated Makoto and Miyako Matsumoto in a tag team match. On December 27, Shirai and Kana announced they were disbanding Triple Tails.S, with their final self-produced independent event taking place in early 2014. =Four-way affiliation (2014‚Äì2015)= On January 22, 2014, Shirai held a press conference with the heads of Ice Ribbon, Oz Academy, Pro Wrestling Wave and Union Pro to announce that she had signed an unprecedented four-way contract with the promotions and was now officially affiliated with all four of them. As a signing gift, Shirai was given the right to book Oz Academy's March 2 event. She punished Seikigun's rivals Chikayo Nagashima, Hikaru Shida, Kagetsu and Sonoko Kato by placing them in unfavorable matches, named stablemates Mayumi Ozaki and Yumi Ohka the number one contenders to the Oz Academy Tag Team Championship and gave herself a shot at the Oz Academy Openweight Championship. Meanwhile, Shirai also earned another shot at the Union FTE World Championship, challenging Cherry after her first match under a Union Pro contract on February 11, where the two defeated Kaori Yoneyama and Sareee. On March 2, Shirai failed in her attempt to capture the Oz Academy Openweight Championship from Akino. Shirai also failed to win gold on two occasions in another one of her new home promotions, Ice Ribbon, unsuccessfully challenging Cherry for the Triangle Ribbon Championship on March 1 and Muscle Venus for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship alongside Miyako Matsumoto on March 9. On March 23, Shirai also failed to win the Union FTE World Championship from Cherry.

On September 15, Shirai and Misaki Ohata unsuccessfully challenged Sakuragohan (Mika Iida and Kyusei Sakura Hirota) for the Wave Tag Team Championship, which also forced them to start the upcoming 2014 Dual Shock Wave from the first round. On September 23, Shirai and Ohata defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto and Yumi Ohka in the first round of the tournament. On October 1, Shirai and Ohata defeated Dynamite Kansai and Fairy Nipponbashi to advance to the semifinals of the tournament, where, later that same event, they wrestled Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Ohata was then defeated by Kimura in an overtime singles match and, as a result, both she and Shirai were eliminated from the tournament. On November 26, Kuros won Wave's second annual One Day 6-Person Tag Tournament, defeating Cherry, Meari Naito and Shuu Shibutani in the finals and, as a result, earned the right to produce the December 14 Wave event.

Later that same day, Shirai faced Oz Academy Tag Team Champion and MK4 member Kaho Kobayashi in a non-title match at an event co-produced by Oz Academy and Pro Wrestling Wave. Following outside interference from Tomoka Nakagawa, Shirai was pinned by Kobayashi and, as a result, relinquished the Oz Academy Openweight Championship, ending her reign at only four hours and two minutes.

Kunz played as a forward in a playing career that included spells at domestic clubs such as BSC Young Boys, FC Sion and FC Aarau, as well as two seasons at German side SV Werder Bremen. Playing career =Club career= Kunz started his career with Neuch√¢tel Xamax in the 1987‚Äì88 season. He made nine appearances in his first season as Xamax finished as league champions of the Nationalliga A, the country's top division. The following season, Kunz played five league games for Xamax and also made his debut in Europe, coming on as a late substitute for Philippe Perret in Xamax's 5‚Äì0 second-leg defeat to Turkish giants Galatasaray on 9 November 1988 in the second round of the competition, a defeat that meant Xamax were eliminated on aggregate. Kunz left for FC Bulle of the Nationalliga B midway through the season, and scored five times in thirteen games for his new club, with Bulle finishing fifth in the league. The 1989‚Äì90 season saw greater success for both player and club; Bulle finished as runners-up of the Nationalliga B West but ended up missing out on promotion by five points, while Kunz scored 15 goals in 32 league appearances, making him the joint-third top scorer in Bulle's promotion group. Kunz also netted 15 times in the following season, but did so in three fewer league games as Bulle slipped to eighth in the Nationalliga B, narrowly avoiding relegation to the third tier. Scoring six times in just ten games, Kunz was the second-top scorer in Bulle's relegation group, beaten only by teammate Andre Magnin. With Bulle in decline, Kunz joined top-flight side BSC Young Boys ahead of the 1991‚Äì92 campaign. Ironically, Kunz found playing time easier to come by at his new, more successful club, playing all but three of 36 league games as the club finished in fourth place. The forward also scored twelve league goals ‚Äì almost a quarter of Young Boys' collective tally for the season. Although Young Boys enjoyed more success in the 1992‚Äì93 season, finishing as league runners-up, Kunz only managed to score six goals in 32 appearances. However, Kunz recovered to score 13 league goals for the club in the 1993‚Äì94 campaign, ending the season as the Swiss top-flight's joint-fifth top-scorer and recording the league's joint-third highest assist count in the first stage of the season. With Young Boys slipping to a disappointing sixth- placed finish, Kunz transferred to third-placed FC Sion in time for the 1994‚Äì95 season. He played for Werder Bremen between 1997 and 1999, winning the 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

Tolkien's The Hobbit. The character does not appear in the original book, but was created by Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh as an expansion of material adapted from the book. She first appears in the second and third films in that trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. She is a Woodland Elf whose name has been translated as \\"Daughter of the forest\\", and is the head of the Mirkwood Elven guard. She is played by Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly, who was nominated for several awards for her performance in The Desolation of Smaug, with some of the stunt work performed by Australian stuntwoman Ingrid Kleinig. Appearances The character of Tauriel was created for the films, having no equivalent character in the original novel. She first appears in the second film of the trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug, released December 13, 2013.Rottenberg, Josh (June 5, 2013). \\"First look: Evangeline Lilly's elf warrior in 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' -- EXCLUSIVE\\". Entertainment Weekly. Prior to the decision to have three films instead of two, Tauriel was described as having a more substantial role in what was then the final film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which had been planned for release in 2013, but was finalized as the third part of the trilogy, which was released in December 2014. In The Desolation of Smaug, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, and thirteen dwarves, while traveling to Lonely Mountain, pass through the black forest of Mirkwood, where they are attacked and captured by giant spiders. The spiders are then attacked by the Wood Elves, led by Legolas and Tauriel. Tauriel in particular saves K√≠li by killing two spiders that attacked him, but the Elves subsequently take the dwarves as prisoners for trespassing on their land. It is later mentioned that Tauriel is a talented warrior and was therefore made leader of the Mirkwood border guards. Legolas, the son of Mirkwood's Elven king Thranduil, is indicated to be attracted to her, but as she is a lowly Silvan Elf, she does not believe herself worthy of him. Thranduil, in fact, makes it clear that he does not consider her to be a suitable match for his son and warns her not to give Legolas false hope. During the dwarves' imprisonment, Tauriel forms a romantic bond with K√≠li. When the dwarves escape with Bilbo's help, the pursuing Elves are attacked by orcs, during which Tauriel again uses her fighting skills to save K√≠li, though K√≠li is struck in the leg with an orc's arrow, which Tauriel later learns from a captured orc is a Morgul-cursed weapon that will slowly kill him. Just before Thranduil seals off his kingdom upon learning that an evil entity has returned and is amassing great power in the south, Tauriel goes after the dwarves. Legolas follows, and initially tries to convince her to return, but when Tauriel refuses, saying that the Elves are part of Middle-earth and will be drawn into this inevitable war, Legolas joins her pursuit. After acquiring provisions at Esgaroth, the dwarves leave for the Lonely Mountain. K√≠li, Fili, Bofur and √ìin stay behind, with K√≠li suffering from the effects of the poison. By the time Tauriel and Legolas reach Esgaroth, the dwarves are being attacked by orcs. They repel the invaders, and Tauriel uses her knowledge of herbs and elvish medicine to heal K√≠li's wound, saving his life once again. In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, during Smaug's attack on Esgaroth, Tauriel and the dwarves facilitate the evacuation of Bard's family, though Bain leaves their company and helps Bard kill Smaug. The following morning, as the dwarves set out for Erebor to rejoin their company, K√≠li asks Tauriel to come with them, but her duties with Legolas forces them to part. When a messenger from Thranduil arrives to announce her banishment from the Mirkwood Realm for disobeying his orders, she joins Legolas in investigating the old fortress Gundabad, where they witness the departure of an army led by Bolg to join the forces of his father Azog marching against Erebor. Hurrying towards the mountain, the two Elves arrive in the thick of the Battle of the Five Armies. When Tauriel witnesses Thranduil attempting to leave the battlefield, with the intent of sparing his people further bloodshed, she confronts him with her bow and a nocked arrow, refusing to abandon K√≠li to death. Thranduil, dismissing the depth of her feelings for K√≠li, destroys her bow, though he spares her life despite her defiance. Learning that K√≠li had joined Thorin's pursuit of Azog, she and Legolas hurry to Azog's command post, the Ravenhill, to aid the dwarves. Running to find K√≠li, Tauriel is intercepted and brought to her knees by Bolg. Before the Orc can strike the fatal blow, however, K√≠li intervenes on her behalf, and Bolg kills him instead. In retaliation, Tauriel tackles Bolg, throwing him and herself off a ruined platform onto the rocks beneath, thus leading to Bolg's final battle with Legolas, who kills Bolg. Following the resolution of the battle, Thranduil finds Tauriel weeping over K√≠li's body, finally acknowledging that her feelings for the young dwarf were genuine. Conception and casting In 1937 J. R. R. Tolkien published the fantasy novel The Hobbit, whose plot centres on a group consisting of the titular Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard and thirteen dwarves, who go in search of a treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug. During the course of their travels, they enter the black forest of Mirkwood, where they find themselves in the dungeons of the Silvan Elves. During the climactic Battle of Five Armies at the end of the story, the dwarves, men and elves band together to fight an army of goblins and Wargs.Chuck Dixon and David Wenzel. The Hobbit. 1989. Ballantine Publishing Group. Based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien. 1937. Actress Evangeline Lilly, who plays Tauriel, had been a fan of Tolkien since she was 13. Although the character Tauriel does not appear in this story, she was created to be the head of the Elven guard by Peter Jackson and his writing partners Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh, (who is also Jackson's wife and producing partner) in order to expand the world of the elves of Mirkwood Forest, and to bring another woman to the cast, which is otherwise dominated by men.\\"Full transcript of Comic-Con Hobbit Panel Q&A;!\\". TheOneRing.net. July 16, 2012. The character Tauriel is a Silvan Elf, which means she is of a much lower order than the elves that had previously been seen in The Lord of the Rings film series, and holds a lower social status than characters like Arwen, Galadriel, Elrond, and Legolas. A Woodland Elf, her name has been translated as \\"Forest Daughter.\\"\\"Evangeline Lilly Reveals Her Fears About Her 'Hobbit' Character\\". Access Hollywood.

Today. June 20, 2011. Lilly, who had been a fan of Tolkien's books since she was 13, expressed some trepidation at the reaction of Tolkien purists to a character that does not appear in Tolkien's written works, but stated that creating the character for the adaptation was justified: \\"I believe she is authentic, because Tolkien refers to The Woodland Elves, he just doesn't talk about who they are specifically‚Ä¶ [Peter and Fran] know that world so well. They‚Äôre not going to create a character that is not true to Tolkien's world.\\" Nonetheless, following the June 12, 2013 release of the first trailer for the film, some fans expressed dissatisfaction with the creation of a character that did not originate in the source material. As head of the Elven guard, Lilly says of Tauriel, \\"She's slightly reckless and totally ruthless and doesn't hesitate to kill.\\" Lilly also describes Tauriel as a nonconformist, explaining that as a result of her relative youth among Elves, she is brash and impulsive,Davis, Lauren (October 17, 2013). \\"How Desolation of Smaug adds Elves who don't appear in The Hobbit\\". io9. tending to rebel against the established social order of the Elves. Lilly explains, \\"She's only 600 years old, she's just a baby. So she's a bit more impulsive, and she's a bit more immature. I think she's more easily romanticized by a lot of things.\\" Alluding to Tauriel's pursuit of the dwarves in The Desolation of Smaug after Thranduil closes his kingdom's borders and forbids any interference on the part of Elves in outside affairs, and her refusal to fight alongside him in The Battle of the Five Armies, Lilly explains, \\"In a very out of character move for an elf, she's broken ranks and disobeyed authority. That's driven from her own conviction about what is right and what is wrong. She feels so much at odds with Thranduil, that she feels the need to defy him. I think that any defiant role that boxes authority is an easy fit for me, because in life I'm a little bit like that.\\"Jordan, Richard (December 2014). \\"Battlefield Middle-earth\\", Total Film. p 67 However, Tauriel also has a \\"softer side\\", and her character arc includes a love story. Though she and Legolas first met as children, and their relationship is significant, her romantic arc is not with him, as she develops a mutual attraction to the dwarf K√≠li. Legolas' father, the Elven king Thranduil, is fond of Tauriel, and \\"sees something very special in her\\", though she understands that Thranduil would not approve of her pairing with his son, which Thranduil confirms in The Desolation of Smaug when he tells her not to give Legolas false hope of such a relationship. Lilly accepted the role under the condition that her role in The Hobbit would not include a love triangle. When she was called back into production for reshoots following the decision to split the story into three films instead of two, she was told that such a plot device would indeed be added to the story.Harp, Justin (December 18, 2013). \\"Evangeline Lilly on The Hobbit films: 'I didn't want a love triangle'\\". Digital Spy.Paur, Joey (January 2014). Evangeline Lilly Didn't Want a Love Triangle in The Hobbit\\". Geek Tyrant. Retrieved December 27, 2013. Filming of Tauriel's scenes began in September 2011 in New Zealand, and was expected to last a year. Lilly stated that she enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the set, and the familiar experience of filming with a male-dominated cast, which was reminiscent of her work on Lost and The Hurt Locker.Warner, Kara (October 3, 2011). \\"'Hobbit' Is Yet Another 'Boys Club' For Evangeline Lilly\\". MTV Movie News. Lilly employed a language coach in order to effect the Elvish language. In addition to the red wig she wore to effect Tauriel's knee-length red hair, Lilly, when given a choice of wearing small, medium or large prosthetic ears, chose the large ones, which are three times the size of the prosthetics Orlando Bloom wore as Legolas, though Lilly believed that the length of her hair would distract attention from the ears. In terms of costuming, unlike previous female Elves who were noblewomen that wore complex formal gowns, Tauriel is a border guard and soldier, and therefore wears more pragmatic Elven military garb. The character is proficient in a variety of weapons, but mainly wields a bow and two daggers, weapons that are also used by the character Legolas, who also appears with her in The Hobbit films. Lilly employed a stunt coach for action scenes. She noted that the experience of having had her first child in May 2011 made aspects of filming the fighting scenes more strenuous than expected, commenting, \\"Recovering from labor is like recovering from a full-body injury, and I didn't realize to what extent that was true until I started training for elf fighting. My hips don't move like they used to move, my back doesn't move like it used to move, my shoulders are sore every day. But it's fun.\\" Although Lilly requested to do the character's wirework herself, on account of her experience doing her own stunts on Lost, that work was performed by Lilly's stunt double, Australian stuntwoman Ingrid Kleinig.Curtis, Larry D.

Merchandising Tauriel is part of Lego set No. 79001 titled Escape from Mirkwood Spiders, together with minifigures of Legolas and the Dwarves F√≠li and K√≠li, and set No. 79016 titled Attack on Lake-Town, with minifigures of Bard, Bain, and 2 Hunter Orcs. Reception and cultural impact For her performance as Tauriel, Evangeline Lilly was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the 2014 Kids' Choice Awards. In an article written in The Huffington Post, Clarence Haynes compared Tauriel to Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, describing both of them as archetypical embodiments of the ancient Greek goddess Artemis. Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post, in his review of The Desolation of Smaug, welcomed Tauriel's addition to the set of characters and called her \\"a sort of pointy-eared Lara Croft\\". Shaun Gunner, Chairman of the Tolkien Society, praised the inclusion of Tauriel as \\"the biggest gem and missed opportunity of this film\\" stating that she provides \\"a strong and warm voice in the story\\" but that the writers \\"were wrong to cheapen the character by putting her in a love-triangle\\". Fan reaction to Tauriel's appearance in The Hobbit films, and to other changes made by Jackson in adapting Tolkien's book for the screen, were parodied in the song and video \\"Who the 'ell is Tauriel?\\" by The Esgaroth Three.McAlpine, Fraser (January 2, 2014). \\"A Must-Watch For 'Hobbit' Fans: 'Who The ‚ÄòEll Is Tauriel?'\\".

In Mad magazine's parody of The Desolation of Smaug, writer Desmond Devlin emphasized the similarity of the setting in which actress Evangeline Lilly's character was placed with that of her character on Lost, with her statement, \\"I can't believe I'm back in another weird forest, fighting random threats and making random alliances on a vague and poorly-defined mission. I thought I was done with that stuff when they cancelled Lost!\\" Devlin, who had begun a running joke of alluding to Legolas (called Legolamb in the parody) being effeminate in the magazine's parodies of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, also used Tauriel to return to that gag, as well as referencing Tauriel's lack of canonicity.

The organization fiercely protects its list of members for whom it maintains a secure private website, abespal.com. Sinise later withdrew from the leadership and Hollywood producer Jeremy Boreing became executive director. The group met monthly to hear guest speakers. It has hosted a number of Republican politicians at its events, including Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum, John Boehner, and Thaddeus McCotter. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia received reimbursement for giving a speech at a FOA fundraiser in 2012. Glenn Beck, Ann Coulter, Michael Steele and Mark Levin have also met with Friends of Abe, as have political operatives Frank Luntz and Karl Rove. Friends of Abe spent three years trying to get tax- exempt 501(c)(3) status for their organization. The tax status is reserved for organizations that do not engage in any partisan activity. IRS officials have questioned whether the organization's promotion of presidential candidates during its events constituted political campaign support, an activity forbidden for tax-exempt organizations. During the application process, FOA refused IRS demands to provide it with access to the part of its website that includes its list of members since such access is not required by federal law. The tax-exempt status was granted in March 2014. Dole CEO David H. Murdock has hosted FOA's annual gatherings at his 1,300-acre estate, Ventura Farms. In April 2016 it was announced by executive director Boreing that ‚ÄúEffective immediately, we are going to begin to wind down the 501 c3 organization, bring the Sustaining Membership dues to an end, and do away with the costly infrastructure and the abespal.com website‚Äù A rival group with the same name was founded in 2017, partly due to conservative divisions over Donald Trump.

General effects  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics report that suicide rates in the United States are lowest during the winter months and highest in the spring and summer. Stephen Bridges asserts that there is \\"a high incidence in early spring (April and May) and also a low incidence in winter\\" of suicide rates. Bridges's study focused on seasonal effects on suicide risk by examining the monthly distribution of suicides in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s via a \\"harmonic time series model\\" with six observable harmonic cycles within each consecutive year. The results show a consistent pattern of suicide risk with most suicides occurring in the spring/summer and the fewest during the winter months. Specifically, Bridges found that in the 1970s \\"about 47% of the total variances can be explained by the seasonal components\\" within that given decade (with more suicides in spring/summer). In the 1980s, \\"the seasonal component of suicide incidence for the time period 1981 through 1990 is clearly significant and records about a 27.7% increase in seasonal contribution by comparison with the previous period\\". In the 1990s, \\"the significant seasonal rhythm were explained in 63% of the total variation\\". According to Bridges, recent research from industrialized countries (including Finland, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, England, and Wales) has provided enough information to show a decrease in seasonal effects on suicide rates over the past few decades. In the case of Greece, seasonal variations in mortality from suicide are \\"more frequent during the spring and summer months‚Ä¶but [have] no regular annual rhythm\\". The Greek researchers proposed that \\"the seasonal variation of suicide follows more closely to the seasonal variation of sunshine, rather than the corresponding variation of temperature\\". Few scientific assessments have focused on seasonal suicide Epidemiology of suicide variations in the southern hemisphere. Studies in Brazil have shown that \\"the peak number of suicides occurred in spring (November) in men and women of Rio Grande do Sul state and in men of Paran√° and Santa Catarina states, and in early summer (January) for women of Paran√° state.\\" One international study on seasonal effects on suicide rates involving 20 countries showed an early summer peak in suicides. She concluded that \\"seasonal variation in suicide incidence could be explained by the increase in sunshine in summer months because of a relationship between sunshine, high temperatures, and suicide rate\\". Australian researchers found a \\"spring peak in the number of suicides committed in Brisbane, Australia, but the results were not statistically significant‚Ä¶and that Dublin reported the incidence of suicide varied according to seasons in the northern hemisphere\\". French sociologist √âmile Durkheim had found similar results, reporting that more suicides occurred in the spring than in the summer. Rather than emphasizing the role of nature, Durkheim interpreted the seasonal variation in sociological terms; he wrote that most suicides took place in the spring because \\"everything begins to awake; activity is resumed, relations spring up, interchanges increase. In other words, it is the density of human interactions, and not the environment that caused higher incidence of suicide in spring or summer\\".  Popular belief  Many people believe that suicide rates peak during the winter months. Intuitively, this makes sense given the existence of seasonal affective disorder and the tendency to associate winter with depression.http://depression.about.com/cs/sad/a/sad.htm Weather in the colder season increases the prevalence of afflictions such as pneumonia and hypothermia, which largely proceeds from the minimal amount of sunlight exposure in the wintertime. As winter is popularly associated with a decrease in sunlight and an uptick in distempers, so it is by extension with suicide rates. Some also believe that \\"holiday cheer amplifies loneliness and hopelessness in people who have lost loved ones, or who have high expectations of renewed happiness during the holiday season, only to be disappointed\\".Jacquelyn Rudis, True or False: Depression and Suicide Rates Rise During the Holiday Season, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, accessed April 12, 2012  Related factors  Suicide attempts as well as other related behaviors and thought processes can be analyzed either exogenously (within the boundaries of social and economic elements) or endogenously (demographic, pathological, clinical, and seasonal aspects). =Gender= As noted in a study led by Timo Partonen and colleagues, \\"There was a seasonal effect on suicide occurrence among the study population in Finland, and the risk of suicide was highest in May and lowest in February over the study period\\"‚Ä¶males with an incidence of 42.56 (N=21,622) and females with an incidence of 10.86 (N=5847).Partonen, T.; Haukka, J.; Nevanlinna, H.; et al. (2004). Analysis of the seasonal pattern in suicide. Journal of Affective Disorders, 81, 133‚Äì139. Their findings demonstrate that both male and female suicide rates tend to be higher during the spring and summer months (combined gender inference of: April ~ 27.24; May ~ 30.04; June ~ 28.86; July ~ 27.83) compared to winter (Nov. ~ 25.77; Dec. ~ 23.17; Jan. ~ 24.07; Feb. ~ 23.16). Similar results were reported in Lester and Franks‚Äô article \\"Sex differences in the seasonal distribution of suicides\\". These researchers focused on the influence of climate and social integration, in regards to suicide rates categorized by gender. Their data suggest that both genders showed a \\"bimodal distribution of suicides and the sexes, but did not differ significantly from each other (x@=l2.29, d.f.=ll, P>0.30)\\". The authors hypothesized that the high summer peaks in suicide deaths are the result of an ultimately disappointed hope amongst the emotionally discomforted that winter might bring an end to the \\"social isolation and depression brought about by the cold weather\\". In contrast to these findings, some studies indicate that males have only one peak of suicide during the spring and early summer while women show two peaks of suicide throughout the year, during the spring and fall: \\"The seasonal distribution of suicides among the 117 males was similar and showed a significant seasonality: spring and summer peaks (33 and 29%, respectively) and fall‚Äìwinter lows (18% and 20%, respectively, œá2=7.684, d.f.=3, P=0.053)\\". =Biochemistry= Biological explanations of seasonal effects on suicide rates tend to focus on seasonal variation in hormone changes and neurotransmitter levels. Chronobiological research, conducted by a team of clinical scientists in Belgium, has revealed that many \\"biochemical, metabolic and immune functions, which may be related to suicide, suicidal behavior or ideation or major depression, are organized along a multifrequency seasonal time-structure\\". Evidence was found by calculating \\"serum total cholesterol concentrations to show a clear seasonality with lower levels in midyear than in winter\\" Similarly, medical researchers in Pennsylvania indicate that neuropeptides in normal controls have lower serum cholesterol levels and may be related to a higher occurrence of suicide. These findings clearly state that there is a relationship between summer suicide rates and biochemical (e.g., plasma L-TRP and melatonin levels, [3H]paroxetine binding to blood platelets), metabolic (serum total cholesterol, calcium and magnesium concentrations), and immune (number of peripheral blood lymphocytes and serum sIL-2R) variables. Another study focused on the association between depression, suicide, and the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). They state that \\"depression is accompanied by a depletion of n-3 poly- unsaturated fatty acids\\". Their methodology involved taking periodic blood samples‚Äîevery month for one year‚Äîof healthy volunteers, allowing them to analyze the \\"PUFA composition in serum phospholipids and [relating] those data to the annual variation in the mean weekly number of suicides\\". They used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to document their results, finding that PUFA like arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid all occurred at significantly lower rates in winter than in summer months. The association between depression, suicide, and PUFA rates is indicative of there being a biological factor in seasonal effects on suicide rates. =Environment= Environmental variables, such as the amount of sunlight, occurrence of natural disasters, and the inability to protect and shelter oneself, can result in suicidal behaviors. For example, parasuicide, which is the strongest known indicator for a future completed suicide attempt, is known to have a strong association with weather patterns. As noted by Barker et al. in their 1994 article on seasonal and weather factors in parasuicide, \\"A major finding of this study was‚Ä¶the greatest mean daily number of parasuicide episodes in late spring/early summer and a trough in December/January\\". Their approach involved developing a linear model to accurately separate any \\"seasonal effects and seasonally-related weather effects\\". Climate factors affect parasuicide differently in women and men. The data indicated that the meteorological factors to account for large parasuicidal effects in women were maximum temperature, rainfall, and cloud cover. On the other hand, rain, cloud cover, poor visibility, and windy days were the most important meteorological factors in men. Additionally, \\"environmental temperature, wind and humidity together affect the rate of body cooling, with hot, humid, still days decreasing evaporative cooling\\". These findings state that elevated levels of environmental heat have been known to \\"produce thermal stress causing physiological and behavioral change, which may predispose a person to parasuicidal behavior, or precipitate parasuicide in someone already considering it\\". Along with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Petridou and colleague showed a \\"consistency of an early summer excess incidence of suicide around the world, and the further association of suicide with hours of sunshine, strongly [suggesting] that a physical environmental factor plays an important role in the triggering of suicide\\" across twenty OECD countries around the world. All but two of the countries on their list (Australia and New Zealand) showed peaks in suicide rates between April and June; Australia and New Zealand, being the only southern-hemisphere countries in the study, peaked in November or December. Petridou notes that \\"it is possible that the excess suicide risk during the summer months could be associated with behavioral changes of the persons not attributed directly to sunshine...so that suicide risk could be affected by factors associated with more free time rather than more sunshine\\". Regarding Australia‚Äôs seasonal rates of suicide, studies have confirmed that the country's suicide peak in December and January is also from the number of \\"bright sunlight hours\\". To shed light on Petridou‚Äôs concern that a confounding variable may be raising suicide rates in the sunny summer months, Quercioli (2012) instead considered a new instrument for changing sunlight alone ‚Äî leaving unaffected other seasonal factors associated to summer. She looked at the three north-south strips of neighboring counties, spanning the three time zone lines. Their only relevant difference is the sunlight around sunset or sunrise. Those living on the West side of a time zone line enjoy one less hour of light at night, compensated by an extra hour of light in the morning. But since most people rise after sunrise but sleep long after sunset, those on the West side enjoy an hour less sunlight daily. Consistent with the hypothesis that sunlight by itself reduces suicide rates, Quercioli (2012) finds that suicide rates in counties on the West side of each of the three time-zone lines in the USA had an 8% higher suicide rate in the years 1979 to 2007. =Psychology= Psychological disorders can be affected by seasonal changes and result in suicide. There is also a \\"physiological strain that results from the low ambient temperatures\\", from which suicidal ideations are considered to stem. Behavioral psychologist Friedrich V. Wenz measured seasonal effects on suicide rates and researched the association between seasonal effects and psychopathology. Wenz \\"investigated the relation of 2 components of loneliness, present and future loneliness, to seasonality of suicide attempts\\". Wenz‚Äôs empirical literature states that suicide attempts from feelings of loneliness were highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter. On the other hand, \\"The mean scale scores for present and future loneliness were greatest for spring and winter, the peak seasons for the timing of suicide attempts... persons may actually postpone acts of attempted suicide in order to participate and become emotionally involved in important annual ceremonies\\". Patients diagnosed with a mood disorder have shown repetitive rates in a seasonal recurrence of suicide. The seasonal mood disorders that were recurrent in this study are as follows: \\"depression, 51%, and bipolar disorder, 49%, with 30% of the latter having mania (bipolar disorder type I) and 19% having hypomania (bipolar disorder type II)\\". When a mood disorder recurs in a seasonal pattern it is described as a seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Pendse, Westrin, and Engstrom‚Äôs research on the effect of temperament on seasonal affective disorder and suicide attempts determined that \\"the suicidal behavior of SAD patients is not a prominent problem, even though SAD patients often present suicidal ideation\\". Pendse and colleagues compared a small sample of patients who suffered from seasonal affective disorder and also hospitalized suicide attempters who had experienced \\"non-seasonal major depression\\" by using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Results state that the SAD control group had a significant probability of scoring higher on non-psychotic tests than the non-SAD suicide attempters‚Äîwhen both groups were analyzed for items such as \\"hostile feelings, indecision (negatively), lassitude, failing memory, increased sleep, muscular tension, loss of sensation or movement, and disrupted thoughts, and the observed items were perplexity, slowness of movement (negatively), and agitation\\".

Under this the council gave 21 years of running powers over Exeter's streets. The rights were assigned to a commercial company, The Exeter Tramway Company. This company was launched in 1881 when its prospectus was published in The Times.The Times, 26 September 1881 The directors were William Leigh Bernard, W. Standing, and WM Wood. The Manager and Inspector was SH Culley and the Secretary was J. Lord.The Stock Exchange Year Book, 1883 The Exeter Tramway Company was formed at a meeting at the Black Horse Inn on Longbrook Street on 15 November 1881. Construction of the tramway began on 3 January 1882 and it started horse-drawn tramway services in Exeter on 6 April 1882. Although the routes along Sidwell Street and Heavitree Road proved to be popular, the company's failure to get permission for a line along Queen Street and High Street in the heart of the town made it difficult for the company to make a large operating surplus. This meant they were unable to expand the system or even keep the trams well maintained. As early as 1883 the company had difficulty in paying its mortgage and other debts. The company continued have financial difficulties and faced liquidation in 1888.Railway times, Volume 54, 1888 The Company was subject to a Compulsory Winding Up Order dated 10 March 1888 and attempts by the Liquidator to find a buyer were unsuccessful. The Company was dissolved by the High Court on 7 August 1889.The National Archives File C 26/218 In 1892 it was taken over by the Tramway Purchase Syndicate and leased to Frederick Burt and Company. However, even under the new ownership, problems were ongoing. In 1893 Sunday services were suspended through the spring, and the route up the steep hill from Exeter St David's into town was abandoned. By the start of the twentieth century, the 21 year life of the act which set up the system was coming to its end and the corporation had a right to purchase the business. In 1903 the Exeter Corporation Bill was passed in Parliament which gave the corporation the right to buy out the Exeter Tramway Company and construct a new system. The company and stock of the tramway was purchased by Exeter Corporation on 1 February 1904 for ¬£6,749. Exeter Corporation Tramways built a new system of electric trams. The last horse-drawn tram ran on 4 April 1905. Going in front of the first electric tram service it travelled from the Guildhall and then along the High Street, down New North Road, to the tram shed and into retirement. =Electric era= From 1882 the Exeter Tramway Company had been operating a horse-drawn tramway service. The authority to run this service had been granted under a 21-year act, and so by 1900 the act was coming up for renewal. Two private companies approached the city council to seek permission to replace the horse trams with electric trams. However, the city council decided to investigate the possibility of running the trams services themselves. Members of the Tramways Committee went to visit other tram systems, including ones in London, Birmingham, Southampton and even going to France to visit systems in Paris, Rouen and Le Havre. The report prepared by the city surveyor and its electrical engineer supported the adoption of an overhead trolley system. In December 1902 a poll of residents was taken on two questions - whether to present a Parliamentary Bill for the right to run the trams and whether the trams should run along the High Street. The first questions was approved with a 79% majority and the second with a majority of 75%. The previous horse tram system had been refused permission to run along the High Street. This was despite opposition from some local business leaders such as Charles Josiah Ross (owner of a local draper and outfitters shop) and other firms such as Hinton Lake the chemists and W.R. Lisle, jewellers. In 1903 a Bill was passed in Parliament for the right to buy out the Exeter Tramways Company and for the city to build and run a new system. The cost of setting up the electric tramways was ¬£65,200. The cost included ¬£6,800 to buy out the previous company and all the track, stock and horses. Construction of the tramways involved considerable disruption to the High Street with the road being dug up and a number of properties being demolished to make way for the trams. This led to St Petrocks Church being on the street frontage (having previously been hidden) and the demolition of its porch. The first test of the new electric trams took place on 24 March 1905 from the new depot at the end of Paris Street. The tram had just set off towards Livery Dole when all its lights went out. Fortunately this was found to simply be a minor problem with the engagement of the trolley arm and The Board of Trade Inspector approved the system. The official opening was on 4 April 1905 at 12.30. Five Trams were lined up outside the Guildhall, including the only horse tram ever to travel down the High Street. The first electric tram was driven by the Mayor who was presented with a silver tram handle. Once the tram had travelled to Livery Dole and back, the Mayor gave a speech from the top deck of the first tram. By June 1905 the trams were already carrying 80,000 passengers per week. Special fares for workers were offered with cheaper fares for early morning and early evening travel. The first services only operated from the Guildhall to Mount Pleasant Inn and from St David's to Livery Dole. By September 1906 however, the route crossing the bridge across the River Exe opened with a line out to Stone Lane in Alphington. There was considerable debate about whether to carrying advertising on the trams. Adverts on tickets was introduced from start but many members of council felt that it was not appropriate for a corporation owned service. It was only in 1920 that advertising was carried routinely on the trams. Although the trams continued to run during World War I, they faced severe difficulties. Almost 80% of the staff were involved with war service of some sort with 60% going to war overseas. Women were employed as conductresses but being a motorman (driver) was still seen as a man's job. Due to lack of trained staff, the trams often did not run the full length of the line, leaving passengers to walk to their destinations. The frequency of the trams was reduced in January 1918 from one every eight minutes to one every nine minutes but the trams were still often late and overcrowded. Maintenance also became an issue both from lack of materials and money to pay for them. This lack of maintenance may have contributed to the only fatal accident that ever occurred on the trams. On 6 March 1917 a tramcar got out of control on Fore Street Hill. It collided with a lorry belonging to the London and South Western Railway. A Mrs. Mary Findlay was killed when the car left the rails and overturned.Crediton Chronicle, Saturday 10 Mar 1917 =Closure= By the late 1920s, traffic in the centre of Exeter was becoming an increasing problem - especially during the summer. The High Street was a major bottleneck as almost all the through traffic had to pass along it. All vehicles coming from Bath or Honiton and going towards Plymouth, Torquay or Okehampton had to go through the centre of town and across the Exe Bridge. Between 1920 and 1930 the number of motor vehicles travelling along the High Street each day increased from 1,314 to 5,901. Although some bypass road were built such as Prince of Wales Road and the Hill Barton bypass to Countess Wear, this did little to solve the problems. Part of the problem was perceived to be due to the trams - especially so, given the narrow streets of parts of Exeter and the large proportion of the system which was single track. The tramways committee first introduced bus services in 1928 to serve areas which the trams did not go to. These motor buses were single deckers; Maudslay, Leyland and Bristols. The Maudslay ML3 no 5 (FJ6154)of this period is now preserved. After testing several different buses they eventually chose AEC Regent and Leyland TD2 double deckers (delivered in 1931). As the councillors could not decide whether to replace the trams completely with buses, they commissioned a report from an independent expert whose report was completed in April 1929. He found that there was a backlog of track renewals and other repairs, that the narrow streets were not suitable for trams and that at an average speed of 6.5 miles per hour (compared to 9.5 mph in London) the trams were slower than in any of 11 other cities. In council elections in November 1929, the Labour Party campaigned on a platform of keeping the trams but their vote declined. In 1930 the council finally decide to replace the trams with double-decker buses. In January 1931 the service along Alphington Road ended and the final trams ran on 19 August 1931. The last every tram was driven by Mr E.C. Perry who as mayor, had driven the first tram. The last tram, car 14, was followed by a double decker bus to usher in the new age. Mr E.C. Perry was presented with a silver-plated control handle and Mr Bradley, Chairman of the Transport Committee was presented the reverse lever which was also silver- plated and inscribed. One of the tramcars (No. 19) survived and was restored on the Seaton Tramway but as a single deck tram. Routes =Horse services= A map of the horse - drawn tram system The system had 3 main routes radiating from just outside the East gate of the city. The first trams in 1882, ran from the Bude Hotel in London Inn Square to a stop on Heavitree Road near St Luke's College and was extended to Livery Dole in May 1893. Two additional routes were introduced in 1893: one ran along New North Road, and then down St David's Hill to the Railway station; th third route went to the end of Mount Pleasant Road via Sidwell Street and Blackboy Road. However, a plan to run trams along Queen Street and High Street then on to Barnfield was prevented by the opposition of shop owners on these streets and also by residents. A planned branch along Queen Street as far the Royal Albert Memorial Museum was never built. The depot was in a shed off New North Road. The company also ran connecting horse-bus services which went to Alphington and Kennford, Pinhoe and Broadclyst, Topsham and to the end of Union Road. There was a flat fare of 1d for a single journey, and 3d for a through journey which via London Inn Square. =Electric services= The network in 1930 The electric trams expanded considerably the routes of the former horse tram. The most significant new route was the one which ran along the High Street, over the River Exe, on the bridge completed in 1905, and then divided into two with one branch which ran along Alphington Road as far as Stone Lane, and a second branch went to the top of Cowick Street. The route down Pinhoe Road now went to Abbey Road and that along Heavitree Road was extended through Heavitree (then outside the city boundary) to Cross Park. The section of the horse tram route along New North Road was not included in the new system. Once completed the system operated three routes: * Cross Park Terrace (Heavitree) to Cowick Street, via Paris Street, High Street and the Exe Bridge. The symbol for this route was a white saltire cross on a red background. * Abbey Road junction with Pinhoe Road to Stone Lane junction with Alphington Road, via Sidwell Street, High Street and the Exe Bridge. The symbol for this route was a green circle on a white background. * Exeter St. David's Station to Pinhoe Road via Hele Road. Some trams terminated at Queen Street. The symbol for this route was a white circle on a green background. =Proposed extensions= Several further extensions were proposed but none of them were ever built. The original agreed plans included the following additional routes: down Eastgate to Southernhay; down Longbrook Street and up to Pennsylvania Road; along Bonhay from Fore Street to St David's station; along Denmark Road from Magdalen Street and one down South Street. To ensure the service remained profitable none of these were built. Later proposal for extensions included extensions of the Heavitee line and an extension from Pinhoe road to Whipton. The later proposal got approval for a loan from the Ministry of Transport but was never built. Tram cars A double-deck electric car The horse trams were built to gauge and the first ones were single deckers. Three trams were purchased from the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works' for the opening in 1882. The trams seated sixteen passengers on the inside with four more on the rear platform. The trams were yellow with chocolate brown lettering. Three more trams were bought 1883, when the complete network was opened and then two more in 1884. Around the mid-1890s, the company bought its first double decker trams, again from the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Work Company. A minimum of 6 of these were purchased along with a final single decker tram in a 'toast- rack' style. When the company was bought out, there were four remaining double decker trams and one single decker. Each tram was pulled by a team of two horses. They would be trained by local farmers, first by pulling carts and then moving on to the trams. After they were no longer able to pull the trams, they would be sold back to the farms for lighter work. There were several convictions of tram drivers for cruelty to the horses. At the end of horse- drawn tram services, there were twenty-two horses owned by the company which were sold off by Exeter Corporation for about ¬£15 each. Over the whole of its existence, Exeter Corporation Tramways bought a total of 37 trams. These were numbered 1-24 (without a number 13) in the first series and 1-4 in the second series. All were open top double deck trams with four wheels. Trams 1-21 were purchased between April 1905 and August 1906 from Dick, Kerr & Co. of Preston. They had two motors and had 42 seats, 20 on the lower and 22 on the upper deck. Nos 22-25, bought in December 1914 were the first purchased from Brush (as were all the later trams) and had two motors and seated 44. After World War I two new cars were purchased (26 and 27). These had seats for 54 passengers. Car 27 was the first to be fitted with an enclosed cab. Nos 28-30 were bought in 1925 and were followed by the last of the first series - no 31-34 in 1926. The last trams were purchased in 1929 (1-4 of the new series) and were initially intended for the planned extension to Whipton. They had two General Electric motors and could seat 53 people. They were delivered only months before the decision was made to bring an end to the tram services. In 1931 these four tramcars were sold to Halifax Corporation for ¬£200 each. They ran there for a further 7 years until finally being withdrawn in November 1938. The livery of the trams was dark green and cream with gold lettering and a dark maroon under carriage. Accidents On 26 September 1885 the worst accident of the horse-tram era occurred when the brakes failed while a tram was going down St David's Hill and it overturned. The horses and four passengers were injured. There was one fatal accident on the system on 17 March 1917 after a tram ran out of control down the steep hill of Fore Street, picking up speed and eventually overturning on Exe Bridge.Exeter Memories page on Local Transport Power supplies Lamp standard from the 1905 bridge which was also a traction pole. Now at Butts Ferry. The power for the trams was provided by the newly municipalised City of Exeter Electricity Company who in 1904 had built a new power station at Haven Banks. The trams had the benefit for the company of providing a load during the daytime. The new power station was coal fired with generators made by British Westinghouse and with cabling installed in stone lined conduits by Siemens Brothers of London. It generated a total power of 1,300 kW AC output which was converted to DC at 500-550 V for the trams. The trams were supplied their power through a trolley system and most of the traction poles had side brackets included the ones which were part of the design of the Exe Bridge built in 1905. Some of the pole were also used for street lighting and it is still possible to see some of the bases of the poles, for example among the railings on Hele Road. The system was split into sections which could be isolated and were powered independently. So that problems could be reported quickly, each of the section pillars which provided the supply also had a telephone to the power station and the depot.

Their partnership was dissolved January 1855 Sanford spelled as \\"Sandford\\" and Duryea was in Adelaide late that month, but the Liverpool Street, Hobart business was still advertising as \\"Duryea and Macdonald\\" in April, when Duryea's Adelaide studio was opened. It was in August, at his new Launceston studio, that McDonald began advertising as \\"Macdonald and Co,\\". The Bourke Street business was taken over by Dr. Thomas A.

Photography business in Adelaide He was soon touting for business (as M. Duryea, presumably to emphasise his French ancestry) at his studio upstairs 68 King William Street, at the corner of Grenfell Street rented from Alexander Hay. He worked in the prosperous country towns Gawler and Burra in December 1855, when the style of the company changed to \\"Duryea Brothers\\", indicating that Sanford was running the business in his brother's absence. He was in the Clare district around 1856, where he photographed John and Rebecca Ross.http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=966&c;=2372 He visited Port Lincoln in August 1857, (assistants perhaps Harvey and Hawson) Sanford left for Fremantle, Western Australia in 1857 Nixon and Duryea 1857‚Äì1859 In 1859 he began supplying photographic materials to other photographers. Soon after, his advertisements described him as a \\"photographist\\" rather than a \\"Daguerrean Artist\\", the Daguerreotype process having been rendered largely obsolete by the collodiotype, ambrotype and albumen print. The partnership with Sanford was dissolved 1863 He introduced the Sennotype process, for producing superior tinted photographs, to South Australia. =Selected Works= The achievement for which Duryea is best remembered is his Panorama of December 1865. Taken from the \\"Albert Tower\\" of the Town Hall, it is composed of 14 photographs which Townsend made in the course of one day. In 1866 he commenced another speciality ‚Äì vignette cartes de visite. One of the first to order was Commodore Sir William and Lady Wiseman. A notable production, a group photograph of the staff of Harris, Scarfe Limited was presented to the founder, George P Harris, on his departure for England in 1867. Townsend Duryea was appointed official photographer for the 1867 visit of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, to Adelaide in 1867. He produced a bound booklet to present to His Royal Highness as a souvenir of his visit to Adelaide, and was rewarded with authority to use the slogan \\"By Royal Appointment\\". In August 1868 he commenced a series of portraits of every member of the judiciary and parliament In 1871 he made a giant mosaic of 520 men attending a banquet given for \\"Old Colonists\\" in Adelaide by the merchant Emanuel Solomon (whose daughter, Elizabeth Dorsetta Solomon, Townsend and Elizabeth along with others had assisted in 1855 to elope whilst under 21 years). In 1903 a copy of this picture was donated to the Public Library, who made every effort to identify the subjects. This reference lists those names identified to that time. A similar set of photographs (one of the men and one of the women) made by H. Jones was presented to the Library in 1910. This reference lists (where known) ship and date of arrival of each subject. Such was the rate of progress in photography in those days that photographs taken by Duryea in 1871, when shown at The Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1879, were criticised for their quality and small size, especially as compared with those of Queensland. =The Fire= His studio was destroyed by fire early on the morning of Sunday 18 April 1875. The gas main tap had not been turned off, which may have exacerbated the situation, and the storeroom contained flammable chemicals and papers, but the inquest conducted by J. M. Solomon JP could not determine the initial cause. The adjacent buildings (Victoria Chambers on King William Street and the offices of Francis Clark and Sons on Grenfell Street) were saved from severe damage by the Fire Brigade, but the incident prompted calls for a permanent Fire Station. After some dispute, the total of the ¬£1,456/13/4d claimed from his insurers was paid out, but Townsend had lost some 50,000 glass slides of inestimable historic value. Photographs salvaged from the fire were made available to the public by Duryea at the Adelaide School of Photography, 51 Rundle Street, in June 1875. Townsend Duryea left for Europe late May 1875 to organise re-stocking. The owner at the time of the fire was George Prince; rebuilding was completed by the following February. =After the Fire= By November 1875 Nixon had bought the King William Street business and put Manning in as manager. Also public notice from Saul Solomon denying responsibility for \\"peremptory demands for payment\\" issued by Duryea. Manning bought \\"Duryea's Studio\\" 1 April 1878 from Nixon In the 1890s he began offering enlargements, the use of bromide paper, and use of the \\"American airbrush\\" for touching up and colouring. In 1919 a company Thelma-Duryea was trading as photographers in Rundle Street. Other activities =Boatbuilding= Using the experience of boatbuilding he had acquired in America, he built the 30 foot centre-board cutter Coquette, intended for trade on the River Murray and Lake Albert, on Magill Road behind the Maid and Magpie Hotel. Coquette had her first real trial at Wellington against two entirely different classes of boat and failed to show superiority but in a widely anticipated race at Milang on 23 September 1858, she won convincingly against the Lady MacDonnell owned by Hughes and Carter of Wellington. In a return match on 21 October, Coquette led all the way, on each occasion winning for her owner ¬£50. Duryea disposed of the boat by raffle later that year. A later owner was H. Moseley, owner of Glenelg's Pier Hotel. In 1865 he fitted a steam engine to her, renamed her Enterprise and used her for collecting oysters. =Duryea Mining Association= Townsend's original training was as a mining engineer, and formed a company Duryea and Co. which bought several claims at Wallaroo, section 471 being proved highly prospective, having near the surface a seam of some of the richest ore ever found. and a prospectus released by directors Duryea, Edward John Peake SM and George Dehane in April 1861, offering shares to the public. The first General Meeting saw B. T. Finniss elected Chairman in place of the major shareholder, Mr. E. J. Peake. Other directors in 1862 were E. F. Macgeorge, H. C. Gleeson and H. C Uhlman. The first Secretary, James Litwell Alsop, sacked for neglecting his duties, was nevertheless found not guilty of embezzlement. After three years of indifferent results, the directors sold the mine to the Yorke's Peninsula Company. The mine never showed a profit. =Retirement= He moved to Yanga Farm near Yanga Lake on the Murrumbidgee some 13 km from Balranald, New South Wales. He later moved to Parkside, Glen Emu, near Balranald, where he suffered a stroke then died on 13 December 1888, after falling from a buggy in which he was riding with his daughter. Duryea Street, Balranald may have been named for him or his family. =Family= He married twice in the United States: to Madelina Paff on 20 March 1844 at Hempstead, Queens, New York and had three children; and Elizabeth Mary Smithsometimes reported as Elizabeth Murray Smith about 1854 at Long Island, New York and had five children.Noye, R.

He followed Townsend to Australia, perhaps as late as 1854, working with him and McDonald in Melbourne, Geelong, Hobart and Launceston. He left Adelaide in 1857 for Western Australia and settled at Mount Eliza near Perth where, on 18 March 1858, he married Ellen Amelia Leeder (2 October 1839 ‚Äì 16 June 1924) of Perth. and was naturalized by Act of Parliament in 1858. They had a son 1 January 1859 and later that year returned to Adelaide, resuming the partnership with his brother. His wife had another son on 18 August 1862 in Adelaide, and on 25 April 1863 the Duryea brothers dissolved their partnership.

Their children included: * Carlton Bennett Duryea (1 January 1859 ‚Äì 28 September 1911) * Alice Amelia French Duryea (12 July 1860 ‚Äì ) later Mrs Herbert Frost * Hewlett Frederick Duryea (18 August 1862 ‚Äì 1948) * Dr. Jesse Townsend Duryea (11 November 1865 ‚Äì 1927) * E. Mabelle (Maybelle?) Duryea (31 August 1875 ‚Äì 25 December 1927) later Mrs Ernest Smith * Dr. Chester Ford Duryea (22 December 1877 ‚Äì 7 November 1928) Note that many Australian newspaper references spelled his name \\"Sandford\\", almost certainly erroneously as the Naturalization Act and all US references have \\"Sanford\\". His middle name \\"Bennett\\" was seldom used in any context, even as an initial. =Mary H√ºbbe= Martha Mary H√ºbbe (1 August 1848 ‚Äì 27 January 1881), properly Anglicised as \\"Huebbe\\" but often \\"Hubbe\\", was an artist born in Macclesfield, South Australia who worked in Duryea's studio as a photo-colourist. She was a daughter of Ulrich H√ºbbe, who was largely responsible for the Torrens Title system of land registration. She married John Hood (see below) in 1871. =John Hood= John Hood (c. 1839 ‚Äì 15 May 1924) from Reading, Berkshire or Camberwell worked for Duryea from 1863 to 1869 or perhaps to 1872 He married Martha Mary Hubbe on 18 September 1871. He was appointed drawing master at Glenelg Grammar School from 1873 to 1875 as replacement for Wilton Hack, who had left for Japan. He began working as a photographer in 1880. He was working as photo-colorist for A. A. Stump from 1887. His wife died on 27 January 1881. He married again, on 14 February 1882, to Ruth Wright (n√©e Dollman). He moved to Mosman's Bay, New South Wales some time around 1900. His son J(ohn) Ulrich Hood was killed in action at Ypres, Belgium on 15 October 1917. =Henry Jones= Henry Jones (1826 ‚Äì 18 October 1911) was born in Bristol, England, trained as watchmaker and jeweller, and in 1826 migrated to Victoria, where he opened a jeweller's shop, then diversified to photography professionally. He joined Duryea in Adelaide in 1866, later had his own studio in King William Street, specialising in child portraits. A notable production was the pair of group photographs of old colonists which in 1910 they were purchased by T. R. Bowman and donated to the Public Library. His son T. H. Jones was a noted organist and choirmaster. See main article =Henry Spread= Henry Fenton Spread (1844‚Äì1890) was an Irish painter who worked with the Duryea studio from 1866, using photographs on specially prepared canvas as the basis of his painted portraits. He appears to have stayed with Townsend for around a year, and was replaced by John Hood. He moved to America, where he founded Spread's Art Academy which in 1902 became the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. =K. Bull= Knud Geelmuyden Bull (10 September 1811 ‚Äì 22 December 1889) was a painter born in Bergen, Norway, trained at the University of Copenhagen and at Dresden under Professor Johan Christian Dahl. He was transported to Australia in 1846 for forgery. He commenced working for Duryea in 1874 on a one-year contract with his virtues lauded in both newspapers (though mistakenly as \\"R. Bull\\" in the Register) throughout this time. Late in 1875, he exhibited a large landscape in Townsend's shopfront window. When the Duryea Studio re- opened in October 1875, it was under the auspices of K. Bull, with Charles Manning the operator. =Charles H. Manning= Charles Henry Manning (c. 1848 ‚Äì 10 September 1895) was born in England and migrated to Australia, settling in Moonta, South Australia. He married Emma Louisa Noble of Melbourne, Victoria on 16 April 1875. She was an accomplished artist; her painting of R. D. Ross being favourably reviewed. He had a photography business in Moonta, which he advertised for sale in June 1875. Moved to Marryatville and worked for Nixon (managing \\"Duryea's Studio\\") in 1878 and produced a notable photograph of J. Howard Clark. Louisa's skill at colouring photographs was recognised when the photograph of Mrs. R. D. Ross was exhibited at the studio in 1876. He purchased \\"Duryea's Studio\\" from Nixon in April 1878. He moved to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1887 and purchased a studio at 150 Colombo Street in July 1887. He died by his own hand, having consumed a bottle of silver nitrate. =William M. Nixon= William Millington Nixon (1 August 1814 ‚Äì 7 April 1893), was a friend of Townsend Duryea. He was born in Birmingham and came to Australia in the Havilah in 1855. He opened a gunmaker's shop on Grenfell Street in 1855, and for a short time worked with the Duryea Brothers as a photographer, specialising in mother and child portraits then opened his own studio in the Adelaide Arcade. He was the father of Stephen E. Nixon. He sold his home and extensive property in Stepney in 1858 to farm at Pomonda Point, near Wellington, South Australia, then from c. 1875 at Harborne near Deniliquin and Wanganella, New South Wales. =Stephen E. Nixon= Stephen Edward Nixon {10 August 1842 ‚Äì c. 3 February 1910} was born in Birmingham the eldest son of William M. Nixon. He married Mary Ann Ellis on 2 April 1863. They had sons Charles Millington Nixon (married Annie Blanche Newman) and Stephen Edmond Nixon (married Auguste Lydia Arnold). He was producing photographs in Kapunda, South Australia from before 1865. His business imprint can be seen here In 1871 he was declared bankrupt but in 1874 he produced a series of critically acclaimed photographs depicting mining at Kadina and Wallaroo. In June 1875 he advertised he was leaving Kadina and selling his photographic business with its two premises. (At the same time Charles H Manning was selling his business in Moonta). He took over the King William Street business (officially \\"S. E. Nixon's Studio\\" but popularly referred to as \\"Duryea's\\") with Manning as manager from late 1875 to 1878, when he sold the business to Manning. Nixon moved to Wauraltee, some 6 km south-east of Port Victoria, South Australia, where he declared himself bankrupt in 1880. Nixon started a photographic business \\"South Australian Photographic Association\\" in Kadina sometime before 1883. Around 1893 he moved to Fremantle,http://www.daao.org.au/bio/stephen-edward-nixon/version/3/?p=1 perhaps to be near to his son Charles, who was working as a photographer in the vicinity, then Wagin, Western Australia, where he died. =John A. Upton= John Alfred Upton was born in 1850 in England and arrived in Melbourne with his family around 1852. He began working as a colourist in watercolours with Duryea's successor in Bourke Street, Dr. Thomas A. Hill, being introduced to the technique by Montague Scott, then joined the Adelaide Photographic Company some time before 1867, perhaps as early as 1865. This reference also has contemporary accounts of Edmund Gouldsmith, Andrew McCormack, Harry P. Gill, J. H. Leonard, Alfred Scott Broad, Louis Tannert, W. K. Gold, John Gow, Van Kaspelen, Herbert J. Woodhouse, Thomas Parker, Francis Cottrell, John Hood, J O'Malley, J. C. Chidley and T. C. Dalwood After their studio was destroyed by fire he began executing (mostly posthumous) portraits in oils, among them the Rev. James Maughan in 1871, art connoisseur Abraham Abrahams in 1872, which was presented to the Gallery, and Mr. Justice Boothby in 1873, which was awarded a gold medal at the London Exhibition of that year. In 1875, he painted the mining executive William Shoobridge, who died in the wreck of the . He painted parliamentarian E. T. Smith and philanthropist Dr. William Wyatt in 1874. His work attracted the attention of Robert Barr Smith, who sponsored his studies at the Royal Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from around 1877 to 1880, where he met with considerable success. His portrait of the author William Howitt was well received. It is likely that he returned to Adelaide in 1881 with the offer of a position as painting master with the South Australian School of Design, but he never took the position, which has been attributed to failing health. He produced one of Governor William Robinson, painted in 1883, and in 1887 a small portrait of Bishop Reynolds, both for Catholic charities. In 1886, he painted an altarpiece for St Rose's church in Kapunda then a portrait of Adelaide's ex-mayor William Townsend and was commissioned to paint another posthumous portrait, of the ophthalmologist Charles Gosse, who had died after a coach accident. His painting of a fourteenth-century priest in an attitude of prayer once hung in the Jesuit seminary at Sevenhill, South Australia, and a painting Peasant Girl at the Shrine (1876) and a small painting Girl's Head are held by the Art Gallery of South Australia. His later history has not yet been resolved. It is probable that he achieved his ambition of revisiting Munich and never returned.

Biography  Longman was born at Bristol, the son of Ezekiel Longman and his second wife Sarah. The Longman family had been involved in the manufacture of soap for several generations and his father owned a shop and stalls in Temple Street. Longman's parents had died by the time he was nine. His father requested in his will that he be \\"especially well and handsomely bred and educated\\". From his mother he inherited a considerable amount of property at Winford, Winfrith, Rudghill, and Stroud. When Longman was seventeen his guardians - his brother Ezekiel, Nathaniel Webb, and Mrs. Thomas Coules - apprenticed him for seven years to John Osbom, a bookseller in Lombard Street, London. In 1724, when his apprenticeship was ended, he purchased the business of John Taylor or William Taylor, a bookseller in Paternoster Row for . Taylor had been the first publisher of Robinson Crusoe, and traded at the sign of the Ship and Black Swan. In time, John Osborn entered into partnership with Longman, and they traded as 'J. Osborn & T. Longman' at the sign of the Ship. They were among the original shareholders of the Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences of Ephraim Chambers, which became very successful and profitable. When Osborn, whose daughter became the wife of Longman, died in about 1734, Longman became sole owner of the business. He steadily increased the business by buying shares in sound literary properties. In 1740, he published the third volume of David Hume's first work, A Treatise of Human Nature, after he had been introduced to Hume by Francis Hutcheson. In 1744, he held the largest number of shares of Chambers's 'Cyclopaedia', owning nearly a sixth. He was one of the six booksellers, who entered into an agreement with Samuel Johnson to produce an English dictionary, the 'Plan' of which was issued in 1747. In 1753, he took into partnership his nephew Thomas, who carried on the business. Longman married Mary Osborn, daughter of John Osborn in 1731. They had no children. Longman died, apparently childless, on 18 June 1755.

These guns were developed in 1845, when French inventor Louis-Nicolas Flobert created the first rimfire metallic cartridge by modifying a percussion cap to hold a small lead bullet. In the 19th century, gallery guns were typically pump action rifles chambered in .22 short. Gallery guns are still manufactured, although by the late 20th century, they have been eclipsed by airguns for the purpose of indoor shooting. Gallery guns Winchester Model 1890 Gallery Gun Gallery guns are smallbore, single-shot or pump action rifles, typically chambered in .22 Short. Some of the more popular guns are the Winchester Model 1890, Colt Lightning Carbine, Gevarm open bolt and the Winchester Model 62. Home shooting parlors and galleries began to decline in the early 20th century. However, gallery guns went on to be used in shooting galleries in carnivals, fairs and amusement parks. By the late 20th century, gallery guns have been eclipsed by airguns for the purpose of indoor shooting. Gallery guns are still manufactured, although they are primarily used for plinking and small game hunting. Flobert guns Picture of a 6mm Flobert pistol, together with its description in the 1912 catalogue of the Manufacture Fran√ßaise d'Armes et de Cycles de Saint √âtienne Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Flobert invented the first rimfire metallic cartridge in 1845.

In Europe, the .22 BB cap (introduced in 1845) and the slightly more powerful .22 CB cap (introduced in 1888) are both called 6mm Flobert and are considered the same cartridge. These cartridges have a relatively low muzzle velocity of around to . Flobert also made what he called \\"parlor guns\\" for this cartridge, as these rifles and pistols were designed to be shot in indoor shooting parlors in large homes. Parlor pistols Remington Rider Single Shot Pistol Parlor pistols came into fashion in the mid-19th century; they typically featured heavy barrels and were chambered in a small caliber. They were used for target shooting in homes with a dedicated parlor or gallery for this purpose. The Remington Rider Single Shot Pistol was one of the better-known American-made parlor guns. Saloon gun Saloon guns were smoothbore weapons that fired 6mm Flobert rounds, but can refer to a large caliber firearm that was made to shoot a smaller caliber round in indoor shooting galleries by use of a chamber insert called a Morris tube. The Morris tube was shaped to the cartridge that the weapon was capable of firing and inside this tube was a smaller chamber for the round (typically .255 Morris) to fit.

The outlet feeds into the south branch of the Ashburton River / Hakatere. Located in the upper reaches of the Rangitata River a small village of holiday homes, also called Lake Clearwater, is located between Lake Clearwater and the smaller neighbour Lake Camp.

Road access to Lake Clearwater is approximately 38 km past Mount Somers and the last half is an unsealed gravel road. No dogs or motor powered craft are permitted on the lake as it is a wildlife reserve, however strong and consistent winds funnelled off the bounding mountains make it an ideal lake for windsurfing and kitesurfing. The adjacent, and smaller, Lake Camp is used by motor powered water craft. Great crested grebe The great crested grebe found at Lake Clearwater is the reason for the reserve. It is also largest member of the grebe family found in the Old World, with some larger species residing in the Americas. They measure long with a wingspan and weigh . It is an excellent swimmer and diver, and pursues its fish prey underwater. The adults are unmistakable in summer with head and neck decorations. In winter, this is whiter than most grebes, with white above the eye, and a pink bill. It is the largest European grebe. The young are distinctive because their heads are striped black and white. They lose these markings when they become adults. References Clearwater ","title":"Lake Clearwater"},{"id":"34496961","text":"Daniel Barrett is a visual effects supervisor.

The district consists of 22 large, originally single-family homes on spacious lots, with associated structures. Many of the houses were homes of prominent businessmen and financiers. The first house in the district was built by Joel S. Fisk in 1862. His grandsons, also businessmen, later carved lots from Joel's large parcel for their homes. With . The houses include, in order of construction: * The 1862 Italianate Joel S. Fisk House is at 123 N. Oakland Avenue, topped with a square cupola. Joel was a lawyer, postmaster, and register of deeds for the U.S. Land Office in Green Bay. He also started a fishing operation and platted the City of Fort Howard. * The 1888 Nathan Harden house was built as a simple 1.5-story front-gabled house, a common type then. Around 1910 the original front porch was replaced with the current porch and the dormers were probably added. * The fine 1888 Queen Anne-style Antoinette Blesch house is at 161 N. Oakland. Antoinette's husband Francis ran the Blesch Brewery and died in 1879. After that, her son Frank (see below) had this house built for his mother. * The 1890 cross-gabled Queen Anne Harry W. Fisk house at 840 Shawano Ave. * The 1890 George W. Fisk house at 834 Shawano was originally a cross-gabled Queen Anne very much like the Harry Fisk house next door at 840 Shawano, but in the 1920s it was updated to Colonial Revival style, with the columns and pediment of the front door, and the arcaded porch. George was secretary of Fisk Land and Lumber Company, and involved in Fisk Insurance Agency. * The 1899 Benjamin Garlock house at 805-807 Dousman is a large, later, less elaborate Queen Anne house. Benjamin was a carpenter and contractor. * The 1903 Mrs. Henrietta McGuire house at 712 Dousman is a 2.5-story, formal Queen Anne-style house with an octagonal tower at its southwest corner. D.J. Gallagher house * The 1909 D.J. Gallagher house at 803 Oregon Street combined the asymmetry and wrap-around porch of Queen Anne style with the pedimented gable ends, the Palladian windows, and the Tuscan columns of Neoclassical style. Gallagher was a conductor on the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. * The 1909 American Foursquare H.J. Selmer house at 130 N. Oakland Ave. * The 1909 Austin Larsen house at 616-618 Dousman combines the flat roof of Mission style with a front porch with Craftsman elements, all coated in stucco. The house is large, with a porte-coch√®re added in 1918. This combination of styles is unique in Green Bay. * The 1911 Mary Brogan house on the corner at 303 N. Ashland is a massive, 2.5 story Queen Anne, with a 3-story tower and matching carriage house. Exterior ornamentation is limited for Queen Anne, which is typical of the later designs. * The 1912 M. McGuire house at 716 Dousman is classic American Foursquare style. * The 1912 2.5-story Prairie School Harry W. Fisk house at 137 N. Oakland Ave was designed by Foeller & Schober of Green Bay. * The 1915 Prairie Style George W. Fisk house at 830 Shawano Avenue is a large 2.5 story house with a corner tower and hip roof. * The 1915 Frank Blesch house at 149 N. Oakland, designed by H.A. Foeller with a 2-story portico, is the best example of Classical Revival style in west Green Bay. Blesch managed Jorgenson-Blesch, the largest dry goods/mercantile store in Green Bay at the turn of the century. * H.J. Selmer's second house in the district at 140 N. Oakland was built in 1919, a clean fusion of American Foursquare layout with the horizontal emphasis and banded windows of Prairie Style, with a Classical Revival-like front porch. * The 1922 A.J. Selmer Craftsman bungalow at 126 N. Oakland Ave was designed by Foeller & Schober of Green Bay. * The 1926 Tudor Revival Rafeld house at 820 Shawano Avenue. Rafeld was a manager at Metropolitan Life Insurance. * The 1930 American Foursquare/International style Harry Mock House at 816 Shawano, built for a supervisor for the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad.

The company was founded in 2002 by ticket broker Don Vaccaro and software developer Doug Kruse. It operates several retail sites and partners with large name brand travel and media companies. In 2015, TicketNetwork signed an exclusive agreement with ATBS to provide Private Label Websites to their Private Label Affiliates. Operations TicketNetwork operates under a model similar to eBay, where tickets are listed on the company's marketplace, but transactions are handled by the individual seller. Buyers are charged a service fee for tickets purchased, plus a delivery fee, depending on the method of delivery, location, and time until the event. Once the tickets are available, the seller ships them directly to the buyer. Sellers are able to list and manage tickets on the marketplace via the TicketNetwork Point of Sale software. =Properties= TicketNetwork operates several retail websites such as TicketNetwork.com and TicketLiquidator.com. It also sponsors an annual trade show called Ticket Summit, which attracts resellers and other ticket industry figures. Additionally, the company operates the Better Ticketing Association, a website containing information and resources for the ticket resale industry. TicketNetwork also sells the tickets uploaded to their marketplace with their Private Label Program which has created controversy. = Green Initiative = TicketNetwork's campus features several amenities tied to the company's \\"Green Initiative.\\" A community garden covers substantial acreage of the company headquarters campus in Connecticut. It produces fruit, vegetables, and herbs that are regularly made available for staff to take home, as well as being used in the company cafeteria. There is also an animal sanctuary on the campus, which is home to several llamas, goats, gees, chickens, and pigs as of spring 2020. In the spring of 2019, construction was completed on a 1.4MW solar system on the roof of the headquarters building. The array, which features 4,365 solar panels, is one of the largest of its kind in Connecticut and produces energy offsetting an estimated 68% of the building's electrical use. = Covid-19 Pandemic Response = In the wake of the sudden shutdown of live events during the COVID-19 pandemic, TicketNetwork rapidly enacted cost- cutting measures in order to ensure the company's continued operation through the crisis. Customers holding tickets to cancelled events were given the option of vouchers good towards future event purchases, and senior staff members unanimously agreed to a pay cut, allowing the business to avoid large layoffs despite the precipitous drop-off in sales revenue. Controversies The ability for any seller to list tickets at any time has resulted in litigation. In 2009 New Jersey's then-Attorney General Anne Milgram filed a lawsuit against several parties, including TicketNetwork, for allegedly selling and advertising tickets before they were available from the venue. The suit was filed by Milgram following reports that primary seller Ticketmaster redirected customers to its TicketsNow website after Bruce Springsteen tickets sold out on Ticketmaster's main website. The case was dismissed in August 2010 after Judge Patricia K. Costello ruled that under federal law TicketNetwork was not liable for incorrect information about the availability of tickets because it was not the seller. In July 2011 TicketNetwork received a $4.5 million and $1.8 million loan as part of the State of Connecticut's First Five Program, in exchange for hiring at least 200 people over two years time. TicketNetwork also received a $250,000 grant for the training of engineers. TicketNetwork was removed from this program after its then CEO, Don Vaccaro, was arrested in February 2012 after behaving inappropriately while intoxicated. After completing an accelerated rehabilitation program, the charges were dropped. The National Action Network admitted that they investigated and interviewed the witnesses to the event within 2 months of the incident. All the four witnesses, all African Americans, confirmed that there was no racial slur uttered. After that, they reached out to Vaccaro to help. In July 2019, TicketNetwork (along with Ticket Galaxy) reached a $1.55M settlement to resolve a lawsuit with the Attorney General of New York for \\"misleading tens of thousands of customers into purchasing speculative tickets for concerts and other live events\\". The lawsuit was prompted by a WNBC investigation in October 2018 into issues with sales of Broadway tickets.

The RDCRN is designed to advance medical research on rare diseases by providing support for clinical studies and facilitating collaboration, study enrollment and data sharing. Through the RDCRN consortia, physician scientists and their multidisciplinary teams work together with patient advocacy groups to study more than 200 rare diseases at sites across the nation. Established by Congress under the Rare Diseases Act in 2002, the RDCRN has included more than 350 sites in the United States and more than 50 in 22 other countries. To date, they have encompassed 237 research protocols and included more than 56,000 participants in studies ranging from immune system disorders and rare cancers to heart and lung disorders, brain development diseases and more.

It was Europe's largest carpooling network. In 2015, it was acquired and folded into BlaBlaCar. History carpooling.com started as a student project, and was established in Munich, Germany in 2001 by the three founders Stefan Weber, Matthias Siedler and Michael Reinicke. The intention of the original website, mitfahrgelegenheit.de, was to enable people with limited budget to travel, while addressing their concern for the environment. By sharing a ride, people could save gas and money, reduce auto emissions and meet new friends. In 2003 already, through word of mouth, mitfahrgelegenheit.de became the largest carpooling site in Germany and by 2008, the founders decided to focus on it full-time. As the popularity of the platform grew, the business began to generate revenue through key partnerships (i. e. with German automobile club ADAC, Deutsche Bahn, ProSiebenSat.1 etc.) and advertising. The site was then launched in Austria and Switzerland, the German-speaking neighboring countries. In 2009, following a venture capital investment from Earlybird Venture Capital, the company expanded to France, Italy, Poland, Greece, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Greece. In 2011, the company re-branded as carpooling.com and hired Markus Barnikel, a former Yahoo! senior executive as its new CEO in November 2011. The economic crisis, mobile technology, rising environmental awareness and the emerging trend of collaborative consumption continued to fuel the growth of carpooling in Europe. In 2012, carpooling.com became a global leader in ridesharing with 1 million people transported each month across 40 countries in Europe. The site teamed up with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and innovative cities wishing to implement sustainable mobility solutions. In July 2012, the German automobile manufacturer Daimler AG invested $10 million in carpooling.com. This was to help the company prepare its launch in the United States, where carpooling seemed to be making a comeback. In 2013, the company launched a partnership with Uber. The company was sold to its competitor BlaBlaCar in April 2015 for an undisclosed amount. Features Carpooling.com enabled drivers to offer available seats online and passengers to find a ride. People could select the users that they want to ride with, how much space and comfort they needed, where they wanted to meet and what they were willing to pay. People could also book and pay for a seat online and drivers and passengers could rate each other after a ride. The service could be accessed from a computer, a mobile phone (iPhone, Android) or Facebook. It was available in seven languages and localized in 9 countries. The site also offered rides on train, bus and planes to give passengers a link to their final destination.

Plot summary Set towards the end of World War I, in 1918, it tells the story of a shy young railway employee and amateur actor from Milwaukee named Paul Peachy. Having realized that his wife no longer loves him, Paul enlists as a private in the U.S. Army and boards ship for the trenches of France. Peachy finds temporary solace in friendship amid horrors of war, but is soon captured by the enemy Germans in No Man's Land. His only chance of survival is to impersonate one of the enemy's most famous spies (as a child of immigrants, he is a fluent German speaker). As the urbane and accomplished spy Harry Stroller, Peachy is feted as a hero by the German top brass and gains access to a previously unimagined world of sumptuous living. But his new role also reveals inner reserves of courage and ingenuity he never knew he possessed, as the mounting suspicions of his German hosts force Peachy into ever more outrageous deceptions. In this atmosphere of smoke and mirrors, Paul Peachy falls in love with Annie, a beautiful French courtesan who seems to see through his artful disguise. Review and criticism My French Whore is a romantic comedy of errors and deceptions. A reviewer stated that the \\"writing [is] sparse but perfect, and the dialogue [is] wonderful.\\" In presenting his book, Gene Wilder himself wrote on a blog: My French Whore is my memo to the masses who cried out Give us more of the same! Very well, liebchens. You would like to re-live the black comedy of The Producers? I give you the madcap tale of an American soldier who impersonates a German spy, with hilarious but sombre results. Picture much hollering, in German! SCHNELL und ACHTUNG! Other reviewers have written that Wilder's character development was scarce and irregular, whereas still others stated that Wilder's novel was a touching debut novel \\"a simple, straight- faced love story about a brave coward and a scarlet,\\" where the language was humorous, with characters who had depth and charm. Finally, a writer for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Wilder‚Äôs delightful fiction debut (is) a novel so witty, dramatic and romantic that the reader is left with an indelible mental movie.\\" Overall, Wilder's first novel had a fair reception and good sales.

He is considered one of the most famous German engravers of animals, particularly horses, hounds and hunting scenes. He began his training in Ulm with the painter Christoph Resch (1701‚Äì16), and later studied under Johann Falch (1687‚Äì1727) in Augsburg. He learned the art of engraving from Georg Philipp Rugendas. On the invitation of Wolf, Freiherr von Metternich (1706‚Äì31), he spent three years in Regensburg: his coursing and visits to the riding school there proved decisive for his development. His engraved, etched and scratched sheets show the animals in characteristic movements and positions in a landscape environment. The ornamental movements in his works show visibly Rococo stylistic tendencies. He later founded his own art publishing house in Augsburg, where most of his works appeared. In 1759 he became the director of the Augsburg Stadtakademie. His drawings were often executed with precision and taste and hence his work was held in high esteem and was also transferred to decoration, porcelain and ceramics.

The project was cancelled following the expulsion of Axis forces from North Africa in May 1943. Had it entered service, the tank's designation would likely have been M16/43: \\"M\\" for Medio, \\"16\\" representing the vehicle's weight in metric tons and \\"43\\" being the planned year of introduction.Carro Celere Sahariano Development In early 1941, the Italian Army requested that Fiat and Ansaldo develop a low profile tank to counter the faster and more heavily armed A-13 series tanks exemplified by the Crusader tank. Fiat-Ansaldo began the new tank project in June 1941 by creating a wooden mock-up on a M14/41 medium tank chassis, inclining the tank's armour plates to create a glacis. The armour remained, like other contemporary Italian tanks of the period, bolted rather than welded together and generally thinner than tanks of other countries. Many different engines, including petrol-fueled aircraft engines, were tested on the chassis before development of the Sahariano tank was halted. At the time of cancellation a 275 hp gasoline engine was being tested. An elongated M14/41 turret housing a 47 mm 47/40 L40 was tested on the Sahariano tank and would also be used by the M15/42 medium tank. There were plans to later fit a 75 mm gun on the production model of the Sahariano tank as well. The Sahariano was the first Italian tank to feature a modified Christie suspension system,albeit without the road wheel/track conversion system a more robust and faster suspension system than the leaf spring bogies used on previous Italian tank designs. Ansaldo based the Sahariano's suspension on British tanks encountered in North Africa and a captured Soviet BT-5 from the Spanish Civil War. By the time of the project's cancellation, the design looked very similar to their British counterparts but with a notably lower design profile, making the tank easier to conceal and more difficult to hit. Several factors contributed to the project's demise: the concurrent development of the Carro Armato P 40 heavy tank; the strain of introducing a new tank model on an already weakened Italian industrial base; the potential of license production of foreign tanks such as the Czechoslovakian T-21 medium tank; and, most decisively, Italy's loss of its Libya colony and the seeming end of a need for a fast tank.

Incident at Fort William and Mary In December 1774 HMS Canceaux attempted to restore order to Fort William and Mary following the seizure of supplies by colonial forces led by Paul Revere. The fort, located on New Castle Island near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was seen as essential to reasserting control over the insurrection mounting amongst the populace. The concern caused by the colonial seizure of sixteen cannon and about one hundred barrels of gunpowder prompted the Canceaux to quickly depart Boston for Portsmouth.Henry Mowat, Henry Mowat logbook extract from HMS Canceaux, 1775. Library of Congress. Last accessed 05‚Äì10‚Äì2016. She arrived four days after the colonial forces had taken said resources from the fort. She was then grounded by the local maritime pilot and thus remained within an estuary of the Piscataqua River, stranded for many days. Involvement in Thompson's War In early spring of 1775 Canceaux was actively patrolling the coastline of New England in an attempt to prevent smuggling and enforce British law. She anchored in Casco Bay in March to prevent colonists from enforcing the First Continental Congress boycott of all goods from Britain. The militia of Brunswick, Maine controlled by Samuel Thompson, endeavored to drive the ship and her crew from the region in order to regain their authority within the city. After a militia boarding party in small boats had been deterred by grapeshot from Canceaux cannon, the local militia changed tack. Rather than targeting the entire ship and her crew they narrowed their sights upon the ship‚Äôs commander Lieutenant Henry Mowat. While the Lieutenant endeavored to arrange church services for his crew he was kidnapped and held by Thompson‚Äôs militia. This obvious affront to the authority of the British Navy and this crew in particular engendered ire amongst the crew and loyalist population alike. The highest ranking officer remaining aboard Canceaux, the first lieutenant, threatened the local populace to release Mowat or else they would begin to shell the city. The crew initially discharged the cannon loaded only with gunpowder, but no shot, in a veiled threat to the surrounding people. This threat was met by Thompson with the claim that for each shell fired at Falmouth, Mowat would lose a finger. By now the cannon fire had attracted local minutemen to Falmouth where they proceeded to loot the homes and valuables of loyalists residing in the city. The confrontation was eventually resolved as the local populace convinced Thompson to release the British commander. Mowat returned to Canceaux but was unable to take any locals into custody for his abduction, a reality that infuriated the commander. She eventually departed from Casco Bay to return to Boston to resume her typical activities of patrolling to preventing smuggling and enforcing British maritime law. Summer 1775 Following her failures at Fort William and Mary, her involvement in Thompson‚Äôs War and the continued insurrection permeating thought the maritimes and New England‚Äôs coast, HMS Canceaux resumed the activities typical of a Royal Navy ship of the time. Her activities were primarily focused upon patrolling the coastline and preventing the illegal trade activities supported by colonial forces.Mowat Genealogy. Notes for Captain Henry Mowat. Last Accessed 05‚Äì10‚Äì2016. http://mowatfamilyhistory.ca/ps03/ps03_497.htm Throughout the summer she fulfilled said function in order to enforce the laws and weaken the American efforts at insurrection. She captured many ships thought the summer including those smuggling between colonial ports and even those smuggling internationally. She habitually escorted captured ships and impressed crewmen regularly. While this period represents a time of far greater success for HMS Canceaux in securing the region and subordinating the colonial forces and ships, it is also a time of greater cruelty, at least when viewed through the perspective of a colonist.

Admiral Graves placed Lieutenant Mowat in charge of the plans for the retribution razing of seaports Marblehead, Salem, Gloucester, Ipswich, Newburyport, Portsmouth, Saco, Falmouth, and particularly Machias.Leamon, James S. Revolution Downeast: The War for American Independence in Maine (1995) University of Massachusetts Press pp.69‚Äì70 He was placed at the command of a flotilla containing five ships including Canceaux. The exact armaments are still contested but it is believed that Canceaux was accompanied by the Cat, HMS Halifax, HMS Symmetry and HMS Spitfire. These ships were a 20 gun ship, a 12 gun schooner, a supply ship and a bomb sloop respectively. The supply ship served as a magazine for the bomb sloop during this engagement. As a safety measure to prevent loss of a ship through accidental ignition of unfired incendiary carcasses, carcasses were transferred by lighter from the non-firing supply ship to the bomb sloop as needed. The exact armaments onboard Canceaux are unknown but it is believed that she carried six ships guns of an unknown poundage. The fleet proceeded north as instructed by Graves, choosing to focus upon Falmouth. In an overt attempt to avenge the insults made by the local populace during Thompson‚Äôs War, Mowat resolved to raze the city. On 18 October 1775, he ordered the nine- hour bombardment with incendiary ammunition of the settlement home to two thousand individuals.Henry Mowat, Henry Mowat logbook extract from HMS Canceaux, 1775. Library of Congress. Last accessed 10 May 2016. While this on its own would have been enough to horrify the colonial populace he also commanded his men to continuously raid the area, regularly sending parties ashore to set additional fires. Throughout the onslaught the British forces were able to capture four vessels and destroy eleven more, dealing even greater damage to the maritime-dependent community. While the mission to terrorize the populace was successful, this mission was overall detrimental to the war efforts of the British. The expedition wasted large mounts of British resources and resulted in the immobilization of Graves‚Äô forces. Final years  Following her experiences from summer 1775, HMS Canceaux was in need of repairs and thus was once again sent to the Royal Dockyards on the Thames. After having reached Gallion‚Äôs Reach in January of 1776 the extensive damaged caused by her time in Falmouth was repaired, restoring Canceaux to her former glory. She would return to America in the following April to live out the remainder of her time patrolling and surveying the coast of New England and the Maritimes.

He is the founder of Straight Blast Gym International (SBGI), an association of over 35 gyms worldwide engaged in training athletes in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, wrestling, boxing. Muay Thai, and mixed martial arts, based in Portland, Oregon. He is well known in the martial arts community for his promotion of the concept of \\"aliveness\\" in training, as well as for being one of the first gyms to feature cross training in boxing and other fighting sports at the beginning of the growth of the sport of Mixed Martial Arts in the 1990s. He was among the first American-born practitioners to receive a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He is a 4th degree black belt under Chris Haueter. Early years After growing up in the Bay Area of California, Matt joined the US Army where he began his involvement with martial arts as a boxer. In 1988 after leaving the Army he returned to the USA and began training in Jeet Kune Do (JKD), training which he continued in Portland, Oregon as a manager and trainer at a gym focused on JKD. It was in this period that he first began to question aspects of traditional martial arts training methods, and began to formulate his concepts. In 1991 he attended a training session with renowned Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitor Rickson Gracie. He has recounted this as a breakthrough experience: \\"I watched Rickson wrestle a room of Judo black belts. He tapped them all out within seconds, without using his hands, and I knew this is for me!\\" This began an intensive immersion in BJJ, which included training under Rickson, from whom he received his blue belt in 1992, and later training under Chris Haueter, who subsequently awarded him purple, brown and black belts in BJJ. Straight Blast Gym Matt founded the first Straight Blast Gym in Salem, Oregon in 1992, in an effort to create a gym that allowed athletes to train with aliveness. This was the key organizing concept that Thornton created to tie together the various innovations that he had been developing. It included the elimination of the focus on static forms, known in Japanese martial arts as kata, that typified most martial arts training in the United States and much of the world at that time. In 1994 a larger gym in Portland, Oregon was opened, and remains the headquarters for the Straight Blast Gym international association. Thornton's emphasis on training against resisting opponents, cross training in several martial arts, and inclusion of boxing and wrestling as part of the training were unique for martial arts schools at the time, most of which were focused on Asian fighting systems which emphasized forms and repetitive drills as the methods to gain skills. The timing of the beginnings of the Straight Blast Gym coincided with the first widely popularized mixed martial arts competitions, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), which had its first televised match, UFC 1, in November 1993. The domination of the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighter Royce Gracie simultaneously raised interest in Jiu Jitsu and created the first wave of athletes looking to train effectively for this type of competition. Thornton's training methods seemed better suited to the intense competition of this new MMA arena than highly constrained rules used in martial arts such as Tae Kwon Do, or those which had little or no full force sparring, such as most forms of Kung Fu being practiced at the time. As a result Thornton was able to attract a few dedicated mixed martial arts competitors, including Randy Couture to the gym, and this led to synergistic improvements in the training methods used. Couture went on to become a six-time UFC champion and won the UFC 13 tournament. Now retired, he continues to reference his training under Thornton at Straight Blast Gym as helpful in his growth as a fighter. Other notable MMA fighters trained by SBG include John Kavanagh*, former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Forrest Griffin, and Rory Singer, a professional fighter and contestant on the popular reality TV show \\"The Ultimate Fighter\\". SBG is also well known for questioning many other traditions in martial arts training, including the use of Japanese, Chinese and Korean terminology (in English speaking countries), the use of Asian honorifics for teachers, such as Sifu, and the tradition of progression through the ranks via formalized testing. Many norms associated with the Western style of teaching, such as addressing teachers as \\"coach\\" were substituted. Recently Thornton has been applying many of his ideas to the discipline of philosophy, where he champions skepticism, rationality, and the scientific method and opposes faith based belief systems and mysticism. He has guest lectured in philosophy classes on these topics at Portland State University and other venues. When not travelling to his various affiliates internationally, Thornton coaches at his Portland, Oregon academy. In 2019 Matt released his \\"Mastering the Mount\\" Instructional. His first new instructional in 15 years. SBG International Association As Thornton's renown grew he became a well-known figure in martial arts world and was frequently featured in martial arts magazines championing 'aliveness'* and other concepts of his training methods. His training expanded from his own gym in Oregon into over 400 training seminars at martial arts training facilities worldwide. Beginning in 1998 Matt's seminars were made available as commercial video tapes, which further spread his ideas and reputation in the martial arts community. The popularity of his methods and philosophy led to the formation of several affiliated gyms beginning in the late 1990s. In 2001 this was formalized as the Straight Blast Gym International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Association*. As of 2012 the Straight Blast Gym international organization includes over 35 gyms worldwide including locations in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Iceland, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, and UK.

Twenty-nine are National Guard units (regiments, battalions, companies, batteries or troops); one is a Regular Army Field Artillery battalion. Of the twenty-nine National Guard units, twenty-eight trace their origins to units initially organized in the English colonies; one is derived from militias formed on Puerto Rico when that island was still under Spanish rule. The units from the English colonies were formed during three distinct periods. The first eight, formed between 1636 and 1672, were formed for frontier defense shortly after settlements were established in New England and Virginia. The next eight, formed between 1735 and 1756, were raised for a variety of functions, including frontier defense, expansion into new areas further inland from the original settlements, and for actions against native tribes allied with the French, who were challenging the British for the control of North America. The last group of twelve, formed between 1774 and 1778, were raised for their immediate use in the Revolutionary War. The units are listed chronologically from oldest to newest.  181st Infantry, MA ARNG (Sixth Massachusetts)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 181st Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Lexington, Boston, Quebec, Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, Monmouth, New Jersey 1776, New York 1776, New York 1780, and Rhode Island 1778. The 181st and 182nd Infantry Regiments both trace their origins to the North Regiment, organized on December 13, 1636, from militia units at Charlestown, New Town, Watertown, Dedham, and Concord. In 1643 the North Regiment was redesignated as the Middlesex Regiment.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 181st Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 354‚Äì355. The first major military action of the Middlesex Regiment was in King Philip‚Äôs War (1675‚Äì1676), a conflict that had profound effects on the colonization of New England and the fate of the Native people there. King Philip, a Wampanoag chief whose Indian name was Metacom, organized a confederation of tribes to resist the expansion of white settlements in southern New England. King Philip was the son of Massasoit, the chief who had been the architect of the initial collaborative relationship between the colonists and the Indians. The war ended that relationship and replaced it with one in which the colonists were dominant and the Native people were marginalized. The conflict was precipitated when Wampanoag braves killed several cattle owned by a colonist, who retaliated by killing an Indian. The Indians then responded by attacking Swansea, Massachusetts, after which the conflict rapidly degenerated into a brutal cycle of raids, massacres and reprisals in an area that stretched from the Mount Hope peninsula in Rhode Island to central Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. Personnel from the Middlesex Regiment participated in the Great Swamp Fight on December 19, 1675. This campaign, involving approximately a thousand militiamen from the Connecticut, Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies, was a pre-emptive strike on the fortified winter encampment of the Narragansetts, who had remained neutral in the conflict up to that time but whom the colonists feared might join forces with King Philip. Between five and six hundred Indians were killed in the attack. The surviving Narragansetts then joined King Philip and began attacking and burning settlements in southeastern New England. The war ended in 1676 when King Philip was hunted down and killed near Swansea, his body drawn and quartered, and his head displayed on a pole in Plymouth. The conflict took the lives of eight percent of the male population of the Plymouth Colony and resulted in the near annihilation of several Indian tribes.Philbrick 2006, pp. 229‚Äì348. The colonial predecessor of the 772d Military Police Battalion and 102nd Infantry (see below) also participated in King Philip's War. The Middlesex Regiment was expanded in 1680 and divided into two regiments: the Lower (or 1st) and Upper (or 2nd) Middlesex Regiments. The 181st Infantry traces its lineage back to the 2nd Middlesex Regiment; the 182d Infantry, to the 1st Middlesex Regiment. While remaining in state service during the Revolutionary War, the 2nd Middlesex Regiment was expanded on February 19, 1776, to form the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Middlesex Regiments. On April 23, 1775, these regiments were reorganized to produce five regiments in the new Continental Army: Prescott's, Thomas's, Nixon's, Brewer's, and Bridge's Regiments. Bridge's Regiment was disbanded later in the year. * Prescott's Regiment became the 7th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776. On January 1, 1776, the 7th Continental Regiment was consolidated with the 23rd Continental Regiment (see Thomas's Regiment below) to form the 2nd Massachusetts Regiment. Prescott's Regiment played a prominent role at the Battle of Bunker Hill and the evacuation of Long Island.Boatner 1974, p. 887. * Thomas's Regiment was redesignated as Bailey's Regiment on July 1, 1775, then consolidated with Cotton's Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775) on January 1, 1776, to form the 23rd Continental Regiment, following which the 23rd and 7th Continental Regiments were consolidated to form the 2nd Massachusetts Regiment. * Nixon's Regiment became the 4th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776, and then the 6th Massachusetts Regiment in 1779. Nixon's Regiment was in action at Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston and the defense of New York City.Boatner 1974, p. 809. * Brewer's Regiment became the 6th Continental Regiment in 1776, Wiggleswoth's Regiment in 1777, and the 13th Massachusetts Regiment in 1779. In 1785 the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Middlesex Regiments were reorganized as the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, which, after a number of additional reorganizations and redesignations, became the 6th Regiment of Infantry in 1855 and the 181st Infantry in 1921. The 181st Infantry also perpetuates the lineage of the 104th Infantry, MA ARNG (Second Massachusetts), as a consequence of the consolidation of the 104th and 181st Infantry Regiments on September 1, 2006, with the newly formed unit retaining the designation of the 181st Infantry. The 181st Infantry's credit for the Quebec Campaign was acquired when it was consolidated with the 104th Infantry. The 104th Infantry traces its history back to the Hampshire Regiment, Massachusetts Militia, constituted on May 7, 1662, and organized in 1663 from the existing Train Bands from Springfield (organized September 1639), Northampton (organized August 1661) and Hadley (organized May 1661). The Hampshire Regiment was expanded on November 16, 1748, into the North and South Hampshire Regiments. Then, following the formation of Berkshire County from the western portion of Hampshire County, the Berkshire Regiment was formed on January 1, 1763. On January 22, 1776, these three western Massachusetts militia units were reorganized into the Hampshire County Brigade (Timothy Danielson commanding), consisting of the 1st‚Äì6th Hampshire Regiments, and the Berkshire County Brigade (John Fellows commanding), consisting of the 1st and 2nd Berkshire Regiments. Elements of the Hampshire and Berkshire County Brigades were called into active service at various times during the Revolutionary War, and additionally provided five regiments that became part of the Continental Army. * During May and June 1775, the Hampshire and Berkshire County militias were reorganized to form four named regiments in the Massachusetts Provincial Army‚ÄìDanielson's, Fellows's, Paterson's and Woodbridge's‚Äìwhich were adopted into the Continental Army on June 14, 1775. These four regiments were reorganized in January 1776 to form the 3rd, 15th and 21st Continental Regiments, which in 1779 were reorganized again to form the 1st Massachusetts Regiment. In addition to its service in the Main Army, the 1st Massachusetts Regiment also spent time assigned to the Canadian and Northern Departments. * A fifth regiment, Porter's Regiment, was constituted on January 21, 1776, and organized during the winter and spring for a year of service in Canada, following which it was disbanded in December 1776.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 104th Infantry.

Like the 181st Infantry, the 182d Infantry also traces its origins to the North Regiment, organized from existing train bands on December 13, 1636. As noted above, the North Regiment was redesignated in September 1643 as the Middlesex Regiment, which was expanded On October 13, 1680, and divided into two regiments: the Lower (or 1st) Middlesex Regiment and the Upper (or 2nd) Middlesex Regiment. The 182d Infantry carries on the lineage of the 1st Middlesex Regiment, consisting of companies from Charlestown, Watertown, Woburn, Malden and Reading, whereas the 181st Infantry perpetuates the lineage of the 2nd Middlesex Regiment. While remaining in state service during the Revolutionary War, the 1st Middlesex Regiment was expanded in February 1776 to form two new regiments, one of which retained the designation as the 1st Middlesex Regiment, while the other was designated as a new 2nd Middlesex Regiment. During the course of the war these two regiments remained in state service, and were also reorganized to produce two named regiments that were adopted into the Continental Army: Heath's Regiment (authorized on April 23, 1775, and organized at Roxbury) and Alden's Regiment (constituted on September 16, 1777, and organized at Boston during the spring of 1777). * Heath's Regiment was redesignated on July 1, 1775, as Greaton's Regiment, which became the 24th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776. The 24th Continental Regiment was consolidated on January 1, 1777, with the 25th Continental Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775), with the resulting unit being designated as the 25th Continental Regiment. The 25th Continental Regiment ultimately became the 3rd Massachusetts Regiment on August 1, 1779. Greaton's Regiment was part of the force that pursued the British during their retreat from Lexington and Concord, and was also active in raids on British depots during the Siege of Boston.Boatner 1974, pp.l 449‚Äì450. * Alden's Regiment became the 7th Massachusetts Regiment on August 1, 1779. Alden's Regiment was present at the fort near the village of Cherry Valley in eastern New York that was attacked by a mixed force of Loyalists, British soldiers and Seneca and Mohawk warriors in November 1778. Although the fort was not captured, many residents of the village were massacred. Colonel Alden was killed during the raid.Boatner 1974, pp.221‚Äì225. In 1785 the 1st and 2nd Middlesex Regiments were reorganized as the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, which, after a number of additional reorganizations and redesignations, became the 5th Regiment of Infantry in 1855 and the 182nd Infantry in 1923.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 182nd Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 355‚Äì357. The white shield of the Distinctive Unit Insignia is from the Massachusetts state flag, and is also the original color for Infantry. The Indian is from the first seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. St. George‚Äôs cross suggests the British, or colonial, origin of the unit. The shoulder patch of the Americal Division, in which the 182nd Infantry served during World War II, occupies the upper right corner of the crest.  101st Engineer Battalion, MA ARNG (East Regiment)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 101st Eng Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Lexington, Boston, Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, Monmouth, New York 1776, New York 1777, New Jersey 1777, New Jersey 1780, Rhode Island 1777, Rhode Island 1778, Rhode Island 1779. The 101st Engineer Battalion, like the 181st and 182nd Infantry Regiments, traces its lineage back to militia units from the Boston area that date back to 1636. The 101st Engineer Battalion originated as the East Regiment, formed in the Massachusetts Militia on December 13, 1636, from existing units at Saugus, Salem, Ipswich, and Newbury. The East Regiment was redesignated as the Essex Regiment in 1643, and on October 13, 1680, the Essex Regiment was expanded to form the 1st (South) and 2nd (North) Essex Regiments, and then expanded again in 1689 to form three regiments: the 1st (Lower), 2nd (Upper) and 3rd (Middle) Essex Regiments. Then in 1774 it was expanded again to form the 1st, 2nd, 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th Essex Regiments. These six regiments were reorganized on February 19, 1776, as the Essex County Brigade, consisting of eight regiments. While the Essex County Brigade remained in Massachusetts service during the Revolutionary War, five named regiments were formed from it that were adopted by the Continental Army: Glover‚Äôs Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775, and organized at Marblehead); Mansfield‚Äôs Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775, and organized at Cambridge); Little‚Äôs Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775, and organized at Cambridge); Frye‚Äôs Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775, and organized at Cambridge); and Lee‚Äôs Additional Continental Regiment (authorized January 12, 1777, and organized at Cambridge). * Glover's Regiment became the 14th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776, and was disbanded on December 31, 1776. Glover's Regiment was an amphibious unit made up of fishermen from the area around Marblehead. It played a crucial role in the evacuation of Washington's army from Long Island across the East River and in ferrying American forces across the Delaware River prior to the attack on Trenton. It also participated actively in the Battle of Trenton.Boatner 1974, pp. 438‚Äì439. * Mansfield's Regiment first became the 27th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776, Putnam's Regiment on January 1, 1777, and finally the 5th Massachusetts Regiment on August 1, 1779. * Little's Regiment became the 12th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776. Little's Regiment was present at Bunker Hill and Long Island.Ward 1952, pp. 86‚Äì87, 215, 222, 231, 239. * Frye's Regiment was disbanded on December 31, 1775, only eight months after its formation. * Lee's Additional Continental Regiment was consolidated with Henry Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment (authorized January 12, 1777, and organized at Boston from elements of the Boston Regiment and Corps of Independent Cadets) and Henley's Additional Regiment (authorized January 12, 1777, and organized at Boston), with the new units designated as Henry Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment. Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment became the 16th Massachusetts Regiment on July 24, 1780. The 16th Massachusetts Regiment was disbanded on January 1, 1781. In the reorganization of the Massachusetts Militia following the war, the Essex County Brigade was reorganized as the 2nd Division, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Brigades. The organizational history of the 2nd Division and its elements between 1785 and 1920 is complicated. After various periods as either Infantry or Artillery, the unit was organized as the 1st Engineers in 1920 and as the 101st Engineers in 1921.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 101st Engineer Battalion The blue stripe in the Distinctive Unit Insignia represents the unit‚Äôs earlier service as Infantry, while the red shield is for service as an Engineer unit. The St. George‚Äôs cross indicates the British, or colonial, origin of the unit. The badge in the blue stripe was the insignia of the Essex Brigade.  101st Field Artillery, MA ARNG (Boston Light Artillery)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 101st FA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Monmouth, Rhode Island 1777, Rhode Island 1778, Rhode Island 1779, New Jersey 1780. The 101st Field Artillery traces its origins back to new and existing train bands in Boston, Dorcester, Roxbury, Weymouth and Higham that were organized on December 13, 1636, as the South Regiment. On September 7, 1643, the South Regiment was redesignated as the Suffolk Regiment, which was expanded in 1689 to form the Boston Regiment and the Suffolk Regiment. It was the Boston Regiment that ultimately became the 101st Field Artillery, while the Suffolk Regiment diverged to form a separate lineage. The Boston Regiment remained in Massachusetts service during the Revolutionary War, but additionally formed Henry Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment, authorized on January 12, 1777, and organized at Boston from elements of the Boston Regiment and the Corps of Independent Cadets. ::::::* Jackson's Additional Regiment was consolidated on April 9, 1779, with Lee's Additional Continental Regiment (authorized January 12, 1777, and organized at Cambridge) and Henley's Additional Continental Regiment (authorized January 12, 1777, and organized at Boston), with the consolidated unit designated as Henry Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment, which was redesignated as the 16th Massachusetts Regiment on July 24, 1780. Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment was present at the Battle of Freeman's Farm, the first phase of the Battle of Saratoga, which thwarted the British attempt to divide New England from the rest of the colonies,Boatner 1974, pp. 971‚Äì975 and the Battle of Springfield, an American victory that ended British efforts to achieve a dominant position in New Jersey.Fleming 1973, p. 302 The regiment was disbanded on January 1, 1781, at New Windsor, New York. In the reorganization of the Massachusetts Militia following the Revolutionary War, the Boston Regiment was redesignated on April 1, 1788, as the 1st Regiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Division, which was expanded, reorganized and redesignated on August 2, 1798, as the Legionary Brigade, 1st Division, to consist of the Sublegion of Artillery (Volunteer Militia), the Sublegion of Light Infantry (Volunteer Militia), and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Sublegions (Standing Militia). The 101st Field Artillery has a very complex lineage, having incorporated the following historic units into its lineage through a series of consolidations occurring in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: the National Lancers, organized in 1836; the 2nd Battalion of Light Infantry and the 3rd Regiment of Light Infantry, both organized in 1840; an infantry company in the Independent Division, Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, organized in 1863; the Company of Light Artillery, 1st Brigade, also known as the Boston Light Artillery, organized in 1853, which, through a series of reorganizations, became the 101st Field Artillery in 1917; and to four antiaircraft artillery units organized in the 1940s. Because of the complexity of its organizational history the present-day 101st Field Artillery perpetuates the lineages of the following of organizations: the 241st Coast Artillery, 187th Coast Artillery, 704th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and 704th Missile Battalion (in the lineage of the South Regiment); the 102nd Machine Gun Battalion, 110th Cavalry, 200th Field Artillery, 221st Field Artillery and 180th Field Artillery Battalions (in the lineage of the National Lancers); the 211th Field Artillery (in the lineages of the 2nd Battalion and the 3rd Regiment of Light Infantry); Company L of the 372nd Infantry, the 272nd Field Artillery Battalion and the 972nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (in the lineage of the infantry company in the Independent Division, Massachusetts Volunteer Militia); and the 126th Antiaircraft Artillery, 685th Antiaircraft Artillery, 747th Antiaircraft Artillery and 772nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalions (all organized in the 1940s).Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 101st Field Artillery. The Indian head in the Distinctive Unit Insignia is from the seal of Massachusetts from 1628. The red color of the scroll is for Artillery. The Distinctive Unit Insignia was formerly the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 211th Field Artillery, which is one of the units in the lineage of the 101st Field Artillery.  772nd Military Police Company, MA ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 211th MP Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: New York 1776 and Rhode Island 1777 The 772nd Military Police Company traces its origins to the Cohannet Train Band, Plymouth Colony Militia, organized on March 3, 1638. In 1639, the unit became the Taunton Train Band. The first major military action of the Taunton Militia was in King Philip‚Äôs War (1675‚Äì1676). The Taunton Militia defended Taunton and Swansea from attacks by King Philip‚Äôs warriors and later provided soldiers for other offensive operations that ultimately brought an end to the Indians‚Äô resistance. For a description of the involvement of other colonial militia in King Philip's War, refer to the sections on the 181st Infantry (above). The Taunton Militia became a part of the Massachusetts Militia in 1690 when the Plymouth Colony was absorbed into the Massachusetts Colony. During the century that intervened between the end of King Philip's War and the Revolutionary War, France and Great Britain fought a series of wars for the control of North America. The Taunton Militia was called upon by the British to fight against the French and their Indian allies in all of these wars: King William‚Äôs War (1689‚Äì1697), Queen Anne‚Äôs War (1702‚Äì1713), King George‚Äôs War (1744‚Äì1748) and the French and Indian War (1756‚Äì1763), which culminated in a victory for the British.Kondratiuk 2003. In 1703 the Taunton Train Band was reorganized as the Eastward Company; in 1709 as the first Foot Company, Bristol County Regiment of Militia, and in 1736 as the First Foot Company, Third Regiment of Militia, Bristol County. * In 1776 the First Foot Company, Third Regiment, Bristol County became the Third Foot Company, Third Regiment, Bristol County Brigade.Kondratiuk, 2003 The lineage of the Taunton Militia involved many reorganizations and redesignations during the rest of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But by 1917, when the modern National Guard was taking shape, it had become a Coast Artillery company, and later as a company or battery in the 101st Field Artillery. Following consolidation with the 726th Maintenance Battalion in 1967, the unit was reorganized and redesignated as the 772nd Military Police Company. Since companies are not issued their own separate Distinctive Unit Insignias, soldiers in the 772nd Military Police Company wear the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the higher echelon unit in which it serves, i.e., the 211th Military Police Battalion, MA ARNG. The 211th Military Police Battalion also has a lineage that dates back to the colonial militia (see below).  125th Quartermaster Company, MA ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 164 Trans Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Lexington, Boston, Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga and Monmouth The 125th Quartermaster Company traces its history back to December 3, 1660, when the Company of Foot, Middlesex Regiment, was organized in the Massachusetts Militia at Marlborough. When the Middlesex Regiment was expanded in 1680 to form the 1st and 2nd Middlesex Regiments, this company went into the 2nd Middlesex Regiment. Thus, the 125th Quartermaster Company shared its early history with the 181st Infantry (see above). While remaining in Massachusetts service during the Revolutionary War, this company additionally formed Captain Michael Barn's Company, Ward's Regiment, on June 14, 1775, which was adopted into the Continental Army. ::::::* Barn's Company became a company in Wesson's Regiment on January 1, 1777, and then a company in the 9th Massachusetts Regiment on August 1, 1779. ::::::* In the meantime, when the 2nd Middlesex Regiment was expanded on February 19, 1776, to form the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Middlesex Regiments, the company in the 2nd Middlesex Regiment destined to become the 125th Quartermaster Company was reorganized as the 2nd Company, 4th Middlesex Regiment. From the end of the Revolutionary War until 1873, the predecessor of the 125th Quartermaster Company served as an Infantry company in a series of different units, becoming Company E, 6th Regiment of Infantry, by which time the predecessor of the 181st Infantry had become the 6th Regiment of Infantry. The lineages of the 125th Quartermaster Company and the 181st Infantry continued to be linked until 1965 when Company C, 1st Battalion, 181st Infantry, was reorganized as Company A, 26th Supply and Transport Battalion, which was reorganized as the 125th Quartermaster Company in 1996.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 125th Quartermaster Company. Since companies are not issued Distinctive Unit Insignia, soldiers in the 125th Quartermaster Company wear the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 164th Transportation Battalion, the battalion to which it is assigned. The shield of the DUI of the 164th Transportation Battalion is the coat or arms approved for the old 241st Coast Artillery Regiment within a gold border, indicating descent from that organization. The Headquarters Detachment of the 164th Transportation Battalion traces its origin to the Headquarters Battery, 2-241st Coast Artillery.  102nd Infantry, CT ARNG (First and Second Connecticut)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 102nd Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Saratoga, New York 1776, New York 1777, Connecticut 1777, Connecticut 1778, Connecticut 1779, Connecticut 1780, Connecticut 1781 The 102nd Infantry traces its origins to the New Haven and Hartford County Regiments, Connecticut Militia, constituted on June 26, 1672, and organized from existing train bands. Elements of the New Haven militia participated in the Great Swamp Fight and other actions during King Philip's War (see 181st Infantry above). In October, 1739, the New Haven and Hartford County Regiments were reorganized and redesignated as the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Connecticut Militia. ::::::* Elements the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Connecticut Militia were called into active service during the Revolutionary War and served in New York and Connecticut. The 1st and 2nd Regiments underwent a number of reorganizations and redesignations during, and in the aftermath, of World War I. The 1st Regiment became the 169th Infantry in 1921; the 2nd Regiment, the 170th Infantry. After many more reorganizations, the 169th and 170th Infantry were consolidated in 1992 to form the 102nd Infantry.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 102nd Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 195‚Äì196. The British lion in the Distinctive Unit Insignia symbolizes Revolutionary War service against the British; the blue saltire, Civil War service with the Union; the cactus, service along the Mexican border in 1916; and the fleur-de- lis, service in France during World War I. The white shield represents service as Infantry.  192nd Military Police Battalion, CT ARNG (The Fairfield County Regiment)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 192nd MP Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Saratoga, New York 1776, New York 1777, Connecticut 1777, Connecticut 1778, Connecticut 1779, Connecticut 1780, Connecticut 1781, Rhode Island 1778 The 192nd Military Police Battalion had its origins in the Fairfield County Regiment, Connecticut Militia, which was constituted on June 26, 1672. The regiment was reorganized in 1739 as the 4th and 9th Regiments of the Connecticut Militia, consisting of companies in Norwalk, Stamford, Greenwich and Ridgefield. :::::::* During the Revolutionary War the 4th and 9th Regiments of the Connecticut Militia served in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1786 these two regiments were reorganized and expanded to form the 4th, 9th, 16th and 28th Regiments, and again in 1792 to form the 4th, 9th, 16th, 28th and 34th Regiments. In 1847 these five regiments were consolidated to form the 8th Regiment, to consist of companies from Fairfield County. After still more organizational changes in the aftermath of the Civil War and the run-up to World War I, the Fairfield County Regiment was reorganized as eight Coast Artillery companies in 1917, which were reorganized and redesignated in 1921 as the 192nd Artillery and later as the 192nd Field Artillery. In 2003 the 192nd Field Artillery was redesignated as the 192nd Chemical Battalion, which in 2006 became the 192nd Military Police Battalion.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 192nd Military Police Battalion. The cross of St. George on the Distinctive Unit Insignia is for Revolutionary War service; the blue saltire, for Civil War service with the Union, and the fleur-de-lis on the red stripe is for Artillery service in France during World War I. Earlier service as Infantry is indicated by the white in the shield, white having once been the Infantry‚Äôs color.  201st Field Artillery, WV ARNG (First West Virginia)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 201st FA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Boston, New York 1776 The 201st Field Artillery traces it origins to militia companies formed in the northern and western part of the Virginia Colony, the earliest of which was Captain Daniel Morgan‚Äôs Company of Volunteer Militia of Orange Country, Virginia, organized on February 17, 1735. In 1738 the unit was redesignated as Morgan‚Äôs Company, Frederick County Militia. Morgan Morgan is reputed to have been the first white settler in what is now the state of West Virginia.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 201st Field Artillery. ::::::* During the Revolutionary War several militia companies from this part of Virginia were organized for frontier defense and subsequently for service in Virginia regiments of the Continental Line. One such company, Captain Hugh Stephenson‚Äôs Independent Company of Virginia Riflemen, which was organized on June 14, 1775, became a part of the army that assembled around Boston in the spring and summer of 1775. Later in 1776 Captain Stephenson‚Äôs Company expanded to four companies and consolidated with two companies from Maryland to form the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. A major portion of this regiment was captured by the British at Fort Washington, New York, in 1776, following which the regimental organization was disbanded. The remaining Virginia portion was transferred in February, 1777, to the 11th Virginia Regiment; the Maryland portion to the 4th Maryland Regiment.Wright 1983, p. 319. According to a story often featured in publications by the West Virginia National Guard, when Hugh Stephenson‚Äôs and Daniel Morgan‚Äôs Independent Companies of Virginia Riflemen arrived in Boston shortly after the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, General Washington rode out to meet them, dismounted, took every man by his hand, and proclaimed ‚ÄúLet me plant my banner in West Augusta and I will surround it with fighting men who will drive the invaders from our land.‚Äù However, David McCullough presents a somewhat different reaction to the mountain men, based upon accounts by a Boston physician named James Thacher. To quote McCullough, ‚ÄúWelcome as they were at first, the riflemen soon proved even more indifferent to discipline than the New Englanders, and obstreperous to the point that Washington began to wish they had never come.‚ÄùMcCullough 2005, p. 38. Present- day members of the 201st Field Artillery are doubtless equally proud of both of these descriptions of their comrades from an earlier era. Volunteer elements of the 10th and 16th Brigades were mustered into federal service in 1794 to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion, an uprising of farmers in western Pennsylvania challenging the collection of a federal excise tax on whiskey. President Washington ordered a military force composed of militia units from four adjacent states into the area to enforce the law. In so doing he asserted the authority of the federal government to enforce federal law and gained the support of state governments for the exercise of such authority. The lineage of the militia from the western part of Virginia that became West Virginia during the Civil War is complex. The lineages of units from the southern and northern portions of the state are perpetuated by the 150th Armor (see below) and 201st Field Artillery, respectively. Although the militias from western Virginia contributed troops to both the Union and Confederate Armies, only those units with Union service are included in the lineages of the 150th Armor and 201st Field Artillery. By 1923 the units destined to become today's 201st Field Artillery had been reconstituted as the 1st Infantry Regiment, West Virginia National Guard, and organized in 1924‚Äì1926. On May 11, 1926, the 1st Infantry Regiment became the 201st Field Artillery. The blue stripe at the top of the Distinctive Unit Insignia (the chief) represents service as Infantry, while the two lions symbolize service in two wars against the British. The saltire, half blue and half gray, signifies service during the Civil War in both the Union and Confederate armies. The Roman sword indicates service in the War with Spain, and the fleur-de-lis indicates service in France during World War I.  HHD/211th Military Police Battalion, MA ARNG (First Corps of Cadets)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 211th MP Bn Revolutionary War Campaign Credits: Monmouth, Rhode Island 1777, Rhode Island 1778, Rhode Island 1779, New Jersey 1780 The Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 211th Military Police Battalion, traces its origins to the First Corps of Cadets, Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, organized in Boston on October 16, 1741, consisting of ‚Äúsixty-four young Gentlemen.‚Äù The initial mission of the First Corps of Cadets, which cherished its status as a socially elite organization, was to serve as the ceremonial bodyguard for the royal governors of the colony. During 1774 as tensions increased between Great Britain and the colonists in the Boston area, the new royal governor, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Gage, dismissed the commander of the Cadets, Lieutenant Colonel John Hancock, for his role in leading the revolt against British import duties, whereupon the Cadets voted to disband and returned their colors to the governor. ::::::* During the late spring or early summer of 1776, following the British evacuation from Boston, the Cadets reorganized as the Independent Company of Cadets, commanded by Captain Henry Jackson. In 1777 Jackson was commissioned as colonel and placed in command of a newly formed Additional Continental Regiment. The Cadets provided the officer cadre for the new regiment. The Cadets remained in state service during the war, but were activated three times during 1777 and 1778 for service in Rhode Island. In 1786 the Cadets were mobilized to serve in the militia that suppressed Shays‚Äô Rebellion, an armed uprising by farmers in western Massachusetts protesting high taxes and courts‚Äô judgments against debtors.Kondratiuk 1997. Since 1917 the First Corps of Cadets has served in a number of capacities, having at various times been designated as the 101st Engineer Regiment, the 211th Coast Artillery, as battalions in the 211th Antiaircraft Group, the 126th Tank Battalion, the 220th Infantry Regiment, the 126th Signal Battalion, and finally in 1996 as the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 211th Military Police Battalion.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 211th Military Police Battalion. The Distinctive Unit Insignia is the old badge of the First Corps of Cadets, which is a variation of the insignia of the Coldstream Guards in the British Army. The Cadets also wore a uniform similar to that worn by the Coldstream Guards. The connection between the Cadets and the Guards was their similar role as household guards‚Äìfor the sovereign in the case of the Coldstream Guards and the royal governor in the case of the First Corps of Cadets.  116th Infantry, VA ARNG (Stonewall Brigade)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 116th Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Charleston, Cowpens, Guilford Court House, Yorktown, Virginia 1775, Virginia 1776, Virginia 1781, North Carolina 1781, South Carolina 1781 The 116th Infantry had its origins in the Augusta County Regiment of Militia, which was organized on November 3, 1741. The Augusta County Regiment was called into service at various times during the French and Indian War and during Lord Dunmore‚Äôs War in 1774. Lord Dunmore‚Äôs War was a campaign against the Native tribes west of the Appalachian Mountains, initiated by the Royal Governor of Virginia, John Murray, Fourth Earl of Dunmore. The war was preceded by growing resistance by the Indians to the expansion of white settlement into what is now Kentucky. The Proclamation of 1763, issued by King George III following the conclusion of the French and Indian War, had reserved, at least temporarily, the land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River for Indian tribes, a restriction that was deeply resented by the colonists as an intrusion by Britain into colonial affairs. The war ended with the decisive defeat of a force composed largely of Shawnees and Mingos at the Battle of Point Pleasant, near the juncture of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. The Battle of Point Pleasant is often called the first battle of the American Revolution, since it was fought in defiance of British desires and also because it cleared Indian tribes that were potential allies of the British from western Virginia. During the Revolutionary War the Augusta County Regiment, or its elements, was called into service and provided the following companies to the Continental Army: Fontaine's Company, Stephenson's Company, Hayse's Company, Laird's Company and Syme's Company.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 116th Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 227‚Äì229. * Captain William Fontaine‚Äôs Company was an element of the 2nd Virginia Regiment, which was authorized on August 21, 1775, and organized at Williamsburg on October 21, 1775. The 2nd Virginia was adopted by the Continental Army on November 1, 1775, and assigned first to the Southern Department and then in 1776 to the Main Army. It was actively engaged during the defense of Philadelphia in 1777‚Äì1778. Following reassignment to the Southern Department in 1780, the regiment was captured during the surrender of Charleston.Wright 1983, pp. 283‚Äì285. * Captain David Stephenson‚Äôs Company was an element of the 8th Virginia Regiment (German Regiment), which was authorized on January 11, 1776, and organized February‚ÄìApril, 1776, at Suffolk County Court House to consist of companies from Frederick, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Berkeley, Augusta, Hampshire, Fincastle and Culpeper Counties and the West Augusta District. The 8th Virginia Regiment was adopted by the Continental Army on May 25, 1776, serving during 1776 as an element of the Southern Department during 1777‚Äì1778 and later as an element of the Main Army.Wright 1983, p. 288. * Captain John Hayse‚Äôs Company was an element of the 9th Virginia Regiment, authorized on January 11, 1776, and organized during February and March, 1776, on the Eastern Shore to consist of companies from Accomac, Northampton, Goochland, Albermarle and Augusta Counties. The 9th Virginia was adopted by the Continental Army on May 31, 1776, and was present at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown. Much of the regiment was captured at Germantown. In 1789 the 9th Virginia was consolidated with the 1st Virginia, with the consolidated unit being designated as the 1st Virginia Regiment. The unit was captured on May 12, 1780, by the British Army during the Siege of Charleston.Wright 1983, pp.288‚Äì289. * Captains David Laird‚Äôs and John Syme‚Äôs Companies were elements of the 10th Virginia Regiment, which was authorized on September 16, 1776, and assigned to the Main Army. It was organized in February 1777 to consist of companies from Augusta, Amherst, Caroline, Culpeper, Cumberland, Fairfax, Fauquier, Orange, Spotsylvania, Stafford and King George Counties. It served first in the 2nd Virginia Brigade and later in the 3rd Virginia Brigade. The 10th Virginia was reorganized and redesignated in 1779 as the 6th Virginia Regiment, and reassigned to the Southern Department. It was captured during the Siege of Charleston.Wright 1983, p. 289. The Augusta County Regiment was expanded in 1792 to form the 32nd and 93rd Regiments, and again in 1839 to form the 32nd, 93rd and 160th Regiments. By the time of the Civil War these three regiments had become five regiments that comprised the 1st Brigade, Army of the Shenandoah (later designated as the Stonewall Brigade), plus the 52nd Virginia. Through a series of subsequent reorganizations, the regiments were combined to form the 116th Infantry in 1917. The red shield of the Distinctive Unit Insignia indicates an Artillery tradition in the regiment. The gray portion of the saltire indicates Confederate service during the Civil War, while the blue portion commemorates post-Civil War service in the blue uniform of the U.S. Army. The fleur-de-lis indicates service in France during World War I.Stein 1993, p.170.  111th Infantry, PA ARNG (The Associators)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 111th Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown The 111th Infantry traces its origins to the Associators, founded on November 21, 1747, at Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin. Because of the pacifism of the Quakers who controlled the Pennsylvania Colony since its founding it 1681, Pennsylvania was the only colony that did not have a militia tradition. However, during King George's War (1744‚Äì1748), Philadelphia was threatened by French privateers operating on the Delaware River. Benjamin Franklin, realizing the necessity of having some kind of military force to defend Philadelphia, proposed an association of volunteer militia, resulting in the formation of the Associators on November 21, 1747. The 111th Infantry traces its origins to the Associators, and, therefore, is derived from the first citizen militia to exist in Pennsylvania. On December 29, 1747, the Associators were organized as the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia. They continued to exist as a citizen militia until the outbreak of the American Revolution.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 111th Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981. pp.217‚Äì219. ::::::* In 1775 the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia was reorganized as the Associators of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia, and then reorganized again on March 17, 1777, as the Philadelphia Brigade of Militia. The Philadelphia Brigade was not adopted into the Continental Army, but joined Washington's Main Army during its Trenton-Princeton Campaign. In 1793 the Philadelphia Brigade was reorganized in the Pennsylvania Militia to form the 1st Brigade, 1st Division. After many reorganizations and redesignations during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the Associators became the 110th Infantry in 1917, and the 111th Infantry in 1921. The Distinctive Unit Insignia consists of a reproduction of the statue of Benjamin Franklin by R. Tait McKenzie, honoring the role of Benjamin Franklin in organizing the Associators. The oval is blue to signify service as Infantry.  103rd Engineer Battalion, PA ARNG (The Dandy First)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 103rd Eng Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, New Jersey 1777 Like the 111th Infantry, the 103rd Engineer Battalion traces its origins to the Associators, constituted on November 21, 1747, at Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin. The original Associators included several companies of artillery, which were combined on December 29, 1747, to form the Train of Artillery of Philadelphia. It is from these artillery companies that the 103rd Engineer Battalion is derived. During the French and Indian War, these companies served at Forts Pitt and Erie. In 1775 when the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia was reorganized as the Associators of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia, it included one battalion of artillery. On May 1, 1775, this artillery battalion underwent further reorganization to form the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion under the command of Colonel Samuel Mifflin. ::::::* The Philadelphia Artillery Battalion was ordered into Continental Service on July 2, 1776, at Philadelphia, and mustered out in January 1777 at Morristown, New Jersey. During this period, the unit served in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and participated in the Trenton and Princeton campaigns. * While remaining in state service, the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion also formed Procter's 4th Company, organized in Philadelphia in October 1775, and was expanded to form the Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion in August 1776, which was assigned to the Main Continental Army in September 1776. The Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion was expanded again to form the Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment in February 1777, and relieved from the Main Continental Army. On June 10, 1777, the Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment was adopted into the Continental Army as Procter's Continental Artillery Regiment, which became the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment in 1783.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 103rd Engineer Battalion. At the Battle of Fort Washington, Margaret (‚ÄúCaptain Molly‚Äù) Corbin, the wife on an enlisted man in one of the companies of the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion, became the first American woman to be wounded on the battlefield and later the first woman to be paid a pension by the U. S. government for her service. When her husband, John Corbin, was killed during the assault on Fort Tryon, a small outer redoubt of Fort Washington, she took his place in the gun crew, cleaning and loading the cannon. She was seriously wounded by grapeshot shortly before the Hessians overran the battery. Margaret was put on the rolls of the Invalid Regiment at West Point. She died in Highland Falls, New York, in 1800 at the age of 49. She is buried in the West Point post cemetery.Edward 1971, pp. 385‚Äì386. Another story about another ‚ÄúMolly‚Äù who distinguished herself on the battlefield has come down to us from the Battle of Monmouth, which was fought on a sweltering day in late June 1778. According to the legend of Molly Pitcher, Mary Hays, the wife of William Hays, a soldier in Proctor‚Äôs 4th Continental Artillery, was bringing pitchers of water from a nearby spring to the cannon crews when she saw her husband collapse. Mary is then reported to have picked up the rammer, joined the gun crew, and continued to work the cannon for the rest of the battle. It is further reported that for her heroism General Washington warranted her as a non-commissioned officer and awarded her a pension for life. There are eyewitness accounts that verify that Mary was present at the battle, that there was a woman bringing water to the cannon crews, and that a woman was seen assisting her husband at a gun. There is no record of any woman receiving a military title after the battle or any record of Mary receiving a federal pension (although she did receive a pension from the State of Pennsylvania for her war service, not her husband‚Äôs). Her contemporaries referred to Mary as ‚ÄúCaptain Molly‚Äù or ‚ÄúSergeant Molly,‚Äù not as ‚ÄúMolly Pitcher.‚Äù The name ‚ÄúMolly Pitcher‚Äù appeared in print for the first time in 1837 and was greatly popularized by the painting ‚ÄúMolly Pitcher: Heroine of Monmouth,‚Äù by Nathaniel Currier. William Hays survived the war, after which he and Mary settled in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. William died in 1789, after which Mary married another Revolutionary War veteran, George McCauley. She died in 1832, and is buried in Carlisle.Landis 1905, pp. 13‚Äì14. Beginning in 1784 and culminating in 1794, Proctor‚Äôs Artillery Battalion and the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion were consolidated to form the Regiment of Artillery of the City of Philadelphia, which was mustered into federal service during the War of 1812 as the Regiment of Artillery. Following extensive reorganization between the War of 1812 and World War I, the Regiment of Artillery of the City of Philadelphia became the 103rd Engineer Battalion on April 1, 1921. The shield of the Distinctive Unit Insignia is white to indicate early service as Infantry, whereas service as Infantry during the Civil War and World War I is indicated by the blue chevronelles, blue being the more recent color for Infantry. The red border signifies that the organization is now an Engineer unit. The ten stars represent ten battle honors in the Civil War, while the six fleur-de-lis represent World War I service. The red lion signifies service against the British in the War of 1812.  118th Field Artillery, GA ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 118th FA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Savannah, Georgia 1776, Florida 1778 The 118th Field Artillery traces its origins to four independent volunteer companies, three of foot and one of horse, in the Georgia Militia, District of Savannah, organized on April 18, 1751, following which they were mustered into service at Savannah under the command of Captain Noble Jones. These companies were reorganized as the 1st Regiment of Foot Militia, Division of Savannah, on April 2, 1757. ::::::* In January, 1776, the 1st Regiment of Foot Militia was reorganized to consist of two battalions, with elements from Savannah and Christ Church Parish in the 1st Battalion. The Regiment remained in state service, and did not spin off any units for adoption by the Continental Army. The regiment was disbanded on January 29, 1778, when Savannah surrendered to the British, but was reorganized in 1782 in the Georgia Militia as the 1st Regiment (Savannah and Chatham County in the 1st Battalion), 1st Brigade, 1st Division. In 1784 the 1st Battalion (Chatham Battalion), 1st Regiment, was expanded, reorganized and redesignated as the 1st Regiment (Chatham Regiment), 1st Brigade, 1st Division, which was reorganized in 1793 to consist of the 1st (or City) Battalion in Savannah and the 2nd (or County) Battalion in Chatham County. Then in 1807 the Chatham Regiment was reorganized wholly in Savannah. Several companies of the Chatham Regiment were mustered into service during the War of 1812. The Chatham Regiment became the 118th Field Artillery in 1917.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 118th Field Artillery. Major General (retired) Donald Burdick, who was Director of the Army National Guard from 1986 to 1991, served as commander of the 118th Field Artillery Brigade from 1981 to 1983. The scarlet color of the Distinctive Unit Insignia is for Artillery. The lion and fleur-de-lis represent service in the Revolutionary War and World War I, respectively, while the gray saltire represents Confederate service during the Civil War.  169th Military Police Company, RI ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 118th MP Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Rhode Island 1777, Rhode Island 1778 The 169th Military Police Company traces its roots back to the Artillery Company of Westerly and Charlestown, organized in January 1755. In May, 1758, the Artillery Company of Westerly and Charlestown was redesignated as the Artillery Company of Westerly, Charlestown and Hopkinton. During the Revolutionary War the company remained in state service, but was mustered into Continental service in 1777 and 1778, during which periods it earned credit for the Rhode Island 1777 and 1778 campaigns. In 1812 the Artillery Company was redesignated as the Washington Guards, which was mustered into federal service as Captain Coe‚Äôs Company of Wood‚Äôs State Corps in 1814. From the end of the War of 1812 until early in the twentieth century, the company served as Infantry. In 1908 Company E, 1st Rhode Island Infantry was converted into a Coast Artillery company. In 1953 it became an Antiaircraft Artillery battery, and in 1962 an Engineer company. It finally became the 169th Military Police Company in 1968. Since companies are not issued their own separate Distinctive Unit Insignia, soldiers in the 169th MP Company wear the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 118th MP Battalion, which is displayed above. At the present time the 169th MP Company is one of the two Military Police companies under the command of the 118th MP Battalion. The 169th MP Company, and its predecessor units, were based in Westerly, Rhode Island, until 1996 when it was re-located to Warren, Rhode Island. The ancestor units of the 169th MP Company served on active duty during the American Revolution, War of 1812, American Civil War, Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Operation Desert Storm. The 169th MP Company was deployed to Iraq from 2007 to 2008 and to Afghanistan from 2012 to 2013.  263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, SC ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 263rd ADA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Charleston, Savannah, South Carolina 1779 The 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command traces its roots to the Artillery Company of Charles Town, South Carolina Militia, which was organized in 1756 and chartered by the colony of South Carolina on July 31, 1760. In 1775 the regiment was expanded, reorganized and redesignated as the Charles Town Battalion of Artillery. ::::::* During the Revolutionary War the Charles Town Battalion of Artillery was active in the defense of Charleston and Savannah until May 12, 1780, when it surrendered to the British. The regiment was reconstituted in 1783 as the Charleston Battalion of Artillery, and organized at Charleston. On December 17, 1794, the Charleston Battalion of Artillery was attached to the 7th Brigade, 2nd Division, South Carolina Militia, and then expanded in 1797 to form the 1st Regiment of Artillery. One battalion of the 1st Regiment was mustered into federal service during the War of 1812. The unit remained an Artillery unit until 1890 when it became a battalion in the South Carolina Naval Militia, which was called into federal service during World War I for patrol duty with the United States Navy off the coast of South Carolina. By 1925 the unit had become the 263rd Coast Artillery Battalion, which, after many more organizational changes, became the 263rd Air Defense Artillery in 1959.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 263rd Air Defense Artillery. The red cross of St. George in the Distinctive Unit Insignia symbolizes Revolutionary War service, while the two cannons are trophies of the regiment.Stein 1993, p. 36. 133rd Engineer Battalion, ME ARNG Distinctive Unit Insignia: 133rd Eng Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Boston, Saratoga, Monmouth, New York 1777, Pennsylvania 1777, Massachusetts 1775, Massachusetts 1779 The 133rd Engineer Battalion traces its roots to the Cumberland County Regiment of the Massachusetts Militia which was formed in 1760. The regiment served during the American Revolution from April 1775 to January 1781, when it was variously known as Phinney's Regiment, the 18th Continental Regiment and the 12th Massachusetts Regiment. The 133rd Engineer Battalion was organized in 1970 from the 20th Armor Regiment, which was a descendant from several other units including the famed 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment which fought at the Battle of Gettysburg. The 133rd has 42 campaign streamers, representing service from the American Revolution to the War in Iraq. It has been awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. The 133rd uses the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 103rd Infantry Regiment, which is one of its several ancestor units.https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/eng/0133enbn.htm  296th Infantry, PR ARNG (Los Cocorocos)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 296th Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: None The 296th Infantry is an Army National Guard unit with Spanish colonial roots, rather than English ones. It became a unit in the American army after Puerto Rico became an American possession in the aftermath of the War with Spain. The 296th Infantry Regiment traces its history back to May 17, 1765, when Don Alejandro O‚ÄôReilly constituted the Milicias disciplinadas de la Isla de San Juan de Puerto Rico for the kingdom of Spain. The Milicias disciplinadas was organized on June 1, 1765, to consist of nineteen infantry and five cavalry companies. In 1898, when Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris ending the War with Spain, the island militia, by then known as the Battalon de voluntaries urbanos de Puerto Rico, was disbanded, only to be reconstituted on April 12, 1917, as an Infantry regiment in the Puerto Rico National Guard. This regiment was designated as the 1st Regiment of Infantry in 1919 and then as the 295th Infantry in 1923. On June 1, 1936, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 295th Infantry were withdrawn and redesignated as the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 296th Infantry.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 296th Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 429‚Äì430. There are some people associated with the Puerto Rico National Guard who believe that the lineage of the 296th Infantry Regiment should be extended much further back than 1765. Indeed, some claim that there is an unbroken connection between the 296th Infantry and the militias established on the island by Don Juan Ponce de Le√≥n in 1510. If the Center of Military History had accepted this claim, then it would have created a bit of a paradox: that the oldest unit in the United States Army would be one derived from a former colony of Spain, a country that was one of England‚Äôs, and subsequently America's, chief rivals for control of the New World, rather than one derived from the English militia in one of the original thirteen colonies. The event that caused the Center for Military History to reject such an interpretation was the comprehensive reorganization of the island‚Äôs militia implemented by Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly in 1765. Alejandro O'Reilly was born in Ireland, but spent much of his life as a mercenary in the Spanish army. After being sent to Puerto Rico by the Spanish King to prepare a comprehensive report on the defenses of San Juan, O'Reilly produced a \\"General Program of Military Reform\\", which included plans for both improving the island's fortifications and for revamping the local militias. For his efforts he became known as the \\"father of the Puerto Rico militia\\". This comprehensive reorganization of the island's militia was judged to constitute a definitive disconnection between the militia units that existed before the reorganization and those that were organized afterwards. The wavy base in the Distinctive Unit Insignia represents the sea, while the bastion with the sentry box represents the Infantry on the island of Puerto Rico. The blue color of the shield is also indicative of service as Infantry.Stein 1993, p. 181.  Troop A/1st Squadron/104th Cavalry, PA ARNG (First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 104th Cav Revolutionary War Campaigns: Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown The 104th Cavalry traces its lineage back only as far as 1874 when the 8th Infantry Regiment was constituted on June 30, 1874, and organized in south- central Pennsylvania on August 4, 1874. However, Troop A, 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry, can trace its origins all the way back to the Associators of the Light Horse of the City of Philadelphia, which was organized on November 17, 1774.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, Troop A/1st Squadron/104th Cavalry. Most of the members of the Philadelphia Light Horse were prominent members of many of Philadelphia‚Äôs elite social organizations, including the Schuylkill Fishing Company, the Schuylkill Company of Fort St. Davids, the St. Andrew‚Äôs Society of Philadelphia, the Society of Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, the Sons of St. George and the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club. Indeed, the short dark brown coats, faced and lined with white, and the ‚Äúround black hats bound with silver cord and buck‚Äôs tail‚Äù worn by the Troopers during the Revolutionary War were similar to the hunting coats and caps worn by club members during fox hunts.Pennsylvania National Guard 1985, pp. 2‚Äì4. The first notable action of the Associators of the Light Horse during the Revolutionary War was to escort General Washington from Philadelphia to Kingsbridge, New York, on his way to take command of the Continental Army outside of Boston in 1775. At other times the Troop was called upon to bear dispatches for the Committee of Safety and to march with money being delivered to the Army. * The unit served at various times during the Revolutionary War, earning credit for the Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine and Germantown campaigns. At the Battle of Trenton, the Troop crossed the Delaware with Washington and served as the rearguard as the Americans crossed back over the Delaware after the battle, while during the Battle of Princeton, it performed reconnaissance, participated in the counterattack against the British during the climax of the battle, and at the end of the battle served as a rearguard as Washington withdrew the Army to Morristown.Pennsylvania National Guard 1985, pp. 5, 8, 10. In 1794 the Light Horse of the City of Philadelphia was redesignated as the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry. In that same year the unit was called into service by President Washington to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion, an uprising of farmers in western Pennsylvania challenging the collection of a federal excise tax on whiskey. The Whiskey Rebellion was the first grassroots challenge to the authority of the new national government to enforce federal laws.Pennsylvania National Guard 1985, p. 34. The Troop was also mustered into federal service during the War of 1812, although they were not awarded any streamers for their service. Following the defeat of the American forces at Bladensburg, Maryland, and the subsequent occupation of Washington by the British, the Troop provided mounted sentinels to monitor the movements of British ships on Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River that might be heading for Philadelphia.Pennsylvania National Guard 1985, p. 43. Cavalry service is indicated in the Distinctive Unit Insignia by the horse's head and by the yellow in the shield; Infantry service, by the blue band. The black Maltese cross represents service in Puerto Rico, while the red keystone is the insignia of the 28th Infantry Division, in which elements of the regiment have served.  175th Infantry, MD ARNG (Fifth Maryland)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 175th Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Yorktown, Cowpens, Guilford Court House, New York 1776, New York 1777, South Carolina 1780, South Carolina 1781, South Carolina 1782, North Carolina 1781 The 175th Infantry had its origins in the Baltimore Independent Cadets, a company of sixty ‚Äúgentlemen of honour, family, and fortune,‚Äù organized on December 3, 1774. On 14 January 1776 the Baltimore Independent Cadets were absorbed into William Smallwood‚Äôs Maryland Battalion (or Regiment) and seven attached independent companies.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 175th Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1982, pp. 343‚Äì345. ::::::* After being adopted by the Continental Army in August 1776, Smallwood‚Äôs Maryland Battalion was expanded and reorganized as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Maryland Regiments. These seven regiments underwent reorganization in 1781 to form the 1st‚Äì5th Maryland Regiments, in 1782 to form the 1st‚Äì4th Maryland Regiments, and in 1783 to form the 1st and 2nd Maryland Regiments. Smallwood's Maryland Continental troops distinguished themselves during the Battles of Long Island and White Plains.Boatner 1974, p. 1013. In 1794 during a reorganization of the Maryland Militia, the volunteer militia companies of Baltimore were organized as elements of the 5th Regiment of Militia, later designated as the 5th Regiment of Volunteer Infantry. The regiment was mustered into federal service during the War of 1812. On 1 January 1, 1941, the 5th Regiment of Infantry was redesignated as the 175th Infantry. The Distinctive Unit Insignia has the design of the Crossland Arms, Alicia Crossland having been the mother of George Calvert, the first Baron of Baltimore. The ‚Äú5‚Äù refers to the regiment‚Äôs designation as the 5th Regiment of Militia in 1794. The red color of the annulet is symbolic of the red uniforms of the Baltimore Independent Cadets, while the gray field represents Confederate service during the Civil War.  109th Field Artillery, PA ARNG (Wyoming Valley Guards)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 109th FA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Brandywine, Germantown, New Jersey 1777, Pennsylvania 1777, Pennsylvania 1778, Pennsylvania 1779, New York 1779 The 109th Field Artillery traces its origins to the 24th Regiment, Connecticut Militia, constituted on May 11, 1775, and organized on October 17, 1775, in the Wyoming River Valley, a twenty-five-mile stretch along the North Branch of the Susquehanna River in an area of present-day Pennsylvania that was claimed by Connecticut in 1775.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 109th Field Artillery. King Charles II had granted the land to Connecticut in 1663, but also to William Penn in 1681. Contention over which colony held title to the Wyoming Valley led to an outbreak of armed skirmishes, referred to as the First Yankee- Pennamite War, in 1769. Supporters of Pennsylvania‚Äôs claims were called Pennamites. In December, 1775, personnel from the 24th Regiment, Connecticut Militia, participated in one such skirmish against some Pennamites at Rampart Rocks. During the Revolutionary War, an uneasy truce prevailed between the two groups of settlers. In 1782 the Wyoming Valley was awarded to Pennsylvania, rekindling the animosity, and triggered some fighting (the Second Yankee- Pennamite War) between the pro-Connecticut and pro-Pennsylvania factions. This dispute was not fully resolved until 1799, when the Pennsylvania legislature settled the land claims of the Connecticut claimants. * During the Revolutionary War the 24th Regiment, Connecticut Militia, earned credit for the Pennsylvania Campaigns of 1777, 1778 and 1779, in addition to campaigns with the Main Army in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania campaigns involved a number of actions in the Wyoming Valley against the Iroquois, who were allies of the British and Tory Loyalists. The Wyoming Valley was an important source of grain and other agricultural products for the Continental Army. The 24th Regiment was present at the Battle of Wyoming on July 3, 1778. In this encounter a force of approximately seven hundred Iroquois, British Regulars and Tory Rangers from Fort Niagara attacked and defeated a smaller militia force at a location south of present-day Scranton. Between three and four hundred American militiamen and settlers were killed in the battle and the massacre that followed. Following the surrender of the American forces the Indians continued to terrorize the Valley, resulting in its near complete abandonment by mid-July. During the summer of 1779, an American expedition that included the 24th Regiment, Connecticut Militia, successfully drove the Indians out of the Valley. On November 13, 1787, the militia units in the region were redesignated as Hollenbeck‚Äôs Battalion, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania Militia. In 1793 Hollenbeck‚Äôs Battalion was redesignated as the 3rd Regiment, Luzerne County, which, in 1799, was redesignated as the 35th Regiment. After numerous reorganizations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Wyoming Valley Guards became the 109th Field Artillery in 1917. The Distinctive Unit Insignia, in the shape of an arrowhead, commemorates service in conflicts with the Indians.  Company A/1st Battalion/69th Infantry, NY ARNG (Fighting 69th)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 69th Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Quebec The 69th Infantry traces its lineage back to December 21, 1849, when the 1st Irish Regiment was formed in New York from new and existing companies composed of Irish immigrants. However, Company A, 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry, can trace its origins all the way back to the 8th Company, 1st New York Regiment, which was authorized on May 25, 1775, and organized June 28‚ÄìAugust 4, 1775, in New York City.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 69th Infantry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 328‚Äì329. ::::::* During the Revolutionary War the 1st New York Regiment participated in the unsuccessful invasion of Canada, an offensive undertaken with the goal of driving the English out of Quebec and inducing Francophone Canada to join the American rebellion against Great Britain. Between 1776 and 1858 the 8th Company, 1st New York Regiment, underwent numerous reorganizations, with its lineage passing in 1786 to Captain Van Wagenen‚Äôs Company, 3d Regiment of Infantry, in 1800 to the 6th Company, 6th Regiment of Infantry, and on January 22, 1858, to Company B, 9th Regiment. The 9th Regiment had been created in 1850 by the redesignation of the 1st Irish Regiment. In May, 1858, the 9th Regiment was consolidated with the 69th Regiment (organized October 12, 1851, in New York as the 2nd Irish Regiment), with the new regiment retaining the designation as the 69th Regiment. Civil War service is indicated in the Distinctive Unit Insignia by the red trefoil, which was the insignia of the 1st Division, 2nd Corps, in which the regiment served. The rainbow is the insignia of the 42nd Division, indicating service in that division in France during World War I. The black ‚Äú69‚Äù on an oval shield supported by two Irish wolfhounds has been a symbol of the regiment since its founding. The green of the shield is the old facing color of the regiment.  HD/1109th Aviation Group, CT ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 1109th Avn Gp Revolutionary War Campaigns: New York 1776, Rhode Island 1777, Connecticut 1781 The Headquarters Detachment, 1109th Aviation Group traces its lineage back to the Norwich Light Infantry, Connecticut Militia, organized in May 1775 as an element of the 20th Regiment and commanded by Captain Christopher Leffingwell. ::::::* The Norwich Light Infantry was part of the Main Army that fought unsuccessfully for the control of New York City in 1776. Thereafter it served in Rhode Island and Connecticut. In 1847 the Norwich Light Infantry was converted to Artillery Company A, 3rd Regiment, Connecticut Volunteer Militia, and mustered into federal service during the Civil war as Company C, 3rd Connecticut Volunteer Infantry. After service during the first half of the twentieth century as a Coast Artillery, Field Artillery or Antiaircraft Artillery unit, it became Company B, 162nd Transportation Battalion in 1959. By 1979, after a series of additional reorganizations, the 162nd Transportation had become the Headquarters Detachment, 1109th Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot (AVCRAD). In 2007 the Headquarters Detachment, 1109th AVCRAD was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters Detachment, 1109th Aviation Group.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 192nd Engineer Battalion; and personal communication, Mr. Joseph Seymour, National Guard Historian, Center of Military History.

Battery C/3rd Battalion/197th Field Artillery, NH ARNG (Stratford Guards, Dover)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 197th FA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Boston The 197th Field Artillery traces its lineage back only to April‚ÄìOctober 1861 when the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry Regiments were organized from existing volunteer militia companies and mustered into federal service in the Civil War. However, Battery C, 1st Battalion, 197 Field Artillery, can trace its origin all the way back to Captain Waldron‚Äôs Minute Company, 2nd New Hampshire Regiment, which was organized on July 3, 1775. ::::::* The 2nd New Hampshire Regiment was mustered into service with the New England Army in December 1775 and earned credit for the Boston campaign. Following its service in Boston, Captain Waldron‚Äôs Company resumed its status as a company in the 2nd Regiment, New Hampshire Militia. Between 1776 and 1917 the New Hampshire Militia underwent numerous redesignations, leading ultimately to the formation of the 172nd Field Artillery, with headquarters in Manchester, and the 197th Artillery (Coast Artillery), with headquarters in Concord. After still more reorganizations, the 197th Artillery (Coast Artillery) became the 197th Field Artillery in 1972. During all of these reorganizations the lineage of Captain Waldron's Minute Company was perpetuated by Battery C, 1st Battalion, 172nd Field Artillery. But in September 2008, the 172nd and 197th Field Artillery Regiments were consolidated, with the resulting unit designated as the 197th Field Artillery. During this consolidation Battery C, 1st Battalion, 172nd Field Artillery, was consolidated with Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 197th Field Artillery, so today the lineage of Captain Waldron's Company resides in Battery, 3rd Battalion, 197th Field Artillery.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 172nd Field Artillery and 197th Field Artillery.

The shield of the Distinctive Unit Insignia is blue to indicate the early service of the unit as Infantry. The gold lion is for service in the War of 1812; the white lozenge‚Äìthe corps badge for the 2nd Division, 3rd Corps, during the Civil War‚Äìrepresents Civil War service; and the fleur-de-lis, service during World War I. The chief is red for Artillery and the winged projectile indicates service as an Antiaircraft Artillery unit.  HHD/104th Military Police Battalion, NY ARNG (Poughkeepsie Invincibles) =1156th Engineer Company (Vertical), NYARNG (First New York)= Distinctive Unit Insignia: 104th MP Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: New York 1776, New York 1777 The Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 104th Military Police Battalion, was formed on September 1, 2004, by the consolidation of three batteries from the 1st Battalion, 156th Field Artillery‚Äìthe Headquarters Battery, Battery A and Battery B‚Äìtwo of which trace their origins to units formed during the American Revolution. The 1156th Engineer Company was co- created by consolidating one battery - Headquarters - of the 1/156 FA and Charlie Company of the 204th Engineer Battalion. Headquarters Battery out of Kingston, NY traces its lineage back a hundred years before the Revolutionary War. Battery A, 1st Battalion, 156th Field Artillery, traces its origins to Captain Jacobus Frear's Company (Poughkeepsie Invincibles), 4th Regiment, Duchess County Militia, organized October 17, 1775, in Poughkeepsie, while the Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion traces its lineage to Captain Hendrick Schoonmaker's Company, Ulster County Militia, Colonel Johannes Snyder's 1st Regiment, organized in the New York Militia in Kingston.A 1946 156th Field Artillery History reports Schoonmaker's Company origan to the 1658 Rondout Militia Battery B is more recent, tracing its history to the Service Battery, 1st Battalion, 156th Field Artillery organized in 1941. ::::::* Colonel Snyder's 1st Regiment was mustered into service in late 1776, and was also present at the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery in the highlands of the Hudson River Valley in 1777. Captain Freer's Company was redesignated as the 4th Company, Colonel John Freer's Regiment, in 1786, and as 4th Company, 84th Regiment of Infantry, in 1812. The Poughkeepsie Invincible eventually became Battery A, 1st Battalion, 156th Field Artillery, in 1972. Captain Schoonmaker's Company was redesignated as a company in Colonel Jacob Bruyn's Regiment, Ulster County Militia, in 1786, and as the 131st Regiment in 1812. Schoonmaker's Company eventually became the Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 156th Field Artillery, in 1986. The red portion of the Distinctive Unit Insignia represents the unit‚Äôs role as a Field Artillery battalion during World War II and the Global War on Terrorism, while the green portion of the shield represents its current status as a Military Police unit. The taro leaf represents Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service in Hawaii, while the fleur-de-lis is for World War I and II service in France. The black silhouette of the Twin Towers honors the unit‚Äôs service members that served in the towers at the time of the September 11 attack, and also those battalion members deployed to New York City to perform security at the site. This is the first Distinctive Unit Insignia to incorporate symbolism representing a role in the response to the attack on the Trade Center. The red cross of St. George and the blue saltire in the canton represent the Revolutionary War and Civil War service of the two batteries that go back to the colonial era. The Distinctive Unit Insignia is a modification of the insignia of the 156th Field Artillery.  113th Infantry, NJ ARNG (First New Jersey)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 113th Inf Revolutionary War Campaigns: Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Yorktown, Canada 1776, New York 1776, New York 1777, New York 1779, New Jersey 1777, New Jersey 1780 There are claims that the lineage of the 113th Infantry goes all the way back to militia elements from northern New Jersey (Essex, Hudson, Bergen, and Passaic counties) that existed in 1664, and that these elements were organized into the First New Jersey Regiment in 1673,Military.com Unit Pages, 2nd Battalion, 113th Infantry, http://www.military.com/HomePageUnitPageHistory/1,305%06903,00html. but this claim is not accepted by the Center of Military History, which is the final arbiter in conflicting lineage claims. According to the Lineage and Honors issued in 2000 by the Center of Military History, the 113th Infantry traces its lineage back to the 1st New Jersey Regiment, organized in the Continental Army during the period October 26‚ÄìDecember 15, 1775, from existing militia units in Essex County.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 113th Infantry (First New Jersey), 2000. ::::::* The 1st New Jersey Regiment was initially assigned in April 1776 to Stirling's Brigade, an element in the Main Army, and then almost immediately reassigned to the Canadian Department. In July 1776 it was transferred to Stark's Brigade, and subsequently St. Clair's Brigade, in the Northern Department. In late 1776 it returned to the Main Army, being assigned to the New Jersey Brigade in May 1777.Wright 1983, p. 255. In 1783 the 1st New Jersey Regiment was redesignated as the New Jersey Regiment. Following the war the regiment was disbanded, but was reconstituted in 1793 as the Essex Brigade, elements of which were mustered into federal service during the War of 1812. After numerous reorganizations over the next hundred years, the First New Jersey became the 113th Infantry in 1921. The settlement of New Jersey by the English and Dutch is commemorated in the Distinctive Unit Insignia by the lion, which is from the coats of arms of both England and Holland, and by the set of four red lozenges, which is from the coat of arms of the English Proprietors. Proprietors were favorites of the Crown who were granted large tracts of land in the New World to supervise and develop. The white saltire represents service of the 1st Regiment, New Jersey Brigade, in the Civil War. The oak tree represents service in World War I.Stein 1993, p. 170.  Company A/1st Battalion/19th Special Forces Group, RI ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 1st Special Forces Regiment Revolutionary War Campaigns: Rhode Island 1777, Rhode Island 1778 Company A, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces, traces its lineage back to the North Providence Rangers, organized and chartered on December 5, 1775, in North Providence and Smithfield. During the Revolutionary War, the North Providence Rangers remained in state service as a militia unit, but additionally formed the 2nd Company (Captain Gideon Westcott commanding), Rhode Island State Artillery Regiment. ::::::* The 2nd Company, Rhode Island State Artillery Regiment was mustered into state service on December 23, 1776, at Providence and disbanded on June 1, 1780. The North Providence Rangers were also mustered into state service during the War of 1812 as Captain John Wood‚Äôs Company, Wood‚Äôs State Corps, at Fort Adams, Rhode Island. In 1824 the North Providence Rangers were rechartered as the Fayette Rifle Corps, and in 1857 as the Pawtucket Light Guard. After service as Infantry during most of the nineteenth century, and as Coast Artillery or Antiaircraft Artillery during the first half of the twentieth century, the North Providence Rangers became a Special Forces company in 1962. It became Company A, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group, in 1979.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, Company A, 2nd Battalion, 19th Special Forces. Company A's armory is currently located in Middletown, Rhode Island. All Special Forces soldiers wear the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 1st Special Forces Regiment. The insignia combines the crest and shield of the 1st Special Service Force of World War II, which was activated in 1942 at Fort Harrison, Montana, and disbanded in France in 1945, then reconstituted again in 1960 as the 1st Special Forces Regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System.  198th Signal Battalion, DE ARNG (First Delaware)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 198th Sig Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Yorktown, Cowpens, Guilford Court House, New York 1776, New York 1777, South Carolina 1780, South Carolina 1781, South Carolina 1782, North Carolina 1781 The 198th Signal Battalion has descended from the Delaware Regiment, constituted in the Continental Army on December 9, 1775, and organized during January‚ÄìMarch 1776 as Colonel John Haslet‚Äôs Regiment. ::::::* The regiment was reorganized as Colonel David Hall‚Äôs Regiment between December 12, 1776, and March 1, 1777. Its most noteworthy action was at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781, where a British force of 1,100 Regulars suffered over 800 casualties in a battle against 300 Continentals and 700 militia from North and South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia. Following the Revolutionary War, the companies of the Delaware Regiment were reorganized as the Light Infantry, 1st Regiment, the Artillery Company, 2nd Brigade, and the 1st Company, Light Infantry, 8th Regiment, all three of which were mustered into service for the War of 1812. For the rest of the eighteenth century and until the end of World War I in the twentieth century, the 1st Delaware served primarily as Infantry. Following World War I it became a Coast Artillery unit; during World War II and for a while thereafter, an Antiaircraft Artillery unit; and finally in 1970 it was reorganized as the 198th Signal Battalion.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 198th Signal Battalion. The shield of the Distinctive Unit Insignia is white, the old color of Infantry. The eleven mullets represent the eleven battles and campaigns in which the organization served during the Civil War, and the red fleur-de-lis is for World War I service. Red is also the color of the Coast Artillery. The Distinctive Unit Insignia was originally approved for the 198th Coast Artillery and later redesignated for the 736th Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion. It became the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 198th Signal Battalion on October 19, 1978.  1st Battalion/5th Field Artillery, US Army (Alexander Hamilton Battery)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 5th FA Revolutionary War Campaigns: Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Yorktown, New York 1776, New Jersey 1776, New Jersey 1777, New Jersey 1780 Although the 5th Field Artillery can only claim roots that go back to 1907 when the regiment was constituted from new and existing units at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery, traces its roots to the New York Provincial Company of Artillery, constituted January 6, 1776, and commanded by Captain Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton was twenty-one years old at the time. The company was organized in February‚ÄìMarch 1776 in New York City. The 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery, is the oldest unit in the active United States Army and the only one to have credit for participation in the Revolutionary War. ::::::* A year later, in March 1777, Hamilton's Company was transferred to the Continental Army as Captain John Doughty‚Äôs Company, Colonel John Lamb‚Äôs (New York) Continental Artillery Regiment. It was reorganized and redesignated in 1779 as the 2nd Company, 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment. On July 12, 1776, a battery of the New York Provincial Company of Artillery at Fort George at the southern tip of Manhattan Island is believed to have fired the first artillery rounds following the signing and first publication of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, when it fired on two British ships entering New York Harbor and sailing up the North River.McCullough 2005, p. 138. The location of this event has been known as ‚ÄúThe Battery‚Äù ever since. The 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery, also claims the honor of having fired the last rounds of the Revolutionary War when Captain Doughty‚Äôs Company fired a 13-gun salute from the same location at the tip of Manhattan as the British withdrew from Fort George, and the American flag was raised over the fort.Hamilton 1984, pp.30-32. Hamilton's Battery played a particularly significant role in the Long Island campaign, when it covered the successful withdrawal of Washington‚Äôs army across the East River to Brooklyn Heights. Hamilton‚Äôs Battery was also in the force that crossed the Delaware River on the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776 to launch a surprise attack on British forces near Trenton, an action that resulted in the capture of an entire regiment of Hessians and gave the Americans their first significant victory in the war following a series of defeats in the Battles of Brooklyn, Kips Bay, White Plains, Fort Washington and Fort Lee, broken only by the victory at Harlem Heights, and during the discouraging retreat across New Jersey. The 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery, is not only the oldest unit in the active US Army, but there was also a short period of time when its precursor, Captain Doughty‚Äôs Company, was the only unit in the US Army. The Revolutionary War had hardly ended before a strong sentiment grew against the maintenance of a permanent professional peacetime army, and in 1784 Congress instructed President Washington to ‚Äúdischarge the troops now in the service of the United States, except twenty-five privates to guard the stores at Fort Pitt and fifty-five to guard the stores at West Point and other magazines.‚Äù The fifty- five artillerists at West Point were the remnants of Captain Doughty‚Äôs Company and were still commanded by Brevet Major Doughty, so until the First American Regiment was organized in 1785, Doughty‚Äôs Company of Artillery was the only officially constituted and organized formation in the United States Army. In July 1785 Captain Doughty‚Äôs Company became the 1st Company, Artillery, 1st American Regiment. The next action of the 1st Company of Artillery was in the Miami Campaign (1790‚Äì1795), an Indian War that was an addendum to the American Revolution. Neither the Revolutionary War nor the Treaty of Paris that ended the war dealt with the contentious issue of American expansion into the Old Northwest (the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin). American expansion was fiercely resisted by Native tribes, which were encouraged and supported by the British, and in 1790 President Washington sent an American expedition into the Northwest to establish American military dominance in the area. The expedition was a disastrous failure. On November 4, 1791, a force under the command of Major General Arthur St. Clair, which included the 1st Company of Artillery, encamped near the headwaters of the Wabash River in the Northwest Territory, near the location of present-day Fort Recovery, Ohio, and was virtually destroyed by a force of Indians led by Little Turtle, Blue Jacket and Tecumseh.Lytle 2004, pp. 87‚Äì108. Of the 1,669 soldiers in St. Clair's army, 871 were killed or wounded, a casualty rate of over fifty percent.Gaff 2004, p. 9. It is believed that the Indians lost fewer than a hundred.Lytle 2004, p. 109. Following the battle, the remnants of the 1st Company, Battalion of Artillery. were consolidated with another battery and redesignated as Captain Mahlon Ford‚Äôs Company of Artillery of the 1st Sublegion, Legion of the United States, and placed under the command of Brigadier General Anthony Wayne. In 1793 Wayne led a force back into the area to reassert American power. The culminating action of this campaign occurred on August 10, 1794, at the Battle of Fallen Timbers at a location south of present-day Toledo. The battle resulted in a resounding victory for Wayne‚Äôs forces. In the Treaty of Greenville that ended the Northwest Indian War, signed in August 1795, the Indian tribes ceded to the United States much of what is today the State of Ohio, plus the future site of Chicago and the area around Fort Detroit. The Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 5th Field Artillery is the crest of the Hamilton family.  131st Military Police Company, SC ARNG  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 51st MP Bn Revolutionary War Campaigns: Charleston, Savannah, South Carolina 1779 The 131st Military Police Company traces its lineage back to the Beaufort Independent Company of Artillery, formed on February 11, 1776.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 131st Military Police Company. ::::::* This company earned Revolutionary War credit while serving in the 4th South Carolina Artillery Regiment. It was present at the Battle of Beaufort, the defense of Savannah and the Siege of Charleston. It was forced to surrender in 1780 when the British captured Charleston. For the next hundred years the Beaufort Independent Company was an Artillery unit in the South Carolina Militia. In 1878 it was reorganized as Naval Militia, and served through World War I by providing replacement personnel for the Navy. In 1921 it became part of the 263rd Coast Artillery (see 263rd Air Defense Artillery above) and remained a Coast Artillery unit until 1949. From 1949 until 1971 it underwent numerous reorganizations and redesignations, finally becoming Troop B, 196th Cavalry, in 1971 and Troop B, 202nd Cavalry, in 1991. In September 2008, Troop B, 202nd Cavalry, was reorganized and redesignated as the 131st Military Police Company. Since Distinctive Unit Insignia are not issued to companies, soldiers in the 131st Military Police Company wear the insignia of the higher echelon unit in which it serves, which is the 51st Military Police Battalion.  150th Cavalry, WV ARNG (Second West Virginia)  Distinctive Unit Insignia: 150th Cav Revolutionary War Campaigns: Streamer without inscription The 150th Cavalry traces its origins to the Militia of Greenbrier County, Virginia, constituted on March 1, 1778. The Greenbrier County Militia included minuteman companies organized in 1777 for frontier defense in western Virginia. ::::::* In addition, the Greenbrier County Militia provided drafts for Virginia regiments of the Continental Army during the period 1778‚Äì1782. In the decade following the Revolutionary War, there were a number of conflicts between settlers from Virginia moving into areas west of the Appalachians in what is now Kentucky and Native American tribes resisting American westward expansion. Three companies from the Greenbrier Militia were involved in these conflicts: Captain William Clendennin's Ranger Company (in state service during 1788), Captain John Morris's Ranger Company (mustered into federal service, May 1‚ÄìSeptember 30, 1791, and March 15, 1792‚ÄìJanuary 1, 1793), and Captain John Caperton's Ranger Company (in state service during 1793). The Greenbrier Militia was reorganized as volunteer companies in the 13th Brigade, Virginia Militia, on December 22, 1792. After many reorganizations during the nineteenth century, the Greenbrier Militia was reorganized in 1889 as companies in the 2nd Regiment, West Virginia National Guard, which became the 2nd Infantry Regiment, West Virginia National Guard, in 1899. In 1917, it became the 150th Infantry, and the 150th Cavalry in 2005.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 150th Cavalry. Reproduced in Sawicki 1981, pp. 291‚Äì292. The powder horn in the Distinctive Unit Insignia is from the coat of arms of the State of West Virginia. The five stars represent five wars in which the regiment has participated, but there has been some confusion concerning which five wars these stars should represent. When the Distinctive Unit Insignia was first issued in 1934, the regiment was credited with participation in the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War and World War I. But in 1950 credit for participation in the Mexican War was withdrawn. However, by 1950 the 150th Infantry had been awarded credit for service in the American Theater during World War II and, therefore, was still entitled to credit for participation in five wars, thus precluding any need to issue a redesigned Distinctive Unit Insignia.

It has been credited as replacing another building on the same site, although no evidence of this has been found. It was built or improved by the ironmaster William Rea, a former Mayor of Monmouth, around 1720. The windows were replaced and a new entrance doorway was added around 1800, probably by ironmaster David Tanner. Chapel House was restored in 1910 by Humphrey Farran Hall who repaired the panelling.

His episcopal consecration, at the hands of Federico Tedeschini, the Papal Nuncio, was celebrated in Madrid on 27 October. He was the first Salesian bishop of Spain. On 18 February 1946 he was translated to the Archbishop's see of Valencia and he died there on 21 October 1972. Spanish Civil War Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, across the whole of the part of Spain which called itself 'National', the bishops sought to keep control of the priests that had gone as volunteers with the columns or militias, placing themselves at the orders of the military chiefs.

No! Hold back! the blood of our son is blood that redeems us; we can hear his voice, like the voice of Jesus on the cross 'forgive!' Let no one be touched because of our son ! Let no one suffer! Let all be forgiven! If you wreak vengeance now, he would curse you, I and my son would curse you'. \\" In the villages and towns people knew who had voted for which party - known leftists were at risk when the funeral of a volunteer was announced. If a person simply had rarely gone to Mass, or practised the sacraments, he was at risk. Olaechea noted the 'souls' who had come flocking to the Church that hadn't come before; - \\" they bring fear with them as well, piercing the soul like a dagger. And we have to win them over with the sincerity of our faith, with the sincerity of our love, with social justice and with charity.\\" In the rebel zone, a life could depend on the testimony of a parish priest concerning the religious practice of the accused. In many localities all that was needed for a person to be shot was for the priest to declare that before the war the accused did not go to Mass. At a different level, the removal of schoolteachers could also depend on the testimonies of parish priests.Raguer, p.157  References  Bibliography *Raguer Su√±er, Hilario M.

It used the Progress 7K-TG configuration, and was the third Progress mission to Salyut 6. It carried supplies for the EO-2 crew aboard Salyut 6, as well as equipment for conducting scientific research, and fuel for adjusting the station's orbit and performing manoeuvres. Spacecraft Progress 3 was a Progress 7K-TG spacecraft. The third of forty three to be launched, it had the serial number 103. The Progress 7K-TG spacecraft was the first generation Progress, derived from the Soyuz 7K-T and intended for unmanned logistics missions to space stations in support of the Salyut programme. On some missions the spacecraft were also used to adjust the orbit of the space station. The Progress spacecraft had a dry mass of , which increased to around when fully fuelled. It measured in length, and in diameter. Each spacecraft could accommodate up to of payload, consisting of dry cargo and propellant. The spacecraft were powered by chemical batteries, and could operate in free flight for up to three days, remaining docked to the station for up to thirty. Launch and docking Progress 3 was launched at 22:31:22 UTC on 7 August 1978, atop a Soyuz-U 11A511U carrier rocket flying from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The rocket that launched it had the serial number Ye15000-138. Following launch, Progress 3 was given the COSPAR designation 1978-077A, whilst NORAD assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 10999. Following launch, Progress 3 began two days of free flight. It subsequently docked with the aft port of the Salyut 6 space station at 23:59:30 UTC on 9 August 1978. At the time of its docking, Soyuz 29 was docked to the forward port of the station. Mission Progress 3 was the third of twelve Progress spacecraft used to supply the Salyut 6 space station between 1978 and 1981. It delivered cargo to the station, including food, fur boots, and Kovalyonok's guitar. Whilst Progress 3 was docked, Salyut 6 was manned by the EO-2 crew, consisting of cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov. On 9 August 1978, whilst docked to Salyut 6, Progress 3 was catalogued in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of , inclined at 51.66¬∞ and with a period of 88.7 minutes. Progress 3 undocked from Salyut 6 at 15:42:50 UTC on 21 August 1978. It remained in orbit until the late afternoon of 23 August 1978, when it was deorbited. The deorbit burn occurred at 16:45:00 UTC, with the spacecraft undergoing a destructive reentry at around 17:30 UTC. Less than a few weeks after Progress 3 had been deorbited, Progress 4 was launched to replace it.

In addition to imaginations, lines include real-life disasters, including JFK assassination and bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The song title is sung six times, matching with 'blood scum'.Soulfly - World Scum Lyrics  Music video  A man dreams about hunting down frogs and dissecting it while serving time in prison. His dream begins when another man sorts pills into separate petri dishes and starts dissecting a frog to analyze its interior, while he hunts down frogs through the window using the sniper rifle. Then he goes out to bring more frogs in for dissection but he gets attacked by a slaver armed with an ax, dismembering his lower right leg. Snakes would start eating tissues where his leg was cut as a flock of sheep roam by. Then the man in lab apron went to check on him and found that he's brutally beaten, and confronted the ax man about the attack. The attacker swings an ax onto him one more time to make him perish. And then like the first scene of this music video, the final scene shows the same man sitting in the cell after his nightmarish dream is over. The video also shows what appears to be Jesus Christ being tempted by Satan.

Preliminary construction began in 2002 and major works started in May 2011. The first unit of the power station was commissioned in 2017, the power station will have an installed capacity of 1,500 MW. As a pumped-storage scheme, the power station shifts water between an upper and a lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, when electricity is cheap, the power plant can pump water from the lower reservoir to the upper. When energy demand is high, water is released back down to the power station to produce electricity. The power station will contain six 250 MW reversible Francis pump-turbines which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper reservoir will be formed by a tall concrete-face rock-fill dam and withhold of water. Of that capacity, is active (or usable) storage for power generation. The lower reservoir will be formed adjacent to the Shahe Reservoir with a series of dikes. The power station will generation an estimated 2.007 billion kWh annually and consume 2.676 billion kWh when pumping. Although the power station will consume more energy than it will produce, it is economical because pumping occurs when electricity is cheaper.

Vibe rock has been identified as a response to the often \\"disempowering story telling and violent messages\\" that is prevalent in today's modern popular music. Vibe Rock is a musical movement that holds the belief that we can all get along, communicate, respect and harmonize with one another. A movement that allows a space for both light and dark to come together in the middle to Rock with a smile, dance with abandon and release the human spirit authentically. Because both light and dark forces want to feel strong and vibrant. Vibe Rock is that meeting place for both sides (light and dark forces) to engage in life-affirming music that helps foster strength and vibrancy. The ultimate goal of the Vibe Rock movement is to increase the awareness that we are all truly one voice of the Universe, a chorus of high and low voices that are equally important to the song, just as the dark and light colors are necessary for the painting upon the canvas to become a masterpiece.

The series is based on the Danish television series Forbrydelsen (The Crime) and developed for American audiences by Veena Sud. The episode's teleplay was written by Sud and was directed by Patty Jenkins. In the episode, police detective Sarah Linden plans to retire but is asked to investigate the disappearance of Rosie Larsen, a young girl. Plot Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) takes her morning jog along a park's jogging path. Her scenes are inter- cut with a night-time flashback of a teenage girl (Katie Findlay) frantically racing through the woods. The girl is being chased by someone with a flashlight and they find her. The morning jog is cut short when Sarah receives a phone call. She rushes to a crime scene, where a bloody trail leads her to a surprise going-away party thrown by co-workers. It is Sarah's last day as a Seattle, Washington homicide detective. At the police station, Sarah packs her personal items and meets her replacement, Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman). Her boss, Lieutenant Oakes (Garry Chalk), gives her one last assignment, assuring it will be her last, and tells her to bring along Holder. On the way to the crime scene, Holder relates his previous work as a narc for the county police. At the crime scene, they are shown what evidence that has been discovered thus far: a bloody pink sweater and Stanley Larsen's ATM card. No body has been found, so Sarah decides that the sex crimes unit should instead be investigating. Holder argues that the Larsen name should be checked out, promising Linden that they'll be done in time for her to catch her flight. Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) stops by his home while working to fix a dishwasher that is constantly breaking. His wife, Mitch (Michelle Forbes), again mentions their daughter Rosie's plans to attend college out of state. The mother is for the idea, the father against it. Sarah and Holder later arrive at the Larsen home, where Mitch says that she and her husband spent the weekend camping out of cell-phone range. After noticing a pink bicycle in their garage, Sarah asks Mitch if she has a daughter. Mitch tells Sarah and Holder that Rosie went to a Halloween dance on Friday. Rosie had told her that \\"only freshmen wore costumes\\" and wore a pink sweater. After taking a call from the school, Mitch learns that Rosie wasn't with her best friend, Sterling (Kacey Rohl), over the weekend and hasn't been seen since the dance. While Mitch is on the phone, Sarah peeks into Rosie's room, which is decorated with a butterfly theme. Meanwhile, Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell), a Seattle city councilman and mayoral candidate, visits an outdoor mausoleum. Later, upon arriving at City Hall, he announces to campaign manager Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) and lead advisor Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman) that Councilwoman Ruth Yitanes will endorse him, which could seal an election victory. At Fort Washington High, Richmond and his rival, mayor Lesley Adams (Tom Butler), are about to address a student assembly. Sarah arrives and suggests canceling the assembly, to allow the police to investigate Rosie's disappearance. Richmond agrees, angering Adams. At campaign headquarters, Jamie urges Richmond to take advantage of Rosie's disappearance, but the candidate refuses to cooperate. After hearing that Adams knew about Yitanes' endorsement, Richmond asks Jamie and Gwen if a staff member is leaking information. Not long after, he receives a phone call regarding a reporter's inquiries into a rendezvous that only few people on his staff know about. At their apartment, Stan asks Mitch about Jasper Ames, who has been involved with Rosie. Mitch tells him that Jasper and Rosie had broken up. Stan later confronts Sterling, who tells him that Rosie is with Jasper. Stan calls Mitch with the news. Oakes calls Sarah to tell her that Rosie has been found at Jasper's and halts the investigation. Sarah is skeptical, since no one has spoken directly to Rosie, and stays at the crime scene. However, the reported burial site uncovers only a doll and she leaves the site. While preparing to leave the crime scene, Sarah sees three people with fishing poles walking along a fire road and wonders where they're headed. Holder offers a map showing a lake nearby. As night falls, a crane hoists a black car out of the lake. Stan bursts into the Ames' weekend home. Jasper (Richard Harmon) protests, but Stan charges into the bedroom, only to find a middle-aged woman (Leanna Merrett) in the bed. Stan calls Mitch to tell her that Rosie wasn't at Jasper's house and that he's now heading to Discovery Park, where the pink sweater was found. With Mitch still on the phone, he approaches two police vehicles blocking the road. He's too far away to see anything, when Sarah has the retrieved car's trunk popped. The body of a teenage girl is found inside. Sarah approaches to tell Stan, but her face confirms his suspicion that Rosie is dead. He screams, as Mitch listens helplessly on the phone. Holder informs Sarah that they checked the plates on the car, which belongs to the Richmond campaign. As police photograph the body in the trunk, Sarah notices the girl is wearing a butterfly necklace. Production In an interview with Mina Hochberg at AMCTV.com, episode director Patty Jenkins stated this about the choice to not be too graphic when revealing Rosie's body in the trunk: \\"I think there were some fears that people would want more graphic detail out of it, but that moment never happened. That [might have been] a dealbreaker for me. I felt like we needed to do the bare minimum to get the point across, not to revel in details. If it had crossed that line I would have been very uncomfortable, and I think everybody would have been very uncomfortable. It's always about what's necessary to tell the story you're telling. This is not a story of sensationalism. This is an emotionally-based story, so that was all we needed and wanted.\\" Reception =Critical reception= The series premiere received universal acclaim from critics. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave the series a very positive review, calling it \\"excellent, absorbing and addictive. When each episode ends, you long for the next ‚Äî a hallmark of great dramas.\\" Goodman also praised Mireille Enos's performance as the lead character Sarah, saying \\"It's not until you watch Enos play Sarah for a while that it sinks in ‚Äî there hasn't been a female American character like her probably ever.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker gave it a B+, saying \\"The acting is strikingly good\\" and that \\"Some viewers may find The Killing a little too cold and deliberate, but give it time. Its intensity builds steadily, giving the series unexpected power.\\" Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun says the series \\"is soaked in atmosphere and steeped in the stark realism of Scandinavian crime novelists Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson\\" and that it \\"is not as much about a young girl's murder as it is a psychological study of what happens afterward, how a tight-knit community tries to recover and how a dead child's mother, father and siblings learn to deal with their pain in their own private ways.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide applauded the series, calling the acting \\"tremendous\\" and that he \\"was instantly hooked by the moody atmosphere of this season-long murder mystery set in Seattle.\\" He went on to say \\"What really stands out for me, in this age of cookie-cutter procedurals, is how The Killing dramatizes the devastation a violent death has on a family, a community, on the people involved in the investigation. Nothing about this show is routine.\\" =Ratings= When it premiered, the pilot episode was AMC's second-highest original series premiere following The Walking Dead. The premiere drew 2.7 million viewers and a 2 household rating. The two encores of the premiere episode brought the ratings of the premiere up to a total of 4.6 million total viewers and a 3.7 household rating. The UK premiere on Channel 4 brought in 2.2 million viewers. =Awards and nominations= The episode received three Emmy Award nominations for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards ‚Äî Veena Sud for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, Patty Jenkins for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, and Elizabeth Kling for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series.

Their report compared relevant attributes of Arbutus Ridge and eight more recently established retirement communities on Vancouver Island.BC Real Estate Foundation ‚ÄúComparative Land Use Typologies‚Äù survey report In a June 2000 article[Down, Susan, \\"Retiring Style\\", Victoria Times-Colonist, June 3, 2000] on Arbutus Ridge, the Victoria Times-Colonist reported: \\"Twelve years after the project's inception, a new generation is buying into the landscape of Vancouver Island's only gated adult community.\\" \\"By the time the last phase is complete, there will be 646 homes creating a community of about 1,200 people.\\" \\"The strata bylaws state that only two people can live in a home and one partner in a couple must be over 50 years old.\\" Arbutus tree, the Community Namesake \\"Both demands and house sizes have increased since the development was first created in 1988. The first houses built in the community were 1,000-1,400 square foot (), one-level designs that were either semi-detached patio homes or ranchers without basements. By 1992, the developer was following the lead of major US retirement builders...a second level with a walk-out basement and sizes ranging 1,800 to 2,100 square feet (). In the newest phase, 80% of the homes are 2,400-2,800 square feet ().\\" \\"For common property and services, residents contribute...a fee...monthly to the strata corporation to manage everything from road maintenance and sewage treatment to garbage collection and security.\\" In spite of the proximity of the golf course, \\"...Arbutus Ridge is not a one-dimensional community.\\" Statistics Canada's 2016 Census classified Arbutus Ridge as \\"a designated unincorporated place in the Cowichan Valley\\" and reported a population of 1063. The reported age range distribution of the population was: 50 and under, 2%; 51‚Äì70, 40%; 71‚Äì80, 36% and over 80, 22%. As previously reported by the BC Real Estate Foundation survey, the community comprises \\"646 individual residential units\\" and includes \\"lifestyle amenities golf, health, business centre, with an activity coordinator\\". The residential neighbourhoods intertwine with the 18-hole Arbutus Ridge Golf Course.http://www.golfbc.com/courses/arbutus_ridge. Arbutus Ridge Golf Course web site.] The community is almost completely developed and the number of houses and the number of residents will not increase significantly in future. Residents voted in June 2009 to ask the Cowichan Valley Regional District to assume operational responsibility for the water, sanitary sewer and drainage systems. In reporting on this transfer from the developer to the municipality after 20 years, the Cowichan Valley Citizen newspaper described Arbutus Ridge as \\"a large luxury subdivision, almost a village\\". Climate History and evolution of the community =CRC Canadian Retirement Corporation and Burrard International Holdings Inc.= In 1983 James Patrick, the founder of Arbutus Ridge, started researching the need for retirement communities in Canada, considering the pattern established in the US Sun Belt with particular reference to the Sun City retirement community in Arizona. CRC Canadian Retirement Corporation (\\"CRC\\") was incorporated[BC Registry Services, Corporate Registry, information records for CRC Canadian Retirement Corporation, company identification BC0306659] under the provincial Business Corporations Act on March 25, 1986, to design and build the community of Arbutus Ridge. Cowichan Valley Regional District issued the Development Permit on April 9, 1987.[CVRD Development Permit #1-C-870P to Crown Street Investments Ltd., April 9, 1987] The CRC development team consisted of Jim Patrick President, Len Reith Vice President and Sales Manager, Bill LeClair Vice President of Finance and Derek Squirell, Vice President Land Development and Golf Course construction. The CRC team was supported primarily by Aplin and Martin Consultants and Davidson Yuen Architects. Arbutus Ridge was incorporated as a bare-land strata, defined in detail in Strata Plan 1601, under what was then called the Condominium Act, (now the Strata Property Act). Registration of the Plan was completed at the BC Land Title Office in Victoria on November 13, 1987.[The Land Title Office Victoria Land Title District, Strata Plan 1601.] The \\"bare land strata\\" term means that ownership of the land is divided among property owners but each individual house is individually owned and central service buildings are collectively owned. Tidman Construction Ltd.Tidman Construction Ltd., section on Arbutus Ridge projects built all the central buildings and houses. A nine-hole golf course was included: holes 12‚Äì16, 2 and 9‚Äì11, identified by current number but listed in original sequence of play. In a framed certificate still on display in the Activity Centre, the developer acknowledged the \\"pioneers\\", naming the first 60 property owners as of May 14, 1988. 113 more lots were opened in 1988 and another 119 lots in 1989. In 1989, with the community about half constructed, the project won the Urban Development Institute Pacific Region's \\"Award of Excellence\\" for having \\"achieved the highest standard of excellence and‚Ä¶demonstrated innovations in design, community consultation and customer satisfaction.\\".[Confirming letter from UDI, Pacific Region, dated February 01, 2012, from Maureen B. Enser, Executive Director] To continue to advance with the second half of the development, an initial public offering of the \\"Arbutus Ridge Development Limited Partnership\\" was made on September 1, 1989. The original IPO prospectus from RBC Dominion Securities Inc. provided background information on the community: financing detail, demographics and appraisal on the basis of amenities, security and relative value of investment.[RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Initial Public Offering, \\"Arbutus Ridge Development Limited Partnership\\", September 1, 1989.] The second half of the development was launched in 1990‚Äì92 with 49, 94 and 31 lots opened respectively in those three years, as the residential section advanced to the south down the steeper slopes and west across Ratcliffe Road. This permitted construction of the last nine holes, 1, 3‚Äì8, 17 and 18 of the golf course and new clubhouse facility and the covered tennis courts. During the wind-down of the construction of the second half of development, CRC brought in Burrard International Holdings Inc.Bloomberg Business Week web page on Burrard International Holdings Inc. as a 50% equity partner. The final 174 lots were opened in six more phases between 1993 and 2010. =Strata Plan 1601 and the self-management era= Self-management of the community began in 1988 with the formation of a transitional Advisory Council, which held its last meeting November 30, 1988, setting the stage for the next phase of governance. Owners, at an Annual General Meeting on January 18, 1989, elected a Strata Council that held its first meeting on January 25. Now that Arbutus Ridge is almost completely built, CRC Developments Ltd.'s day to day involvement in the community is minimal, although Burrard maintains a local presence as parent company of the GolfBC Group,[20] owner of the golf course. A 7-member volunteer Strata Council, elected annually at the community's AGM, is now responsible for the control, management and administration of the common property, common facilities and the assets of the Strata Corporation as outlined in Part 4 of the Strata Property Act: \\"Strata Corporation Governance\\". The Strata Corporation administers the functioning of the community through a number of Strata Committees: Personnel, Communications, Finance, Civil Works, Community Planning, Grounds, Buildings & Facilities, Security and Promotions, each reporting through an elected Councillor. The 2006 census analysis report mentioned earlier shows the way the community has grown: 33% of the homes occupied had been built in 1986‚Äì90, 37% in 1991‚Äì95, 17% in 1996-2000 and 13% since 2001. The Strata Council represents the owners internally, and in all matters regulated by the Act. Administration is carried out in accordance with the Act, and governed by the corporation's registered bylaws and rules. Strata Corporation staff is responsible for the overall operation and fiscal management Additionally, the Arbutus Ridge Ratepayers Association (ARRA) was incorporated[Ministry of Finance, BC Registry Services certificate of incorporation for Arbutus Ridge Ratepayers' Association, society S-0026437] on July 19, 1990, under the BC Society Act to represent homeowners in external matters such as health, transportation, public utilities, community growth and development, environmental protection and social amenities, all of which fall outside the scope of the Strata Property Act. Arbutus Ridge Emergency Preparedness, the community's volunteer organization integrates its efforts with those of the municipal CVRD Public Safety Department.CVRD Emergency Management On a monthly basis, the community publishes its own newsletter, \\"Ridge Talk\\", which is circulated free to all residents. In this newsletter readers will find a calendar of upcoming events, articles on newsworthy topics and a variety of contributions from residents. The Arbutus Ridge web site, www.arbutusridge.ca provides a broad array of current information. The public portion is of broader interest and is open to anyone going to this URL. The residents' section contains further information of specific interest to residents and is accessible only by using an Administration-issued username and password.

It often occurs in quantities below the bark on the fire-damaged birches, but can sometimes be seen on other deciduous trees such as willow and aspen. The larvae thrive in the inner bark which is rich in mycelia, and in the sapwood. They develop into pupae during the summer months under the bark, and they develop over two or three years. The following spring they reproduce themselves. It has over the years have disappeared from southern Sweden and is now only locally in the Norrland coast (V√§sterbotten and Norrbotten) as well as Canada and Alaska. The reason for the species' decline is probably the lack of fire-damaged forests and birch, and the modern forestry practices. Upis ceramboides is considered \\"vulnerable\\" in terms of species survival. In Vindeln municipality it is called ', because it occurs indoors when burning firewood in winter. The species' survival at temperatures well below freezing are attributed to the xylomannan non-protein antifreeze molecule (polysaccharide and a fatty acid) as well as the sugar-alcohol, threitol. Other notable freeze-tolerant animals include the fly Polypedilum vanderplanki and the beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus.

He later became the player-manager for the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League from 1932‚Äì1934.  Playing career  Caveney began his playing career in 1914 and became the starting shortstop for the San Francisco Seals from 1918‚Äì1921. In 1922, he was part of a new left side of the infield for the Cincinnati Reds. His best season was 1923 when he had a .277 batting average and was one of the top defensive shortstops in the National League. Injuries forced him to quit at the end of 1925. In 1926, he returned to the Pacific Coast League playing for the Oakland Oaks for a partial season and a full season in 1927. In 1928, he was traded to the San Francisco Seals where he played until 1934.  Managing career  From 1932‚Äì1934, Caveney was the player-manager for the Seals. Although the Seals won the PCL pennant in 1931 and 1935, they were beaten by the Los Angeles Angels in 1933 and 1934 for the title. The most well-known aspect of his managing career is the early development of Joe DiMaggio's career. Vince DiMaggio was signed by the team in 1932 and towards the end of the season Augie Galan, the starting shortstop, requested to be able to miss the final four games of the season to vacation in Hawaii. The team would be left without a shortstop, so Vince suggested to Caveney that his little brother, playing semi-pro ball at the time, could fill in for a few games, and Caveney agreed. Although he did not play great in the few games, he was invited to the Seals spring training the next season, when he made the opening day team. Joe DiMaggio's defensive play at shortstop was plagued by errors, both fielding errors and overthrowing first base, which persisted into the regular season in 1933. Frustrated by play, Caveney moved Joe into the outfield in the fourth game of the season which became his position for the remainder of the season and his career. Caveney was replaced after the 1934 season by Lefty O'Doul.

A.E. Cham Joof) was a Gambian historian, politician, author, trade unionist, broadcaster, radio programme director, scout master, Pan-Africanist, lecturer, columnist, activist and an African nationalist who advocated for the Gambia's independence during the colonial era.Foroyaa PanoramaJoof, Alh. A. E. Cham. Gambia, the land of our heritage, p. 2. Early life Cham Joof was born on 22 October 1924 at 7 Griffith Street (Half-Die) in Bathurst now Banjul, the capital of the Gambia. He came from a Serer and Wolof background. He was the third child and the eldest son of Ebrima Joof (1887‚Äì1949) and Aji Anna Samba (1896 ‚Äì 9 April 1977). On his father's side (the Joof family), he was a descendant of the JoofJoof is spelled Diouf ‚Äì the French spelling in Senegal Dynasty of Sine and Saloum, and the NjieNjie is spelled Ndiaye in Senegal Dynasty of Jolof. On his mother's side, he was the great grand-nephew of Tafsir Sa Lolly Jabou Samba ‚Äî a 19th-century Senegambian jihadist, military strategists and advisor to Maba Diakhou B√¢ and one of the commanders of his army. Cham Joof was the elder brother of Gambian barrister Alhaji Bai Modi Joof. = Education = Cham Joof started his schooling just before his 12th birthday. He attended the St. Mary's Personage at the Priest's Residence in 1935. Having completed his first key stage, he proceeded to St. Mary's Kings School (St Mary's Anglican School) under the guidance of Reverend John Colley Faye (commonly known as Rev. J. C. Faye). He was there until 1940. Having passed his Standard Four Examination, he progressed to St. Augustine's High School (now St Augustine's Secondary School) with prominent Gambian political personalities like Alhaji Kebba Conteh, M. L Drammeh and Michael Baldeh. Cham Joof was a passionate football player. While at St. Augustine's High School, he was selected as the School's goalkeeper. His favourite subjects included history and religious studies. He completed his schooling in 1945 which coincided with the end of World War II. After his schooling, he got a job with CFAO (Compagnie Fran√ßaise de l'Afrique Occidentale) where he had worked as a Commercial Clerk until 1962.  Scouting movement  The Scout Woodbadge. Cham Joof is termed the \\"doyen of scouting in the Gambia\\". He grew up from the Wolf Cub Scout and served the movement from 1938 to 2005 when he retired as the President of the Gambia National Scout Council. Cham Joof wrote extensively about the history of Scouting in the Gambia. In 1943 he was appointed leader of the Gambian Contingent of Boys Scout travelling to Mali.The Point. From 1946 to 1952, Cham Joof was appointed Assistant Scout Master. He was the founder and first Group Scout Master of 5th Bathurst (now Banjul). In the late 1940s, Cham Joof represented the Gambia's Scout movement and delivered a speech in front of King George VI in London. Cham Joof was the first Gambian Scout to be awarded the Wood Badge by the Chief Scout, which was held in 1954 at the International Scout Leader training centre at Gilwell Park in England. It was during his scouting days that he was appointed by the Gambia Scouts Council to represent the youth at the Coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. In 1957, Cham Joof was selected as the Leader of the Gambia Contingent at the World Scout Jamboree which was held at Sutton Coldfield in Birmingham (England). From growing up as a Wolf Cub Scout to becoming a Scout Master, Commissioner in Charge of Training and President of the Gambia Scout Council, Cham Joof gave a rare interview with Foroyaa Panorama in which he stated: :\\"Scouting, which is a supplementary to education, was dear in my heart and I served the movement from 1938 up to date.\\"  Party politics and activism (colonial period)  Under the guidance of Rev. J. C Faye and Ibrahima Momodou Garba-Jahumpa (I.M. Garba Jahumpa), Cham Joof entered politics and in 1954 defeated his opponent Paul Njie and was elected as a Town Councillor for the Soldier Town Ward in Banjul Central. At the end of his first term in office, Cham Joof stood again in 1958 unopposed. While at the Council, Cham Joof held several positions including: Chairman of the Colony Team (equivalent of the Physical Planning Unit of the Ministry for Local Government); Chairman of the Parks, Open Space and Cemetery Committee. By 1961 he was appointed as a Member of the Royal Visit Committee of Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs visit to the Gambia. By 1962, his second term as Councillor came to an end. Though a prominent Councillor, Cham Joof's major break in politics came in 1960 when he was elected Social Secretary of The Gambia Democratic Party (The GDP). The GDP (previously the Gambia Congress Party) was the first political party in the Gambia formed by Rev. J. C Faye in February 1951 at the then Information Bureau at Allen Street in Banjul.Joof, Alh. A. E. Cham. Party Politics in The Gambia, 1945-1970, p. 21.All Africa Cham Joof‚Äôs appointment as Social Secretary, a party he had been a member of since its conception propelled his political career, making him a prominent public figure in the Gambia. = Nationalism = While in politics, Cham Joof held a series of campaigns against the British colonial administration in the Gambia. Such campaigns were to acquire independence for the Gambia from colonial rule. This became a mission after Ghana was granted independence in 1957. In 1958, Cham Joof and his political associates formed an All Party Committee which included political leaders and chiefs. The purpose of which was for self-governance and to determine the political direction of the country. It took 18 months for the Committee to draw up a comprehensive Constitution with the slogan \\"Self-government now.\\" When they finally submitted their Constitution to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Allan Lennox Boyd) through the British Governor, almost 75% of their proposals were rejected. The rejection of their Constitution spearheaded the \\"Bread and Butter Demonstration\\" of 1959.Cham Joof, \\"The root cause of the bread and butter demonstration\\". s.n. (1959).Cham Joof, Party Politics in the Gambia, 1945-1970, pp. 53-56).  The Bread and Butter Demonstration (1959)  The Bread and Butter Demonstration of 1959. Cham Joof in the white hat and shirt holding a file on his hand. Following the British administration's refusal to grant the Gambia independence, Cham Joof organised a pre- demonstration meeting outside his family residence in Albion Place (now Freedom Lane in Banjul). He and his colleagues had previously learned that the Secretary of State for the colonies (Allan Lennox Boyd) was on a day visit to the Gambia (2 June 1959) but had refused to see them to address their demands, citing \\"tight schedule.\\" As such, they organised the meeting to coincide with this visit. In addressing the people and his colleagues, Cham Joof informed them that the colonial authorities have rejected their proposal and the Secretary of State is refusing to see them, and those who want can join them in the march to Government House to demand self-governance. When the demonstrators entered the vicinity of Government House, they started chanting: \\"We want right and justice.\\" A member of the public started to chant \\"we want bread and butter\\", which was then copied by everyone and this is how the \\"Bread and Butter\\" came about. This incident is commonly known as \\"the Bread and Butter Demonstration\\" in the Gambia. Cham Joof and his associates were refused an audience with the Secretary of State for the Colony, and a British field force was ordered to beat the unarmed demonstrators and used tear gas against them in order to stop them from entering Government House in Banjul. The demonstrators were defiant and demanded to see the Secretary of State. In the midst of this, the Police Superintendent Mr Ferguson instructed his Secretary Miss Clark to type a Rights Act with the content: \\"Anybody seen at the vicinity of the Governor's house will be tried and imprisoned for 5 years.\\" Cham Joof and some of his colleagues were indicted as \\"inciting the public to disobey the laws of the land.\\" He and his colleagues like Crispin Grey Johnson (not to be confused with Crispin Grey-Johnson - Secretary of State for Higher Education as of 2008) and Mr M. B. Jones (both members of the Aku ethnic group) were arrested and taken to court and termed political prisoners.Jawara, Dawda Kairaba, Kairaba, (2009), p. 200, In spite of their protestation to the presiding magistrate, the case went on for three months. Their Gambian lawyer Bamba Saho challenged the colonial authorities and cited the Declaration of Human Rights and \\"Freedom of assembly\\" which led to their release by the Attorney general. =Independence= Under the auspices of the Democratic Congress Alliance (DCA), Cham Joof stood against Pierre Sarr Njie (commonly known as P. S. Njie) at the Legislative Council Election of 1960, but was defeated. In 1961, the British Government decided to appoint P. S. Njie, (who was in the minority) as Chief Minister of the Gambia. This decision was contrary to the wishes of many of the Gambian voters because P.S Njie was in the minority and had lower numerical strength in the Council than Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara (who would later become the first president of the Gambia). As such, the Council was dissolved and a Constitutional Conference was held at Lancaster House in London, in July 1961. Cham Joof and his party members joined the dominant People's Progressive Party (PPP) in 1962 to form the PPP/DCA Alliance. In this new political alliance, Cham Joof stood once again against P. S. Njie but was defeated. According to Cham Joof, he \\"knew that he could not defeat P. S. Njie\\" but upheld his \\"moral dignity as a defector for P. S. Njie not to penetrate into the provinces\\".For Cham Joof's interview, see Foroyaa PanoramaFor more information about these political alliances, see Edie, Carlene J. \\"Democracy in The Gambia: Past, Present and Prospects for the Future\\". Africa Development. Vol. XXV. nos. 3 & 4\\\\. (2000), pp. 2‚Äì4. The date for Self-Governance was fixed for 1962 and Dawda Jawara was appointed Prime Minister of the Colony. In 1964, another Constitutional Conference to determine the date for independence was held at Marlborough House in London where all political parties were represented. The date was finally fixed for February 1965. On 18 February 1965, the Gambia became an independent State and Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara who was knighted by the Queen of England became the country's first president. Although Cham Joof was a member of Dawda Jawara's party (the PPP), he was not one of the main political figures of this party, neither before nor after independence.Gainako. = Trade Unionism = Cham Joof's involvement in the trade union movement was inspired by Edward Francis Small ‚Äì a member of the Aku group who formed the first trade union in the Gambia in 1929 ‚Äì The Bathurst Trade Union and in 1935 the Gambia Labour Union. During the colonial era, there was no Wage Control Board. Gambian workers were required to either accept the low wages paid to them or leave their employment. To oppose this, Edward Francis organized a national strike which lasted for 82 days. The strike however did not achieve its overall objective as low wages and forced taxation continued right up to 1961. In the 1961 groundnut trade season, Cham Joof (a member of the Select Committee) and his associates at the Gambia Workers' Union organized a national strike on behalf of the daily paid workers. The strike went on for five days. Momodou Ebrima Jallow (commonly known as M. E. Jallow), who was then leader of the Gambia Workers' Union, was left with the task to negotiate wage terms with the Chambers of Commerce. The Chambers of Commerce told Jallow to persuade the workers to return to work and their wages will be paid. The workers gathered at the KGV (King George V) playing ground at \\"Half-Die\\" in Banjul to await Jallow's report. Jallow reported to the workers the successful negotiation and asked them to return to work. Cham Joof was suspicious of the British administration and strongly believed that Jallow was being fooled. To express his disapproval, Cham Joof went on the stage and told all the workers not to return to work until their wage demands were met. In Wolof, Jallow told Cham Joof: \\"You are setting the nation on fire,\\" to which Cham Joof replied: \\"I will burn it until it turns to ashes... positive action is the order of the day, nobody is going to work for them.\\" Cham Joof spearheaded a demonstration in Banjul and after their meeting, Jallow was arrested. Cham Joof moved the crowd of demonstrators near his house and set up a Strike Committee which drafted letters of protest and petitions and sent out to international organizations including the United Nations. When he heard of Jallow's arrest, Cham Joof led his followers to the Police Station at Buckle Street and demanded for his immediate release. He galvanized the support of commercial workers, civil servants and the World Assembly of Youth. Jallow was released from prison. The British administration seeing that Gambian workers were in support of the demonstration, requested assistance from the British administration in Sierra Leone to send some officers to the Gambia in order to assist the Gambia's police force. Instead of a huge force, two Commissioners were sent to the Gambia to draft a report in order to amend The Trade Union Act and to institute a Joint Industrial Council. Cham Joof was appointed Chairman of the Joint Industrial Council in the early 1960s. Pan- Africanism From the 1960s, Cham Joof stood out as one of the leading Pan- Africanist in the Gambia. He attended the first Pan-African Youth Movement Conference that was held in Tunisia in 1960 and the second conference in 1961 at Tanzania. In these conferences, he got to meet Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda (who later became first presidents of Tanzania and Zambia respectively) and held political discussions with Kenneth Kaunda (whom he shared a plane with) about gaining independence for Africa. In the first ever Organization of African Unity Conference held on 1 May 1963 at Addis Ababa, Cham Joof delivered a speech to the Members in which he said: :\\"It is barely 75 years when the European Powers sat round the table in Germany each holding a dagger to carve up Africa for its own benefit.‚Ä¶ Your success will inspire and speed up the freedom and total independence of the African continent and eradicate imperialism and colonialism from the continent and eventually neo-colonialism from the globe‚Ä¶ Your failure, which no true African in Africa is praying for, will prolong our struggle with bitterness and disappointment. I therefore adjure that you ignore any suggestion outside Africa and holding that the present civilization, which some of the big powered are boasting of, sprang up from Africa, and realising that the entire world has something earthly to learn from Africa, you would endeavour your utmost to come to agreement, save Africa from the clutches of neo-colonialism and resurrect African dignity, manhood and national stability.\\"The Point Newspaper (Cham Joof's speech). Alex Haley and Roots In 1967, while he was the Secretary-General of the Gambia Farmers Poultry and Fishermen Union, Cham Joof went to the Atlantic Hotel in Banjul to meet his fellow trade union colleague Irving Brown from the American Federation of Labor. A former scout of Cham Joof who was with Alex Haley and his party including George Sim saw Cham Joof and introduced him to Alex Haley who went to the Gambia in search of his roots based on an old story told to him by his family. They requested the assistance of Cham Joof to carry out the research. Cham Joof asked for a grace period to prepare himself for this challenging appointment. He enlisted three of his friends: M. E. Jallow, A. B. Sallah and K. O. Janneh. The four of them set up a research committee and then went on the trail in search of Alex Haley's ancestor, and communicated with Alex constantly after he returned to the United States. Cham Joof and his team expressed some doubt about Kebba Kanji Fofana (the griot at Jufureh) and decided to interview certain Gambians including reputable oral historians who may be knowledgeable on the subject. When Alex visited the Gambia, he set several conditions, some of which included the changing of the title from the originally decided title and the dramatization of the work.

Politics (post-colonial period)  =Jammeh‚Äôs government = After president Yahya Jammeh (president of the Gambia) seized power in 1994 in a military coup d'√©tat, some Gambian statesmen and personalities such as Dr Lenrie Peters; Deyda Hydara; Bishop Solomon Tilewa Johnson; etc. were appointed and made members of the National Consultative Committee, whose brief was to ensure a quick and smooth transition back to democratic rule. Cham Joof was elected as one these statesmen. Discourse with Dr. Jammeh: First things first by Baba Galleh Jallow (former Deputy Editor in Chief of the Daily Observer). Published by Gainako and by Freedom Newspaper (also an online radio station) The Point Newspaper \\"Tribute to Late Alhagie A. E. Cham Joof\\" Wednesday, May 11, 2011 by Mr Momodou Jammeh (Retrieved 2 January 2013) Although he devoted a lot of his time on his books and manuscripts, Cham Joof served as a valuable source of information for the younger generation of Gambian politicians. Some Gambian journalists have criticized president Yahya Jammeh for failing to adhere to the report and recommendations of this Committee, and it is reported that president Jammeh set up this Committee merely to bring respectability, legitimacy and confidence to his regime. In 2002, Cham helped in the creation of the Hansard Unit at the National Assembly. In that same year, he was appointed as a member of the International Committee of Dispute Resolution. History and academia = Radio Gambia = Cham Joof joined the Radio Gambia as a freelance broadcaster in 1968. During his time at Radio Gambia, he was appointed Director of Programme, and spearheaded a radio programme called Chossani Senegambia (the history of Senegambia) with veteran presenters like Alhaji Assan Njie, Alhaji Mansour Njie, etc. The pre-recorded programme was a collaboration effort between Radio Gambia and Radio Senegal. Both radio stations planned for the programme to go live at the same time and date so that Gambian and Senegalese listeners can listen to it at the same time. Cham Joof and his team of journalists travelled throughout the Gambia and Senegal interviewing the elders to narrate the history of Senegambia. In many cases, Senegalese historians made live appearances to Radio Gambia studio and vice versa.Radio Gambia Programmes now GRTS. Cham Joof was an advocate for the revival of Senegambian culture and local languages, and by 1974 was appointed head of local languages. He retired from broadcasting in 1982. =Street names in Banjul= Before the street names in Banjul were changed on 22 August 1998 in an attempt to distant the City from its colonial pastHudgens, Jim & Trillo, Richard, The Rough Guide to West Africa.

He was a dynamic and soft spoken person, who kept a very low profile. His door was always open to anyone in need of his service.\\" Legacy Cham Joof left a legacy of several books and manuscripts about the history of the Gambia and Senegambia in general (Senegal and Gambia), as well as a cultural development within the Gambia. During his lifetime he donated several documents to the Gambia's National Archive (the National Record Services) ‚Äì where he served as Chairman. He was also a philosophical person and had left several proverbs rooted in \\"social consciousness\\" and history.Cham Joof, Reviving a culture that had refused to die (1995), pp. 1-5. Cham Joof is seen as one of the leading Gambian nationalists of the colonial era who worked diligently to achieve independence for the Gambia.The Eye Magazine. \\"The Rocky road to nationhood\\" by Baboucarr Joof, p. 4.

Archworth was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2014. Background Archworth was a chestnut stallion bred in Ontario by William Henry Wright. His sire was the American stakes winner Worthmore, who proved only moderately successful as a sire. Archworth's dam Archipelego was by Samoa, who was imported from Britain and became a moderately successful sire. Archworth was purchased as a yearling in 1937 by George McCullagh, the publisher of The Globe and Mail, for $500. He was trained by Mark Cowell. Racing career Archworth raced nine times at age two, with four wins including the Cup and Saucer Stakes and Clarendon Stakes. He was named the Canadian champion two-year-old of 1938. At age three, Archworth raced 16 times with five wins and three second-place finishes and was named the Canadian champion three-year-old of 1939. He is best known for winning the King's Plate (known as the Queen's Plate when the sovereign is a female) in the first year in which the race was restricted to three-year-olds. It was the first time the Plate had been attended by the ruling monarch, King George VI. Archworth won in a \\"runaway affair\\" by ten lengths, and King George presented 60 gold-plated sovereigns and a gold-plated trophy to McCullagh. Queen Elizabeth was impressed by the colt's front-running style, saying \\"Never have I seen a horse go out and take such a long lead and hold it.\\" McCullagh gave credit to the colt's breeder, William Wright, saying: \\"It's a great day for me, but I am only the stuffed shirt who bought him for $500. My thrill is nothing at all compared to the joy in Bill Wright's heart. It's been a lifelong dream. When he came to this country from England he used to watch the races at Woodbine from a knothole in the fence. Standing there, he vowed that if he ever struck it rich, he would try to breed a winner of the Plate. The dream came true today. All the credit goes to Bill, to trainer Mark Cowell, and to jockey Denny Birley.\\" In 1939, Archworth also won the Prince of Wales Plate and Breeders' Stakes. In 1959, the Canadian Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing was formed using these races and the King/Queen's Plate, but only horses that won the races from 1959 onward were recognized as Triple Crown winners. It was not until 2014 that the early winners of the three races were retroactively acknowledged. Archworth then became known as Canada's second Triple Crown winner. Archworth's later career was undistinguished, with only 1 win from 9 starts in 1940 and 5 wins from 13 starts in 1941. In October 1940, he ran second in the Sennings Park Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York. Similar to his performance in the King's Plate the year before, he opened a large lead down the backstretch. This time however he was caught in the stretch and lost by a head. In 1941, he finished third in the Hendrie Memorial Handicap and Queen‚Äôs Cup Handicap and won the Maple Leaf Hockey Club handicap, an overnight night stakes. Retirement Archworth was retired to stud where he had an undistinguished career. Jockey Club statistics show he had 45 foals of whom 39 became runners with 24 winning at least one race. His most successful offspring was Victory Arch, who won 14 races from 38 starts, including the Prince of Wales Plate.

His ideas about conceptual modeling foundations and theory have been applied in field as: * Semantics in databases for generalized functional dependencies for user-friendly database designing, * Co-design as a holistic approach for collaboration and corporation in design of information systems applications, * Micro, meso and macro levels of users work leading to the development of collaboration frameworks for distributed Web information systems, * Conceptualization of theories in various application areas for the foundation of content management systems, * Model suites as the design theory and foundation of multi-model engineering for handling information system models and their evolution complexities, * Business process modeling and notations beyond business process modeling leading to database management foundations, and * The systematic development of internet sites leading to Web information systems. = Higher Order Extended Entity‚Äìrelationship model = The Higher Order Extended Entity‚Äìrelationship model (HERM) and dependencies in relational databases serve as the foundation of many systems analysis and design methodologies, computer-aided software engineering tools, and repository systems. The HERM Model is the basis for wide number of commercial projects in Germany and Europe, and is commonly cited as the definite reference for foundations of database management systems and entity‚Äìrelationship modeling. The approach has been ranked as one of the top methodologies for database design and systems development by several surveys of high-profile companies. A web information system (WIS) is an information system that can be accessed through the world ‚Äì wide ‚Äì web. On a high level of abstraction a WIS can be described by a storyboard which in an abstract way specific who will be using the system, in which way and for which goals. (B.

He was Regius Professor of Divinity at Trinity College, Dublin (the University of Dublin) from 1888 to 1907.Burke‚Äôs Irish Family Records, Burke‚Äôs Peerage Ltd., 1976. Biography John Gwynn (1827-1917) was the eldest son of the Reverend Stephen Gwynne (1792-1873). The Gwynne family had been settled in Ulster since the 17th century. The spelling of the family surname had varied throughout the earlier years; it was John Gwynn, the subject of this article, who settled on \\"Gwynn\\" with no \\"e\\". John‚Äôs grandfather John Gwynne (1761-1852) had studied at Trinity College, Dublin. after taking a degree in Divinity he was ordained and became Rector of Kilroot near Carrickfergus, County Antrim. His elder son Stephen (1792-1873), John Gwynn‚Äôs father, followed a similar career route, graduating from Trinity College, Dublin and becoming Rector of Larne, County Antrim, and then Rector of Portstewart, County Londonderry. Letter written by John Gwynn's daughter Lucy describing Mary Stevenson's death by drowning When John Gwynn was only ten years old his mother Mary Stevenson was drowned, together with her maid, while bathing off the rocks on the Londonderry coast. The two daughters and four young sons were later taken in hand by a stepmother.Letter written by Lucy Penelope Gwynn to Dorothy Gwynn, 23 October 1940 (in family possession). John was educated at Enniskillen Royal School in Ulster, and then followed family tradition by going to Trinity College, Dublin. His father's diary (still preserved at Trinity) records John's success in the entrance examinations, in the winter of 1845: Four years later, as an undergraduate, John Gwynn stood outside Trinity College and watched William Smith O'Brien and other political prisoners being marched through the streets of Dublin on their way to Kingstown (D√∫n Laoghaire), where a convict ship was waiting to transport them to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania).Revolutionary Imperialist: William Smith O‚ÄôBrien 1803-1864, Richard Davis, Crossing Press 1998. At TCD, John studied mathematics, and was awarded a BA in that subject in 1850. He soon became a Fellow of Trinity, spending the years 1853 to 1856 in minor academic posts at the university. He was then appointed Warden (Headmaster) of St Columba's College at Rathfarnham in County Dublin, a secondary school for sons of the gentry, on the lines of an English public school, which had been founded fourteen years earlier. Around the time John took up this post in 1856, William Smith O'Brien was allowed to return to Ireland and rejoin his family. Two of O'Brien's sons had already been attending St Columba's and a third was due to start there. And so John Gwynn finally met the man he had watched marching in chains a few years earlier. Six years later John married O'Brien's eldest daughter, Lucy Josephine. The two sons of Anthony Trollope, the novelist, were admitted to St Columba's in 1858, but were withdrawn the following year after John Gwynn had sent one of them home in disgrace, accused of a serious misdemeanour.Anthony Trollope, Victoria Glendinning, Pimlico 1993. John continued studying while working. He took his MA in 1854 and became a Bachelor of Divinity in 1861. After taking holy orders he spent the next twenty years (1863 to 1883) working as a clergyman in County Donegal and County Londonderry. He was much involved in the process of \\"disestablishment\\" of the Church of Ireland, which took place in 1869. Simultaneously he was preparing to take his Doctorate in Divinity from Trinity, which he achieved in 1880. Then in 1883 he returned to Trinity College as a Divinity Lecturer; five years later he was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity. A meticulous scholar and linguist, John had mastered Latin, Greek and Hebrew while an undergraduate student, and later taught himself Syriac. He studied Syriac while commuting by train between Ulster and Dublin, partly in order to give himself some mental occupation during the journey. Over the years he published numerous learned articles. His greatest work, which took him twenty years to complete, was a landmark annotated edition of a ninth century Irish manuscript written in Latin and known as the Book of Armagh.Ireland Within The Union 1800-1921, Desmond Keenan. John Gwynn also produced editions of the five books missing from the traditional canon of the New Testament which are found in the Aramaic New Testament of the Peshitta: 2 John, 3 John, 2 Peter, Jude (all in 1893), and Revelation (in 1897).Two memoirs on the Syriac versions of the New Testament, John Gwynn, 1893. He worked from twenty different manuscripts for the epistles, but had to rely on only one, the Crawford Aramaic New Testament manuscript, for Revelation.The Apocalypse of St. John: In a Syriac Version Hitherto Unknown, John Gwynn, 1897. These were later added to the Gospels and Epistles of Philip E. Pusey and George Gwilliam to produce the 1905 United Bible Societies standard edition of the Syriac Peshitta. Family John and Lucy Gwynn had eight sons and two daughters. Their elder daughter, Lucy Penelope Gwynn (1865-1947), made a notable contribution to the cause of women's education when she was appointed the first Lady Registrar at Trinity College. In this role, she helped private women students from England to benefit from the college's pioneering \\"equal rights\\" policy and proceed to a degree, as well as looking after the interests of female Trinity students. She never married.Us, A Family Album, Roger Gwynn, 2015. The younger daughter, Mary Katharine Gwynn (1879-1955), married widower Henry Cole Bowen of Bowen's Court, County Cork, thus becoming the stepmother of writer Elizabeth Bowen. In later life Mary suffered from severe deafness.Bowen‚Äôs Court, Elizabeth Bowen, Virago Press 1984. Stephen Lucius Gwynn (1864-1950), the eldest and most famous of the sons, was an MP, a prominent Irish patriot and a prolific writer. He married his first cousin, Mary Louise (1865-1941), known as May Gwynn, who was the eldest daughter of the Reverend James Gwynn (1829-1869), pastor of the fashionable Octagon Chapel in Bath. May, with her children, entered the Roman Catholic church while in her thirties, and her second son Aubrey Osborn Gwynn SJ later became a Jesuit priest.Dictionary of National Biography. Other sons were Edward John Gwynn (1868-1941), an academic like his father, sometime Provost of Trinity College, Dublin; Major General Sir Charles William Gwynn KCB (1870-1963), sometime Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley; Lucius Henry Gwynn (1873-1902), another Trinity academic as well as a brilliant cricketer and footballer, who died of TB at an early age; Arthur Percival Gwynn (1875-1898), again a talented cricketer, who joined the Indian Civil Service, was sent out to Burma and died there, of septicaemia, at the age of twenty-one; Robert (Robin) Malcolm Gwynn (1877-1962), a cleric-academic like his father, who was a long-serving, very active Fellow of Trinity College and a bold champion of liberal causes; John Tudor Gwynn (1881-1956), at various times Indian Civil Servant, journalist and writer, and head of Baymount Preparatory School near Dublin; and Brian James Gwynn (1883-1972), soldier then Irish civil servant. John Gwynn (professor) and John Gwyn (philanthropist) Ellen Green's letter to her cousin John Gwynn In the 1880s John Gwynn corresponded with relatives in an effort to clarify the relationship of the well known Derry benefactor John Gwyn to his own branch of the family. John Gwyn had died in 1829, leaving a substantial bequest with which the Gwyn Charitable Institution had been set up in Derry. The exact line of kinship connecting John Gwyn to John Gwynn was never established, but Mrs Ellen M. Green, John Gwynn‚Äôs third cousin and the sister of John Gwynne, a Judge of the Canadian Supreme Court, testified that John Gwyn the benefactor had regarded her late father (Rev William Gwynne DD) as his closest relative.Letter from E.M. Green to John Gwynn, c.1880, now in the Gwynn archive at Trinity College Dublin. Thus there is every reason to suppose that John Gwynn the professor and John Gwyn the philanthropist were indeed related. E.M. Green's letter to John Gwynn reads: \\"I know that my Father was the nearest & best loved relative of Mr John Gwynne who founded the Institution...\\" She further mentions that her brother John was the Derry benefactor's godson and inherited a gold watch from him.

In 1996, he was imprisoned for seditious libel after writing a satirical article about Ivorian President Henri Konan B√©di√©. The following year, he won an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in 2000, he was named one of the International Press Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past 50 years. Background Neruda is an alumnus of the University of Abidjan. After his graduation, he worked as a high-school mathematics teacher until 1988, when he became a copyeditor at the Ivorian daily Ivoir' Soir. By 1990, he was working as an investigative reporter under the name \\"Freedom Neruda\\". This pen name is a homage to Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, whose work Freedom Neruda finds inspiring. After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own independent newspaper, La Chronique du Soir, Neruda agreed to take over the newly founded La Voie in 1991. With Neruda as its editor-in-chief, La Voie quickly went on to become the best-selling independent newspaper in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. The paper regularly ran critical coverage of the government of President B√©di√©, resulting in several court appearances on defamation charges and prison sentences for at least six members of the editorial staff. In 1995, the paper's offices were firebombed, but no one was hurt. \\"Il maudit l'ASEC\\" trial On 18 December 1995, La Voie ran an article on the Ivorian ASEC Mimosas's loss to the South African Orlando Pirates in the finals of football's CAF Champions League. A sidebar by reporter Emmanuel Kor√©, headlined \\"Il maudit l‚ÄôASEC\\" (\\"He cursed/jinxed ASEC\\"), jokingly suggested that the bad luck of President B√©di√©'s presence had caused the team's defeat; the article also played on the slogans from B√©di√©'s re-election literature of the previous year, in which he promised to bring \\"good luck\\" to the nation. Although the sidebar was one of the less serious criticisms of the B√©di√© government that had appeared in La Voie, by naming the president explicitly, it posed a direct challenge to a 1991 statute allowing the state to prosecute \\"people who insult government officials or offices\\" for criminal libel. Kor√© and La Voie's publication director Abou Drahamane Sangar were arrested shortly after the article's appearance. A warrant was also issued for Neruda, who evaded arrest for several days to arrange care for his ten-year-old son. On 2 January 1996, Neruda turned himself in at a police station and was also arrested. On 11 January, Neruda, Kor√© and Sangar were convicted of \\"offenses against the head of state\\" and sentenced to two years' imprisonment apiece. Additionally, La Voie was fined three million West African CFA francs (about $6000 USD) and banned from publishing for three months; the paper avoided the ban by publishing under the name L'alternative for the duration of the sentence, returning to its original name when the ban was complete. During his imprisonment, Neruda continued to write news stories from jail, smuggling them out and publishing them in L'alternative under the apparently female pen name \\"Bintou Diawara\\". His topics included a financial scandal and the more lenient sentences given to wealthy Lebanese prisoners. When the three journalists appealed their sentences to the Supreme Court in August, President B√©di√© appeared on television offering them a pardon if they would withdraw the appeal. Feeling that this would be a tacit admission of guilt, the journalists refused the offer. The Supreme Court rejected their appeal in November, but the three were nonetheless released on 1 January 1997, having served only half of their sentences. International recognition In November 1997, 10 months after his release, Neruda was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". In 2000, the International Press Institute selected him as one of its \\"50 World Press Freedom Heroes\\" of the past 50 years, citing his \\"unwavering commitment to the principles of free expression despite the persistent efforts of President Henri Konan B√©di√© to silence La Voie's critical coverage of the government\\".

He became a pupil of the Milanese sculptor Giuseppe Franchi at the Brera Academy, but was strongly influenced by Antonio Canova. Dante and Beatrice (1813) In 1798, he supported the revolution that led to the establishment of a brief Roman Republic. Upon this revolutionary failure, he fled to Grenoble. When the North of Italy was evacuated by the Austrian troops, he moved to Milan, and in 1800 was named Conservator of National studio of Sculpture. Over the next decade he moved around many times throughout the north of Italy, and to Paris, where he set up a studio for portrait busts. Among his work was a larger than life, hagiographic plaster statue of Napoleon the Peacemaker (1801). The statue while generating interest, was not commissioned in more lasting materials. Political problems caused him to move frequently. He then moves back to Grenoble and from there to Turin, where in 1802 he completes a series of busts of Napoleon, Jourdan, Brune, and Massena for the local atheneum. He was briefly named professor or sculpture of the Accademia Albertina of Turin. The production of busts and works for private patrons supported him. After 1816 till about 1820, he moved to London, where despite his prior adulation of Napoleon, he was flattered with repeated commissions. There he made busts of Lord Fox, of the Duke of Gloucester, of the Marquis of Buckingham, of Thomas Grenville, and also completed the marble altar for the Catholic Church of St. Mary Moorfields, reconsecrated in London in 1820. Around 1820, he returns to Milan. There he continued portraiture for patrons. This remained among his best works, often depicting the patrons with brio and nobility. Political troubles continued to plague him, including a spell in jail. He would travel frequently to France. In Italy, political problems led him to move periodically among cities of Northern Italy. He continued to make celebratory statuary and busts of Napoleon . Among his works are: * The famous, though reactionary, outdoor sculptural group of Dante and Beatrice (1813) in the Villa Melzi at Bellagio, Lago di Como. * Statue of The Redeemer for the chapel in Villa Melzi. * Bust of Chaptal in Montpellier. * Bust of Eugenio di Beauharnais in Versailles . * Busts of Vincenzo Monti and Abbott Giovanni Battista Casti in Ambrosiana, Milan. * A memorial remembering the Treaty of Campoformio in Udine. * Statues of the campanile by Cagnola and Arc of Peace in Urgnano.

He was created and is portrayed by Rowan Atkinson and made his first appearance on television in the pilot episode which first aired on 1 January 1990. Overview Mr. Bean lives in Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, Highbury, London, England. His first name, which he refers to as Bean, and his profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the first film adaptation, Bean, \\"Mr.\\" appears on his passport in the \\"first name\\" field, and he is shown employed as a guard at London's National Gallery.Mel Smith, Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, 1997 His date of birth is given variously as 15 September 1956, or as 6 January 1955 (the latter being Rowan Atkinson's actual date of birth). At the beginning of episode two onwards, Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light, accompanied by a choir singing Ecce homo qui est faba (\\"Behold the man who is a bean\\"), recorded by Southwark Cathedral Choir in 1990. These opening sequences were initially in black and white in episodes two and three, and were intended by the producers to show his status as an \\"ordinary man cast into the spotlight\\". However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of St Paul's Cathedral. At the end of episodes three and six he is also shown being sucked right back up into the sky in the respective background scenes (black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Atkinson has acknowledged that Mr Bean \\"has an alien aspect to him\\".\\"The Fine Art of Being Mr. Bean\\", archive interview in The Buffalo News. Retrieved 15 June 2006. In the animated series (episode, \\"Double Trouble\\") he is taken inside a spacecraft with \\"aliens\\" who look exactly like him and even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original Mr. Bean series. Clothing Mr. Bean wears a brown tweed jacket, a white shirt, a thin red tie, brown trousers, black shoes and a black digital calculator watch. He occasionally changes his outfit to suit the scene he is in. In the episode The Return of Mr. Bean, when Bean is heading to a fancy restaurant to celebrate his birthday, he wears a grey suit with a dark red tie. In the same episode Bean wears a tuxedo. In the episode The Curse of Mr. Bean, when Bean is heading for the park to make a sandwich for his lunch, he wears a long dark green overcoat with a light green shirt and a dark green tie. In the same episode when Bean goes to watch a horror film with his girlfriend, he is wearing his trademark clothes but with a light colored brown sweater instead of his trademark brown tweed jacket. Personality Mr. Bean is childish, selfish, extremely competitive and brings various unusual schemes and contrivances to everyday tasks. He rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically low-pitched voice. He also does not like people taking his things. Mr. Bean often seems unaware of basic aspects of the way the world works, and the programme usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, redecorating or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems ‚Äì usually self-inflicted ‚Äì and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness and occasional malevolence. Influences Atkinson cited the earlier comedy character Monsieur Hulot, created by French comedian and director Jacques Tati, as an influence on the character.Transcript of interview with Rowan Atkinson at bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 14 March 2008. Atkinson also cited the influence of Peter Sellers, who had previously played similar \\"fumbling fool\\" characters, notably Hrundi Bakshi in The Party (1968) and Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther films. Appearances Mr. Bean is the main character of both the titular TV series and its animated spin-off Mr. Bean: The Animated Series, as well as of feature films based on the series, Bean (1997) and Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). Bean also made guest appearances at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony and in the 2017 Chinese film Top Funny Comedian: The Movie. Atkinson also portrayed Bean in several sketches for Comic Relief and also in television advertisements throughout the years such as REMA 1000, M&M;'s, Fujifilm, Nissan Tino and most recently for Snickers in 2014.

Adjustomatic Acoustic Guitars Most acoustic guitars on the second-hand market are the Adjustomatic brand, noted by the fact that the guitar comes apart in two pieces - the neck and the body, through the clever and simple use of a long screw that holds the neck to the body. A threaded bolt turns against a small piece of 90-degree angle iron to allow the musician to easily adjust the string action, that is, the closeness of the strings to the fretboard on the neck. The guitar can be disassembled, reassembled and string action set with the use of a simple screwdriver. Jackson Guldan Adjustomatic Guitar. The Adjustomatic guitars measure 36 inches long, which puts them in the Parlor Guitar category.

In older Sanskrit, ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞ is written as ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞ (karvara).Monier Williams Dictionary In Mythology  Sharvara can be compared with the Greek Cerberus, the mythological dog of the Greeks with similar characteristics. However, there is no description of Cerberus having a companion, and he is usually depicted with three heads.Apolodorus and others indicate that he had three heads, but Hesiod with poetical hyperbole gives him fifty. Scholars have concluded that the three heads were a Greek addition to the underlying Indo-Aryan myth. Shavara can also be compared to Odin's wolves in Norse mythology.Geri and Freki, \\"Greedy\\" and \\"Voracious\\" Odin (the all- father) just like Yama (the progenitor of all humans) sits on a chair guarded by two dogs. Although, Odin (Woden), the hunter, the wanderer, god of storm and winter, is more comparable to the Vedic Rudra. Tilak dates the Vedic antiquity using the assertion that the Milky Way (path of the dead) used to be guarded by Sharvara and a new year started upon the crossing of Milky Way by the sun. Using internal evidence he dated the timeframe of Vedic antiquity (taittriya samhita) to the time when at the vernal equinox the sun rose in the asterism of Orion (Mrigashiras).

Wells, Nevada lies at its north end, on I-80. Clover Valley lies at the east flank of the mostly north-trending East Humboldt Range, which supplies numerous creeks to the north valley; the mountain forests supplying the water are a section of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. A slough exists in the north which drains south to intermittent Snow Water Lake. Description Clover Valley trends north-south. The Wood Hills lie along the northeast and eastern edge, to the southeast of Wells; Spruce Mountain is south-southeast. Dissected lowlands or flatlands surround Snow Water Lake, which lies near the valley's center, except on its west at the East Humboldt Range foothills bordering the lake. History The first permanent settlement at Clover Valley was made in 1864. A station on the Western Pacific Railroad between Ventosa and Wells was named for a directional sign posted on the building pointing the way to the local bar. Crudely written it was read and assumed to be the location of TOBAR. A post office established at the site as Clover City and changed to Tobar December 20, 1911 and renamed Clover City again December 11, 1918. Tobar again became active from January 18, 1921 until it was decommissioned September 17, 1942. Access U.S. Route 93 extends through the valley's west from Wells, south to the south terminus of the East Humboldt Range, at Warm Creek Ranch; Route 93 continues southeasterly to Currie in Goshute Valley. From the west, Nevada State Route 229 from north Ruby Valley connects to US 93 south of Warm Creek Ranch. In the northwest, south of Wells, Nevada 232 follows the foothills west of the Slough region, where about fifteen creeks descend from the East Humboldt Range. All other interior valley regions are accessed by unimproved roads. The north perimeter of the valley is approximately where Interstate 80 travels east from Wells.

Description It is irregular in shape, and situated in a north‚Äìsouth orientation atop a mountain called \\"Castle Hill\\", 20 miles north of Lake Balaton. It has two towers, and is 125 metres long and 80 metres wide. The interior contains a walled pathway. This leads to internal gatehouse that opens into the main courtyard. History The castle hill This castle was originally built in the mid or late 13th century by B√©la IV of Hungary, where he lived during the Mongolian invasion between 1241‚Äì1242. Later, it was presented as a gift to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Veszpr√©m by Stephen V of Hungary.

In 1995, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel described him as \\"Cuba's leading dissident journalist\\". Background Restano began his career as a radio journalist, but an interview he gave to a US journalist saw him spend a short time in prison and then lose his job in 1985. In 1990, he was a founder of the Movimiento de Armon√≠a (MAR; English: \\"Harmony Movement\\"), an unofficial political group which sought \\"to help through our ideas with the transition from state socialism to democratic socialism in our country\\". He also acted as the group's president. 1990 arrest On 20 December 1991, Restano was approached and handcuffed in Vedado, Havana outside of his parents' home. His detainers, who arrived in a private vehicle, took him to the headquarters of the Department of State Security. Six days later, MAR members Berenice Morales, Jorge Ega√±a and Iraida Montalvo Miranda were also arrested. Amnesty International declared the four prisoners of conscience, \\"detained solely on account of their peaceful political activities\\", and called for their immediate release. Restano's trial began on 20 May 1992. Standing trial with him was Mar√≠a Elena Aparicio, a museum employee and fellow MAR member who was said to be MAR's coordinator for Havana. The pair was charged with rebellion; the prosecutor alleged that they had violated Cuban law by forming a political organization without government permission, that they had planned to form clandestine cells for the violent overthrow of the government, and that they had produced and distributed anti-government propaganda materials. Both were convicted, with sentences of ten years of imprisonment for Restano and seven for Aparicio. Restano was then sent to Guanajay Prison, Havana Province, to serve his term. Release and Independent Press Bureau of Cuba founding During a 1995 trip to France by Fidel Castro, Danielle Mitterrand, wife of former French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, requested his release along with that of five other prisoners. Restano was released on 2 June of that year, having completed four years of his ten-year sentence, and France-Libertes, the organization headed by Danielle Mitterrand, was credited by Reuters and other news organizations with having secured his release. Following his release, he stated that he intended to continue working for \\"democracy and human rights\\" in Cuba. On 15 September 1995, Restano founded the Independent Press Bureau of Cuba with the support of the France- based press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders. According to Restano, the following day, two colonels from Cuba's Ministry of the Interior met with him for more than six hours, at one point stating, \\"Someone could kill you, Indamiro. This is the most sensitive area where you are attempting to tread\\". International recognition In 1994, while still incarcerated, Restano won an International Press Freedom Award of the committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". Along with Burmese novelist San San Nwe, he was also given the 1995 PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award, which recognizes writers \\"who have fought courageously in the face of adversity for the right to freedom of expression\\". Following his release, Restano was awarded the 1996 World Association of Newspapers' Golden Pen of Freedom, which recognizes \\"the outstanding action, in writing or deed, of an individual, a group or an institution in the cause of press freedom\\".

Landreth Seed Company is one of the oldest companies in the United States. It was founded on January 7, 1784, by David and Cuthbert Landreth on High Street, (now 1210 Market Street). The David Landreth School in Point Breeze, Philadelphia is named for the founder. History David Landreth was born in 1752 in Northumberland, England. In 1780, Landreth immigrated with his family to Montreal, Canada, to establish a seed company. The harsh Canadian climate forced him to relocate to Philadelphia in 1783. In 1786, he partnered with his brother Cuthbert to run the business in Philadelphia. At first, he sold seeds to the City of Philadelphia and nearby estates. Over time his business grew and George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Joseph Bonaparte were among his customers when they visited the city during the Constitutional Convention in 1787. In 1818, a store was founded in Charleston, South Carolina and a second in St. Louis in 1854 which later closed at the start of the Civil War. Landreth and his son David, who joined the company in 1820, were among the founders of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society in 1827 and produced the first agricultural journal in the United States, Floral Magazine, in 1832. D. Landreth and Sons moved to Bloomsdale Farms to test seeds on 600 acres in Bristol, Pennsylvania in 1847, where the company continued to grow. Seeds were distributed internationally as well as nationally, including to the West Indies, South Africa, India, China and Japan. In 1852, Landreth's supplied seeds for Commander Matthew C. Perry trip to Japan as gifts. Upon Perry's return in 1855, Landreth received the first major importation of Japanese seeds into the United States for cultivation and distribution, including the red shiso and wineberries. David Landreth II (1802‚Äì1880) In 1880, David Landreth II, died and his sons Oliver, Burnet (1869‚Äì1941), and Leopold took over the business. In 1904, the company changed names to D. Landreth Seed Company and was headed by Landreth's great-grandsons. In 1942, it was sold to the Buist Seed Co. of Philadelphia. During World War II the US Government condemned much of Bloomsdale Farms for defense contractors and housing. Suburban sprawl took care of the balance of the farm. The company was sold to the Goldberg Co., which moved it to Baltimore until 2006. In 2003, venture capitalist Barbara Melera purchased the company and became its president in hopes of saving the company from closure. In 2010, the company began turning a profit and customers increased to 4,000 from 350 after a growing interest in heirloom seeds. After using a combination of her personal finances and loans to finance the company, she was later sued by creditors in 2012. In 2016, the company was listed for auction and was acquired by American Meadows, Inc. Products The introduction of the company's creative plant breeding placed them at the forefront of modern cooking preferences. The company introduced the zinnia in 1789, the first truly white potato in 1811, and the tomato in 1820 to the United States. Catalog D. Landreth Seed Company catalog, 1917 Catalogs featured the D. Landreth Seed Company's test fields touting that seeds were fresh because they were grown themselves, any unsold stock at the end of the planting season was burned, and seed packages were labeled with dates ensuring seed viability. After the Civil War, the company began associating itself with nationalism using slogans such as \\"American seeds for the American climate\\" and \\"preeminently the AMERICAN SEED HOUSE\\" as well as employing the Liberty Bell in its logo. In 1881, they took advantage of the new federal trademark law, trademarking the logo and brand names. The catalogs featured illustrative woodcuts until the 1890s, when the company became one of the first to introduce photography in their catalogs to show how the plants appeared in real life. In 2010, Michael W. Twitty worked with the company to compile the African American Heritage Collection of heirloom seeds for the company's 225th anniversary. The collection features roughly 30 plants, including the long-handled dipper gourd and the fish pepper, showcasing how instrumental they were to African-American survival and independence.

Athlone House, formerly known as Caen Wood Towers, is a large Victorian house in Highgate, London, England. Built c.1872, and until the early 1940s the residence of several important industrialists, it is now in a state of disrepair and awaiting restoration by its current owners. It was designed by Edward Salomons and John Philpot in an intricate style, particularly as to shape and brickwork, blending Dutch and classical influences. It lies on the northern edge of Hampstead Heath, from which it can be seen. Origin An engraving (c.1880) of Caen Wood Towers shortly after it was built by Edward Brooke. The house was built by Edward Brooke, who was born in Manchester in 1832.England Census of 1861 He married in 1857 Jane Emily Alston and had many children. He also owned Pabo Hall in Conwy, Wales, which still has his portrait in the hallway. In 1869 Brooke came from Manchester to London and bought Lord Dufferin‚Äôs estate at Highgate. Shortly after, he had the house, originally named Caen Wood Towers, built on this property.North Wales Chronicle (Bangor), 18 October 1890, Issue 3280 The house is chiefly a mixture of classical architecture and neo-Gothic crenular with a tall dutch gable making up the pinnacle of the fa√ßade in front of a multi-turreted tower and with long, narrow Tudor-style chimneys on the left wing. A variety of stone and brick materials is therefore used in appropriate sections and the building can be compared to the generally smaller follies of the time. In 1877, Brooke's first wife, Jane, died and in the following year he married Frances Amyand Bellairs, daughter of the Reverend Henry Walford Bellairs.The Standard (London) 24 December 1877, p. 1 Brooke was a partner in the firm of Brooke, Simpson and Spiller, who were aniline dye manufacturers in London. He became a Justice of the Peace for the County of Middlesex, for the City of London and for the County of Carnarvon. He was also one of Her Majesty‚Äôs Commissioners for the Lieutenancy of the City of London. A book published in 1880, entitled A series of picturesque views of seats of the noblemen and gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland, included a colour engraving of Caen Wood Towers and a descriptive article about Edward Brooke and the house. Brooke left Caen Wood Towers in about 1885 and Francis Reckitt and his family came to live in the house.UK Census of 1891 Francis Reckitt Francis Reckitt 1892. Francis Reckitt was a partner in the company of Reckitt and Sons. His father Isaac had founded the firm and he and his brother Sir James Reckitt were very prominent Directors at the time he lived at Caen Wood Towers. Reckitt was born in 1827 in Lincolnshire. He lived for some years in Hull where the Reckitt and Sons company was based and later moved to Hessle. He was twice widowed and had numerous children before he married Eliza Louisa Whitlock in 1877.United Kingdom Births Deaths and Marriages The 1891 Census shows the family living at Caen Wood Towers and at this time there were four children still living with them. One of them was his son Francis William Reckitt who was an artist. Francis Reckitt became very wealthy and donated a great deal of money to establish public institutions. For example, in 1897 he paid for the Newland Homes Francis Reckitt House for infants. He also provided the funds to establish a new reference library within an existing library in Hull in 1890.The Yorkshire Herald, and The York Herald, 5 November 1890; pg. 5; The Reckitt Convalescent Home (now demolished) was built in 1907 with money donated by Francis.

He was considered one of the best-known commercial men in the City and a chapter was written about him in \\"London Leaders\\" in 1907. Cory-Wright was born in 1839; his father was Lieutenant William Wright of the Rifle Brigade. He was educated privately and entered the firm of William Cory and Sons at the age of 21. He became Chief of the company in 1888 and was credited with the large development of this firm which followed his appointment. In 1868 he married Mima Owen, the youngest daughter of Sir Hugh Owen. They had two sons and three daughters. Cory-Wright was very interested in local affairs, particularly in the Highgate area. He led the movement to save for public use the area then called Churchyard Bottom, now Queen's WoodObituary of Sir Francis Cory-Wright, The Times (London) 31 May 1909; pg. 9 Cory-Wright died at Caen Wood Towers in 1909. His widow remained at the house until 1911 when it was sold to Thomas Frame Thompson, who died two years later in a shooting accident. The property was then sold in 1914 to Charles Henry Watson who also owned a home called Ashmount in Hampstead; in 1919 he sold Caen Wood Towers to Sir Robert Waley Cohen.The Times (London), 9 October 1919; pg. 13 Sir Robert Waley Cohen Sir Robert Waley Cohen circa 1920. Sir Robert Waley Cohen was the Managing Director of the Shell Company. He was the longest and most prominent resident of Caen Wood Towers, living there for more than twenty years between 1919 and 1942. Waley Cohen was born in London in 1877. His father was Nathaniel Louis Cohen and his mother was Julia Waley, daughter of Jacob Waley, Professor at University College, London. After Waley Cohen left Cambridge University he entered the Shell Company, eventually becoming its Managing Director.The Times (London), 29 November 1952; pg. 8 In 1904 he married Alice Violet Beddington and the couple had two sons and a daughter. While they lived at Caen Wood they held numerous social events at the house and Lady Waley Cohen often allowed the gardens to be used for fetes and parties for girls' clubs, Boy Scouts, and to raise money for charity.The Times (London), 25 January 1935; pg. 16; Lady Waley Cohen died in 1935 but Sir Robert continued to live at Caen Wood Towers until about 1942 when it was taken over by the RAF.  Royal Air Force Station Highgate  In September 1942, the house was acquired by the Air Ministry. The RAF Intelligence School, formerly housed in a number of nearby houses in Highgate, moved into Caen Wood Towers. The site, officially named Royal Air Force Station Highgate, occupied the grounds and outbuildings of the Caen Wood estate. It included accommodation, messing, equipment stores and a medical centre. Because of the sensitivity of intelligence and covert operations during the war, the site's purpose was not made public and it operated under the guise of an RAF convalescence hospital. A number of different courses were run, teaching Air Intelligence, Escape and Evasion, and Basic Intelligence Analysis for direct entrants to intelligence work. Most of the instruction was given by visiting specialists (from the Air Ministry, MI6, MI9, Central Interpretation Unit at RAF Medmenham and Station X at Bletchley Park). During World War II, over 6,000 officers of the British services (including dominion and Allied Forces attached to the RAF) attended intelligence training courses at the house. A description of the training given during the war at the house is contained in the book Shot Down and on the Run. In late 1944, the school was hit twice by German V-1 flying bombs causing damage to the buildings and injuring a number of staff. Following the end of the war, training continued at RAF Highgate until 1948 when the Air Ministry decided that the School should move to the Air Ministry building as they were de-requisitioning the property. RAF Highgate (Caen Wood Towers) was handed over to the Ministry of Health in 1951 and its previous role remained an Official Secret until 2005 when files (such as the unit's Form 540) were declassified and made available to the public in the National Archives. The site was acquired by the Ministry of Health in 1951, renamed Athlone House in 1955 as part of the Middlesex Hospital Group, and converted into a pre - convalescent home for those not well enough to go to The Middlesex Hospital's Convalescent Home in Clacton. A new building was added for geriatric care.  Present day  The hospital was closed in 2003 and the site was sold to Dwyer Investments. The wing added in the 1940s and a 1970s extension were demolished, and three new blocks of luxury apartments built in their stead, called Kenwood Place. The original house was sold in 2006 to a Kuwaiti businessman of the Kharafi family for a reported ¬£16 million. Planning permission to build a new house on the site was refused by Camden Council in 2010, and the refusal upheld by the Planning Inspectorate in 2011.Athlone House decision, The Planning Inspectorate, 21 April 2011. In 2014 the developers Athlone House Limited again appealed against the decision to the Planning Inspectorate, but this was rejected in June 2015Plans for ¬£80m London mega-mansion rejected after six-year battle, The Guardian, 8 June 2015. after objections from The Highgate Society, which raised a 5000-signature petition to preserve the house.Objection letter, The Highgate Society, January 2014. In January 2016, the Evening Standard reported that the house had been sold for about ¬£20 million and that the new owners had contacted Camden Council \\"to discuss refurbishment plans\\", which were thought to include keeping the original house and building flats in the large gardens. In April 2016, it was reported in the Sunday Times that the Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman had purchased Athlone House for ¬£65 million.http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article1687952.ece See also *Beechwood House, borders Athlone House to the east *Kenwood House, to the west.

Source: Commercial Telegraphers' Journal, 1919, p. 458. Involvement with telegraphers' unions and the suffrage movement In about 1880, she began work as a commercial operator for Western Union. She joined the telegraphers' union, the Brotherhood of Telegraphers, which was affiliated with the Knights of Labor. She joined in their strike against Western Union in 1883. When the strike ended unsuccessfully, she left Western Union and began work as a press operator in Amsterdam, New York, where she sent and received press dispatches. This was the beginning of a long career as a press telegrapher; she subsequently operated for the Rochester Post Express in Rochester, New York, the Consolidated wire at the Buffalo Evening News in Buffalo, New York, and for the United Press Association in the offices of the Lockport Union Sun in Lockport, New York.

However, the strike was unsuccessful; after the union's president, S. J. Konenkamp, resigned, a new slate of officers was elected, including Mary Macaulay, who became International Vice President. One of her first actions was to set up a defense fund for strikers who had been arrested in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In the following year, federal charges against the strikers were dropped. She served as International Vice President until 1921.Jepsen, Thomas C., My Sisters Telegraphic: Women in the Telegraph Office, 2000, Ohio University Press, pp. 182-3. Later life and retirement In 1927, she retired from her work as press telegrapher for the Lockport Union Sun and returned to LeRoy, New York.

He is the Founder and Ex Officio Chairman of Make Some Noise: Cure Kids Cancer Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) established to raise funds exclusively for childhood cancer research and increase awareness for these diseases. Malcolm had led a normal childhood as the youngest of three boys until he began to experience pain in his hip at age ten. Thus began his journey into childhood cancer. Diagnosed in early December 2008 with a pediatric bone cancer called Pelvic Ewing's Sarcoma, he immediately began raising funds for research and speaking out about pediatric cancer. As he got further into his treatments, he learned about the heavy disproportion of research funding that goes towards adult cancer research over childhood cancer research. Eight rounds of chemotherapy into his 14-round treatment protocol, he experienced the loss of a young cancer patient just two doors down from his own hospital room. Malcolm was deeply moved by this child's passing, and ten-year-old Malcolm noted that someone needed to \\"make some noise\\" about childhood cancer, and announced that he needed to start a foundation. He spent the remainder of his bone cancer treatments finishing chemotherapy, learning to walk without a hip, and getting the foundation ready to launch. The month following the end of Malcolm's treatment, Make Some Noise: Cure Kids Cancer was officially incorporated on September 24, 2009, and in just over two years the young entrepreneur has made significant progress. He has released two awareness videos, \\"1 in 320\\" and both of which can be found on the foundation's YouTube Channel. His foundation was selected as a Top 3 finalist for \\"Best New Charity\\" in the 2011 Classy Awards, he was honored by NJ's First Lady, Mary Pat Christie, as a \\"NJ Hero\\" in January 2012. Malcolm has toured the country meeting with researchers and learning about the issues they face in securing funding.

It is three miles east of Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in Juneau County. It is part of the \\"effigy mound culture\\" of native peoples in Wisconsin, who practiced the \\"respectful burial of their dead\\". Humans first inhabited Wisconsin about 12,000 years ago, and the use of burial mounds developed in between 500 BC to 1000 AD during what is referred to as the Woodland period. The burial mounds during the late Woodland period tended to be built as effigies of birds, bears, and panthers, and examples of these can be found in the Cranberry Creek Archeological District. As with other burial mounds on state property, the mounds in this region are protected against unauthorized disturbance. Many of the best examples of mounds in this area are on the east side of Cranberry Creek. In addition to effigies, conical, linear, and oval mounds are found. Although archeological studies have been conducted here since 1917, and farming has damaged parts of the northern cluster, the cluster in the southern section is essentially unaltered by modern man. Cranberry Creek Archeological District encompasses one of the larger mound groups in Wisconsin with over 300 mounds, and possibly up to 500 mounds. Cranberry Creek Mound Group is owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and covers . The area is heavily forested, containing river birch, silver maple, red maple, jack pine, and oak.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 59th Attorney General of New Jersey from January 10, 2012 until June 6, 2013. Prior to his tenure as New Jersey Attorney General, he served as Chief Counsel to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Christie announced on June 6, 2013 that he would appoint Chiesa to the United States Senate seat that was vacated by the death of Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg and on June 10, 2013, Chiesa was sworn in. He declined to run for the remainder of the Senate term in the 2013 special election, which was subsequently won by Democrat Cory Booker, Mayor of Newark. Early life, education and early law career Chiesa grew up in Bound Brook, New Jersey, the eldest of three children. When he was 8 years old, his father, a chemical plant worker, died, and he was raised by his mother, a public school teacher. He attended Bound Brook High School and graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1987 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting. He earned his J.D. from the Columbus School of Law at The Catholic University of America in 1990. In 1988, Chiesa joined the Cranford law firm of Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci (now known as Dughi & Hewit). There he met and befriended Chris Christie, who had joined the firm the year before. U.S. Attorney's Office In 2002, he followed Christie to the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, where he led a number of the office's high-profile public corruption cases, including the one against former State Senate President John A. Lynch Jr. He served as Counsel to the U.S. Attorney, Chief of the Public Protection Unit, and Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney. He left in 2009 to become a partner in the firm of Wolff & Samson. Chief Counsel to Governor Christie In 2009, after Christie was elected Governor of New Jersey, Chiesa headed his transition team. Christie then named Chiesa his chief counsel. In June 2010, Christie sent him to speak to Republican Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll, to persuade him to drop his opposition to the budget because it cut proportionally more aid to suburban schools than to urban ones. Attorney General of New Jersey On December 12, 2011, Governor Christie nominated Chiesa to succeed Paula Dow as Attorney General of New Jersey. Chiesa was sworn in as Dow's successor on January 10, 2012. Chiesa supported mandatory drug rehab treatment for non-violent drug offenders and holding violent defendants without bail. In January 2012, he proposed a comprehensive program to crack down on prescription drug abuse addictions and overdoses. In February 2012, he helped deliver $837.7 million to distressed homeowners of New Jersey from a settlement with major banks. The state had 10.6% of homeowners who are 90 or more days delinquent on their mortgage, the third- highest percentage in the nation at the time. In April 2012, he announced the arrest of three men accused of theft at several Home Depot stores across five states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. They were \\"under-ringing\\" their purchases at self-checkout machines and were charged with more than 500 illegal transactions totaling more than $100,000. In the same month, he announced the arrests of 27 people in a major child pornography incident, that required the involvement of more than 100 law enforcement officers for \\"Operation Watchdog\\". He also filed a lawsuit against John Kot and Gabriel R. DaSilva of leading home improvement companies for defrauding people and breaking several laws. U.S. Senate Chiesa in November 2013, following his departure from the Senate On June 6, 2013, Governor Chris Christie announced that he would appoint Chiesa, a resident of Branchburg, New Jersey, to succeed recently deceased United States Senator Frank Lautenberg.Santora, Marc; and Zernike, Kate. \\"Attorney General of New Jersey Named as Interim Senator\\", The New York Times, June 6, 2013. Accessed June 6, 2013. Chiesa announced that he would not seek election to the seat in the 2013 special election. In the news conference, he said that \\"I'm a conservative Republican, generally speaking.\\" In regard to immigration reform, he stated, \\"I think the first thing we have to do is make sure the borders are secure.\\" Chiesa resigned as Attorney General on June 6, 2013, and Executive Assistant Attorney General John Jay Hoffman became acting Attorney General. Chiesa was sworn into the Senate on June 10, 2013, by Vice President Joe Biden. Chiesa was the first Republican senator to represent New Jersey since 1982 when then- Governor Thomas Kean appointed Nicholas F. Brady to the Senate in order to fill a vacancy; in that case, the seat was subsequently won by Lautenberg for the first time. Chiesa's vote was seen as crucial to the passing of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013. John McCain joked that \\"I'm going to subject him to intense interrogation‚ÄîI may waterboard the guy. Or maybe tell him that he's either going to support this legislation or hire someone to start his car in the morning.\\" He ultimately voted for the bill, which prompted conservative commentator Ann Coulter to proclaim that Christie was \\"dead to me\\" for appointing Chiesa to the Senate. In July 2013, he signed the Mike Lee letter which called for an amendment to the continuing resolution that would defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He opposed Democratic attempts to reinsert funding for the Affordable Care Act but ultimately voted for the Reid- McConnell bill to end the shutdown. He used his time in the Senate to try to draw attention to the issue of human trafficking and, according to The Washington Post, voted with his party 84% of the time. He left the Senate on October 31, 2013 when Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who won the special election, was sworn in. Chiesa recorded a tenure of 129 days, the fourth-shortest of the 65 U.S. Senators who have served in New Jersey's history. Chiesa ruled out the possibility of running for the seat in the regularly scheduled 2014 election, but said he would consider running for office in the future. =Committee assignments= *Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation **Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance *Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs *Committee on Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Atlantic City state takeover Chiesa was appointed by Christie to oversee the state takeover of Atlantic City in 2016.

He was involved in a number of maritime archaeology projects pertaining to historic shipwrecks in Western Australia. Early life Max Cramer was born on 6 July 1934. He grew up on Mt. Fairfax farm near Moonyoonooka, just east of Geraldton in Western Australia. He attended Geraldton Senior High School, leaving at 16 and becoming a builder by trade. In the 1950s he developed an interest in scuba diving, still a novel recreational activity. Cramer was also keen on local history and was aware that the Dutch ship Batavia had been wrecked off the coast of Geraldton, on the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, on 4 June 1629. This calamity had been followed by the infamous Batavia Mutiny. Searchers had been trying to locate the wreck of the Batavia for over 100 years. In fact, they had been searching in the wrong area for most of that period, in the Pelsaert Group, of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands. Co-discovery of wreck of the Batavia Research in the 1950s by Henrietta Drake-Brockman strongly pointed to the Batavia actually lying in the Wallabi Group, 50 kilometres to the north. Based on this theory Cramer and other scuba enthusiasts, such as Hugh Edwards, began diving on the reefs and around the islands there. Then in 1963 a crayfisherman, Pop Martin, unexpectedly dug up a skeleton on one of the islands. That aroused great interest. Then another crayfisherman, Dave Johnson, mentioned to Cramer that he had also seen strange objects under the water nearby, including what might be an anchor and cannons. On 4 June 1963, Max Cramer, his brother Graham Cramer and Greg Allen dived at the spot, Morning Reef. Within minutes they had found the legendary wreck, exactly 334 years to the day of its sinking. The discovery created an international sensation and Cramer's life was irrevocably changed. He became an explorer of wrecks par excellence, in the service of maritime archaeology, and a champion of the rich maritime history and heritage of what is now known as the Batavia Coast. Cramer's role in maritime archaeology The discovery of the Batavia was an event which saw the real commencement of Cramer's long involvement in locating and assisting in the recovery of material from some of Australia's most historic wrecks, often at his own expense. This included the Zeewijk, wrecked in the Pelsaert Group of the Houtman Abrolhos in 1727, which he dived on earlier in 1963, and the Zuytdorp which came to grief when it struck the Zuytdorp Cliffs, 560 kilometres north of Perth, in 1712. Cramer, his brother Graham, and Tom Brady were in fact the first to dive on that wreck, in May 1964. This was a very dangerous undertaking as the wreck sits underwater at the base of a cliff, and it is only calm enough to safely enter the water on a few days each year. Max Cramer also helped to promote research into the fate of all the Dutch seafarers stranded on the coast of Western Australia during the 17th and early 18th centuries.Cramer 1999.Rupert Gerritsen, Cramer and Slee 2003,2005. As an extension of his activities he was co-leader of an expedition to Shark Bay early in 1998 which recovered a bottle, sealed with a French coin, left by Captain Louis de Saint Alo√ºarn of the Gros Ventre in 1772, which had probably contained a document (since disintegrated) claiming possession of Australia for France.Cramer 1999, pp.295‚Äì314According to the Australia on the Map's Landings List database, this was the 40th contact by Europeans with Australia and only the second French ship to visit Australia. Cramer's role in fostering Batavia Coast heritage Max Cramer was also noted for his tireless promotion of the region's early maritime heritage and history. In 1993 he became founding Chair of the Batavia Coast Maritime History Association, and strongly advocated for the housing and display of a proportion of artefacts from the Batavia and other historic wrecks in Geraldton. This led to a purpose-built maritime museum being established in Geraldton, the Geraldton Maritime Museum, possibly the best regional museum in the country. In 2009, as an initiative arising from the Australia on the Map: 1606 ‚Äì 2006 commemorations, marking the 400th anniversary of Australia's first recorded contact with the outside world, Cramer and the Batavia Coast Maritime Heritage Association erected an impressive statue in Geraldton of Wiebbe Hayes, heroic leader of opposition to the Batavia mutineers. Community heritage projects and recognition Other projects initiated by Max Cramer included the erection of a rotunda, which he helped to build, at the Old Lighthouse Keepers Cottage at Bluff Point, to enhance its heritage value. He also helped to inspire the community to build a replica of the Merry-Go-Round by the Sea, the subject of a famous book of the same name by Randolph Stow. As a result of his exploits, activities, initiatives and other forms of participation in the community Max Cramer was twice made Citizen of the Year in Geraldton, in 1979 and 1999. In 2008 he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for \\"service to maritime history and to the community of Geraldton.\\" He died on 3 August 2010, aged 76. Notes References *Max Cramer.

The test was flown in November 2014.\\"Prototype Electronic Warfare Pod Aces First Flight.\\" The pod operates independently of the aircraft's systems, automatically responding to identified threats. One unique aspect of the NGJ is that its AESA array combines EW, coms, radar, and signals intelligence; AESA is known to perform EW and radar, but also handling SIGINT and serving as a communications array are new capabilities. Other than dedicated EW aircraft, the pods can be installed on other platforms like the UCLASS with little modification. The Royal Australian Air Force is contributing $250 million towards the NGJ program, and is directly participating in its development. The first flight test of the mid-band (MB) version of the pod took place on August 7, 2020 aboard an EA-18G out of Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. This flight was intended to prove that the pod could be safely flown aboard the EA-18G. Initial Operating Capability is expected on the MB pod in FY 2022 with a Capability Block 1 contract to be awarded in the fall of 2020. The mid-band and then the low-band pods will supplement the legacy jamming system on the Growlers until the high-band, the last of the three increments, is fielded and the legacy system can be safely retired.

The episode was written by Veena Sud and was directed by Ed Bianchi. In the episode, police question Rosie Larsen's grieving parents. Rosie's best friend, Sterling, and ex-boyfriend, Jasper, enter the suspect list, which leads the detectives to new evidence found at the school. Plot A medical examiner prepares Rosie's body, in order for her parents to view her. As Stan (Brent Sexton) silently identifies his daughter's body, Mitch (Michelle Forbes) turns away and cries. At the police station, Sarah (Mireille Enos) and Holder (Joel Kinnaman) interview the Larsens about the case. Mitch, still in shock, speaks of Rosie's broken fingernails, and Stan describes Rosie as a quiet, family-oriented girl who recently broke up with Jasper Ames. Lieutenant Oakes (Garry Chalk) presents evidence: Rosie's butterfly necklace and a key chain with a bird emblem. Oakes tells Sarah that he needs her for only one more day, asking her to look into the Richmond campaign, adding that campaign car keys were found in the ignition. Sarah urges the Larsens to keep news of Rosie's death to themselves. Stan asks if the detectives will find the killer. Against Sarah's wishes, Holder assures the father. At Richmond's office, Holder asks direct questions about alibis, in contrast to Sarah's restraint. She requests that Richmond (Billy Campbell) not go public with the campaign's involvement in the case. If mentioned, the killer would realize that Rosie's body had been found. Gwen (Kristin Lehman) and Jamie (Eric Ladin) later encourage Richmond to issue an immediate statement, linking the Larsen tragedy to his own wife's death to generate voter sympathy. Richmond refuses. Alone with Gwen, he confides that someone in the campaign office tipped off a reporter about the Yitanes endorsement via e-mail. He orders an internal investigation. Holder tells Sarah that the Richmond campaign reported the car stolen on Saturday morning. Since multiple campaign workers used the vehicle, the keys were left in the ignition for convenience. He later questions Sterling (Kasey Rohl), who says she lost track of Rosie at the dance and assumed she was with Jasper. Meanwhile, Jasper (Richard Harmon) brags to Sarah about picking up \\"some old lady\\" at a bar on Friday night. He then takes out his cell phone, which Sarah confiscates. He tells her that he and Rosie's relationship was brief. Michael Ames (Barclay Hope), Jasper's father, enters and declares the interview over. Alone with his son, Michael smacks him in the face. Back at the station, Holder considers Jasper as the prime suspect, since Jasper could afford to buy Rosie the expensive designer shoes that Rosie wore to the dance. Oakes adds that Jasper was previously arrested for auto theft. At City Hall, Gwen informs Richmond that nothing suspicious was found in staff e-mails, and Jamie reports that no staff members are suspects in Rosie's murder. Yitanes (Lee Garlington) enters, demanding to know the secret she's been asked to hear. Sarah arrives, takes Richmond aside, and promises to make him look good, if he stays quiet until midnight, or to look as though he's obstructing a child-murder investigation, if he doesn't. Richmond agrees, then tells Yitanes about smoking marijuana in college. She laughs and leaves. As they campaign door-to-door, Jamie asks Richmond to tell Yitanes about the Larsen situation, but he considers the issue closed. Richmond secretly meets with Nathan (Peter Benson) to ask if he investigated Gwen's and Jamie's e-mail accounts. Told no, Richmond orders him to do so. While driving to the Yitanes endorsement, Richmond receives a call from a reporter requesting confirmation about Rosie and the campaign car. In a girls' bathroom at the high school, Sarah discovers Rosie's name scratched in a mirror with a line of Xs across it. Smoking outside the school, Holder is approached by two girls who ask if it's marijuana. He offers them a smoke. After he asks about campus party places, one girl mentions a hideaway known as \\"The Cage.\\" Holder locates the secret room in an abandoned boarded-off area of the school basement. Back at the station, Lieutenant Oakes gives Sarah highlights from the coroner's report. The time of death is unclear, however Rosie was alive when the car hit the water because she ripped off her fingernails trying to claw out. Sarah reminds her boss that she's not staying, but later arrives at The Cage. Holder states that it's where the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Halloween party occurred. Sarah surveys the scene, seeing a blood-soaked mattress, a witch's hat like Rosie's, and bloody handprints on the wall. Production In an interview with Mina Hochberg at AMCTV.com, Brent Sexton spoke about the difficulty in portraying Stan Larsen: \\"Stan's the kind of guy that, once he knows it's his daughter and he has his breakdown and rage at the site where they found her, from that point on he's decided to put his family first. He's decided to be the rock for his family and essentially suppresses his own grief. So during the morgue scene, yes, [emotion] definitely wants to come out. However, he won't let it happen.\\" Reception Critics paired their reviews with the Pilot episode, but, nonetheless, gave favorable reviews. Teresa L. at TV Fanatic rated the episodes 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \\"This was a great, but long, start to the season. It's an intriguing premise to focus a crime series around a single crime and the effects of that crime and I think it will make for a very entertaining show.\\" The A.V. Club's Meredith Blake rated the first two episodes an A‚Äì and commented, \\"At this early stage, it's hard to know whether The Killing will live up to AMC's aspirations and become The Next Great American Television Show, but, with a mystery this engrossing, who really cares?\\" Coupled with the Pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\" drew 2.7 million viewers and a 2 household rating.

It is an aroma chemical which is a minor constituent of the aroma of the rose (Rosa damascene). Rosefuran is a 2,3-disubstituted furan (3-methyl-2-(3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl)furan). It has an odor threshold of 200 ppb and constitutes 0.16% of Bulgarian rose oil. Rosefuran has been established as a female sex pheromone of an acarid mite, Caloglyphus sp. Concentrations of less than 100 ng of synthetic rosefuran caused sexual excitation in males of the species.  Synthesis  Rosefuran was synthesized in 1968 by George B√ºchi via the organomercury compound bis(3-methyl-2-furyl)mercury. Rosefuran has been synthesized in many steps from common starting materials starting with prenyl chloride (3-methyl-but-2-en-1-yl chloride). Rosefuran has also been synthesized via cyclization of suitable acyclic precursors, such as, 5-oxogeraniol and 5-hydroxycitral (4-hydoxy-3,7-dimethyl-(E)-2,6-octadienol). Rosefuran has also been prepared via palladium catalyzed cross coupling of the methyl ester of 4-bromo-5-methyl-2-furancarboxylic acid followed by decarboxylation. Alternatively, rosefuran has been prepared from other furan derivatives. Thus, Wittig reaction of 3-methyl-2-furanacetaldehyde with triphenylphosphonium isopropylide gave rosefuran in 67% yield. The aldehyde was obtained via Claisen rearrangement of 3-(vinyloxymethyl)furan. Similarly, the readily available 3-bromofuran was reacted with 3,3-dimethylallyl bromide and lithium diisopropylamide in THF solution, followed by reaction at with methyl iodide and N-butyllithium in THF, yielding rosefuran. A patented process for the manufacture of rosefuran via condensation of 3-formylpropionic acid methyl ester with crotonaldehyde has been described. The intermediate ketoaldehyde is cyclized to a furan derivative which is converted to rosefuran in 33% overall yield via Grignard reaction to give 2-methyl-4-(3-methyl-2-furanyl)-2-butanol followed by dehydration.Hidetaka Tsukasa, \\"Manufacture of rosefuran\\", Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho, 03151373 (1991)  Applications  Rosefuran is a desirable component of rose oil, a natural fragrance material. Rosefuran is the major constituent (58% by weight) of the essential oil of Perilla ocimoides, a herbaceous, annual plant cultivated in Bangladesh and used as a component of a common spice. Additionally, synthetic rosefuran is recommended (average recommended level in parentheses) for use as a flavor, fragrance chemical for a wide variety of applications including baked goods (5 ppm), breakfast cereal (2 ppm), cheese (3 ppm), condiments (2 ppm), frozen dairy (3 ppm), soups (2 ppm) and snack foods (5 ppm).rosefuran: http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1435551.html  References  Category:Furans ","title":"Rosefuran"},{"id":"34500018","text":"Dorcadion scopolii is a species of longhorn beetle in the subfamily Lamiinae.

Vance was born in Oakland, California. She went to high school in Ecuador and attended university in the United States. After attending Williams College for her undergraduate degree and earning a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley, she returned to Ecuador in 2004. Vance is openly lesbian. She spent time in Europe as a girl, where, at the age of thirteen, she and her first girlfriend were attacked by homophobic youths. Vance had already begun to understand and accept her identity as a lesbian, but said that this incident \\"was not only a discovery of my homosexuality, but also society's reaction to it.\\" She subsequently worked as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activist and was the executive director of Fundacion Causana, a lesbian rights organization. Vance was appointed to the Cabinet by President Rafael Correa in January 2012, after her predecessor David Chiriboga resigned amid concerns that he was unable to fix the problems in Ecuador's national healthcare system. Vance announced her intent to shut down a system of religious \\"clinics\\" which said they could \\"cure\\" gays and particularly lesbians of their homosexuality and which had been reported to torture inmates physically and psychologically and to hold them against their will. Fundacion Causana had been working to close these sorts of institutions for ten years. When a network of almost 200 such illegal \\"clinics\\" was discovered four years earlier, Vance's organization and other LGBT rights and progressive organizations pressured Correa's government to shut them down. This led to the closure of thirty such clinics in September 2011 and a plan, presented by Chiriboga before his resignation, to continue the work. Soon after Vance was appointed to the Cabinet, the ministry raided three of the \\"torture clinics\\" near Quito and rescued dozens of women.

Incubate the broth at 35 ¬∞C for 48‚Äì72 hours. After incubation add 5 drops of Methyl Red directly into the broth, through the sides of the tube. = Interpretation = The development of stable red color in the surface of the medium indicates sufficient acid production to lower the pH to 4.4 and constitute a positive test. Since other organism may produce lesser quantities of acid from the test substrate, an intermediate orange color between yellow and red may develop. This does not indicate positive test. = Controls = Positive and negative controls should be run after preparation of each lot of medium. Positive control: Escherichia coli Negative control: Klebsiella  Voges Proskauer test  = Principle = It is used to determine the ability of some organisms to produce a neutral end product, acetyl methyl carbinol (acetoin) from glucose fermentation. The production of acetoin, a neutral reacting end product produced by members such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter etc., is the chief end product of glucose metabolism and form less quantities of mixed acids.

The painting is Rossetti's only treatment in oil of a contemporary moral subject, urban prostitution, and although the work remained incomplete at Rossetti's death in 1882, he always considered it one of his most important works, returning to it many times from the mid-1850s until the year before his death.Treuherz et al. (2004), pp. 165‚Äì66 History Unlike the majority of Rossetti's work of the 1850s, which were small-scale drawings and watercolours characterised by medieval and early Renaissance revivalism, Found was Rossetti's only attempt at a contemporary subject, prostitution, that was done in oils.Treuherz et al. (2003), p. 24 Rossetti had addressed the topic of prostitution as early as 1847 in letters to his friend William Bell Scott, who wrote the poem Rosabell in 1846 (later known as Maryanne) on the topic. The Gate of Memory, a drawing Rossetti made c. 1854, shows a scene from Rosabell where a prostitute is beginning her evening of work, and views a group of innocent girls \\"still at play\\" dancing. The drawing may have been intended to illustrate the poem in a book, but was painted as a larger watercolour in 1857, which was repainted in 1864.Waking Dreams, pp. 170‚Äì172. In 1870 Rossetti published a sympathetic poem about a prostitute, Jenny. The Gate of Memory, c. 1854 The artist Alexander Munro's maid Ellen Frazer may have posed for an early head-study for the fallen country girl of Found,Marsh (1994), p. 84 and an ink-and-wash study of the composition (now in the British Museum) is dated 1853. Rossetti began work on the painting in the autumn of 1854; this is probably the unfinished version now in Carlisle. On 30 September 1853 Rossetti wrote to his mother and sister describing the type of wall, cart and calf that he wished for them to find as models so that he could begin the painting. The unfinished Carlisle version consists only of these three elements, plus the head of Fanny Cornforth, apparently added later. Ford Madox Brown noted in his diary Rossetti's difficulties in painting the calf in November 1854, \\"he paints it in all like Albert Durer (sic) hair by hair & seems incapable of any breadth ... From want of habit I see nature bothers him‚Äîbut it is sweetly drawn & felt.\\"The letter and the diary quoted in Waking Dreams, pp. 172‚Äì174. The calf's role in the painting is two-fold. First, it explains why the farmer has come to the city. But more importantly, its situation as \\"an innocent animal trapped and on its way to be sold\\" parallels the woman's and raises questions on the woman's state of mind. \\"Is the prostitute rejecting salvation or is she accepting it; or is she repentant but unable to escape her fate, like the calf?\\"Found, Walker Art Gallery, 2003. Retrieved 27 January 2012. In 1855, Rossetti described his work-in-progress in a letter to William Holman Hunt: Study for the head of the girl, 1858. Ink on paper. Model: Fanny Cornforth. (Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) The motto from Jeremiah 2:2 reads \\"I remember Thee; the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothal.\\" and appears on two early compositional studies. Rossetti replaced the word \\"espousal\\" in the motto as he found it with \\"betrothal\\", which he felt better translated the sense of the original Hebrew. In 1858, Rossetti met Fanny Cornforth, who soon became his mistress. She later described how he invited her to his studio and \\"put my head against the wall and drew it for the head of the calf picture\\".Marsh (1994), p. 84 He made several pen and ink drawings about this time of the heads of both the male and female subjects. A version in oils was commissioned in 1859 by James Leathart, and this version, with the face of Fanny Cornforth, is the painting now in the Delaware Art Museum. Rossetti struggled with Found, abandoning and returning to it intermittently until at least 1881, and leaving it unfinished at his death. His assistants Henry Treffry Dunn and Frederic Shields both helped with the painting, and Dunn and Edward Burne-Jones may have worked on it after Rossetti's death. Rossetti published a poem, also titled \\"Found\\", as a companion to the painting in 1881 in the volume Ballads and Sonnets. 400px Studies Study for Found, dated 1853. Black and brown ink with white heightening on paper. (The British Museum) A number of studies for Found have survived. The earliest may be the black and brown ink sketch now in the British Museum, which is signed and dated 1853. The Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery has a compositional sketch in pen and black ink dated to 1854‚Äì55 as well as a pen and ink drawing of the head of the girl modelled by Fanny Cornforth. Ownership and exhibitions The painting was first commissioned by Francis McCracken but the commission was dropped because of lack of progress on the painting. Next James Leathart, then William Graham commissioned the work. Graham only took possession of the unfinished work after Rossetti's death. Graham's estate sold the work in 1886, presumably to Frederick Richards Leyland and it was sold again at Leyland's estate sale, held at Christie's on 28 May 1892.Waking Dreams, p. 172. Samuel Bancroft, a textile mill owner from Wilmington, Delaware, bought the painting at the estate sale. He bought at least four other Rossetti paintings at the same time and later accumulated one of the largest collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside of the United Kingdom. Found is considered the most important picture in Bancroft's extensive collection and was prominently displayed above Bancroft's desk in his home.Waking Dreams, pp. 172, 27. The Bancroft estate donated the collection in 1935 to the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington. The painting was exhibited in London in 1883, at Rossetti's memorial exhibition, and again in 1892. Following the 1883 exhibition at the Royal Academy, Lewis Carroll noted that the farmer's face showed a combination \\"of pain and pity, condemnation and love, which is one of the most marvellous things I have ever seen done in painting.\\"from Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, 1898, p. 225, quoted in Waking Dreams, p. 175. While Bancroft's house in Wilmington was being expanded to hold his new paintings in 1892, Found was exhibited in nearby Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in New York at the Century Club.Waking Dreams, p.35. It has also been exhibited in London and Birmingham (1973), New Haven (1976), Richmond, Virginia (1982), and in London, Liverpool, Moscow (2013) and Amsterdam (2003).Waking Dreams, p.172.

The confrontation ended without fatalities, but provoked the retaliatory Burning of Falmouth five months later. Falmouth is now known as Portland, Maine, but Maine was part of Massachusetts at the time. Spruce trees carried in the boats of Samuel Thompson's militia inspired this Naval Ensign of Massachusetts. Background Brunswick, Maine tavern owner Samuel Thompson had been elected to the Brunswick Board of selectmen in 1768, 1770, and 1771. He was elected commander of the Brunswick militia in 1774 and headed the local enforcement committee for the Continental Association created by the First Continental Congress to boycott all goods from Great Britain. The Continental Association attempted to enforce the boycott on 2 March 1775 against a shipload of sail, rope, and rigging for loyalist shipbuilder Captain Samuel Coulson of Portland by demanding the delivery ship leave port. Coulson requested delay while the English sloop completed needed repairs after its trans-Atlantic voyage. HMS Canceaux was dispatched from Boston while the repairs were in progress; and, following its arrival on March 29, Coulson proceeded to offload his British goods under the protection of the British warship.Leamon, James S. Revolution Downeast: The War for American Independence in Maine (1995) University of Massachusetts Press pp.62-67 The battles of Lexington and Concord took place 90 miles (150 km) to the south while Canceaux lay at anchor in Casco Bay. When news of the battle reached Brunswick on April 21, the Brunswick militia laid plans to capture Canceaux.Goold, William The Burning of Falmouth 19 February 1873 Militia mobilized Fifty Brunswick militiamen wearing a sprig of spruce in their hats as a uniform arrived in Portland secretly aboard small boats carrying a spruce tree with the lower branches cleared away as a battle ensign. Canceaux was prepared to prevent the small boats from boarding; but Thompson's militia captured the warship's captain, Lieutenant Henry Mowat, on 9 May 1775 while he was ashore arranging church services for his crew. The first lieutenant aboard Canceaux discharged two cannon salutes (gunpowder charges without shot) toward Portland and threatened to shell Portland unless the captain was released. Six hundred militiamen from surrounding communities gathered as Portland residents negotiated to prevent their community from becoming a battleground. Mowat was allowed to return to his ship, but his demand to arrest Thompson was refused, and the assembled militia forced Canceaux to leave port on May 15. Aftermath Disappointed militiamen vented their frustration by looting the homes of Coulson and loyalist Sheriff Tyng before returning to their inland communities. News of Thompson's attempt encouraged Machias, Maine militiamen to capture the British armed schooner Margaretta a month later in the battle of Machias. Mowat brought Canceaux back to Portland in October to set fires which left Portland's population homeless as winter approached. The Massachusetts House of Representatives promoted Samuel Thompson to Brigadier of the Cumberland County, Maine militia on 8 February 1776 in recognition of his initiative following the battles of Lexington and Concord; and the spruce trees his men carried provided inspiration for adoption of the Pine Tree Flag as the Massachusetts naval ensign in April 1776. Thompson moved to Topsham, Maine in 1783, and was regularly elected to the Massachusetts General Court until his death in 1798 at the age of 63. Thompson donated part of his significant real estate holdings to Bowdoin College when the school was chartered in 1794.Norton, Lewis Arthur Bowdoin's Revolutionary War Benefactor in Bowdoinsider Winter, 2007 p.11 References Category:1775 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Conflicts in 1775 Category:Maine in the American Revolution Category:Boston campaign Category:History of Portland, Maine ","title":"Thompson's War"},{"id":"34500084","title":"List of historical guests of Planetary Radio"},{"id":"34500103","text":"Syssphinx is a genus of moths of the family Saturniidae.

Prelude In August 2011 Peter O'Neill became the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea (PNG). At this time Sir Michael Somare was recovering from sickness, and his family had announced that he had resigned from both the Prime Ministership and parliament. In December 2011 the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that Somare's removal from office was unlawful, and directed that he be reinstated. This led to a political standoff, during which Somare asked the commander of the PNGDF, Brigadier General Francis Agwi, to intervene. Agwi refused to do so, and endorsed O'Neill. O'Neill was supported by most members of Parliament, and retained the position. At some point following these events, Somare and his cabinet took the decision to replace Agwi with the retired PNGDF officer Colonel Yaura Sasa. Sasa had served as the defence attache in Papua New Guinea's embassy in Indonesia before retiring from the military. Mutiny At 3:00 am on 26 January about 20 soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Royal Pacific Islands Regiment (1 RPIR) took Agwi and two other officers deemed to be loyal to O'Neill prisoner after overpowering guards at Taurama Barracks outside of PNG's capital of Port Moresby. Several shots were fired during this operation. The party then transported Agwi to Murray Barracks near the centre of the city where he was placed under house arrest. At a press conference held on 26 January, Sasa claimed that his actions were not a coup or mutiny as he had been appointed to lead the PNGDF by Somare. He called upon Governor General Sir Michael Ogio to reinstate Somare. He also stated that \\"I once again am now calling on... both parties and the head of state to respect the constitution and comply with the orders issued by the supreme court immediately\\" and \\"If this call is not heeded, I may be forced to take necessary actions\\". PNG's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Belden Namah stated in separate press conference that Sasa was not supported by most of the PNGDF, and that 15 of his supporters had been arrested. At this time the total number of military personnel supporting the colonel was stated to be about 30. Namah claimed that Sasa's actions constituted treason and called upon him to surrender. In response to reports that Somare had ordered the mutiny, Namah stated that Somare had \\"lost sanity\\". In a statement issued via his daughter on 26 January, Somare defended his decision to order the mutiny. He argued that the mutiny was legitimate as O'Neill and his supporters were \\"illegally holding on to power\\". He also stated that \\"We cannot allow this situation to continue where a rogue government commandeers the disciplinary forces\\" and \\"It is incumbent on the police and army to comply with the orders of the supreme court and support the legitimate government, which is the minority Somare/Agiru government\\". In the evening of 26 January O'Neill told the media that the mutiny had ended. He stated that Agwi had been freed and Sasa was being \\"dealt with\\". The soldiers who supported Sasa had withdrawn to Taurama Barracks. Many businesses in Port Moresby closed on 26 January in response to the mutiny. An Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter in the city stated that the atmosphere there was \\"tense\\". All domestic flights in PNG were also cancelled in an apparent attempt to prevent other soldiers travelling to Port Moresby. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement warning Australians to \\"limit travel around Port Moresby\\". New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a similar warning. Aftermath The mutineers at Taurama Barracks were still armed on 27 January, and had announced that they would retain their weapons until they received a pardon. At this time, Sasa was reported to be in the barracks' officers mess. A spokesman for the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary was reported to have said that the force did not intend to arrest Sasa, as his conduct was a matter for the military. Sasa was also reported to be seeking a pardon. Due to the intensification of the political crisis following the mutiny, the PNG Government's credit rating was downgraded from stable to negative by ratings agency Standard & Poor's. Sasa was arrested by police officers on the night of 28 January and charged with mutiny. At this time he was staying in a house in the suburb of Boroko. On 29 January Somare issued a statement in which he called upon police and the PNGDF to support the supreme court ruling in relation to the prime ministership. On 30 January, the soldiers who participated in the mutiny surrendered their weapons to Namah following a parade at Taurama Barracks. The Defence Minister gave a speech to about 200 members of 1 RPIR, including the 30 mutineers, during which he stated that the soldiers who had taken party in the mutiny would receive an amnesty later that afternoon. He threatened that personnel who participated in any further mutinies would \\"face the full brunt of the law\\", however. Sasa was released on bail on 1 February. The charge against Sasa was struck out by the Committal Court on 1 August 2012 on the grounds that police prosecutors had not submitted any evidence to substantiate it. The mutiny on 26 January was the second military mutiny to have taken place in PNG. The first occurred on 28 July 1997 when the PNGDF's Special Forces Unit occupied Murray Barracks.

He is credited for identifying the first coal ball in the United States in 1922, which renewed interest in them. He also developed a method of peeling coal balls using nitrocellulose. Many of the paleobotanical materials owned by the University of Chicago's Walker Museum were provided by No√©, where he was also a curator of fossil plants. He was also a research associate at the Field Museum of Natural History, where he assisted with their reconstruction of a Carboniferous forest. Biography =Early years= From 1894 to 1897, No√© attended the University of Graz, studying paleobotany under Constantin von Ettingshausen. After Ettinghausen's death, No√© moved to Germany in 1897, having been transferred to the University of G√∂ttingen. While a young man, No√© served briefly in the cavalry as a member of the 8th Austrian Hussars.Adolf Carl No√©, Golden Days of Soviet Russia. Chicago: Thomas S. Rockwell Co., 1927; biographical information on inside dust jacket flap. He studied there until 1899, when he moved to the United States. During that year, No√© began his work at the University of Chicago. He obtained a B. A. in 1900. Later in that year No√© married the former Mary Evelyn Cullatin. The pair had two daughters, Mary Helen No√© (who later married Nobel laureate Robert S. Mulliken) and Valerie No√©. In 1901, he moved to California to teach German at Stanford University. Four years later, in 1905, No√© earned a Ph.D. in Germanic Languages and Literatures. No√© taught at the University of Chicago from the 1910s, continuing his interest in the mounted soldiery as member of the 1st Illinois Cavalry in 1915 and 1916, during which he attended training camps at Fort Sheridan and Plattsburg. Near the end of World War I, No√© removed \\"von Archenegg\\" from his name to avoid anti-German sentiment. No√© also stopped teaching German classes to research paleobotany, due to overstaffing and the public's disinterest in taking the German courses. Following the war, No√© participated in reconstruction efforts in his native Austria, work for which he was awarded a gold medal from the University of Vienna and the gold cross of honor from the government of the Republic of Austria. =Paleobotanical work= A coal ball No√© became a geologist for the Allan and Garcia Coal Commission in the Soviet Union in 1927, ten years after the October Revolution. There, in the Donetz coal basin, No√© did work as a mining geologist, where he fulfilled a contract granted by the Soviet government assessing the state of coal production in the region. Upon his return to the United States he published a memoir of his journey, Golden Days of Soviet Russia. In 1934, No√© became the Field Museum of Natural History's research associate, and assisted in the construction of a Pennsylvanian coal swamp there. =Studies on coal balls= Coal balls in North America were found in Iowa coal seams since the 1890s, although the connection to European coal balls was not made until No√© (whose coal ball was actually found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. There was some disbelief over No√©'s discovery. For instance, in 1922, No√© was contacted by David White, who strongly believed that coal balls could not be found in North America. No√© later managed to convince him otherwise by showing him a wheelbarrow full of Illinois coal balls, after which White never spoke to No√© again. =Death= While translating the final chapter of a publication about coal in his office, No√© suffered a paralytic stroke on March 11, 1939. He died on the morning of April 10, five months before his planned retirement date of October 1939.

It was first broadcast on USA Network in the United States on January 24, 2012. The episode was directed by Russell Lee Fine and written by Alexandra McNally and Jim Campolongo. The episode features several themes of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and contains various allusions to Shakespearean and Victorian-era literature. After a student (Graham Phillips) at a prestigious prep school approaches Peter Burke and Neal Caffrey about missing scholarship funds, they begin investigating the father (Dylan Baker) of the boy's crush (Elizabeth Gillies). According to the Nielsen ratings system, an estimated 3.472 million household viewers watched the original broadcast of the episode, with 1.1 million in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Upper West Side Story\\" received positive reviews. Plot Neal (Matt Bomer) and Peter (Tim DeKay) are approached by Evan Leary (Graham Phillips), a student at the prestigious Manhattan Preparatory Academy. Evan explains that he believes the money from his scholarship fund was embezzled by a rich investor by the name of Andy Woods (Dylan Baker). Peter quickly takes the case, realizing that Woods is already believed to be associated with a major cartel. Peter visits the school under the guise of the parent of a potential student. Neal is to pose as his assistant, but he instead takes on the role of a substitute English teacher after learning that both Evan and Woods' 15-year-old daughter Chloe (Elizabeth Gillies), are in the class. Woods soon discovers that Peter may not be who he says he is after learning that he lied about his hotel arrangements; Peter covers for this by admitting that he spent the night with his mistress. Later, Neal tells Mozzie (Willie Garson) about Evan's silent attraction to Chloe, and that he plans to set them up using a sonnet. Peter discovers that Woods may be working with Graham Slater (John Rothman), the school's headmaster, in order to embezzle the funds. The following day, at the school, Neal sees Slater drop an envelope into Chloe's locker. In order to check the contents of the envelope, Peter pulls the fire alarm. Neal finds the school's quarterly finance report inside. Chloe later asks Neal to tutor her at home; he accepts and invites Evan to come as well. Woods invites Peter to dinner the same night, and asks that he bring his mistress along as well. Diana (Marsha Thomason), posing as Peter's mistress, accompanies Peter, and, while there, stages a quarrel. Peter, feigning frustration, opens a door to exit, setting off an alarm in the process. Woods turns the alarm off; this allows Neal to easily break into his office and clone Woods' hard drive. Chloe follows Neal into her father's office and accidentally pocket dials Woods. Realizing something is wrong, Woods goes downstairs to his office and discovers Neal with Chloe. Evan quickly enters, taking the blame for the mistake. The next day, Evan lets Neal know that Woods suspects something. Peter is taken hostage by Woods and held in the shop classroom, where Woods quickly discovers that Peter is with the FBI. Neal takes Chloe's phone and calls Woods, forcing him to step out of the room. Neal and Mozzie create a smokescreen out of lab chemicals and free Peter; Diana meanwhile arrests Woods. Neal explains to Chloe that her life will not be easy, and she begins a relationship with Evan after discovering roses and the sonnet left by Neal and Mozzie. Later, Peter must give a statement to the commutation committee about Neal's involvement with the Keller case. Although Neal's actions had caused the kidnapping of Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen), Peter opts to omit the details surrounding Neal's theft of the art. Production The episode was written by Alexandra McNally and Jim Campolongo. It was McNally's fifth episode since joining the series during the second season, and Campolongo's sixth overall. It was their first time to collaborate on an episode. \\"Upper West Side Story\\" was directed by Russell Lee Fine, his third directing credit for the series after the episodes \\"Payback\\" and \\"On Guard\\". Working titles for the episode included \\"Well Endowed\\" and \\"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\\". It was first reported on July 11, 2011 that Dylan Baker and Elizabeth Gillies would appear in an episode of White Collar as Andy Woods and his daughter. Other guest stars to appear in the episode include Graham Phillips. Series star Tim DeKay stated that he enjoyed working on the episode, in part because it was primarily a standalone. Bomer said, speaking of \\"Upper West Side Story\\", that he enjoys portraying different aspects of Neal's undercover roles. Bomer stated that he received a phone call from Campolongo requesting that he memorize a Byron poem by the next morning. The poem was ultimately included in a scene in which Neal is teaching an English class. Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club pointed out that the episode contained various references to Shakespearian and Victorian-era literature, specifically mentioning Romeo and Juliet. He stated that these metaphors helped move the plot forward. Reception Dylan Baker's performance as Andy Woods was met with mixed reactions from critics. =Ratings= The initial broadcast of the episode drew 3.472 million viewers, and earned a 1.1 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Upper West Side Story\\" ranked seventh place among cable series for the night in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and fourth in its timeslot, surpassed by Teen Mom 2, Storage Wars, and The Game. The original broadcast of the episode overlapped with the 2012 State of the Union Address for the first 17 minutes; however, viewership for the episode increased slightly from the previous week. =Reviews= \\"Upper West Side Story\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many praising the mostly standalone format and the rebuilding of Neal and Peter's relationship. Morgan Glennon of the Huffington Post called the episode \\"a really fun undercover romp that still deals with the fallout between Neal and Peter.\\" Michelle Carlbert stated that she \\"felt like it put Neal and Peter back on track\\" and that she enjoyed the standalone case. Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com said that \\"this is an episode that reminds me why I fell in love with White Collar.\\" Frederick compared the episode to \\"Mr. Monk Goes Back to School\\", an episode of USA Network's Monk; she likened Baker's character to that of Andrew McCarthy's in Monk, stating that as a villain, McCarthy was evil yet endearing, while Baker appeared genuinely evil. She also praised the series for utilizing comedy rather than drama. Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club gave the episode a more mixed review, stating that while the series was \\"at its caper-hatching best,\\" it was \\"also its most excessively ludicrous.\\" Like Frederick, Herzog praised the use of comedy, though he felt that Baker appeared to be more like \\"a cartoon bully.\\" He ultimately gave the episode a B-.

Gentrification in Vancouver has taken place in the context of a strong environmental movement, high land prices, real estate development, and the development of former industrial sites owned by the City of Vancouver or whose redevelopment was influenced by city zoning regulationQuastel, N. (2009). Political ecologies of gentrification. Urban Geography, 30(7), 694-725. Historically, Vancouver's geographic location has made it the transportation hub connecting Western Canada to Asia. This enriched the area with raw materials and led to a booming manufacturing industry centered on the Canadian Pacific Railway networks. Numerous warehouses, timber mills, rail yard facilities and wartime industries were constructed in easy-to-access areas like Coal Harbour and False Creek. Working-class neighbourhoods were established in surrounding areas like Kitsilano, Strathcona and Grandview‚ÄìWoodland. However, in the 1950s the area entered a period of decline, caused largely by the growing prominence of freight trucking and new industrial complexes such as Annacis Island being built on relatively cheap suburban land close to the freeways. This created rent-gap theory conditions and eventual gentrification in several inner-city Vancouver neighbourhoods. Early gentrification Gentrification in Vancouver has occurred differently in many of its districts. Changes in the area of Kitsilano in the 1960s and 1970s were among the first to gentrify. The neighbourhood was a traditionally a working-class residential neighbourhood during Vancouver's industrial days. Following the decline of heavy industry, as workers moved out, the area's low rent and proximity to downtown Vancouver, the high quality of life due to its closeness to Vancouver's beaches, and the nearby University of British Columbia made it attractive for artists and students. It subsequently became the heart of the city's counterculture movement, giving rise to Greenpeace in 1970. As the area became more artistic and vibrant, innovative young professionals began making improvements to the area's old wood-frame houses. The city came under pressure to halt the expansion of high-rise buildings, which were becoming commonplace across English Bay in what is known as the West End. David Ley argues that this direct action to halt the spread of gentrification actually worsened the effects, as the city down-zoned Kitsilano and homemade improvement loans were easily available. The lower density, tree- lined streets, access to the beach and downtown and relative ease of renovation made the area an attractive place for young professionals, which caused housing demand and prices to increase.Ley, David and Dobson, Cory. \\"Are There Limits to Gentrification? The Contexts of Impeded Gentrification in Vancouver.\\" Urban Stud 2008 45: page 2471. Oct 13, 2008. . Available at http://usj.sagepub.com/content/45/12/2471 This cycle of improvement and rising property prices has transformed the area into a trendy strip for the city's growing class of \\"yuppies\\". Production-side gentrification Other areas of Vancouver, such as the north and south shores of False Creek, tend to follow the production-side model of gentrification. Here, investors and city planners saw a rent gap between current and potential property value if the land was redeveloped, and decided to capitalize on this. Investment on the north shore of False Creek skyrocketed before and after Expo 86, which had previously been abandoned on rail and industrial land. Hong Kong real estate developer Li Ka- shing, the primary shareholder of Concord Pacific Developments, was the first major foreign developer in the area and paved the way for a influx of Asian investment in prominent urban property following the British transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China. Concord Pacific developed a series of mid to high-rise mixed-residential buildings that fit well with the city's vision of a livable downtown. These residential buildings featured high density, proximity to amenities and ample parks and walkways along the waterfront. This trend has been replicated across the downtown core, particularly on the opposing south side of False Creek, where the Olympic Village for the 2010 Winter Olympics was built. This architectural style has been dubbed \\"Vancouverism\\", and has helped Vancouver acquire the title of \\"the world's most livable city\\" five years in a row‚Äîthough none of these indices include the cost of living, which Vancouver also tops.Vancouver is the world's most livable city for a fifth straight year: survey  National Post.

Most notably, the Downtown Eastside (DTES), known colloquially as, \\"Canada's poorest postal code\\",Baker, Linda. \\"Amid Gentrification, Vancouver Seeks Balance.\\" Architectural Record 196.1 (2008): 18. Business Source Complete. Web. 5 Nov. 2012. has opposed gentrification at every turn. David Ley has examined why gentrification seems to have completely neglected this section of the city, which begins just blocks from Vancouver's ultra-high value financial district. He attributes this to a combination of local resistance, led by the Downtown Eastside Residents Association, a large amount of available social housing and, \\"a street scene that has proved too raw for most middle-class sensibilities\\".Ley, page 2481 An example of opposing visions of the DTES was the replacement of the Woodward's Building, which was once the premier shopping centre in Vancouver, but was vacant from 1993 and consequently demolished in 2006. After much debate the new building was constructed with mixed commercial, market-priced condos and social housing. Though arguments have suggested that the redeveloped space would not affect the surrounding areas and that these projects would include social housing, opponents of the development claim that after a few projects, it would result in a lot of inhabitants being displaced, and possibly push out social services that create no revenue for the city, such as safe injection sites. Jean Swanson of the Carnegie Community Action Project reported that Chinatown potentially offers services to thousands of low-income Chinese seniors who commute daily to Chinatown to shop, and that by developing it for a different class, it would take away the independence and comfort that many seniors still grasp onto.Drury, Ivan. \\"Low-income Chinatown Residents Unite Against the Towers.\\" Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood Council.

The house is located in Delafield, Wisconsin, and was built in 1846. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1984, for its religious significance. David Jackson Kemper was born in New York in 1789 and trained for the Episcopal ministry in Philadelphia. After ordination in 1811, he served as a missionary in then sparsely populated western Pennsylvania and Ohio for 20 years. In 1834 he was assigned to assess conditions at a mission school further west, in Green Bay. A year later, he was made the first \\"missionary bishop,\\" and charged with organizing the church in Missouri and Indiana. In 1838, his mandate was expanded to include Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. Kemper traveled constantly through these half-settled areas. His tasks included organizing Episcopal congregations and finding clergymen to serve them. With In 1842 Kemper established Nashotah House near Delafield, which became the Episcopal Church's western seminary. He considered building a \\"rather grand\\" home for himself on Lake Nemahbin, but decided that was too financially risky, so instead in 1846 he bought a parcel two miles from Nashotah and began to expand an already-existing building into what would become his home, Bishopstead. His wife had died before he came west, but now he brought from the east to Wisconsin Territory his two sons, his daughter, and two unmarried sisters to live with him. That pre-existing building was probably built around 1842. Kemper added to it by the winter of 1846 and continued adding over the years. Today the west wing is a two-story stone building with a chimney at each end of the roof - suggesting Federal style. Inside, the walls are mainly plaster and the flooring is pine. The east wing is a two-story frame structure with Greek Revival stylings, and its parlor has French doors and a fireplace with a Gothic mantle. Kemper added other wings in his day. Kemper's house was his home base as he organized the early Episcopal church in what would become states ranging from Indiana to Minnesota to Kansas. In 1859 he resigned from his post as missionary bishop, but he continued to live in this house, remained Bishop of Wisconsin, and stayed active in church affairs at the national level until he died in 1870.

Flora of North America. and shortfruit willow. Distribution The plant is native to North America, where it occurs throughout Alaska except for the Aleutian Islands and southeastern coastal region, in western and northern Canada, and in the contiguous United States in the Rocky Mountains south to Colorado, and the Sierra Nevada in California. It grows in several types of habitat. It grows in coniferous forests and alpine habitat types, near rivers and streams, in bogs, muskegs, swamps, and moraines. It is common on floodplains, where it grows with other willow species and various shrubs. It can also be found on serpentine barrens, salt marshes, and salt flats. It easily colonizes wet places recently cleared of vegetation, such as gravel bars. Description Salix brachycarpa is a shrub is low in stature or sometimes prostrate, growing up to tall. The stems are sometimes hairy and the smaller branchlets may be quite woolly. The leaves are also usually hairy, with woolly undersides. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate plants. The inflorescence is a catkin up to 5 centimeters long. The plant produces tiny, downy seeds which are viable for just a few days but may germinate within 12 hours of hitting a suitable substrate. =Varieties= There are at least two recognized varieties of this species of willow: * Salix brachycarpa var. brachycarpa is the typical variety. * Salix brachycarpa var. niphoclada is considered the arctic variety. * Salix brachycarpa var. psammophila, a variety endemic to the Lake Athabasca sand dunes in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.Salix brachycarpa Nuttall var. psammophila Raup. Flora of North America. A former subspecies, Salix brachycarpa subsp. niphoclada, is now synonymous with Salix niphoclada, another Alaskan willow species that is also commonly referred to as barren-ground willow. Of note, barren-ground willow is also the common name of a third but distinct species of willow found in Alaska, Salix nummularia. Uses On the Alaska North Slope, sites that supported this and other low-growing willow species before being disturbed for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were observed to have been recolonized by low-growing willows, including Salix brachycarpa, within four years after disturbance ceased. Natural regeneration of this and other low- growing willows was successful on moist riparian sites with silty soils, where they were mixed with the taller Alaska willow (Salix alaxensis), and on dry sites with fine-textured soils. This willow provides food for moose in interior Alaska, and it has been planted to restore moose habitat in the Alaska North Slope. It is also planted in revegetation efforts and as a windbreak. S. brachycarpa is one of the few willows native to North America popularly in commercial cultivation.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yulia_Kuzovkina/publication/237532641_Ornamental_willows_Salix_spp_for_alpine_and_small_urban_gardens/links/53ebaa0f0cf24f241f1351a7/Ornamental- willows-Salix-spp-for-alpine-and-small-urban-gardens.pdf The cultivar S. brachycarpa 'Blue Fox' is most popular, valued for its blue-gray foliage and low stature, reaching approximately 1 m in height. =Medicinal plant= Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, for medicinal purposes, basket weaving, to make bows and arrows, and for building animal traps.

Every often, the son and daughter-in-law notice that the lady goes to the beach and prays in the garden every night. When they ask her why she is going to the beach, she says that she is waiting for her husband to come. The son gets angry and says because she has been waiting for 25 years, he is not going to come.

The lead male role was initially supposed to be enacted by Vimal. Later, it was officially announced that Vishnu will be the protagonist of the movie as Vimal who was earlier roped in for the project was unable to allot dates. It will be produced by Udhayanidhi Stalin under the Red Giant Movies banner. Bindu Madhavi was signed up to portray the lead female character in the film in January 2012. However, the FEFSI strike of 2012 delayed the film, and Bindu had to opt out of the film owing to date clashes. She was subsequently replaced by Sunaina. Award-winning actress Nandita Das, who has previously been seen in critically acclaimed Tamil films including Azhagi and Kannathil Muthamittal, was also announced to be joining the team in April 2012. Furthermore, actress Saranya Ponvannan, who previously worked with Seenu in Thenmerku Paruvakaatru which fetched her the National Film Award for Best Actress, was signed for a supporting role. Samuthirakani and Anupama Kumar are also doing important roles in this movie. =Filming= As the film will narrate the story of a village fisherman, major portions of the movie would be shot in the waters of Manapad and Kulasekharapatnam. The film's shoot was delayed after Vishnu injured his arm while playing in the Celebrity Cricket League and the shoot will continue on 8 April. Director Seenu Ramasamy has completed the shoot of the talking part of the film and the crew will be shooting fight sequences and song sequences for 25 days, starting from 15 June. Producer Udhayanidhi Stalin has sold the Satellite rights of the movie to Sun TV for a whopping price. Soundtrack N. R. Raghunanthan composed the soundtrack, teaming up with Seenu Ramasamy for the second time. The soundtrack album consists of 7 tracks. The lyrics were written by Vairamuthu. The audio was launched in a grand, emotional and classy manner at the Satyam Cinemas on 10 October 2012. However, a few lines in \\"Para Para\\" created controversy among Christians, which led them to protest against the song; thus, the lyrics were removed. =Reception= Behindwoods wrote:\\"Neerparavai is N.R.R‚Äôs best album so far that deserves a few more listens\\". Critical reception Sify gave 4 stars with a \\"good\\" Verdict and said the movie as \\"a moving drama that will undoubtedly leave you with a lump in your throat.

Instead of knowledge of the environment (as with, for example, smell or sight), the sensus divinitatis is alleged to give humans a knowledge of God. In Calvin's view, there is no reasonable non-belief. Neo- Calvinists who adhere to the presuppositionalist school of Christian apologetics sometimes appeal to a sensus divinitatis to argue that there are no genuine atheists: Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga of the University of Notre Dame posits a modified form of the sensus divinitatis whereby all have the sense, only it does not work properly in some humans, due to sin's noetic effects. (See Reformed epistemology.) Roman Catholic theologian Karl Rahner proposed an innate sense of God, which has been noted to share elements in common with Calvin's Sensus Divinitatis. Jonathan Edwards, the 18th-century American Calvinist preacher and theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of \\"true benevolence\\". Criticism Philosopher Evan Fales presents three arguments against the presence of a sensus divinitatis: # The divergence of claims and beliefs (lack of reliability, even within Christian sects). # The lack of demonstrably superior morality of Christians versus non-Christians. # Bible verses, accepted by most Christians as authored by men inspired by the Holy Spirit‚Äîpresumably with a functioning sensus divinitatis‚Äîin which \\"God performs, commands, accepts or countenances rape, genocide, human sacrifice, pestilence to punish David for taking a census, killing David's infant to punish him, hatred of family, capital punishment for breaking a monetary promise, and so on\\". Philosopher Steven Maitzen claimed in 2006 that the demographics of religious belief make the existence of the sensus divinitatis unlikely, as this sense appears so unevenly distributed. Hans Van Eyghen argues that the phenomenological description of the sensus divinitatis does not match what the cognitive sciences show about religious belief. However, Maitzen may have confused Aquinas's sensus dei with sensus divinitatis‚Äîsensus divinitatis (a religious sense) only necessitates a core religious/faith component to one's beliefs, whereas the sensus dei aims at a natural knowledge of God‚Äîcompare In the Twilight of Western Thought by Herman Dooyeweerd (1894‚Äì1977).

It was created by the War Department on February 3, 1865, at the direction of General Ulysses S. Grant to bring all the military departments west of the Mississippi River under a single commander.  History =Background= Following the successful conclusion of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the administration of the United States Army was theoretically directed, under the President of the United States, by the Secretary of War and the general in chief. In practice the Secretary of War and the heads of the army's staff agencies‚Äîwho reported directly to him (adjutant general, quartermaster general, commissary general, inspector general, paymaster general, surgeon general, chief engineer, colonel of topographical engineers, and colonel of ordnance)‚Äîexercised full authority, leaving the general-in-chief a figurehead. With a lack of central direction, policy and strategy were de facto developed by the commanders of the numbered geographical departments and three division headquarters. After October 31, 1853, the division echelon was eliminated and the six western departments consolidated into four (Departments of Texas, New Mexico, the West, and the Pacific), whose department commanders employed their troops as they saw fit. The system returned to six departments in 1858 when the Department of Utah was created in January, and the Department of the Pacific split into the Departments of California and Oregon in September. Military activity affecting one department often originated in another department, preventing efficient use of limited manpower and coordination of efforts. Friction between the Secretaries of War and the generals in chief, and particularly between Jefferson Davis and Winfield Scott, obstructed reforms in the staff system that might have brought unity of command and civilian control of the military. The expansion of the army during the Civil War saw a proliferation in the numbers of geographic departments and their subordinate districts, often changing names and areas under their individual control, some departments eliminated or renamed, only to be recreated again in altered form. = Departments of the Missouri and Kansas = The Department of the Missouri resulted from the reorganization and breakup the Department of the West on November 9, 1861, after Abraham Lincoln fired John C. Fr√©mont when he would not rescind his order emancipating the slaves of Missouri and imposing martial law on the state. David Hunter served briefly as the last commander Department of the West. The new department included Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky west of the Cumberland River and at times, Kansas. It briefly merged with the Department of Mississippi in 1862, but was recreated September 19, now consisting of Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, and the Indian Territory. Colorado and Nebraska were added on October 11, 1862, and the department became generally known as the Department of the Missouri. From 1862 to 1865 the department was primarily concerned with fighting Confederates in Missouri and Arkansas. The Department of Kansas was created for a third time on January 1, 1864, removing major areas from the military jurisdiction of the Department of the Missouri. The new commander of the Department of Kansas, Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis, had two districts (Colorado and Nebraska) wholly involved in Indian warfare, but Curtis was absorbed with fighting Confederates in the Indian Territory and bushwackers in Kansas, allowing his other districts, but particularly Colorado, complete autonomy. Governor John Evans and Colorado district commander Col. John M. Chivington took advantage of this lack of oversight to aggressively attack Cheyenne villages in April 1864, igniting a major Indian war in July. Curtis created a new district, the Upper Arkansas, to wage the war but he was wholly incapable of locating his opponents. In his other district, Nebraska, the warfare was even more intense, but the forces there too weak to deal with it. Division of the Missouri  =Creation= In December 1864 the Division of the Missouri was created to oversee the operations and administration of the Department of the Missouri, the Department of the Northwest (created in 1862), and the Department of Arkansas. Grant had the division created to allow for the movement of troops by a single commander between geographical departments on the frontier in order to deal quickly with military contingencies without the time-consuming approval of the War Department. The new division also created a higher command with which Grant could reward Maj. Gen. John Pope for his handling of Indian conflicts in the Department of the Northwest; and to replace William Rosecrans in command of the Department of the Missouri and Curtis in command of the Department of Kansas, both of whom had found disfavor with Grant. Pope took command of the Division of the Missouri on February 3, 1865, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, with headquarters moving soon after to St. Louis. Major General Grenville M. Dodge took command of the existing Department of the Missouri on December 9, 1864. The Department of the Missouri expanded to include the Dakota Territory (formerly in the Department of the Northwest) and Utah, then had the Department of Kansas merged into it on January 30, 1865. Curtis was reassigned to command the much smaller Department of the Northwest on February 17, 1865. Maj. Gen. Joseph J. Reynolds remained in command of the Department of Arkansas. The Department of the Northwest through the remainder of the Civil War consisted of the Districts of Wisconsin (Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Davies), Minnesota (Brig-Gen. Henry H. Sibley) and Iowa (Brig-Gen Alfred Sully). The Department of the Missouri expanded to eight districts: five in Missouri (St. Louis, Rolla, Central Missouri, North Missouri, and Southwest Missouri) and three on the Indian frontier, the Districts of North Kansas (Brig-Gen. Robert B. Mitchell), Upper Arkansas (Brig-Gen James H. Ford), and The Plains (Brig- Gen Patrick E. Connor), the last a new district that combined Nebraska (East Sub-District), Utah (West Sub District), Colorado (South Sub-District), and the area now Wyoming (North Sub-District). =Post-war reorganization= On June 27, 1865, the War Department issued General Order No. 118, reorganizing the United States (including those states formerly making up the Confederacy) into five military divisions and 18 geographical departments. The Department of the Northwest ceased to exist and its districts were merged into the Department of the Missouri with Pope now in command at Fort Leavenworth. The Division of the Missouri became the Military Division of the Mississippi, commanded by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in St. Louis. In addition to the Department of the Missouri and the Department of Arkansas, the Division of the Mississippi included the new Department of the Ohio (Maj. Gen. E.O.C. Ord, Detroit). Soon after Sherman and his staff arrived in St. Louis, however, the title of the division reverted to the Military Division of the Missouri, and the territory east of the Mississippi River was removed from it. However, the Division of the Missouri still included all states and territories west of the Mississippi River, north of Texas, and east of Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona. On July 28, 1866, Congress enacted the peacetime establishment of the United States Army and Sherman was promoted to lieutenant general. The Military Division of the Missouri was reorganized into four geographical departments: the Department of Arkansas; the Department of the Missouri (Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, and the Indian Territory); the Department of the Platte (Iowa, Nebraska, and the Territories of Wyoming, Utah, and Idaho east of the 114th meridian; March 5, 1866), and the Department of Dakota (Minnesota and the Territories of Montana and Dakota; August 11, 1866). Arkansas was withdrawn from the division on March 11, 1867. In February 1868 Sherman was assigned by President Andrew Johnson to command the proposed Military Division of the Atlantic as Johnson struggled with Radical Republicans over Reconstruction policy and attempted to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from office. However Sherman, who did not want to serve in Washington, D.C., advised Johnson that he would resign rather than carry out the order, which was then rescinded. Sherman remained in command of the Division of the Missouri until Grant was elected president, at which point Sherman was promoted to general and assumed command of the Army of the United States, March 4, 1869. Philip H. Sheridan was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned to command the Division of the Missouri with headquarters at Chicago. Texas was readmitted to the Union in 1870, and together with the Indian Territory, became the Department of Texas as an addition to the Division of the Missouri.

Its buildings display different phases of Gothic Revival architecture, and in 1979 the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance. With St. Paul's, the first Episcopal church parish in Watertown, was organized in 1847 under the guidance of Rev. Melancthon Hoyt, a missionary circuit preacher from Fox Lake who had been visiting Watertown for two years. Services were initially held in Watertown's Methodist church, but within a year the parish built its own church on Third Street between Market and Jefferson. In the following years the parish grew and became self-sufficient. By 1859 it included seventy communicants. In 1859 the parish decided to build again. They constructed a new church building on 2nd St. - the main church hall that stands today. It was designed by James Douglas of Milwaukee in a style described in 1859 as \\"modern Gothic style.\\" We now consider the nave rather quaint Gothic Revival, marked by the steep roofs, lancet windows, and simple decoration. It is sixty feet long plus an 18-foot recess chancel, and 38 feet wide including buttresses. The walls are of Watertown cream brick from D.S. Chadwick's brickyard. Inside, the walls and ceiling are plastered, with wood wainscoting on the walls. The masons were John and James Ford, and the builders were Samuel Vaux and William Honey. In 1885 a rectory was added, with cream brick walls in two colors, tall windows and doors, and steeply pitched cross-gabled roofs. Its style is Gothic Revival too, but in a flavor quite different from the graceful nave. In 1886 a chapel was added connecting to the church. It is brick, with lancet windows and buttresses like the church, but with less emphasis on the vertical. The roof is less steep and a round window is in the wall above the entrance. In 1890 over a side entrance they built a large square tower with a tall octagonal spire topped with a cross. In contrast to the simple, graceful 1859 nave, the new multi-colored tower was in High Victorian Gothic style, more ornate, heavy and solid. From 1890 to 1909 the original stained glass windows in the church were replaced with windows made by the Milwaukee Art Glass Company. Another view of the church In 1931 a gable-roofed guild hall was added, of brick to match the other buildings, and perhaps a hint of Gothic style, but with round-arched, segmental-arched windows and rectangular windows. Today St. Paul's is one of the oldest church buildings still in use in Watertown. The NRHP considers the church complex architecturally significant, illustrating how Gothic architecture changed over time.

It is native to North America, where it occurs throughout much of Alaska, northern and western Canada, and the contiguous United States south through the Rocky Mountains to northern New Mexico.Uchytil, Ronald J. 1992. Salix glauca. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. It can also be found in Greenland, northwestern Europe, and Siberia. This willow is usually a shrub growing up to tall, but in appropriate habitat it becomes a tree up to tall. The smooth gray bark becomes furrowed with age. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate individuals. This species has secondary sexual dimorphism, with male and female individuals different in function or morphology in aspects other than their reproductive structures. For example, female plants are more sensitive to drought conditions. The seed stays on the plant until fall, when it is dispersed. The seed is coated in downy fibers that help it disperse on the wind and on water. Unlike the seeds of many other willows, these do not germinate immediately on contact with the substrate, but overwinter under the snow and sprout in the spring. This provides cold stratification to the seeds, and allows them a few weeks more to develop than in summer-dispersing willows. In the northern part of its range, this plant codominates with other species of willow on floodplains and in shrubby riparian and tundra habitat. It may also grow scattered throughout coniferous forests and woodlands, dominated often by spruces. In the southern part of its range, it grows in alpine and subalpine climates. Like many other willows, it colonizes freshly cleared habitat, such as floodplains recently scoured by water and forests recently burned. The taxonomy of S. glauca has been described as \\"confusing\\". With considerable geographic variation across its wide circumboreal-polar range, S. glauca may be considered \\"a very widespread and polymorphic species or species group\\", with currently no consensus whether it should be subdivided into races, subspecies or varieties. Formally and informally, there are a number of recognized subspecies (such as glauca, stipulifera, acutifolia, callicarpaea) and varieties (such as acutifolia, glauca, stipulata, villosa), but there are only small morphological differences to tell them apart. Furthermore, S. glauca is known to form hybrids with other willows, resulting in intermediates that are visually difficult to distinguish from one another. Some varieties and subspecies have very specific or limited distribution, though. The hybrid S. arctophila √ó S. glauca subsp. callicarpaea, for instance, is not found in Canada, and is common in eastern parts of Greenland, but absent from the west, whereas S. glauca subsp. glauca is not found on Greenland at all. As with other willows, S. glauca is an important food source for a variety of animals, particularly wintering ungulates, providing them with a rich source of calcium and phosphorus. It is considered moderately important as moose browse, and during the winter it constitutes much of the diet for snowshoe hares. Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, for medicinal purposes, basket weaving, to make bows and arrows, and for building animal traps.

It is situated near Parbatipur, which was an important rail junction in undivided India, connecting the North East to the rest of the country. The Marwaris, attracted by the prospect of trade and commerce had settled in the town of Saidpur, long before the Partition of India. The Marwaris became a part of the local population and contributed to the society. In 1911, Tulsiram Agarwal had founded the Tulsiram Girls High School. Some of them had earned a respected position in the society because of their social work. After the Partition, the Marwaris chose to stay back in East Pakistan, instead of emigrating to India. Thousands of Urdu-speaking Muslims from Bihar and the United Provinces settled in Saidpur. In 1971, the Urdu speaking Muslims constituted 75% of the population of city. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Urdu-speaking Muslims openly collaborated with the Pakistanis. Saidpur became a strong support base for the Pakistani occupation army. On 12 April, the Pakistani occupation army killed eminent Marwari citizens Tulsiram Agarwal, Yamuna Prasad Kedia and Rameshwar Lal Agarwal at Nisbetganj, near the Rangpur cantonment. The killings created a panic in the Marwari community. Their homes were looted by the Urdu-speaking Bihari Muslims.  Events  On 1 June, the Pakistani occupation army took hostage 185 Marwari men to the Saidpur cantonment. The Pakistanis were led by local Bihari leaders. Major Gul of the Pakistani occupation army employed them in renovation of the Saidpur airbase and digging trenches for military purposes. A few days later, Major Gul stated that he would send them to India through the border outpost at Haldibari. Meanwhile, on 5 June, the Pakistani occupation army announced that the Hindus of Saidpur would be provided a safe passage to India through the Chilahati border into the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal. On the morning of 13 June, at about 6 a.m., the 185 prisoners were brought to the Saidpur railway station in four military trucks. They were assured a safe passage to India and asked to bring their family and relatives. They rushed to their houses in the joy of freedom and soon returned with their families. The Pakistani soldiers and the Bihari Muslims segregated the crowd into men and women. A special train had arrived at the Saidpur railway station at 8 a.m. They were boarded into separate compartments, two each for the men and the women. The doors and the windows were locked from inside. While boarding no less 20 married and unmarried women were detained by the Pakistani soldiers and later taken to the Saidpur cantonment. At about 10 a.m. the special train commenced its journey towards India. Soon after the journey had commenced, the train abruptly came to a halt over a railway culvert in Golahat, a locality in the outskirts of the Saidpur town, two kilometres of the Saidpur railway station. The doors of the compartments were opened and Bihari Muslims, armed with shining ramdaos entered the compartments. The entire area was surrounded by the Pakistani military, armed with automatic weapons. The Bihari Muslims abused the Hindus, calling them malaun and stated that their lives were not even worthy of a bullet. The men, women and children were dragged out one by one. The Pakistani occupation army and their non- Bengali Muslim collaborators bayoneted and butchered them to death. The children who were crying out of fear were either smashed on the railway tracks or flung into the air and then caught with bayonets. There is some confusion regarding the number of people killed in the Golahat massacre. According to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha and Prothom Alo 437 Hindus were killed in the massacre. However, Sarmila Bose mentioned a figure of 338, quoting from an account of Dwarka Prasad Singhania, Marwari businessman of Saidpur. Only ten from those who boarded the train could escape. They ran towards Dinajpur and finally took shelter in India.  Memorial  In 2010, Prajanma 71 and Saidpur Smaranika Parishad commemorated the martyrdom of the victims through puja and anjali at the mass killing site at Golahat. No memorial has been erected even after 40 years of the Liberation War. The relics of the massacre are being lost. Local land sharks have encroached upon the site of mass killing and started cultivation. Sumit Agarwala, the president of Saidpur Smaranika Parishad demanded a national memorial at the mass killing site.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. St. Bernard's parish was organized in 1843, when Wisconsin was a territory. In 1846 a modest 27 by 36-foot wooden church with Gothic Revival styling was constructed for the parish on the site of the current church. Watertown was largely populated by German and Irish immigrants, and St. Bernard's attracted many of the Irish minority. With A rectory was added in 1847 and a church school building in 1857. By the 1872 the parish needed a larger building, and the Holy Cross Fathers sent Reverend William Corby to St. Bernard's as pastor, charged with getting a new church built. Corby commissioned Patrick Keely, architect of many Catholic churches out east, to design the new church. Keely designed the building which stands to this day. It was built from 1873 to 1876 with money and sweat of the parishioners. The cornerstone, laid in 1873, was carved from a piece of the Rock of Cashel, from back in dear old Erin. Keely designed the church in High Victorian Gothic style, characterized by the emphasis on vertical lines, the pointed-topped arches, and the polychromatic masonry. The floor plan is generally rectangular, with a large square entrance tower at the front and a polygonal apse at the back. The foundation is limestone blocks; the walls above are cream brick with contrasting bands of red brick and stone. On the front tower is a spire with clocks on its four faces. That spire rises to 210 feet, and is topped with a cross. Inside, the apse still contains stained glass windows from the 1870s. In the 1890s German immigrant Hermann Michalowski painted large murals of St. Francis, St. Bernard, St. Patrick, and St. Elizabeth on panels in the apse. In 1883 a new rectory (later used as a convent) was built to replace the old one. It was initially two-story and brick with some Italianate details. Later additions have obscured much of the original building, but the interesting roof-line and the iron cresting on the bay window remain. In 1892 a larger school building was built to replace the original. It is a two-story building, with round arches suggesting the Romanesque Revival style. The building is cream brick, with a two-story entry pavilion with corner cylinders like the rolls of a scroll, topped with a stone cross. The school building was largely paid for by Dr. Edward Johnson and the building contractor was Mat Franzen. The school building is the last surviving historic parochial school building in a city where in the late 1800s two thirds of the students attended parochial schools.

In it, Miranda is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in the 2009 iOS game Mass Effect Galaxy, and then serving as a squadmate in Mass Effect 2. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the Mass Effect: Redemption comic series, in Mass Effect 3 if she survived the events of the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, and in issues 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the Mass Effect: Foundation comic series. She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father, Henry Lawson, to be perfect, and ran away from home to join Cerberus. Yvonne Strahovski voices Miranda and provided the model for her. Like Strahovski, Miranda was originally blonde but the character was changed to have black hair to complement her \\"femme fatale\\" look. Camera angles and shots were employed to emphasise her sexuality. David Kates composed her theme for Mass Effect 2. Miranda was featured prominently in promotional art, demo footage, trailers and advertisements for Mass Effect 2. The character was mostly well-received, though various sources criticized the game's numerous camera shots of her buttocks, a creative decision then-marketing director of Bioware, David Silverman has defended as an integral part of her character. Character overview In Mass Effect 2, Miranda Lawson is revealed to be a high-ranking operative of the pro-human organization Cerberus, and has been genetically designed for superior intelligence and physical traits. She is shown to be a capable leader, exemplified with her being one of the few members of the squad who can successfully lead a fireteam in the final mission without anyone dying, despite feeling she does not command respect like Shepard does. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard. Aboard the Normandy, the player's spaceship, she is Shepard's second-in- command and Executive Officer, and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man. Miranda was the artificially created daughter of Henry Lawson, a rich and powerful businessman from Earth. Rather than give her a human mother to randomize her genetic code, Henry took his own DNA and doubled his X chromosome, hoping to create a dynasty. Unhappy with his attempts to exert control over her life, Miranda joined Cerberus and secretly sent her sister, who was created in the same way she was, into hiding to protect her from their father. Provided the player completes a mission to prevent her sister's abduction, she ultimately becomes loyal to Shepard. In one of the story's possible endings, she proves her loyalty when the Illusive Man gives her an order to prevent Shepard from destroying the Collectors' Space Station by refusing and announcing her resignation before ending the communication abruptly. Creation and development Yvonne Strahovski at WonderCon 2009. Humanity's iteration in Mass Effect is meant to be only fairly far in the future enough to be \\"new but not unrecognisable\\". Through standardizing the different concept art for their clothes, a \\"common visual language\\" was found for them. Early concept art for Miranda focused on balancing her sex appeal with a uniform suitable for her position as a Cerberus officer. Originally conceived as blonde, after her uniform was designed, it was decided black hair would fit better with her \\"femme fatale\\" look.Mass Effect 2 Digital Art Book. Casey Hudson has said her uniform was made tight due to her being designed to be \\"perfect\\" and \\"beautiful\\". For her role as Miranda Lawson, Yvonne Strahovski spoke in her natural speaking voice and native Australian accent. Miranda is an example of a character who is defined by their attractiveness. In Mass Effect 2, camera angles and shots such as a close-up of her buttocks were employed to focus on \\"her curves and sexuality\\", identified as key parts of her character, her being someone genetically engineered to be \\"perfect\\". David Kates composed Miranda's musical theme, intending to \\"demonstrate her strength, but also her vulnerable side, and a sadness that is deep inside her\\". Mac Walters and Patrick Weekes wrote her character for Mass Effect 2. Jay Watamaniuk wrote her for Mass Effect 3. Appearances =Mass Effect 2= Miranda is one of Shepard's squad members in Mass Effect 2. She's one of the top agents of the pro-human organization Cerberus, assigned to supervise the \\"Lazarus Project\\", which was the project that brought Shepard back to life. When Shepard's sent by Cerberus' leader, the Illusive Man, to stop the main antagonists, the Collectors, Miranda joins as the new Normandys executive officer, giving mission reports to the Illusive Man. Through conversations with her, Shepard learns of Miranda's background. She tells Shepard that she was genetically \\"created\\" by her father, Henry Lawson, who is one of the wealthiest humans in the galaxy. She tells Shepard that she was created to be the genetically \\"perfect\\" human, able to heal from injuries more quickly, and with more powerful biotic abilities, as well as exceptional schooling, all as part of her father's desire to have a \\"dynasty\\" to follow him. Her father's persistence in making Miranda as \\"perfect\\" as possible resulted in her not having a normal childhood, forbidden from having any friends or relations with anybody else, and forced to enhance her abilities constantly. At an old enough age, Miranda was able to escape from her father, hinting that \\"shots were fired\\", and fled to Cerberus, who she had learned her father was an investor to. Cerberus gave her asylum, and her father cut off his support of Cerberus. Later on in the game, Miranda asks Shepard for help to save her sister. She reveals that her father, after Miranda had escaped from him, created another daughter, Miranda's genetic twin sister, Oriana. Miranda was able to rescue Oriana, taking her from her father and giving her to another family to have a normal life. She tells Shepard that her father has been able to track Oriana down and has hired mercenaries to apprehend her. Miranda has arranged for Cerberus to safely move Oriana and her family away but needs Shepard's help. If Shepard helps, Miranda learns that the only friend she ever had or trusted, Niket, had betrayed her and is working with the mercenaries to take Oriana away. The following confrontation leaves the captain of the mercenaries dead as well as Niket, who, depending on Shepard's actions, is killed either by Miranda herself or by the mercenary captain. Afterward, Miranda sees Oriana with her family, and if Shepard convinces her, goes and meets Oriana, introducing herself to her. Afterward, if Shepard converses with Miranda more, she admits to Shepard that even though she's supposed to be perfect, she feels that everything she had done is the result of her father genetic tailoring of her, not because of her actions. Shepard can convince her that she gives her father too much credit, saying that while he did give Miranda her abilities and gifts, everything she has accomplished is the result of her using those abilities that she had been given. This seems to reassure Miranda and she thanks Shepard for it. During the \\"Suicide Mission\\", Miranda can survive or die depending on the player's choices in the mission and also if they do Miranda's loyalty mission. If the player uses a male Shepard character, they can pursue Miranda as a possible romance. =Mass Effect 3= Miranda returns in Mass Effect 3, provided the player does not import a save where she dies. After defeating the Collectors, she has left Cerberus. Given she was a high- ranking Cerberus officer, she indicated the Illusive Man ordered a hit on her, causing her to go on the run. Shepard meets Miranda on the Citadel, where she expresses her concerns that Oriana was found by her father. After a brief contact with Miranda, where she expresses concern that her father is working with the Illusive Man, she asks Shepard to meet her on the Citadel, where she asks Shepard for access to Alliance resources, though she won't say why even if Shepard presses her. If Shepard refuses her access, she accepts Shepard's choice and leaves. If Shepard grants her access, she then confesses that when she had headed the Lazarus Project to revive Shepard, she wanted to put a control chip in Shepard's brain, to ensure Shepard wouldn't go rogue, but the Illusive Man, not wanting to take away who Shepard was, ordered her not to. Miranda admits that she was hypocritical in this since she had been doing everything she could to keep her father from controlling her life and Oriana's. Shepard can forgive her, saying that the main point is that she brought him back. Later, Shepard finds Miranda in a Cerberus lab disguised as a refugee camp, Sanctuary, where her father had been running experiments on the refugees, as well as her father and Oriana. If Shepard is able to negotiate with Henry to let Oriana go, Miranda then kills him with a biotic attack. If Shepard is unable to negotiate, Miranda will still attack her father to save Oriana, and while she will kill him, he will fatally shoot her in the process. Miranda's fate also depends on if Shepard had warned her earlier on about the Cerberus assassin Kai Leng, who Miranda encounters on Sanctuary. If Shepard didn't warn her, or refused her access to Alliance resources, or didn't do her loyalty mission in Mass Effect 2, Miranda will die. She'll also die if she was romanced by a male Shepard in Mass Effect 2, but then breaks up with her in Mass Effect 3. If Shepard had completed Miranda's loyalty mission, as well as warned her of Kai Leng, Miranda survives and, after taking Oriana to safety, assists in the war effort. Like other past and present surviving squad members, Miranda makes an appearance in the Mass Effect 3: Citadel downloadable content pack, which adds character moments which will vary in content depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her. Miranda is also available as a temporary squadmate in the Armax Arsenal Arena combat simulator. =In other media= Miranda first appeared in the iOS game Mass Effect Galaxy, released in 2009. In Galaxy, Miranda communicates with Jacob Taylor as a hologram and is his main informant on how to stop the batarian threat Miranda returns in the 2009 comic book series Mass Effect: Redemption, where she first encounters Liara T'Soni and Feron on Omega, offering to help them recover the lost Commander Shepard. After meeting Liara with the Illusive Man, she then takes Liara and Feron back to Omega, telling them that Shepard's body is still on the station and instructs them to recover it, with Cerberus reimbursing them for their efforts. Later, when the Shadow Broker's agent Tazzik makes off with Shepard's body to sell to the Collectors, Miranda asks the Illusive Man for permission to stop him, but the Illusive Man tells her to wait, saying that they need to find out why the Collectors are interested in Shepard. Miranda then notices Feron and Liara giving pursuit and asks to follow them, but the Illusive Man once again tells her to wait. At the end of the series, when Liara rescues Shepard's body and brings it to a Cerberus facility, Miranda tells Liara that she has doubts on whether or not Shepard can be revived, but assures her that if it's possible to bring Shepard back, Cerberus will do all they can. Miranda is also a major supporting character in the Mass Effect: Foundation comic series, a prequel to the original Mass Effect trilogy and stars the main antagonist of the Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC Maya Brooks as a point of view character. Reception An example shot when Shepard (right) talks to Miranda, which criticism fell on. Marketing director David Silverman defended the shots, believing \\"her curves and sexuality\\" to be key aspects of her character. Miranda received a mostly positive reception, and is a popular subject for fan art and cosplay. BioWare revealed that Miranda's loyalty mission, which had a more \\"a touchy-feely\\" plot, was completed more than Grunt's on PC, but in the case of Xbox 360 players it was the opposite. Strahovski was nominated for \\"Best Performance by a Human Female\\" in the Spike Video Game Awards. Upon hearing news for a potential Mass Effect film, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer looked at the different characters and felt Strahovski should reprise the role, calling her the \\"obvious choice\\". A reader's poll published by PC Gamer in 2015 revealed that Miranda is the second most popular love interest for Shepard after Liara T'Soni in the Mass Effect series. In a 2016 article, PC Gamer ranked Miranda the eighth best companion of the Mass Effect series. On the character's story arc, PC Gamer staff member provided the following comments: \\"Miranda's experience of genetic enhancements links back to her complicated relationship with her father, which is more closely and brutally examined in Mass Effect 3. This personal crisis makes her one of the series' more complex characters, in my opinion, offering some clear motivations for why she is the way she is\\". Attention was given to her looks. Complex listed her buttocks as one of the best in gaming, commenting \\"Miranda is lethal, brilliant and looks just as hot running into battle as she does walking away from it\\". Complex also included her at number 40 in a list of the 50 hottest video game characters, and included her as one of 25 \\"best-looking sideline chicks in games\\". UGO.com similarly listed the character as the \\"ninth-hottest fictional woman of 2012\\", calling her a \\"sultry brunette\\". MSN listed Miranda as one of the hottest women in video game history, commenting \\"Genetically designed to be \\"perfect\\", Miranda Lawson knows she's hot, intelligent, and is not afraid to tell anyone about it.\\". However, 1UP.com's Ryan Winterhalter called Miranda one of three areas where Mass Effect 2 was sexist, finding not fault with her concept as a genetically perfect woman, but mainly with the camera's focus on her buttocks. Michael Graff from Screenrant was in agreement, ranking it one of the Mass Effect series' most cringe-inducing moments. Soha Kareem, in her essay \\"Mashing Our Buttons: On Romance And Sex In Video Games\\" published in The Secret Loves of Geek Girls: Expanded Edition, criticized Miranda as a \\"boring femme fatale type whose screen time includes opportunistic angles on her ass\\" and who mistreats other female characters like Jack. She further alleged that the character is \\"pretentious\\", \\"a product of wealth and masculine power structures\\", and that Miranda \\"would write the space version of Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In.\\" Luke Plunkett from Kotaku criticized her romance subplot arc in Mass Effect 3, noting that \\"The pathetic way in which the relationship, such a cornerstone of the second game, was given such short shrift was in hindsight a blessing\\" in response to Miranda's change of characterization. Evan Lahti from PC Gamer compared Miranda to furniture and commented, \\"What do we remember about her, other than her skintight bodysuit and the way Mass Effect 2's camera suggestively frames her hips?\\" References External links * *Mass Effect 2 - Miranda Trailer on the official EA - Electronic Arts (deutsch) YouTube Channel Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional Australian people in video games Category:Fictional biologists Category:Fictional geneticists Category:Fictional patricides Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Fictional telekinetics Category:Genetically engineered characters in video games Category:Mass Effect characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2009 Category:Video game sidekicks ","title":"Miranda Lawson"},{"id":"34501221","text":"Addounia TV () is a private television station based in Damascus, Syria since March 23, 2007.

It was originally built by a German immigrant near Germantown, Wisconsin. In 1973 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In the late 1830s Christian Turck walked into a swamp near his home a mile south of Kirchhayn in Washington County and began to cut cedar logs to build a house. He squared them and laid them horizontally on top of each other, notching the corners to hold them together. A summer beam runs down the center of the house at each level, with other beams connected to it by mortise and tenon joints. Perrin points out that in this eastern German Blockbau style, the logs aren't fitted as tightly as in most Norwegian log construction, since the logs would shrink anyway, and chinking would be needed. This house was chinked with clay, rye straw, and lime plaster. The resulting log cabin was large - two stories plus attic. Across the front (sunny south) Christian built a full-width porch sheltered by a cantilevered shed roof. On the back the roof extends down to a one-story level, adding a couple rooms and giving the building a saltbox profile. With Near his house, Christian laid up a brick structure which served as a smoke house, bake oven and summer kitchen. View from another angle, after 1933 Perrin points out that the Turck house is important because few examples of this German Blockbau style (solid logs) remain in Wisconsin, in contrast to the more common German Fachwerk style, where the framing logs are filled with brick or some other material. Because of this, the Historic American Buildings Survey carefully documented the house in 1936. At that time John Schottler was living in the house and the surveyor described its condition as excellent in one place and fair in another. That 1933 survey produced these documents: File:Christian Turck House, Kirchhayn, Washington County, WI HABS WIS,66-KIRHA.V,1- (sheet 0 of 5).tif File:Christian Turck House, Kirchhayn, Washington County, WI HABS WIS,66-KIRHA.V,1- (sheet 1 of 5).tif File:Christian Turck House, Kirchhayn, Washington County, WI HABS WIS,66-KIRHA.V,1- (sheet 2 of 5).tif File:Christian Turck House, Kirchhayn, Washington County, WI HABS WIS,66-KIRHA.V,1- (sheet 3 of 5).tif File:Christian Turck House, Kirchhayn, Washington County, WI HABS WIS,66-KIRHA.V,1- (sheet 4 of 5).tif File:Christian Turck House, Kirchhayn, Washington County, WI HABS WIS,66-KIRHA.V,1- (sheet 5 of 5).tif In 2013, reconstructed at Old World Wisconsin By 1971 the NRHP nomination described the condition of the house as \\"ruinous.\\" Vandalism could not be prevented in its location near Kirchhayn, and it was facing demolition. Recognizing its importance as a representative of its style, the State Historical Society bought it. Because it couldn't be moved as a whole, it was carefully disassembled, with each piece numbered, and placed in storage. A few years later, the house was moved to Old World Wisconsin and reconstructed as the Schottler House - an example German farmhouse.

An 1811 painting by L.P. Strack illustrating the steep Geest slope. Extent of the urstromtal in and around Hamburg The Elbe Urstromtal () refers to the present-day valley of the Elbe over a length of around between the German town of Genthin, Saxony-Anhalt, and the Elbe's mouth into the North Sea near Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony. The urstromtal, or glacial meltwater valley, emerged at the height of the Weichselian glaciation.  History  alt=above: ancient, below: current The Elbe Urstromtal probably emerged between the coldest period of the Weichselian glaciation, about 22,000 to 18,000 years ago, and the end of the glaciation in North Germany about 14,500 years ago. At that time the glacier was melting and the waters attempted to find their way to the lowest lying points. The Elbe Urstromtal collected the meltwaters and carried them to the North Sea, which then lay up to 120 meters below its present level. The then coastline was about further north. The Elbe Urstromtal also collected the meltwaters of the three urstromt√§ler, the Glogau-Baruth Urstromtal, Warsaw-Berlin Urstromtal and Thorn-Eberswald Urstromtal and carried them in the direction of the North Sea Basin. Today, the course of the Elbe Urstromtal roughly follows the course of the present day Elbe river, because ‚Äì unlike other Urstromt√§lern ‚Äì the Elbe Urstromtal has neither dried out nor silted up, but still carries the River Elbe, which has its source in the Bohemian Giant Mountains. The old course of the meltwater river can be easily made out in the Lower Elbe (Niederelbe) region. For example, there is still a roughly 50-meter-high geest slope from Bergedorf to Geesthacht which was the old river bank. Likewise, there is a roughly 30-meter-high slope at the height of Hamburg's western Elbe suburbs (Elbvororte) Othmarschen, Nienstedten and Blankenese.

Events  In April 1971, a member of the Razakar forces, Kenan Uddin Sarkar of Ramchandrapur village under Parbatipur sub-division of Dinajpur district, assured 50 Hindu families of neighbouring Badarganj, Kholahati, Birampur, Aftabganj and Sherpur of a safe passage to India. He kept the Hindus confined at a place called Baraihat in present-day Phulbari Upazila. The Razakars and the Al-Badr militia looted the money and jewelry from Hindus during their confinement. After that another Razakar, an associate of Kenan Uddin Sarkar informed the Pakistani army. The Pakistani army took the hostage Hindus to Akhira, 100 metres from south of Baraihat. It was about 11 A.M. The Hindus were made to stand in a row beside a pond, the men in one line and the women and children in another. They were burst fired from machine guns. A few children and teenagers who were survived the burst fire, were bayonetted to death. According to eye witness accounts, after gunning down the men, the Pakistani soldiers turned their attention to the females, and brutally gang raped them at that spot. After the victory in the Liberation War, the local people executed Kenan Uddin Sarkar by the method of Jabiha.  Casualty  The male members of the captive Hindu families were massacred by the Pakistani army. According to the most conservative reports, the casualty figure is 85.

The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. . First published New York, McKay, 1959. p. 887.Eicher, 2001, p. 552 gives the date of his enlistment as January 1, 1861, which is clearly wrong. It might have been January 1, 1862 as it was likely he was almost immediately made an officer. Sifakis, 1988, p. 688 gives the date as about November 1861. Boatner, 1988, p. 887 says Wallace was \\"almost immediately\\" named adjutant. He was soon regimental adjutant and was elected first lieutenant and captain in January 1862. In May 1862, he was elected lieutenant colonel. The regiment was stationed in South Carolina until July 1862.Boatner, 1988, p. 887 says Wallace fought in the Battle of Malvern Hill but this either contradicts or is not mentioned by other sources When the colonel of the regiment was killed during the Second Bull Run Campaign on August 30, 1862, Wallace succeeded to command of the regiment to rank from that date as colonel. He was not formally nominated for the appointment until June 10, 1864. In the brigade of Brigadier General Nathan G. \\"Shanks\\" Evans, Wallace commanded his regiment at the Battle of South Mountain and the Battle of Antietam. The brigade then went to defend Charleston, South Carolina. In the Spring of 1864, the brigade, then commanded by Brigadier General Stephen Elliott, Jr. was ordered to the defense of Petersburg, Virginia. The 18th South Carolina Infantry was holding part of the line under which the Union Army explosive charges were detonated which led to the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864. The mine explosion blew up four companies of the 18th South Carolina Infantry and injured Elliott. William Henry Wallace was promoted to brigadier general, under the Confederate law permitting the Confederate President to appoint twenty temporary brigadier generals on September 20, 1864. Elliott had been incapacitated by the mine explosion so Wallace commanded his former brigade in Major General Bushrod Johnson's division, IV Corp, until the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865 at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.Elliott was slow to recover and did not return to the Army of Northern Virginia. Eventually, he commanded a brigade of former Charleston defenders under General Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina and surrendered with Johnston. Sifakis, 1988, p. 203. Wallace was paroled at Appomattox Court House on that date. Aftermath After the Civil War, Wallace returned to South Carolina where he was a lawyer and planter. He was elected to the South Carolina legislature for three two-year terms starting with the 1872 election. Wallace was a circuit judge from 1877 until he retired in 1893.

It aired on February 6, 2012. Plot In the cold opening, Marshall and Lily discuss their upcoming housewarming party with Lily's father, Mickey, imploring him not to ruin the night. However, during the conversation, Mickey mentions that he has been keeping bees in the basement as part of a recent business venture, much to the couple's dismay. On the night of the party, Ted and Robin arrive in the midst of an argument, which they put on hold as they enter the house. Future Ted explains to his kids that the housewarming party fell apart in five minutes. He proceeds to describe those five minutes, going room by room. In the living room, Lily stresses about how the party is going despite Marshall's reassurance until his boss Garrison Cootes informs him that they need to go back to work. Lily suggests that Cootes have some vegan spring rolls and he departs for the dining room, only to return and confront Ted about the supply of vegan food having already been eaten. Cootes, being a vegan, is angry because he thinks that Ted has eaten the spring rolls, nearly coming to blows with an unusually aggressive Ted before Lily steps in and advises Cootes of other possible food options. He then goes back to the dining room. Meanwhile, a distraught Barney confides in Robin about an issue that is unknown at the moment. Marshall enters with a block of gouda cheese, which Lily quickly destroys. She then sits down, convinced that her party has been a disaster, but Robin manages to convince her otherwise. Moments later, a man in a beekeeper outfit runs through the house on fire. In the dining room, Barney has eaten all the spring rolls as he converses with a woman he deems is crazy until he sees that she is attractive. He then seduces her and she tells him to meet her in the upstairs guest bedroom to engage in sex. After she departs, Cootes arrives and Barney blames Ted for the missing spring rolls, enraging Cootes who then goes into the living room to confront Ted. Having witnessed the conversation between Barney and the attractive woman, Lily demands that Barney talk to her privately in the kitchen. Marshall then asks Robin for help in confronting Cootes, during which Robin struggles to prove she can maintain her composure over small issues that normally enrage her. Soon afterward, Lily and Barney both leave the kitchen upset and enter the living room. Cootes re- enters the dining room, where Marshall asks to speak with him privately in the kitchen. Eventually, he comes back into the dining room, where Mickey tells him he threw a good party. Again, the scene ends with a man in a beekeeper outfit running through the house on fire. In the kitchen, Ted and Robin continue their argument after putting the food they brought to the party in the oven and setting a five-minute timer. They argue over Robin's tendency to start arguments with strangers at the slightest provocation and Ted's tendency to run from confrontation, explaining their weird behaviour in the house. Unable to come to a resolution, they eventually disperse into the party before Lily and Barney enter the kitchen. Lily informs Barney of the attractive woman, her neighbor Geraldine, and her history involving previous lovers: the last man to have slept with Geraldine and not call afterward was hunted down and had a \\"certain part of his anatomy removed\\". As she warns him again not to have sex with Geraldine, the gouda cheese that Marshall served in the previous scene is accidentally knocked to the floor and almost immediately covered in mice. A shocked Lily flees in alarm, followed by Barney soon after he replaces the cheese on the kitchen counter. Marshall and Cootes then enter the kitchen, where Marshall reveals that the recent long hours at the office have resulted in the neglect of his pregnant wife. He requests a night off to relax with family and friends, to which Cootes refuses. Marshall quits out of desperation, telling Cootes he needs to relax and find a hobby if he does not want to work himself to death, then leaves to serve the cheese. Realizing Marshall may have been right, Cootes, at the advice of Mickey, decides to don the beekeeper's outfit in an attempt to take up a hobby. However, based on Barney's apocryphal advice moments earlier, Mickey has doused the suit in kerosene to repel the bees. As Cootes begins to enter the basement, the five minute timer for Robin and Ted's dish goes off on the oven. Unaware of the danger, he opens the oven door and immediately bursts into flames. After a frantic run through the house, Cootes leaps into the snow-covered front yard to extinguish the blaze. Exhilarated at the feeling of being alive, he tells Marshall that they will take the night off. He then asks if he will see Marshall on Monday, to which Marshall replies in the affirmative. When Marshall attempts to re-enter the house, he realizes that Cootes has inadvertently allowed the bees to escape their basement enclosure. Meanwhile, Barney and Geraldine have been upstairs having sex, oblivious to the action occurring in the rest of the house. Barney tries to sneak out when she begins describing their future. He sees the escaped bees in the hallway and hesitates before slinking off into the hallway, screaming at the insect stings. Production When asked in 2014 \\"What is the episode you regret the most? why?\\", show co-creator Carter Bays stated Critical response The A.V.

He was the commander of the 8th Division when it surrendered to the Japanese Empire at the end of the Battle of Singapore. Early life Cecil Arthur Callaghan was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to a merchant and his wife on 31 July 1890. He worked in his father's footwear business after completing his education at Sydney Grammar School. He joined the Citizens Militia Force (CMF) in 1910 by enlisting in the Australian Field Artillery, and was commissioned the following year. Military career =First World War= After Britain's declaration of war against Germany, Callaghan joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was shipped to the Middle East with the 2nd BatteryBean, 1941, p. 86 of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade. He participated in the Gallipoli landings on 25 April 1915. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions in July, when he advanced with infantry to Turkish trenches from where he dispatched reports back to his battery. He was evacuated in December 1915, with the rest of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, from Gallipoli to Egypt and transferred to the 5th Divisional Artillery. In March 1916, he was made commander of the 25th Howitzer Battery and promoted to major. Lieutenant Colonel Callaghan, second from left, with a group of fellow officers of 4th Brigade and the Prime Minister of Australia, Billy Hughes, in Belgium, 1919 Posted to the Western Front, Callaghan commanded a battery in the 13th Field Artillery Brigade in the Somme and Ypres sectors during 1917. After being promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and being placed in command of the 4th Field Artillery Brigade, he spent a month as a liaison officer to French troops in June 1918. He returned to his command in time to lead it during the Hundred Days Offensive. Appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, the last of his four Mentions in Despatches that were earned in the war was gazetted on 11 July 1919. He was also awarded the French Legion of Honour. Returning to Australia in July 1919, his service with the AIF was terminated on 22 January 1920. =Interwar period= Callaghan remained in the Citizens Militia Force and in this capacity commanded Field Artillery Brigades from 1920 to 1926, as well as working in his family's footwear business (which would earn him the nickname \\"Boots\\"). From 1926, he was made temporary colonel and commander of the artillery of 2nd Division (a CMF unit at the time) for several years under the then Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. His rank made permanent, he commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade, another CMF unit, from 1934 to 1938. =Second World War= Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Callaghan was returned to active service in the Royal Australian Artillery, promoted to brigadier, and assigned to command of the artillery of Eastern Command.Wigmore, 1957, p. 28 When the 8th Division was formed in July 1940 as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, he was made commander of its artillery.Wigmore, 1957, p. 28 When the divisional commander, Major General Vernon Sturdee, was appointed Chief of General Staff following the death of General Sir Brudenell White in August 1940, Callaghan once again came under the command of Bennett (now a major general), the new divisional commander.Wigmore, 1957, p. 32 Malayan campaign Originally intended for the Middle East, one brigade (the 22nd) of the 8th Division embarked to Malaya in February 1941 to counter the growing threat from the Japanese Empire. Callaghan remained in Australia with the remainder of the division, eventually arriving in Singapore with the 27th Brigade in August.Wigmore, 1957, p. 84 When the Japanese invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941, Callaghan was temporarily in command of the division while Bennett was in transit from a three-week visit to the Middle East, relinquishing command of the division to Bennett upon his return on 10 December.Wigmore, 1957, p. 153 By early 1942, the Australians had retreated to Singapore Island, with Callaghan personally controlling the artillery supporting the defence of the northern side of the island. However, he was struck down with malaria on 5 February and had to be evacuated to hospital.Wigmore, 1957, pp. 300‚Äì304 He eventually returned to his headquarters on 12 February, although command of the divisional artillery remained with a subordinate.Wigmore, 1957, pp. 362 The Allied position on Singapore was now untenable, and on 15 February the General Officer Commanding, Malaya Lieutenant General Arthur Percival decided to surrender. Bennett, rather than surrender with his command, opted to try and escape and handed command of the division to Callaghan. The division was surrendered to the Japanese the following day, Callaghan reporting personally to Japanese military authorities. Percival promoted him to temporary major general to ensure Callaghan had sufficient status with the Japanese as commander of all Australian forces in Singapore.Wigmore, 1957, pp. 381‚Äì382 Callaghan was made a prisoner of war and was held in former British Army barracks near Changi Prison, along with the other Allied soldiers that had surrendered to the Japanese in Singapore. He was later held in camps in Formosa, Japan and lastly in Manchuria, from which he was liberated by the Red Army in August 1945. As a result of malaria, dysentery and the generally harsh conditions experienced by most prisoners of the Japanese, he lost a considerable amount of weight. As a prisoner of war, he endeavoured to maintain morale and discipline amongst his fellow prisoners. He was rewarded for his efforts by being made a Companion of the Order of the Bath and Mentioned in Despatches after the war. He also provided evidence in investigations of Bennett's escape from Singapore, of which he did not approve. Later life Callaghan retired from the Australian Army on 10 April 1947, having been made a major general earlier that year (with effect from 1 September 1942). After his retirement, he became involved with the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. Ill for some time, he died on 1 January 1967. The 8th Division Association honoured his death with a memorial service, and his remains were cremated.

The core of the current church was built in 1867 and has been expanded and remodeled since. The church is also used as a church school. On January 30, 1992, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance. When First Evangelical Congregational Church of Prairieville (as Waukesha was then called) was organized in 1838, it was the first Christian congregation organized in Waukesha County. The members met in homes and the log school house until 1840, when they built a small frame church on the southeast corner of Maple and Wisconsin Avenues. This building was the first Congregational Church building in Wisconsin Territory. With In the 1840s Waukesha became a center for antislavery sentiment, and some members of First Congregational were leaders, both in Waukesha and the Territory. In 1842 when Caroline Quarlls, who had escaped from slavery in St. Louis, found her way along the Underground Railroad to Waukesha, parishioner Lyman Goodnow drove her in a wagon under cover of night on her way to Ontario. In 1845, the congregation passed resolutions against slavery that received country-wide notice. In 1848 Ichabod Codding, who had edited the abolitionist newspaper _American Freeman_ became pastor. A member of the congregation took his place as editor of the paper. In 1867 the growing congregation decided to build a new, larger church. They sold their old church and built the new one at 100 E. Broadway. This 1867 building forms the core of the current building, but it was quite different from now. It was a frame building adapted from plan #2 in _The Book of Plans of the Congregational Union_. The floorplan was a simple rectangle and the style was Greek Revival, covered in clapboard. The 80-foot steeple rose above the front entrance, with the lantern and spire looking as they do today. By 1899 they needed more space and the congregation decided to expand the 1867 building. They hired the Milwaukee architectural firm of Crane and Barkhausen and added an ell to each side to convert the floorplan from rectangular to cruciform. The additions increased space for seating in the nave, the Sunday school, a kitchen, and the pastor's study. They also restyled the building to the more current Gothic Revival style, replacing many flat- topped windows with pointed tops. In 1922 the congregation decided the expand again. They covered much of the old clapboard exterior with brick, and added an 85 by 20 foot 1-story addition across the eastern end of the church. The addition is in a Tudor Revival style, with stucco and half-timbering. Inside, the addition made more space for Sunday school rooms and more space in the basement for dining and kitchen. In 1928, they added on again, adding a half- story above parts of the 1922 addition to add space for Sunday school rooms. In 1961 the church added a modern-styled education wing.

Stamler is credited with introducing the term \\"risk factors\\" into the field of cardiology. In 1988, he was awarded the Donald Reid Medal given by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for his contributions to epidemiology. He is professor emeritus of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. After his retirement from active teaching, he continued his research with his wife Rose until her death in 1998; he now divides his time between Manhattan, Pioppi (Southern Italy), Long Island, and Chicago.Jeremiah Stamler, MD (b.1919), profile in History of Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota Early life and education Stamler was born on October 27, 1919 in New York City, the son of George Stamler (a dentist) and Rose Baras Stamler (a former schoolteacher). Both of his parents were Russian Jews, immigrants from Russia. He was raised in West Orange, New Jersey, where the family moved when he was six months old. He attended Columbia University in New York as an undergraduate, and Long Island College Hospital Medical School (now SUNY Downstate Medical Center). Upon graduation, he was inducted into the Army, serving until 1946, when he was honorably discharged with the rank of captain. Career Stamler moved to Chicago in 1947, taking a job in cardiovascular research under Louis N. Katz. There he performed laboratory research on interactions of diet, hormones, blood pressure and lipids in experimental models of vascular disease, producing a classic monograph in 1958: Experimental Atherosclerosis. He moved to the Chicago Board of Health in 1958, where he set up the first Heart Disease Control Program (later the Chronic Disease Control Division). In 1972 he was appointed as chair of the newly formed Department of Community Health and Preventive Medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University.\\"Jeremiah Stamler M.D.\\", webpage from Northwestern University Department of Preventive Medicine (Viewed 2 February 2012) During the 1970s and 1980's his group took part in observational epidemiologic studies and in multi-center clinical trials of interventions to prevent coronary heart disease.

Bruce Memorial Award for Distinguished Contributions in Preventive Medicine from the American College of Physicians.  HUAC case  In 1965, Stamler, a longtime supporter of the civil rights movement for African-Americans, was subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (popularly known as HUAC). In response, he filed a suit (joined by co-worker Yolanda Hall, who had also been subpoenaed) seeking to have the committee's mandate declared unconstitutional, as it would tend to exert a \\"chilling effect\\" on the exercise of civil liberties. After the suit was rejected by U. S. District Court judge Julius Hoffman, Dr. Stamler filed an appeal; when the committee hearing began and his turn to testify came up, he cited the pending appeal of his suit and, refusing to testify until the suit had been finally adjudicated, walked out of the hearing. As a result, in 1966 he was cited for contempt of Congress and in 1967 he was indicted on that charge. In 1973, the government agreed to drop the indictment; in turn, Dr. Stamler agreed to drop his civil suit against the committee. HUAC, which had been renamed the House Committee on Internal Security in 1969, was abolished by the House of Representatives in 1975. According to John C. Tucker, \\"many people believe the Stamler case and a statistical survey prepared for it by University of Chicago law professor Hans Zeisel was the primary reason HUAC was finally disbanded by Congress\\".John C.

It serves patients in need both in Sri Lanka and around the world. The society is a non- profit organization and provides the tissues free of charge, except for a small fee on processing and delivery. History Deshabandu Dr. Hudson Silva, the founder and inaugural president of the society, launched the first campaign to collect corneas in Sri Lanka in 1958 as a medical student. The first set of corneas he received in 1959 were stored in his home refrigerator at Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo. Together with his wife, Irangani de Silva, he founded the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society in 1961. In 1964 they sent their first overseas donation to Singapore; the corneas were packed in ice in a tea thermos and hand-carried during the flight. Since then, conditions have improved and the organization has provided 60,000 corneas for corneal transplantation, for patients in 57 countries. Almost 900,000 people have signed up to donate their eyes through the society after their death. The society receives about 3,000 corneas a year and more than 2,000 are shipped abroad. The most prominent recipient country has been Pakistan (where the traditional Islamic law requires bodies to be buried whole and intact), with over 20,000 corneas. Egypt and Japan have received over 8,000 and 6,000 corneas, respectively. In Sri Lanka itself, citizens have first access to free corneas. In 2003, the United Nations Association of Sri Lanka joined with the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society to initiate the \\"Sight Project\\", with the aim of assisting patients in need of cornea transplants through United Nations Associations in their respective countries. Operation The society has over 450 branches in Sri Lanka, with a manpower of over 15,000 trained volunteers who are ready to remove donor eyes on demand. Extraction is done within 8 hours of death, packed in ice and received at the laboratory within 4 hours. The extraction process has to be handled with care, to avoid damaging Corneal endothelium, a thin layer of cells on the inner surface of the cornea that pumps water away to keep it clear. Transplantation is carried out within 5 to 21 days from the removal of the body, depending on the type of preservation medium used. The donated corneas are tested for HIV, hepatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases before use. Eye bank The Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 48 of 1987 set out the legal framework for tissue procurement and transplantation in Sri Lanka. Since then, the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society maintains the Sri Laknka International Eye Bank and Sri Lanka Model Human Tissue Bank, which is one of the largest in the world. The eye bank was established in late 1980s and the tissue bank in 1998. It is the first organization in the world that supplies or transplants corneas free of charge to the public. Cultural effects Sri Lanka is among the largest cornea providers in the world. The cultural background of the country has helped the organization to thrive in eye donation. The Buddhist concept of DƒÅna or giving, has been the root cause of its success, in a country which approximately 70% of the population is Buddhist. Hindus and Christians have also donated eyes via the society. Many famous individuals, including the late Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene, have donated their eyes upon death. Jayewardene's corneas were successfully grafted to two Japanese recipients.

In Alaska, it occurs in the north and in the central mountains. It also occurs in northwestern Canada, and in Norway and Russia,Salix hastata. Flora of North America. as well as various alpine or mountainous areas of Eurasia. Names The specific epithet hastata means \\"spear-shaped\\". Description Salix hastata as depicted in Flora von Deutschland, √ñsterreich und der Schweiz (1885) by German botanist Otto Wilhelm Thom√©. This willow varies widely in appearance, depending on environmental conditions. In general, it is a shrub growing 1 to 2 meters tall, but known to reach 4 meters. It forms thickets. The deciduous, alternately arranged leaves are up to 9.2 centimeters long. The leaves are often hairy, especially along the underside. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate plants. The inflorescence is a catkin up to 5 centimeters long. The flowers are pollinated mainly by bees. The seeds germinate immediately upon contacting the substrate. Habitat Thickets of the shrub occur on slopes and riverbanks in the Arctic, in alpine climates, and on tundra. It is a pioneer species, colonizing recently cleared habitat, such as floodplains that have recently been scoured by water. It also grows in recently burned areas. Associated species include Barclay willow (Salix barclayi), Alaska willow (Salix alaxensis), tealeaf willow (S. pulchra), Richardson willow (S. lanata ssp. richardsonii), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), alder (Alnus spp.), sedges (Carex ssp.), and mosses (Polytrichum ssp.). On the Alaska North Slope, S. hastata is a low-growing shrub. Sites that supported this and other low-growing willow species before being disturbed for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were observed to have been recolonized by low- growing willows within four years after disturbance ceased. Natural regeneration of low-growing willows such as S. hastata was successful on moist riparian sites with silty soils, where they were mixed with the taller Alaska willow (S. alaxensis), and on dry sites with fine-textured soils. Halberd willow and Barclay willow are similar in appearance and distribution, and misidentifications have been reported in some cases in Alaska; the two species can be distinguished by the presence of sparse reddish hairs on the main leaf vein of Halberd willow. These two species of willow can also form natural hybrids with each other. Varieties This willow species has a few recognized varieties: *S. hastata var. hastata L. *S. hastata var. subintegrifolia Flod. *S. hastata var. subalpina Anderss. *S. hastata var. alpestris Anderss. S. hastata var. farriae is now considered a distinct species known as Farr's willow (S. farriae). Ecology Halberd willow is a food source for a number of mammals and birds. It is, however, not considered an important browse for moose, as it is not as palatable compared to other willows such as Alaska willow, tealeaf willow, sandbar willow (S. interior), and littletree willow (S. arbusculoides). On the Alaska North Slope, low- growing willows such as Halberd, tealeaf, sandbar, and littletree willow are usually covered by snow during the winter, so they are not a winter food source for moose. Cultivation This species is cultivated in parks and gardens. The cultivar 'Wehrhahnii' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Other Uses Native Americans used parts of willows, including this species, for medicinal purposes, basket weaving, to make bows and arrows, and for building animal traps. In Yukon, willow leaves were chewed to treat mosquito bites and bee stings, as well as stomach aches.

Growing up in New York City, Semans listened daily to her mother's opera singing and took private piano and dance lessons of her own. This exposure to music, along with frequent trips with her governess to opera houses, theatres, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Semans an appreciation for art at an early age. While at one point she considered becoming a professional pianist, Semans stopped playing in college, a decision she said she later regretted. In an interview with North Carolina public television, Semans said that her love of the arts in combination with the Carolina area's lack of support for them inspired much of her philanthropic work. =Political career= For some time, Mary Duke Semans played an active role in the Durham City Government, although she never served in a post higher than a local office. In 1951 she ran alongside of Kathrine Everett for seats on the city council. They were both elected and together became the first two women ever on the board.\\"Mary D. B. T. Semans, Philanthropist and Activist\\", And Justice for All: Durham County Courthouse Art Wall; accessed November 10, 2013. From 1953-55 she then served as Durham's mayor pro tempore, again Durham's first woman elected to such a post. While in office, she spent much of her time pushing for civil rights, funding for the arts, and affordable housing and healthcare. , \\"Philanthropist Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans Dies\\", TheNonProfitTimes.com, January 25, 2012; accessed November 10, 2013. Philanthropy Semans created and supported many institutions at Duke University, in her hometown Durham, and in the larger State of North Carolina. Through these institutions Semans spent most of her life funding and promoting education, arts, and human rights in general.Kyle, Nicole & Chinmayi Sharma. \\"Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans dies at 91\\", dukechronicle.com, January 26, 2012; accessed October 29, 2013. =Duke University= Mary Semans financially supported many projects at her alma mater Duke University throughout her life. She spent many years as chair of the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, started by and named after her mother, and she served 45 years as a trustee of The Duke Endowment. In 1982 she became the Endowment's first female chair, a position she retained until 2001. Through her position she started the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation, the Josiah Charles Trent Collection of the History of Medicine, and the Mary Duke Biddle Scholarship. These projects were named after Josiah Trent, Semans's first husband, and Mary Duke Biddle, Semans's mother. She was also instrumental in the creation of the Duke University Museum of Art (later the Nasher Museum) and helped start Duke's Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies.Newton, Francis. \\"This issue is dedicated to the memory of MARY DUKE BIDDLE TRENT SEMANS\\", Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies. Vol. 43. Web. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, Spring 2013. =Support for the Arts= Growing up surrounded by the arts but finding herself in a city and area lacking them, Mary Semans and her husband concentrated much of their philanthropic energy towards supporting the arts. In 1956 Semans' mother, Mary Duke Biddle, started the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, and the next year Semans became trustee. A few years later in 1960, Mary Duke Biddle died and Dr. and Mrs. Semans became chairman and vice-chairwoman of the foundation. Through membership on this board they helped support many arts and cultural programs in New York City, the Carolinas, and Duke University.Williams, Wiley. \\"Mary Duke Biddle Foundation\\", NCPedia.org (2006); accessed November 12, 2013. The first of these programs, started in 1964 and named after Dr. Semans' parents, was an art collection at Duke University. \\"Timeline\\" , unctv.org; accessed November 12, 2013. Later in the 1960s Semans and her husband then helped start the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\\"In Memoriam: Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans\\", University Of North Carolina School of the Arts (2012); accessed November 12, 2013. At the time, the NC School of the Arts was the first publicly funded art school in North Carolina. In 1982, the same year Semans became President of the Duke Endowment, she and her husband established another two foundations but in their own names. The first, the Mary DBT Foundation, was founded as a general- purpose foundation for applicants, often artists, who couldn't find funding for projects elsewhere. The second, the Duke-Semans Fine Arts Foundation, was created very specifically to send artwork on tour to places that would otherwise never receive any. Of this second foundation, Mary Semans was the treasurer and Dr. Semans the President. Later in life, at age 77, one of Semans' last projects was the creation of the Semans Art Fund at the North Carolina School of the Arts. Through this foundation Semans could support individual NCSA students in their artistic endeavors, including student funding for research, summer tuition, performances, and special projects.\\"UNCSA Fellowships and Grants\\", UNCSA.edu; accessed November 12, 2013. Semans later said that of all her projects, the Semans Art Fund was closest to her heart. She said that like the students, she and her husband \\"needed to express [them]selves,\\" and being able to help the students in their endeavors fulfilled that need. Civil Rights Advocacy Though from a sheltered, upper-class background, Semans was known throughout her life as both a political and personal advocate for social rights. In an interview, she claimed to have first entered her city's political scene after attending a precinct meeting and seeing a racial division in a decision that would help Durham African Americans register to vote. Her involvement in that meeting led her to run for the City Council and eventually as Mayor of Durham on a platform of black voter registration.\\"A Hero Named Charles Rhyne\\" , DukeCheck.com, March 4, 2013; accessed November 12, 2013. Semans also served for 28 years as a trustee of Lincoln Community Hospital, a hospital started in 1901 by her family to serve Durham's African-American population. The Duke Family An infant Mary Semans with mother Mary Duke Biddle and grandfather Benjamin Newton Duke Mary Duke Semans' family along the Duke lineage was famous for its wealth and philanthropy before Mary was born,\\"The Duke Family\\", University Archives in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library; accessed October 30, 2013. starting a tradition she continued and influencing much of her life's work. =Family Wealth= The wealth of the Dukes first came into being through Washington Duke and the tobacco industry. Returning from the Civil War, Duke began traveling and selling tobacco from a wagon, and in 1874 he moved to Durham, NC with his family to expand his business and start W. Duke, Sons & Company.Durden, Robert. \\"Duke, Washington\\", NCpedia.prg (1986); accessed October 30, 2013. Facing competition from other tobacco manufacturers, the youngest of Duke's sons, James B. Duke, convinced his father to buy machines to make ready-made cigarettes, and within five years the W. Duke, Sons & Company became the largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States. Under the direction of James Duke it then merged with four other manufacturers to become the multinational American Tobacco Company.Durden, Robert. \\"W. Duke, Sons and Company\\", NCpedia.org (2006); accessed October 30, 2013. Later in 1905, James Duke worked with his brothers to create a second empire in hydroelectric power as an outgrowth of Duke investments in North Carolina's booming textile industry. They poured millions of dollars into hydroelectric infrastructure of the Carolinas, creating the Southern Power Company and what is now the United States' largest electric power holding company, the Duke Power Company.Durden, Robert. \\"Duke, James Buchanan\\", NCpedia.org (1986); accessed October 30, 2013. =Philanthropic Leanings= As the Dukes made money, they somewhat unusually for the time began to give much of their money to charitable causes.Durden, Robert. The Dukes of Durham: 1865-1929. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1975. 82-85. Washington Duke first came to philanthropy through the Methodist church, although he was influenced by the larger Social Gospel movement and had interest in quieting critics of his tobacco trust. The Duke family was involved in Methodist churches around Durham before they ever lived in the city, and over time much Duke money was spent on Methodist causes and the creation of Methodist churches. The biggest of these donations, encouraged mostly by Benjamin Duke, was $85,000 to Trinity College of Randolph County in effort to move it to Durham. In 1896, the Dukes gave Trinity College an additional $100,000 on the basis of admitting women, and accepting the offer, Trinity College received similar amounts in years following. In 1924, James B. Duke, the youngest son of Washington Duke, supported the vision of the then Trinity College President Dr. William Few and created the Duke Endowment with $40 million. The Duke Endowment then incorporated Trinity College into Duke University, named after James's father.Durden, Robert. \\"Duke University.\\" NCpedia. January 1, 2006. http://ncpedia.org/duke-university (accessed November 3, 2013). Later in her life, Mary Duke Semans would spend much time as the chairwoman of this still-existing Duke Endowment. Influences Semans' family, deeply connected to Duke University and philanthropy, greatly influenced what would become her own legacy. Starting with Washington Duke and continuing down to Semans' mother, the Duke's wealth and connections to Durham and North Carolina prompted them to spend much time and money giving to various causes. This history was not lost on Semans as she expanded upon their efforts: continuing Duke support of Duke University and concentrating especially on the arts. Semans also claimed that what first prompted her altruistic behavior was her experience in the Great Depression. While she and her family were not greatly affected, it was then when she first gained knowledge of others' terrible needs, leading her to believe that those of affluence have a responsibility to give. Awards Semans earned much recognition for her work. By the end of her life she had received the Duke University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service, the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the University Award from the University of North Carolina, the John Tyler Caldwell Award for the Humanities from the North Carolina Humanities Council, and the Hadassa Medical Center's Freedom Award, and in 2009 she was inducted into the North Carolina Women's Hall of Fame. She has also received honorary degrees from North Carolina Central University, Davidson College, Elon University, Shaw University, Pfeiffer University, Campbell University, UNC- Chapel Hill, and N.C. Wesleyan College. Dr. Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans was recognized as a Main Honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon 29 individuals \\"whose dedication, accomplishments and passion have helped shape Durham in important ways.\\" Death Semans died on January 25, 2012 at age 91 in Duke Hospital in Durham, North Carolina. The exact cause of death was not published. She is survived by seven children, sixteen grandchildren, and twenty-nine great- grandchildren. \\"Mary Semans, Champion of Duke and Durham, Dies\\", Duke Today, January 25, 2012; accessed November 25, 2013. Legacy Semans became involved with and started many charitable organizations throughout her life. She dedicated nearly her entire life to philanthropic work, yet she could never bear to think of her work as philanthropy. When asked for a reflection on her work, she replied that she \\"see[s] that word [philanthropy] all the time,\\" but never thought it applied to her. She was simply \\"giv[ing] to so and so\\" at times when they needed it.

In a career that lasted from April 1824 to August 1826 he ran eleven times and won eight races. Cedric was unraced as a two-year-old, but in 1824 he proved himself the best British colt of his generation by winning seven of his eight races including The Derby and the Grand Duke Michael Stakes. After winning a notable match on his first run as a four-year-old he lost his form and was well beaten in his remaining races. He was retired to stud at the end of 1826 but proved to be completely infertile. Background Cedric was a chestnut horse bred at Maresfield in Sussex by his owner Sir John Shelley, 6th Baronet. Shelley owned the stallion Walton and used him to breed Phantom, the Derby winner of 1811. Shelley then bred Phantom to a daughter of Walton, with the unusually inbred Cedric being the result. Phantom was British Champion sire in 1820 and 1824 and made his most enduring impact as the sire of the important broodmare Cobweb. Racing career Sir John Shelley bred Cedric, and owned him for all of his wins =1824: three-year-old season= Cedric did not race as a two- year-old and began his racing career at the 1824 Newmarket Craven meeting. On 22 April he made his debut in a 100 guinea Sweepstakes over the Ditch Mile course and defeated his only opponent, a colt named Banquo. Later the same afternoon he ran second to the filly Rebecca in the Dinner Stakes over the Rowley Mile. On the opening day of the next Newmarket meeting on 3 May he beat Cydnus to win a 200 guinea Sweepstakes, before reappearing three days later at the same course to win a match race, beating Lord Exeter's colt Progress. On 3 June Cedric started the 9/2 second favourite for the Derby at Epsom, with Thomas Thornhill's colt Reformer being made 5/2 favourite in a field of seventeen runners. Ridden by James \\"Jem\\" Robinson, Cedric won easily from the 16/1 outsider Osmond. Jem Robinson also won The Oaks on Cobweb and was married in the same week reportedly winning a very large bet on the completion of the triple event. Following his Derby win, Cedric was sent to Ascot where he won a three-horse Sweepstakes on the opening day of the meeting at odds of 1/4. A day later he started \\"long odds on\\" and won the one mile Winkfield Stakes from his only opponent. Cedric returned in autumn at Newmarket to face six other runners in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes on 4 October. He started 4/6 favourite and won from the Duke of York's colt Orion, with Don Carlos third. Cedric's owners claimed another prize at the next Newmarket meeting, when the Derby winner was allowed to walk over in a Sweepstakes after the other runners were withdrawn. =1825: four-year-old season= Cedric returned as a four- year-old in a match race at Newmarket on 19 April in which he received two pounds in weight from the five-year-old Bizarre, a horse who won the Ascot Gold Cup in both 1824 and 1825. In what was described as \\"the most exciting\\" and \\"the truest run race ever witnessed\\" the two horses ran together throughout the contest before Cedric pulled ahead to win by half a length . Officially, Cedric and Bizarre were three and four years old for this race as Thoroughbreds had their official \\"birthday\\" on 1 May: the modern practice of advancing a horse's age by a year on 1 January was introduced in 1834. Cedric's defeat of the Gold Cup winner was described as confirming his position as \\"the best in England\\" at the time. In June, Cedric was sold by John Shelley to John George Lambton for ¬£2,500 and his training base moved to Yorkshire. Cedric was off the racecourse for five months before reappearing in the Doncaster Cup over two miles five furlongs on 21 September. After winning his last seven races, Cedric started 5/2 second favourite, but finished unplaced behind Lottery. The Sporting Magazine's correspondent \\"Tyke\\" felt that Cedric was unsuited by the extreme distance. =1826: five-year-old season= On Tuesday 11 April, Cedric failed to appear for a match race, with Lambton paying a forfeit to the owners of his horse's opponent, Sligo. On 11 August Cedric ran in a two-mile race at York in which he finished last of the four runners behind Actaeon. Cedric was then retired from racing. Stud career Cedric began his breeding \\"career\\" at his owner's Lambton Grange stud in County Durham, where his initial fee for covering mares was ¬£10, or ¬£5 for a mare who had already produced a winner. His stud career was a complete failure as he proved to be infertile and failed to sire a single foal. Cedric died in 1829 of \\"inflammation\\" after standing three seasons at stud.

It spans the Ljubljanica River in Ljubljana. At the time of its construction, it was praised as elegant, very modern, and economical. Because it was later used to transport the dead from the Ljubljana hospital to the mortuary, it was nicknamed the Mortuary Bridge (), but has retained its beauty and technical perfection. Throughout history, both names have persisted. Since 2011, it has been located at an extension of Hren Street () between the Krakovo Embankment () and the Gruden Embankment (), connecting the Trnovo District and the Prule neighbourhood in the Center District. It has three articulated arches, each of them made of two parts, joined with a bolt by the principle of the charnier arch at the highest point of the arch. Technically, it quite surpasses the Iron Bridge in England. The elements are joined with screws instead of wedges, and reinforcing bars and hollow elements were used instead of full pylons, which has enabled the bridge to be much lighter, but stable. The Hradecky Bridge was manufactured according to the plans of the senior engineer Johann Hermann from Vienna at the Auersperg iron foundry in Dvor near ≈Ωu≈æemberk, and was installed as the first cast iron bridge in Ljubljana in 1867, at the location of today's Cobblers' Bridge. It was named after the former Ljubljana mayor Johann Nepomuk Hradeczky, who had the most merit for its construction. In 1931, when the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik planned the new Cobblers' Bridge, he moved the Hradecky Bridge further down the Ljubljanica near the former Ljubljana mortuary in the vicinity of Zalog Street (). The original gas lamps were replaced with decorative facets. In 2004, it was closed to traffic, and in 2009 a footbridge was built next to it. In 2010, it was removed from the location, renovated, and transferred to its current site in 2011. It is now used only by pedestrians and cyclists.

Brothers Annibale (1560‚Äì1609) and Agostino (1557‚Äì1602) along with their cousin Ludovico (1555‚Äì1619) worked collaboratively. The Carracci family left their legacy in art theory by starting a school for artists in 1582. The school was called the Accademia degli Incamminati, and its main focus was to oppose and challenge Mannerist artistic practices and principles in order to create a renewed art of naturalism and expressive persuasion. Art theory The artistic and theoretical activity of the Carracci is recognized by critics and historians such as Andr√© Chastel and Giulio Carlo Argan to have decisively contributed to the formation of the figurative Baroque and to new pictorial solutions based on the recuperation of the classical and Renaissance tradition, renewed by study of nature. \\"Jointly they effected an artistic reform that overthrew Mannerist aesthetics and initiated the Baroque.\\" The crisis of the culture of Catholicism was highlighted after the Protestant Reform (in 1517 Martin Luther expounded his 95 theses in Wittenberg), and the successive ‚Äúsack of Rome‚Äù by the troops of Charles V in 1527, facts that rendered the papal capital more insecure and unstable, and less attractive to the artists of the Roman epoch who at the end of the 16th century were less inclined to produce a new artistic movement. The mannerist art that wearily replicated the style of the masters of the Renaissance, emphasizing formal complications and virtuosity, no longer obeyed the need for clarity and devotion. Bologna was at the center of a territory in which the work of the artists traditionally had a pronounced devotional and pietistic character, and was influenced by north Italian and Venetian art. On these cultural and aesthetic bases the Carracci developed their work as theorists of artistic renewal, emphasizing the humanity of subjects and the clarity of the sacred scenes. The eclecticism of their art, the respect for tradition and a language adapted to the public places frequented by the working classes satisfied the desires of the church of the Counter-Reformation that needed a new mode to express its primacy over the other religions and confirm that art could and had to be a vehicle towards faith. The Carracci fit perfectly into the political and artistic moment of the epoch‚Äîthey recognized the need for an artistic style that could reflect the new desires and that was free from the artifice and complexity of Mannerism. Another principle of the Carracci doctrine was the devotional aspect, the respect of the orthodoxy of the represented history. The Carracci followed the instructions contained in the work of the theorists of the time such as the Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, author in 1582 of De sacris et profanis imaginibus (\\"on sacred and profane images\\") which advocated for the control on the part of the ecclesiastic authority of the contents of the sacred scenes (the saints and their attributes had to be easily recognizable and respectful of the traditional, additionally the stories had to demonstrate fidelity towards the sacred texts), while the artists retained the ‚Äúliberty‚Äù to choose the most suitable style. Another point of reference was the work of Giovanni Andrea Gilio, author of Due Dialoghi...degli errori dei pittori (\\"two dialogues...on the errors of painters\\") in 1564 in which he criticized the excesses of refinement, of allegories and the bizarre inventions of the Mannerist art. The stories and the characters rendered lifelike in imitation of nature had to then be ennobled by the exercise of the art and refined on the example of the great masters of the past such as Raphael and Michelangelo, but also Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto, Correggio, and Parmigianino. Agostino was also an important printmaker, reproducing the works of masters from the 16th century (mainly Correggio and Veronese) as examples to imitate for the numerous students of their school. Annibale was the most talented and the one who, following his trip to Rome in 1595 where the works would be exhibited until his death in 1609, exercised a decisive influence on the fate of Italian painting at the dawn of the 17th century. Accademia degli Incamminati Driven by the desire to explore and share their new-found approach to painting, the Carracci family collectively founded a school of art in Bologna around 1582. Initially named Accademia dei Desiderosi (‚ÄúAcademy of the Desirous‚Äù), the school most likely began as an informal gathering of young artists in Ludovico Carracci's studio. Around 1590, the academy was renamed Accademia degli Incamminati (‚ÄúAcademy of Those who are Making Progress‚Äù or ‚ÄúAcademy of the Journeying‚Äù), and adopted a more didactic academic programme. There is some debate regarding the school's organization and academic structure. However, it is likely that the academy functioned as a combination of a painters‚Äô workshop and a formal institution, and was attended by both students and established artists alike. Each member of the Carracci family made a unique contribution to the academy. It is believed that Ludovico Carracci occupied an administrative position, while Agostino was responsible for gathering new information, and Annibale for providing creativity, inspiration, and lessons on painting technique. Ludovico assembled and consolidated new materials to use as teaching aids, including a collection of plaster casts of classical works. Agostino brought to the school a wealth of knowledge in a variety of subjects, including art, music, philosophy, math, astronomy, geography, cartography, anthropology, and natural history. He used his knowledge of anatomy to construct detailed drawings of the human form, and provided books and medals from his own collection for the benefit of the students. Annibale, the most experienced artist of the group, shared his knowledge of painting via collaborative works with his pupils. The Carracci intended to provide the educated next generation of artists with an education that was valid both from a practical and theoretical point of view. The students were trained in a number of subjects to establish an intellectual background from which they could develop their artistic skill. Great emphasis was placed on the study of nature, and students were encouraged to practice drawing from life. The Carracci led their pupils in the study of experimental drawing, caricature, landscape painting, imitation, anatomy, perspective, and artistic theory. Students were also taught history, fables, and poetic inventions from which to draw inspiration. Notable students of the Carracci Academy include Francesco Albani, Guido Reni, Domenico Zampieri (Domenichino), Giovanni Lanfranco, Antonio Carracci, and Sisto Badalocchio. The opening of the Accademia degli Incamminati brought the Carracci name to great repute and attracted numerous commissions. These projects were typically allocated among the family by Ludovico or completed jointly by the three Carracci. Collective works There is much speculation and debate among art historians about which of the Carracci family members designed and executed various aspects of the frescoes that they painted. Extant preparatory sketches for the frescoes indicate that for each artwork, the preliminary sketches were likely created by all of the Carracci collaboratively. Likewise the finished frescoes would have been painted by all three of the Carracci but ‚Äúdespite much debate, there is no consensus among scholars as to the attribution of several scenes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen asked who had done each scene, the Carracci, having freely traded ideas and sketches, and having worked elbow to elbow, are claimed to have responded, ‚Äòit is by the Carracci, we did it together.‚Äô Such intimate collaboration, in which the individual style was sublimated in favor of a seamless, lively, and highly illusionistic effect, is characteristic of the Carracci's early period.‚Äù From 1583 to 1594, Annibale, Agostino, and Ludovico worked collaboratively to paint frescos on ceilings and walls of palaces in Bologna and Ferrara. One of their first joint commissions was the Palazzo Fava in Bologna. Here the Carracci painted frescoes of the Stories of Europa (1583‚Äì84), Stories of Jason (1583-84), and Stories of Aeneas (1586). The Carracci family's masterpiece, Stories of the Founding of Rome, was completed circa 1589-90, and is located in the main salon at the Palazzo Magnani-Salem in Bologna. In 1592, the Carracci went to Ferrara to decorate the ceiling of Palazzo dei Diamanti with scenes of the \\"Gods of Olympus.\\" The following years, 1593‚Äì94, the Carracci were commissioned to paint frescoes of New Testament scenes and figures in three rooms of the Palazzo Sampieri-Talon in Bologna. The popularity of the Carracci's frescoes at these Italian palaces (particularly the paintings at the Palazzo Magnani) caught the attention of another noble family, the Farnese. The Duke of Parma and Piacenza, Ranuccio VI, and his brother, Cardinal Odoardo approached the Carracci in 1593 and asked them to come to Rome to decorate the Palazzo Farnese. In 1594 Annibale and Agostino went to Rome while Ludovico stayed in Bologna. ‚ÄúThis summons signaled the end of the joint Carracci studio.‚Äù Works *Head of a Faun in a Concave (drawing in roundel, c. 1595, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC) *The Penitent Magdalen (private collection) *The Annunciation, Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris *The Lamentation, Hermitage, St. PetersburgAgostino Caracci, The Lamentation in the Hermitage *Reciprico Amore, Baltimore Museum of Art *Carracci's erotic work See also *Antonio Marziale Carracci References Further reading General Texts *C.C.

Biography Athanasiadis, after completing his piano and advanced theory studies (harmony, counterpoint, fugue) at the National Conservatoire of Athens, moved to London, England. He studied composition at the Trinity College of Music with Daryl Runswick, the Royal Academy of Music with Paul Patterson, and finally at the Canterbury Christ Church University where he obtained his PhD under the supervision of Roderick Watkins and Paul Patterson supported by the Research Studentship Award. In 2010, Athanasiadis was the recipient of the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship Award (2010‚Äì11). Based at the Tokyo University of the Arts as a Special Foreign Researcher, he composed new works for Western and Japanese instruments with a particular interest on the sh≈ç (mouth organ) and the 20-stringed koto. Some of those works were presented in a series of concerts culminating to a large- scale performance project that took place at the Sogakudo Hall on 23 January 2011. The same year he was awarded the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship Award (2011‚Äì13) for the second time to further his research and support the composition of new works for Japanese and Western instruments and their performance in both Japan and Europe. Athanasiadis' works are characterised by a strong visual identity; his performances has often been accompanied by dance or stage action. Early influences can be traced in Sergiu Celibidache's views on aspects of ambience and acoustic space (Athanasiadis attended Celibidache's Munich seminars in 1994), and in composers such as Christou, Feldman and Takemitsu. His most recent works focus on the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi, which has also been the main subject of his doctoral and postdoctoral research since 2004. Athanasiadis's music has been published by Oxford University Press and United Music Publishers and selected works have been released on CD by Dutton Epoch, Sargasso Records, Regent Records, Fonorum and the Choir & Organ magazine (cover CD for March/April 2009 issue). Performances Basil Athanasiadis's works have been performed in Europe, US, Canada and Asia by ensembles such as the London Sinfonietta, Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet, New London Chamber Ensemble, Silk String Quartet, Okeanos, Mondriaan Quartet, Alea III, Shonorities and choirs such as the BBC Singers, Wells Cathedral Choir, Cambridge Chapel Choir of Selwyn College, Montreal Christ Church Cathedral Choir.

The region lies to the north of South West Queensland and south of the Gulf Country. Central West Queensland is serviced by the ABC Western Queensland radio station. It has a population of approximately 12,387 people. History Barcoo River at Isisford, 2011 The first exploration by Europeans was by Major Thomas Mitchell who passed through the area in 1846. Mitchell was near Isisford on the Barcoo River when his party was lacking supplies and threatened by Aboriginals. He then decided to return to Sydney, completing a successful expedition which had explored a large area of unknown country. Geography Farming equipment along the Landsborough Highway at Ilfracombe, 2011 Winton, 2011 The eastern extent of the Simpson Desert lies within the region. Haddon Corner and Poeppel Corner on the Queensland border are also located here. Bioregions in the area include the Channel Country. Part of the Cooper Basin is located in the region. The basin contains the most significant on-shore petroleum and natural gas deposits in Australia. At the federal level the region partly falls in the Division of Maranoa and the Division of Kennedy. Local government areas included in the region are Shire of Barcoo, Shire of Diamantina, Shire of Boulia, Shire of Winton, Longreach Region, Blackall-Tambo Region and Barcaldine Region. =Geology= The Diamantina River‚Äôs hook-shaped upper reaches have drawn scientific attention. In March 2015, Geoscience Australia reported that the river‚Äôs course at and near its headwaters flows along the edge of a roughly circular crustal anomaly that might well be an impact structure. It is 130 km in diameter and lies some 60 km west of Winton; Middleton and Dagworth Station lie right in it. The asteroid impact, if indeed this is the explanation for the anomaly, would have happened roughly 300 million years ago. =Settlements= Major towns of Central West Queensland include Longreach, Winton, Blackall and Barcaldine. Barcaldine was the location for the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, one of Australia's earliest and most important industrial disputes. The Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame is a museum located in Longreach which pays tribute to pioneers of the Australian outback. The building was completed in 1987 and opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 April 1988. Smaller towns in the region include Bedourie, Birdsville, Boulia, Urandangi, Ilfracombe, Isisford, Yaraka, Jundah, Stonehenge, Windorah, Alpha, Aramac, Jericho, Tambo and Muttaburra. The ghost town of Betoota has been designated as Australia's smallest town. =Rivers= Waterways coursing through Central West Queensland include the Barcoo River, Georgina River, Diamantina River, Thomson River, Burke River, Hamilton River and Cooper Creek. =Protected areas= A number of national parks have been declared in the region, including Simpson Desert National Park, Cudmore National Park, Diamantina National Park, Astrebla Downs National Park, Welford National Park, Goneaway National Park, Lochern National Park and Bladensburg National Park. Transport Major roads in the region include the Capricorn Highway and the Landsborough Highway. In the north of the region, the Kennedy Highway leads from Boulia to Cairns on the eastern coast of Australia. The Central railway line reached Longreach in 1892. Today, the Spirit of the Outback is a long-distance passenger rail service operating from Brisbane to Longreach. The region is serviced by six airports, including Longreach Airport, Winton Airport, Windorah Airport, Barcaldine Airport, Aramac Airport and Blackall Airport.

Background Kikori was first a location for an oil pipeline in 1992, when the country‚Äôs first oil was pumped by Chevron from the oilfields around Lake Kutubu, via a 266 kilometre pipeline along the Kikori River to the Gulf of Papua. A new gas pipeline is being constructed to serve the LNG Project, which is due for completion in 2014. The gas pipeline is following the existing oil pipeline route through the Kikori River Basin to the Omati River Landfall, then sub-sea to a processing plant near Port Moresby. In May 2009 the government negotiated with landowner groups from the areas impacted by the LNG Project, and signed with them the Umbrella Benefits Sharing Agreement (UBSA), whereby the government agreed to share the benefits of the LNG Project revenue streams with the landowners. Following the signing of the UBSA, infighting broke out among landowners, as questions were raised about whether some landowners seeking infrastructure funding were entitled to the funding, as they were not impacted by the LNG Project. Promised Infrastructure Developments In November 2008 the Chairman of the KGPLA, Mark Sarong, announced plans to set up a PGK25.3 million [$10 million] helicopter flying school in Kikori to be run by KGPLA‚Äôs business arm, Gulf Air Limited, after the KGPLA signed a contract with Australian firm Webb Helicopters. The agreement was also to provide transportation services in the locality. Sarong also promised a set of infrastructure projects totalling more than PGK200 million in value. In November 2009 Mark Sarong made several public statements to the people of Kikori promising numerous infrastructure benefits. Sarong spoke of building mobile phone towers to provide greater telecommunication connectivity for locals, a PGK2 million KGPLA housing estate, a PGK3 million KGPLA marine livelihood project, and a PGK12 million road project in Kaiam. The government had recently released PGK8.6 million to the KGPLA out of the total of PGK17.6 million. Sarong also announced plans for a new Kikori township and park, an international airport and seaport, plans to support a trans-island highway, and plans to purchase fixed wing aircraft to add to Gulf Air Limited‚Äôs single helicopter operation. Controversies =Internal disputes= The KGPLA sued Mark Sarong, its Chairman, before the National Court of Justice in December 2009. The KGPLA was granted leave to move an ex parte application. In February 2010 the KGPLA sought an interim order against Sorong. =Fraud allegations= In January 2010 Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations Mark Maipakai, the member of parliament for Kikori, claimed to have uncovered a fraud amounting to PGK220 million [$84.1 million] involving Minister for National Planning and District Development Paul Tiensten, and a chairman of a landowner association in Kikori. Mark Maipakai questioned the release of funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in Kikori. The funds had been released by Paul Tiensten‚Äôs office without proper project submissions, status reports, accounting or acquittals. Maipakai alleged that the funds had been paid to four landowner associations, including the KGPLA, but the money had not been expended on any infrastructure projects. Paul Tiensten refuted the allegations, stating that the four landowner associations had signed the UBSA with the government, by which the government undertook to facilitate the release of infrastructure funds. In 2010 Mark Sarong was arrested and charged with misappropriation and conspiracy to defraud. Sarong was alleged to have conspired with the KGPLA accountant to fraudulently sign a Bank South Pacific cheque for a sum of PGK5,458,122 [$2.65 million]. He was released on bail of PGK5,000. However the three-month deadline given to the police to prepare the case papers elapsed, and in October 2010 the case was struck off by the Waigani magistrate‚Äôs court and the bail amount refunded to Sarong. In March 2012 Mark Maipakai, the MP for Kikori, was suspended pending an investigation into allegations of misappropriation of public funds. Community leaders complained that during the previous two parliamentary terms, despite Kikori being a LNG Project impacted area, there were no improvements in Kikori‚Äôs roads, health services, police services, or water services, contrary to campaign promises made by Maipakai during the 2002 and 2007 elections.

His mother was a daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare and the sister of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle. He inherited a substantial fortune from his mother's family.thepeerage.com William Vane, 1st Viscount Vane Career At the 1708 British general election, Vane was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for County Durham on his father's interest. He was active as a teller for various electoral disputes and voted for the naturalization of the Palatines, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. At the 1710 British general election, his father decided to drop him, so he did not stand. In 1720 Vane was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Vane, of Dungannon in the County of Tyrone, and Viscount Vane. These titles did not disqualify him from sitting in the House of Commons. He succeeded his father in 1723. At the 1727 British general election Vane was successfully returned in a contest for Steyning. At the 1734 British general election he was defeated at Steyning but returned in a contest as MP for Kent. However, he died suddenly only five days later. Personal life In 1703, he married Lucy Jolliffe, daughter of Sir William Jolliffe, of Caverswall Castle, Staffordshire. The settlement dated 15 November 1703 included Fairlawn, Kent, and lands in Durham, providing Vane with ¬£600 p.a. for himself and his wife. After the marriage, Vane's father refused to include Fairlawn in the settlement, and took ‚Äògreat displeasure‚Äô and stopped the allowance when his son took legal advice. The case came before the House of Lords and the settlement was confirmed. Vane kept possession of Fairlawn.

Life  The grave of William Tait, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh The eldest son of Isabella Bertram and her husband, James Tait (1762‚Äì1834), an architect in Edinburgh, he was born there on 11 May 1793. After a short time at the University of Edinburgh, he was articled to a writer to the signet. Giving up on a legal career, by 1818 he had opened a bookshop at 78 Princes Street, Edinburgh with his brother Charles Bertram Tait, and shortly afterwards began publishing. In 1833, Tait was elected to the first reformed town council of Edinburgh, and in the same year was sent to gaol for four days on 10 August for refusing to pay church rates, which were then a target in radical circles. His shop was a meeting-place and it is told that Sir Walter Scott and Thomas Carlyle were present at the same time without managing to meet. At this time he lived at 2, Walker Street in Edinburgh's West End.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1833‚Äì34 Tait retired from business in 1848, and bought the estate of Prior Bank, near Melrose, where he died on 4 October 1864. He is buried with his parents in St Cuthbert's Churchyard in Edinburgh at the west end of Princes Street. The grave lies on an outer wall of the southern extension.  Works  Tait's major publications were: Thomas Brown's Philosophy of the Human Mind; Thomas Carlyle's German Romance; the collected edition of Jeremy Bentham's works, and Patrick Fraser Tytler's History of Scotland. Tait's Edinburgh Magazine appeared in April 1832, and was issued monthly until December 1864. It was a literary and political magazine, its radical politics being its special feature, and giving it influence in Scotland, where it had for some time a larger circulation than any of its competitors. In 1834, it was reduced in price from 2s/6d (12.5p) to 1s (5p). At first, Tait was editor, but from 1834, when his magazine incorporated Johnstone‚Äôs, he used Christian Isobel Johnstone. Contributors included Thomas De Quincey, Leigh Hunt, Harriet Martineau, John Stuart Mill, and politicians such as Richard Cobden and John Bright who sympathised with the opinions of the magazine.

Door with five locks The Teyler legacy to the city of Haarlem is known today as the Teylers Museum, but in 1788 it was composed of two societies: Teylers First or Theological Society (Dutch: Teylers Eerste of Godgeleerd Genootschap), intended for the study of religion and Teylers Second Society (Dutch: Teylers Tweede Genootschap), which was to concern itself with physics, poetry, history, drawing and numismatics. The caretakers had to meet in the gentleman's room of the fundatiehuis weekly, and each society had five caretakers, so all of the gentlemen involved lived in Haarlem. From Teyler's death onwards, it was the home of the artist in residence, one of Teyler's many rules for the management of his estate. The first inhabitant after Pieter teyler died, was the local artist Vincent Jansz van der Vinne. =History of the building= The building was built in 1715 for the wealthy commissioner of the Haarlem City Justice department, Hendrik Adriaan van der Marck. Van der Marck had a large library and when he died in 1740 Teyler bought the house in order to have more room for his growing library and collection of curiosities and stuffed birds.Teyler 1778-1978:studies en bijdragen over Teylers Stichting naar aanleiding van het tweede eeuwfeest, by J. H. van Borssum Buisman, H. Enno van Gelder, Pieter Teyler van der Hulst , Schuyt, 1978, Teyler moved in with his wife, and they lived together there for 14 years until she died in 1754. The Teylers did not seem to take great pains to remodel the house, as the plaster work in the hallway downstairs still shows the Van der Marck family coat of arms. Upstairs in a back room, Teyler kept office (comptoir) as a banker, and this office still has the original cabinet with his banker archive. Two years after his wife died Teyler drew up his will with the intention of preserving the house as a gift to the city, though he himself lived for another 22 years. After Teyler's death The long hallway has the function of dividing the house in two, and the Teylers Stichting has used the various ground floor rooms for the location of the library and the meeting rooms for the directors, the religious society and the science society. The room at the back of the garden was used for member meetings. After the Oval Room was built, visitors could pass along the hallway through the meeting room to the Oval room. The old office used by Teyler himself became the office of the curator, and two smaller adjacent rooms with doors contain 3 and 5 locks, one for the Teylers Stichting and one for the science society, which held Teyler's coin and medal collection, the most valuable part of the collection on Teyler's death. The room with 3 locks could only be opened when all three key owners were present, and the room with 5 locks could only be opened when 3 of 5 keyholders were present. Considering the complicated lock system, there was clearly reason to fear theft of the items in the medal collection and in the early days the collection was only available by appointment.

He made two voyages to Australia. He was Naval Agent on the convict transport Kitty in 1792, and in 1803 the captain of for David Collins' expedition to found a new settlement in Port Phillip. Biography Woodriff was commissioned as a lieutenant on 1 April 1783, and received promotion to the rank of commander on 18 September 1795, and to captain on 28 April 1802. =Voyage to Australia= Towards the end of 1802 Woodriff was appointed to command of the , a 50-gun ship armed en fl√ªte, and fitted to transport convicts. They were bound for Port Phillip in the Bass Strait, on the southern extremity of Australia, with the intention of setting up a new settlement there under the command of David Collins. Calcutta sailed from Spithead on 28 April 1803, in company with the storeship Ocean, calling at Rio de Janeiro in July, and the Cape of Good Hope in August; they arrived at their intended destination in October. Calcutta then sailed alone to Port Jackson to take on a cargo of 800 tons of timber. Whilst in Sydney, Woodriff and the crew of Calcutta assisted in suppressing the Castle Hill convict rebellion. For this service Woodriff received a land grant near Penrith, New South Wales in 1804. Calcutta then before sailing back to England via Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro, arriving back at Spithead on 23 July 1804, completing a circumnavigation in ten months and three days. =Action of 26 September 1805= The Calcutta was refitted as a 50-gun ship, and sent to Saint Helena to escort merchant ships back to England. She arrived there on 3 August 1804 and sailed in company with six merchant ships back to England. Unfortunately, on 26 September, as the convoy approached the entrance to the English Channel, they encountered a powerful French squadron. Woodriff attacked, sacrificing his own ship in order to give the convoy a chance to escape, which all but one did, while the Calcutta was forced to surrender. Woodriff, his officers, and crew were landed at La Rochelle three months later, and marched to Verdun, away. In June 1807, Woodriff was released in a prisoner exchange, and promptly court-martialled for the loss of his ship. He was honourably acquitted, and his conduct was pronounced to have been that of \\"a brave, cool, and intrepid officer.\\" =Later career= In 1808 Woodriff was appointed agent for prisoners of war at Forton, near Gosport. Towards the end of the war he served as Resident Commissioner at Jamaica. He was admitted into the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, on 9 November 1830, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 26 September 1831, on the occasion of King William IV's Coronation Honours. Family He was born on 17 December 1756, the son of John Woodriff of Deptford, Kent. He married Asia Sumarel (1764‚Äì1827); they had three daughters, and three sons: Capt. Woodriff, Daniel James RN (1787‚Äì1860), Cdr. John Robert Woodriff RN (1790‚Äì1868), and Lt. Robert Mathews Woodriff RN (1792‚Äì1820).

History In 1895 Pearson first suggested measuring skewness by standardizing the difference between the mean and the mode,Pearson K (1895) Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution‚ÄìII. Skew variation in homogenous material. Phil Trans Roy Soc A. 186: 343‚Äì414 giving : \\\\frac{ \\\\mu - \\\\theta } { \\\\sigma } , where Œº, Œ∏ and œÉ is the mean, mode and standard deviation of the distribution respectively. Estimates of the population mode from the sample data may be difficult but the difference between the mean and the mode for many distributions is approximately three times the difference between the mean and the medianStuart A, Ord JK (1994) Kendall‚Äôs advanced theory of statistics. Vol 1. Distribution theory. 6th Edition. Edward Arnold, London which suggested to Pearson a second skewness coefficient: : \\\\frac{ 3 ( \\\\mu - u ) } { \\\\sigma } , where ŒΩ is the median of the distribution. Bowley dropped the factor 3 from this formula in 1901 leading to the nonparametric skew statistic. The relationship between the median, the mean and the mode was first noted by Pearson when he was investigating his type III distributions. Relationships between the mean, median and mode For an arbitrary distribution the mode, median and mean may appear in any order.Relationship between the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation in a unimodal distributionvon Hippel, Paul T. (2005) \\"Mean, Median, and Skew: Correcting a Textbook Rule\\", Journal of Statistics Education, 13(2)Dharmadhikari SW, Joag-dev K (1983) Mean, Median, Mode III. Statistica Neerlandica, 33: 165‚Äì168 Analyses have been made of some of the relationships between the mean, median, mode and standard deviation.Bottomly, H.(2002,2006) \\"Relationship between the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation in a unimodal distribution\\" Personal webpage and these relationships place some restrictions on the sign and magnitude of the nonparametric skew. A simple example illustrating these relationships is the binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.09.Lesser LM (2005).\\"Letter to the editor\\" , [comment on von Hippel (2005)]. Journal of Statistics Education 13(2). This distribution when plotted has a long right tail. The mean (0.9) is to the left of the median (1) but the skew (0.906) as defined by the third standardized moment is positive. In contrast the nonparametric skew is -0.110. =Pearson's rule= The rule that for some distributions the difference between the mean and the mode is three times that between the mean and the median is due to Pearson who discovered it while investigating his Type 3 distributions. It is often applied to slightly asymmetric distributions that resemble a normal distribution but it is not always true. In 1895 Pearson noted that for what is now known as the gamma distribution that the relation : u - \\\\theta = 2( \\\\mu - u ) where Œ∏, ŒΩ and ¬µ are the mode, median and mean of the distribution respectively was approximately true for distributions with a large shape parameter. Doodson in 1917 proved that the median lies between the mode and the mean for moderately skewed distributions with finite fourth moments.Doodson AT (1917) \\"Relation of the mode, median and mean in frequency functions\\". Biometrika, 11 (4) 425‚Äì429 This relationship holds for all the Pearson distributions and all of these distributions have a positive nonparametric skew. Doodson also noted that for this family of distributions to a good approximation, : \\\\theta = 3 u - 2 \\\\mu , where Œ∏, ŒΩ and ¬µ are the mode, median and mean of the distribution respectively. Doodson's approximation was further investigated and confirmed by Haldane.Haldane JBS (1942) \\"The mode and median of a nearly normal distribution with given cumulants\\". Biometrika, 32: 294‚Äì299 Haldane noted that samples with identical and independent variates with a third cumulant had sample means that obeyed Pearson's relationship for large sample sizes. Haldane required a number of conditions for this relationship to hold including the existence of an Edgeworth expansion and the uniqueness of both the median and the mode. Under these conditions he found that mode and the median converged to 1/2 and 1/6 of the third moment respectively. This result was confirmed by Hall under weaker conditions using characteristic functions.Hall P (1980) \\"On the limiting behaviour of the mode and median of a sum of independent random variables\\". Annals of Probability 8: 419‚Äì430 Doodson's relationship was studied by Kendall and Stuart in the log-normal distribution for which they found an exact relationship close to it.Kendall M.G., Stuart A.

He fought against the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598) (Seven Years' War), and won the battles of Geochang and Geumsan. He was one of those who recaptured the Sangju castle, captured the Japancese general in Goryeong, and recaptured Seongju, Hapcheon, Uiryeong, Kyungju and Ulsan. Jeong Ki-ryong was born in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province in 1562. His original name was Jeong Mu-su (Ï†ïÎ¨¥Ïàò; ÈÑ≠ËåÇÂ£Ω). He was the son of Jeong Ho, Fourth State Councillor (Jwachanseong Ï¢åÏ∞¨ÏÑ±). In 1586, he passed the military examination (Î¨¥Í≥º; Ê≠¶Áßë) and renamed Ki-ryong by the King's command. In 1590, he got to serve as a drill instructor under the Shin Rip, Commander of the Right Gyeongsangdo. When the war broke in 1592, he got promoted to manager, starting to serve under the Cho Gyeong, Marshal of the Right Gyeongsangdo. At that time, he has recommended to General Cho Gyeong a scheme to check an advance of Japanese army, as a consequence of complying his artifice, they have destroyed 500 of Japanese army in a Battle of Geochang. He has jumped in the Battle of Geumsan and saved Cho Gyeong who was captured by Japanese army as a prisoner of war, so he has got a nickname of a \\"Zhao Yun of Joseon\\" since his shape was very similar to the Zhao Yun who had rushed in the site of the combat in order to save a Liu Shan at the Battle of Changban. After then he defended against the Japanese armies' attack at Jeolla province as appointed as the Lord of Gonyang. In succession, after he was appointed the lord of Sangju which was lost by the Japanese army, he reseized that castle of Sangju by fighting with that Japanese army. As soon as the second war broke out against the Japan in 1597, his Joseon army broke the Japanese army Goryeong and captured the chief of the Japanese army alive. In succession, he reseized many castles such as Seongju, Hapcheon, Chogye, Uiryeong, Kyungju and Ulsan and then was promoted to Commander of the Right Gyeongsangdo. After he had led the Joseon-Ming combined forces in the year 1598, he swept the remnants of the defeated Japanese army in the areas of Gyeongsang provinces. General Jeong kept staying in Gyeongsang provinces and prepared to prevent the reinvasion of the Japan, though the war against the Japan ended in the year 1601. He was promoted as a field marshal (Sanghogun ÏÉÅÌò∏Íµ∞) in 1610, and after that as an admiral of the fleet he undertook the naval commander of the Three Provinces (Samdo Sugun Tongjesa ÏÇºÎèÑÏàòÍµ∞ÌÜµÏ†úÏÇ¨) and died in camp of Tongyeong in 1622.

History The Student Journals was founded in October 2010 by Siraj Datoo, a University of Warwick student and the website's managing editor, with Ali Gokal, a friend from Watford Grammar School for Boys. Datoo claims to be inspired by the editor of The Muslim News, Ahmed Versi, founder of a newspaper for Muslims who did not have a political voice in Britain. Datoo also felt that students needed a platform to express their opinion without any editorial bias, where every student could write, regardless of their political opinion. With Gokal's support, they went about creating the website. Aims When they launched the site, Datoo and Gokal set three main aims (as outlined on the site): To give university students a platform to express their opinions on a national scale, to present students the opportunity to be involved in journalism at a higher level (through interviewing high-profile personalities and attending events to review music, theatre, books and films as de facto members of the press.) They also state that they want to develop a journalistic style and help budding writers achieve their potential. It is for this reason that every article that is submitted to the site receives detailed feedback. The TSJ Advisors Scheme also serves this purpose. Awards and recognition =2013= Guardian Student Media Awards The Student Journals was named Website of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards after being shortlisted for the award for the second time in three years.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Central School c. 1909 (original building) Central School c. 1911 (addition being built) Central School c. 1919 (addition completed) Iron River constructed the first Central School just south of the site of the present building in 1884. The school was expanded in 1889, 1898, and 1902; the city built additional buildings, but the school system struggled to keep up with the booming population of Iron River. In 1902, a new school building was planned for the site, and the Milwaukee firm of Van Ryn & DeGelleke was engaged to design the building. However, construction did not begin until 1904, when Newman & Johnson were awarded a contract to construct the school. However, the new building was sufficient for only a few years, and in 1910 the school district engaged John D. Chubb of Chicago to design two wings and a boiler room, which were constructed in 1910-11. \\"Annexes,\\" likely separate temporary structures, were constructed in 1923, but removed some time later. Central School served as a high school until 1928, when the district built a new high school. After that, it served as a primary and secondary school, with a fluctuating student population as the economy fluctuated and as schools were consolidated. The school closed in 1980 and was used for storage afterward. The building was purchased by the Iron River Downtown Development Authority, and plans are being made to renovate it into an 18-unit cooperative housing structure, known as the \\"Apple Blossom Apartments.\\" Description With its Flemish gable ends, the school is a fine example of Dutch Colonial Revival-style architecture. The original building contained ten classrooms, lab and recitation space, and a 500-seat assembly hall. A contemporaneous account describes the original structure: ::The Central School in Iron River is an imposing and modern structure of two stories and a basement.... It is lighted with electricity and heated with steam and hot air, the air being forced into the rooms by means of a large fan. It also includes among its improvements an electric vacuum cleaning plant in the basement, which is probably the only one in operation in an Upper Peninsula school building. The 1910-11 wings added more classrooms, as well as a music studio, commercial room, stenographic room, dark room, and offices for school district personnel. {class=\\"wikitable unsortable\\" ! style=\\"background:light gray; color:black\\"Images of Central School c. 1919 File:Commercial Room Central School Iron River.jpgCommercial Room File:Cooking Room Central School Iron River.jpgCooking Room File:Science Room Central School Iron River.jpgScience Room File:Shop Room Central School Iron River.jpgShop Room } References  External links  Category:Defunct schools in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Iron County, Michigan Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:School buildings completed in 1905 Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Dutch Colonial Revival architecture in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Iron County, Michigan Category:1884 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Central School (Iron River, Michigan)"},{"id":"34503128","text":"The Bolshaya Lyampa () is a river in Perm Krai, Russia, a right tributary of the Uls which in turn is a tributary of the Vishera.

The missile is a reverse engineered and upgraded variant of China's Silkworm anti-ship missile. The missile was developed by the state-run Iran Aviation Industries Organization (IAIO). Iran reportedly began full production of the Ra‚Äôad in January 2004 and went into service in 2007. The missile is equipped for ground and ship-launched platforms.‚ÄúRa‚Äôad Cruise Missile,‚Äù in IHS Jane‚Äôs Air-Launched Weapons, 2012-2013, ed. Robert Hewson (United Kingdom: IHS, April 2012)  Development  During the Iran-Iraq War, China supplied Iran with numerous types of missile which included two variants of the Silkworm anti- ship missile, the HY-2 and HY-4. Prior to the post-war period, Iran's military was heavily dependent on foreign weaponry supplied mainly by the United Kingdom and the United States of America.Karsh, Efraim (25 April 2002). The Iran‚ÄìIraq War: 1980‚Äì1988. Osprey Publishing. pp. 1‚Äì8, 12‚Äì16, 19‚Äì82. In order to achieve independence and reduce foreign expenditure in the arms sphere, Iran engaged in a campaign of reverse engineering and producing any weaponry it possessed. The Ra'ad was one of the weapons which Iran reverse engineered. The Silkworm variant which the Ra'ad is based on exactly is unknown and disputed. However, some sources state that it is based on the HY-2 and others stating that it is based on the HY-4. It is unknown when the development stage began but it is known that the full production of the missile began in January 2004. The Ra‚Äôad was successfully test fired on 7 February 2007. This was confirmed by then Deputy Air Force Commander Ali Fadavi who said: ‚ÄúWe have successfully test fired a cruise missile called SSN4, or Raad, hitting targets 300 kilometres away in the Sea of Oman and northern Indian Ocean.‚Äù  Features  The Ra'ad is an anti-ship cruise missile that is capable of being launched from both surface and sea platforms. The engine of the Ra'ad utilizes a solid- propellant booster with a turbojet engine and employs an inertial navigation system and terminal guidance, the exact type of terminal guidance is unknown but IHS Jane's Weapons states that it is \\"likely infared imaging or an active radar system.\\"‚ÄúRaad (HY-1/-2 ‚ÄòSilkworm‚Äô variant/Pirouzi 75),‚Äù in IHS Jane‚Äôs Weapons: Strategic 2015-2016, ed.

It works on Windows, Linux, and other real-time and embedded operating systems. Building on this core IMDS, there are several editions supporting high availability, database clustering, hybrid (in-memory and disk-based) data storage, columnar layout of time series data (such as financial market data) and other specialized abilities.  History  McObject LLC introduced eXtremeDB in 2001, targeting embedded systems running in resource-constrained environments (i.e. with limited random-access memory and relatively low-powered central processing units). eXtremeDB characteristics appealing to this market include a small code size (approximately 150 KB), native C language application programming interface, available source code, and a high degree of portability (to support the varied processors and operating systems used in embedded systems). Early deployments by customers included integration in digital TV set-top boxes, manufacturing and industrial control systems, and telecom/networking devices. eXtremeDB emerged to manage what industry analysts, and McObject, portray as significant growth in the amount of data managed on such devices; the company claims eXtremeDB was the first embedded database management system (DBMS) developed specifically for such environmentsCold, hard data that‚Äôs deep, eeProductCenter (EE Times)2/28/05 Forrester Research, 11/13/2009Re-inventing embedded database technology for embedded systems and intelligent devices.

A ‚Äúsequences‚Äù data type supports columnar data layout and enables eXtremeDB to offer the benefits of a column-oriented database in handling time series data. The Financial Edition also provides a library of vector-based statistical functions to analyze data in sequences, and a performance monitor.  Benchmarks  McObject published reports on benchmark tests employing eXtremeDB. Main-Memory vs. RAM-Disk Databases: a Linux-Based Benchmark examined IMDS performance versus that of a traditional on-disk DBMS deployed on a RAM disk, on identical application tasks. The benchmark‚Äôs stated goal was to test the thesis that an IMDS streamlined architecture delivers a performance benefit beyond that provided by memory-based storage.Examining Main Memory Databases , iApplianceWeb, 1/4/2002 Another benchmark, the Terabyte-Plus In-Memory Database System (IMDS) Benchmark, documented IMDS scalability and performance in the size range of large enterprise application (versus embedded systems) databases. For the test, engineers created a 1.17 terabyte, 15.54 billion row database with eXtremeDB on a 160-core SGI Altix 4700 system running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9.Terabyte-Plus In-Memory Database Benchmark, www.mcobject.com In November, 2012 a marketing report was published for Dell servers with Mellanox InfiniBand.

The family includes 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol- isomerase (5-keto 4-deoxyuronate isomerase) (KduI) and 5-deoxy-glucuronate isomerase (5DG isomerase) (IolB). KduI is involved in pectin degradation by free-living soil bacteria that use pectin as a carbon source, breaking it down to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which can ultimately be converted to pyruvate. KduI catalyses the fourth step in pectin degradation, namely the interconversion of 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate and 2,5-diketo-3-dexoygluconate. KduI has a TIM-barrel fold. This family also includes several bacterial Myo- inositol catabolism proteins, such as IolB, which is encoded by the inositol operon (iolABCDEFGHIJ) in Bacillus subtilis. IolB is involved in myo-inositol catabolism. Glucose repression of the iol operon induced by inositol is exerted through catabolite repression mediated by CcpA and the iol induction system mediated by IolR. Members of this family possess a Cupin like structure.

He fought on the Royalist side during the English Civil War, but later made his peace with the Cromwellian regime. In his later years he openly professed the Roman Catholic faith, which was then illegal. Background He was born at Merrion Castle, which was situated at present- day Mount Merrion, Dublin, the youngest son of Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount FitzWilliam and Margaret Plunkett, daughter of Oliver Plunkett, 4th Baron Louth and Frances Bagenal.Lodge, Edmund Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage Saunders and Otley 1832 p.152 The FitzWilliam family were first recorded in Ireland about 1210, and by the seventeenth century they had become among the largest landowners in Dublin. They had a record of loyalty to the English Crown, and the viscountcy was conferred on the elder Thomas in 1629 by Charles I in recognition of his good services to the Royal cause. The title did not come cheap since the Crown expected financial help in return, and the Fitzwilliam estates were mortgaged in the 1630s to cover the cost of the family's gifts to the Crown.Ball, p.12 Civil War and Restoration As a young man William appears to have lived in the shadow of his elder brother Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. When Oliver became a Colonel in the French Army, William was his lieutenant. Both gained the trust of Charles I of England, and while Oliver returned to fight in Ireland, William became Governor of Whitchurch and Lieutenant General for Shropshire.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol. 2 pp.14, 20 When it became clear that the Royalist cause was lost, Oliver and William both made their peace with Oliver Cromwell and in 1655 after the deaths of their father and their eldest brother Richard, a portion of the family lands were restored to them. Before the fighting became serious, William and his wife and family had lived at Dundrum Castle, but they were driven out in 1642, returning again in 1646. In about 1652, the Fitzwilliams left Dundrum and did not live there again. Their later home was Simmonscourt Castle, where they were living shortly after the Restoration of Charles IIBall, p.20 In 1667 on Oliver's death William became the 3rd Viscount Fitzwilliam. As Oliver had no children, and their next brother Christopher had also died leaving an only daughter; the Earldom died with Oliver.Lodge, p.152 William enjoyed his title for only three years. He seems to have preferred to live in Dublin City rather than at Merrion Castle, which was then some distance from the city. He died at his town house in the parish of St. Nicholas Within, near Christ Church Cathedral,Ball, p.20 whose bells he had rung on his death in 1674.H., 'Adversaria Hibernica: Literary and technical', The Irish Builder, xix, 410 (15 January 1877), 20, 23, online at https://archive.org/details/irishbuilderengi1918unse/page/20/ Religion Encouraged perhaps by Charles II's well-known inclination to the Catholic Church, which he entered on his deathbed, William, despite the Penal Laws, openly practiced his Roman Catholic faith. At his death he was attended by several Catholic priests, and though like his brother Oliver he was buried in Donnybrook Church the burial service was conducted according to the Catholic rite. His son and heir Thomas was also an open Catholic, while his daughters married into untitled Catholic families rather than the Protestant nobility.Ball, p.20 Family William married Mary Luttrell, daughter of Thomas Luttrell of Luttrellstown Castle and his second wife Alison St Lawrence, daughter of Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth.

The three ‚Äútracks‚Äù are broadly differentiated by levels of influence and formal organisation, and can be summarised as follows: Track 1: Political elites and decision-makers Track 2: Civil society and local government, influencers, think tanks and researchers Track 3: Communities and individuals within the broader population Connecting these tracks can help societies move towards a situation in which high-level policies are informed by the knowledge and experience of local communities, and which therefore reflect local realities. This is the essence of the ‚ÄúTrack 6‚Äù approach: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Interpeace‚Äôs mandate is based on two core pillars. The first is strengthening the capacities of societies to manage conflict in non-violent, non-coercive ways by assisting national actors in their efforts to develop social and political cohesion. The second involves assisting policy-makers at the national and international levels to play a more effective role in supporting peacebuilding efforts around the world. The Track 6 approach helps Interpeace bring those pillars together, ensuring that lessons learned in the field are understood and applied, to continue the evolution and improvement of peacebuilding practice.

He carried out research, mostly in High Energy Astrophysics, in Italy, France, United States and at the European Southern Observatory. Biography Pacini was born in Florence on 10 May 1939, however he moved early on to Urbino. His parents were Gualtiero Pacini, a teacher from Urbino and Elsa Roesch, born in Baden, Switzerland. Pacini was married in 1966 to Rosemary Winterer, a teacher, born in St. Louis, Missouri. They had three children: Giulia, Tommaso and Giorgio. Pacini graduated from a local high school, Raffaello, in Urbino. He studied physics at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and later at the Sapienza in Rome, where he graduated in 1964. Pacini's thesis (Livio Gratton was his advisor) was about neutron stars, which were hypothetical objects at the time. Pacini continued to work on neutron stars at Institut d'astrophysique de Paris, where he was a post-doctoral fellow. Pacini continued his research on neutron stars at the Institute d'Astrophysique in Paris. From 1967 to 1973, he was research associate and visiting professor at Cornell University. In 1967 he published in Nature the first specific suggestion that strongly magnetized neutron stars could release their rotational energy and produce a large flow of relativistic particles. The discovery of pulsars in Cambridge (UK) proved the correctness of his hypothesis a few months later by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish of University of Cambridge. In 1968 in another Nature article, Pacini wrote that at the center of the Crab nebula would be found a pulsar, which would explain the emission of electromagnetic radiation. Crab Nebula The discovery of the strong infrared emission from some starburst galaxies, Pacini, together with Martin Harwit, suggested that these sources are related to an evolutionary stage of a galaxy during which massive stars are being formed, a scenario which is now generally accepted. In 1975 Pacini joined the newly created scientific group of the European Southern Observatory in Geneva; Pacini served as President from 1975 to 1978. He was instrumental also for Italy to enter into the ESO. On returning to Italy in 1978, he became Director of the Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory in Florence and a professor at the University of Florence. He held this post until 2001. During his tenure the Observatory greatly expanded its scientific activity in different areas, in a broad context of international collaborations. In particular, during this period the Arcetri Observatory became partner in the construction of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). In 1982 Pacini was one of the 69 signatories signing a petition circulated by Carl Sagan: Extraterrestrial Intelligence: An International Petition. Pacini had an ability to use humorous images when talking about science, as can be read in article by Virginia Trimble and Markus Aschwanden: What is in the jets? Franco Pacini is supposed to have said that relativistic tomatoes would do. He was member of a large number of international boards and committees. He was President of the International Astronomical Union for a three-year period (2001‚Äì03). He was Member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Associate Member of the Royal Astronomical Society and Member of the American Astronomical Society. At the 25th General Assembly of the IAU, held in Sydney in 2003, he proposed to designate 2009 the International Year of Astronomy as a way to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first telescopic observations. Asteroid 25601 Francopacini is named after him. In 1997 he received the Prize of the Italian Government for Science. Over the years he carried out a wide range of activities aimed at communicating science to the general public, including children and adults, with frequent public lectures, popular articles in newspapers, books and appearances on television. Pacini was involved in starting Children's Day at Arcetri Observatory. He also wrote five children's books.

It is among the oldest civic societies in the United Kingdom. Purpose The society advertises itself as being \\"for all those who love London\\". Its original motto was \\"Antiqua Tegenda, Pulchra Petenda, Futura Colenda‚Äù, Latin for \\"look after the old, seek the beautiful, cultivate the future\\". It was agreed at the Society's Annual General Meeting in 2018 that a new motto would be adopted: \\"Valuing the Past; Looking to the Future\\", which came into effect in 2019. The society's journal states that \\"the Aim of the Society is to stimulate a wider concern for the beauty of the capital city, for the preservation of its charms and the careful consideration of its developments\\".This is stated on the inside page of each edition from No.466 onwards (Autumn/Winter 2014). History The London Society was founded on the back of the town planning movement in the early 20th century. In the year following the first planning act of 1909 the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) held a London conference which focused attention on the capital city, and the Architectural Review began a town planning supplement. In its first issue the architect David Barclay Niven wrote a paper on the need for new roads and a system of parks in outer London before the area was swamped by new development; his ideas chimed with those of George Pepler who gave a paper at the RIBA conference suggesting that a voluntary body might undertake inquiries into London's needs and lead public opinion. The London Society became this body. The society was formally inaugurated on 9 February 1912 at a meeting at the Galleries of the Royal Society of British Artists. The minutes of the first meeting indicate that it was attended by only ‚Äòa few men keenly interested in the artistic development of London and the protection of its beauty and character‚Äô.London Society, Development Plan for Greater London, 2012 Two weeks later, the society adopted its name and settled its objects as being ‚Äòto foster an intelligent interest in London as the largest civic centre‚Äô and ‚Äòto induce a public spirit for the study and encouragement of its improvement‚Äô.Lucy Hewitt (2011), Towards a greater urban geography: regional planning and associational networks in London during the early twentieth century, Planning Perspectives, volume 26, issue 3. The Earl of Plymouth accepted the position of president of The London Society. Niven took the chair at the first meeting in 1912, though he was soon succeeded by the weightier figure of Aston Webb. By the third meeting on 9 February 1912, 160 people were present. Those who had been promoting the need to prepare a plan for London at the Town Planning Conference were quick to join. This included politician John Burns, planner Sir George Pepler, and architects William Edward Riley and Arthur Beresford Pite. The society was launched to the general public on 13 January 1913 at a meeting held at the Mansion House, under the presidency of the Lord Mayor, Earl Curzon of Kedleston (later the 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston) who delivered an address that neatly described its objects as being \\"to make London beautiful where it is not so already, and to keep it beautiful where it already is\\".Webb, A (ed.), London of the Future, London Society, 1921, p.17 The fledgling Society attracted wide coverage and interest. By the end of 1913 the society's membership was over 400, including 65 MPs and peers, 9 members of the London County Council and many practising architects and surveyors. Early members also included planners, engineers and artists. Its formation partly reflected a shift from a 19th-century philanthropic approach to urban reform to a more professional and democratic attempt to planning of the whole urban environment.Helen Beaufoy (1997), Order out of chaos: the London Society and the planning of London 1912‚Äì1920, Planning Perspectives, volume 12, issue 2, pp.135-164. It predated the establishment of the Royal Town Planning Institute in 1914. The journalist Thomas Raffles Davison wrote: :\\"The chief issue is the good of London, its orderly and beautiful development, its general amenity as a place for business or pleasure\\", and that the Society‚Äôs role was \\"to think about the Future of London and its improvement\\" as well as \\"the jealous preservation of all that is old and beautiful in London as far as is possible.\\" Sir Bruce Ingram, Lord Northcliffe and George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell brought press fire-power. Bruce Ingram was managing director of The Illustrated London News and The Sketch, Lord Northcliffe who was vice president of the society by 1919 owned The Evening News (a London newspaper), The Times and the Daily Mail, whilst Sir George Riddell, who was on the society's council, was managing director of the News of the World. Viscount Hambledon was proprietor of WHSmith. The society developed the first Development Plan of Greater London (1919) which influenced thinking about shaping places and the post-war planning put forward in Patrick Abercrombie‚Äôs Greater London Plan (1944). This was the first attempt to envisage the management of London as a functional metropolitan region and a key step in developing the notion of a green belt. The first major project to be taken up by the society, the Development Plan pulled together many of the ideas for roads and open spaces being canvassed in the years before the Great War. War delayed this work though preparation of the plan provided some employment for architects when new building more or less ended. The plan was completed in 1917 but government controls prevented its publication until the end of 1918. The Metropolitan Police had covered a wide area since its establishment in 1829 but otherwise the concept of a Greater London to be planned as a whole was forward-looking and not given administrative force until the establishment of the Greater London Council in 1965. When Patrick Abercrombie was asked to draft a plan for the LCC area in 1941 he commented that he would only do it if he could follow the lead of the London Society and do a plan for Greater London as well. By the early twenty- first century the society's activities had begun to focus increasingly on heritage and conservation. For this reason, following its centenary in 2012, the society's executive committee proposed merging the organisation into the Heritage of London Trust (HOLT). This prompted an influential group of professionals to intervene and set out an alternative vision for the future, instead making the case for retaining and reinvigorating the charity with a renewed focus on its original objects. A vote was taken amongst members of the society at an Extraordinary General Meeting in December 2013. This prevented the merger and the society was formally relaunched in September 2014 by a new executive committee. Modern society Membership of the London Society is open to all. The society is supported by a range of patrons and members, both organisational and individual. *President: The current president is Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. *Vice-Presidents: Lord Richard Rogers, Sir Terry Farrell, the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the Dean of Westminster, Lady Duncan Sandys, Mrs R Boyes-Watson, Mrs Benita Jones, Mr Ian Jones and Mr S J Teague. *Committee: Peter Murray (chairman), Neil Bennett and Clive Price (both vice- chairman), Mark Prizeman (secretary), Nick McKeogh (treasurer) and Jessica Cargill Thompson (editor). Other committee members include Michael Coupe, Richard Harden, Jonathan Manns, Lucy Smith and Eric Sorensen. *Director: Don Brown Notable members The founding members of the society were \\"an extraordinary assemblage of the Great and the Good\\".Hall, P., Cities of Tomorrow: An Intellectual History of Urban Planning and Design, Blackwell, 2014 Its first chair was Aston Webb. Its vice-presidents included Lord Curzon, former Viceroy of India, John Elliot Burns, then president of the Local Government Board, Lord Northcliffe, owner of The Times, and retail tycoon Gordon Selfridge. In March 1914 The Builder commented that \\"architects are the backbone of the London Society\\". Indeed, notable early members of the council and executive committee include Sir Edwin Lutyens, Raymond Unwin, Sir Aston Webb, Stanley Davenport Adshead, Arthur Beresford Pite, David Barclay Niven,David Barclay Niven, Dictionary of Scottish Architects - http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100247 Leonard Stokes and Reginald Blomfield. The architectural legacy of many of these early members is evident both within London and beyond: Lutyens was architect of The Cenotaph and New Delhi, Unwin designer of garden cities such as Welwyn and Letchworth and Hampstead Garden Suburb, Webb as architect of the front fa√ßade of Buckingham Palace and the V&A; Museum, and Adshead as president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Those from beyond the architectural professions included illustrator Thomas Raffles Davison, artist and president of the Royal Academy, Frank Brangwyn (who studied under William Morris and worked alongside Diego Rivera and Josep Maria Sert to decorate the concourse of the RCA Building in New York), publisher J. M. Dent (producer of the Everyman's Library series) and politician Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath. Painter and past director of the National Gallery, Sir Edward Poynter, joined in 1913. So too did Sir Thomas Brock, sculptor of the Queen Victoria memorial. Lady Feodora Gleichen, the first woman to be made a member of the Royal Society of Sculptors, joined in 1919. At the time of the 2014 saving and relaunch, the executive committee comprised: Peter Barber, Peter Bishop, Patricia Brown, Michael Coupe, Benjamin Derbyshire, Kathryn Firth, Martin Hart, Edward Jones, Jonathan Manns, Nick McKeogh, David Michon, Peter Murray (chairman), Clive Price, Mark Prizeman, Eric Reynolds, Eric Sorensen and Deyan Sudjic. Journal The Journal of the London Society was first produced in 1913, and, while the format has changed over time, it has been published ever since. It is now published twice a year and distributed free of charge to members. The current editor is Helen Parton. Past Editors include former deputy editor of Time Out London Jessica Cargill Thompson and Booker-nominated Philippa Stockley. White papers From its earliest days it has produced reports and contributed to debates about the future of London and various of its landmarks (e.g. London churches, Euston Arch, the British Museum, etc.). Indeed, a collection of essays published in 1921 was entitled London of the Future.http://www.discoverlondonbridge.co.uk/default.aspx?m=26&mi;=172&ms;=60&title;=Regeneration In this context, the society has historically played a significant ‚Äòthought leadership‚Äô role.Journal of the London Society, No.467 (Spring/Summer 2015), p.44 To continue this work the society in 2014 launched a series of occasional white papers by those at the forefront of debate about the city. These are considered on their merit. They are professionally rigorous, peer-reviewed and intended to direct discussion about the evolution of London. Those published to-date include: Green Sprawl: Our current affection for a preservation myth? (2014) The society's first white paper was authored by the English urban planner and surveyor Jonathan Manns. It provides a comprehensive history of the evolution of London's green belt from the 19th century until the 1960s and contextualizes this with a consideration of that which existed in the early 21st Century. Regarded as \\"an excellent historical account of the establishment of the Green Belt around London\\",Planning Officers Society, Planning for a Better Future: Our Planning Manifesto for the Next Government, Aylesbury, March 2015 the report attracted wide coverage and prompted an update of the House of Commons Standard Note on Green Belt (SN/SC/934) and subsequent Research Briefings.House of Commons Library, Standard Note on Green Belt, SN/SC/934, December 2014House of Commons Library, Briefing Paper: Green Belt, Number 00934, June 2015 The most widely reported element within the public media was its emphasis on the need to \\"move away from the simplistic and na√Øve idea that that countryside is a sacrosanct patchwork of medieval hedgerows and towards an empirically informed position which once more recognises housing as a need to be met in locations with appropriate environmental capacity.\\"\\"London's green belt isn‚Äôt sacrosanct ‚Ä¶ we need to build homes on it\\", Jonathan Prynn, Evening Standard, 9 December 2014 Manns said: :\\"This means asking ourselves how best to meet the challenges faced today in an holistic and strategic manner. Would we devise the current green belt if we started again today and do we actually need the green belt in certain places? It emerged as an idea that flexibly evolved and adapted to respond to the perceived challenges facing each generation. We can and should have the confidence to build on these achievements and re-envisage it for those that follow.\\"http://ihbconline.co.uk/newsachive/?p=9292 \\"The London Society: Green Belt a ‚Äòcurrent affectation‚Äô?'\\", IHBC NewsBlog, Institute of Historic Building and Conservation, 9 December 2014 Building Greater London: An end to the Capital's crisis of affordability (2015) Written by Ben Derbyshire, English architect (managing partner of HTA Design), it considers London's housing shortage at the start of the 21st century and proposes solutions, including a strategic revamp of the structure of governance for the economic region of Greater London and consideration of the kinds of housing solutions that the leadership of such an entity could pursue. Looking to examples from elsewhere in the world, the implication of Derbyshire's work is that London has fallen behind; he told Building: \\"Melbourne has built example homes of different kinds all around its central business district, San Francisco has got a larger area with greater powers and is encouraging a more diverse offer\\".\\"Greater London 'needs housing revolution'\\", Tim Clark, Building, 7 April 2015 He said: :\\"The people most adversely affected by the affordability crisis are London‚Äôs young who are struggling to find places to live in the city, yet on the other hand they are the entrepreneurial seedbed of the city‚Äôs future.\\" Re/Shaping London: Unlocking Sustainable Growth in West London and Beyond (2016) Jointly authored by Jonathan Manns and Dr Nicholas Falk, this paper sets out recommendations as to how planning could be done better in England and gives consideration to the opportunities in West London. It was published by the London Society and commissioned by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for London's Planning and Built Environment. The most publicized idea was for a 'green web' to replace the 'green belt' in some locations, with the ambition being to create a \\"multifunctional green infrastructure landscape\\" in which new-build and publicly accessible natural space sat side by side.Dunton, J., \\"Report backs 'green web' plan for London\\", Planning Resource, 21 October 2016.Edgar, L., \\"Replace London‚Äôs green belt with ‚Äògreen web‚Äô to deliver housing\\", The Planner, 21 October 2016. It also calls for a new Garden City at Northolt Airport and a new orbital railway linking Uxbridge and Staines via West Drayton and Heathrow. Huq, who chairs the APPG, said: :\\"It is only through innovative fresh-thinking such as this that we can begin to chart a course towards the type of cities in which we wish to live.\\"Clark, T., \\"Report says use green belt to build 200,000 homes in west London\\", Building Design, 21 October 2016. Political Influence London's parliamentarians have a close historic involvement with the society. In the early years the political diversity and influence of the society was particularly notable, not least because the Government remained cautious of state intervention in built environment issues. Early Liberal members included Viscount Cowdray and Walter Morrison, whilst Conservatives included the Earl of Crawford and Sir George Touche; all were members of the Parliamentary Committee by 1919. More widely, founding member John Adams was committed to the Marxist Democratic Federation (later the Social Democratic Federation) whilst Lady St Davids was an influential campaigner for women's rights. By 1920 the Parliamentary Committee had 40 members, which included the majority of London MPs and Peers. This connection to Parliament was re-established with the launch of the UK Government's All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on London's Planning and Built Environment in October 2015, for which the society provides the secretariat. When launched, the APPG was the first cross-party group to focus on London's planning and built environment for some 50 years. The first chair was Rupa Huq and vice-chair Paul Scully, with the Bishop of London being Lords liaison and Helen Hayes acting as treasurer.Edgar, L., \\"London Society inaugurates APPG for London‚Äôs Planning and Built Environment\\", The Planner, 23 October 2015 Library The library is a research resource for matters relating to the history of London and contains over 3,500 items. It is held at Mortimer Wheeler House. Its contents include books, periodicals, maps, press cuttings, letters and drawings. Access is available to members on request. Activities Society events include member visits to places of interest, keynote lectures (including the annual Banister Fletcher Lecture), debates and social events. These are intended to bring together those with a particular interest in the city, whatever their age or interests. Recent speakers have included Stephen Bayley, Rowan Moore and Robert Peston. Banister Fletcher Lecture Sir Banister Flight Fletcher (1866‚Äì1953) was an English architect and architectural historian. He was president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) from 1929 to 1931. With his father he co-authored A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method (1896) which became the standard architectural textbook for much of the twentieth century. Banister Fletcher was an early member of the society and his will provided a small bequest to the society on condition that it held an annual lecture in his name, which was inaugurated upon his death.

The building is named for one of the commissioners of the township at the time its construction was commissioned. Due to the isolation of the Copper Basin from major population centers in the state, the building was never used for its intended purpose. The Kimsey Junior College building remained vacant until 1938 when Ducktown High School and Ducktown Elementary School relocated to the site. The High School remained in the building until 1956. The elementary school remained in the facility until 2006 when an agreement was reached to consolidate Ducktown and Turtletown Elementary Schools. Although the site was more centrally located for consolidation, concerns over ownership and maintenance costs led to the decision to choose another site. The new location chosen was the old Copper Basin High School building thus the Kimsey Junior College building was vacated. In September 1992, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 2007, the site has remained vacant although there has been interest expressed in the building for use as a community center, office space, and an assisted living facility. The building is still owned and maintained by the Fourth Fractional Township, one of the last remaining entities of its kind in the state. The township consists of a three-person board which provides security for the site and maintenance of the 150 acre tract the building occupies. Kimsey Junior College is noted for the construction materials as well as its architecture. Designed by architect Reuben H. Hunt as a Collegiate Gothic style building, Kimsey Junior College is the only structure designed by an architect in the Copper Basin. The inside of the building also shows the expense used in its construction and contains a large auditorium and gymnasium. The site is beginning to show signs of disrepair due to its age and vacancy. The parking lot in front of the building is becoming overgrown, several windows and doors are damaged, and remnants of the elementary school are still inside the building. In 2008, the building was placed on Tennessee‚Äôs list of most endangered historic sites on the national register by the Tennessee Preservation Trust. In 2009, grant funds from the National Park Service were used to make repairs to the roof and walls of the structure; however work is still required to complete roof repairs. The site is now blocked off to the public until it is proven safe enough for entrance, it is still unknown as to what this building will be in the future.

It is designed to help the United Nations and governments of disaster-affected countries during the first phase of a sudden-onset emergency. UNDAC also assists in the coordination of incoming international relief at national level and/or at the site of the emergency. UNDAC was created in 1993 and currently is composed by 259 national experts in emergency situations, as well as by OCHA personnel and regional and international organizations, including UN agencies. The UNDAC system comprises four components: # Staff: Experienced emergency managers made available for UNDAC missions by their respective governments or organizations. UNDAC members are specially trained and equipped for their task. # Methodology: Pre-defined methods for establishing coordination structures, and for organizing and facilitating assessments and information management during the first phase of a sudden-onset disaster or emergency. # Procedures: Proven systems to mobilize and deploy an UNDAC team to arrive at the disaster or emergency site within 12‚Äì48 hours of the request. # Equipment: Personal and mission equipment for UNDAC teams to be self- sufficient in the field when deployed for disasters/emergencies The UNDAC system has three regional teams: Europe/ Africa/ Middle East, the Americas (including the Caribbean) and Asia-Pacific. UNDAC teams can deploy at short notice (12‚Äì48 hours) anywhere in the world. They are provided free of charge to the disaster-affected country, and deployed upon the request of the United Nations Resident or Humanitarian Coordinator and/or the affected Government. Assessment, coordination and information management are UNDAC's core mandates in an emergency response mission. Specifically in response to earthquakes, UNDAC teams set up and manage the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC) to help coordinate international Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams responding to the disaster - essential if USAR assistance is to function effectively. This concept was strongly endorsed in United Nations General Assembly resolution 57/150 of 16 December 2002, on ‚ÄúStrengthening the effectiveness and coordination of international urban search and rescue assistance‚Äù.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster and Morecambe, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. History The church was partially built between 1898 and 1900 to a design by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. At this time the chancel, five bays of the nave, and the north aisle were constructed at a cost of ¬£4,214 (). In 1904 a font was installed, and in 1913 the south aisle and an organ chamber were added. A parish hall was built across the west end in 1961. =Present day= The worship at St Barnabas is in the catholic tradition of the Church of England. The parish priest is Fr Michael Childs, who was instituted and inducted as Vicar of the parish in September 2018. Architecture St Barnabas' Church is designed in \\"free Perpendicular\\" style, and is described as being \\"low and solid\\". It has aisles that run through to the east end. Inside, the nave has three-bay arcades carried on alternating round and octagonal piers. Between the nave and the chancel is a low wall that incorporates the pulpit. The stained glass dates between the 1970s and 1989, other than glass from the late 19th century that was re-set in 1989. The three manual organ was made by Wadsworth and Brother.

A 3rd party library, FMX Linux, enables the building of FireMonkey applications on Linux.  History FireMonkey is based on VGScene, which was designed by Eugene Kryukov of KSDev from Ulan-Ude, Russia as a next generation vector-based GUI. In 2011, VGScene was sold to the American company Embarcadero Technologies. Kryukov continued to be involved in the development of FireMonkey. Along with the traditional Windows only Visual Component Library (VCL), the cross-platform FireMonkey framework is included as part of Delphi, C++Builder and RAD Studio since version XE2. FireMonkey started out as a vector based UI framework, but evolved to be a bitmap or raster based UI framework to give greater control of the look to match target platform appearances. Overview FireMonkey is a cross-platform UI framework, and allows developers to create user interfaces that run on Windows, macOS, iOS and Android. It is written to use the GPU where possible, and applications take advantage of the hardware acceleration features available in Direct2D on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10, OpenGL on macOS, OpenGL ES on iOS and Android, and on Windows platforms where Direct2D is not available (Windows XP for example) it falls back to GDI+. Applications and interfaces developed with FireMonkey are separated into two categories, HD and 3D. An HD application is a traditional two-dimensional interface; that is, UI elements on the screen. It is referred to as HD because FireMonkey utilizes multi- resolution bitmaps in its dynamic style system to take advantage of high-DPI displays. The second type, a 3D interface, provides a 3D scene environment useful for developing visualisations. The two can be freely mixed, with 2D elements (normal UI controls such as buttons) in a 3D scene, either as an overlay or in the 3D space, and 3D scenes integrated into the normal 2D \\"HD\\" interface. The framework has inbuilt support for effects (such as blurs and glows, as well as others) and animation, allowing modern WPF-style fluid interfaces to be easily built. It also supports native themes, so that a FireMonkey application can look very close to native on each platform. Native controls can be used on Windows, macOS, iOS and Android through both third- party libraries and the ControlType property. FireMonkey is not only a visual framework but a full software development framework, and retains many features available with VCL. The major differences are: * Cross-platform compatibility * Any visual component can be a child of any other visual component, allowing for creation of hybrid components * Built-in styling support (now also available in VCL) * Use of Single precision floating point numbers for position, etc. instead of integers. * Support for GPU shader based visual effects (such as Glow, Inner Glow, Blur for example) and animation of visual components Due to the framework being cross-platform compatible, the same source code and form design can be used to deploy to the various platforms it supports. It natively supports 32-bit and 64-bit executables on Windows, 32-bit executables on macOS, 32-bit and 64-bit executables on iOS, and 32-bit and 64-bit executables on Android. FireMonkey includes platform services that adapt the user interface to the correct behavior and appearance on each target platform. Since its introduction in XE2, there have been numerous improvements in many areas of the framework and it is being actively developed and improved. For example, macOS development is integrated tightly into the IDE, requiring a Mac only for deployment. Numerous components such as sensors, touch and GPS have been added, especially useful for those developing mobile apps. There have been significant performance and underlying tech improvements, too. Features =Graphics= FireMonkey uses hardware acceleration when available on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Direct2D or OpenGL can be used on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. On Windows platforms where Direct2D is not available (Windows XP for example) it falls back to GDI+. OpenGL is used on macOS. OpenGL ES is used on iOS and Android. =Styles= All controls in FireMonkey are styleable via the styling system. This is accomplished by attaching a TStyleBook to the form, and a style is loaded and applied to the form. =Platform Services= In addition to visual components, FireMonkey provides a loosely coupled way of accessing platform specific features independent of the platform. This also shows up as platform default behaviors. For example the TabPosition of the TTabControl has a property value of PlatformDefault that moves the tabs to the top on Android and the bottom on iOS automatically to be in line with the design guidelines for those platforms.

The station and square were demolished in 1950, replaced with the Franklin Square Bridge, part of the Manhattan access to the Brooklyn Bridge. At the same time, the block of Cherry Street nearest the square was razed and replaced with the Alfred E. Smith Houses. The square was originally land owned by Walter Franklin, a highly successful late 18th century merchant,Franklin's daughter Maria married DeWitt Clinton. He was also the uncle of Judge Walter Franklin and the great-uncle of Walter S. Franklin. where he kept a mansion with surrounding gardens.

Some architectural scholars believe it to have originated along the coast of the Carolinas, hence the colloquial name. The defining characteristic of the rain porch is a roof that extends far beyond the edge of the porch deck and is supported with freestanding supports that rise directly from ground level, rather than the floor of the porch deck. This protects the porch deck from exposure to the elements and also leaves it well shaded from the sun most of the time. Most commonly seen on historic folk houses, the rain porch also came to be adapted to the monumental porticoes of some Greek Revival mansions, such as Rosemount and Kirkwood. The overhang became especially exaggerated in some areas with copious amounts of rainfall, such as the Eastern Shore of Mobile Bay in Alabama. Here the roof overhang ranged between beyond the porch deck, in effect creating a lower and upper porch.

Fixate on the \\"x\\" and attempt to identify the central (or single) letter appearing to the right. The presence of flankers should make the task more difficult. Crowding is a perceptual phenomenon where the recognition of objects presented away from the fovea is impaired by the presence of other neighbouring objects (sometimes called \\"flankers\\"). It has been suggested that crowding occurs due to mandatory integration of the crowded objects by a texture-processing neural mechanism, but there are several competing theories about the underlying mechanisms. It is considered a kind of grouping since it is \\"a form of integration over space as target features are spuriously combined with flanker features.\\" Crowding has long been thought to be predominantly a characteristic of peripheral vision. Yet, while it is indeed particularly prominent there, it is present in the whole of the visual field, with only its spatial extent varying (governed by Bouma‚Äôs law; see below). In particular, crowding is of utmost importance in foveal vision,Foveal vision refers to the situation where the observer fixates a visual object and, depending on the latter, uses anything between the tiny region of highest acuity (in acuity measurements) or the whole of the fovea and more (in reading) for processing the visual input. overriding the importance of visual acuity in pattern recognition and reading where crowding represents the bottleneck in processing. Crowding is prominently present in amblyopia and has been first mentioned in that context and studied quantitatively there. Crowding deficits have further been found in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism and may have clinical implications in these disorders. It also suggested that head injuries can cause a crowding effect. Normally sighted children up to the age of about eight years further have more pronounced crowding than adults, and this may be the reason for larger print in childrens books. Bouma‚Äôs law  The extent of crowding is mostly independent of a letter‚Äôs or form‚Äôs size, unlike what is the case in acuity. Instead, it depends very systematically on the distance to its neighbors. If the latter is above a critical value, crowding vanishes. In 1970, Herman Bouma has described a rule-of-thumb for that critical distance, stating that it amounts to about half the eccentricity value under which the crowded letter is seen (eccentricity measured as visual angle away from the fovea‚Äôs center). If, e.g., a letter is shown at 2.5 deg away from the fovea center ‚Äì which is approximately at the border of the fovea ‚Äì the critical distance amounts to 1.25 deg visual angle.For illustration: The thumb, held at arm‚Äôs length, subtends about 2.5 deg visual angle. Two adjacent thumbs at arm‚Äôs length thus correspond roughly to the size of the fovea. In a group of people that might be the size of another person‚Äôs head When the flankers are closer, crowding will thus occur. Newer research suggests that the factor in Bouma‚Äôs rule (originally ¬Ω) can vary quite a bit, and might often be a little smaller (e.g., 0.4). Furthermore, a small constant should be added in the equation, and there are further caveats. Overall, however, Bouma‚Äôs rule has since proven valid over a large variety of perceptual tasks. For its robustness, it is now often considered a perceptual law, similar to other perceptual laws (like Weber‚Äôs law, Ricc√≤'s law, Bloch's law).  History  Crowding, as we know today, is ‚Äì except in a few special circumstances ‚Äì the essential bottleneck for human pattern recognition and be demonstrated is the easiest of ways. It is thus striking that it has been overlooked over the centuries; the cause for degraded pattern recognition has mostly been, and still is, incorrectly ascribed to degraded visual acuity. The percepts in peripheral vision have already been described by Ibn al-Haytham in the 11th century as \\"confused and obscure\\". Later, James Jurin in 1738 described the phenomenon of \\"indistinct vision\\" which, in two examples, could be seen as the result of crowding. In the 19th century, the ophthalmologists Hermann Aubert and Richard F√∂rster in Breslau/Poland described the percept of two neighboring points in indirect vision as ‚Äúquite strangely undefined [\\"ganz eigenth√ºmlich unbestimmt\\"] as something black, the form of which cannot be further specified‚Äù. Note that, in none of these examples, the description is as \\"blurred\\" or \\"distorted\\", as is often (and misleadingly) seen in today‚Äôs characterizations. Crowding itself, however, i.e. the difference between singular letters and groups thereof, went unnoticed up to the 20th century. In 1924, then, the Gestalt psychologist Wilhelm Korte was the first to describe, in detail, percepts and phenomena of form perception in indirect vision. Probably around that time, crowding has become an issue in optometry and ophthalmology when testing amblyopic subjects with eye charts, as is apparent from a remark of the Danish ophthalmologist Holger Ehlers in 1936. James A. Stuart und Hermann M. Burian in Iowa were, in 1962, the first to study crowding systematically, for amblyopic subjects. In foveal vision, the related phenomenon of contour interaction was described (Merton Flom, Frank Weymouth & Daniel Kahneman, 1963). Herman Bouma, in 1970, famously found what was later called Bouma‚Äôs law, yet that paper was fully neglected for many years. In the coming three decades, the phenomenon was studied in experimental psychology, under different terms. Only then, the subject of Crowding found increasingly wide attention in visual perception research (Levi et al. 1985; Strasburger et al, 1991; Toet & Levi, 1992, Pelli et al., 2004). Fig. 19 in: . Today, it is a major topic in vision and perception and is increasingly recognized for being the major limitation of foveal and peripheral form perception.

Solar fuels can be produced through photochemical, photobiological (i.e., artificial photosynthesis), thermochemical (i.e., through the use of solar heat supplied by concentrated solar thermal energy to drive a chemical reaction), and electrochemical reactions.Solar Fuels and Artificial Photosynthesis, Nobel Laureate Professor Alan Heeger, RSC 2012 Light is used as an energy source, with solar energy being transduced to chemical energy, typically by reducing protons to hydrogen, or carbon dioxide to organic compounds. A solar fuel can be produced and stored for later use, when sunlight is not available, making it an alternative to fossil fuels. Diverse photocatalysts are being developed to carry these reactions in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.  Overview  The world's dependence on the declining reserves of fossil fuels poses not only environmental problems but also geopolitical ones. Solar fuels, in particular hydrogen, are viewed as an alternative source of energy for replacing fossil fuels especially where storage is essential. Electricity can be produced directly from sunlight through photovoltaics, but this form of energy is rather inefficient to store compared to hydrogen. A solar fuel can be produced when and where sunlight is available, and stored and transported for later usage. The most widely researched solar fuels are hydrogen and products of photochemical carbon dioxide reduction. Solar fuels can be produced via direct or indirect processes. Direct processes harness the energy in sunlight to produce a fuel without intermediary energy conversions. In contrast, indirect processes have solar energy converted to another form of energy first (such as biomass or electricity) that can then be used to produce a fuel. Indirect processes have been easier to implement but have the disadvantage of being less efficient than, e.g., water splitting for the production of hydrogen, since energy is wasted in the intermediary conversion.  Hydrogen production  = Photochemical = A sample of a photoelectric cell in a lab environment. Catalysts are added to the cell, which is submerged in water and illuminated by simulated sunlight. The bubbles seen are oxygen (forming on the front of the cell) and hydrogen (forming on the back of the cell). In a solar photochemical process, hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis. To use sunlight in this process, a photoelectrochemical cell can be used, where one photosensitized electrode converts light into an electric current that is then used for water splitting. One such type of cell is the dye-sensitized solar cell. This is an indirect process, since it produces electricity that then is used to form hydrogen. The other major indirect process using sunlight is conversion of biomass to biofuel using photosynthetic organisms; however, most of the energy harvested by photosynthesis is used in life-sustaining processes and therefore lost for energy use. A direct process can use a catalyst that reduces protons to molecular hydrogen upon electrons from an excited photosensitizer. Several such catalysts have been developed as proof of concept, but not yet scaled up for commercial use; nevertheless, their relative simplicity gives the advantage of potential lower cost and increased energy conversion efficiency. One such proof of concept is the \\"artificial leaf\\" developed by Nocera and coworkers: a combination of metal oxide-based catalysts and a semiconductor solar cell produces hydrogen upon illumination, with oxygen as the only byproduct. Hydrogen can also be produced from some photosynthetic microorganisms (microalgae and cyanobacteria) using photobioreactors. Some of these organisms produce hydrogen upon switching culture conditions; for example, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produces hydrogen anaerobically under sulfur deprivation, that is, when cells are moved from one growth medium to another that does not contain sulfur, and are grown without access to atmospheric oxygen. Another approach was to abolish activity of the hydrogen- oxidizing (uptake) hydrogenase enzyme in the diazotrophic cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme, so that it would not consume hydrogen that is naturally produced by the nitrogenase enzyme in nitrogen-fixing conditions. This N. punctiforme mutant could then produce hydrogen when illuminated with visible light. = Thermochemical = In the solar thermochemical process, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using direct solar heat, rather than electricity, inside a high temperature solar reactor which receives highly concentrated solar flux from a solar field of heliostats that focus the highly concentrated sunlight into the reactor. In a process that typically uses cerium oxide as the reactant, the first step is to strip the CeO2 into CeO at more than 1400 ¬∞C. After the thermal reduction step to reduce the metal oxide, hydrogen is then produced through hydrolysis at around 800 ¬∞C. Because hydrogen manufacture requires continuous performance, the solar thermochemical process includes thermal energy storage. Another thermochemical method uses solar reforming of methane, a process that replicates traditional fossil fuel reforming process but substitutes solar heat.  Carbon dioxide reduction  Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be reduced to carbon monoxide (CO) and other more reduced compounds, such as methane, using the appropriate photocatalysts. One early example was the use of Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride (Ru(bipy)3Cl2) and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) for CO2 reduction to CO. Many compounds that do similar reactions have since been developed, but they generally perform poorly with atmospheric concentrations of CO2, requiring further concentration. The simplest product from CO2 reduction is carbon monoxide (CO), but for fuel development, further reduction is needed, and a key step also needing further development is the transfer of hydride anions to CO. Also in this case, the use of microorganisms has been explored. Using genetic engineering and synthetic biology techniques, parts of or whole biofuel-producing metabolic pathways can be introduced in photosynthetic organisms. One example is the production of 1-butanol in Synechococcus elongatus using enzymes from Clostridium acetobutylicum, Escherichia coli and Treponema denticola. One example of a large-scale research facility exploring this type of biofuel production is the AlgaePARC in the Wageningen University and Research Centre, Netherlands.

Life and career Born in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw), Sandberg was the son of Dr. Richard and Tranzlska (n√©e Rosenthal) Sandberg. He was educated in Germany where he was a pupil of Julius Pr√ºwer in Breslau and Leo Blech in Berlin. He later married Blech's daughter, Lisel Blech, on 19 August 1939. Sandberg began his career as a r√©p√©titeur at the Breslau Opera in 1919 when he was only 17 years old; a position he remained in through 1922. He then became the kapellmeister and assistant conductor to Blech at the Theater des Westens in Berlin (also known as the Berlin Volksoper) in 1923. This was followed by a post at the Deutsche Oper Berlin as assistant to Bruno Walter. He then became a conductor at the Royal Swedish Opera (RSO) in Stockholm in 1926 where he remained for the rest of his career. He notably conducted several world premieres at the RSO, including Lars-Erik Larsson's Prinsessan av Cypern (1937),Vill man morda Lars-Erik Larssons mya opera? Stockholms Tidningen, 26 April 1937. Hilding Rosenberg's Lycksalighetens √∂ (1945), Natanael Berg's Genoveva (1947), and Ture Rangstr√∂m's Gilgamesj (1952). In 1950 he conducted the world premiere of Birgit Cullberg's ballet Medea to music by B√©la Bart√≥k at the Riksteatern G√§vle, a work he also conducted for its American premiere with the New York City Ballet at Lincoln Center in 1958. He was a guest conductor on several occasions at the Bavarian State Opera, the Hamburg State Opera, and the Semperoper among other houses, and with the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk in Hamburg and the RIAS Symphony Orchestra in Berlin. Sandberg's recordings as a conductor include a 1955 recording of Edvard Grieg‚Äôs Holberg Suite with the RIAS Symphony Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon and a 1956 recording of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns's Samson et Dalila with Set Svanholm (Samson), Blanche Thebom (Dalila), and the RSO Orchestra. As a composer he wrote a few orchestral pieces, some lieder, and the scores to four Swedish films: Blod och eld (1945), Det vackraste p√• jorden (1947), Giftas (1955), and Ett dockhem (1956). He is perhaps best remembered for translating several major German operas into the Swedish language; some of which are still used by the RSO and other opera houses in Sweden. Sandberg died in Danderyd, aged 63. Eva Sandberg is his sister.

Contributions by Rob Zimmelman, an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Albany, from 1981 to 1984 on the Univac 1100 mainframe, included the inclusion of the CATPAC software in the Galileo*Telegal system, text-labeling and porting of CATPAC output for the Galileo system of paired-comparison conceptual visualization. CATPAC and the Galileo system are still in commercial use today, and with recent data capture and visualization contributions, continues to grow. Contributions by other students at the university resulted in the software that is still in commercial use today. It uses text files as input and produces output such as word and alphabetical frequencies as well as various types of cluster analysis. Design Catpac is a self-organizing, i.e. unsupervised, interactive activation and competition (IAC) artificial neural network used for text analysis. http://www.galileoco.com/literature/Wolfpak10a.pdf The program generates a multidimensional scalar output organizing words throughout the text by creating a weighted word-by-word matrix that establishes the eigenvector centralities of concepts. The word-by-word matrix represents the relationship between one word and the occurrence of another. Catpac identifies important words and patterns based on the organization of the text. This process mimics the connections between neurons in a human brain, strengthening connections through conditioning to generate a pattern of similarities among all words within a body of text. Use Catpac has been used in commercial studies, in academic scholarship to investigate massive textual data sets, as a strong semantic network analysis tool, for longitudinal analyses, for multilingual analyses, as a predictor of media usage and as a powerful content analysis tool.

A CTA most often refers to the use of words or phrases that can be incorporated into sales scripts, advertising messages, or web pages, which compel an audience to act in a specific way. Definition In marketing, a call to action (CTA) is an instruction to the audience designed to provoke an immediate response, usually using an imperative verb such as \\"call now\\", \\"find out more\\" or \\"visit a store today\\".Eisenberg, B., CALL TO ACTION: Secret Formulas to Improve Online Results, Nashville, Tennessee, Thomas Nelson, 2006, p. 20 Other types of calls to action might provide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately such an offer that is only available for a limited time (e.g. 'Offer must expire soon'; 'Limited stocks available') or a special deal usually accompanied by a time constraint (e.g. 'Order before midnight to receive a free gift with your order'; 'Two for the price of one for first 50 callers only'). The key to a powerful call to action is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions. A CTA can be a simple non-demanding request like \\"choose a colour\\" or \\"watch this video\\", or a much more demanding request. An obvious CTA would be a request for the consumer to purchase a product or provide personal details and contact information. Applications Many marketing materials such as brochures, flyers, catalogs, email campaigns, also make use of a call to action. Such instructions are designed to show consumers how to take the next step and create a sense of urgency around the offer.Horner, T., \\"Writing a Better Call to Action,\\" Marketing Professors, Example of a website CTA Successful sales representatives have long recognised that specific words and phrases elicit desirable responses from prospects and soon learn to incorporate the best lines into effective sales scripts. Clever sales pitches often incorporate a series of small CTAs that lead to a final CTA. These smaller CTAs create a pattern of behaviour that makes it easier for the audience to follow-through with just one last CTA, completing a more demanding request, than had it been asked without context. An example could be the purchase of a designer timepiece. The sales person might ask the consumer to choose a style, then a colour, a size and even a personalised engraving.Niblick, J., The Profitable Consultant: Starting, Growing, and Selling Your Expertise, Wiley, 2013, When the client views the personalised design, they are more likely to be predisposed to complete the purchase. The sales representative can close the sale by asking, \\"Will that be cash or credit, today?\\" Advertising messages, especially direct-response advertising messages, often make extensive use of calls to action. The key to a powerful call to action is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions. An article in the Wall Street Journal suggests that the incidence of calls to action in television advertisements is increasing due to marketers' desire for instant and measurable results.Steinberg, B., \\"'Call to Action' Ads Give Clients Results They Can Measure,\\" Wall Street Journal, 22 March 2005, In web design, a CTA may be a banner, button, or some graphic or text on a website meant to prompt a user to click it, and continue down a conversion funnel. It is an essential part of inbound marketing as well as permission marketing in that it actively strives to convert a user into a lead and later into a customer. The main goal of a CTA is a click, or a scan in the case of a QR code, and its success can be measured with a click-through rate, a conversion rate formula that calculates the number of clicks over the times the CTA was seen.Liflander, R., The Everything Online Business Book: Use the Internet to Build Your Business, Holbrook, MA, Adams Media, 2000, p. 25 Another way to test the effectiveness of a CTA is using A/B testing where several graphics are presented to users and the graphic with highest success rate becomes the default.Bashinsky, A., \\"6 Easy Ways to Incorporate Emotional Appeals Into Your Website's Call to Actions,\\" Entrepreneur, 13 January 2016, See also * Advertising management * Consumer behaviour * Personal selling  References  Category:Promotion and marketing communications Category:Digital marketing Category:Internet terminology Category:User interface techniques ","title":"Call to action (marketing)"},{"id":"34504657","text":"Kulotino () is an urban locality (a work settlement) in Okulovsky District of Novgorod Oblast, Russia,Law #559-OZ located on the Peretna River a few kilometers northeast of the town of Okulovka.

In the end of 1927, Polishchsky Selsoviet was renamed Kulotinsky Selsoviet, and on June 25, 1928, Kulotino was granted urban-type settlement status. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On July 5, 1944, Okulovsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since. Economy =Industry= Kulotino was founded as a settlement around the textile factory. The factory was defunct as of 2011. =Transportation= Kulotino is a railway station on the line connecting Okulovka and Nebolchi. As of 2011, there was one suburban train per day calling at Kulotino. The settlement is also connected by road with Okulovka. Culture and recreation In Kulotino, there are four cultural heritage monuments of local significance. Two of them are archaeological sites, and two are the graves of the soldiers fallen in World War II.

It is a novel conserved DNA-binding domain is found at the N-terminus of the poxvirus D6R/NIR proteins. It is also found in a wide range of proteins of large bacterial and eukaryotic DNA viruses. Putative proteins with homology to the KilA-N domain have also been identified in Maverick transposable elements of the parabasalid protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis. The KilA-N domain has been suggested to be homologous to the fungal DNA-binding APSES domain. In all proteins shown to contain the KilA-N domain, it occurs at the extreme amino terminus accompanied by a wide range of distinct carboxy-terminal domains. These carboxy-terminal modules may be enzymes, such as the nuclease domains, or might mediate additional, specific interactions with nucleic acids or proteins, like the RING or CCCH fingers in the poxviruses. The KilA-N domain is predicted to adopt an alpha-beta fold with four conserved strands and at least two conserved helices.

Digital information can be associated with objects and places, and the associated information can be retrieved by using ucode. Unique identification system for real world objects is considered an essential enabler for the realisation of Internet of Things and therefore ucode system is seen as a building block for Internet of Things. The ucode system uses 128 bit code for unique naming of things so there are 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 or 3.4 x 10^38 different codes. If more codes are needed, they can be added in chunks of 128 bits. Ucode is application and technology agnostic. Uniqueness means that each ucode is unique, there can ‚Äì or at least should - not be another ucode with exactly same number. Ucode is not tied to any specific application or business domain, neither is it committed to any specific technology for containing the ucode number, e.g. RFID, barcode or matrix code. ucode is supported by the uID center, which is a non-profit organisation based in Tokyo, Japan. The Chairman of the uID Center is Professor Ken Sakamura who is also the person behind ucode. Structure and Resolution mechanism Ubiquitous ID system consists of five components: (1) ucode, (2) ucode tag, (3) ubiquitous communicator, (4) ucode resolution server and (5) ucode information server. The resolution process goes as follows. First, the ucode from an ucode tag using e.g. a mobile phone is read. The camera of the phone can be used to read a matrix code containing the ucode. Then, the mobile phone inquires the ucode resolution server ‚Äì via internet connection - about the code. The ucode resolution server returns the source of the provided ucode information based on the ucode read. Finally, the ubiquitous communicator connects to the information provision source and acquires contents and services. The ucode server architecture is similar to the familiar Internet DNS resolution service. Like DNS, the ucode resolution mechanism consists of hierarchical levels. The ucode resolution mechanism is three tiered as follows: *uID center maintains the root server *Top level domain (TLD) servers are under root *Second level domain (SLD) servers are under TLD The root server is maintained by uID Center in Tokyo. TLD servers are in place in Japan, other Asian countries and in Europe (Oulu, Finland). The number of TLD and SLD servers is not limited.  ucode tags  Ucode tags can take various forms. They can be *Print Tag *Passive RFID Tag/Smart Card *Active RF Tag (built-in battery type) *Active Infrared Tag (built-in battery type) *Acoustic Tag Print tags can be matrix codes, e.g. QR codes or barcodes. A special sub-section of RFID tags are NFC tags, which can contain ucode. UID Center has certified a 46 differenrf ucode tags, the first ones in 2003 were barcodes made by Sato corporation, Toppan Forms Inc. and Dai Nippon Printing Co., later on two dimensional matrix codes were introduced, followed by hologram implementation and several RFID tags, often compliant with ISO/IEC15693 standard and using frequency band 13.56 MHz.  Example  The ucode solution has been used in a number of trial cases related to tourist guides, geospatial information applications, housing and real estate as well as food and drug traceability. Japanese organisation Center for Better Living is using ucode for labelling construction material and components in a unique and traceable manner. The label is a sign of approved quality and entitles the buyer into a two to ten year repair warranty, depending on the nature of the material or component. Other identification systems EPCGlobal is an identification system aimed for supply chain information management. The EPC (Electronic Product Code) relies on RFID tags for object identification. EPCGlobal is a successor of MIT Auto ID Center which developed the technology used by EPCGlobal. [EAN] International Article Numbering system and its sister system UPC Universal Product Code are the familiar barcodes seen in all retail merchandise. ucode differs from them in identifying individual objects, not just the product type.

Development Flemish artists such as Frans Snyders and Adriaen van Utrecht started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals. The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven A leading Dutch representative was Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.Jan Davidsz. de Heem at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Ben van Beneden, Massijs, Rubens, Van Dyck en de anderen. Schilderkunst in Antwerpen, 1500-1650 Other leading representatives in Flanders and the Dutch Republic were Nicolaes van Verendael, Alexander Coosemans, Carstian Luyckx, Jasper Geeraards, Peter Willebeeck, Abraham van Beyeren and Willem Kalf. Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts developed the style further by incorporating pronkstillevens in the trompe-l'≈ìil compositions for which he was known. An example is his Silverware in an Open Cabinet at the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent.Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, Pronkstilleven in an open cabinet at barokinvlaanderen Meaning Silverware in an Open Cabinet by Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts Pronkstillevens are usually interpreted as a form of vanitas painting that conveys a moral lesson. The various objects in the compositions serve as symbols that can be read as an admonition or a life lesson. The objects usually refer to the transience and emptiness of wealth and possessions and the ultimate extinction and emptiness of earthly life. For instance, roses are often used as a vanitas motif, as they recall that all life and earthly beauty are fleeting. Hourglasses are an admonition that life is fleeting and will end. Empty containers such as glasses or vases point to the emptiness of earthly wealth and aspirations. The paintings remind the viewer of the need to practice moderation and temperance.L.J., Bol, Abraham van Beyeren - Pronk-stilleven at okv References Category:Flemish art Category:Dutch painting Category:Baroque painting Category:Visual arts genres Category:Still life painters Category:Art of the Dutch Golden Age ","title":"Pronkstilleven"},{"id":"34504824","text":"Sebasti√°n Rodrigo Gait√°n Ara√∫jo (born June 21, 1987 in Montevideo) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder.

He retired from the Foreign Service in 1962, but was a State Department negotiator on the Panama Canal treaty the next year.Obituary, New York Times, Nov. 20, 1991 While Ambassador to Haiti in 1961, Newbegin was recalled to Washington prior to the inauguration of dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier, in protest of his fraudulent election. A Marine colonel stationed in Haiti once referred to Newbegin as an \\"extremely decisive and strong-willed Ambassador\\", a judgement echoed in other sources. In a state department briefing during the recall, however, Newbegin expressed the opinion that there was no credible opposition in Haiti to Duvalier, and thus that the recall would have little positive effect. Newbegin was right, in that the US cut off economic assistance in 1962 and Duvalier appointed himself President for Life in 1964. While ambassador, Newbegin instituted a French-language training programme among US government personnel there, and urged Americans to step up their contributions to Haitian charities.Charles T.

Colonel Benjamin Berringer built the house in 1658. This house is one of only three genuine Jacobean mansions in the Western Hemisphere. It's similar to the English Jacobean-era manor houses of the first half of the seventeenth century, the period between the Tudor and Georgian styles, beginning in the reign of James I.  History  Dining Room at St Nicholas Abbey St Nicholas Abbey has no church connection, it has always been a sugarcane plantation house. The exact origin of its name is not known but rumour has it that it was named after George Nicholas, husband to Berringer's granddaughter, Susanna. Berringer was killed in a duel with his neighbor, Sir John Yeamans, who then married Berringer's widow and claimed the abbey as his property. In 1669, the Colonel's children took the matter to court and were awarded ownership of the property. Sir John and his wife then moved to British America, where they helped found South Carolina. The house was later acquired by the eminent baronet, planter and legislator, Sir John Gay Alleyne, through his marriage to Christian Dottin. He lived there from 1746 until his death in 1801. Alleyne family traditions hold that Sir John planted the impressive mahogany avenue leading to Cherry Tree Hill. The house passed by marriage to Charles Cave in 1834. The abbey was no longer a functioning plantation after 1947. Sugar has been grown on the plantation since 1640 and there is still the evidence of the mill and sugar making edifices. Sugar was processed on the property until 1947, the cane is now trucked eight miles to the Portvale Sugar Factory for processing. His great-great-grandson Lt. Col. Stephen Cave OBE lived there from 1978 until his death in November 2003. Since 2006, the abbey is owned by local Barbadian architect, Larry Warren. Warren built the St. Nicholas Abbey Heritage Railway on his estate, which was completed by the end of 2018.  Museum  St Nicholas Abbey is currently a well-preserved museum, successfully recreating 18th-century plantation life complete with; Wedgwood pottery, Chippendale furniture, curvilinear Dutch gables with tall finials of carved coral stone and corner chimneys. The entrance portico, Chinese Chippendale staircase and cedar panelling are later additions to the home. The fireplaces and walled Medieval herb garden were almost certainly included in the original plans brought from England, and copied faithfully. There is a rare 1930s film of life on a sugar plantation that is available for viewing in the museum. Listed by the Barbados Tourism Authority as one of the \\"Seven Wonders of Barbados,\\" the property has attracted several thousand visitors a year. Amongst the mahogany trees are box, cabbage palm, silk cotton, and avocado trees.  Literature  * St. Nicholas Abbey.

Life and career Russell Dumas was born in Brisbane, and studied both classical and modern dance. He first began stage performance with J.C. Williamson and later danced internationally with the London Festival Ballet, Ballet Rambert, Nederlands Dans Theater, the Royal Ballet, Culberg Ballet, Strider Dance Company, Trisha Brown and Twyla Tharp. In 1976 Dumas founded the Dance Exchange in Sydney with Nanette Hassall, Eva Karczag and David Hinkfuss. He continues to serve as artistic director. His choreography is often performed without lighting, costumes or music and is described as postmodern. In 1985 he founded the Dancelink program to give Australian artists access to seminal dance practices from the USA, Asia and Europe. Dumas is also known for critical analysis and writing. Brisbane-born Russell Dumas trained in a number of dance styles in Australia and overseas including classical ballet, and the Graham and Cunningham techniques. He began his performing career in musical comedy with the J.C Williamson organisation and later danced with a wide variety of English and European companies including the London Festival Ballet, Ballet Rambert, Nederlands Dans Theater, the Royal Ballet, Culberg Ballet, Strider and in the US with Trisha Brown and Twyla Tharp. In 1976 Dumas founded the Sydney-based company Dance Exchange with Nanette Hassall, which he continues to direct. In 1985 he established the Dancelink program, bringing many dance teachers and artists to Australia. His interests have encompassed not only choreography, performance and film but critical analysis and writing as well. [Text from Australian National Library.] Russell Dumas, one of Australia's most respected and influential choreographers Russell Dumas founded Dance Exchange in 1976. His choreography, presented under the company‚Äüs name ever since, constitutes one of the most distinctive and original bodies of Australian dance work. Dance Exchange represents, uniquely, the legacy of American modern and post-modern (as opposed to European contemporary) dance in Australia. Dumas's dance style has been described a \\"sensuous, non-decorative, pedestrian classicism‚Äü (Larousse Dictionnaire de la Danse 1999). With its deceptive simplicity, this aesthetic, present in all Dumas's choreographies, requires a prolonged and rigorous work with dancers. Each dance and each performance grows out of this work. The dancing, free of narrative, psychological or other theatrical overtones is a testament to kinaesthetic intelligence and an ode to the simple, always surprising, sometimes humorous beauty of human bodies-in-action. Awards include the Jury Prize for International Video Dance Festival, Sete, 1990 for Approaching Sleipner Junction. This is beautiful work‚ÄîDANCE FOR THE TIME BEING ‚Äì simple, yet complex; highly imaginative; profoundly physical; sensuous without being overtly erotic. You feel the choreography as a warm current of motion that the dancers are guiding through their bodies. The prevalent dynamic is deliberate, with occasional surprising little eruptions. (...)Moves like this may sound tricky (and they are), but the calm clarity with which they're performed make them look as unaffected as breathing, and every recovery from a manoeuvre is unhurried, smooth, and resilient. This makes an accent as small as the quick flip of someone's hand or a sudden run or the deliberate stamp of a foot against the floor seem startling.\\" The Village Voice Works Selected works include: *Surround (1993) *...and yet (1995) *The Oaks Caf√© (1997‚Äì2000) \\"touch and go\\", The Performance Space, Sydney (2001) \\"in the room\\" (2003‚Äì2009) *huit √† huit- (2009) history of works : DANCE FOR THE TIME BEING ‚Äì SOUTHERN EXPOSURE\\" (2013) Dance for the time being\\" (2010 -2012) In The Room 2004‚Äì2005, Cultural Residues 2003, In Available Light 2003, Touch and Go 2002, The Oaks Caf√©/Cuckoo 2000, Cassandra‚Äôs Dance 1999, Cargo Cult/Accumulation 1998, Cargo Cult 1997, Through Frames 1996‚Ä¶And Yet 1995, Envelope 1995, One Leg From Certain Angles 1994, A Tree From Any Direction 1994, Surround 1993, Duets Project 1993, Eurotrash 1992, Trailer 1991, Rescued Estates 1991, Approaching Sleipner Junction 1990, Local Motion ‚Äì Program 2 1990, Blue Palm/White Lies 1989, Occasional Dances 1989, Incidental Light 1989, Between Movement and Light 1989, Foreign Bodies/Local Solos 1988, Postmodern Cabaret 1987, Dancing Sara‚Äôs Phrases 1987, Small Appropriations 1986, Double Exposure 1985, Local Motion 1985, Circular Quay......‚Ä¶ 1984‚Äì85, Distinguishing Feature 1983, 8 ‚Äì 9 1982, Project 1982, One for Nothing 1982, Mulambin Beach 1981‚Äì1983, Interludes 1981, Circles 1981, 4,3,2,1- 1981, Rough Cuts 1981, Grid 1980, Beach I, II and III 1979, Blinky Bill 1979, Fractions and Fractions T.V.

He was a close friend to Alexander Hamilton, who was taken to his Greenwich Village home after his famous duel with Aaron Burr, where Hamilton later died. Life Bayard was born in 1761 to Catharine McEvers (1732‚Äì1814) and William Bayard Sr. (‚Äì1804), who was elected as a delegate to the 1765 Stamp Act Congress, and was assigned to the committee that drafted language opposing taxation without representation. When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, his father remained loyal to the crown, assisting the British troops that occupied New York City in 1776. Although Bayard Jr. remained in New York after the war, other members of the family had fled, and many of the family's properties were confiscated. His siblings included Samuel Vetch Bayard (1757‚Äì1832) and Mary Bayard (1779‚Äì1849). =Family= Bayard was a member of the prominent Bayard family of French Huguenot ancestry who descended from Balthazar Bayard, a French Protestant, who had taken refuge in the Dutch Republic where the Huguenots found sanctuary from their religious persecution in France. The first Bayards in the New World arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam with the newly appointed Governor-General Peter Stuyvesant. In the early 18th century, the Bayards became among the largest landowners in the New York-New Jersey area. Bayard was also a descendant of Stephanus Van Cortlandt and the Schuyler family. Career He founded the mercantile firm of LeRoy, Bayard & McEvers with Herman LeRoy and James McEvers.

Hamilton died in Bayard's home the next day. Personal life In 1783, Bayard married Elizabeth Cornell (d. 1854), daughter of Loyalist Samuel Cornell and Susannah Mabson, and a descendant of Thomas Cornell (ca. 1595‚Äìca. 1655). Elizabeth's father died in 1781 in British-controlled New York, having moved there from North Carolina after 1777 after refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance to the new United States. Samuel Cornell had transferred a share of his North Carolina property to Elizabeth; in 1779, however, the North Carolina Legislature voted to retroactively seize all property of Loyalists back to 1776. In November 1784, Mrs. Bayard unsuccessfully sued to have her property returned to her.Murphy, Elizabeth Burbank. Bayard, Elizabeth Cornell.

It exposes a very deep and normally hidden parautochthonous unit at the surface.  Geography and geology  Plagioclase-bearing paragneiss from Nontron Geological map of the Saint- Mathieu dome The Saint-Mathieu dome, named after the small town Saint-Mathieu in the Haute-Vienne department, is situated at the very northwestern edge of the Massif Central. To the southwest the dome structure is bordered by sediments of the Aquitaine Basin, the contact usually being marked by a border fault. On its eastern side the upwarp is overthrust by augengneisses (A) of the Lower Gneiss Unit (LGU), which between Saint-Jean-de-C√¥le in the South and the hamlet of Peyrassoulat (commune of Ch√©ronnac) in the North override the Parautochthonous Micaschist Unit (PMU). The dome is bounded to the North by paragneisses of the Lower Gneiss Unit. The northwestern corner of the basement high is cut off by the Le Lindois Fault separating the dome's interior from the Mazerolles Unit in the Northwest and from Lias to the Southwest. The dome measures about 35 kilometers in its maximal meridional extension and about 25 kilometers in an East-West direction. Within the dome the following geological units can be discerned: * Parautochthonous Micaschist Unit (PMU), bounded to the West by the intrusive Saint-Mathieu Leucogranite (SML) and to the North by the Ch√©ronnac Leucogranite. * Paragneisses (P), intruded by the Pi√©gut- Pluviers Granodiorite (PPG). On its western side the upwarp is traversed by a North-South-striking fault zone, which separates the Pi√©gut-Pluviers granodiorite from the paragneisses. This fault zone starts at Lacr√®te (commune of √âtouars) in the South and terminates just south of Massignac in the North.  Formation  Anatectic Roussines granite, part of the Saint-Mathieu leucogranite The interior of the dome structure is dominated by magmatic intrusive rocks, especially east of the North-South trending fault zone. These rocks occupy about 80% of the dome's surface area. It is therefore very likely that the basement upwarp was caused by a ballooning of the neovariscan intrusives. A direct tectonical cause of the structure caused by horsing thrust units during mediovariscan tectogenesis (continental collision 400 to 360 million years BP in the Limousin can be ruled out as the Saint-Mathieu leucogranite intruded well above the thrust plane and also sent many small apophyses into the augengneisses.  Age  The neovariscan intrusives within the dome were emplaced during the Pennsylvanian, the Pi√©gut-Pluviers granodiorite is dated for instance at 315 to 314 million years BP. The Saint- Mathieu leucogranite is younger, its coarse-grained facies was dated at 304 million years. This terminal Carboniferous age is most probably also the date for the final arching of the upwarp.  Regional overview  Mialet. These augengneisses overthrust the dome in the east. The Saint-Mathieu dome is situated to the west of a large synform in the variscan nappe stack, the Saint-Germain-les-Belles Synform. South of Limoges this medium to high grade nappe stack consists of the Parautochthonous Micaschist Unit at the bottom, tectonically overlain by the Lower Gneiss Unit and the Upper Gneiss Unit (UGU) resting on top. The Upper Gneiss Unit is itself overthrust by the less metamorphic Thiviers-Payzac Unit (TPU) from the south. The Mazerolles Unit (MU), also of lower metamorphic grade and lithologically comparable to the TPU, overrides the paragneisses of the Lower Gneiss Unit from the southwest. The Saint-Mathieu dome has upturned the nappe pile at its eastern edge so that the normally hidden Parautochthonous Micaschist Unit now appears at the surface. Similar structural relationships can be seen in the Millesvaches Massif east of the central synform. The Millesvaches Massif is also oriented North-South and consists like the Saint-Mathieu dome largely of intrusive rocks rimmed by micaschists of the PMU. With 160 kilometers it has a much larger meridional extension though. The 35 kilometers for the Saint-Mathieu dome most likely are only a minimal value as a possible extension of the dome underneath the sediments of the Aquitaine Basin has not been verified yet.

They debate whether to destroy the Earth or make humanity a member of the council. As a test, they will give one random human limitless power, the ability to do \\"absolutely anything\\". After ten days, if the powers were used for evil, Earth will be destroyed. The chosen human is Neil Clarke, a teacher struggling under Headmaster Robinson. Neil has a crush on his neighbor, Catherine West. Oblivious to his new power, Neil wishes for aliens to destroy the classroom of students hated by him, which indeed causes an alien spaceship to kill everyone in that classroom. Perplexed, Neil tests himself to find out that he can do anything. To fix the deaths of his students he wishes that \\"everyone who died come back to life\\", causing all dead people to rise as zombies; he reverses this and asks that the explosion never happened, which reverses all previous wishes. Next day he wishes for another teacher, Miss Pringle, to worship his friend Ray, who is too shy to tell Pringle that he likes her. Neil uses his power for petty personal gains and to give his dog Dennis the ability to speak. One night, the galactic power fails to make Catherine fall in love with Neil, but then coincidentally Catherine knocks at his door. They spend the night together and are seen by Catharine's stalker ex-boyfriend, Colonel Grant. Catherine hears Dennis shouting that he loves Neil, making her think that Neil has a gay boyfriend. Ray says that Miss Pringle doesn't love him romantically, instead she worships him as a god. Catherine locks Grant in her apartment. Neil breaks Grant's arm and then fixes it, revealing his ability to grant wishes whenever he says a wish and makes a hand gesture. Grant kidnaps Neil, tying his hand and gagging him to prevent his escape, and then forces him to grant some selfish or absurd wishes (such as giving all native English people huge ears and duck feet), threatening to shoot Dennis. Catherine and Ray rescue Neil who reverses all of the wishes, including Miss Pringle's now violently fanatical worship of Ray, who was close to being ritually killed by her and the cult she created. Catherine angrily tells Neil that she could never love anyone so controlling. Disheartened, Neil decides to use his powers to solve the world's problems; he grants everyone in the world as much food as they want, says that wars shouldn't happen for any reason, grants every person their own dream house and wishes for the reversion of global warming. However, this backfires when worldwide obesity flares, all land is taken over for houses, several countries declare war for no reason (as opposed to \\"any reason\\"), and the planet falls into a global ice age. Neil reverses all these wishes. Disheartened with his personal life and futile attempts to make the world a better place he attempts suicide, but as he jumps into the Thames, Dennis jumps in after him and Neil is forced to rescue the dog and by consequence himself. Afterward, Dennis says that Neil should give the power to him, as he never thinks of anything selfish. Neil does so. Meanwhile, the aliens decide that Earth is not worthy. It turns out that the galactic council has a different morality than humans - they see dominance as good, and weakness as evil, with Neil trying to end wars and make the life of others better being a sign of weakness. They decide to destroy Earth, but Dennis wishes that the source of power be destroyed, causing the doom weapon of the council to bounce back to the alien ship, killing them all. With no power left, but full of confidence, the next day Neil asks Catherine out, to which she agrees.

He described it as being about Neil, a teacher in a failing secondary school, who is given the ability to make anything happen by asking it to. He only realizes he has this after saying \\"I'd make an alien spaceship hit class 10C and vaporize them\\" to a colleague, only to hear an explosion elsewhere in the school and find 10C's classroom destroyed. Jones credited the film's idea to the H. G. Wells story \\"The Man Who Could Work Miracles\\", but said that it \\"just changed out of all recognition from that\\". He also explained that the script for the film has been around for 20 years, saying: \\"I just think it's my own baby really. But I wrote it with Gavin Scott, and we've been writing it for 20 years, then Mike Medavoy rang up in 2010 or so and asked what scripts I had hidden in my bottom desk drawer. So I pulled out Absolutely Everything ‚Äì not literally, of course ‚Äì and here we are.\\" He also spoke about the character Dennis the Dog, saying: \\"I think he's going to steal the show. We've got a real dog, Mojo, who is very obedient, and a wonderful dog, a mongrel, but CGI work will be done. Simon Pegg is a big dog fan, and him and Mojo get on very well. Before Douglas Adams died, he looked over the script and he said that Dennis the Dog's scenes were the funniest scenes...\\" He also spoke about the designs of the alien characters, saying: \\"James Acheson is doing the costumes, and he has already got a wonderful array of aliens of different sizes and shapes. The story behind the aliens is they intercept the Voyager space craft as it leaves the solar system [and] comes into intergalactic space ‚Äì well, it isn't really intergalactic space, but we pretend it is, anyway ‚Äì and they say they have to assess one Earthling at random by giving them these powers. They pick Neil.\\" =Casting= On 14 September 2010, the film was first announced, and it was also announced that John Oliver, Robin Williams, John Cleese, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam were cast in the film, with Eric Idle announced as joining his fellow Pythons on 20 February 2014.

On 19 March 2014, Rob Riggle was cast in the film. =Filming= Principal photography and production began on 24 March 2014, and ended on 12 May 2014. Director Jones said \\"It and it was shot in London. We took over a disused school in Hornsey Lane, which is not far from my house. We built the studios in there and used it as a base. Then, we shot the interiors of the flats in Earl‚Äôs Court.\\" On 28 March 2014, it was announced that Lionsgate UK would distribute the film in the United Kingdom. Music Australian singer Kylie Minogue recorded and released a promotional single, \\"Absolutely Anything and Anything At All\\", for the soundtrack.

Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 18% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. Its consensus states \\"Given the impressive array of talent involved in Absolutely Anything‚Äîand the near-total lack of laughs it provokes‚Äîthis Monty Python reunion can only be regarded as a disappointment\\". On Metacritic the film received a weighted average score of 31 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film 1/5 star, and said \\"cheap and cheerless sci-fi comedy. There‚Äôs a blue-chip cast here, and it‚Äôs directed by Terry Jones; the Pythons have cameos, as creepy alien creatures. But this low- budget Brit film is just depressing, a sub-Douglas Adams sci-fi comedy which looks like mediocre kids‚Äô TV with a dismal script and cheap‚Äôn‚Äôcheerless production values. A huge amount of talent here. Sadly it goes nowhere.\\" James Mottram of The List also awarded the film 1 star, and said \\"Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale head up an awful sci-fi comedy from Terry Jones. It‚Äôd be very sad if this is the last Python collaboration to hit screens.\\" Notes References External links  * * Category:2015 films Category:British films Category:British science fiction comedy films Category:English-language films Category:2010s science fiction comedy films Category:Films about dogs Category:Films using computer-generated imagery Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Monty Python Category:Lionsgate films Category:Icon Productions films Category:Films scored by George Fenton Category:Films directed by Terry Jones Category:Films with screenplays by Terry Jones Category:Films about wish fulfillment Category:Films about animals ","title":"Absolutely Anything"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(R,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/3.md","filePath":"glossary/3.md"}'),H={name:"glossary/3.md"},x=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{F as __pageData,x as default};
