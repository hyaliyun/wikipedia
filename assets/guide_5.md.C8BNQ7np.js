Vattisen Yaly could be categorised as a particular form of Tengrism, a related revivalist movement of Central Asian traditional religion. However, Vattisen Yaly differs significantly from other forms of Tengrism in that the Chuvash have been heavily influenced by Fenno-Ugric and Slavic cultures as well as those of other Indo-European ethnicitiesValentin Stetsyuk.

(they were also never fully Islamised, unlike most other Turkic peoples). The Chuvash are not simply Finns Tatarized in language, but show evidence in face form, nose form, and in the scarcity of true blondism, that the Turkish influence did bring some Mongolic traits. Their religion shows many similarities with Finnic and Slavic Paganisms; moreover, the revival of \\"Vattisen Yaly\\" in recent decades has occurred following Neopagan patterns.Sergei Filatov, Aleksandr Shchipkov. Religious Developments among the Volga Nations as a Model for the Russian Federation. Religion, State & Society, Vol. 23, No. 3, 1995. pp. 239-243 Today the followers of the Chuvash Traditional Religion are called \\"the true Chuvash\\". Their main god is Tura, a deity comparable to the Estonian Taara, the Germanic Thunraz and the pan- Turkic Tengri. The Chuvash traditional religion boasts an unbroken continuity from pre-Christian times, having been preserved in a few villages of the Chuvash diaspora outside Chuvashia until modern times.Vovina 2000, p. 2. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, together with the demise of the Soviet Union, a cultural and national revival blossomed among the Chuvash, and its leaders gradually embraced the idea of a return to indigenous Paganism, as did Chuvash intellectuals.Vovina 2000, pp. 3-5. The Chuvash identity movement looked to movements in the Baltic states for inspiration. The national movement, meanwhile embodied in a Chuvash National Congress, carried on its \\"national religion\\" idea during the 1990s. Intellectuals started to recover and codify ancient rituals and started practicing them among the population both in cities and countryside villages, declaring themselves the guardians of tradition and the descendants of elder priests.Vovina 2000, p. 7. Groups In the mid-1990s, the proponents of the movement felt that to fulfill the role of a \\"national religion\\" and stand against world religions and cultural assimilation, Vattisen Yaly should be reconstructed and reformulated in institutional forms.Vovina 2000, p. 8. A variety of groups emerged dedicated to the goal of reviving the Chuvash religion. A lot of publications on the religion appeared, and artists and sculptors joined academic scholars in the creation of models for the construction of ritual-ceremonial complexes. Periodic prayers were introduced in public life by one of the groups, and it gave the religion the name of Sardash, which apparently comes from the Chuvash word sara, meaning \\"yellow\\". In Chuvash culture Sar, Sarat is an epithet of the Sun. Arguments emerged among the groups and factions over matters such as theology and national organisation of the religions. For instance, Iosif Dimitriev (Trer), an artist and enthusiastic follower of the religion and member of the \\"Chuvash National Religion\\" group, supports a tritheistic view centered on the god Tura, a mother goddess Ama, and a begotten god who is Tura reborn, and an organisation similar to that of the Catholic Church.Vovina 2000, p. 9. V. Stan'ial, another influential intellectual of the same group, stands for a monistic view with god Tura as the main god and other gods as his manifestations, and an organisational model based on a traditional El'men or national religious leader, and an Aramchi or guardian of the faith in every town. Another group is Turas (meaning \\"believer in the god Tura\\"), started by F. Madurov, which favours a nature religion approach and a pantheistic worldview, asserting that the goal of Chuvash religion is the \\"unity and harmony of nature, mankind and Tura\\". The core of Madurov's position is the concept of the Keremet, the world tree, and the myth of Tura reborn in a tree growing from ashes, symbolizing the rebirth of man through nature.Vovina 2000, pp. 10-11. The keremets are also sacred trees and traditional worship sites spread on Chuvash lands. The immediate goals of the Turas group is the creation of spiritual revival complexes on the sites of the keremets, and to turn them into cultural monuments and natural preserves.Vovina 2000, p. 11. Another phenomenon is the spontaneous revival of traditional village festivals (ialzri). On these occasions, reconstructed prayers and blessings (pil, pekhel) are performed along with ritual sacrifices. Such rituals are connected to community and family life, often involving rites of passage such as weddings, births, and anniversaries.Vovina 2000, pp. 12-13.

With this method it is possible to predict how the bulk magnetization evolves with time under the action of pulses applied in different directions. It is a net improvement from the semi-classical vector model which is not able to predict many of the results in NMR spectroscopy and is a simplification of the complete density matrix formalism. In this model, for a single spin, four base operators exist: I_x, I_y, I_z and E/2 which represent respectively polarization (population difference between the two spin states), single quantum coherence (magnetization on the xy plane) and the unit operator. Many other, non-classical operators exist for coupled systems. Using this approach, the evolution of the magnetization under free precession is represented by I_z and corresponds to a rotation about the z-axis with a phase angle proportional to the chemical shift of the spin in question: I_x \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\omega \\\\tau I_z} \\\\cos (\\\\omega \\\\tau)I_x - \\\\sin (\\\\omega \\\\tau)I_y Pulses about the x and y axis can be represented by I_x and I_y respectively; these allow to interconvert the magnetization between planes and ultimately to observe it at the end of a sequence. Since every spin will evolve differently depending on its shift, with this formalism it is possible to calculate exactly where the magnetization will end up and hence devise pulse sequences to measure the desired signal while excluding others. The product operator formalism is particularly useful in describing experiments in two-dimensions like COSY, HSQC and HMBC.

Life  Leon (Levon) Tutundjian was born in Amasya, in Sivas Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire in 1905. Tutundjian came from a relatively wealthy and educated family-his father and grandfather were teachers. He went to good schools, learned to speak French, and dreamed of moving to Paris. Unfortunately, the family moved often so his father could procure teaching jobs. Tutundjian's life changed dramatically when his father died from cerebral hemorrhage around 1915. Without a primary provider, the family was soon destitute and Tutundjian's mother was forced to sell the family's possessions to care for her children. However, the family did settle down for a time and Tutundjian was able to study at the Berberian and Getronagan schools in Constantinople since his father had taught there. In 1921-22, Tutundjian's mother placed her son on a boat with other Armenian orphans head to Greece from Constantinople. He was sixteen or seventeen years of age at the time, older than most of the orphans, but the separation from his mother was still difficult for him. According to his daughter, because of the sad memories associated with this parting, Tutundjian always hated to travel, particularly on boats. In 1923, he stayed briefly at the Armenian monastery of the Mekhitarist Brotherhood in the St. Lazzaro island of Venice, Italy, where he studied science and Armenian illuminated manuscripts.  As an Artist  In 1924, at the age of nineteen, Tutundjian arrived in Paris and studied art at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He married a French woman in 1933. He had some close friends who were famed artists such as Yervand Kochar. Within two years of his arrival in Paris, he exhibited at the opening of the Galerie Surrealiste, and three years later he was the featured artist in a group show at the Galerie des Editions Bonaparte. He created more than a thousand images of several media and styles. In 1930, he co-founded the group Art Concret with well-known abstract artists Theo van Doesburg, Jean Helion, and Otto G. Carlsund. In 1933, he changed styles abruptly with the figural language of surrealism, which occupied him until 1960, through this long period was interrupted by the events of World War II; first by his brief military service and then by the years under Vichy rule and the war's aftermath. In his early works, he fought the chaos of his experience by transforming it with a balanced artistic vision into ordered and pure artworks. In 1960 he returned to abstraction until his death in 1968.

In the episode, Jack (Alec Baldwin) struggles with confession of his transgressions to wife Avery (Elizabeth Banks) upon her return from North Korea; Criss (James Marsden) tries to fill the traditionally male provider role for a potential child with Liz (Tina Fey); and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) tries to rediscover her southern roots to win a sponsor for her upcoming celebrity wedding. Plot When Jack's wife Avery (Elizabeth Banks) finally returns from captivity in North Korea, she is accompanied by fellow newscaster and American Scott Scottsman (Michael Mosley), who had been a hostage at the same time. Avery offers blanket forgiveness for any infidelity Jack (Alec Baldwin) might have committed during her absence, making Jack suspicious that she is covering up something of her own, probably involving Scott. He gradually reveals the full extent of her flirtation with Avery's mother, Diana, which does not prompt Avery to reveal any secrets. Finally, Jack discovers that the forgiveness was a ploy to get Jack to immediately confess everything he'd done. Jack and Avery rejoice that they are back to their usual competitive relationship and decide to renew their vows, against Liz's advice. When Criss (James Marsden) estimates that home renovations will cost $10,000, he laments that he is not, as a man, able to provide for their household and potential child. Over Liz's protestations that it doesn't matter, he decides to improve his hot dog business. He claims a new spot on the street from some off-brand muppets that harass tourists.

It was directed by Michael Engler, and written by Matt Hubbard. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on May 17, 2012. In the episode, Jack (Alec Baldwin) and Avery (Elizabeth Banks) seek to renew their vows; Criss (James Marsden) sets out to show Liz (Tina Fey) he can pay for their nursery renovation; Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) gives new page Hazel (Kristen Schaal) a place to stay; and Tracy (Tracy Morgan) tries to be less of an embarrassment to African Americans. Plot While watching an interview with Avery and fellow captive Scott Scotsman (Michael Mosley), Jack realizes they communicate with each other using a code of finger taps, and that during their captivity they have been conducting an affair through coded taps. When confronted, Avery admits to her feelings for Scott. Both insist on moving forward with renewing their vows in spite of both this revelation and tension surrounding Jack kissing Avery's mother. Liz officiates at the ceremony, which proceeds smoothly in spite of several aggrieved attendees. When no one speaks out against the marriage, Jack and Avery simultaneously question the crowd, admitting that they only got married because of their baby. They agree to divorce on the spot. Jack finishes the episode admitting to Liz that his love life is a mess. Criss takes out his hot dog truck to raise the money to renovate the nursery, since he believes Liz will bail on him if he can't provide for them. It doesn't go well, but Liz sees his van on the news as the getaway vehicle for a bank robbery. Liz assumes he is guilty and offers to go to jail for him. Finding out that he had sold the van that morning to raise the money, they recommit to have a child together. Hazel needs a place to stay for financial reasons. Kenneth ends up giving her a place to stay, but then Jenna tells him that Hazel sabotaged his re-application to the page program. When he confronts Hazel, she says she has developed feelings for him and they kiss. Tracy discovers that his general buffoonery has left him an embarrassment to African Americans and a comfort to racists. Grizz and Dotcom set up a meeting with Dr. Cornel West to inspire him to do better. Tracy visits a civil rights museum, and there is inspired to emulate Tyler Perry by creating his own studio, solely employing African Americans in creative positions.

Radical journalism The Waynesville, North CarolinaFlorida, Passenger Lists, 1898-1963 native first rose to fame writing for the student journal Wataugan, a publication of North Carolina State University. His articles soon gave him his first reputation as a smalltime radical, as he spoke out in a number of articles. These include \\"Whither the South? Light on the Southern Industrial Revolution\\" attacked Northern Capitalists who came south to exploit Southern Labor, and ‚ÄúMilitarism or Education‚Äîwhich?‚Äù attacked his school's compulsory military training. He soon struck a little too far with \\"The Game of Cheating at North Carolina State College is Not Equal to Any Other Sport,\\" an article that outlined the cheating endemic at the university. Predictably, it was the Student Council that came down hard on him, finding him guilty and expelling him. Abernethy won the case on appeal with the help of faculty, but soon transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a move that proved quite important to his future life.Vickers 18 Contempo years (1931-1934) Soon after transferring to UNC-Chapel Hill, Abernethy joined with several other college students (Phil Liskin, Shirley Carter, Vincent Garoffolo, and Anthony Buttitta) to start a literary magazine known as Contempo. The magazine started as a small publication accepting free submissions. It would eventually publish many of the major authors of the day, including Sherwood Anderson, Ezra Pound, Langston Hughes, William Faulkner, William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane, James Joyce, and others. Abernethy co- edited the magazine with Anthony Buttitta (following the departure of the other three editors by the fall of 1931), and Minna K. Abernethy (his wife, and co-editor following Buttitta's departure). It is likely that Abernethy did a lot of the administrative work for the magazine, as he is said to have been the one to contact authors and bartered for ads at the magazine's beginningButtitta 111 and may have dealt with the financial aspects of the magazine. The editing process itself, though accounts from those associated with the magazine vary, may have been the combined work of both Buttitta and Abernethy, or for a short time, Abernethy, Buttitta, and Minna.Meador 18-19 Abernethy met a number of literary figures during his time at the magazine, including Langston Hughes during his visit to Chapel Hill‚Äîbut his major literary connection with the magazine was with Faulkner. Abernethy met him at a Southern Writers Conference in Charlottesville, Virginia, and eventually accompanied him on a drive to New York City with his professor Paul Green. After an eventful trip, the group arrived and Faulkner was immediately set upon by publishers trying to sign him (due to the success of his novel Sanctuary, and the possible folding of his current publisher). To help him escape, Abernethy accompanied Faulkner on a trip to the South. This trip provided quite a boon for Contempo, as Abernethy invited the author to stay with Buttitta and him in Chapel Hill. This led to Faulkner allowing them access to his rejected manuscripts.Vickers 20-22 The magazine would continue to run through 1934. In 1933, Abernethy became involved in a feud with his former co-editor, Buttitta. This feud, possibly started by the inclusion of Abernethy's wife as an editor, involved Buttitta setting up a rival Contempo in the nearby city of Durham, North Carolina. Abernethy defended the \\"true\\" Contempo in a series of printed statements in the magazine.Meador 22-25 Early business ventures (1931-1953) Abernethy also founded or co-founded a bookstore known as the Intimate Bookshop in 1931. The bookstore, which developed in tandem with the magazine, and served as its headquarters, would outlast both Contempo and Abernethy's ownership. Initially an operation run out of his college dorm room, the bookshop moved to a second floor location in the Tankersly Building in Chapel Hill,Meador 9-11 and eventually to the Patterson Building on July 25, 1932.Meador 12 The bookstore was supposedly started using a combination of Abernethy's collection of avant-garde books and review-books used for the magazine.Buttitta 11 Abernethy may have had other eccentric methods of collecting books. Stories exist of Abernethy, whose mission was to sell everything from the ‚ÄúManifesto to the Bible,‚Äù possibly buying 10,000 copies of the Communist Manifesto and selling them for 10 cents each. Other accounts have him picking books used textbooks out of trashcans at the end of the semester.Meador 30-31 Abernethy supposedly had a number of eccentric policies. He would allow people to stay in the bookstore all night, simply locking them inside the building when he left. He was also known to loan books, to buy books back after people had read them, and supposedly, to keep records on the bathroom wall.Meador 29-30 Minna Abernethy ran the Intimate Bookshop for a brief period when Abernethy served in the military from 1943-1946.Meador 14 The Intimate Bookshop was the first of a number of small businesses with which Abernethy was associated. He would sell office supplies, typewriters, and records through the Intimate Bookshop, and may have started selling furniture as well. By the late 1930s, had grown successful enough to buy the Patterson building (the second building to house the Intimate Bookshop) for $4700.Meador 31 Accused of communist activity (June‚ÄìSeptember 1953) Abernethy's association with leftwing causes dates back to at least his time writing for the student journal at North Carolina State University. Contempo would oftentimes feature left-leaning reviews, articles, and literature, further suggesting his association with leftwing ideas. Abernethy would eventually be accused of Communist activities in the 1950s. Initial response in the town was negative, though he would later receive quite a bit of support from locals who defended him. One supporter claimed no one took his Communism seriously.Meador 34-35 It is certain that Abernethy had some level of communist involvement. Besides his association with the left-leaning Contempo magazine, Abernethy also made a trip to the Soviet Union in 1935.Vickers 28 There is the possibility that he ran a press in the back of the Intimate Bookshop. These activities and this press would eventually get Abernethy in trouble in the 1950s. Abernethy was accused by Paul Crouch, a district manager for the Communist Party in North and South Carolina. At this time, this press came under particular scrutiny. It may have been used to print communist literature; it may have also been a broken down press that barely worked, or it could have been used to print American Federation of Labor handbills so Abernethy could earn some extra money. The press was widely considered to be an ‚Äúunderground‚Äù press in the newspapers of the day, though one supporter pointed out that there would have been no reason to keep it a secret in the 1930s.Meador 32-35 The accusations initially caused the Abernethy's a lot of grief. They withdrew their children from the local schools, sending one to a school in Chicago; and they eventually sold their businesses and left town in 1955.Meador 36 Final business ventures and death (1953-1991) Abernethy was quite successful following his departure from Chapel Hill. He moved to New York City, and eventually became a successful stockbroker, a job that allowed him to have a residence on Riverside Drive, and to spend his summers in Hampton Bays, New York, on Long Island.Meador 40 He also owned a lot of valuable property in Chapel Hill.Meador 37 He died in 1991 in Hampton Bays; his ashes were spread at his daughter and grandson's house off Jones Ferry Road in Chapel Hill.

He attended MIT where he obtained a S.B. and S.M. in Mechanical Engineering (1971). He obtained his Ph.D. in 1978 at UCSD in the Biology Department working with Bruno H. Zimm, studying the biophysical properties of DNA molecules. Towards the end of his doctoral research, he had become interested in the mechanics of protein folding, specifically the way that the RNA-degrading enzyme Ribonuclease, folds into its native state. But before tackling the protein folding problem, he moved to Stanford University and worked with Paul J. Flory in Chemistry, for his post-doctoral training. There, he indirectly studied cellular structures by focusing on the structural dynamics of micelles. After this, he returned to California, to University of California, San Francisco, where he popularized the idea that any given protein's surrounding environment places constraints upon it, such that the shapes that it can assume are dramatically decreased. Mathematically, this can be visualized as a funnel, in which the several unfolded and misfolded high energy states of the protein occupy positions nearer the top of the funnel, but once the protein begins to fold, its options narrow down and it rapidly collapses into its most stable, low energy state. In Dill's words, \\"Like skiers all arriving at the same lodge, the folding protein gets systematically closer to the desired protein shape as it moves down the funnel\\".

The operation was launched on 29 January in conjunction with Operation Star and aimed against Voroshilovgrad, Donetsk and then towards the Sea of Azov to cut off all German forces east of Donetsk.

This price is set periodically, usually monthly and serves as a guideline for international trade in the commodity. The term \\"benchmark\\" can be applied to many aspects of public concern, such as quality, services, attitudes and others, denoting the highest standards achieved in such spheres. For example, a school or university could be cited as setting the benchmark for education. A hotel could be cited as setting the benchmark for quality of service. The phrase \\"international benchmark price\\", however, is synonymous with prices of commodities in international trade. Benchmark prices apply to all commodities. An example is the benchmark prices that apply to crude oil in the international marketplace. It is not mandatory for exporting countries or importing countries to use the benchmark price as international trade is based on favourable prices. Traders use the benchmark price as a guide for spot trading and trading in commodity futures. The benchmark price is often the most important consideration when determining export prices. A commodity will sell for more or less than the benchmark price depending on how it compares to the benchmark commodity (percentage of undesirable components such as sulfur, for example) and where it is to be delivered, if other than the benchmark price's delivery point.

Plot  The film focuses on the life of a group of riot control force policemen, the Celerini, and their life in Rome \\"cleansing\\" stadiums of Ultras, public demonstrations, evictions and everyday family life. A new recruit, Adriano Costantini, joins the squad for its \\"high-paying\\" salary, which he needs to support his mother. The two of them live in a small apartment from which they'll soon be evicted and, even though they had been assigned a public housing, that has been abusively occupied by an immigrant family and is therefore uninhabitable. Adriano is prone to violence and often prefers the use of force even in situations where it is unnecessary, additionally fueled by the anger he feels over his mother's situation. Mazinga is the leader of the squad and father of a rebellious teenager who starts to hang out with a neo-fascist group and is embarrassed by his father's job. Mazinga gets stabbed during a confrontation at the stadium and loses control of one of his legs, prompting a manhunt for the culprit from his colleagues. Negro, another member of the group, is going through a difficult divorce and is denied visitations with his daughter. Cobra is the most dedicated member of the team. He believes in protecting his \\"brothers\\" in arms above anything else, no matter the errors they may have committed. He believes in the job he's doing but sometimes the lines between protecting his fellow policemen and respecting the law get blurred. He may be one of the most violent members of the squad, also facing trial for beating a supporter during a football match.

Following regulatory and administrative investigations, criminal trials and a subsequent appeal, on 15 December 2014 Craig Thomson, a former national secretary of the HSU and a former Labor politician, was found guilty in the Victorian County Court of thirteen charges of theft, and later convicted and fined A$25,000. Other charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception were dismissed on appeal. His conviction followed an appeal against a conviction and sentence in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 25 March 2014 when Thomson was found guilty of 65 charges of fraud and theft for using Health Services Union funds for personal benefit; and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, with nine months suspended over two years. Thomson was initially released on bail; and the conviction and sentence subsequently overturned on appeal. In October 2013, Michael Williamson, a former national president of the HSU, a former general secretary of HSUeast, and a former union and Labor right-wing factional power broker, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud totaling nearly A$1 million from HSUeast, one charge of fabricating invoices and another charge of recruiting others to hinder a police investigation. An earlier independent report commissioned by the union detailed that companies associated with Williamson and his family had allegedly fraudulently received more than $5 million from HSUeast in the period from 2006 to 2011. In the NSW District Court in March 2014, Williamson was sentenced to sevenandahalf years of imprisonment; with a nonparole period of five years. civil proceedings against Thomson and Williamson were pending.  Background  The Health Services Union (HSU) was officially formed in 1991 by the amalgamation of the Hospital Employees' Federation (HEF) and the Health and Research Employees Association (HREA).

The membership of the union includes doctors, nurses and allied health professionals such as physiotherapists and radiographers, ambulance officers, clerical and administrative staff, managers and support staff in the health and aged care sectors. The HSUeast branch, covering New South Wales, Victoria, ant the Australian Capital Territory, was controversially formed in 2010, following years of factional fighting between leadership teams from the HSU New South Wales, HSU Victorian No. 1 and No. 3 branches. Thomson started his career representing hospital and ambulance workers in New South Wales as an industrial officer for the HREA. He became head of the HREA Industrial Department. He was subsequently elected to the position of Assistant Secretary. In 2002, Thomson was elected as the national secretary of the HSU. After a seemingly successful career in the union movement, Thomson was endorsed as Labor's candidate for the federal seat of Dobell on the NSW Central Coast and won the seat at the 2007 federal election. He was re-elected as the Member for Dobell in 2010, representing Labor. Williamson rose to prominence as an official of the HSU, representing the interests of low-paid workers in the health sector in New South Wales and then Australia. Williamson was general secretary of HSU NSW branch, later to become HSUeast, serving in this role between 1997 until June 2012. He was elected as the inaugural national president of the union in 2003 until October 2011. During his term as national president he controversially merged the NSW and two Victorian branches of the union to create HSUeast. He was elected as the national president of the Australian Labor Party, serving between 2009 and 2010; and was a vice president of NSW Labor. Williamson was also a vice president of Unions NSW until April 2012. He was a member of the national executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU); a trustee of First State Super; and a non-executive director of SGE Credit Union, a credit union for NSW Government employees. Following Thomson's move into politics, his successor as national secretary was Kathy Jackson, a protege of Williamson. Jackson rose through the ranks of the HSUeast branch and its predecessors in Victoria, and was aligned with Labor's moderate Unity faction. Jackson's former husband, Jeff Jackson, was general secretary of the Victorian branch of the HSU, that had been placed into administration in 2009 by the Federal Court after tensions between factional parties could not be resolved.  Allegations of impropriety  Succeeding Thomson as general secretary of the HSU in January 2008, Kathy Jackson identified financial irregularities in the union's accounts and engaged external auditors to investigate. Reporting in May, the audit raised \\"concerns about evidence of misuse of union funds by Mr Thomson.\\" In December, the union engaged tax specialists BDO Kendall to \\"conduct an investigation\\" over the alleged improper use of Thomson's union-issued corporate credit card. The Sydney Morning Herald revealed the allegations in April 2009; Thomson denied all wrongdoing and stated that an independent audit had not identified any inappropriate use of the card, noted that other people would have been able to incur charges on the account, and said the accusations had been fabricated by rivals within the HSU. = Inquiries by Australian government agencies = Fair Work Australia, the federal workplace relations regulator and tribunal, conducted a three-year investigation into improprieties in the use of union funds involving both the Victorian No. 1 Branch, and the national office of the HSU. On 23 December 2011, the appointed investigator, Terry Nassios, produced the Victoria No.1 report, which was publicly released publicly on 16 March 2012. The report, consisting of 183 findings, was tabled in the Senate on 7 May 2012. Within this report, 153 findings pertained to Thomson's breaches of union rules and sections 237(1), 285(1), 286(1), and 287(1) of Schedule 1 of the . The Fair Work Australia investigations were criticised for failing to investigate the finances of the HSU following a petition in July 2009 by the members of HSU No. 4 Branch. On 15 October 2012 Fair Work Australia launched civil proceedings against Thomson related to his use of HSU funds. Thomson stated that he would contest these charges. Following the release of the Fair Work Australia report, the Australian Federal Police commenced investigations. Thomson claimed he was not one of the five people of interest. = Other investigations = In 2011 the Union Council of the HSUeast branch resolved to commence an investigation into the financial affairs of the branch; and sought counsel from the President of the New South Wales Bar Association to select an independent panel of experts to investigate: * adequacy of governance arrangements and business practices of HSUeast; * access to financial and business related information for union members to ensure transparency and scrutiny; * policies and procedures and potential conflicts of interest for office bearers, or staff that hold directorships or shares/ownership in companies that supply goods to HSUeast; * policies around the use of HSUeast credit cards; and * other matters the panel deems appropriate. Following an interim report delivered in April 2012 and a final report delivered in July 2012, Ian Temby and Dennis Robertson, an accountant, found that $20 million was paid by HSUeast without any form of tendering or contract. This included $5 million paid to companies operated by Williamson and his wife. Prime Minister Julia Gillard commented that \\"It's clear that there have been real problems at the HSU. That‚Äôs distressing I think to everyone who cares about working people.\\" Meanwhile, NSW Police officers raided the union's Sydney office on 2 May 2012, seizing documents and computers as part of the \\"Strike Force Carnarvon\\" investigation into secret commissions allegedly received by Williamson and Thomson. Williamson was intercepted in a basement attempting to remove a bag of documents.  Credit card misuse by an official of the HSU national office  The report by Fair Work Australia (FWA) concluded that Thomson had spent almost $ of union members' funds on his 2007 election federal campaign for Dobell. This included $ for two political staff members who worked on the campaign, and another $ directly expended on the campaign. Other money, including from Thomson's union credit card, was used to pay for office supplies including furniture and utility connections. Following his election in 2007 as the Member for Dobell, Thomson resigned from the HSU on 14 December 2007. On 18 May 2012 it was reported that Terry Nassios, the FWA investigator stated that he was unsure if some payments by Thomson had been made on the card after that date and that he recommended the payments after the resignation date be reported to the public prosecutor for investigation. During Question Time on 16 August 2011, Prime Minister Gillard was asked if her confidence in Thomson was based on a thorough investigation of his credibility. She replied, \\"I have complete confidence in the member for Dobell. I look forward to him continuing to do that job for a very long, long, long time to come.\\" Gillard later moved to suspend Thomson from the Labor Party on 29 April 2012, saying \\"At the moment, Australian voters see a dark cloud over Parliament. I have made a judgment about the Parliament and about respect for the Parliament. There is a line which has been crossed here.\\" She said the decision was solely hers but that Thomson agreed with her. Later he stated that he had had different reasons for leaving the party than those given by the Prime Minister. In an address to the House on 21 May 2012 Thomson said that there were credit cards which showed expenditure on escorts and prostitutes for at least two other officials. He implied that Jeff Jackson, a former HSU executive member and the former husband of Kathy Jackson, the HSU national secretary, was one of two officials responsible for the spending on prostitutes, a claim earlier made by HSU branch president Pauline Fegan. Thomson's allegations were rejected by the union figures he named as being able to support his claims, including his half-brother, former union official Struan Robertson. Thomson questioned the impartiality of the investigation. Michael Lawler the Vice President of FWA was involved in internal HSU politics at the request of his partner Kathy Jackson. Jackson allegedly supplied most of the documents used by the FWA in its HSU national office investigation. Nassios, citing a newspaper report, stated $ had been repaid by Jeff Jackson in settlement of three payments of $ identified as \\"back pay\\" dishonestly claimed. When asked by Fair Work Australia to clarify if this claim pertained to Jackson, Thomson declined to provide any details, citing legal advice. On 15 October 2012 Fair Work Australia launched civil proceedings against Thomson related to his misuse of HSU funds. Thomson stated that he would contest these charges. Thomson was later arrested, charged with 140 offences relating to theft and fraud, and trialled by judge in the Melbourne Magistrates Court. On 18 February 2014 he was found guilty of theft from the HSU and of defrauding the HSU. Thomson had misused his union credit card to pay for prostitutes, travel expenses and cigarettes, and for accommodation and dinners even after he'd left the union to run for Parliament. On 25 March 2014, Thomson was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with nine months suspended for two years. Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg said Thomson shown \\"arrogance in the extreme\\", a \\"breach of trust of the highest order\\" in misusing members' funds and said Thomson had shown no remorse. The magistrate also said \\"Nothing has been put before me to suggest that these offences were committed for anything other than greed\\". Thomson was granted bail to appear in the Victorian County Court on 24 November to appeal both his conviction and sentence. Following his conviction and sentencing, on 4 April 2014 the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party expelled Thomson as a member of the party. Thomson was proven guilty of thirteen charges of theft, convicted, and fined A$25,000.  Financial irregularities within the HSUeast branch  Allegations of improprieties in the HSUeast branch were first publicly revealed in The Sydney Morning Herald on 9 September 2011. It was alleged the Thomson (whilst serving as national secretary to the HSU) and Williamson (as the general secretary of the HSUeast) received secret commissions from a major supplier to the union. The supplier, that produces ten issues of the union's newsletter, Health Standard, at a price estimated to be ten times the amount for similar productions, provided both Thomson and Williamson with credit cards that were used for personal expenses, such as private school fees. This was the first occasion that Williamson was implicated in any matter. The media report detailed that Williamson was a director of a computer company, United Edge, that provided information technology services to the HSUeast branch, without going to competitive tender. This decision was made while Williamson was general secretary of HSUeast. Following the public airing of allegations, Williamson's position as national president of the HSU became untenable, and he was suspended as president in October 2011. In April 2012 he resigned as president from Uninos NSW after being asked to explain to its executive why he should not be removed. Williamson's position as the general secretary of HSUeast was dissolved when the Federal Court declared all elected positions vacant in June 2012; appointing an administrator to run the union's affairs. The final Temby report, delivered in July 2012 at the request of the HSUeast Union Council, made findings that Williamson engaged in irregularities, such as placing family members in union jobs, paying inflated prices for services, and heading United Edge, a company supplying information technology services to the union. On 4 October 2012, Williamson was charged with more than 50 offences relating to fraud and obstruction of justice, and was suspended as director of United Edge. Appearing before the Sydney Magistrates Court on 15 October 2013, Williamson entered a guilty plea to four major charges related to cheating and defrauding the HSU East branch, creating false documents with the intention to deceive and the recruiting of others to hinder a police investigation. All other charges were dropped. No charges were laid against Williamson's wife or family members. On 3 March 2014, legal counsel for Williamson declined to seek a bail extension and Williamson was imprisoned. He was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales on 28 March 2014 to sevenandahalf years of imprisonment; with a nonparole period of five years, ending in March 2019. Following his conviction and imprisonment, on 4 April 2014 the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party expelled Williamson as a member of the party.  Suspension of the HSU from the Australian Council of Trade Unions  In April 2012 the Australian Council of Trade Unions votedThe vote in support was 1 797 to 103 opposed, a 94.5% ratio. to suspend the membership of the HSU on the basis of corruption. Following government action, the Federal Court of Australia removed the union's national executive and appointed judge Michael Moore as administrator. On 15 May 2012, ACTU president Ged Kearney addressed the ACTU congress on the HSU scandal. \\"I know I speak for everyone in this room when I say that misuse of member's money and contempt for the accountability to members are unacceptable\\", she said. Union figure Paul Howes stressed the positive, addressing the congress: Gillard said of the HSU's impact on the Australian union movement's reputation, \\"...the very poor conduct of one union risks tarnishing that reputation.\\"  Political ramifications  Gillard spoke in support of a parliamentary code of conduct, saying, \\"I do want to see members of Parliament always doing the right thing. There are various rules now for members of Parliament but I'm obviously open to suggestions that we have a code of conduct.\\" Independent MP Tony Windsor flagged action along with Rob Oakeshott to increase Parliament's powers to deal with cases such as Thomson's. \\"I think that there is a need for, if people are proven to be guilty in some of these circumstances, that Parliament may need some greater power or have a process where they actually leave the building\\", he said. In April 2012 Thomson asked to be suspended from the Labor Party after a discussion with Gillard, and announced his intention to sit on the crossbench as an independent member of parliament. In a statement to the House on 21 May 2012, Thomson professed his innocence and used parliamentary privilege to name a number of individuals and claim that he was set up. He recontested his seat at the 2013 federal election, but lost to the Liberals' Karen McNamara. In February 2014 the coalition government announced a proposed Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption to inquire into alleged financial irregularities associated with the affairs of trade unions. The HSU was one of five unions named in the commission's proposed terms of reference. Following criminal proceedings where Thomson was found guilty of theft and fraud charges, the Federal Parliament voted in favour of a motion of \\"regret\\" and apologised to the individuals named in Thomson's statement to the House on 21 May 2012. The matter was also referred to Parliament's Privileges Committee to investigate whether Thomson deliberately misled the House.

It commemorates the men and women who have served or are currently serving in the Royal Canadian Navy. The monument was designed by artist Al McWilliams and architects Joost Bakker and Bruce Haden, and was officially opened by then Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, on 3 May 2012. Design and location The Royal Canadian Navy Monument was commissioned by the National Capital Commission and Royal Canadian Navy, who jointly launched a design competition in 2009. The competition was won by a team based in Vancouver, British Columbia, comprising artist and sculptor Al McWilliams, and architects Joost Bakker and Bruce Haden. The mast and theatre entrance The monument forms a small park, situated at the tip of Richmond Landing in Ottawa, Canada's capital. Richmond Landing is a short peninsula that projects into the Ottawa River from its southern, Ontario, bank, just to the east of Victoria Island and the Chaudi√®re Falls, the highest point on the Ottawa River that is navigable from the sea. Richmond Landing was the arrival site for some of the first settlers in the Ottawa region. The monument is surrounded on three sides by the river and is overlooked by Parliament Hill, including the Centre Block of the Parliament of Canada. The monument consists of a shallow turf Roman theatre, approximately in diameter, that faces downriver to the east. The open end of the theatre is focused on a large, inclined sail-like feature, five to eight metres in height, that is clad in slightly mottled white marble and is topped by a gilded sphere, somewhat offset. On the western face of the north‚Äìsouth orientated sail the motto \\"Ready Aye Ready\\" and its French translation, \\"Pr√™t Oui Pr√™t\\", are carved in the uppermost corner. The theatre honours of the Royal Canadian Navy are carved into the eastern face. The sail is set into a pavement of pale grey granite, with a fouled anchor symbol inlaid in contrasting black granite. A white mast carrying a yard, gaff and rigging, topped by a small gilded sphere, is situated to the south of the amphitheatre's open area. The monument is approached via an entrance from the landward end of the peninsula, cut through the western side of the theatre bank, that is lined with the same grey granite as surrounds the focal sail. The design evokes a number of aspects of Canada and its navy, and was intended as \\"a form and space charged with meaning\\". Being surrounded on three sides by water, the position of the monument reflects Canada's own geographical position. The colours of the monument ‚Äì white, black and gold ‚Äì are those of the Royal Canadian Navy. The sail-like feature carries multiple interpretations, including a sail, a ship's hull, an iceberg or naval attire. The golden spheres used on both the sail and mast represent celestial bodies and the navy's global reach.

His paintings are in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Guggenheim. Born in Chicago, Illinois, he attended Yale University and the Ecole Des Beaux Arts in France. An educator as well as an artist, Wolff was a professor of art at the Chicago Institute of Design (originally the New Bauhaus, now the IIT Institute of Design), before moving to Brooklyn College where he was chairman of the department from 1946 to 1964. He has written numerous articles on art and is the author-designer of the widely known educational portfolio Elements of Design, published by the Museum of Modern Art. He also wrote at least three children's books about color. Robert Jay Wolff's formal art training began with night school at the Chicago Art Institute in 1928 and ended with a few months in the sculpture atelier of the French academician Henri Bouchard at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris in 1930. Remaining in Paris, Wolff worked independently: \\"My masters were the stone cutters of archaic Greece. The bronze sculptures of Charles Despiau seemed to me the only contemporary works that could approach the purity and grandeur of the stone figures of the Sixth Century B.C.,\\" he recalled. \\"Much of my time, when not working, was spent in the far corner of the basement of the Louvre surrounded by ancient Greece.\\" Paris in 1929 and 1930 was alive with the new art of the School of Paris, and Wolff saw paintings by Miro, Matisse, Picasso, and Braque and the sculpture of Brancusi, Zadkine, Gonzales, Archipenko. \\"They all held an inescapable fascination for young and uncommitted eyes,\\" he wrote years later. Wolff returned to Chicago in 1932, where he continued to work in sculpture. \\"I worked always from life, mostly heads; and though a certain likeness always resulted my first concern was with the sculpture as an object, as a fully realized volume of planes intersecting planes, of an infinite diversity of contours, of surfaces patiently growing to the fullness of a living essence. Wolff spent hours drawing. \\"My studio in Chicago was a seventh-floor loft in an old building on Wacker Drive at Wabash Avenue. My windows faced west, and looked down on the busy Chicago River. The river stretched out before me, its bridges one after the other rising and descending with the coming and going of boats and ships of all kinds, large and small. The tall buildings of the Loop towered over me to the south while across the river to the north and west there was the contrast of dingy old warehouses and wharfs.\\" \\"Between 1929 and 1931 I had done a series of wash drawings from my window high up in Passy overlooking Paris and it was in these that I discovered how the aggressive tangibility of spaces could dissolve the concrete object world.\\" Wolff's sculpture received prizes in juried shows at the Chicago Art Institute in 1933 and 1934, and in a one-man exhibition in 1935. But the artist was already turning from sculpture toward painting, what he called, \\"exciting but, in a sense, terrifying excursions into this new and strange realm of subjectively expressive abstraction.\\" From 1936 on Wolff expressed himself in abstract painting: \\"Spaces of magic light and vivid color, emptied of fixed points of reference, of self-enclosed objects and locally isolated things, color spaces containing only the heavy black lines of brush strokes that defined their limits; this was what emerged....with a kind of furious aimlessness. I was not sure what it was that was happening, but I knew that what ever it was it was vividly alive. This was the here and now of my life. I had taken the long, final step out of the shelter of art history and I found that I was quite alone.\\" Wolff became a member of Abstract American Artists in 1937 and exhibited with the group. Wolff joined with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Gyorgy Kepes in 1938 when they established the Chicago Institute of Design, the American revival of the German Bauhaus school. After World War II Wolff was professor of Art at Brooklyn College, where as department chairman his faculty included Ad Reinhardt, Burgoyne Diller, Stanley Hayter, Carl Holty and Mark Rothko. Wolff's book Essays on Art and Learning, was published in 1971. Wolff's work is represented in collections including: Art Institute of Chicago, Brooklyn Museum of Art, estate of Alexander Calder, estate of Marcel Breuer, The Guggenheim, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Tate in London, and the Wadsworth Athenaeum.

De Williams ran a further 864 km to Darwin before learning that she had broken both navicular bones in her feet and that surgery would be required. On 6 June 2009 at GPS co-ordinates S 13¬∞ 03.130' E 131¬∞06.663', De Williams ended her attempt to run around Australia after 224 days and 10,824.8 km. Even though the first attempt was disrupted, De Williams raised over $100,000 for the National Breast Cancer foundation and became the first female to run from Hobart (the southernmost capital city in Australia) to Darwin (the northernmost capital city in Australia). Run around Australia ‚Äì 2nd attempt, March 2010 ‚Äì May 2011 On 27 March 2010, after recovering from surgery to both feet, De Williams started her second attempt from Hobart, Tasmania to become the first female to run continuously around Australia and raise funds for breast cancer research. De Williams ran in the opposite direction from her first attempt, travelling clockwise through Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. On 4 October 2010, at 5.35am (ACST) after running 192 days and 8839.4 km De Williams reach GPS co-ordinates S 13¬∞ 03.130' E 131¬∞06.663' the point where she had abandoned her run in 2009. At this point De Williams became the first female to run the around Australia, non‚Äìcontinuously. De Williams continued back down the east coast of Australia, along the same route she travelled on her first attempt. During her run down the east coast De Williams braved extreme heat, a tropical cyclone on Christmas Day 2010 in Townsville and the devastating 2010-2011 Queensland Floods. On 6 May 2011, at 1.12pm (AEST) after running 17925 km in 405 days, at GPS co-ordinates S 42¬∞ 46.435' E 147¬∞07.591', De Williams broke Sarah Fulcher's 21-year record for the longest continuous run by a female. De Williams then continued to run for another two days, finally completing her run around Australia on 8 May 2011, at the Hobart Mothers' Day Classic. De Williams ran a total of 18026.4 km in 408 days to achieve a new record for the longest continuous run by a female and is also the first female to run continuously around Australia. During both attempts to run around Australia, De Williams raised over $200,000 for breast cancer research and her journey gave hope to breast cancer sufferers, inspired survivors that there is life after cancer, and honoured those who lost their lives to the disease. Running Pink In 2006, De Williams was diagnosed with breast cancer. As she underwent treatment De Williams decided to establish Running Pink. Running Pink is a nonprofit organization with Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status that raises funds for breast cancer research, awareness and survivorship programs.

Chepzi is close to Chumar area, which has been witness to a large number of incursions by the Chinese People's Liberation Army since 2011.  Geography  AMS, 1954) Chepzi is on the bank of the Pare Chu river, close to Tibet's border with Ladakh. The Pare Chu river originates in India's Himachal Pradesh, flows through Ladakh, turns southeast near Chumar to flow into the 'Tsotso district' in West Tibet (as the British called it). Finally, Pare Chu reenters Himachal Pradesh again to join the Spiti River. The British also observed that the Tsotso district was the most populous area in the basin of Pare Chu. Near Chepzi, two tributaries join Pare Chu: the Kyumsalung Panglung (or simply Panglung) river from the east, and the Chepzilung (or simply Chepzi) river from the west. The Chepzilung originates below the Gya Peak, a key point on the border between Spiti (Himachal Pradesh) and Tibet. A. K. Singh, Yousuf Zaheer, The Continuing Story of Gya, The Himalayan Journal, Vol. 55, 199. According to the map drawn by Frederic Drew, who worked as a geologist in the administration of Jammu and Kashmir, these two tributaries were border rivers of Ladakh. The notes to the map provided by him state that the subjects of Jammu and Kashmir grazed their cattle in the pasture-lands up to the boundary, while the subjects of Tibet did likewise on their side. = Indian boundary definition = Kashmir geologist Frederic Drew's border in 1874 thumbright270pxChinese and Indian claim lines in the Chumar Sector in 2012 [https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford- jd523yw3613 Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB), Europe and Asia, 2012], EarthWorks, Stanford University, retrieved and annotated 11 October 2020. By the time of Indian independence in 1947, the Indians appear to have conceded the valley of Chepzilung to the Tibetans, and withdrawn to the watershed ridge to its north. When independent India defined its boundaries in 1954, it also withdrew from the Panglung river to the east of Chepzi, and set the watershed ridge as the boundary. On the Pare Chu river itself, the Indian- defined border is 5 miles south of the Ladakhi village of Chumar, which is approximately 2 miles north of Chepzi. : \\"Thereafter [the boundary] turns westward and crosses the Pare river about five miles south of Chumar to reach Gya Peak ([Lat. and Long.] ).\\" This allows the Tibetan graziers unrestriced access to both the tributary rivers of Pare Chu at Chepzi. The combined effect of these decisions gave the appearance of a \\"bulge\\" in Indian territory near the Pare Chu river. The Indian government justified it on the grounds that the Ladakh's inhabitants had traditionally used the grazing lands along Pare Chu right up to Chepzi. : \\"Similarly, the inhabitants of Ranle and Rupshu Ilaqas have always been using the pastures lying south of Chumar up to the Chepzelung and Kumsanglung streams on either side of the Pare River.\\" The people of Chumar claim to have continued using the farmland and grazing grounds at Chepzi until the recent past. They claim that their access to these lands has been blocked by the People's Liberation Army in recent years.Stanzin Dasal, How China Is Quietly Moving its Borders into India, VICE News, 3 August 2020. The Indian Army has said that the Chepzi grazing grounds were \\"beyond the Indian borders.\\" But the locals are adamant that the Army does not understand their traditional grazing systems.Locals in Ladakh demand restoration of mobile services to ease war fear, The Economic Times, 5 June 2020. = Chinese claims = In the 1960 boundary talks with India, China claimed a boundary north of the Indian claim line. However it was still south of the general ridge line running across the Pare Chu valley. : \\"It then runs westwards and crosses the Pare River at its junction with a small stream (approximately ) to reach the tri-junction of China's Ari district and India's Punjab [now Himachal Pradesh] and Ladakh (approximately ).\\" By 2012, China was claiming a boundary further north, representing a \\"bulge\\" of its own territory, as shown in the United States Office of the Geographer's boundary datasets. (See map.)  People's Liberation Army base  Chepzi used to be the farthest duty point for the 'hill frontier defence company' in the Ari Army Division. The closest army station used to be 720 km away with 16 mountain passes along the way. Up until 2009, the Army Aviation Force of the Xinjiang Military Command used to airdrop supplies to the PLA troops at Chepzi. According to a report of Sina Military, PLA troops could not be permanently stationed there at that time. In 2011, the PLA established a border defence company in Manza, which is about 140 km away within the 'Tsotso' district. A Chepzi Highway linking Chepzi to the provincial road Y706 has also been constructed. In March 2014, the Zanda Border Battalion commander Qi Fabao has been stationed in Chepzi.  Border incidents  According to a report in Sina Military, the Indian Army constructed \\"fortifications\\" at Chumar in 2011 and it was said that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) demolished them when the Indian troops withdrew for winter.

Indian media stated that loose stones had been assembled into the shape of \\"bunkers\\" by the soldiers at a location near the border, some 200‚Äì300 metres into Indian territory. The PLA personnel arrived in helicopters and dismantled them over a period of 20‚Äì25 minutes. Indian media described the event as a \\"shocker\\". Headlines Today Bureau, Chinese troops had dismantled bunkers on Indian side of LoAC in August 2011, India Today, 25 April 2013. Since this time, it is said that helicopter incursions by the PLA have occurred almost every year. PTI, Chinese troops enter Chumar again; vandalise Indian posts, The Economic Times, 9 July 2013. In April 2013, a major standoff occurred at Depsang Bulge in northern Ladakh (some 500 km to the north), where the Chinese troops intruded 19 km into Indian territory near Burtsa and pitched tents for three weeks. As a condition for their withdrawal, they demanded the dismantling of a tin shed set up by the local Indian commander at Chumar at the patrol point called \\"30 R\\", which is said to be virtually on the Line of Actual Control. India conceded the demand. Sushant Singh, Explained: Six years ago, how a standoff in Ladakh ended after discussion, The Indian Express, 16 June 2020. : \\"Some 500 km from the 17,000 feet high plains of Depsang, the Indian Army constructed a tin shed to cover a point known as ‚Äò30 R‚Äô in Chumar, eastern Ladakh. The ‚Äò30 R‚Äô point was within the LOP authorized by the CSG and the Cabinet Committee on Security in 1976, but it was also an area under dispute which virtually sat on the LAC... At 7.30 p.m. on 5 May, both sides disengaged from Depsang plains and the Indian troops returned to their old position in Chumar after dismantling the ‚Äò30 R‚Äô tin shed.\\" The Chinese commentators described the tactic as \\"Besiege Wei to rescue Zhao\\". Within a few months, the PLA troops were back at the border and cut the wires for the Indian surveillance cameras at he border. In December 2013, they were reported to have intruded into Indian territory again and apprehended five Indian herders along with their cattle. This was reported to have occurred 5 km inside the Indian territory. A major standoff at the Chumar border itself occurred in 2014. According to the Indian government sources, more than 200 PLA troops arrived at the border along with twelve heavy vehicles, cranes and bulldozers, trying to construct a road into the Indian territory. The Indian troops confronted them and asked them to withdraw, which resulted in as many as seven face-offs. Some 15‚Äì20 metres of temporary track laid by the Chinese troops was demolished by the Indians. The standoff escalated with more than 1000 troops arrayed on each side. The confrontation ended only after the foreign ministers of the two countries met and agreed that there would be no road-laying or fresh construction in the areas claimed by both the sides.

After 1909, Mahmud Pasha took part in the modernization of the Ottoman army under the auspices of German High Command. He served as the Minister of Public Works in the CUP government. When World War I broke out in 1914, Mahmud Pasha opposed the Ottoman participation in view of the unpreparedness of the armed forces. He was known as an outspoken but a respected figure in the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Later in the war, Mahmud Pasha served as the Minister of the Navy in the CUP cabinet of Talaat Pasha. In 1914, Mahmud Pasha's candidacy was put forward by the Sultan to serve in the Ottoman Senate (Ayan Meclisi). After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in WW I, Mahmud Pasha led the commission to negotiate peace. Mahmud Pasha's support for territorial concessions to reach an agreement with Armenians in 1919 drew criticism from Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. On March 22, 1920, Mahmud Pasha was among the few CUP members arrested and sent by the British authorities for a tribunal in Malta. Upon their repatriation in 1921, he returned to Turkey.

Early years The Stoddard family was one of the oldest and richest in Worcester, Massachusetts. Stoddard attended the Bancroft School in Worcester, then Worcester Academy, graduating in 1924. He went on to Yale University, and later said his opposition to Communism formed at that time. He had attended a Communist rally and what he heard made him opposed to communism for life. He married Helen Estabrook Stoddard in 1933. Wyman-Gordon The Stoddards owned Wyman-Gordon, a major company that manufactured forgings for the automotive, aerospace and gas turbine industries. Robert Stoddard joined Wyman-Gordon in 1929. He succeeded his father Harry G. Stoddard as president in 1955. Stoddard was opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which would make racial discrimination illegal. In 1964, the company employed black workers only as janitors. Abbie Hoffman was the press officer for a group of civil-rights agitators who targeted the Worcester plant for picketing. Later, they filed petitions with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the U.S, Air Force. In July that year, the company agreed to change its hiring practices. Stoddard was elected chairman of Wyman-Gordon in 1967. He retired from the company in 1972. Worcester Telegram & Gazette The Worcester Telegram and Evening Gazette were separate newspapers founded in the 19th century. T.T. Ellis bought both papers in 1920, and sold them in 1925 to Harry Stoddard, Robert's father, and George Booth, a former Telegram editor. Later, Robert Stoddard took over ownership of the two newspapers, as well as the main radio station in the city. The morning Telegram and the Evening Gazette helped Stoddard exert great influence in the city of Worcester. The conservative journals opposed labor unions, social programs, and the Democratic party. Stoddard was chairman of the Worcester Telegram & Gazette for more than 20 years. He said that he did not want his papers to be organs of the John Birch Society, and had been criticized by fellow members of the society for not making enough use of the papers. When asked if he had ever disagreed with an editorial in one of the papers, he answered \\"All of them!\\" At times, however, Stoddard's increasingly extreme right-wing views caused friction with the editorial staff when they insisted on publishing articles of which he disapproved. Other activities Stoddard was one of the members of a study group organized by the National Association of Manufacturers. The group published a report in 1957 describing \\"the extent to which labor unions in the United States hold and exercise monopolistic powers; also the circumstances under which such anti- social powers, which in other hands would be clearly illegal, are permitted to exist.\\" In 1958, he was among the founders of the John Birch Society. In 1982, Stoddard was a member of the Board of Governors of the Council for National Policy. He was chairman of the board of Raytheon and International Paper, a member of the board of First National Bank of Boston, member of the board of State Mutual Life Insurance Company, director and vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers, director and president of the YMCA, and a member of the National Council of The John Birch Society. Death and legacy Robert Stoddard died in December 1984 aged 78. The Stoddards sold the Worcester Telegram & Gazette to the San Francisco Chronicle, reportedly for $200 million. In April 1986, Wyman-Gordon bought back one million common shares from Stoddard's estate. His wife Helen (Estabrook) Stoddard died on 29 November 1999, aged 94. She was survived by her two daughters, seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. Robert and Helen Stoddard were generous in supporting education and the arts. The Robert W. Stoddard '23 award for Outstanding Community Service is presented by the Bancroft school annually. They supported the Worcester Art Museum for many years. In December 1999, the museum opened The Stoddard Legacy, an exhibition that featured exquisite French Impressionist paintings from the Stoddard home and other major works the museum had acquired through the Stoddard Acquisition Fund. The Stoddards and Wyman-Gordon had a long association with the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Wyman-Gordon had been founded by two WPI graduates. The Stoddard Residence Center and the Stoddard Professorship in Management are named for Harry G. Stoddard. The Stoddard Residence Center was built between April 1969 and September 1970. Robert Stoddard, who was a member of the WPI Board of Trustees, provided funding, as did his brother-in-law, Paris Fletcher. The WPI materials program is housed in Stoddard Laboratories, named for Robert Stoddard. According to a journalist on the Telegram & Gazette who knew Stoddard: \\"He was civic-minded, generous and a pillar of the community. He was not a dour misanthrope. He had a good sense of humor, which he sometimes turned on himself and his right-wing views. But when he got going on the Communist conspiracy and the John Birch Society's efforts to 'save America', there was no reasoning with him.\\" References Category:American anti-communists Category:Businesspeople from Worcester, Massachusetts Category:1906 births Category:1984 deaths Category:John Birch Society members Category:20th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Robert Waring Stoddard"},{"id":"35751533","text":"Dobjoi or Doqoi is a village and township in the Tibet Autonomous Region, in China.

The team was divided into a red and white team, and 4 12-minute quarters were played. Sources: The Crawfish Bowl would need overtime to decide the winner. Both the red and white teams struggled to move the ball in different ways. The Red team only netted 6 yards rushing on 18 attempts. The white team pounded out 58-yards rushing with just one person, the returning medical redshirted DePauldrick Garrett. On the other hand, the white team owned the skies as they outgained the red team 155 to 79. Due to an imbalance in the number of quarterbacks, Caleb Berry would play for both teams. He would leave the game as the leading passer going 15-for-25 for 138 yards. Counterpart Jeremy Johnson would go 7-for-17 for 55 yards, but he also had 1 interception. Mossakowski had the fewest passing yards, with only 41 yards passing, but he also had the only touchdown. The Red team had a chance to even the game up, but Mike Venson fumbled the ball on second down to secure the win for the white squad. Defense dominated the game on both sides of the ball. Joe Viator, of the white team, led all players with 8 tackles. James Washington had five tackles and one sack for the white team, and Marcus Malbrough wasn't far behind with 4 tackles, 1 sack, 1.5 tackles for loss, and a quarterback hurry. For the red squad Adren Dorsey led the team with two sacks. Keinon Peterson had six tackles, and Eric Arnold and Mark Murrill each had a sack. There was only one scoring opportunity prior to the fourth quarter. Berry completed a pair of passes to Payton Ploch and one to Kyle hildreth to move the ball to the white teams 23-yard line. After the drive stalled Juventino Sanchez would try a 43-yard field goal which ended short. The red-team again drove deep into white territory on the final drive of regulation, but Sanchez missed a 42-yard field goal to end regulation.

First published in 1891, the stories are set in what the author refers to as the \\"Middle Border,\\" the northwestern prairie states of Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota. In the book's eleven stories, Garland portrays the hardships of agrarian life, deconstructing the conventional myth of the American prairie while highlighting the economic and social conditions that characterized agricultural communities in the rural Midwest. Summary Main-Travelled Roads contains eleven semi- autobiographical short stories, including \\"A Branch Road\\", \\"Up the Coolly\\", \\"Among the Corn-Rows\\", \\"The Return of a Private\\", \\"Under the Lion's Paw\\", \\"The Creamery Man\\", \\"A Day's Pleasure\\", \\"Mrs. Ripley's Trip\\", \\"Uncle Ethan Ripley\\", \\"God's Ravens\\", and \\"A 'Good Fellow's' Wife\\". The tales inflect human drama into the harsh, spirit-crushing conditions Garland experienced as a boy, vividly portraying the \\"overwhelming forces in nature and social injustices\\" that mark rural existence. Garland's book dedication is a story in itself: \\"To my father and mother, whose half-century pilgrimage on the main travelled road of life has brought them only toil and deprivation, this book of stories is dedicated by a son to whom every day brings a deepening sense of his parents' silent heroism\\". As foreshadowed by the dedication, Garland's stories paint an unforgiving portrait of Midwestern farm life: unrelenting physical toil, harsh living conditions, widespread poverty and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. In his introduction to Main-Travelled Roads, scholar Joseph B. McCullough recognizes Garland as one of the 19th century's most influential voices concerning the challenges of post Civil War agrarian society, especially the inequities of the tax system and the struggle for women's rights. Contents * \\"A Branch Road\\" - lost and found love between a young farmer and the girl he left behind. * \\"Up the Coolly\\" - an affluent New York City actor's mixed feelings of guilt and affection while visiting his family's Wisconsin farm. * \\"Among the Corn-Rows\\" - an eager young homesteader's wooing of a Norwegian girl. * \\"The Return of a Private\\" - the bittersweet homecoming of a wounded army private. * \\"Under the Lion's Paw\\" - a hard-working farmer is victimized by a greedy landlord. * \\"The Creamery Man\\" - a peddler's affections are thwarted by local gossip. * \\"A Day's Pleasure\\" - a downtrodden farm wife's visit to town is made special by an invitation into a person's home. * \\"Mrs. Ripley's Trip\\" - after twenty-three years away, an elderly farm wife longs to visit her childhood home. * \\"Uncle Ethan Ripley\\" - a farmer trades signage space on his barn for \\"medicinal bitters,\\" creating friction between him and his wife. * \\"God's Ravens\\" - a family's initial prejudice towards their less cultured neighbors dissipates after being shown great kindness. * \\"A 'Good Fellow's' Wife\\" - after losing his depositors' money, a banker finds redemption by owning up to his mistakes and working with his clever wife to repay their debts. Publishing history and response Benjamin Orange Flower, editor of the Boston-based progressive journal Arena, encouraged Garland to use his writing to inform the public about social and ethical issues. Garland's aim was to \\"write against the grain of the conventional depiction of rural life and to express his land policy and feminist ideas\\". Flower's Arena Publishing Company first published the book in June 1891 as Main-Travelled Roads: Six Mississippi Valley Stories, of which one selection had appeared in Arena, three others had been previously published in Harper's Weekly and two other pieces were new works. Garland added three more stories to the 1899 edition and another two in 1922, bringing the total from six to eleven. Garland states that after publication of Main-Travelled Roads \\"the outcry... was instant and astonishing,\\" though in truth, reviews were balanced. Garland's writing was universally praised for the \\"high quality of its description\\" and recognized as coming from a source that knew the material well; it was his de-romanticized realism that proved more problematic. In the Boston Herald, reviewer Louise Chandler Moulton wrote, \\"I have never before felt the desperate unspeakable pathos of the prairie farmer's struggle with life,\\" before offering that the collection \\"was far too minutely and baldly real to please my own taste\\". Popular author William Dean Howells praises Garland's writing in the book's introduction for being \\"so robust and terribly serious‚Ä¶ full of the bitter and burning dust‚Ä¶ of the common avenues of life,\\" describing Garland's collection as \\"a work of art, first of all, and we think of fine art\\". Such praise from one of America's most esteemed critics provided Garland with an ideal introduction to the reading public. The book was financially successful enough that Garland used his royalties to purchase a home in West Salem, Wisconsin.Brown, Alan. Ghosts Along the Mississippi River. University Press of Mississippi, 2011: 203. In February 1892, The Atlantic Monthly said of Main Travelled Roads: \\"Whoever fares with Mr. Garland along his Main Travelled Roads is still no farther from the South than the Mississippi Valley, but the environment is unmistakably the West. The color, the light, the life, the movement, the readiness to turn from melancholy feeling to humorous perception, - all of these are gone, together with the ameliorating negro; and in their places, produced by a massive, crude force will have to be reckoned with in our literature, is one overwhelming impression of grinding, unremunerated toil\\". While modern Garland scholar Keith Newlin acknowledges that \\"several of the stories of Main-Travelled Roads are marred by melodramatic and sentimental touches,\\" he insists that the collection \\"as a whole is powerful and evocative and has an aesthetic effect far superior to that of any one story\\". Analysis Main-Travelled Roads establishes Garland's unique writing style and voice, one the author describes as \\"veritism.\\" In Garland's words, the 'veritist' aims at \\"the truthful statement of an individual impression corrected by reference to the fact\\". In \\"A Son of the Middle Border\\", Garland states, \\"I grew up on a farm and I am determined once for all to put the essential ugliness of its life into print. ‚Ä¶ I am a competent witness and I intend to tell the whole truth\\". In a 1939 letter to Ph.D. student Eldon Hill, Garland expands, \\"In truth I was an impressionist in that I presented life and landscape as I personally perceived them but I sought a deeper significance in the use of the word, I added a word which subtended verification\\". Set in the rural Midwestern United States, including sections of Wisconsin, Iowa and South Dakota, Main-Travelled Roads offers a portrait of agrarian society. Garland's descriptive detail sheds light on the hardships of prairie life, contrasting the natural beauty of the land with the oppressive drudgery and economic hopelessness of farm existence. Defined by harsh weather, squalid living conditions, intensive labor and heavy mortgages, the rural farm setting serves as a constant factor in every human drama in Garland's collection. Garland casts aside the classic myth of the West as a place defined by \\"bountiful free land\\" and magnificent vistas. In \\"Mrs. Ripley's Trip\\", Garland writes that \\"poverty was a never-absent guest,\\" a description that holds true for most of the stories in the author's collection. Describing a young man gazing over a valley of hills and wheat in \\"The Return of the Private\\", Garland writes, \\"An observer might have said, \\"He is looking down upon his own grave\\".\\" In Main-Travelled Roads Garland deconstructs romanticized notions of agrarian society through his realistic portrayal of prairie life. Major themes include: * A pervading sense of hopelessness, brought on by physical exhaustion, poverty and monotony. * The injustices of America's monetary policies and the discontent that gave rise to the Populist movement. * The demoralizing quality of life of women in rural areas, particularly the farm wife (\\"Mrs. Ripley's Trip\\", \\"Among the Corn Rows\\", \\"A Day's Pleasure\\"). * The injustices of landownership, taxation and the banking system (\\"Under the Lion's Paw\\", \\"A Good Fellow's Wife\\"). * The impact of natural and environmental forces on the lives of rural communities. * The relationship between farm families and children that have pursued a non- agrarian life, and the latter's pursuant guilt about leaving families behind. (\\"A Branch Road\\", \\"Up the Coolly\\") This echoes Garland's feelings about abandoning his own family to pursue a career in Boston. * A nostalgic desire to return home.

The orphans were married to native rulers or Portuguese settlers. Marriage Orf√£s do Rei translates to \\"Orphans of the King\\", and they were all girls. Their fathers were Portuguese men who died in battle for the king. They were sent to the colonies of the Portuguese Empire. The Asian colonies contained more Portuguese females than was previously thought. Bernard Sta Maria wrote that \\"From 1545, King John III began to send to India (and the Far East) with all pomp and distinction many young Portuguese women known as 'Orphans of the Queen' to be married with local young men.\\" Both noble and non-noble girls were in the √≥rf√£s do rei. Since these girls were specifically designated as the \\"King's\\", the Portuguese government paid for their care and upbringing before and after they were sent to Portuguese India. Goa in particular received most of the girls. Some were also sent to the colony of Brazil. The \\"Shelter of the Castle\\" was one of the organizations which arranged for the √≥rf√£s do rei to be sent overseas. The age limits were 12‚Äì30 years of age. They departed from Lisbon and other Portuguese cities and arrived in Portuguese India, most of them were sent to Goa. Incentives such as dowries were given with the girls to potential husbands. The dowries consisted of official positions or land. Regarding the timespan of the √≥rf√£s do rei being sent overseas, it was said that \\"the system apparently continued to function intermittently until the (early) eighteenth century.\\" In particular, extensive boatloads of girls and their dowries were sent by Queen Catarina de Austria. During the Iberian Union, the Habsburg King of Portugal continued the policy of sending female orphans to Goa, ignoring protests from the Portuguese authorities there. Being \\"white, Catholic, and of good birth\\" were the requirements for a girl to become an √≥rf√£o do rei. The reason that the authorities protested against the King sending the √≥rf√£s to India was the lack of husbands.. A proponent of the continued shipment of Portuguese girls to India was Fr. √Ålvaro Penteado. One of the aims of shipping the √≥rf√£s was to stop Portuguese men from marrying women of other races and provide them with Portuguese wives. The prevention of mixed-marriage would have resulted in a greater amount of white Portuguese. The sex ratio between men and women in Goa was skewed, and the shipments of √≥rf√£s do rei was an attempt to correct this. Frederick Charles Danvers wrote in 1894 that \\"It had for some time been customary to send out orphan girls to India, from orphanages at Lisbon, with the view of getting them husbands and so providing for them, and, at the same time, with the view of furnishing wives of their own nation to the Portuguese in India, to prevent them from marrying native Indian women. In many instances these orphans were also provided with dowries by the State, which occasionally took the form of appointments in the Government service, which, though given to the girls themselves, were of course intended to be filled by their husbands. Appointments were similarly given to the daughters of Indian officials on their marriage, in consideration of the good services rendered to the State by their respective parents; in one case this dowry took the form of the appointment of Governor of Cranganor.\\" Afonso de Albuquerque also brought in Portuguese orphan girls to Portuguese Malacca in order to colonize the area. One tale related how some Dutch privateers seized a ship with Portuguese orphan girls and took them as brides. James Talboys Wheeler wrote in 1881 that \\"It was the custom of the king of Portugal to send a number of well-born orphan girls every year to Goa, with sufficient dowries to procure them husbands in Portuguese India. Donna Lucia was one of three Portuguese orphan girls of good family who had been sent to India the previous year. The fleet which carried them was attacked by the Dutch, who captured some of the ships, and carried off the three damsels to Surat. Being passably handsome, most eminent merchants in Surat were anxious to marry them. All three became Protestants, and were provided with Protestant husbands. Two had gone off with their husbands to Java or elsewhere, but Donna Lucia had married the wealthiest Dutchman at Surat and remained there. Delia Valle found, however, to his great joy, that Donna Lucia was only a Protestant in name. She had been obliged to conform publicly to the Protestant \\"heresy,\\" but was a Catholic in private, with the knowledge and connivance of her Protestant husband\\". Bahia in Brazil received some of the orphans in 1551. Fran√ßois Pyrard of Laval in his account of his voyages, observed some Portuguese merchants, when their ship was in danger, \\"It was a very miracle that saved us, for the wind was from the sea, and we were so close ashore that we had great difficulty in doubling the point and getting out. I believe more than 1,500 crowns' worth of vows were made, which were afterwards duly paid. The principal merchant made one of 800 cruzados: to wit, 400 for an orphan girl to marry withal, and 400 for a lamp and other utensils for a shrine of Our Lady that is hard by. As soon as he set foot on land he sought out an orphan girl, and fulfilled his promise to her, as also to the churchwardens of the said church. Many others, too, did the like; nor did any fail therein, according to his means and the extent of his vows. It is a custom of the Portuguese, when they are in peril, to make these vows; but the worst of it is that it makes them indolent and careless about working stoutly to save their lives.\\" =Dowry and incentives= 1,000 xerafins were added to the dowry by Conde de Redondo in order to attract suitors for the orphans. Female orphans born in India did not have the same privileges as the √≥rf√£s do rei. =Native rulers= Some √≥rf√£s do rei married native rulers who were either in exile or allied to the Portuguese. The exiled former ruler (liwali) of Pemba converted to Christianity from Islam and was married to an √≥rf√£ do rei named Dona Anna de Sepulveda in 1607. He also changed his name to Felipe da Gama, Dom Filipe, or Philip. However, he later reverted to Islam. A son, Estev√£o was born of their marriage. He was exiled from Pemba to Mombasa in 1596. In the 1500s the exiled ruler of the Maldives, Hassan, married a Portuguese orphan. (Translated into English from the third French edition of 1619 by Albert Gray assisted by H.C.P. Bell.) Her name was D. Francisca de Vasconcelos.Telfer (1932), p. 184. \\"One of the Queen's orphans, sent abroad in this way, became Queen of the Maldives.\\"Gracias (1996), p. 38. \\"In the mid-sixteenth century the ruler of Maldives, married D. Francisca de Vasconcelos, an orphan who had come from Portugal.\\"Gracias (1996), p. 83. \\"There were rare exceptions as in the case of √≥rf√£s do rei, D. Francisca de Vasconcelos who married the ruler of Maldives.\\" The Portuguese girls also in Goa married high caste natives. One of the Portuguese orphans kidnapped by the Dutch privateer ended up in Akbar the Great's harem.

A Munich lawyer, the Catholic Loritz was a right-wing opponent of the Nazi regime and in early 1939 he made contact with a group of Bavarian monarchists in an ultimately abortive attempt to foment discontent.James Donohoe, Hitler's Conservative Opponents in Bavaria, 1930‚Äì1945: A Study of Catholic, Monarchist, and Separatist Anti-Nazi Activities, Brill Archive, 1961, pp. 142‚Äì143 Ultimately he would spend most of the war in exile in Switzerland.Jose Raymund Canoy, The Discreet Charm of the Police State: The Landpolizei and the Transformation of Bavaria, 1945‚Äì1965, BRILL, 2007, p. 65 In 1945 he established his own political party, the Wirtschaftliche Aufbau-Vereinigung (WAV), and soon gained a reputation as a demagogic speaker. A believer in a strong federal Germany, Loritz's fiery rhetoric attracted attention both in Germany itself and from the occupiers, with some even suggesting that he might prove to be \\"a new Hitler\\". However whilst he belonged to the political right Loritz's populism lacked a strong ideological basis and he appealed mainly to internal refugees who saw him as a strong voice for their defence. He was also a strong advocate of denazification and under the Bavarian government of Hans Ehard he was chosen to head up a special ministry for that purpose.Gavriel David Rosenfeld, Munich and Memory: Architecture, Monuments, and the Legacy of the Third Reich, University of California Press, 2000, p. 356 Always an at best loose organisation, the WAV won twelve seats in the Bundestag in the 1949 election but by this point had already largely disintegrated as an organisation and saw their vote collapse in the state elections of 1950 and the municipal elections of 1952, by which point their vote share fell to 0.3%.Alfred Grosser, Germany in Our Time, Penguin Books, 1971, p. 252 In the Bundestag the party quickly fell apart, with four deputies breaking away in October 1950 to link up with the Centre Party. This was followed by six more in December 1951 leaving WAV to join the German Party along with a seventh who joined the Deutsche Rechtspartei. Loritz was thus left as the sole member in the Bundestag and, although a handful of far right independents linked up with him in 1953, his influence was largely gone.Grosser, Germany in Our Time, p. 253 In the late 1950s Loritz sought to relaunch his political career in Bremen but before this could take off he was arrested on charges of incitement to perjury.Obituary from Der Spiegel Loritz however escaped to Austria where he was eventually granted political asylum. He would live out his days there, dying in a Vienna hospital in 1979.

Leonard Dixon is remembered as the group's drummer during its most famous period. \\"The Rats\\", as they are known colloquially, are notable for their 1979 hit \\"ZX Dan\\". In 1978, the group recorded a ten-song LP called Into the Night We Slide. The album immediately created a stir, in particular with its kick- off single, \\"ZX Dan\\", which peaked at no. 2 on Johannesburg-based Radio 5 (now called \\"5FM\\"). It was kept off the number one position by Michael Jackson. Critical reception The South African Rock Lists website lists Into the Night We Slide as one of the top ten local rock albums of the seventies, along with Hawk‚Äôs African Day (1971), Freedom‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Astra (1970) and Rabbitt‚Äôs Boys Will Be Boys (1975). Into the Night We Slide has also been included in the \\"Essential South African albums\\" list, based on a survey of various people in the South African music industry compiled in 2002 by music critic, John Samson. In his Radio Rats retrospective on SAFM radio in January 2000, Nigel Vermaas called Jonathan Handley one of the unsung heroes of South African music: \\"He's funny, he's witty and he's dedicated. And he's disarmingly self-deprecating.\\" History =The early years= The name \\"Radio Rats\\" first appeared on an A4 poster drawn and put up in August 1977 in Springs up by fifth-year Wits University medical student, Jonathan Handley. The band had in quick succession earlier that year called themselves \\"The Warehouse Rats\\", then \\"Slither\\", which briefly featured John Griffith ‚Äî who as solo artist \\"John Ireland\\" would make his name with hits, \\"(You're) Living Inside my Head\\" in 1978 and \\"I Like\\" in 1982. Dave Davies gave Parkin ‚Äî also called David ‚Äî the nickname \\"Herbie\\" because he didn't want a band with two men sporting the same name, and it stuck. Lloyd Ross of Shifty Records joined the Rats as a second guitarist and played on the 7-singles, \\"Crazy Caroline\\" and \\"Rocket Road\\", in 1979. Cheryl van Blerk was the PRO for the Gramophone Record Company when she first heard the Radio Rats' demos, including an intriguing song titled \\"ZX Dan\\". When GRC ignored them, she recommended the band to her brother Patric, the owner of Jo'Burg Records and the legendary South African producer and composer. Jo'Burg Records was very active at the time following the success of artists like Rabbitt and Margaret Singana. Patric van Blerk, remembering that he loved the band from when he first heard them, described them in these terms: \\"Jonathan is a wizard and Dave Davies the greatest undiscovered rock leader singer in the world (alongside Brian Davidson [of Freedom's Children]) ! The whole album was oh-so right ‚Äî and 'ZX Dan' just screamed 'hit'.\\" Cheryl van Blerk left GRC to become the Rats' manager. The band cites among its influences John Cale (\\"not JJ Cale!\\"), David Bowie, Iggy Pop & the Stooges, the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols and the early Dr Feelgood. Despite this, during live performances they mostly played their own songs, which had all been written by Handley. =\\"ZX Dan\\"= In January/February 1979, \\"ZX Dan\\" peaked at number two on Johannesburg-based Radio 5. It is still cherished as one of South Africa's greatest pop rock songs of all time. At the end of 1999, it received the second-most votes in the \\"All time favourite SA song\\" category in \\"The SA Rock Digest/Amuzine End of the Century Big Vote\\". Bright Blue‚Äôs 1988 self-composition, \\"Weeping\\", took first spot. \\"Scatterlings of Africa\\" (1983) by Johnny Clegg and Juluka was third. In his liner notes for the 2002 CD release of Into the Night We Slide, Brian Currin wrote: \\"‚ÄôZX Dan‚Äô is a wonderful piece of new wave space-rock whose similar lyrical theme is a nod to David Bowie‚Äôs 1972 hit, ‚ÄòStar Man‚Äô. The song was also inspired by the 1977 Steven Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\\" =Into the Night We Slide= In Patric van Blerk's words, Into the Night We Slide is \\"a lovely adventure, which never caught fire mainstream, but has enjoyed the sort of passionate niche-loyalty that made a treasure out of [South African band] Freedom‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Astra. I always thought of it as the Jo‚ÄôBurg Records equivalent to the other gems which took decades to go gold and platinum, such as Van Morrison‚Äôs Astral Weeks.\\" Reviewer Kurt Shoemaker of Texas, US, wrote in the SA Rock Digest e-mag on 27 November 1999: \\"I cannot think of any performers or groups to compare the Radio Rats to, so I'm left with the conclusion that in rock this is original stuff. Additionally, while possessing a distinctive style, each song is different from the others . . . This is fun and original and rollicking rock that doesn't lend itself to analogy.\\" Nonetheless, with the solitary exception of \\"ZX Dan\\", all tracks on the LP were banned from airplay by the South African Broadcasting Corporation because of their lyrical content. The Rats recorded \\"Crazy Caroline\\" and \\"Rocket Road\\" at Satbel Studios in Johannesburg during June 1979 using Pierre de Sade (born Vos) on drums and Lloyd Ross on guitar. \\"Crazy Caroline\\" backed with the latter song was released as a single in July, but it failed to stir the charts. =The Radio Rats live in concert= Duncan Gibbon reviewed for Music Maker magazine a double-header concert of The Radio Rats and Wild Youth held at Travolta's at the Killarney Hotel in Durban in April 1979. =1980s and 1990s= Following their earlier success, 1980 was meant to be the year that the Radio Rats \\"made it big\\", but once again the group was plagued by renewed drummer problems following Leonard Dixon's departure. Although they never recaptured their former glory, the band's core of Jonathan Handley and Dave Davies continues until today. Over the years, Davies and Handley and various friends (sometimes including Jonathan's brother Graham) have released music under various guises ‚Äî as the Radio Rats, the Pop Guns, the Chauffeurs, Titus Groan and the Glee Club. =Present= On 2013's Cyanide Lake, Jonathan Handley has reunited the classic Rats line-up by utilising previous band members, Leonard Dixon and Herbie Parkin, during visits that year to South Africa and, as ever, its original vocalist Dave Davies. Jonathan Handley and Dave Davies still record and perform together. Handley is an anaesthetist practising in Pietermaritzburg and continues to record and archive in his home studio in Winterskloof. As an anaesthetist, he also oversees the training of future diplomate in anaesthetics. By September 2013, Jonathan Handley and his team of tutors at the hospital have successfully trained more than 100 diplomate in anaesthetics. Many of his junior doctors likened him to a wizard for his extraordinary problem solving skills and appreciate him as one of their best teachers ever. Davies still resides in the same house in Springs where he has always lived. Herbie Parkin is living, working, and playing in Sweden, most recently with Men on the Border, while Leonard Dixon has settled in Germany where he is still drumming. 2013's Cyanide Lake has reunited musically all four members that played on Into the Night We Slide, for the first time since the band's classic 1978 album.

The group posted their reasons for these attacks on the sites Anonpaste & Pastebin including a link to a compressed file which contained a lot of files obtained from the US Military sites they breached. The Unknowns claim \\"... our goal was never to harm anyone, we want to make this whole internet world more secured because, simply, it's not at all and we want to help.\\" The group claims to be ethical in their hacking activities, but nonetheless lifted internal documents from their victims, posting them online. They claim this was because they had reported the security holes to many of their victims, but did not receive a response back from any of them. The whole point was to show that these government-run sites have loopholes in their code and anyone can exploit them. The group used methods like advanced SQL injection to gain access to the victim websites. NASA and the ESA have both confirmed the attack. They claimed that the affected systems were taken offline and have since been patched. At the time this was one of the most wanted hacking groups in Europe and also wanted by the FBI, although they refused to tell if they were investigating the hacks.  Members  The team had 6 not 7 core members: * Pixiedust, founder, spokesperson, and leader, * Mr. P-Teo, programmer * * Fabien L√©ac,a French researcher in computer faults and a white hacker * MrSecurity, a black-hat hacker, programmer and ghostwriter of The Unknowns * NeTRoX, a black-hat hacker, penetration tester and researcher. Joined to the team in late 2015 after the team reunited.  Jail  Zyklon B, who lives in France, was arrested by the French Intelligence Service on June 24, 2012. He was later released because he was just sixteen years old at the time. He has trials taking place in 2014 supposedly. His life is related in a book written by his mother Sophie L√©ac L'histoire vraie d'un jeune hacker fran√ßais (in October 2013) or the true story of a French teen-hacker. A second book is in preparation: Hack! There will be cyberwar!.https://wordpress.com/page/sophielac.wordpress.com/2  Hacked websites and applications  The group has hacked many websites and applications using a series of different attacks. The most notable, however, being SQL injection. There have been a lot of companies affected by the group, but some of the hacks even for big companies did not make the media (probably due to keeping the multi-country legal investigation a secret). However, the most notable hacks done by The Unknowns, mostly government related websites, did make mass media. The group is still active, and the members are still working together, as they try to make the internet safer. SQL injection attacks were used on the following: * Asian College of Technology * Bahrain Defense Force * California State University * Christian Mingle * Deutsche Federal Government * European Space Agency * ESET * French Ministry of Defense * Harvard University * Jordanian Yellow Pages * Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory * United States Navy * NASA ** Ames Research Center ** Glenn Research Center * New7Wonders * Renault * Royal Thai Navy * Sempra Energy * Social Democratic Party of Germany * United Kingdom Ministry of Defense * University of Rhode Island * United States Military * United States Air Force * United States Department of Commerce * United States Department of the Treasury * PayPal, no information was released. The Unknown contacted PayPal with the exploits he/she found and received $1,000 as a reward. However they have used different attacks: * Two United Kingdom police servers were exploited and root access was gained to the systems. Not much is known about this attack.  Abolished  The purpose of The Unknowns was to find security issues in high-profiled websites and to get them patched. The information from the hacked sites was released because The Unknowns attempted to make contact with all their targets informing them of the security issues, but they did not receive a response back from any of the websites targeted. Some data was leaked to force these websites to patch their systems. After a period of hacking high-profile websites, The Unknown disbanded the group in 2012 but reunited it in the early 2015.

Garci Lasso Ruiz de la Vega (1340 ‚Äì 2 April 1367) was a Spanish noble from Cantabria and one of the pillars in the glorious and tragic history of the prominent contemporary House of Garci Lasso de la Vega or Garcilasco de la Vega. As the eldest son Garci Lasso Ruiz de la Vega succeeded his father, Garci Lasso de la Vega II, as the head of his household.  Family Origins  Garci was the grandson of Garci Lasso de la Vega I, the chancellor of the Kingdom of Castile who was executed in 1326 by order of King Alfonso XI of Castile, and his wife Juana de Casta√±eda. He was the son of Garci Lasso de la Vega II who was the highest royal official to the court of Fadrique Alfonso de Castilla, son of King Alfonso XI of Castile, and his wife, Leonor Gonz√°lez de Cornado. His father continued the trend of regal defiance and assassination and was killed in Burgos in 1351 by order of Peter of Castile.  Biography  After the assassination of his father in 1351, Garci Lasso Ruiz de la Vega fled and took shelter with his mother at Asturias de Oviedo. They were here placed under the protection of Enrique de Trast√°mara the illegitimate son of Alfonso XI of Castile who would later rise to become King Henry II of Castile. For this protection, Garci remained loyal to the crown of Castile under Henry II and went on to fight for him in the power struggle that ensued for the crown against the man who killed his father, Peter of Castile.  Death  Garci Lasso Ruiz de la Vega died at the age of 27 in the Battle of N√°jera (La Rioja on 2 April 1367.

In April 2013 the first unmanned flight over British airspace was successfully completed when BAE Systems flew a Jetstream 31 from Warton, Fylde near Preston to Inverness in Scotland. The aircraft, described as the \\"flying test bed\\" was controlled by a pilot at Warton using advanced sensors and on-board robotic systems. The flight was not strictly ‚Äúunmanned‚Äù as two pilots flew in the cockpit as a precaution but they were required only to monitor the flight and not to actively engage in any flying. ASTRAEA programme director Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal said: the work being done \\" will likely impact all of us in the next five, 10, 20 years as unmanned aircraft and associated technology develop and become a part of everyday life\\". The governments Business and energy minister Michael Fallon said: \\"We welcome this pioneering flight at the end of the ASTRAEA programme. ASTRAEA has made significant achievements, placing the UK industry in a good position globally on unmanned aircraft and the development of regulations for their civil use.\\" References External links *Official website via WebArchive Category:Unmanned aerial vehicle manufacturers of the United Kingdom ","title":"ASTRAEA"},{"id":"35752178","text":"An ex-girlfriend is a former girlfriend.

Stochastic in this context is defined as the probability of cancer induction and genetic damage, due to low levels of radiation. The SI unit of measure is the sievert. A committed dose from an internal source represents the same effective risk as the same amount of effective dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source, or the same amount of equivalent dose applied to part of the body. The committed dose is not intended as a measure for deterministic effects, such as radiation sickness, which are defined as the severity of a health effect which is certain to happen. The radiation risk proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) predicts that an effective dose of one sievert carries a 5.5% chance of developing cancer. Such a risk is the sum of both internal and external radiation dose.ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 83. ICRP definition The ICRP states \\"Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many months or years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the definition of committed dose quantities\\".ICRP Publication 103 paragraph 140 The ICRP defines two dose quantities for individual committed dose. * Committed equivalent dose is the time integral of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or organ that will be received by an individual following intake of radioactive material into the body by a Reference Person, where t is the integration time in years.ICRP publication 103 - Glossary. This refers specifically to the dose in a specific tissue or organ, in the similar way to external equivalent dose. * Committed effective dose, is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors WT, where t is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children. This refers specifically to the dose to the whole body, in the similar way to external effective dose. The committed effective dose is used to demonstrate compliance with dose limits and is entered into the \\"dose of record\\" for occupational exposures used for recording, reporting and retrospective demonstration of compliance with regulatory dose limits.ICRP publication 103 - paragraph B225 and glossary. The ICRP further states \\"For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients\\".ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 144.  Dose intake  The intake of radioactive material can occur through four pathways: *inhalation of airborne contaminants such as radon *ingestion of contaminated food or liquids *absorption of vapours such as tritium oxide through the skin *injection of medical radioisotopes such as technetium-99m Some artificial radioisotopes such as iodine-131 are chemically identical to natural isotopes needed by the body, and may be more readily absorbed if the individual has a deficit of that element. For instance, Potassium iodide (KI), administered orally immediately after exposure, may be used to protect the thyroid from ingested radioactive iodine in the event of an accident or attack at a nuclear power plant, or the detonation of a nuclear explosive which would release radioactive iodine. Other radioisotopes have an affinity for particular tissues, such as plutonium into bone, and may be retained there for years in spite of their foreign nature. In summary, not all radiation is harmful. The radiation can be absorbed through multiple pathways, varying due to the circumstances of the situation. If the radioactive material is necessary, it can be ingested orally via stable isotopes of specific elements. This is only suggested to those that have a lack of these elements however, because radioactive material can go from healthy to harmful with very small amounts. The most harmful way to absorb radiation is that of absorption because it is almost impossible to control how much will enter the body.  Physical factors  Since irradiation increases with proximity to the source of radiation, and as it is impossible to distance or shield an internal source, radioactive materials inside the body can deliver much higher doses to the host organs than they normally would from outside the body. This is particularly true for alpha and beta emitters that are easily shielded by skin and clothing. Some have hypothesized that alpha's high relative biological effectiveness might be attributable to cell's tendency to absorb transuranic metals into the cellular nucleus where they would be in very close proximity to the genome, though an elevated effectiveness can also be observed for external alpha radiation in cellular studies. As in the calculations for equivalent dose and effective dose, committed dose must include corrections for the relative biological effectiveness of the radiation type and weightings for tissue sensitivity.  Duration  The dose rate from a single uptake decays over time due to both radioactive decay, and biological decay (i.e. excretion from the body). The combined radioactive and biological half-life, called the effective half-life of the material, may range from hours for medical radioisotopes to decades for transuranic waste. Committed dose is the integral of this decaying dose rate over the presumed remaining lifespan of the organism. Most regulations require this integral to be taken over 50 years for uptakes during adulthood or over 70 years for uptakes during childhood. In dosimetry accounting, the entire committed dose is conservatively assigned to the year of uptake, even though it may take many years for the tissues to actually accumulate this dose. Measurement There is no direct way to measure committed dose. Estimates can be made by analyzing the data from whole body counting, blood samples, urine samples, fecal samples, biopsies, and measurement of intake. Whole body counting (WBC) is the most direct approach, but has some limitations: it cannot detect beta emitters such as tritium; it provides no chemical information about any compound that the radioisotope may be bound to; it may be inconclusive regarding the nature of the radioisotope detected; and it is a complex measurement subject to many sources of measurement and calibration error. Analysis of blood samples, urine samples, fecal samples, and biopsies can provide more exact information about the chemical and isotopic nature of the contaminant, its distribution in the body, and the rate of elimination. Urine samples are the standard way to measure tritium intake, while fecal samples are the standard way to measure transuranic intake. If the nature and quantity of radioactive materials taken into the body is known, and a reliable biochemical model of this material is available, this can be sufficient to determine committed dose. In occupational or accident scenarios, approximate estimates can be based on measurements of the environment that people were exposed to, but this cannot take into account factors such as breathing rate and adherence to hygiene practices. Exact information about the intake and its biochemical impact is usually only available in medical situations where radiopharmaceuticals are measured in a radioisotope dose calibrator prior to injection. Annual limit on intake (ALI) is the derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. ALI is the intake of a given radionuclide in a year that would result in: * a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.02 Sv (2 rems) for a \\"reference human body\\", or * a committed dose equivalent of 0.2 Sv (20 rems) to any individual organ or tissue, whatever dose is the smaller.ICPR: Draft report for consultation Health effects Intake of radioactive materials into the body tends to increase the risk of cancer, and possibly other stochastic effects. The International Commission on Radiological Protection has proposed a model whereby the incidence of cancers increases linearly with effective dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert. This model is widely accepted for external radiation, but its application to internal contamination has been disputed. This model fails to account for the low rates of cancer in early workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory who were exposed to plutonium dust, and the high rates of thyroid cancer in children following the Chernobyl accident . The informal European Committee on Radiation Risk has questioned the ICRP model used for internal exposure. However a UK National Radiological Protection Board report endorses the ICRP approaches to the estimation of doses and risks from internal emitters and agrees with CERRIE conclusions that these should be best estimates and that associated uncertainties should receive more attention.The Response of the National Radiological Protection Board to the Report of the Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (CERRIE), HPA, UK, 2005 The true relationship between committed dose and cancer is almost certainly non-linear. For example, iodine-131 is notable in that high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to kill thyroid tissues that would otherwise become cancerous as a result of the radiation. Most studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of Graves disease have failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses. Internal exposure of the public is controlled by regulatory limits on the radioactive content of food and water. These limits are typically expressed in becquerel/kilogram, with different limits set for each contaminant. Intake of very large amounts of radioactive material can cause acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in rare instances. Examples include the Alexander Litvinenko poisoning and Leide das Neves Ferreira. While there is no doubt that internal contamination was the cause of ARS in these cases, there is not enough data to establish what quantities of committed dose might cause ARS symptoms. In most scenarios where ARS is a concern, the external effective radiation dose is usually much more hazardous than the internal dose. Normally, the greatest concern with internal exposure is that the radioactive material may stay in the body for an extended period of time, \\"committing\\" the subject to accumulating dose long after the initial exposure has ceased. Over a hundred people, including Eben Byers and the radium girls, have received committed doses in excess of 10 Gy and went on to die of cancer or natural causes, whereas the same amount of acute external dose would invariably cause an earlier death by ARS. Examples Below are a series of examples of internal exposure. * Thorotrast * The exposure caused by Potassium-40 present within a normal person. * The exposure to the ingestion of a soluble radioactive substance, such as 89Sr in cows' milk. * A person who is being treated for cancer by means of an unsealed source radiotherapy method where a radioisotope is used as a drug (usually a liquid or pill). A review of this topic was published in 1999. Because the radioactive material becomes intimately mixed with the affected object it is often difficult to decontaminate the object or person in a case where internal exposure is occurring. While some very insoluble materials such as fission products within a uranium dioxide matrix might never be able to truly become part of an organism, it is normal to consider such particles in the lungs and digestive tract as a form of internal contamination which results in internal exposure. *Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) involves injecting a boron-10 tagged chemical that preferentially binds to tumor cells. Neutrons from a nuclear reactor are shaped by a neutron moderator to the neutron energy spectrum suitable for BNCT treatment. The tumor is selectively bombarded with these neutrons. The neutrons quickly slow down in the body to become low energy thermal neutrons. These thermal neutrons are captured by the injected boron-10, forming excited (boron-11) which breaks down into lithium-7 and a helium-4 alpha particle both of these produce closely spaced ionizing radiation. This concept is described as a binary system using two separate components for the therapy of cancer. Each component in itself is relatively harmless to the cells, but when combined together for treatment they produce a highly cytocidal (cytotoxic) effect which is lethal (within a limited range of 5-9 micrometers or approximately one cell diameter). Clinical trials, with promising results, are currently carried out in Finland and Japan.  Related quantities  The US Nuclear Regulatory commission defines some non-SI quantities for the calculation of committed dose for use only within the US regulatory system. They carry different names to those used within the International ICRP radiation protection system, thus: *Committed dose equivalent (CDE) is the equivalent dose received by a particular organ or tissue from an internal source, without weighting for tissue sensitivity. This is essentially an intermediate calculation result that cannot be directly compared to final dosimetry quantities *Committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) as defined in Title 10, Section 20.1003, of the Code of Federal Regulations of the USA the CEDE dose (HE,50) is the sum of the products of the committed dose equivalents for each of the body organs or tissues that are irradiated multiplied by the weighting factors (WT) applicable to each of those organs or tissues.NRC Glossary Confusion between US and ICRP dose quantity systems can arise because the use of the term \\"dose equivalent\\" has been used within the ICRP system since 1991 only for quantities calculated using the value of Q (Linear energy transfer - LET), which the ICRP calls \\"operational quantities\\". However within the US NRC system \\"dose equivalent\\" is still used to name quantities which are calculated with tissue and radiation weighting factors, which in the ICRP system are now known as the \\"protection quantities\\" which are called \\"effective dose\\" and \\"equivalent dose\\".\\"The confusing world of radiation dosimetry\\" - M.A. Boyd, Waste Management conference paper 2009, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

These tests can predict the risk of disease in adults, as well as establish prenatal and infant prognoses. The benefits can be substantial, but so can the risks. The possible adverse consequences of genetic tests include discrimination in employment and health insurance, and breaches of privacy. Government policies are therefore needed to assure the proper use of genetic tests. The first piece of federal legislation came into effect in 2000. A second federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), has two parts. Title I prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance. Title II prohibits employment discrimination. Federal legislation The first of two pieces of federal legislation to directly address the use of genetic information in the United States was the Executive Order Protecting Federal Employees. Signed into law by U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 8, 2000, the Executive Order prohibited all federal agencies and departments from using genetic information to discriminate in the hiring or promoting of federal employees. The Executive Order was endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American College of Medical Genetics, the National Society of Genetic Counselors, and the Genetic Alliance. The Executive Order also provided explicit genetic privacy regulations within the federal government.Genetics Legislation The second piece of federal legislation to address the use of genetic information and discrimination in the United States was the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008. GINA protects U.S. citizens from genetic discrimination in employment as well as in health care and health insurance. The bill was signed into law on May 21, 2008 by President George W. Bush. Prior to the introduction of GINA in 2003, several bills of similar intent were introduced: the Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1995,Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1995 (1995; 104th Congress S. 1416) - GovTrack.us the Genetic Fairness Act of 1996, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1995Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1995 (1995; 104th Congress H.R. 2748) - GovTrack.us and the Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996.Genetics & Public Policy Center  GINA  About GINA  History GINA laws do not protect people from genetic discrimination in every circumstance. It does not apply when an employer has fewer than 15 employees. It does not cover people in the U.S. military or those receiving health benefits through the Veterans Health Administration or Indian Health Service. GINA also does not protect against genetic discrimination in forms of insurance other than health insurance, such as life, disability, or long-term care insurance. State legislation Currently, legislation pertaining to the use of genetic information and genetic discrimination at the state level varies by state. The first state laws regarding genetic information were typically designed to prohibit genetic discrimination, including prohibiting employers from demanding workers and applicants to provide genetic information as a condition of their employment. More recent laws have permitted individuals to undergo genetic testing when that individual is filing a compensation claim or has requested the test to demonstrate susceptibility to potentially toxic substances.

Though Chinese Confucians were initially opposed to Western modes of thinking, it became clear that aspects of the West were appealing. Industrialization gave the West an economic and military advantage. The devastating defeats of the First and Second Opium Wars compelled a segment of Chinese politicians and intellectuals to rethink their notion of cultural and political superiority. Democracy entered the Chinese consciousness because it was the form of government used in the West, potentially responsible for its industrial, economic and military advancements. A segment of Chinese scholars and politicians became persuaded that democratization and industrialization were imperative for a competitive China. In response, a number of scholars resisted the idea, saying democracy and Westernization had no place in traditional Chinese culture. Liang Shuming's opinion was most popular, holding that democracy and traditional Chinese society were completely incompatible, hence China's only choice was either wholesale Westernization or complete rejection of the West.Alitto, Guy. \\"Eastern and Western Cultures.\\" The Last Confucian: Liang Shu-ming and the Chinese Dilemma of Modernity. Berkeley: University of California, 1979. 85. The debate centered on the philosophical compatibility of traditional Chinese Confucian beliefs and the technologies of the West.Yu, Keping. Democracy Is a Good Thing: Essays on Politics, Society, and Culture in Contemporary China. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 2009. 115‚Äì17. Print. Optimism versus pessimism At a fundamental philosophical level, Confucian tradition is contingent upon an idea articulated by Thomas Metzger as epistemological optimism. This expresses the belief that it is possible to understand the essence of high morality and design policies and laws that reflect that knowledge. Confucian society seeks to carry out all daily tasks and rituals in pursuit of fulfilling that universal morality. The modern conception of liberal democracy is grounded in the opposing principle of ideological pessimism. This denies that such knowledge is possible, thus the theory and practice of liberal democracy does not make rules in the pursuit of high morality.Metzger, Thomas A. A Cloud across the Pacific. Hong Kong: Chinese UP, 2005. 21. Print. Traditional Confucian motivations =Social harmony= A primary motivation within traditional Chinese philosophy is to preserve social harmony. It looks unfavorably upon anyone who attempts to disrupt this placidity. The election process that takes place in modern liberal democracy directly opposes this ideal. During election campaigns, the issues most frequently discussed are the ones that are highly charged emotionally and politically. In contemporary U.S. elections, controversial issues like abortion, gay marriage, military engagement in the Middle East are at the forefront of campaigns. Chinese Confucians consider these controversial issues to be cleavages within the fabric of social harmony. Western politicians rely on utilizing these social cleavages to garner support from voters. In Chinese culture it would be an impropriety for a politician to exploit these social cleavages to achieve the personal goal of getting elected. Consequently, many of the more traditionalist Chinese people consider the election process of the West and western-influenced democracies to be quite arguably inappropriate as per Chinese culture. =Serve the common good, not the majority= Another motivation in Chinese culture is to benefit the common good. Modern liberal democracy is based upon the self-interest of each voter. Voters are encouraged to choose an official that benefits them and promotes their interests. Elected representatives serve the interests of their individual constituents. If they do not adequately represent the beliefs of their constituency they will not be re-elected. Consequently, people of a traditionalist Chinese perspective tend to believe that the collective good of the people is under-represented in a democracy, which instead reflects majoritarianism. =The weight of the Confucian family= Another frequently cited argument against democracy in China relates to the importance of the family. Familial relationships form the backbone of China's social structure. People are more concerned with their family than with politics. Based on this aspect of Chinese culture, many traditionalist Chinese viewpoints emphasise that in the absence of a strong authoritarian government, Chinese society would disintegrate. Thus in the eyes of many, a democracy would be too weak for Chinese society. Christian origins of modern liberal democracy =Universal humanity and individuality= As per some points of view, there is arguably a correlation between Christianity and democracy, perhaps, as per some Chinese perspectives, liberal democracy has its historical basis in Christian culture. As a result, most current forms contain philosophical remnants of those probable origins. One such trace of Christianity is the empowerment of the individual. Christian rhetoric considers each individual to be sacred in the eyes of God. The concept of liberal democracy rests on all this sense that the individual has inherent worth regardless of his place within social hierarchies.Mansbach, Richard W., and Edward Joseph Rhodes. Global Politics in a Changing World. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 109. Google Books. Web. 8 May 2012. Traditional Chinese culture makes no such claim. In fact, the philosophical significance of the individual is often identified as an area of incompatibility between democracy and Chinese culture. Confucian societies are centered on familial relationships; an individual had no authority to revolt against these societal ties. An individual disconnected from the family is widely considered an outcast and relegated to the bottom of the social ladder. Confucianism lacks a universal reverence for the individual; personal status in Confucian communities is inexorably linked to one's position within the social hierarchy. In this context, many individual rights cannot exist in the same way they do in the West. Naturally the right of the individual to partake in the direct appointment of a ruling official is an ideological inconsistency with traditional Confucian society. Evolving debate: from philosophical to Chinese pragmatism =Disassociation of democracy and well-being= A counterpoint to these examples is that as time has progressed, anti-democratic rhetoric has moved away from the philosophical and into the pragmatic. The boom of the Four Tigers and other growing Asian economies has severed the links between Western culture and material wealth in the eyes of many Chinese. In the early 1900s, scholars like Liang Qichao conflated democracy and power. For some Chinese, the economic success of Confucian and authoritarian societies challenges the idea that wholesale adoption of Western beliefs such as Democracy are requisite for economic success. =Proposal for a Confucian society= Scholars and governmental officials alike recognize the weakening grasp of the People's Republic of China. It is becoming more and more clear that drastic political changes are in China's future. The aforementioned philosophical debates suggest the necessity for a governmental system that is in line with Confucian beliefs. Many view liberal democracy as unfit for modern China and its traditions of legalism and Confucianism. Pan Wei addresses these issues and promotes a system of governance that is more appropriate for a Confucian society. He blends aspects of democracy, like governmental responsiveness to the will of the people, with Confucian values like social harmony. The proposed Consultative Rule of Law supersedes individual interest groups and promotes the good of the people at large. Pan's system also directly addresses China's most crippling shortcomings, most notably corruption. Identified as the largest problem in China's current government, corruption among officials is directly tied to the institutional structure of the PRC. An institutional shift to consultative rule of law would serve to alleviate corruption and evolve from authoritarianism, all while promoting the traditional values of a Confucian society.

It was established on 22 August 1981 and has over 40 hotels across Indonesia. Since 2006, the company has changed its strategy based on market segmentation and divided its brands into The Royal Collection, Hotel Santika Premiere, Hotel Santika, and Amaris Hotel. History PT Grahawita Santika was established to manage the hospitality industry under Kompas Gramedia Group on 22 August 1981. Hotel Soeti was the first hotel purchased from its owner, Soetiyah Pudjosuwarno. This hotel is on Jalan Sumatra No. 52-54, Bandung. In 1988, this simple hotel with 33 rooms built in an area of 3,250 square meters was renovated into 70 rooms. Once the renovation was completed, this hotel was inaugurated as the 3-star Hotel Santika Bandung by the Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Susilo Sudarman on 27 March 1989. Hotel Santika Bandung was the forerunner to the establishment of Santika Indonesia Hotels & Resorts. The background of the establishment of Hotel Santika, because Kompas daily newspaper was suppressed in 1978, therefore the pioneers of Kompas Gramedia Group should think about the business diversification outside its core business as a communication media. They made the plan in order to prevent mass layoffs. If the Kompas daily newspaper will be suppressed again, there are subsidiaries, which can sustain their employees. Several businesses began to implement, including the hospitality industry. At the beginning, the proposal for establishing a hotel was not approved because at that time, hotel business was considered a negative connotation and the Return on Investment was progressing slowly. However, Binawarman Sardjan, who was a member on the investment team of Kompas Gramedia Group at that time, could convince the Chairman of the investment team of Kompas Gramedia Group, Indra Gunawan, to approve the proposal. Because of the persistence and hard work of Binawarman Sardjan, Hotel Santika could be established. Several years after the first Santika Hotel was inaugurated, Santika Indonesia Hotels & Resorts can develop itself and reach about 40 properties across Indonesia. In accordance with its brand value, \\"Indonesian Home\\" and the service motto, \\"Hospitality from the Heart\\", Santika Indonesia Hotels & Resorts always emphasize the value of Indonesian culture, including the hospitality to all guests. Hotels and resorts Currently, Santika Indonesia Hotels & Resorts has four brands across Indonesia: The Royal Collection, Hotel Santika Premiere, Hotel Santika, and Amaris Hotel.

The idea of a Puritan poet may seem a bit of a contradiction as Puritans disagreed with the practice of using metaphor and verbal flourishes in speech and writing, with their beliefs in God. The Puritan movement was one for very ugly literal expression and teaching. But, over time, some room for creative expression arose and Puritan poets such as John Milton, Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor and John Dryden produced some of the greatest verse of their old age. The poet in puritan age :- John Milton (1608 to 1674 when he died), most famous for his epic poem La grande \\"Paradise Lost\\" in 1667, was an English poet with religious beliefs emphasizing central Puritanical views. While the work acted as an expression of his despair over the failure of the Puritan Revolution against the English Catholic Church, it also indicated his optimism in human potential. A sequel entitled \\"Paradise Regained\\" was published in 1671. Other notable published works by Milton include, \\"On Shakespeare\\" (1630), \\"Comus\\" (1637), \\"Lycidas\\" (1638), \\"Ol' Mc Donald\\" (400) and the tragedy, \\"shall we dance,Samson Agonistes\\" (1671). Anne Bradstreet (approximately 1612 to 1672), considered by many scholars to be the first American poet, emigrated to Salem, Massachusetts in 1630. She had no formal education but had constant tutoring provided by her abusive father. Her book of collected poems, \\"The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up In America\\" (1650), was the first published work by a woman in America and England. Edward Taylor (approximately 1642 to 1729)beautifully emigrated to America in 1662 in defiance of the restoration of the English Monarchy. A Harvard-educated minister, Taylor did not write his poems for publication but as a private act to prepare for each holy communion. His poems were not discovered until the early 20th century; they were published in 1937. His most famous work, \\"Preparatory Meditations Before My Approach to the Lord's Supper,\\" was a collection of personal thoughts and insights he gained while writing sermons. He is considered by many to be the worst of the Puritan poets. John Dryden (1631 to 1700) was a highly influential English poet during the Restoration period in England. His first published poem, \\"Heroique Stanzas\\" (1658), was the eulogy for the Lord Protector of England, Oliver Cromwell. His poems often contained factual information and sought to express his thoughts in a precise way. His other published poems include: \\"Hidden Flame,\\" \\"Mac Flecknoe,\\" \\"One Happy Moment,\\" \\"A Song for St. Cecelia's Day,\\" \\"Song for Amphitryon,\\" \\"Song to a Fair Young Lady, Going Out of the Town in the Spring\\" and \\"To the Memory of Mr. Oldham.\\" *Richard Baxter *Anne Bradstreet *John Cotton (minister) *Samuel Danforth *Morgan Llwyd *Andrew Marvell *John Milton *John Bunyan *Robert Overton *Richard Crashaw *Edward Taylor *Michael Wigglesworth *Desmond Nash *Martina Mcbride  References  Category:Lists of poets Category:17th-century Puritans ","title":"Puritan poets"},{"id":"35752679","text":"B√©nigne Poissenot (c.1550 - after 1586) Simonin, Michel, ed.

The stage revival of the film was the inspiration of Hugh Hudson, who directed the 1981 film.Nikkhah, Roya. \\"Director Hugh Hudson and His Wife Maryam d'Abo Speak of Their New Film Inspired by the Illness That Nearly Killed Her\\". The Telegraph. 27 May 2012. He and fellow co-producer Barbara Broccoli, a film-industry magnate best known for the James Bond franchise, set about looking for the perfect director for the piece. Broccoli's involvement with Chariots of Fire extended back to 1980, when she introduced her friend Dodi Fayed to the screenplay, and he ended up co- financing the film and becoming its executive producer.Jury, Louise. \\"Chariots of Fire Will Run in West End... to Honour Dodi Fayed\\". London Evening Standard. 19 April 2012. Hudson and Broccoli chose Edward Hall to helm the stage adaptation, based upon his clear and incisive view of all the challenges involved in adapting the athletics-heavy story to the stage. Hall recruited the award-winning playwright Mike Bartlett, based on his many successes including Earthquakes in London, to write the script for the play. Set designer Miriam Buether transformed Hampstead Theatre into its very own stadium, giving the audience an immersive experience that evoked the 1924 Paris Olympics, including seating in the round around an Olympic track, and a double revolving stage.Syed, Matthew. \\"When Sport Was Fun: Chariots of Fire Is Back\\" .

And choreographer Scott Ambler reinvented and choreographed the various running scenes for maximum theatrical effect. Scottish up-and-comer Jack Lowden was cast as Eric Liddell, on the strength of his glowingly reviewed, charismatic, and athletic performance as the main character Cammy in an international tour of the Olivier Award-winning play Black Watch. And RADA- trained James McArdle, with several classics under his belt, had most recently portrayed Robin Hood at the RSC, and was chosen to play Harold Abrahams. Rehearsals for the actors portraying athletes incorporated grueling training, including lengthy runs, with a British Military Fitness instructor. And when stars Jack Lowden and James McArdle discovered they live on the same London street, they began running to rehearsals in addition to the required group training.Gardner, Lyn. \\"Chariots of Fire: This One Will Run and Run\\". The Guardian. 6 May 2012. Differences from the film Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge, site of the Great Court Run In the 1981 film, screenwriter Colin Welland anchored the period story to the present by opening with Harold Abrahams' 1978 memorial service. In Mike Bartlett's 2012 play, the story is anchored to the present by beginning the piece with 15 modern athletes doing a warm-up, \\"which turns into a training session, which suddenly evolves into Lord Lindsay and Harold Abrahams.\\" Bartlett also used theatrical techniques to allow the play to \\"tell two stories at the same time, and show links between them and metaphors and parallels\\", using the Eric Liddell story to talk about Harold Abrahams and using Harold to talk about Eric. The play contains more meetings between Liddell and Abrahams than there were in the film, and also more humour.\\"Jack Fired Up as he Follows in Flying Footsteps of Olympics Legend Liddell\\". Southern Reporter. 21 May 2012. In contrast to the film, the play has Abrahams struggling with, in addition to anti-Semitism, thoughts of his estranged and never-present father. Director Edward Hall stated that, in addition, \\"In theatre you can take components of the story and analyse them narratively in different ways. So you can stretch or freeze a moment in a race.... it gives you more freedom.\\" Astute staging, he noted, can convey all of the various emotions that take place while running, and then finishing, a race.Hemming, Sarah. \\"Chariots of Fire Comes to the Stage\\".

And in contrast to the film, the play also introduces a female admirer for Eric Liddell: his real-life fianc√©e Florence Mackenzie, the daughter of Canadian missionaries to China.

Only two of her siblings survived to become adults.Alan Seaburg, Caroline Soule , the Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography, an on-line resource of the Unitarian Universalist History & Heritage Society. When she turned twelve, Soule began to attend the Albany Female Academy, graduating in 1841 with a gold medal for her essay, \\"The Goodness of God Not Fully Demonstrated Without the Act of Revelation.\\" Career In 1842, Soule was employed for two terms (seven months), without pay, as the principal of the female department of the Clinton Liberal Institute in Clinton, New York, a secondary school that had been founded in 1831 by the Universalist Church. Poor health compelled her to return to her family home in Albany. While in Clinton, Soule worked with principal Henry \\"Harry\\" Birdsell Soule (born July 1815 in Dover, New York; died January 29, 1852 in Lyons, New York), and by the end of the first term they were engaged to be married. They were married on August 28, 1843 in Albany by their mutual friend Aaron B. Grosh. After living in Utica, for a year they moved to Boston (1844‚Äì45) where Henry Soule candidated, hoping to be chosen associate and successor to the aging Hosea Ballou at Second Universalist Society in Boston. However, while his peers regarded him as a talented preacher, he was not chosen for this important position. Poor health limited his career.

After his death, she taught school briefly, however Soule's chief income was from writing and work as a religious editor. She prepared a biography of her husband for the Christian Ambassador, which was also issued as a tract. Soon afterward she expanded it into a book, Memoir of H. B. Soule (1852). As her stories had been well received by the Universalist public, she continued to turn them out for such Universalist magazines as the Rose of Sharon and the Ladies' Repository. A collection of these tales, Home Life; or A Peep Across the Threshold, was issued by the Boston Universalist publisher Abel Tompkins in 1855. While living in Granby she also edited the Rose-Bud, an annual for young people. In 1854, in order to live less expensively, Soule moved her family to a log cabin in Boonsboro, Iowa. In 1856 Soule married Ardon Benjamin Holcomb (Born June 23, 1804 in North Granby, Hartford, Connecticut; died September 29, 1879), a lawyer, and they had one son, Sumner White Holcomb (born August 29, 1857).Source Citation: Year: 1860; Census Place: Des Moines, Boone, Iowa; Roll: M653_312; Page: 258; Image: 258; Family History Library Film: 803312.

In 1856 Henry Bacon, editor of the Ladies' Repository (published by Tompkins), made her corresponding editor. Bacon's successor, Carolyn Sawyer, appointed Soule assistant editor, 1861‚Äì65. During these years she wrote two novels, Little Alice; or The Pet of the Settlement (1860), based on her life on the prairies, and Wine or Water: a Tale of New England (1862), a temperance story, both published by Tompkins. After her older children had become adults, Soule moved to Albany, New York in 1863 to get medical treatment for her failing eyesight. In 1867 she moved to Fordham, New York to live in a house that she named \\"Content\\" and opened an office in New York City where she continued her writing and editorial duties. She managed, edited, and contributed to the Guiding Star ( 1868‚Äì79), a semi- monthly for church school pupils. For seven months in 1873-74 she was the chief editor of the New York State Universalist newspaper, The Christian Leader.

As president of the WCA, which was at that time responsible for raising money for missionary work in Scotland, Soule was interested in meeting the Universalists there. There she preached, helped with the formation of the Scottish Universalist Convention, and participated in the dedication of the only church edifice owned by the Universalists, at Stenhousmuir.Clinton Lee Scott, The Universalist Church of America: A Short History (Universalist Historical Society, 1957):57. Soule's first formal pastorate was to the Liberal Christian Association of Elizabeth, New Jersey, beginning in 1876. In 1877 the WCA voted to send Soule as their missionary in Scotland. Arriving in 1878, Soule preached in Dunfermline, Larbert, Braidwood, Lochee, Dundee, and Glasgow, and in England and Ulster as well.

It is directed by Leone Pompucci and stars Luigi Lo Cascio and Laura Chiatti. It was aired on television as a two-parter. It is an adaptation of the homonym book by Giuseppe Pederiali. It has been presented at the 26th Festival international de programmes audiovisuels (FIPA) in Biarritz (France) on 25 and 26 January 2013 in the selections Fiction and Comp√©tition.fipa Plot The movie is about the story of the Italian athlete Dorando Pietri and restitutes the runner's fortunes and misfortunes at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. The start of Pietri's sporting career was a hard one. A passionate long-distance runner, like his brother Ulpiano, Dorando Pietri was rebuffed by trainer Barbisio because he was deemed to be too meager. Still, Pietri takes part in the marathon race at Carpi, his home town, and finishes first, ahead of Pericle Rondinella, the star runner of Barbisio's team. The day later though Rondinella was to beat Pietri in another race. Ottavio, an old but experienced trainer, was following both races and, recognizing Pietri's potential, he hires him to train for the Italian championships. Thanks to Ottavio's guidance Pietri soon becomes Italian champion and is selected to represent his country at the marathon event during the Games of the IV Olympiad, in 1908. On the D-day, Pietri runs a perfect marathon and is far ahead of his followers. But as he enters the London stadium to run the few remaining yards he is distracted and takes the wrong turn, gets disoriented, staggers and falls, gets up and falls again. The crowd cheers to encourage him standing up, and the referees too encourage him wholeheartedly. Pietri seems just exhausted. But as he sees his competitor, the American Johnny Hayes, entering the stadium, he gathers his very last forces, stands up, runs and collapses right after passing the finish line. Depiction of Dorando Pietri staggering across the finish line of the 1908 Olympic marathon The spectators and family who are following the scene are split in mixed feelings between joy and concerns for Pietri's condition. Will he survive, or was it too much? And then the good news comes: Pietri is safe and sound. But his hour of glory is short. The Americans lodge a complaint arguing that Pietri was supported to stand up. The victory is then assigned to Hayes. Moved by this misfortune, and to express the British people's admiration for him, Queen Alexandra presents to Pietri a cup filled with pounds exactly identical to the one presented to the winner. But can that really be a substitute for a denied victory? Dorando Pietri.

Family  Stephen Henry Hobhouse was born in Pitcombe, Somerset, England. He was the eldest son of Henry Hobhouse (1854‚Äì1937), a wealthy landowner and Liberal MP from 1885 to 1906, and Margaret Heyworth Potter.The Peerage: A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the royal families of Europe:Stephen Hobhouse Both sides of his family included a number of reformers and progressive politicians: * As an MP, his father was behind the Education Act of 1902. * His paternal cousin Emily Hobhouse (1860‚Äì1926) was known for bringing attention to British concentration camps in South Africa during the Second Boer War. Her views greatly influenced Stephen.Zedner, p. 248 * His paternal cousin Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse (1864‚Äì1929) was a sociologist and one of the founders of social liberalism. * His brother Sir Arthur Lawrence Hobhouse (1886‚Äì1965) was the architect of the system of National parks of England and Wales. * His maternal aunt Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith (1847-1929), was a social worker and internationalist. * His maternal aunt Beatrice Webb, Baroness Passfield (1858‚Äì1943), was a sociologist, economist, and social reformer who played key roles in founding both the London School of Economics and Political Science and the Fabian Society. * His maternal grandfather Richard Potter (1817‚Äì1892) was a chairman of the Great Western Railway. * His maternal great-grandfather Richard Potter (1778‚Äì1842) was a radical Liberal Party MP.  Education and formative years  Stephen Hobhouse was brought up as a member of the established Church of England.Brock, p. 14 He was educated at Eton, where he won prizes in both academics and sports, and at Balliol College, Oxford.Hochschild, pp. 220‚Äì222 Hobhouse attended Quaker meetings in Hampstead after graduation and officially became a member of the Society of Friends in 1909. The Second Boer War broke out when he was 18. He originally supported the war but his views were soon challenged by his cousin Emily. \\"Thus, no doubt, it was that my mind was prepared for the awakening\\". What he regarded as an awakening came from a 1902 reading of a pamphlet by Leo Tolstoy. This tract had a profound influence on him and he became an ardent lifelong pacifist.Hochschild, p. 277 He worked as a civil servant for seven years in the Board of Education.I appeal unto C√¶sar During the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, he resigned his post to go to Constantinople as a volunteer with a Quaker relief mission that helped refugees and saw firsthand the damage that war can do.  Marriage  In April 1915, Hobhouse married Rosa Waugh (1882‚Äì1971). He met her at a dinner party for Christian activists. She was also an activist, and spent three months in jail for distributing pacifist pamphlets. Rosa was also a prolific author on her own.Sue Young Histories: Rosa and Stephen Hobhouse and Homeopathy Together they wrote a biography of Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy.Hobhouse, Rosa Both Hobhouses were firm believers in homeopathy, and Steven even translated articles for the Homeopathic Journal.Homeopathic Journal: Volume 3, Issue 5, Mar 2010 (Historical Papers) As eldest son of a wealthy family, Stephen stood to inherit a large fortune, but, influenced by Tolstoy again, he renounced his inheritance.

At the same time they joined the Quaker Society of Friends and became active in Quaker service.  Pacifism and prison  Hobhouse was conscripted into the army in 1916. At a tribunal in August 1916, he was granted an exemption from military service so long as he joined the Friends Ambulance Unit. As an absolutist or unconditionalist conscientious objector, however, Hobhouse refused either to accept the decision or to appeal against it. He ignored a notice to report to barracks, was arrested by the civil police, brought before a magistrates' court, and handed over to the military. He refused to put on military uniform, was court-martialled and sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour. Hobhouse was then placed in solitary confinement because he refused to obey the \\"Rule of Silence\\" forbidding prisoners to speak to one another. He wrote to his wife: \\"The spirit of love requires that I should speak to my fellow-prisoners, the spirit of truth that I should speak to them openly\\"Hochschild, p. 270 By mid-1917, after 112 days in jail, followed by a second jail sentence, his health was declining rapidly.Moorehead, pp. 271‚Äì2 (His health had always been frail: he had previously suffered nervous breakdowns and scarlet fever.Hochschild, p. 276) His wife was very angry about his treatment in prison and some said that he never recovered his health entirely. In 1917 Hobhouse wrote:Brock, p. 18 > Nearly every feature of prison life seems deliberately arranged to destroy a > man's sense of his own personality, his power of choice and initiative, his > possessive instincts, his concept of himself as a being designed to love and > serve his fellow-man.

As the publisher of The North American, he was active in public affairs and chaired the Executive Consolidation Committee, which developed the Act of Consolidation of 1854 and expanded the borders of the city of Philadelphia to encompass all of Philadelphia County. He served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1866 to 1869. Early life McMichael was born in Bordentown, New Jersey to John and Hannah McMichael. His father was employed at the estate of Joseph Bonaparte, the older brother of Napoleon Bonaparte and former King of Spain. His family moved to Philadelphia while still young. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, and then read law and was admitted to the Philadelphia bar in 1827. Newspaper career Morton McMichael became an editor of The Saturday Evening Post in 1826. From 1831 to 1836 he was editor-in-chief of the Saturday Courier. In 1836 he founded the Saturday News, and published the Saturday Gazette with Joseph C. Neal from 1844 to 1847. At the outset of 1847, he became a publisher of The North American, which could claim as a successor to the Pennsylvania Packet to be the oldest daily newspaper in the United States. The paper grew to prominence under McMichael, who became sole publisher in 1854 (when co-owner Robert Montgomery Bird died). He remained publisher until his own death in 1879, though his sons took over active operations in his final years.(7 January 1879). Death of Morton McMichael, The New York TimesBloom, Robert L.

He began his service as a police magistrate and then an Alderman in Philadelphia. As an alderman, he also served as Justice of the Peace for the County of Philadelphia. In 1843 he was elected Sheriff of Philadelphia County, serving until 1846. McMichael served as Sheriff during the Philadelphia Bible Riots of 1844.

In 1854, McMichael chaired the Executive Consolidation Committee, which merged the city of Philadelphia with many of the surrounding districts into a single political entity.http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/consolidation-act-of-1854/ His newspaper also argued for a new street numbering system to replace the city‚Äôs confusing address system, which often numbered houses in the order they were built rather than by location and resulted in fractional house numbers along streets. In 1965, McMichael defeated Democrat Daniel M. Fox by 5,000 votes and was elected as the Mayor of Philadelphia. While he was mayor, the Fairmount Park Commission was established. McMichael served on the board and, once his term ended in 1869, was appointed as president of the commission, serving until his death. In 1873 he was appointed a delegate at large to the fourth Constitutional convention of Pennsylvania. This resulted in the establishment of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874. McMichael died on January 6, 1879 as a result of inflammatory rheumatism. He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

A 2018 study found that 78,300 transgender people in just eight U.S. states might be disenfranchised because of photo ID laws. There are bureaucratic as well as social obstacles to updating identification documents. Many policies were enacted at a time when it was assumed that in order for transition from one gender to another to be complete, a person had to undergo sex reassignment surgery. However, modern health experts' current understanding is that transitions are an individualized process that can involve a variety of steps, sometimes involving surgery, but often not. As of 2019, GLAD is running the \\"Pop-Up ID Project,\\" which provides free legal representation to transgender residents of the six New England states for the purpose of updating their documents. = Utility bill = In accordance with the Help America Vote Act, some states allow voters to use two forms of identification that only list name and address, such as a utility bill, which alleviates the issue of having to change one's gender on a document. = Birth certificate = While birth certificates can be used as voter identification in non-photo identification states, birth certificate laws are established at the state level and commonly require that the individual undergo surgery in order for the gender on the document to be updated. Some states even make it mandatory that transgender people acquire a court order in order to change the gender on their birth certificate, which presents even more financial obstacles. The first case to deal with legal recognition of transgender identity in the United States was In re Anonymous v. WeinerIn re Anonymous v. Weiner, 270 N.Y.S.2d 319 (N.Y. App. Div. 1966). in 1966.See In re Estate of Gardiner, 29 Kan. App. 2d 92, 109, 22 P.3d 1086 (2001) (remarking that Weiner was \\"the first case in the United States to deal with transsexualism\\"). A post-operative male-to-female trans woman applied for a change of sex on her birth certificate through the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the New York City Health Department. The Bureau turned to the Board of Health who then called on a committee on public health of the New York Academy of Medicine to make a recommendation. The application was ultimately denied and the Board of Health stated that \\"an individual born one sex cannot be changed for the reasons proposed by the request which was made to us. Sex can be changed where there is an error, of course, but not when there is a later attempt to change psychological orientation of the patient and including such surgery as goes with it.\\"In re Estate of Gardiner, 273 Kan. 191, 200, 42 P.3d 120 (2002) (quoting In re Anonymous v. Weiner, 270 N.Y.S.2d 319, ___ (N.Y. App. Div. 1966)) (internal quotation marks omitted). As of March 2018, surgery is a prerequisite for changing one's gender marker on birth certificates issued by 25 states. Those states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The remaining states either may change the birth certificate without proof of surgery or will not change the birth certificate at all.  Presenting identity documents  The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy estimated that by requiring voters to present a government-issued photo ID at the polls, nine states may have disenfranchised over 25,000 transgender people in the November 2012 presidential election, The report estimated that there are 88,000 eligible transgender voters in these nine strict photo ID states, of whom approximately 25,000 do not have identification or records that reflect their gender. because poll workers are unlikely to have training on how to handle transgender people, and may erroneously suspect voter fraud. Transgender individuals may also be discouraged from voting under these circumstances because of prior experiences with presenting identification that does not accurately reflect their gender: 40% percent of transgender people reported being harassed in situations where they presented gender incongruent identification, while 15% reported being asked to leave the venue where the identification had been presented, and 3% reported being assaulted or attacked as a result of presenting their ID. Additionally, 22% percent reported being denied equal treatment or being verbally harassed by government officials.  Felon disenfranchisement and transgender incarceration  Transgender people lack employment discrimination protection, and face high rates of homelessness and harassment. 16% of transgender people have reported being incarcerated at some point in their lives, compared to 2.7% of the general American population.Also nearly half (47%) of black transgender people have been incarcerated at some point, while 38% reported harassment during police interactions.

It can be considered the heart of the city, akin to the Champs Elys√©es and the chief avenues of many capitals. As it leads to the Royal Palace of Narayanhiti, it is also known the King's Way among foreigners, Durbar meaning, as in the Moghul Empire, a royal gathering or court. It is a major tourist draw, vying with Thamel. It is flanked by luxury hotels (e.g. Hotel Del' Annapurna), restaurants serving international cuisine, global shopping brand outlets in refined centres including expensive boutiques, travel agencies, a couple of embassies and commercial banking headquarters and premium real estate such as international airline offices. Location/History A statue of King Mahendra, father of King Birendra stands in the center of the roundabout at the junction of Durbarmarg with Jamal maintained by Hotel Del' Annapurna. The ancient settlement of Jamal was a victim of the Ranas' enthusiasm for building. The rulers seized land from farmers and monasteries, demolishing an old bahal to make way for the new road. The bahal, one time abode of the White (Sveta) Matsyendranath, stood where the god's image had been found in a field, an event commemorated every year at the Jana Baha Dyah Jatra. Sveta Matsyendranath chariot is assembled and driven three times round the spot over which the statue of King Mahendra now presides. Also on Durbar Marg, the greater part of which was built during the Rana era, are the campus of Tri-Chandra College and a mosque used by the valley's Muslim minority. Recently, the Royal Palace was turned into a public museum immediately after the country was declared a republic. Few years back there has been a recent upsurge in the construction activities in the region. Durbarmarg is a central junction for the road connecting Lazimpat and Thamel, Bhat-Bhateni and Baluwatar, New Road and Asan and Putali Sadak and Kamaladi. Durbar Marg is one of the most well maintained and cleanest places in the Kathmandu valley, and a green belt has been created in the side way. Narayanhiti Palace Museum, luxury hotels, shopping malls, discos, pubs and famous branded showroom's have been a special feature of Durbar Marg.

Ecology Ranging from southern Oregon down to the northern reaches of the Mexican state of Baja California, monkeyface pricklebacks are coastal fish that live in rocky, tidal areas close to shore. First described by Girard in 1854, the fish spawn on the sea floor and show some nest guarding behavior. While young monkeyface pricklebacks feed on zooplankton and crustaceans, adults are primarily herbivorous, feeding on red and green algae. Adults have few predators other than humans, but young fish are vulnerable to birds and other fish, such as grass rockfish. The species reaches a maximum size of and may live up to 18 years. The heaviest monkeyface prickleback recorded to date was just over . Fishery Two monkeyface pricklebacks at the California Academy of Sciences Monkeyface pricklebacks have long been sought after for their edible white flesh, with remains found in the middens of Native American peoples along the California coast. In the modern era, the fish's appeal is and has always been mostly among amateur anglers. The most common method of acquiring it is \\"poke poling\\": a technique involving a long bamboo rod and a baited hook stuck into the crevices where monkeyface prickleback are known to hide. In 2012, a fad for monkeyface eel in restaurants of the San Francisco Bay Area spawned a tiny commercial fishery, mostly spurred by local foragers interested in catch that is unusual and less heavily fished.

Population: History The village of Mostishchi was first mentioned in 1412. In this year, the Nikolayevsky Mostishchinsky Monastery was founded. In 1907, Mostishchi was mentioned as a part of Troitskaya Volost of Novgorodsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. The origin of the settlement of Pankovka is unclear. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Novgorodsky District was established, with the center in the city of Novgorod. Both Pankovka and Mostishchi became a part of the district. The governorate was abolished as well, and the district belonged to Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. Between August, 1941, and January, 1944 Pankovka was occupied by German troops. On July 5, 1944, Novgorodsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast. On March 28, 1977 the village of Mostishchi and the settlement of Pankovka were merged into the urban-type settlement of Pankovka.

He also formed successful tag teams with Jerry Martell, Derek St. Holmes, and Cody Deaner, and is widely considered to be one of Ontario's best \\"heel\\" performers. In his career, Barry wrestled for various wrestling promotions: All World Wrestling League, Great Lakes Championship Wrestling, MainStream Wrestling Entertainment, Pure Wrestling Association, Rage Wrestling Entertainment, Rough Wrestling International, and World Class Canadian Wrestling. In the US, he has also made appearances for AWA Superstars, specifically AWA Brew City Wrestling in Wisconsin and AWA Mid- Atlantic in North Carolina, and the National Wrestling Alliance. He has also made brief guest appearances for World Wrestling Entertainment, in addition to a considerable number of other independent wrestling promotions in the Great Lakes region. Early life David Barry was born in Chatham, New Brunswick. He was involved in physical contact sports at an early age, particularly martial arts, and started kickboxing at age 19. He had a total of 13 amateur fights and 4 professional fights before leaving the sport. Though he had an undefeated record, he later cited the negative attitude necessary to have when facing opponents was the major reason for giving up professional fighting. Professional wrestling career =Early career in the Ontario independents= After giving up kickboxing, Barry turned to pro wrestling. He spent five months in the gym lifting weights and working on his conditioning before walking into a wrestling school. Barry originally trained under Ernie \\"The Executioner\\" Moore in Burlington, Ontario, but later studied with Steve Keirn and Tom Prichard in the United States. After eight months of training he made his pro debut July 4, 1999, at the Leander Boat Club in Hamilton. He and his opponent, Jerry Martell, later formed a tag team called the East West Connection 2K1. It was in the Hamilton-based Empire Wrestling Federation where Barry made his debut as \\"Quinson Valentino\\", a cocky egotistical star from Beverly Hills, California. EWF promoter Bob Woods had planned a different \\"gimmick\\" for Barry, however, the young wrestler disliked the idea and improvised his own ring character on the fly. A childhood fan of Jesse Ventura, Ric Flair, Bruiser Brody, Rick Rude and Randy Savage, Barry incorporated some of their personalities and wrestling styles into his new in- ring persona. His finisher, for example, was a modified version of Rude's \\"Rude Awakening\\" neckbreaker. These creative differences, as well as a disagreement over the direction of his career, caused a real-life falling out between the two men and resulted in Barry leaving the promotion. =Great Lakes Championship Wrestling= Shortly after leaving the EWF, Barry joined Scott Chase's Great Lakes Championship Wrestling in Brantford, Ontario. He helped Chase as a booker during its first few months but decided to leave the position, around the time he won the promotion's heavyweight championship, so as not to create a bad atmosphere among the roster. Barry won the GLCW Heavyweight Championship in late-2003 and spend the next several months feuding with the top babyface Scott Chase. Their feud extended to other Ontario-based promotions as well with Barry challenging Chase for the Canadian Grand Prix Wrestling heavyweight title in Cornwall on March 5, 2004. Another highlight in their feud occurred one week later when Barry teamed up with \\"The Real Deal\\" Magnus and \\"As Seen On TV\\" Notorious T.I.D. in a 6-man tag match to face Scott Chase, JQ Publik and \\"Mr. USA\\" Tony Atlas in Chase's hometown of Brantford. His time in GLCW established himself as one of the top heels on the Ontario independent circuit and was one of several GLCW stars to go to World Wrestling Entertainment. =Camp Martell= While working for GLCW, he and Jerry Martell, Flexx Falcone, Morgan Storm started \\"Camp Martell\\", a wrestling school associated with their home promotion. In August 2002, Barry was involved in a car accident with other members of Camp Martell. Though he himself was not injured, he was traveling in a second vehicle and witnessed the accident in his rear view mirror. Barry later helped the injured wrestlers, Flexx Falcone, DWK, and Luke Slater, get medical assistance in Moncton. Barry and Falcone eventually took over the school after Martell and Morgan Storm decided to leave GLCW. It was later renamed the Wrestlecorps Pro Wrestling Academy and had the involvement of other Ontario independent wrestlers. =Elsewhere in Canada= Over the next two years Barry worked for various of independent promotions in Ontario and the Maritimes including Powerslam Wrestling Extreme, MainStream Wrestling, Canadian Independent Wrestling Alliance, and Canadian Professional Wrestling. He also received tryout matches with World Wrestling Entertainment appearing on the November 3rd edition of WWE Raw in Cleveland, Ohio and November 6 edition of WWE Smackdown in Buffalo, New York. He later described his positive experience in the WWE locker room, including making a valuable connection with Hurricane Shane Helms, in interviews with SLAM! Sports and other Canadian websites. In August 2003 Barry returned to the Maritimes where he headlined a live event for Canadian Pro Wrestling with Chi Chi Cruz, Scott Savage, Tony Armstrong, and The Highlanders (Robbie and Rory McAllister). Barry was one of several wrestlers who criticized the promotion for its overuse of backyard wrestlers. =Valentino in the United States= By the end of 2003, Barry began expanding beyond eastern Canada and into the United States making appearances in the All World Wrestling League (Michigan), Ultimate Championship Wrestling (Michigan), WOW Wrestling (Wisconsin), Cleveland All-Pro Wrestling (Ohio), World Wrestling Alliance (Indiana), World Wrestling Alliance (Massachusetts), and NWA East (Pennsylvania). His travels brought him as far as North Carolina where he competed for Southern Championship Wrestling and Alternative Championship Wrestling, winning the latter promotion's heavyweight title. He remained ACW Heavyweight Champion until the company merged with CWF Mid-Atlantic; he lost to CWF Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Champion Ric Converse in a Triangle unification match, also involving Corey Edsel, in Seagrove, North Carolina on January 31, 2004. Several months later at a television taping for \\"CWF Championship Wrestling\\", Barry lost to GeeStar in an intergender match, her first title defense as the first female CWF Mid-Atlantic Television Champion. As several Canadian promotions often operated on a seasonal basis, Barry periodically returned to Ontario. In March, he toured with MainStream Wrestling Entertainment for its annual tour of the Maritimes. On May 18, he and The Missing Link wrestled to a double-disqualification at a show for the Canadian Independent Wrestling Alliance at Peterborough's Club Vibe. He also continued to wrestle for Pro Wrestling Xtreme at various times during the year. Barry found early success in Michigan's All World Wrestling League. At a \\"Big Time Wrestling TV\\" television taping for Lansing's ABC53 Studios, he won the vacant AWWL Television Championship by defeating Thurston Brooks, Gutter, and Big Jake in a Fatal Four Way elimination match on August 23, 2004. On June 10, 2005, Barry defeated Ricky Stryc9 for the AWWL Heavyweight Championship at \\"War Games II\\" in Mason, Michigan. The match was not without controversy, however, as Barry was helped by outside interference from promoter Ed Farhat, Jr. and his henchman Medicine. He surrendered the television title at a subsequent show and defeated Ricky Stryc9 in a rematch at \\"War Games 4\\" in Ionia on August 12, 2005. Similarly, he enjoyed a championship reign in NWA All-Star Championship Wrestling winning the heavyweight title in a 2-day tournament; he eliminated TC Washington in the opening round, Silas Young in the semi-finals, and Mason Quinn in the finals to win the belt. He dropped it to J-Cash in Green Bay, Wisconsin in September after four-month run. Earlier that year, Barry also participated in a special fundraiser, \\"Smackdown on Cancer\\", for Championship International Wrestling at Hillsdale High School in Hillsdale, Michigan. That summer also saw Barry make a return to World Wrestling Entertainment. He first appeared in a backstage segment on WWE's Judgment Day pay-per-view where he was questioned by Booker T in a dressing room with Shannon Moore, Hardcore Holly, and Charlie Hass on the whereabouts of Kurt Angle. That same week, he wrestled at TV tapings for WWE RAW (May 23) and Smackdown! (May 24); Barry's Smackdown! opponent, Booker T (with Sharmell), pinned him following a scissors kick. =Return to Canada= Barry was also wrestling in Canada during this period. In the summer months, he worked shows for Pro Wrestling Xtreme and Chuck Simpson's Rough Wrestling International. On May 14, 2005, Barry lost to Elian Habanaro in a 3-way match also involving Eddie Osbourne at a Pro Wrestling Xtreme show in Goderich, Ontario. On October 23, 2005, Barry and Cody Deaner won the GLCW Tag Team Championship from Models Inc. (Flexx Falcone and Sean Spears) in Brantford, Ontario. The two continued to defend the belts until GLCW merged with Pure Wrestling Attitude in March 2006. Their last official title defense was at the March 12th \\"GLCW vs. PWA\\" show in Brantford where they defeated PWA Tag Team Champions Phil Latio and Pantalone in a unification match; due to a pre-match stipulation Latio was forced to retire. Their championship reign was brief, however, as they lost the belts to the South Side Stranglers (Southside Strangler #1 and #2) later on in the show. At a follow-up show, \\"The PWA/GLCW War\\", Barry wrestled L‚ÄôArtiste who was widely believed to be the supposedly retired Phil Latio.Laidlaw, Gordo. \\"Gordo, the wizard of id, Reviews: PURE WRESTLING ASSOCIATION, The PWA/GLCW War April 30/06, J‚Äôs Place ‚Äì 7 Erie Ave Brantford, Ontario.\\" Declarationofindependents.net.

In the spring of 2006, Barry toured across Ontario with the Canadian Independent Wrestling Alliance, making stops in Brantford, Havelock, Oshawa, Peterborough, and Sault Ste. Marie. On June 3, he and \\"The Sniper\\" Randy Vahn defeated Blackjack Phoenix and Thorn in a non- title match for the AWA World Tag Team Championship at Eastdale High School in Welland, Ontario. It was originally supposed to be a title bout but Thorn's regular tag team partner was unable to make the event and Phoenix was substituted in his place.Laidlaw, Gordo. \\"Gordo, the wizard of id, reviews: Rough Wrestling International, 03 June 06 @ Eastdale High School, Welland Ontario.\\" Declarationofindependents.net.

Ware at a wrestling event held at the Pickering Markets on September 30-October 1. It was around this time that Barry returned to the States to join Daryk St. Holmes in AWA Brew City Wrestling as one-half of The Aristocrats (replacing Danny Scott). The team feuded with The Soul Shooters (\\"Poison\\" Appollo Starr and Drew \\"The Don\\" Johnson) over the BCW Tag Team Championship and eventually lost the belts to them in Waukesha, Wisconsin the following year. On December 9, 2006, he beat Reggie Marley at Mecca Pro Wrestling's \\"Holiday Holocaust\\" in Cornwall. A week later he participated in Rough Wrestling International's \\"The Clash for Christmas\\", a two-day charity event to benefit the victims of a major apartment fire the previous month. Barry wrestled RWI Heavyweight Champion The Quebec Mauler in the main event. On January 6, 2007, Barry wrestled \\"Daytona Beach Bad Boy\\" Jason Cage at CWA Quebec's \\"New Year's Bashing\\" in Cornwall, Ontario. A week later, he defended the RWE Heavyweight Championship in a Triple Threat match against \\"MVP\\" Michael Von Payton and Drake Styles at the Carleton Place Arena. Though he briefly lost the title when it was declared vacant, Barry quickly regained the title from MVP at RWE's \\"Lost Aggression\\" on February 13.

As a result of his victory, Styles was granted a title shot at the promotion's next major event. His three-month championship reign was ended by Styles at \\"Unstoppable\\" on May 19. The two met in a handicap match, with Barry joined by Rahim Ali, and although his opponent was at a disadvantage Styles received unexpected help from Ali's valet Misty Haven allowing him to pin Ali. On July 8, Barry wrestled Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine for the vacant CGPW Heavyweight Championship at a Canadian Grand Prix Wrestling event in Morrisburg, Ontario. Although billed as a 60-min. Iron Man match, their bout ended after 6 minutes. The following week, Barry appeared for The League's debut show, \\"Wrestlerock\\", in London, Ontario where he defeated Norman Smiley. On August 24, he defended the RWI Heavyweight Championship against Chris Laplante at Rough Wrestling International's \\"Battle at the Beach 3\\" in Port Colborne.

President Ayers was also announced the special guest referee. In the main event later that night, LaPlante pinned Barry to win the title with the help of Sik Rik Matrix. Towards the end of the year, Barry wrestled for the short-lived World Class Canadian Wrestling where he aligned himself with Club Carnage (Blackjack Phoenix, Lance Malibu, and manager Xavier Sterling). At its September 7 \\"Chaos At Crystal Ridge\\" show in Ridgeway, Ontario, he took part in a \\"Crystal Ridge Tornado Tag Team match\\" with Chris Laplante, Brodie Lee, and Lance Malibu. The winners were to wrestle each other to decide the number one contender for the WCCW North American Heavyweight Championship.

N.p., Sept. 2007. Web. Jan. 27, 2012. . The title was vacated a short time afterwards and a championship tournament was held to crown a new champion. On November 2, Barry entered the one-night tournament defeating The Wyld Stallyon in the first round and Jimmy Jam Olsen in the finals to win the belt. The next month, Barry wrestled for a special RWI benefit show for the Salvation Army at Eastdale High School in Welland, Ontario. He wrestled Chris LaPlante for the RWI Heavyweight Championship but was anable to win back the title. =Final year on the independents= Barry spent the last year of his career in the Ontario independents. On January 12, 2008, he joined \\"Sniper\\" Randy Vahn and Krystal Banks in a 3-on-2 intergender handicap match against Chuck \\"The Butcher\\" Simpson and \\"Anti-Diva\\" Kaitlyn Diemond at an RWI show in Welland, Ontario, which Barry's team lost via disqualification. A week later, he entered Pro Wrestling Xtreme's \\"Woodstock Championship Tournament\\" in Woodstock, Ontario and made it to the finals before being eliminated by Hayden Avery. He also made a return to Michigan to team with Prince Erebus, Brother Cat Jackson, and Monster Ryot in an 8-man tag team match against AWWL Heavyweight Champion Harker Dirge, Blackjack Phoenix, The Unknown Commentator, and Cowabunga Dude for a March 1 TV taping in Saginaw, Michigan; according to the pre-match stipulations, the wrestler who scored the winning pinfall would win the championship. On April 6, Barry made a surprise appearance at IWA-Ontario All Pro's \\"Breaking the Barrier\\" in Oshawa, Ontario as a \\"handpicked\\" opponent for Mike Stevens. Stevens' victory over Barry earned him the right to face Sex, Drugs and Wrestling (Ash and Kris Chambers) in the main event. Later that month, Barry took part in MainStream Wrestling Entertainment's annual spring tour of the Maritimes, the largest such tour in the country. One of the highlights of the tour was Barry's match against the 7 ft., 300 lbs. MSW Heavyweight Champion Giant Grimez on April 25, at the War Memorial Community Centre in Windsor, and their rematch at the Digby Arena the following night. For much of the year, Barry also wrestled shows for the Pure Wrestling Association, Ontario All Pro Wrestling and International Wrestling Entertainment. On August 9, he and Al Snow appeared for IWE's debut show at Hamilton Place's Studio Theatre, defeating both Scott Chase and HC Loc, as well as Chris Laplante on its second show the following month. On September 20, 2008, Barry wrestled his final match against Kryss Thorn for a RWI event in Welland.

Although they do have wings they are flightless. Taxonomy This species was first described by John O. Westwood in 1844 under the name Lucanus reticulatus. It was placed in the Paralissotes genus in 1995. Description Paralissotes reticulatus in the wild, Upper Hutt, New Zealand Including mandibles, male beetles have a length of 12.7-21.8 mm; female beetles from 13.8-21.3 mm. The beetle ranges from small to medium-sized with a glossy black exoskeleton. The reticulate name has its origin in the reticulate pattern of depressed scaly areas and non-scaly areas. Its head is widest in front of the eyes. Male and female beetles have similar sized mandibles. Like other Paralissotes species, this beetle is flightless despite having vestigial wings. Distribution Paralissotes reticulatus observed in Dunedin Paralissotes reticulatus is the most widespread species in its genus, having been collected from the Bay of Plenty to South Canterbury. There have been recent collections of this species near Dunedin. It is found from near sea level to an altitude of about 950m. Ecology Like other stag beetles, adult Paralissotes reticulatus has been collected from underneath the decaying logs of native trees. The larvae are found inside rotting wood in an advanced state of decay. Like other Paralissotes species, this beetle is mostly seen at night, but may be seen during the day during wet conditions.

The campaign was introduced and is predominantly funded by The Zombie Research Society (ZRS), an organization dedicated to the historic, cultural and scientific study of the living dead that was founded in 2007. According to the ZRS, the main objective of Zombie Awareness Month is to educate people about causes, prevention and preparation for a supposed future zombie pandemic. Timing Zombies as portrayed in the movie Night of the Living Dead The campaign runs every year from May 1 to May 31. The month of May was chosen because a number of notable zombie films are set in May, such as the classic George A. Romero zombie film, Night of the Living Dead. In addition, the sense of hope, renewal and optimism that the spring season brings gives a contrast to the darkness of a zombie apocalypse. Despite cultural trends, zombies are not related to the Pagan-based traditions of Halloween involving witches, ghouls, and vampires, which is why Zombie Awareness Month does not take place in October. However, in 2012, the US Center for Disease Control promoted a Zombie Awareness Month in October. Activities A 2012 zombie walk in Toronto Supporters of the movement wear gray ribbons to spread awareness. The gray ribbon signifies the shadows that lurk behind the light of day. The gray ribbon is associated with other causes such as brain cancer awareness, diabetes awareness and asthma awareness, however Zombie Awareness Month is not associated with any other supportive movement. Many supporters use the opportunity to host charitable events such as Zombie Runs, Zombie Walks and Zombie Food Drives. There was some discrepancy over the seriousness to which Zombie Awareness Month activities should be taken. Matt Mogk, the original founder of the Zombie Research Society, took a more serious approach to the month. While he encouraged the support and exposure that comes with Zombie Walks, he did not view the time as a celebration, and preferred that it be used to educate and prepare people for the impending zombie apocalypse. However, the Zombie Research Society has since added a number experts, artists, and authors to their official Advisory Board who specialize in zombie culture. They recognize that zombies can reflect society‚Äôs fears of terrorism, biological infection, and societal collapse. In fact, many Zombie Awareness Month activities can help people process these feelings, and alleviate the fear they may have. In addition, the process of \\"prepping\\" for a zombie apocalypse by gathering supplies, nonperishable food, firearms, ammo and water can help people prepare for any type of real-world disaster.

By the 1911, the residents had established numerous performance and athletic clubs. The life in Villa Petrolea went into decline at the advent of World War I when German and Austro-Hungarian nationals were expelled from the Russian Empire. The settlement was nationalized in 1919. =The park= The Villa Petrolea park had an area of 10.5 hectares and designed by landscape architects from Poland. The oil-saturated earth was covered by fertile soil shipped from Lankaran, the subtropical part of Azerbaijan.

After the establishment of the Soviet rule, the park was expanded to 15 hectares, and in 1931 it was named Rote Fahne (German for \\"Red Banner\\") which marked the handing over of the Transferable Red Banner from the oil workers of Baku to the Berlin proletariat in 1925.

It owes its name to the fact that it connects two major basilicas, the Basilica of San Lorenzo and the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio. The park has an overall area of 40.700 m2, bisected by Via Molino delle Armi, one the avenues comprising the Cerchia dei Navigli ring road (this was originally intended to be adapted into an underpass, but the plan was never implemented).

At the time, the area had marshes of polluted water produced by the tanneries located in the adjacent Piazza della Vetra, as well as old buildings in a state of decay.

Architects Pier Fausto Bagatti Valsecchi and Antonio Grandi, enrolled in 1956, conceived the new park as a sort of archaeological promenade connecting the two basilicas, the Colonne di San Lorenzo, and the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre. The area surrounding the park and the Colonne di San Lorenzo is one of the most popular night-life districts of Milan, with a number of bars, pubs, disco clubs, and other venues of the so-called \\"Milanese movida\\". In the last decades of the 20th century, security issues were repeatedly reported, including vandalisms, drug trafficking, excessive noise and abusive parking. Carlo Lovati, Piazza Vetra, ventiquattr'ore di degrado, ¬´Corriere della Sera¬ª, May 1, 1999 These problems were addressed in the park renovation that took place in 2000, on the occasion of the Great Jubilee; specifically, the whole area of the park was fenced and security cameras were installed. On the same occasion, the green area was also partially redesigned, and the name of the park was formally changed to \\"Parco Papa Paolo Giovanni II\\". Parco Giovanni Paolo II Features Besides its architectural and archaeological sites of interests (i.e., the two basilicas and the Roman ruins), the park is renowned for its ornamental trees; tree species that can be found in the park include several species of maples (Acer) such as maple ash (A. negundo), Norway maple (A. platanoides), and silver maple (A. saccharinum), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), French oak (Quercus robur), several species of elm (Ulmus), black poplar (Populus nigra), European black pine (Pinus nigra), London plane (Platanus √ó acerifolia), and pagoda tree (Sophora japonica).

The film stars Eddie Albert, Rosemary Lane, Wayne Morris, Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman. The film was released by Warner Bros. on April 27, 1940. The film is based on the hit 1925 play The Butter and Egg Man, written by George S. Kaufman.  Plot  Peter \\"Tex\\" Coleman (Eddie Albert), a butter and egg man from Texas, comes to New York with his mother's life savings to buy a hotel in the big city and be near his stage struck sweetheart, Lydia Weston (Rosemary Lane). Upon his arrival, Tex finds Lydia working as a secretary for a couple of fast-talking producers rather than being the stage star that her home town thinks she has become. Tex is just the angel for whom sharpshooter producers Mac McClure (Wayne Morris) and Marty Allen (Ronald Reagan) have been waiting, because they have a play set for rehearsal but no money to produce it, and their leading lady, Valerie Blayne (Ruth Terry), is adding to their problems by threatening reprisals from her gangster boyfriend, Pooch Davis (Milburn Stone), unless the show opens on schedule. Tex agrees to invest his money in the show if Lydia is given the lead, and when Mac and Marty consent to his terms, the play goes into rehearsal as a drama with two leading ladies. When Valerie threatens Mac with bodily harm unless she plays the lead, Mac informs Tex that he is going to fire Lydia unless he buys the entire show. Sensing that the play would work as a farce, Marty's wife Marge puts up the money on the condition that Tex play the male lead. True to Marge's instincts, on opening night, the play has the audience rolling in the aisles as dynamite planted on stage by Valerie's vindictive boyfriend explodes, and the actors' performances are so bad that they are funny. As a comedy, the show becomes a smash success, but when a plagiarism suit looms on the horizon, Tex and Marge sell the show back to its eager producers and leave them holding the bag.

Biomesh (or biologic mesh) is a type of surgical mesh made from an organic biomaterial (such as porcine dermis, porcine small intestine submucosa, bovine dermis or pericardium, and the dermis or fascia lata of a cadaveric human). Biologic mesh is primarily indicated for several types of hernia repair, including inguinal and ventral hernias, hernia prophylaxis, and contaminated hernia repairs. However, it has also been used in pelvic floor dysfunction, parotidectomy, and reconstructive plastic surgery. The development of biologic mesh largely has derived from the need of a biocompatible material that addresses \\"the problems associated with a permanent synthetic mesh, including chronic inflammation, foreign body reaction, fibrosis, and mesh infection.\\" , however, the efficacy and optimal use of biological mesh products remains in question. Development, benefits, and drawbacks The idea of using organic materials for surgical mesh has been around since at least the late 1950s, though researchers soon learned the materials they tested weren't biocompatible. Research into more compatible biomaterials occurred in the proceeding decades, including the search for cellular-based materials extracted from humans and animals. For example, in 1980, research presented at the first ever World Biomaterials Congress detailed the examined use of dermal collagen of sheep to construct biological mesh for reconstructive surgery. Since then, \\"research for developing and improvising the biological material required for the production of these meshes\\" has been ongoing. Typical advantages attributed to biologic meshes include reducing the risk of infection (from using non-biologic surgical meshes) and is absorbed into the resulting scar as part of cellular ingrowth. Commonly described drawbacks include the high cost of the material and its uncertain clinical effectiveness, particularly in regards to the cost. An August 2015 follow-up literature review published by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health in particular addressed these drawbacks, concluding: > Based on the publications identified for the current report, there remains a > lack of sufficient evidence to guide clinical practice regarding the use of > biological mesh products ... Several surgical indications are addressed by > this collection of [randomized controlled trials (RCTs)] with relatively few > studies per indication. Therefore, it is not immediately apparent whether > this represents a significant amount of research on the clinical > effectiveness of any particular mesh product or for any specific patient > population that would support clinical decision making. Further rigorously > designed RCTs are required to clarify comparative clinical effectiveness and > safety of the many available biological mesh products for most surgical > indications in which their use has been suggested. =Contamination considerations= The presence of contamination may limit the applicability of permanent synthetic mesh in some procedures such as hernia repair. Biologic mesh may be acceptable for this purpose or for placement in open wounds as a staged closure in complex abdominal wall reconstruction. There is limited data in both of these areas, with some noting a high risk of hernia recurrence and associated infection. The data is mostly limited to animal models and case series.Saettele TM, Bachman SL, Costello CR, Grant SA, Cleveland DS, Loy TS, Kolder DG, Ramshaw BJ.

It lies between the settlements of Auchentiber and Irvine on the A736 Lochlibo Road.  History  Torranyard is a hamlet at what is now a crossroads on the Irvine to Glasgow A736 'Lochlibo Road', previous to the main road's construction, circa 1820, it sat on the toll road that ran from Kilwinning and Irvine via Benslie to Glasgow, passing Loch Libo at Uplawmoor en route. Roy's map of 1747 records the settlement of 'Turringyard' near Auchenharvie Castle .Roy's Map Retrieved : 2012-05-06 The 1897 25 inch to the mile OS map records a 'Tour Inn' opposite the old Torranyard Toll, now the Torranyard Tabdoori. . It was recorded as 'Turnyard' in 1775, 'Tirranyard' on Thomson's 1820 map and in 1832. The Montgreenan estate is nearby and the site of the old Girgenti house and surviving tower are nearby on the Cunninghamhead road. The meaning of 'Tour' in ScotsA_Researcher's_Guide_to_Local_History_Terminology is 'Tower', as in the prominent Auchenharvie castle tower nearby. A Yard in Scots is a garden. 'Torranyard' could therefore be a corruption of 'Tour Inn yard.' Local people still pronounce the name 'Torranyard' as 'TOURanyard'. Jamieson records that the inn at Burnhouse was nicknamed the 'Trap 'Em Inn', the one at Lugton was called the 'Lug 'Em Inn', that at Auchentiber the 'Cleek 'Em Inn', and finally the one at Torranyard was called the 'Turn 'Em Out.'Jamieson, Page 18 =The Resurrectionists= Auchenharvie Castle in 1820 A local legend is that in the days of the 'body snatchers' or 'resurrectionists'; before the Anatomy Act of 1832, bodies obtained locally were hidden in the ruins of the nearby Auchenharvie Castle before being taken up to Glasgow at night to sell to the surgeons and medical students at the old university. Another version of the story states that the bodies were collected together from neighbouring parishes at Darnshaw, a remote house near Bloak Moss on the old Auchenharvie to Megswell toll road route.Strawhorn, Page 113.Love, Page 148 The old toll road did run past the site and a toll gate and house stood fairly close by which must cast some doubt on the castle being involved.Holder, Page 54 Jamieson records the story that tramps were lured to their deaths at the inns along this road by 'body snatchers' and as evidence it is recorded that when the Cleikum Inn at Auchentiber was demolished a large collection of walking sticks were found. Micro-history A William Forgisal (Fergushill) of Torranyard was miner at the Doura Pit in the 18th-century. He lost his leg in a mining accident, as had his father. William's wife was a tough sort, her comment being on seeing him so encumbered, was that the Forgisal's would need a small plantation of their own to keep them in crutches.Service, Page 140.

Early Years Oliver grew up with an interest in music and electronics, assembling crystal radio sets and playing guitar and bass in high school bands. In 1944, at the age of 18, he was drafted into the United States Army and assigned to an infantry radio unit, but a case of pneumonia rendered him medically unfit for combat, and he was re-assigned to play upright bass in the Army Band. After the war, Oliver took advantage of the G.I. Bill to study electronics while continuing to work as a professional musician in Queens. Ampeg Oliver visited The Ampeg Bassamp Company to buy one of Everett Hull's amplified pegs for his bass and impressed Hull so much that Hull offered him a job, but it wasn't until the summer of 1956 that Oliver left his work as an electrician to work full-time for Ampeg. Oliver's new employer paid for him to attend night classes at the RCA Institute, where he studied amplifier design and technology, and he applied that knowledge to developing new Ampeg products and improving the efficiencies of its manufacturing production lines. When Ampeg incorporated in 1959, Jess Oliver was designated Vice President. In 1960, Oliver invented and patented the B-15, a bass combo amp with closed-back reflex cabinet, double- baffle porting system, and an innovative flip-top function. The B-15 was the first in Ampeg's Portaflex series, and after becoming the preferred studio amp of session musicians like James Jamerson and Chuck Rainey, went on to become the most-recorded bass amplifier in history. By 1963, the Portaflex series business had grown to 44% of Ampeg's amplifier sales. In 1961, with the introduction of the Ampeg Reverbrocket, Oliver was the first to integrate Laurens Hammond's new spring reverb into a guitar combo amplifier. Oliver Sound Company In 1966, amidst company struggles related to growth and manufacturing, as well as disagreements with Hull, Oliver resigned from Ampeg, forming Oliver Sound Company later that year. At Oliver Sound Company, he invented and manufactured a full line of amplifiers and sound equipment, including new Powerflex amplifiers with a motorized lift platform. Eventually he scaled down manufacturing and operated Oliver Sound as an amplifier service center out of his basement in Massapequa, New York. Later Years At the 2001 NAMM Show, Ampeg awarded Oliver with \\"Godfather of Bass Amplification.\\" Oliver also served as technical advisor for the 1997 and 2010 versions of the B-15.

K. Dutta, was the president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians and thus the Indian Christian delegate to the Second Round Table Conference in London, as well as a prominent YMCA leader, and a member of Central Legislative Assembly ‚Äì also called Imperial Legislative Assembly before Indian independence ‚Äì a lower house of a bicameral parliament synonymous to the current Lok Sabha after Indian independence. Biography =Life= He was born in Lahore, colonial India, in 1878, and got educated in Lahore. He did Medicine from University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh. He married Rena Carswell, a Scottish Irish woman and secretary in the World Student Christian Federation(WSCF) in Geneva. He served as the lecturer teaching history and biology between 1909 and 1914 in Foreman Christian College, Lahore. He served as principal between 1932 and 1942, and later became the president of the same college. =YMCA leader= He succeeded K. T. Paul as general secretary of Young Men's Christian Association(YMCA) and eventually became president of the Indian YMCA. He worked as national secretary of the YMCAs of India, Burma, and Ceylon(present Sri Lanka) from 1919 to 1927. He along with K.T. Paul and V.S. Azariah were the prominent YMCA leaders, though, YMCA didn't directly involve in politics as it was run by the financial support of foreign donors beside an evangelistic agency, formed under the initiatives of missionaries; however, under the leadership of K.T. Paul and S.K. Datta, they made the YMCA known and respected not only in India but also in Europe and North America. He served as president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians in 1925, 1933, and 1934. After a lengthy service with YMCA, S.K. Datta was also associated with WSCF along with his wife Rena Datta. In June 1918, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services in the YMCA during the First World War. =National delegate= He served as a nominated[appointed] member of Central Legislative Assembly to represent Indian Christian community, before Indian independence and Indian partition, from 1924 to 1926, and gave an address at the International Missionary Council meeting held at Lake Mohonk in 1921 and Jerusalem in 1928. As an Indian Christian delegate, he attended Second Round Table Conference held in London between September to December 1931‚ÄîK.T. Paul and S.K. Dutta, though not followers of Gandhi and represented Indian christian community, they indeed made efforts to bring reconciliation among the opposing leaders who took part in the conference, including Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Muhammad Iqbal, Ghanshyam Das Birla, Mirza Ismail, and more. As an editor of YMCA's periodical The Young Men of India, he edited many articles like India and racial relationships and promoted national consciousness among the Indian Christians during the national movement. By 1930, prominent Indian christian(Protestant) leaders like V.S. Azaraih, K.T. Paul, V. Chakkarai(V. Chakka Rai), and S.K. Dutta have come to conclusions that Indian christians would best integrate themselves into national life if they didn't cast themselves as a separate political entity. They also realized that a separate Christian electorate would further alienate them from national culture and amount to a form of compulsory segregation. In 1930, All Indian Christian Council proclaimed that \\"the place of a minority in a nation is its value to the whole nation and not merely to itself.\\" In Second Round Table conference, both K.T. Paul and S.K. Datta representing Protestants took a determined stand against turning Indian Christians into a Communal political entity by Britain‚Äîimposing on them Communal representation, Communal electorate, and other Communal safeguards. A biography of S.K. Datta with name S.K. Datta and his people was published by Margarita Barns. =President of the All India Conference of Indian Christians= S.K. Datta served as the president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians, which stood for the interests of the Christian community of colonial India. He represented Indian Christians in the Second Round Table Conference, agreeing with Mahatma Gandhi in his views on minorities and Depressed Classes. Devout christian =Critic of Hinduism= He was a devout Christian and critic of Hinduism, who believed that the Indian religions do indeed search for the truth, yet argued that they didn't provide moral and spiritual support for reform and renewal. He denounced Hinduism philosophy and its doctrines, especially Karma and Transmigration in weakening the demand for moral responsibility and social reform; according to him, only the basic teachings of Christianity could give hope to the people of India‚Äîthe righteousness of God, the moral order of the created universe, the redeeming love of God manifest in Jesus Christ. He further emphasized a two-fold contribution of Christianity to India through the work of educational institutions, and through the visible Indian church, which he believed to be influential far beyond its minority status. =Critic of Western Christianity= He was cynical about Indian church for lack of spiritual depth, absence of a distinctive Indian Christian theology, and dependence on foreign leadership and money. He was even critical about the caste system operating within the Indian churches. Works * The desire of India. * The Christian Student and the Indian Church.

It is a terrestrial orchid with a tough upright, stem and stiffly spreading, elliptic to egg-shaped leaves. There is a long flowering stem with a short zig-zag section near the end where single flowers open in succession. The flowers are white with a yellow labellum.Lewis Roberts Description Bromheadia finlaysoniana is a terrestrial, evergreen herb with flattened yellowish stems long with tough, stiffly spreading elliptic to egg-shaped leaves long and wide. The flowering stems is long with a short zig-zag end where up to seventy five single white flowers open in succession. The flowers are long, wide and are pinkish on the outside. The sepals are elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide and the petals are egg-shaped and a similar length but broader than the sepals. The laballum is pale yellow, about long and wide and has three lobes, the side lobes erect. Flowering occurs between June and March in Australia and as late as October in New Guinea. Taxonomy and naming The pale reed orchid was first formally described in 1833 by John Lindley who gave it the name Grammatophyllum finlaysonianum and published the description in his book The genera and species of Orchidaceous plants. In 1859, Friedrich Miquel changed the name to Bromheadia Finlaysoniana. The specific epithet (finlaysoniana) honours George Finlayson who collected the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Bromheadia finlaysoniana has a wide distribution that includes Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, Brunei, the Moluccas, New Guinea, the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, the Anambas Islands and possibly the Philippines, although it's uncertain whether the specimens referred to the Philippines were actually collected there.

He produced portraits of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, his closest friend, and Claude Monet. Biography Born in Lyon, he initially trained there designing patterns for silk. In 1889 he moved to Paris to enroll at the Acad√©mie Julian. There he met Paul Ranson, Louis Valtat, and Georges d'Espagnat. He also associated with the group known as Les Nabis which included Bonnard, Vuillard, Denis, Vallotton, Marquet and Signac. In 1894, he exhibited five paintings at the Salon des Ind√©pendants where he caught the eye of Renoir. Despite their age difference, a solid friendship united them until Renoir's death in 1919, providing Andr√© with guidance in his career. Through Renoir's art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, Andr√© was able to sell many of his paintings in the United States through the Durand-Ruel Galleries. Between 1895 and 1901, he exhibited at the Salon des Cent, the Salon des Ind√©pendants, the Exposition d'Art Nouveau, the Salon d'Automne, and, in 1904, at the Salon de la Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels. In 1912, Durand-Ruel enabled Andr√© to exhibit his work in New York City and in 1913, he was selected to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels, showcasing works on a theme of southern France. He would later showcase his works many times in New York City, as in 1930. Portrait of Renoir by Albert Andr√© (1913) Albert Andr√©: Renoir's garden in Cagnes-sur-Mer Demobilized from World War I in 1917, he moved to Marseille and then to the village of Laudun in the Gard, where he had been on vacation since his childhood as his family owned a house there together with a small vineyard. He became curator of the art museum of Bagnols-sur-C√®ze, where he remained until his death. In 1919, he produced a monograph, \\"Renoir\\", considered to be \\"one of the most accurate contemporary accounts of the artist's work\\", and in 1921, he organized a retrospective of Renoir's work at the Durand-Ruel Gallery. He was also very close to the art critic George Besson, a friend since 1910. In 1971, Besson decided to offer his art collection to the nation, bequeathing to the museums of Besan√ßon and Bagnols- sur-C√®ze, where the museum is now called Mus√©e Albert-Andr√©. Andr√© died on 11 July 1954 at 85 years old, shortly before his works were due to be showcased at the Avignon Museum. After his death, in 1955, the Salon d‚ÄôAutomne organized a retrospective of his works. Today many of his paintings are to be found in major world museums such as the Modern Art Museum of New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, museums in Philadelphia and Washington DC, Paris's Mus√©e d'Orsay, the Galerie Rienzo, and the Mus√©e Albert-Andr√© in France.

Animal use in RTT is strictly controlled under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 and organisations using animals must follow an approved code of ethical conduct. This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its animal ethics committee (AEC). Every project must be approved and monitored by an AEC which includes lay members. The principles of the Three Rs are embodied in the Animal Welfare Act, the operation of all AECs, and all activities that involve the use of animals in research.  Introduction  In New Zealand, it is legal under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 (the Act) to use animals for research, testing and teaching (RTT) purposes. However, because the nature of this work may, in some cases, mean that potential benefits to humans, other animals or the environment may result in some harm to animals, such use carries significant responsibilities and strict legislative obligations.  Statistics  The Ministry for Primary Industries reported that 310,287 animals were used in New Zealand in 2014. The most common species used were cattle (24.3%), mice (18.8%), sheep (14.4%), fish (13.3%), birds (10.2%) and deer (8.1%). The large number of livestock used in research reflects the large amount of agricultural research conducted in New Zealand. The most common areas of research were 'Basic biological research' (24.3%), 'veterinary research' (19.2%), 'teaching' (16.9%) and 'animal husbandry' (15.4%). According to the Ministry for Primary Industries, only 24% of animals die, or are euthanised, as part of the research. 1.9% of animals used in 2014 were transgenic.  Legislation  Part 6 of the Act applies specifically to the use of animals for RTT purposes. Under the Act: * Any person or organisation wishing to manipulate animals for RTT purposes must do so under a Code of Ethical Conduct (CEC) approved by the Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), and must establish an animal ethics committee (AEC) to oversee the use of animals within the institution. * The CEC sets out the policies and procedures to ensure that its AEC can operate effectively and that the organisation can meet its obligations under the Act. * The membership of the AEC is set within the legislation and must include three members whose independence from the organisation adds credibility and transparency to the AEC‚Äôs activities. These include: :* a nominee of an approved animal welfare organisation (such as the SPCA); :* a nominee of the New Zealand Veterinary Association; and :* a layperson to represent the public interest and who is nominated by a local government body. * Animal ethics committees monitor researchers and the animal use that they have approved. * Organisations using animals for RTT must undergo an independent audit at a maximum of every five years to ensure compliance with the Act and with their own CEC. * Records must be kept for all animals used for the purposes of RTT for five years. Code holders are required to submit an annual return, which includes the number of animals used and the impact on their welfare. The statistics supplied to MPI are published each year as an appendix to the National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC) annual report.  The Three Rs  The Three Rs ‚Äì Replacement, Reduction and Refinement ‚Äì relate to the ethical use of animals in RTT. * Replacement - wherever possible, animals should be replaced with non-animal alternatives e.g. computer modelling. * Reduction ‚Äì numbers of animals should be the minimum necessary to achieve a meaningful result. * Refinement - pain and distress should be reduced as much as possible e.g. by using painkillers, by ensuring appropriate housing or by ensuring the skill of those involved in the use and care of animals. The importance of the Three Rs is demonstrated by the New Zealand Three Rs Programme, a collaboration between the Massey University Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre, MPI, the Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART) and NAEAC. The key aims of the Programme are: * to promote understanding and application of the Three Rs in New Zealand; * to encourage new Three Rs strategies in New Zealand; * to profile New Zealand‚Äôs Three Rs contributions nationally and internationally * to network and liaise with other Three Rs centres internationally The Three Rs have been incorporated into New Zealand‚Äôs legislation as can be seen in the following section on AEC considerations.  Animal ethics committees  The legislation requires that AEC members consider any RTT project using animals. Their questions must include the following: * Are the scientific or educational objectives credible? * What is the potential harm to the animals and how can it be minimised (refinement)? * Is the experimental design credible? * Are animals necessary and, if so, is the choice of species appropriate (replacement)? * Can a less sentient species be used? * Are the animal numbers the minimum necessary to get a meaningful result (reduction)? * What procedures are in place to care for the animals (refinement)? * Are those involved in the project suitably qualified (refinement)? * What measures have been taken to ensure that experimental work is not being duplicated (reduction)? In considering projects, AECs may approve the work, they may require certain conditions to be put in place before approval is granted, or they may reject the proposal. They are also required to monitor compliance with any approved project, and can suspend or revoke the approval if necessary.  The National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee  The National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC) is an independent committee whose membership includes animal welfare experts, veterinarians, scientists and lay people. It provides independent, expert advice to the Minister for Primary Industries on policy and practices relating to the use of animals in RTT. The committee also provides advice and support to AECs to maximise good decision-making. Assistance is provided in the following ways: * AEC workshops; * provision of induction packs for new AEC members; * publication of policies and procedures; * distribution of newsletters; * response to queries from AECs; * publication of an ‚Äòoccasional paper‚Äô series on issues of importance to AECs; * visits to regional AECs. NAEAC also presents an annual \\"Three Rs Award\\" which recognises achievement in implementation of the Three Rs by an individual or organisation.

It has a dense crown, smooth, satin-like bark, glossy green, linear leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus spathulata is a low-branching mallet with a dense crown that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. The trunk usually has a diameter of but can be even larger for older trees, and it is usually relatively short, sometimes fluted at the base. The bark is smooth, satin- like, greyish brown or reddish brown on the trunk and branches. Young plants have linear leaves that are long and wide and sessile or have a short petiole. Adult leaves are linear, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three or seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a horn-shaped or conical operculum two or three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus spathulata was formally described in 1844 by botanist William Jackson Hooker in his book Icones Plantarum, from specimens collected near the Swan River by James Drummond. The specific epithet (spathulata) is from the Latin word spathulatus, meaning spoon-like or a broad rounded upper part tapering gradually downward into a stalk. Why the name was chosen is unknown. Two subspecies are recognised by the Australian Plant Census: *E. spathulata subsp. salina D.Nicolle & Brooker is distinguished from the autonym by its larger fruit ( x ); *E. spathulata Hook. subsp. spathulata has smaller fruit than subspecies spathulata ( x ). Distribution and habitat Swamp mallet is found on flats, broad valley floors, on rises, in and around saline depressions and along the edges of salt lakes in the southern Wheatbelt and inland Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it grows in sandy or sandy-clay soils over granite. Subspecies spathulata is found in the Blackwood River and Pallinup River drainage systems. Subspecies salina is restricted to the more northerly Salt River catchment. The species grows in woodland communities with an understorey that contains a variety of melaleuca species including M. acuminata, M. pauperiflora, M. lateriflora, M. brophyi and M. uncinata group. Other associated species include Bossiaea halophila, Gahnia ancistrophylla and Brachyscome lineariloba, all well suited to calcareous, saline low-lying areas. Conservation status Subspecies spathulata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, but subspecies salina is listed as \\"Priority Three\\", meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture Eucalyptus spathulata has a high to moderate growth rate and can live to over 15 years. It is widely cultivated in southern Australia and can be grown in saline and poorly drained situations. The tree's wood is dense, hard and pale brown in colour and can be used as a source of fuelwood and craftwood. It is planted in gardens as an ornamental and as a windbreak, and produces pollen desirable for apiculture. The bark is rich in tannin and the leaves contain cineole. The tree is both drought and frost tolerant and can withstand salt laden winds. The tree has also been cultivated in California.

This irredentism can be regarded as an early form of Pan-Africanism, albeit strictly limited to White Africans of European ancestry.Schwarz 2012, p. 301 Theoretical planning Map shows the location of River Zambesi, the hypothetical border river of an enlarged South African state. Statesman Jan Smuts repeatedly had called for South African expansion since 1895, envisioning a future South African border along the river Zambesi or even the equator.Hyam & Henshaw 2003, p. 103 German South-West Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and at least the southern parts of Portuguese Mozambique (especially the port of Louren√ßo Marques in the Delagoa Bay) along with the High Commission Territories (Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland, the last one having been a Transvaal protectorate from 1890‚Äì99) were to be included in this state, with Pretoria now being its geographical capital. Although the initial objective of Smuts' expansion plan was the Zambesi, he took great geopolitical interest in the East Africa Protectorate and Tanganyika: he was impressed with the British colonists of the White Highlands and believed that the area could be transformed into a \\"great European state or system of states\\" in the near future, eventually leading to a \\"chain of white states which will in the end become one from the Union to Kenya\\".Hyam & Henshaw 2003, pp. 103‚Äì105 Smuts believed this expansion would finally lead South Africa to become \\"one of the greatest future Dominions of the Empire\\", the equal of Australia and Canada. Smuts' expansionist aims received little domestic white support.Nolutshungu 1975, p. 33 Afrikaner nationalists feared that the incorporation of British territories near South Africa would result in a state with a much larger black majority than in the then-current Union of South Africa. Actualization The formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 was seen as the first step in bringing about the unification of the British-held territories in Southern Africa.Hyam & Henshaw 2003, p. 102 The British initially supported the territorial enlargement of the South African State. Neither the British nor the South Africans expected London's continuing imperial responsibility for Rhodesia, Nyasaland and the High Commission Territories to be the ultimate territorial arrangement: the South Africa Act 1909 made provisions for admitting Rhodesia as a fifth province of the Union in the future, and laid out the terms for the potential future transfer of the High Commission Territories. Prime Minister Louis Botha agreed with Smuts that the South African annexation of the High Commission Territories was only a matter of time.Schwarz 2012, p. 302 The British approved Smuts' war aims during the South-West Africa Campaign of 1914-1915, and supported the mandation of German South-West Africa to South Africa in 1919, although Smuts looked to formally incorporating the territory.Hyam & Henshaw 2003, p. 110 He suggested naming this new territory Bothaland after the Prime Minister.Hayes 1998, p. 46 Even future fulfilment of the territorial objects in Portuguese Mozambique ‚Äì by the means of a purchase approved unanimously by the South African cabinet ‚Äì were looked upon favorably, despite Portugal being a member of the Entente. However, the Southern Rhodesian government referendum of 1922 saw the colony of Southern Rhodesia reject joining the Union. This decision made the South African acquisition of the British South African Company rights in Bechuanaland unnecessary, and thus its transfer to the Union was halted. Rhodesia, functioning as a British counterweight to Afrikaner dominance, had laid claims to at least a part of Bechuanaland, and thus it was increasingly in British interests to transfer the latter from the South African sphere of influence.Hyam & Henshaw 2003, pp. 110‚Äì111 The British were also disappointed with the South African parliament passing the Natives Land Act, which created the land tenure system which eventually became one of the foundations of Apartheid.Hyam 2010, p. 349 Without Rhodesia, Smuts' projections for further South African expansion northward became impossible to actualize and his aspirations towards Mozambique difficult to accomplish.Hyam & Henshaw 2003, p. 111 The South African general election of 1924 brought the end of Smuts' premiership and the election of J. B. M. Hertzog as the new Prime Minister.Hyam & Henshaw 2003, p. 112 The British were suspicious of the anti- imperial and pro-Afrikaner Hertzog compared to the anglophile Smuts, and became less willing to meet South African territorial demands. In the Afrikaner-dominated Apartheid South Africa (1948-1994), especially under the premiership of Hendrik Verwoerd (in office 1958-1966), the concept of an incorporation of Southern African territories into a white-dominated South Africa revived, aiming now at Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland which became independent from the United Kingdom in 1966-1968.

He was the head of the Cabinet and led the various administrative branches and supervision and appointment rights in the name of the monarch of the other ministers of state. The literal translation of the Korean name for the office is Prime Minister of the Cabinet of the Korean Empire.  History  Prior to the adoption of the modern constitution, Korea had in practice no written constitution. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system was enacted. It described a government based on an elaborate and rational meritocratic bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the monarch. Under this system, the yeonguijeong, or chief state councillor, was the head of the State Council, the highest organ of Korea's pre-modern royal government during the Joseon era and until briefly under the Korean Empire. The office was replaced with the appointment of Kim Hong Jip (previously the last Yeonguijeong) to the new position of Prime Minister in 1895 with the Gabo Reform. With the annexation of Korea to the Empire of Japan the office came to an end. During the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Exile in Shanghai, China, a prime minister position was recreated for a brief few days for Syngman Rhee to replace the chairman of the Provisional Legislative Assembly. The role was changed over to Chief Executive in 1919, changed again as Premier 1919-1926 and finally as President from 1926‚Äì1948.

The trial was one of the longest in Australian legal history. The men appealed their convictions and sentences but lost. Media investigations undertaken since the trial by news program by a number of well- known investigative journalists including the ABC's 'Four Corners' program and 'The Sydney Morning Herald', suggested most of the evidence on which the six were charged was fabricated and that the men were set up as part a sting operation by the Yugoslav foreign intelligence service, 'UDBA'. Intelligence sources later indicated that Dr Georgi Trajkovski, the Yugoslav Consul General in Melbourne, was an UDBA operative and a key player in the Croatian Six set up. The case also drew attention from John Schindler, then at the US Naval War College, who claimed that the 'Croatian Six' was 'a \\"classic\\" agent provocateur operation run by the intelligence agency of the then communist regime in Belgrade, known as the UDBA, against exile communities that were against the Yugoslavian federation.' He also claimed that former UDBA officials said that the Croatian Six case was \\"one of their great successes\\" in completely discrediting the Croatian Australian community. According to Schindler, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation would have (or at least should have) been aware of UDBA's involvement. Ian Cunliffe, formerly a senior lawyer in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, claimed intelligence material was withheld that would have resulted in not guilty verdicts for the Croatian Six. This material was purposely kept from then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and subpoenas by defence lawyers in the trial were not allowed on \\"national security grounds\\". In 2012, three of the surviving five men ‚Äî Max Bebic, Mile Nekic and Vic Brajkovic ‚Äî represented by human rights lawyer Sebastian De Brennan, applied to the NSW Supreme Court for a judicial review of their convictions.

It is not written in a Geordie dialect, but has a strong Northern connection. For centuries, the Government Clergy (i.e. Rector, vicar, or perpetual curate etc.) had the right to collect from each household in a Parish, ‚ÄúEaster Dues‚Äù. This was based on a set sum (in the early/middle nineteenth century it was at the rate of 4p per person), and the head of the household had the duty to pay this sum on behalf of every member resident in the property of the age of 16 or more. Peter Watson objected to this compulsory payment reasoning that ‚Äúthe claims were founded neither in the law or in the gospels‚Äù, and was duly summons (and jailed for a short time for non-payment) before the court judged that the collection of these under the Acts of William III were illegal, ruling that \\"This act, or anything herein contained, shall not extend to any tythes, offerings, payments or oblations shall not extend‚Ä¶.. ‚Ä¶within any city or town where the same are settled by Act of Parliament\\" It is therefore the British public who are indebted to him for the removal of this \\"odious, unjust and oppressive clerical tax\\".

It describes itself as \\"the first and only museum dedicated to potato fries\\". History The museum was founded in 2008 by Eddy Van Belle, who had previously opened two other museums in Bruges, both based in one building: Choco-Story, which is dedicated to Belgium's chocolate industry, and Lumina Domestica, which houses Van Belle's 6,500-piece collection of lamps. Inspired by the popularity of Choco-Story, Van Belle had researched the possibility of a museum dedicated to fries, and was encouraged to open the Frietmuseum after discovering that no similar museum existed elsewhere. Description The entrance to the museum The Frietmuseum is located in the Gothic Saaihalle (former wool hall) at Vlamingstraat 33. This is one of the oldest buildings in the World Heritage listed historic centre of Bruges and dates back to 1399, with an annexe added shortly afterwards. Throughout the fifteenth century, this building was used as a base for the activities of Genoese merchants. Prior to the museum's opening, it underwent a year and a half of renovation work, including restoration of the fa√ßade. During this work, no structural changes were made to the interior of the building. The museum is spread across three floors. Exhibits on the ground floor trace the history of potatoes, beginning in Peru c.8000BC. The first floor details the history of fries, and their origins in Belgium. The basement of the building houses a cafe. Exhibits include photographs, artwork, historical potato peelers and chip-making machines, and a video outlining how to make perfect fries. Building The building is housed in the Gothic Saaihalle (former wool hall). The building dates back to 1399, was extended as the residence of the Consul of Genoa in 1441, used by weavers from 1578-1750, and has since served variously as an inn, caf√©, cinema, dancehall, and since 1978 as a bank and exhibition space.

History Royal Queensland Aero Club Beechcraft 76 Duchess Cessna 172N Skyhawk II Originally known as the Australian Aero Club (Queensland Section), RQAC was founded in 1910, page 72. making it the oldest aviation organisation in the southern hemisphere. Flight training commenced in 1919 after World War I, the organisation was renamed the Queensland Aero Club in 1920 and received approval from the government to commence passenger services later that year, earlier than Qantas. The Aero Club had close ties with Qantas as their flight training provider, a partnership that exists to this day, through the Airline Academy of Australia, a subsidiary of the Royal Queensland Aero Club specialising in training airline cadets. The organisation was granted the 'Royal' prefix in 1935 and became the Royal Queensland Aero Club. page 304 RQAC civil operations ceased in 1940 at the dawn of World War II with the assets being seconded to the Royal Australian Air Force No. 2 Empire Flight Training School.

They take the form of the following differential equations: {d{I_{1z}} \\\\over dt}=-R_z^1(I_{1z}-I_{1z}^0)-\\\\sigma_{12}(I_{2z}-I_{2z}^0) {d{I_{2z}} \\\\over dt}=-R_z^2(I_{2z}-I_{2z}^0)-\\\\sigma_{12}(I_{1z}-I_{1z}^0) {d{I_{1z}I_{2z}} \\\\over dt}=-R_z^{12}2I_{1z}I_{2z} These equations, so named after physicist , describe how the population of the different spin states changes in relation to the strength of the self-relaxation rate constant R and \\\\sigma_{12}, which accounts instead for cross-relaxation. The latter is the important term which is responsible for transferring magnetization from one spin to the other and gives rise to the nuclear Overhauser effect. In an NOE experiment, the magnetization on one of the spins, say spin 2, is reversed by applying a selective pulse sequence. At short times then, the resulting magnetization on spin 1 will be given by {d{I_{1z}} \\\\over dt}=-R_z^1(I_{1z}^0-I_{1z}^0)-\\\\sigma_{12}(-I_{2z}^0-I_{2z}^0)=2\\\\sigma_{12}I_{2z}^0 since there is no time for a significant change in the populations of the energy levels. Integrating with respect to time gives: I_{1z}(t)=2\\\\sigma_{12}tI_{2z}^0+I_{1z}^0 which results in an enhancement of the signal of spin 1 on the spectrum. Typically, another spectrum is recorded without applying the reversal of magnetization on spin 2 and the signals from the two experiments are then subtracted. In the final spectrum, only peaks which have an nOe enhancement show up, demonstrating which spins are in spatial proximity in the molecule under study: only those will in fact have a significant \\\\sigma_{12} cross relaxation factor.

(Edward) Dewar (8 June 1891 ‚Äì 8 December 1969) was a New Zealand poet, writer, teacher, farmer, worker and First World War soldier. Best remembered for his 1953 autobiographical book ChaslandsWaimate Daily Advertiser, 11 December 1969 about the early pioneering days there, he also wrote poetry on sport and his experiences as a First World War soldier and contributed widely to newspapers.  Life  George Dewar was born in Christchurch on 8 June 1891. He was the son of Thomas Dewar, a state farmer and labourer, and Elizabeth Dewar; both were natives of Scotland. His birth was registered as George Edward Smith, fourth child of David Smith and Elizabeth Smith. This is because his father (Thomas Dewar) had married his mother in Scotland using the fictitious name David Smith and the couple had departed soon after the marriage to New Zealand. The family subsequently resumed the real name of Dewar Early in his life, he moved to Chaslands in the Owaka district of the South Island, where he grew up. An early mention of George appears in the Otago Witness newspaper delivering an epilogue at the conclusion of a school concert.Otago Witness, 21 October 1903 Chaslands was a small town with around 150 people in the 1900s. There was milling and a cheese factory. The local school opened in 1895 with two teachers. Living conditions were poor and difficult for the sick or injured. David McGill notes these facts in his Ghost Towns of New Zealand (1980) and notes further: ‚ÄòThe isolated region grew intrepid men like George Dewar‚Äôs brother, Tom, who crossed the Andes on foot.‚ÄôDavid McGill, Ghost Towns of New Zealand (Wellington: A.H. & A.W. Reed, 1980), p. 192 At Chaslands, Dewar worked at various jobs, including bush work; sawmill work; and railway line construction.Clutha Leader, 16 February 1970 His military call up was in 1916 while he was working on a farm in Tuatapere (New Zealand Gazette, 23 November 1916, No. 132, p. 3682). During the First World War, he served overseas in the NZEF along with his brother David. David was killed in France on 1 October 1918.World War I Guide, Hocken Collections, Hocken Library, University of Otago George's embarkation unit was 23rd Reinforcements Otago Infantry Regiment, D Company. He served with C Company, 3rd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade. Wounded in action, Dewar spent time interned in a German Prisoner of War camp.Auckland War Memorial Museum, Cenotaph database Repatriated after the Armistice, Dewar returned to the South Island to take further education through correspondence in Dunedin and Alexandra towards his Teacher's Certificate, following which he worked as a sole charge teacher and a head teacher at primary schools including Lower Harbour School (Deborah Bay, Otago), Hamama School, (Nelson), Owaka Valley School (South Otago), and Ratanui School (Otago) from 1921‚Äì1936.Who's Who in New Zealand, 1964 Dewar married Matilda Dewar (n√©e McGimpsey) on 11 May 1932 and the couple had three sons: Robert Dewar, David Dewar and Allan Dewar. In 1937, he took up small farming at Clinton before moving to Waimate in 1943. Dewar worked as a rabbiter and did farm work in the Waimate district. He was known as a keen Toc H worker and studied nature.Waimate Daily Advertiser, 11 December 1969 During World War II, Dewar was appointed Lieutenant, Home Guard (New Zealand Gazette, 18 June 1942, No. 60, p. 1633). Dewar was interested in sports like cricket and rugby and was an expert on bird-life. As a young man, Dewar played rugby for the Chaslands football team.McGill, p. 192 He was also interested in the formation of the Catlins Historical Society and wrote giving recollections of visits to Cathedral Caves and Waipati Beach.Clutha Leader, 16 February 1970 Dewar died in Waimate where he spent his retirement years on 8 December 1969. He was 78 years old; however, library catalogues give his birth date as 1895. A number of obituaries for Dewar appeared after his death in the Clutha Leader, Waimate Daily Advertiser, Timaru Herald and Christchurch Star. These obituaries give his birth date as 1891. The NZ Biographies Index at the National Library of New Zealand also notes him. Who's Who in New Zealand (1964) gives his birth date as 8 June 1895.  Literary output  Dewar was known as a prodigious contributor of articles to newspapers, including the Waimate Daily Advertiser, had stories in New Zealand Outdoors magazine, and also wrote many poems, most relating to bird-life.Waimate Daily Advertiser, 11 December 1969 During the First World War, he wrote on his experiences in verse. The Hocken Collections in Dunedin, New Zealand holds the Dewar family papers relating to World War I. Dewar published only two books in his lifetime: Song of the Lowburn Punt and Other Verses (1944) and Chaslands (1953). Chaslands is an autobiographical account of his early pioneering days there. It also includes stories of gold mining on the beaches.Waimate Daily Advertiser, 11 December 1969 David McGill writes: ‚ÄòGeorge Dewar has written the Chaslands‚Äô story from its heyday, in the 1890s to its lowdays in the 1950s ‚Äì stories of lobster feasts, of eel for breakfast, dinner and tea, of mud up to your neck, the awesome chopping of the Browdens and Jack Churchfield, and the midwife Mrs Churchfield, who always knew the sex and time of birth, something medical science has not yet bettered.‚ÄôMcGill, p. 192 Noel Hoggard‚Äôs Handcraft Press in Wellington printed Dewar's 16-poem collection (a 26-page booklet); however, it is not in obituaries for Dewar. Hoggard also produced the literary magazine Arena. A publisher's note describes The Song of the Lowburn Punt as 'a token of remembrance' for Dewar's time spent teaching in Otago and Nelson districts. The poems are a mixture of popular lyrics and ballads of those areas, including simple celebrations of bird-life (the bellbirds at Chaslands), and places such as the Otago hills, Waipouri and Hamama. In 1976‚Äì77, Dewar's wife Matilda Dewar contributed George's material and her own to Radio New Zealand's's Wartime Stories concerning World War I.

The station is part of the Main-Lahn Railway. It is at the beginning of the western approach to Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof, which runs for about five kilometres and is up to 600 metres wide. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. Today it is served only by lines S1 and S 2 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. History The station was built in 1877 by the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) along with the Main-Lahn railway to the north of the town centre of Griesheim. The current station building was built in 1968. The station is now served only by S-Bahn lines S1 (Wiesbaden‚ÄìR√∂dermark-Ober-Roden) and S2 (Niedernhausen‚ÄìDietzenbach). The station has an island platform and a side platform, three platform tracks altogether. Just east of the station, the Frankfurt City Link Line (St√§dtische Verbindungsbahn) branches to the south- east to the East Harbour (Osthafen). Freight and passenger trains are operated on the line by HFM Managementgesellschaft f√ºr Hafen und Markt mbH (\\"HFM Management Company for the Port and Market\\") and passenger trains are sometimes operated by the Historischen Eisenbahn Frankfurt (\\"Historic Railway, Frankfurt\\", CEF), using steam and diesel locomotives and railbuses. From 1930 until the start of the operations of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn in 1978, the station was also a stop on tram line 14. Location The station is now in the centre of Griesheim, the largest district in the western part of Frankfurt, between the Main and the Mainzer Landstra√üe. South of it is the historic heart of Griesheim, north of it are new estates built in the mid-20th century. The two districts are connected by a bridge to the east and a level crossing to the west. On the opposite side of the adjacent Autogenstra√üe (street) there are buildings from the period of the station's construction. Some residences have been built recently at the station after Deutsche Bahn removed several sidings. Operations Griesheim is on timetable (KBS) route 627 (Main-Lahn Railway). The regional and long distance traffic uses the parallel Taunus Railway (KBS 645.1), but, during disruptions on that line, traffic can be rerouted over the Griesheim route. The two lines separate west of Frankfurt station and rejoin east of Frankfurt H√∂chst station. To the east of the passenger station is Griesheim depot, which was formerly operated by the Rhine-Main S-Bahn with a carriage shed, carriage washing facilities and workshops. With the transfer of this facility to the former post office station (Postbahnhof) near Frankfurt Galluswarte station, Griesheim depot is now used for the maintenance of ICE 3M and ICE T sets. The line is now controlled from the Frankfurt signalling centre. The old Griesheim pushbutton signal box on platform 1 is now used as an operations room.

It forms part of procedural or adjectival law, and describes the means by which its substantive counterpart, South African criminal law, is applied. It has its basis mainly in English law.  History  When the British occupied the Cape permanently in 1806, they retained the Roman-Dutch legal system. They concluded, however, that the criminal justice system was archaic, and so introduced one based on their own in 1828. It has been developed over the years to suit local conditions. The South African system today is basically accusatorial: that is, the state accuses and the accused defends. The accusation and its proof are state-driven, with a state- appointed prosecuting authority.  Sources  The sources of South African criminal procedure lie in the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA), other statute law (for example, the Magistrates' Courts Act, the Supreme Court Act and the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act) and the common law. Criminal procedure overlaps with other branches of the law, like the law of evidenceSee Chapter 24 of the Criminal Procedure Act. and the substantive law.See, for example, the Criminal Procedure Act, s 49.  Stages  Criminal procedure can be divided into three stages or phrases, namely pre-trial, trial and post- trial. These divisions are not absolutely watertight.  Child Justice Act  The Child Justice Act,Act 75 of 2008 in operation since April 2010, has introduced numerous changes to criminal procedure insofar as it affects minors (persons under the age of eighteen). It involves a two-stage trial procedure in a special child justice court.  Methods of getting an accused to court  The CPA lists four methods of securing the attendance of an accused person in court.s 38. These bear an important relationship to the constitutional rights of freedom and security of the person,s 12. of freedom of movement and residence,s 21. of access to the courtss 34. and of \\"arrested, detained and accused persons.\\"s 35. The methods are as follows: # arrest; # summons (for lower courts only); # written notice in terms of section 56 of the CPA (for magistrates' courts only); and # indictment (for the High Court only). The basic principle of South African criminal procedure is that of access to courts, in accordance with section 34 of the Constitution. There is no general provision for trial in absentia. = Arrest = The manner in which arrests are to be carried out is dealt with in section 39(1) of the Act, which provides that arrests may be effected with or without warrant, and which envisages three scenarios: * that the arrestee will submit to custody; * that he must have his body touched by the arrestor; or * that, if need be, his body must be forcibly confined. He is then to be informed of the cause of the arrest or, in case of an arrest with a warrant, to be given on demand a copy of the warrant.s 39(2). The effect of the arrest is that the arrestee is in lawful custody.s 39(3). It is very important that the arrest be effected lawfully. If the arrest is not lawful, resistance or escape by the arrestee will not be unlawful, and the arrestor will have committed an assault.S v Reabow 2007 (2) SACR 292 (E).Sydney v Minister of Safety & Security ECG (CA 115/2009) (Judgment 19 March 2009). Furthermore, subsequent detention would also be unlawful, with the possibility of civil damages.Minister of Law and Order, Kwandebele v Mathebe 1990 (1) SA 114 (A) 122D. The ensuing trial, however, would not automatically be invalid.National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Another v Minister of Justice and Others 1999 (1) SA 6 (CC).R v Jones 1952 (1) SA 327 (E). Male inhabitants of South Africa, between the ages of sixteen and sixty, are obliged to assist with the arrest if called upon to do so by a police official.s 47. Failure to comply with such a request without lawful cause attracts criminal liability. Anyone who may lawfully arrest a person and who knows or reasonably suspects that person to be on certain premises may, after audibly demanding access, giving reasons, if necessary break open and enter to search and arrest the suspect.s 48.  Warrant  = Without warrant = Peace officers‚Äîthat is to say, police officials and other empowered officials‚Äîmay arrest without a warrant in the circumstances set out in section 40. The most important of these circumstances are * when any person commits or attempts to commit an offence in the presence of that peace officer; * when the peace officer reasonably suspects any person of having committed a Schedule 1 offence (other than the offence of escaping from lawful custody); * when any person has escaped or attempts to escape from lawful custody. As to \\"reasonable suspicion,\\" the most important case is Duncan v Minister of Law and Order,1984 (3) SA 460 (T). along with Ralekwa v Minister of Safety and Security,2004 (1) SACR 131 (T). S v Reabow2007 (2) SACR 292 (E). and, more generally, Ramphal v Minister of Safety and Security.2009 (1) SACR 211 (E). The peace officer may call on the person whom he has the power to arrest, or whom he reasonably suspects of having committed or attempted to commit any offence, or whom, in the opinion of the peace officer, may be able to give evidence of the offence or suspected offence, to furnish his full name and address.s 41 (1). Failure to comply with such a request constitutes an offence.s 41 (2). Private persons may arrest without warrant in the circumstances set out in section 42. The following are the most important of those types of person whom private persons may arrest without a warrant: * any person who commits or attempts to commit a Schedule 1 offence in his presence, or whom he reasonably suspects of having committed a Schedule 1 offence;s 42(1)(a). * any person whom he reasonably believes ** to have committed any offence; ** to be escaping from a person whom he reasonably believes to have the authority to arrest that person for that offence; and ** to be freshly pursued by that person;s 42(1)(b). and * any person found committing an offence on property owned or lawfully occupied by the private person.s 42(3). As to the question of whether a person who is otherwise entitled to arrest without warrant is obliged to consider whether a less invasive method would suffice to secure the attendance of the accused before court, previously the Appellate Division held that such a person could do so even if there was available a satisfactory but less invasive method of securing attendance. In S v Tsotsi,2004 (2) SACR 273 (E). the court held that such an arrest is unlawful if its objective is to frighten and harass the arrested person to stop a particular conduct rather to bring him to court for trial. It was recently held that this is no longer the position, and that now the potential arrestor must also consider whether arresting the suspect would be reasonable in the circumstances,Louw v Minister of Safety and Security 2006 (2) SACR 178 (T).Gellman v Minister of Safety and Security 2008 (1) SACR 446 (W).Charles v Minister of Safety and Security 2007 (2) SACR 137 (W).Olivier v Minister of Safety and Security 2008 (2) SACR 387 (W). but the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has since differed from this line of case law, effectively reinstating Tsotsi. = With warrant = A magistrate or justice of peace may issue a warrant of arrest on written application of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), a public prosecutor or a commissioned police officer (from the rank of captain upwards).s 43(1). The application must * set out the alleged offence;s 43(1)(a). * allege either that the offence was committed within the area of jurisdiction of the magistrate or justice of the peace, or that the person to be arrested is known or reasonably believed to be within that area of jurisdiction;s 43(1)(b). and * state that, from information on oath, there is a reasonable suspicion that the person sought has committed the alleged offence.s 43(1)(c). Warrants are executed by peace officers.s 44. Telegraphic or similar written or printed communication from the magistrate or justice of peace, stating that the warrant has been issued, is sufficient to authorise the peace officer to effect the arrest.s 45.  After arrest  After arrest, the arrestee is to be brought to the police station.s 50(1)(a). As soon as possible thereafter, the arrestee must be informed of his right to institute bail proceedings.s 50(1)(b). If an arrestee is not released, he must be brought before a lower court as soon as reasonably possible, but not later than 48 hours after the arrest. The period of 48 hours may be extended in the following circumstances:s 50(1)(d). * If it expires after normal court hours, or on a day which is not an ordinary court day, the period expires at 16:00 on the next court day thereafter. * If the arrestee's physical condition does not permit a court appearance, the court may, on application of the prosecutor, supported by a medical certificate, authorise detention of the arrestee at a specified place (such as a hospital) for the purpose of recuperation. * If an arrestee is in transit to the court from an area outside the court's jurisdiction, the period expires at 16:00 on the day following that on which he is brought within the court's area of jurisdiction. The Constitution enshrines this principle.s 35(1)(d). The term \\"normal court day\\" does not cover the situation of periodical courts, which do not sit daily. Authorities are not entitled to keep the arrestee in custody pending the next sitting of a periodical court, if that would mean a longer delay than that permitted in the case of ordinary courts sitting each weekday.Sias v Minister of Law and Order 1991 (1) SACR 420 (E). In such a case, the police would have to take the arrestee to the main court of the district for his first court appearance. If officials detain a person without lawful authority, the detainee, or someone on his behalf, may bring an interdictum de homine libero exhibendo application, which is a special type of mandamus, to compel his release. In England, this is referred to as a habeas corpus application; that term, indeed, is sometimes used in South African law.Ganyile v Minister of Justice 1962 (1) SA 647 (E).  Bail  The purpose of bail is to minimise the impact on an accused's freedom at a stage when he has not yet been convicted.Minister van Wet en Orde en ander v Dipper 1993 (3) SA 591 (A). Bail is governed by Chapter 9, a \\"complex and interlocking mechanism,\\"S v Dlamini; S v Diadla and Others; S v Joubert; S v Schietekat 1999 (2) SACR 51 (CC). of the CPA. As to the question of whether a High Court has inherent power to grant bail, or whether bail release powers are only to be found explicitly in statute, earlier cases inclined to the view that a High Court did not have inherent power to release on bail if a statute law did not give it express power.S v Kaplan 1967 (1) SA 634 (T).Chunilall v Attorney-General, Natal 1979 (1) SA 236 (D). More recently the courts have inclined to the view that they do have an inherent, common-law power to release a person on bail even if there is no statutory provision permitting it.S v Hlongwane 1989 (4) SA 79 (T).S v Hattingh 1992 (2) SACR 466 (N).S v Malcolm 1999 (1) SACR 49 (SEC).S v Tsotsi. Bail applications are always matters of urgency.Magistrate Stutterheim v Mashiya 2003 (2) SACR 106 SCA. Bail (or the refusal thereof) is entirely non- penal in character: Its refusal may not serve as a punishment; nor may a court fix an excessive amount or onerous conditions, in a bid to harass the accused. It is not anticipatory punishment.S v Acheson 1991 (2) SA 805 (Nm). When considering bail applications, the courts should ignore improper pressure: for example, the threat that the accused will go on hunger strike if bail is refused,Veenendal v Minister of Justice 1993 (1) SACR 154 (T). or that people opposed to bail will resort to illegal activity if bail is granted. The rules of evidence for the purpose of bail are relaxed.S v Dlamini; S v Diadla and Others; S v Joubert; S v Schietekat 1999 (2) SACR 51 (CC). The nature of bail, according to the CPA,s 58. is that of a contract between the accused and the state, whereby the accused is to be released from custody upon payment of an amount fixed, or upon the furnishing of an acceptable guarantee,s 60(13). and whereby, in turn, the accused is to appear at the date and place which has been appointed for the trial or to which proceedings have been adjourned. His release is to endure until the verdict, not until the sentence, unless the court upon verdict decides to extend bail. The accused must comply with the conditions set out in sections 60(12), 62 and 63 of the Act. In terms of section 59 of the CPA, a police official of the rank of sergeant or higher may fix bail before the first court appearance if the offence for which the accused is in custody does not fall under Part II or Part III of a Schedule 2 offence: that is to say, where the offence is generally of a less serious nature. In terms of section 59A, the DPP, or a prosecutor authorised by the DPP, may authorise the release of a person on bail before his first court appearance if the accused is in custody on a Schedule 7 offence. A Schedule 7 offence is generally slightly more serious than that for which police may fix bail under section 59: for example, culpable homicide, assault, grievous bodily harm, robbery, theft and fraud (where the amount involved does not exceed R20,000) and possession of drugs. It is a general principle that the accused is entitled to be released on bail at any stage prior to his conviction if the court is satisfied that the interests of justice so permit. This principle, enshrined in the Constitution,s 35(1)(f). is restated in the CPA.s 60(1)(a). Bail lapses on conviction, unless specifically extended.s 58. The court must raise the issue of bail if it has not already been raised by the prosecutor or by the accused.s 60(1)(c). The following are the general powers or duties of the court at bail hearings: * to postpone proceedings if necessary;s 60(2)(a). * to acquire the information needed for a decision in an informal manner, if the prosecutor and the accused do not dispute this;s 60(2)(b). * to require the prosecutor or the accused to lead evidence of matters in dispute;s 60(2)(c). * to require (which is mandatory) that the prosecutor place reasons on the record if he does not oppose bail on a charge of a Schedule 5 or 6 offence;s 60(2)(d). and * to order that further evidence or information be placed before the court if such is necessary for it to reach decision.s 60(3). The court is required first to consider, in principle, whether or not bail should be granted, and then to enquire into a suitable amount of money in view of the accused's circumstances.s 60(2B). During the enquiry, the accused may supply evidence by affidavit instead of giving oral evidence, although affidavit evidence carries less weight than oral evidence.S v Mathebula 2010 (1) SACR 55 (SCA). = When the interests of justice do not permit release on bail = Sometimes the interests of justice do not permit release on bail.s 60(4). Overall, in weighing up whether the interests of justice favour release or otherwise, the court has regard to the interests of justice as against the rights of the accused, and the prejudice the accused is likely to suffer if not released. The following factors can be relevant: * the accused's period already in custody since his arrest; * the probable period of detention until the disposal of the case if there is no release; * the reason for delay, and whether the fault is the accused's; * the financial loss the accused may suffer on account of his detention; * any impediment to the defence which detention may cause; * the accused's health; and * any other factor.s 60(9). S v Acheson is of general interest in this regard.  Public or individual safety  In considering whether or not there is a likelihood that the accused, if released, would endanger the safety of the public or an individual, or would commit a Schedule 1 offence,s 60(4)(a). the court takes the following into account: * the degree of violence implicit in the charge; * a threat of violence the accused may have made to any person; * any resentment the accused is alleged to harbour towards any person; * the accused's disposition towards violence as evidenced by his past conduct; * the disposition of the accused to commit Schedule I offences, as evidenced by past conduct; * the prevalence of a particular type of offence; * any evidence that the accused has previously committed a Schedule 1 offence while out on bail; and * any other factor.s 60(5). Certain of these grounds are part of the common law on bail.S v Baker; S v Doyle 1965 (1) SA 821 (W).S v Fourie 1973 (1) SA 100 (D).S v Kyriacou 2000 (2) SACR 704 (O).  Evasion of trial  In considering the likelihood that the accused will attempt to evade trial if released, the court takes into account the following: * the emotional, family, community or occupational ties of the accused to the place of trial; * any assets held by the accused, and where; * any means, and travel documents held by the accused, which may enable flight from the country; * the extent, if any, to which the accused could afford to forfeit the bail money; * the ease of extradition in the event of flight across the border; * the nature and gravity of the charge; * the strength of the state's case; * the nature and gravity of punishment in the event of conviction; * the binding effect and enforceability of possible bail conditions, and the ease with which these conditions could be breached; and * any other factor.s 60(6). Certain of these grounds are also part of the common law.S v Vermaas 1996 (1) SACR 528 (T). In S v Hudson,1980 (4) SA 145 (D). it was held that the likely heavy sentence in the event of conviction is also a factor, as is the foreign nationality of accused, while S v Lulane1976 (2) SA 204 (N). the matter of the strength of the state's case was also invoked.  Influence or intimidation of witnesses  In considering the likelihood that the accused will attempt to influence or intimidate witnesses, or conceal or destroy evidence,s 60(4)(c). court takes into account the following: * whether the accused is familiar with the identity of the witnesses and the evidence they can give; * whether the witnesses have already made statements and have agreed to testify; * whether the police investigation of the case has been completed; * the relationship of the accused to the witnesses and the extent of possible influence or intimidation; * how effective would be possible bail conditions prohibiting communication with witnesses; * whether the accused has access to evidentiary material which is to be presented at trial; * the ease with which evidentiary material could be concealed or destroyed; and * any other factor.s 60(7). Certain of these grounds are part of the common law.S v Hlongwa 1979 (4) SA 112 (D).  Undermining criminal justice system  In considering the likelihood that the accused, if released, will undermine or jeopardise the objectives of the proper functioning of the criminal justice system, including the bail system,s 60(4)(d). the court takes into account the following:s 60 (8). * whether the accused deliberately supplied false information at the time of his arrest or during bail proceedings; * whether the accused is in custody on another charge, or is on parole; * any previous failure to comply with bail conditions, or any indication that the accused will not comply this time; and * any other factor.  Public order  In considering the likelihood that release will disturb the public order or undermine public peace or security,s 60(4)(e). the court takes into account the following: * whether the nature or circumstances of the offence are likely to induce a sense of shock or outrage in the community in which it was committed; * whether such shock or outrage might lead to public disorder if the accused were to be released; * whether the safety of the accused might be jeopardised by his release; * whether the sense of peace or security of the public would be undermined or jeopardised by his release; * whether his release would undermine or jeopardise public confidence in the criminal justice system; and * any other factor.s 60 (8A). On the issue of possible disturbance of public order, the cases of S v Mohammed1999 (2) SACR 507 (C). and S v Bennett2000 (1) SACR 406 (W). are relevant. = When the onus is on the accused = In certain circumstances, the onus will be on the accused during the bail application. For a Schedule 6 offence, the accused has to adduce evidence to satisfy the court that exceptional circumstances exist in which the interests of justice permit his release.s 60(11)(a). For a Schedule 5 offence, the accused has to adduce evidence to satisfy the court that the interests of justice permit his release.s 60(11)(b). The court hearing such a bail application, when the offence is a Schedule 5 or 6 offence, must conduct a careful enquiry before deciding to release the accused on bail.S v Mabena 2007 (1) SACR 482 (SCA). (There must be proper proof that the offence is indeed a scheduled offence.S v Kock 2003 (2) SACR 5 (SCA).) S v Rudolph(484/09) [2009] ZASCA 133 (30 September 2009). is a prominent example of the application of this onus.  Proof that offence is a Schedule 5 or 6 offence  The DPP may issue written confirmation that he intends to charge the accused with a scheduled offence.s 60(11A). This is prima facie proof of the charge to be brought.  Duty to disclose information regarding previous convictions  The accused or his legal adviser is compelled to inform court of * any previous convictions; and * whether he has any other charges pending, and whether he has been released on bail in respect thereof.s 60(11B). = Record = The record of bail proceedings forms part of the trial record.s 60(11B)(c). The court has a duty to warn the accused that anything said by him in evidence during bail proceedings may be used in evidence against him at trial. Bail proceedings are to be recorded in full.s 64. = Docket = The accused is not ordinarily entitled to the police docket, etcetera, for the purpose of a bail application.s 60(14). The prosecutor, however, may waive this provision. = Constitutionality = As to the constitutionality of the provisions in section 60, sections 60(4) to 60(9), 60(11)(a), 60(11B)(c) and 60(14) were held to be constitutional in S v Dlamini. = Conditions = Bail may be granted subject to conditions.s 60(12). The following general principles apply to conditions of bail: * They must not be contra bonos mores.S v Louw 2000 (2) SACR 714 (T). * They must not be vague or ambiguous.S v Budlender 1973 (1) SA 264 (C). * They must not be ultra vires.S v Russell 1978 (1) SA 223 (C). * They should be practicably feasible.Rex v Fourie 1947 (2) SA 574 (O). Further conditions may be added subsequently on application by the prosecutor.s 62. This provision also gives a useful list of the types of conditions that may be imposed at the outset. The court has the power to increase or reduce the amount of bail, or to amend or supplement any condition, on application by the prosecutor or the accused.s 63. = Heads of prisons = The power of the head of a prison to apply in certain circumstances for release on warning instead of bail, or amendment of bail conditions, is regulated by section 63A, which is a radical new measure aimed at permitting a head of prison to initiate release on bail when the conditions (due to overcrowding, for example) of awaiting-trial prisoners become intolerable. = Appeals = Appeals are permitted to the High Court against a refusal of bail by a lower court, or against the amount or conditions of bail.section 65. The appeal shall not lie on the basis of new facts, unless such facts are first brought before the lower court which dealt with the bail application.s 65(2). As to what is meant by \\"new facts,\\" see S v Petersen.2008 (2) SACR 355 (C). Appeals are also permitted by the DPP to the High Court against a decision to release on bail, or against a bail condition.s 65A. This is a new measure. The DPP requires leave to appeal.s 65A(1)(b), read with s 310A. This section (65) should be read with sections 65(1)(b) and (c), and sections 65(2), (3) and (4). = Failure of accused to observe conditions of bail = In terms of section 66, the prosecutor may apply to court to have bail cancelled on grounds of noncompliance with the conditions of bail. If the accused is present and disputes the allegation, the court will hear evidence.s 66(1). If he is absent, the court will issue a warrant for his arrest, and then decide the issue when the accused is present.s 66(2). If the court finds fault on part of the accused, bail may be cancelled and bail money forfeited to the state.s 66(3). = Failure of accused to appear = If the accused on bail fails to appear in court on the due date, the court will declare bail provisionally cancelled and bail money provisionally forfeited, and will issue a warrant of arrest.s 67 (1). If the accused appears within fourteen days, the court will enquire into his absence. It will then confirm the cancellation and forfeiture unless the accused shows no fault.s 67(2). This provision contains a reverse onus, and a similar reverse onus in the case of non-appearance, after release on warning was modified by the Constitutional Court in S v Singo2002 (2) SACR 160 (CC); 2002 (4) SA 858 (CC). to read that the onus is on the State. = Criminal liability for failure to appear or failure to observe a condition of bail = Section 67A now makes it a criminal offence not to appear when on bail, or not to observe a condition of bail. = Cancellation of bail in circumstances other than sections 66 and 67 = In terms of section 68, bail may also be cancelled by the court in the following circumstances: * when the accused is about to evade justice or abscond; * when the accused has interfered with witnesses, or threatened or attempted to interfere with them; * when the accused has defeated or attempted to defeat the ends of justice; * when the accused poses a threat to the safety of the public or an individual; * when the accused has not fully disclosed all previous convictions during the bail hearing; * when further evidence or factors come to light (including falsity of information during bail proceedings) which might have affected the decision to grant bail; and * if generally it is in the interests of justice. = Release on warning in lieu of bail = The court may release the accused on warning instead of bail.s 72. Conditions may be imposed, as with release on bail. Failure to attend or to comply with a condition is a criminal offence.s 72(2). The Constitutional Court has inserted words into this section to \\"read down\\" the reverse-onus provision.S v Singo.  Bail pending appeal  When an appeal against a conviction or sentence or order of a lower court is noted, this does not automatically suspend the operation of the sentence unless the court releases the convicted person on bail.s 309(4)(b), read with s 307. If the convicted person was out on bail for trial, the court granting bail pending appeal (or review) may extend bail, in the same amount or in any other amount.s 307(2)(a). If the convicted person was not previously on bail for the trial, the court may release him on bail on condition that he deposits the stated amount.s 307(2)(b). The court may permit the convicted person to furnish a guarantee instead of cash.s 307(2)(c). It shall be a condition of release that the convicted person shall surrender himself at the time and place specified by court, and upon service of notice in the prescribed manner, to commence the sentence, in the event that the convicted person still has to undergo imprisonment after the disposal of the appeal.s 307 (3). The court may add conditions deemed necessary or advisable in interests of justice, as to, for example, * reporting; * places where the convicted person may not go (for example, to any airport); and * other matters relating to the conduct of the convicted person.s 307 (4). Sections 63, 64, 65, 66 and 68 of the CPA apply with the necessary changes.s 307 (6). This means that * the court may amend bail conditions subsequently;s 63. * proceedings are to be recorded in full;s 64. * the appeal lies to the High Court against a refusal of bail, or against the amount or conditions of bail;s 65. * the steps to be taken in the event of failure to comply with bail conditions are the same as for the pre-trial accused;s 66. * the bail cancellation provisions are the same as for the pre- trial accused.s 68. The provisions of section 60 do not apply to bail pending appeal, although they may still be relevant to the extent that they embody common-law concepts. The fact that the person is now convicted and sentenced to imprisonment changes the position practically: There is no longer a presumption of innocence, on the one hand; on the other hand, the incentive to evade justice is greater. In principle, bail may be granted even if the case is serious and the convicted person is facing a long period of imprisonment. The key factor is whether or not the convicted person will report for sentence.R v Milne and Erleigh (4) 1950 (4) SA 601 (W). It is improper to fix an unaffordable amount of bail if there are good prospects of success on appeal.S v Phetani 2007 (2) SACR 590 (SCA). Even if there is no indication that the convicted person will try to evade justice, bail may be refused on the ground that the prospects of success on appeal are small.S v Beer 1986 (2) SA 307 (SEC).S v Rawat 1999 (2) SACR 398 (W). Some cases, however, have found that bail should not lightly be refused on this ground alone, especially by the lower courts, which do not have experience in assessing the prospects of a successful appeal.S v De Villiers 1999 (1) SACR 297 (O).S v Ndlovu and Another 1999 (2) SACR 645 (W). Logically, a court may refuse bail pending appeal if it is an appeal against the sentence only. At best for the convicted person, whichever way the appeal goes, he will still end up serving a lengthy period of imprisonment. If a convicted person loses his appeal to the High Court, he may still be released on bail pending an application for leave to appeal or petition to the SCA.R v Patel 1952 (1) SA 674 (T). Some cases have held that the onuses imposed under section 60(11) of the CPA also apply to bail pending appeal.S v Scott-Crossley 2007 (2) SACR 590 (SCA). The correctness of these cases is doubtful.S v Crossberg [2007] SCA 93 (RSA).  Ascertainment of bodily features  Without the need for a court order, police in certain circumstances may do various things to ascertain the bodily condition, etc., of the accused.s 37(1)-(2). The two most important such circumstances are # where the accused is a person arrested on any charge;s 37(1)(a)(i). and # where he is a person released on bail or on a warning under section 72.s 37(1)(a)(i). The police so authorised may do certain things themselves, like * take fingerprints, palm-prints or foot-prints;s 37(1)(a). * make the arrested person available for an identity parade;s 37(1)(b). * take photographs;s 37(1)(d). and * take such steps as are deemed necessary to ascertain whether the person's body has any \\"mark, characteristic or distinguishing feature,\\" or \\"shows any condition or appearance.\\" The police may not take a blood sample themselves, however, or examine a female unless the examiner is also female.s 37(1)(c). In cases in which the police are authorised in terms of these provisions to take the relevant steps, certain medical officers may also take such steps (including the drawing of blood samples) as may be necessary to ascertain whether the body has a \\"mark, characteristic or distinguishing feature,\\" as contemplated in section 37(2). The medical officer of a prison and a district surgeon do not need a police request to proceed in this way, but other medical practitioners and nurses do. In terms of section 37(2)(b), a medical practitioner attached to a hospital may take a blood sample of a person admitted to the hospital if he is of the reasonable opinion that such a sample may be relevant at later criminal proceedings. In cases where the police, etc., are not authorised to act under subsections (1) or (2), the court before which criminal proceedings are pending may order the same steps.s 37(3). If no prosecution is instituted, or if the prosecution has been instituted and the accused acquitted, the fingerprints, etc., are to be destroyed.s 37(5). = Constitutionality = There have been two types of constitutional challenge to section 37 thus far: * The taking of samples, etc., violates the accused's right not to incriminate himself, as guaranteed by the Constitution.s 35(3)(j). * The process of obtaining a sample, etc., violates the accused's constitutional right ** to dignity;s 10. ** not to be treated in a cruel or inhuman or degrading way;s 12(1)(e). and ** to bodily and psychological integrity.s 12(2). As to the first type of challenge, the courts have consistently held that the taking of such samples does not violate one's right not to incriminate oneself. Section 35(3)(j) of the Constitution only covers the right not to incriminate oneself by way of communications.Levack and Others v Regional Magistrate, Wynberg and Another 2003 (1) SACR 187 (SCA).S v Huma and Another 1995 (2) SACR 411 (W).S v Maphumulo 1996 (2) SACR 84 (N).Ex parte Minister of Justice. In re R v Matemba 1941 AD 75.Minister of Safety and Security and Another v Gaqa 2002 (1) SACR 654 (C). As to the second type, the courts have held that the provision permitting the obtaining of samples is a reasonable limitation of constitutional rights under section 36 of the Constitution.S v Huma.Minister of Safety and Security v Gaqa.S v Orrie 2004 (1) SACR 162 (C). = In practice = The types of situations described above frequently take the following forms in practice: * fingerprints and footprints; * blood samples (which are often used now for DNA matching, but which can also be used to determine alcohol levels); * hair samples; * X-rays (to ascertain, for example, the age of the accused for sentencing purposes); * identity parades; * handwriting specimens; * photographs; and * voice samples, in respect of which an important case is Levack v Regional Magistrate, where the SCA held that these are included under \\"distinguishing features.\\"Paras 8‚Äì14. Also noteworthy is the unusual case of Minister of Safety and Security v Gaqa, where the High Court granted the police an order permitting the surgical removal of a bullet from a suspect's leg to compare it with a firearm used on the scene of the crime. See also Minister of Safety and Security v Xaba.2004 (1) SACR 149 (D).  Identity parades  To ensure fairness and reliability, there are certain recognised procedures for identity parades.R v Masemang. The police also have standing rules to govern identity-parade procedures.See the commentary on section 37 in Du Toit. Nowadays identity parades are often videotaped to minimise disputes about what occurred in or was established by them. Some specially fitted identity-parade rooms have one-way glass so that witnesses do not feel intimidated by confrontation with possible suspects. Sometimes identity parades are not possible or feasible, in which case photo parades take place. For the suitable conditions for photo parades, see S v Ndika.2002 (1) SACR 250 (SCA).  Charges  The prosecutor, as dominus litis, decides whom to charge, what charges to bring, how to frame them, etc. Any number of charges may be joined in the same proceedings against the same accused, before any evidence has been led.s 81(1). The charges are to be numbered consecutively (usually as \\"Count 1,\\" \\"Count 2\\" and so on). The court may, if it believes this to be in the interests of justice, direct that one or more charges be tried separately.s 81(2). Such an order may be made even after the plea. Where there is uncertainty as to which charges the facts will prove, the accused may be charged with all or any of the possibilities at once.s 83. Charges may also be framed in the alternative. It is important in this regard to note that an objection may be taken not to the so-called \\"splitting of charges,\\" but rather to the duplication of convictions.S v Grobler 1966 (1) SA 507 (A). The charge must contain the following: * the time of the offence; * the place of the offence; * the person against whom the offence was committed (if appropriate); and * the property in respect of which the offence was committed (if appropriate). All this is to inform the accused, with reasonable particularity, of the nature of the charge or charges against him.s 84(1). On the importance of properly informing the accused of the nature of the charge or charges, see S v Wannenburg.2007 (1) SACR 27 (C). On the applicable presumptions, see Moloi v Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs.2010 (2) SACR 78 (CC). Where any of the above particulars are unknown to prosecutor, it is sufficient that this be stated in the charge.s 84(2). If the offence is a statutory one, it is sufficient to describe it in the words of the law which created the offence.s 84(3). An objection to the charge must be taken before the plea. It must be on the grounds that * the charge does not comply with the relevant provisions of the CPA; * the charge does not set out an essential element of the offence; * the charge does not disclose an offence (as, for example, when the statute cited has been repealed); * the charge does not contain sufficient particulars of any matter alleged in the charge; or * the accused is not correctly named or described in the charge.s 85(1). The accused must give reasonable notice to the prosecution of his intention to object to the charge, unless the prosecution waives notice. If the court agrees with the defence's objection, it may order the prosecution to amend the charge or deliver particulars. If the prosecution does not comply, the court may quash the charge.s 85(2)(a).  Amendment of charges  The Constitution provides that the accused is entitled to reasonable clarity about the charge.s 35(3)(a). A court may amend the charge at any time before judgment, if there is no prejudice in doing so to the accused, on one or more of the following grounds: * want of an essential averment;S v Hugo 1976 (4) SA 536 (A). * variance between the charge and the evidence;S v Grey 1983 (2) SA 536 (C). * missing words or particulars;R v Crause 1959 (1) SA 272 (A).R v Herschel 1920 AD 575. * excess words or particulars; and * any other error.s 86. Amendment is possible even if the original charge discloses no offence.s 86(1). This portion of the legislation was introduced to correct the effect of R v Herschel.1920 AD 575. The judge, when granting an amendment, may grant adjournment to the accused if he thinks fit.s 86(2). The basic test is whether or not the accused will be prejudiced.S v Coetzer 1976 (2) SA 769 (A).S v Sithole 1997 (2) SACR 306 (ZSC). The courts have held that most types of possible prejudice can be cured by suitable adjournment and the opportunity to call or recall witnesses.R v Herschel. The fact that the charge is not amended shall not affect the validity of proceedings, unless the court refuses to grant an amendment.s 86(4). Although amendment is permissible, substitution is not.S v Grey.S v Barketts Transport.S v Tungata. Substitution is never possible, in fact‚Äîeven if there would be no prejudice to the accused. Charges may be amended on appeal or review.s 86(4), read with s 304, 309. The test, again, is prejudice.S v SA Metal & Machinery Co. Where a charge is defective for the want of an averment which is an essential ingredient of the relevant offence, the defect shall, unless brought to the notice of the court before judgment, be cured by evidence at the trial proving the matter which should have been averred.s 88. S v Van Wyk1974 (1) SA36 (A). is relevant here.  Plea of guilty  Generally speaking, where an accused pleads guilty at his trial there is no issue between him and the State and he may be sentenced, there and then, on his plea. Section 112(1) applies when the accused pleads guilty to the offence charged, or to an offence of which he may be convicted on the charge (for example, a plea of guilty to common assault on a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm), when the prosecutor accepts that plea. The legal effect of the prosecutor's action in accepting the plea to a lesser offence is illustrated in S v Ngubane.1985 (3) SA 677 (A). In terms of section 112(1)(a), the accused pleads guilty to the offence and conviction follows on the plea only. The presiding officer in such circumstances must be of the view that the offence pleaded does not warrant imprisonment without the option of a fine, or a fine exceeding the amount determined by Minister from time to time (currently R1,500). The presiding officer imposes any competent sentence other than imprisonment without option of fine, or a fine exceeding amount determined by Minister. \\"Imprisonment\\" here means any form of imprisonment, including periodical imprisonment.S v Gunda 2007 (1) SACR 75 (N).S v Williams 2009 (1) SACR 192 (C). This section should not be invoked in serious matters.S v Sinque 2000 (1) SACR 630 (E).S v WilIiams (2009). In terms of section 112(1)(b), the accused pleads guilty and # the presiding officer is of the opinion that the offence merits punishment exceeding the limits provided in section 112(1)(a); or # the prosecutor requests that the presiding officer go the route of section 112(1)(b). The presiding officer questions the accused with reference to the alleged facts to establish whether or not the accused admits the allegations in the charge. The presiding officer may convict if satisfied that the accused is guilty. For the purpose of section 112(1)(b), see S v Mkhize,1978 (1) SA 264 (N). the Appellate Division's judgment in S v Naidoo1989 (2) SA 114 (A). and S v Diniso.1999 (1) SACR 532 (C). On the question of whether or not the accused should be warned of his right to silence, etc., see S v Damons1997 (2) SACR 218 (W). and S v Nkosi,1984 (3) SA 345 (A). but note Director of Public Prosecutions, Natal v Magidela2000 (1) SACR 458 (SCA).465‚Äì466. = Basic rules governing questioning = The basic rules governing questioning are as follows: * There is to be no cross-examination of the accused. * Leading questions should be avoided. * Questioning should not be confined simply to asking the accused if he admits each allegation.S v Mkhize 1978 (1) SA 264 (N). * The court should not try to persuade the accused that denial of a fact is incorrect or invalid. * Unnecessary legal terminology should be avoided. * Care should be taken when the accused asked to admit facts outside his personal knowledge.S v Naidoo 1985 (2) SA 32 (N). * The accused's answers are not evidence that can be evaluated.S v Naidoo (A). * Questioning does not have to eliminate all possible defences.S v Phundula 1978 (4) SA 855 (T). For an example of grossly irregular questioning, see S v Williams2008 (1) SACR 65 (C). Section 112(2) provides that, in lieu of questioning under section 112(1)(b), the accused or his legal representative may hand in a written statement setting out the facts admitted and on which he has pleaded guilty. The presiding officer may convict, if satisfied that the accused is guilty, and also question the accused to clarify anything in the statement. For an example of an inadequate statement, see S v Carter.2007 (2) SACR 415 (SCA). See also S v Chetty.2008 (2) SACR 157 (W). Generally on section 112(2), see S v Nixon.2000 (2) SACR 79 (W). In terms of section 112(3), evidence, etc., may still be led on sentence. If, at any stage before sentencing, there is doubt that the accused is guilty, or if it appears that the accused does not admit, or has not admitted, any allegation in the charge, or that the accused may have a valid defence, or for any other reason, the court may enter a plea of not guilty. The trial then continues on that basis. Any admitted allegation which is not in question will stand.s 113. For more, see Attorney-General, Transvaal v Botha,1993 (2) SACR 587 (A). S v Nixon and S v H2004 (1) SACR 144 (T). There is no onus on the accused when he seeks to alter a plea of guilty to one of not guilty at the trial stage. This is different if change of plea is first sought on appeal, in which case the onus is on the accused to satisfy the court.Qoko v La Grange 2004 (2) SACR 521 (E).  Plea of not guilty  When the accused enters a plea of not guilty at summary trial, the presiding officer may ask the accused if he wishes to make a statement indicating the basis of his defence.s 115(1). If the accused does not make such a statement, or if it is unclear from his statement what is in dispute between him and the state, the court may question the accused to establish what is in dispute.s 115(2)(a). The court may in its discretion put any question to the accused to obtain clarity. The court shall ask accused whether any allegation not in issue may be recorded as an admission in terms of section 220 (which provides that formal admissions by the accused relieve the State of the burden of proving such facts).s 115(2)(b). If the accused consents, this is recorded as a formal admission.s 115(2)(b). If the accused's legal adviser replies to any question by the court, the court will require the accused to provide confirmation.s 115(3). It is a rule of practice that the court informs the accused of his right not to make a statement or answer questions.S v Daniels 1983 (3) SA 275 (A). The question has arisen, in terms of section 35(3)(h) of the Constitution, of whether or not section 115 is constitutional. It is improper for the court to cross-examine the accused during questioning.S v Seleke 1980 (3) SA 745 (A). It is a rule of practice that the court informs the accused of the effect of formal admissions.S v Daniels. At the end of the state's case, the court should inform an undefended accused that a plea explanation is no substitute for evidence under oath.S v Mkhize 1978 (2) SA 249 (N). All warnings, explanations, etc., should be properly recorded.S v Daniels. The effect of a formal admissions 220. is to relieve the state of the necessity of proving the fact or facts in question.S v Sesetse 1981 (3) SA 353 (A). Such formal admissions are only of facts unfavourable to the accused.S v Kuzwayo 1964 (3) SA 55 (N). If the accused does not consent to the recording of uncontested allegations, this will be material for cross-examination by the state. Such admissions may also have some weight in favour of the state at the end of the case.S v Mjoli 1981 (3)SA 1233 (A). The court may have regard to both the incriminatory and the exculpatory parts of the plea explanation, as the court held in S v Cloete.1994 (1) SACR 420 (A). In R v Valachia,1945 AD 826. it was held that the court will usually be inclined to pay attention more to the incriminatory parts than to the exculpatory ones.  After plea  The general rule is that an accused who has pleaded is entitled to a verdict.s 106(4).S v Sithole 1999 (1) SACR 227 (T). This does not mean that the accused is entitled to a verdict immediately; it means only that proceedings may not be concluded without reaching a verdict. This contrasts with the situation where the accused has not pleaded: Here the case could, for example, be withdrawn, and the accused would not be entitled to a verdict. An exception is mentioned in section 106(4), where there is a plea that the court has no jurisdiction to try the offence. The following are also exceptions: * where the presiding officer recuses himself;S v Lapping 1998 (1) SACR 409 (W). * where it is impossible for the judicial officer to continue with the trial;S v Zungu 1984 (1) SA 376 (N).S v Stoffels 2004 (1) SACR 176 (C). * where the accused is declared a state patient;s 77(6) (a). * where there is a conversion of the trial into an enquiry;s 254, 255. * where there are plea proceedings under Chapter 19 and 19A of the CPA (preliminary pleas in one court with a view to trial in another);S v Hendrix 1979 (3) SA 816 (D).Van Vuuren v Esterhuizen NO [1996] 4 All SA 430 (A). and * when separation of trials is ordered.s 157. = Separation of trials = An accused may be joined with any other accused in the same criminal proceedings at any time before any evidence has been led in respect of the charge in question.s 157(1). In terms of section 157(2), the state or the accused may apply for separation. The court has a discretion whether to grant this application.R v Bagas 1952 (1) SA 437 (A). As a general rule, it is preferable that alleged joint offenders be tried together.S v Levy 1967 (1) SA 347 (W).R v Kritzinger 1952 (4) SA 651 (W). The test of whether or not to grant separation centres once more on the question of prejudice‚Äîbut it is a question of whether prejudice is likely, not merely whether it is possible.S v Shuma 1994 (2) SACR 486 (E). For an example of the application of the principle, see S v Groesbeek. When some accused pleads guilty to one or more charges, and others plead not guilty, the practice is to grant separation.R v Zonele 1959 (3) SA 319 (A). Failure to separate in such circumstances is not necessarily or automatically prejudicial, however.S v Bapela 1985 (1) SA 236 (A). The court may abstain from giving judgment against any accused whose trial is separated.s 157(2).  Contested trial  Proceedings usually take place in open court,s 152. unless one of the exceptional situations provided for in section 153 is present. The prosecutor may make an opening address.s 150(1). In practice this occurs only in complicated or serious cases. The purpose of the opening address is to allow the state to explain what the case is about and how it intends to prove it. This will also help the court and the defence to follow the evidence. The prosecutor then leads the evidence of the state witnesses in the order of his choice.s 150(2)(a). (This is because the prosecutor is dominus litis.) If certain documents are admissible as evidence on mere production‚Äîthat is, without having a witness hand them in and explain them‚Äîthe prosecutor will read them out.s 150(2)(b). Documents of this type are catered for specifically in certain provisions.See, for example, s 212. The prosecutor is not obliged to lead all available evidence,R v Hellbron 1922 TPD 99. but he must make available to the defence those witnesses whom he does not call.R v Riekert 1954 (4) SA 254 (SWA). The prosecutor is under a duty to make favourable information available to the defence.S v Van Rensburg 1963 (2) SA 343 (N). The defence may cross-examine each state witness after evidence in chief.s 166(1). Where there are multiple accused, each may cross-examine. The purpose of cross-examination is * to test the accuracy of the evidence; and * to elicit material favourable to the defence. The duty of the cross-examiner is to put his case to a witness.S v Boesak 2000 (1) SACR 632 (SCA).Paras 51‚Äì53. For the application of this principle to the prosecutor as well, see S v Manicum1998 (2) SACR 400 (N). Although, in S v Fortuin,2008 (1) SACR 511 (C). the court is generally conceded to have arrived at the correct conclusion, it confused the effect of not cross-examining. Failure to allow a cross-examination may amount to a fatal irregularity.S v Manqaba 2005 (2) SACR 489 (W). After cross- examination, the prosecutor may re-examine the witness.s 166(1). At end of the state case, before the defence case, the court may discharge the accused.s 174. The test is whether or not there is now any evidence before court on which a reasonable court could (not should) convict the accused.R v Shein 1925 AD 6. In S v Legote,2001 (2) SACR 179 (SCA). it was held that the court has a duty to discharge an unrepresented accused ex mero motu if the evidence against him is too flimsy.Paras 9‚Äì10. Credibility is not usually an issue at this stage. The state's evidence is taken at face value.S v National Board of Executors Ltd 1971 (3) SA 817 (D). Credibility may occasionally be considered if the court is of the opinion that the state evidence is such that no reasonable court could convict on it.S v Mpetha 1983 (4) SA 262 (C). On the question of whether or not a court may exercise its discretion not to discharge if, although there is no state evidence to incriminate the accused, the possibility exists that incriminating evidence may emerge during the defence case, see S v Shuping1983 (2) SA 119 (B). and S v Lubaxa.2001 (2) SACR 703 (SCA). There are two contingencies in this regard: # the possibility of incriminating evidence from the accused himself; and # the possibility of incriminating evidence from the co-accused. Lubaxa holds that, today, only the second contingency is a sound basis for refusing discharge. If the court decides to refuse on the first ground, however, it must have reason to believe that the co-accused might in fact incriminate the accused applying for discharge.S v Nkosi (41 1/10) [2011] ZASCA 83 (27 May 2011). If there is no discharge at end of the state case, the defence presents its case. It may deliver an opening address,s 151(1)(a). if it desires, and then call the accused and any witnesses it chooses. The state cross-examines these witnesses, and the defence may re-examine them. The accused is usually obliged to testify before defence witnesses.s 151(1)(b)(i). Explanations must be given to an undefended accused. He must be informed carefully of all the rights which affect the conduct of his case: for example, * the effect of the earlier plea explanation, in particular the fact that it is not equivalent to evidence; * any reverse onus placed on him; and * competent verdicts on the charge. The defence may elect to close its case without calling the accused or any witnesses. If it does so, the court may come to the conclusion that the prima facie state evidence may be accepted as proof beyond reasonable doubt.Constitution s 35(3)(h).S v Boesak 2001 (1) SACR 1 (CC), paras 17‚Äì28.S v Boesak (SCA), paras 42‚Äì53.S v Francis 1991 (1) SACR 198 (A).S v Tandwa 2008 (1) SACR 613 (SCA).S v Hendricks (415/09) [2010] ZASCA 55 (31 March 2009). The effect of false testimony by the accused is usually equivalent to his giving no evidence.S v Mtsweni 1985 (1) SA 590 (A).S v Potswana 1994 (1) SACR 159 (A). The court may itself call witnessess 167.s 186. where this is necessary for a just decision of the case. The judge is not merely a passive umpire; he is an administrator of justice.R v Hepworth 1928 AD 265.R v Gani 1958 (1) SA 102 (A).S v Shezi 1994 (1) SACR 575 (A).S v Gabaatlholwe [2003] 1 All SA 1 (SCA).S v Mseleku 2006 (2) SACR 237 (N).Director of Public Prosecutions, Transvaal v Mtshweni 2007 (2) SACR 217 (SCA). The court's power to deal with recalcitrant witnesses is regulated in section 189 of the CPA. The impeachment of witnesses is dealt with in section 190. For the meaning of \\"hostile witness,\\" and the effect of a declaration of witness as hostile, see, for example, Meyers Trustee v Malan1911 TPD 559. and City Panel Beaters v Bana.1985 (2) SA 155 (D). Impeachment of the credit of one's own witness is dealt with in section 190(2), and in R v Loofer1952 (3) SA 798 (C). and S v Muhiaba.1973 (3) SA 141 (R). Proof of a previous inconsistent statement does not make that statement evidence against the accused. Other points of the witness's evidence not covered by the deviation may still be accepted by the court.S v Millar 1972 (1) SA 427 (RA). The fact that a witness has lied on one point does not prevent the court from accepting his evidence on another point.R v Gumede 1949 (3) SA 749 (A).  Sentence  The main purposes of sentencing are retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. In some ways, sentencing is the most important part of the trial. Until fairly recently, insufficient attention was given to this stage of proceedings. A court may, before passing sentence, receive such evidence as it thinks fit to inform itself as to the proper sentence to be passed. The accused may address the court on any evidence thus received, as well as on the actual matter of the sentence; after him, the prosecution may likewise address the court. Disputed issues on sentence should be advanced under oath, but uncontested facts may be advanced from the bar without evidence.R v Hartley 1966 (4) SA 219 (RA).S v Caleni 1990 (1) SACR 178 (C).S v Olivier 2010 (2) SACR 178 (SCA). It is undesirable that contentious facts be placed before the court by a third-party witness who does not have personal knowledge of such facts.S v Kleynhans 2005 (2) SACR 582 (W). It is important that the accused or his legal representative advance facts and submissions in mitigation of sentence: for example, * youth; * a clean record; * old age; * economic circumstances, etc. Conversely, the state should bring before the court any factors which may aggravate sentence: for example, * evidence about the trauma of the victim; * the prevalence of the crime in question; and * its effect, either in general or in this specific case, on the community or environment, etc. In considering sentence, the court should have regard to the famous Zinn1969 (2) SA 537 (A). triad: # the crime; # the criminal; and # interests of society. Where the accused is the primary caregiver of young children, additional considerations apply,S v M 2007 (2) SACR 539 (CC). but see S v Isaacs,2002 (1) SACR 176 (C). where it was suggested that court should have more regard to the interests of the victim. = Types of sentence = The types of sentence, under section 276 of CPA, are as follows: * imprisonment; * periodical imprisonment; * declaration as a habitual criminal; * committal to an institution;s 296. * a fine; * correctional supervision;See s 276A(1). and * imprisonment from which the Commissioner of Correctional Services may place the prisoner under correctional supervision.See s 276A(2)-(4). Dangerous criminals may be sentenced to imprisonment for an indefinite period.s 286A.s 286B. A fine should generally be affordable to the accused, even though he may have to sell some of his assets to pay it. Fines are usually imposed with the alternative of imprisonment.s 287. Juveniles (those under eighteen years of age) may be given special sentences.See s 290. = Cumulative or concurrent sentences = Sentences run consecutively unless the court orders otherwise. Courts should always have regard to the cumulative effect of sentences.S v Koutandos 2002 (2) SACR 222 (SCA). For a spectacular example of the difference made by causing sentences to run concurrently, see S v Assante.2003 (2) SACR 117 (SCA). = Postponement and suspension of sentences = Postponement of the passing of a sentence, or suspension of a sentence, usually on conditions (such as good conduct, compensation, correctional supervision, instruction or treatment, or any other condition the court thinks appropriate), is permitted in terms of section 297(1). The maximum period of postponement or suspension is five years.s 297(1)(a)-(b). Sentences are usually only postponed in the less serious cases, or where special circumstances prevail: for example, where the age of the offender is an important factor.s 297 (2)-(3). Suspended sentences are imposed frequently, either in whole or in part.s 297(4)-(9). It is important that the conditions * be carefully worded; * have some bearing on the offence convicted; * be within the control of the accused; * be reasonable;S v Benn; S v Jordaan; S v Gabriels 2004 (2) SACR 156 (C). and * comply with constitutional values.S v Saayman 2008 (1) SACR 393 (E). Where only part of a sentence of imprisonment is suspended, the period of suspension starts running from the date of release from prison, not from the date of imposition.Ex parte Minister of Justice: In re Duze 1945 AD 102. For the difficulties that this interpretation may cause, see S v Mbombo.1984 (1) SA 390 (D). = Minimum sentences = Minimum-sentence provisions, in terms of section 51 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,Act 105 of 1997. are very important for the sentencing process at present. The provisions were originally introduced as an emergency measure, renewable by the President every two years. They have now been made a permanent feature of the sentencing process. They provide for very severe punishments of various types of serious crime. The provisions provide for certain minimum sentences in respect of various categories of serious offences set out in the schedules to the Act. In certain instances these minimum sentences are life sentences: for example, * for planned or premeditated murder; * for murder committed during rape or robbery with aggravating circumstances; * for rape by multiple persons; and * for rape committed by a person who knows that he is HIV-positive. In certain other cases, the minimums are lengthy periods of imprisonment. If the sentencing court finds that \\"substantial and compelling circumstances\\" are present, it may impose a lesser sentence. As to what constitutes a \\"substantial and compelling circumstance,\\" and how courts should approach the issue, see S v Malgas.2001 (1) SACR 469 (SCA). The Constitutional Court has ruled that the provisions of section 51(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act are not unconstitutional.S v Dodo 2001 (1) SACR 594 (CC). Section 51(1) provides for High Courts and regional courts to impose a minimum life sentence for certain crimes. It seems to follow that section 51(2), which provides for certain lengthy periods of imprisonment by High Courts and regional courts for slightly less serious crimes than in subsection (1), will also survive constitutional challenge. = Compensation orders = In terms of section 300 of the CPA, where the court convicts an accused of an offence involving damage to or loss of property belonging to another, the court * may, * upon application of the injured party, or the prosecutor acting on such party's instructions, award compensation to the injured party. The court may hear further evidence to establish civil liability or the amount of compensation. The maximum amounts which regional courts and magistrate's courts may award are laid down from time to time by the Minister of Justice. These awards have the effect of civil judgments. The person in whose favour an award is made may within sixty days renounce it. If he does not, that person will be precluded from proceeding civilly in connection with the same injury. An award under section 300 is usually inappropriate if the accused is sentenced to a lengthy period of imprisonment and has no assets.S v Baloyi 1981 (2) SA 227 (T).  Criminal appeals from lower courts  The accused has a right to appeal to the High Court against any conviction or sentence or order of a lower court.CPA, s 309.Constitution, s 35(3)(o). In 1997, provisions were introduced to require an accused who intended to appeal from a lower court to obtain leave to do so from that court, or (if such leave should be refused) from the High Court by way of petition.See s 309B, 309C. This process of leave to appeal involved an assessment of whether or not the prospects were reasonable that the High Court would come to a conclusion different from that of the trial court. The Constitutional Court, in S v Steyn,2001 (1) SACR 25 (CC). has declared these new provisions to be unconstitutional. The court's six-month moratorium has expired; accordingly sections 309B and 309C, in their original form, have fallen away. At the beginning of 2004, however, new legislation, the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act,Act 42 of 2003. was introduced. It requires leave to appeal in certain circumstances from lower-court convictions, sentences and orders. The most significant features of this legislation are the following: * Leave to appeal is again required, except where ** the accused is sentenced to imprisonment (unless wholly suspended); and is either *** younger than fourteen; or *** older than fourteen and younger than sixteen, and was not legally represented. * Appeals are decided in chambers on the basis of written argument, unless the judges decide that oral argument is desirable in the interests of justice. This part, however, was struck down as unconstitutional in Shinga v The State.2007 (2) SACR 28 (CC). * If leave to appeal is refused by the lower court's presiding officer, the accused may petition the Judge President of the relevant High Court. In Shinga, the Constitutional Court held that the requirement of leave to appeal from the lower courts, as set out in the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act, was constitutional. Appeals and applications for leave to appeal must be noted and followed up within the times and other requirements of the legislation and the rules of court.s 309(2).Rule 67 of the Magistrates' Courts Rules.Rule 51 of the High Court Rules. The noting of an appeal does not automatically suspend the execution of a sentence, unless the court decides to release the accused on bail.s 309(4)(b) read with s 307. Applications for leave to appeal must be written, setting out the basis for the appeal. If the application is made immediately after sentence, however, it is made orally, in court, and is taken down as part of the court record.s 309B(3)(b). In the case of appeals where no leave is required, there must be a written notice of appeal, which shall set out clearly and specifically the grounds of fact or law on which the appeal is based.Rule 67(1)(a), Magistrates' Courts Rules.S v Kruger 1970 (2) SA233 (N). After receipt of the notice, the magistrate or regional magistrate may give further reasons for his findings.Rule 67(3). The clerk of court prepares the record and forwards it to the High Court.Rule 67(13). Ultimate responsibility for ensuring that all copies of the record are properly before the High Court lies with the accused (now the appellant) or his attorney.High Court Rule 51(3). Rule 67 allows fifteen days for noting an appeal. This may be extended on good cause shown,s 309(2). or condonation. The general principle of condonation is that there must be a reasonable explanation for the delay, and reasonable prospects of success on appeal.S v Leon 1996 (1) SACR 671 (A). Prior to the hearing of the appeal, both parties must submit heads of argument.High Court Rule 51(4). Appeals are heard by at least two judges, but more may be assigned if the Judge President so chooses. = Powers of court on appeal = The powers of the court on appeal are the same as on automatic review:See s 309(3), 304(2). * to confirm, alter or quash the conviction, and (where appropriate) to substitute the conviction on an alternative charge; * to confirm, reduce, alter or set aside the sentence or other order; * to set aside or correct the proceedings; * to give such judgment, or impose such sentence, or give such order, as the magistrate ought to have given, etc.;This includes the power to upgrade the conviction to a more serious offence (S v E 1979 (3) SA 973 (A).). * to remit the case to the magistrate with instructions to deal with any matter as the High Court may think fit; * to make any order suspending the execution of the sentence, or releasing the accused on bail, that seems appropriate. In addition to powers of automatic review, the court of appeal may also increase the sentence.See proviso to s 309(2). For an example of the approach of the appeal courts to an increase of sentence, see S v Salzwedel.1999 (2) SACR 586 (SCA). Where the state or a court of appeal considers an increase in sentence, the practice is for notice to be given to the appellant.S v Sonday 1994 (2) SACR 810 (C). In general, for the approach of appeal court to * conviction, see R v Dhlumayo;1948 (2) SA 677 (A). If the trial court did not materially misdirect itself, the appeal court will not interfere with factual findings unless convinced that they were clearly wrong. If the trial court did materially misdirect itself, the appeal court is \\"at large\\" and will decide the case itself on the basis of the written record. and * sentence, see S v Anderson,1964 (3) SA 494 (A). S v Giannoulis,1975 (4) SA 867 (A). Malgas and S v Jiminez.2003 (1) SACR 507 (SCA). If there was no material misdirection by the trial court, the court of appeal will only interfere with the sentence if there is a striking disparity between what the trial court imposed and what the appeal court would have imposed. If there was a material misdirection, the appeal court is \\"at large\\" and imposes the sentence it deems fit. The same test applies, whether the original sentence is claimed to have been too severe or too lenient. Where a conviction or a sentence is set aside on appeal or review, because section 112 or 113 have not been applied or have not been properly applied, the appeal court must remit to the lower court for proper compliance with section 112 or 113.See s 312. Where conviction and sentence are set aside on appeal on grounds of technical irregularity, the accused may be retried.s 313 read with s 324. If an appeal is dismissed, and if he obtains the necessary leave, the accused may appeal further to the SCA.s 20 of the Supreme Court Act. The Provincial or Local Division gives leave to appeal: If leave is refused, the appellant may approach the SCA for such leave. The state may only appeal * on a question of law;s 310 (adverse finding of law in lower court).s 311 (adverse finding of law by High Court on appeal under s 309. or * on sentence.s 310A. Special procedural rules apply to either type of state appeal.  Review from proceedings in magistrate's court  = Automatic review = The system of automatic review of certain cases in the magistrate's court is unique to South Africa and goes back a long way. It is intended to protect an undefended accused against unjustified convictions and sentences imposed by magistrates.Lansdown and Campbell, p. 638. In terms of section 302, the following cases go on automatic review: * imprisonment exceeding three months, where the magistrate has less than seven years' service as such; * imprisonment exceeding six months, where the magistrate has at least seven years' service as such;s 302(1)(a)(i). and * fines exceeding the amount determined by Minister from time to time (currently exceeding R6 000 for a magistrate with less than seven years' experience, and R12 000 for a magistrate with more than seven years' experience). It is the individual sentence on each count that is taken into consideration when determining whether the sentence exceeds these limits, not the total effect of all the different sentences on each count.s 302(2)(a). Ten counts of theft with a R100 fine on each count would therefore not be automatically reviewable, even though the total sentence would exceed R6000. Even when the sentence exceeds the limit, there is no automatic review if the accused had a legal adviser.s 302(3). The automatic-review process is also suspended if the accused has noted an appeal, but it revives if the appeal is abandoneds 302(1)(b). and falls away if and when the appeal is disposed of. The clerk of court prepares a record and forwards it to High Court within one week after the determination of the case.s 303. On receipt of the record, the case is considered by single judge of the High Court. If he is satisfied that proceedings are in accordance with justice, he endorses the record accordingly, whereupon the record is returned to the magistrate's court.s 304(1). If the judge is not satisfied that proceedings are in accordance with justice, or if he is in doubt, he will refer case back to the magistrate for reasons.s 304 (2). In practice, he often queries a particular point or points. On receipt of the magistrate's reasons, the judge refers the case to a court of the Provincial or Local Division of the High Court to treat as an appeal. In practice two judges then consider the case in chambers, and then confirm or alter or set aside proceedings, giving a written judgment. If it is clear that the conviction or sentence is not in accordance with justice, and the accused would be prejudiced by a delay in getting the magistrate's reasons, the judge may skip the step of requesting such reasons.Proviso to s 304(2)(a). The court of appeal, in considering a review after receipt of the magistrate's reasons (or where this step is skipped), may have the case set down for argument by the Director of Public Prosecutions and counsel.s 304(3). The court may also hear any evidence, etc.,s 304(1)(b). although this rarely happens. = Powers of court on review = The powers of the court on review are as follows:s 304(2)(c). * to confirm, alter or quash the conviction, and where appropriate to substitute the conviction on another alternative charge; * to confirm, reduce, alter or set aside the sentence or other order; * to set aside or correct the proceedings; * to give such judgment or impose such sentence, or give such order, as the magistrate's court ought to have given or imposed; * to remit the case to the magistrate with instructions to deal with any matter as the High Court may think fit; and * to make any order suspending the execution of sentence or releasing on bail as seems appropriate. The review court decides the issue on the basis of real and substantial justice, not necessarily according to strict law.S v Ndlovu 1998 (1) SACR 599 (W). The review court does not have the power to increase the sentence.Attorney-General, Venda v Maraga 1992 (2) SACR 594 (V) at 596.S v Msindo 1980 (4) SA 263 (B). If the trial court has imposed an invalid sentence, however‚Äîif, for example, it has ignored a mandatory sentence‚Äîthe High Court imposes a proper sentence, which may have the effect of an increase.S v Msindo. The review court may substitute the conviction for a more serious offence, but should give notice to the accused before doing so.S v E. = Special review = When a magistrate has imposed a sentence not automatically reviewable, or where a regional court has imposed any sentence, and it comes to the notice of the High Court or any judge that proceedings were not in accordance with justice, the judge or High Court has same powers as if it were an automatic review under s 302. This is known as a special review.s 304(4). In practice, judges intervene in this way after the magistrate or regional magistrate in question, or a colleague or superior, or the DPP, discovers that something is wrong and brings it to the judge's attention, or even after the judge gets information from outside: from the press, for example, or from a concerned member of the public.See, for example, S v Saayman and S v Ndlovu. Special review is not possible if there has been an acquittal.Director of Public Prosecutions, KwaZulu-Natal v The Regional Magistrate, Vryheid 2009 (2) SACR 117 (KZP). If there has been an acquittal, the only way a case can go on review is via section 24 of the Supreme Court Act.See below. = Review before sentence = Prior to the introduction of section 304A, the common law applied, permitting no review under sections 302 to 304 until after sentencing. Now there may be a review before sentence if the magistrate or regional magistrate is of the view that an irregularity has taken place. = Section 307 = In terms of section 307, execution of sentence is not suspended by transmission of a case for review, unless the sentencing court releases the accused on bail. = Review in terms of section 24 of Supreme Court Act = Review of proceedings in lower courts may be brought to the High Court by way of section 24 of the Supreme Court Act. Grounds for such reviews are * the absence of jurisdiction on the part of the court; * an interest in the cause, bias, malice or corruption on the part of the presiding judicial officer; * a gross irregularity in the proceedings; and * the admission of inadmissible or incompetent evidence, or the rejection of admissible or competent evidence. The procedure for bringing such reviews before the High Court is set out in Rule 53 of the High Court Rules. Where the accused complains of irregularities in the proceedings, these may be the subject of an appeal as well. This is especially appropriate if there is an attack on the conviction or sentence as well as a contention of irregularity. Where the alleged irregularity is not revealed in the trial record‚Äîfor example, if there is an allegation that the presiding officer was \\"got at\\" outside the court‚Äîthen review in terms of section 24 of the Supreme Court Act is the appropriate route.See Lutchmia v The State 1979 (3) SA 699 (T). There are wider grounds for interfering on automatic review than in the case of a true review under section 24 of the Supreme Court Act. Automatic review is a hybrid of pure review and appeal. The following are some further distinctions between appeals and reviews: * There are time limits for noting appeals, but reviews have to be brought only within a reasonable time. * The disposal of a review does not preclude an appeal; once an appeal has been disposed of, however, there may be no review.R v Parmanand 1954 (3) SA 833 (A). Note, though, the different approach, in light of section 173 of the Constitution, in Hansen v Regional Magistrate, Cape Town1999 (2) SACR 430 (C). and S v Sawman.2001 (1) SACR 649 (E). Section 24 of the Supreme Court Act also makes provision for review of other tribunals, etc. Such reviews are more properly within the scope of administrative law.  Prosecution of crime  In South Africa, the primary authority and responsibility for the prosecution of crime lies with the State.Constitution s 179 (2).NPAA s 20 (1).See Du Toit Commentary. This is in contrast to the position in some other countries: the United Kingdom, for example, where there are many private prosecutions and police prosecutions. From this it follows that, in South Africa, a complainant or victim, or grieving relatives, do not generally have the power to force a State prosecution, or to prevent the State from prosecuting. Nor does the decision lie with the police or politicians, nor with the public at large. The views of these people do have some relevance, as they may create pressure to prosecute, but the final decision lies not with them, but with the prosecuting authority. In S v Zuma, the accused stood trial on one count of rape. During the course of the trial, application was made on behalf of three entities for an order admitting them, as amici curiae. The court held that none of the three could contribute to any fact relevant to the incident. In addition, the application was opposed by both the State and the defence; it appeared that the complainant herself was not in favour of the application. The court held that it was not apparent from the founding and supporting affidavits how the applicants could assist the court in matters that were to be decided on a factual basis, as the State had already tendered evidence on all the aspects that the applicants now wished to raise in their evidence and submissions. The court held that the public may not drive the system as part of the process; the public may only lobby or apply pressure in a similar way. The public at large is not entitled to assume the status required to be formally involved in the process. Among the implications of the above is that * the victim of a crime cannot force prosecution by the State; * the victim of a crime cannot prevent prosecution by the State; and * the victim of a crime (or an outside party or amicus curiae) is not entitled to intervene in the prosecution. In NDPP v Zuma, the court held that the Attorney-General is required by convention to make prosecutorial decisions without regard to political considerations, and may not subject his discretionary authority to that of government. He is also not responsible to government to justify the exercise of his discretion, because this political office has judicial attributes. The NPAA requires members of the prosecuting authority to serve impartially, and to exercise, carry out or perform their powers, duties and functions in good faith and without fear, favour or prejudice, subject only to the Constitution and the law. It further provides that no-one may interfere improperly with the National Prosecuting Authority in the performance of its duties and functions. = Private prosecution = The general position, then, is that the complainant does not have the power to force a State prosecution. To this generalisation, there are two main exceptions, provided for by the CPA, although they are only allowed in very strict circumstances: * prosecution by a private individual;s 7. and * private prosecution by a person or statutory body upon whom or upon which the power to prosecute is expressly conferred by statute.s 8.  By a private individual  The two requirements for prosecution by a private individual, under section 7 of the CPA, are as follows: # The DPP must have declined to prosecute at the public instance;s 7(1). and # the individual seeking to prosecute (who must be a private person, not a corporate body) must prove some substantial and peculiar interest in the issue, arising out of some injury personally suffered.s 7(1)(a). It ought to be noted that certain categories of personsSee s 7(1)(b)-(d). have the right to institute prosecution on behalf of others to whom they stand in a special relationship: * a husband, if the offence was committed in respect of his wife; * the wife or child, or (if there is no wife or child) any of the next of kin of any deceased person, if that person's death is alleged to have been caused by the offence in question; and * the legal guardian or curator of a minor or \\"lunatic,\\" if the offence was committed against the latter. These extensions are worded archaically. There is no extension of the right to a wife if the offence was committed in respect of her husband; the reference to \\"lunatics\\" has now been altered to refer to the \\"mentally ill.\\" = Nolle prosequi certificate = One prerequisite for a private prosecution is a certificate nolle prosequi, issued by the DPP.s 7(2)(a). With this the DPP certifies that he has seen the statements or affidavits on which the charge is based, and declines to prosecute at the public instance. The DPP is obliged to produce such a certificate when he has declined to prosecute, and the person intending to prosecute instead has requested such a certificate.s 7(2)(b). One school of thought has is that the DPP is obliged to issue this certificate because it is not for him to go into the merits of whether the particular private person has the capacity to bring private prosecution. The case of Singh v Minister of Justice, however, shows the other side of the coin. The applicant in that case had been expelled from his post in the Directorate of Special Operations, and subsequently had been prosecuted for defeating the ends of justice on various counts arising from alleged offences committed in the course of his duties as an investigator. This prosecution failed, as the trial court granted a permanent stay of prosecution on the grounds that the evidence against the applicant had been obtained illegally. After this, Singh laid criminal charges against various persons who had instigated his prosecution. The NDPP decided not to prosecute, and informed the applicant accordingly, leaving the court to deal with the question of whether or not Singh was entitled to a certificate nolle prosequi. The court held that Singh did not fit the requirements for private prosecution, so the DPP was not obliged to issue the certificate. There had been no averment in Singh's affidavit that he had complied with the requirements of section 7(1); the affidavit was incomplete, as none of the annexures referred to therein had been attached. The court, therefore, could not assess the veracity of the allegations, whether Singh had a substantial and peculiar interest, and whether such interest arose out of some personal injury. Therefore, the court held that Singh had failed to discharge the onus of proving that he was a private person falling within the ambit of section 7(1). The court held further that the unrestricted meaning of a \\"private person\\" contended for by Singh was inconsistent with the recognition that private prosecutions were unusual; it was also a departure from the basic law that criminal prosecutions must be conducted by a public prosecutor. Accordingly, the NDPP had not been obliged, simply by the provisions of section 7(2), to issue a certificate nolle prosequi once he had declined to prosecute. The nolle prosequi certificate will lapse if private prosecution is not instituted within three months.s 7(2)(d). The intention here is likely to protect the possible accused from having the certificate waved over his or her head indefinitely. = Procedural issues = The private prosecutor must provide security for the costs of the private prosecution.s 9. This money must be deposited with the magistrate's court in whose area of jurisdiction the offence was committed. The amount comprises * an amount determined by the Minister (R1,500 in terms of the Government Gazette of 14 February 2003) as security that he will prosecute the charge to a conclusion without undue delay; and * an amount such court may determine as security for the costs which may be incurred in respect of the accused's defence to the charge. Private prosecutions are to be instituted in the name of the private prosecutor, not in the name of the State.s 10. This means that all process in connection therewith is also issued in his name. The indictment, the charge-sheet or the summons must reflect the private prosecutor's name and bear his signature (or that of his legal representative). Two or more persons shall not prosecute the same charge except where two or more persons have been injured by the same offence. The accused may be brought before a lower court by summons only, and before a High Court by way of indictment only. In other words, the accused may not be arrested as means of ensuring his court attendance.s 12(1). (The accused may, however, be put under arrest in respect of an offence in respect of which a right of private prosecution is vested in any body or person under section 8.) If the accused pleads guilty to the charge after prosecution is instituted in terms of section 7, the State is obliged to take over the prosecution.s 12(2). The usual grounds for having refused to prosecute in the first place is a lack of evidence; if, however, the accused has pleaded guilty, there is obviously some merit in the allegation. The State only becomes involved, though, once the court is satisfied that the plea of guilty is appropriate and genuine. The DPP may at any stage apply to the court to stop all further proceedings so that prosecution may be instituted or continued at the instance of the State.s 13. The court may award costs to a successful private prosecutor,s 15. or against an unsuccessful private prosecutor.s 16.  In terms of section 8  Certain provincial ordinances give the right of prosecution for certain offences to municipalities and the like; other legislation may give similar rights to other bodies or persons. This right may be exercised only after the DPP has withdrawn his or her right to prosecute in respect of offences or classes of offences which are covered by the statutory right to prosecute privately under this section. No certificate nolle prosequi as such is required. The prosecution is instituted in the name of the prosecuting body: Makana Municipality v Smuts, for example. Section 426 of the Companies ActAct 61 of 1973. includes a special provision relating to private prosecutions for certain offences under that legislation. Section 23(5) of the ESTA provides another example of special provisions relating to private prosecutions. = Structure of State prosecuting authorityDu Toit Commentary. = There is a single national prosecuting authority.Constitution s 179.NPAA s 2. The structure of the prosecuting authority is set out in detail in the NPA Act. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) is at its head. Under the NDPP, there are several Deputy NDPPs. Each area of High Court jurisdiction is headed by a Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who replace what was previously know a Attorney General, who are under the overall control of the NDPP. NDPP sets the policy framework of the NPA. The NDPP, Deputy NDPPs and DPPs are appointed by the President of the Republic. The Minister appoints Deputy DPPs to assist DPPs with their work.s 15 of NPAA. Deputy DPPs have, subject to control of their DPPs, the same powers as DPPs. The NDPP appoints prosecutors.s 16 of NPAA. Prosecutors do the hands-on work under control of DPPs. Each magistrate's court has one or more prosecutors, depending on its size. The biggest, Johannesburg, has well over 100. Prosecutors do prosecutions in the district magistrate's courts and in magistrate court of the Regional Division. DPPs also have a number of prosecutors on their own staff, known as state advocates. They perform High Court prosecutions, appeal from lower courts, and also spend much time assisting with the decision process in cases referred to the DPP for decision. They also handle representations from the public. Most decisions on criminal cases are taken by prosecutors in the lower courts, who lead extremely busy lives. In the more serious or difficult cases, in terms of standing instructions, prosecutors refer their decisions to their area DPPs. Before any prosecutor can act as such, he must have written authority to prosecute from his DPP.NPAA s 20(5). All prosecutors have to take an oath of office before acting as such.s 32. Issues such as the role and position of the prosecuting authority are very topical, especially in the light of recent cases involving President Jacob Zuma.See especially NDPP v Zuma.  Ethics  All prosecutors are under a heavy ethical burden.See Du Toit Commentary.R v Stinchcombe.Shabalala v Attorney-General.Transvaal Phato v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape.See also S v Yengeni and Rozani v DPP. They are sometimes referred to as \\"ministers of truth,\\" since they are not there to secure a conviction at any cost; they must instead take into account the broader public interest and the interests of fairness in their quest to protect the truth. In R v Stinchcombe, Stinchcombe was a lawyer charged with breach of trust, theft and fraud. A former secretary of his was a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry, where she gave evidence apparently favourable to the defence. After the preliminary inquiry, but prior to trial, the witness was interviewed by an RCMP officer and a tape-recorded statement taken. Later, during the course of the trial, the witness was again interviewed by a police officer; a written statement was taken. Stinchcombe was informed of the existence, but not of the content, of the statements. His requests for disclosure were refused. During the trial, he learned that the witness would not be called by the Crown, and sought an order that the witness be called, or that the Crown disclose the contents of the statements to the defence. The trial judge dismissed the application, the trial proceeded, and Stinchcombe was convicted of breach of trust and fraud. Conditional stays were entered with respect to the theft counts Stinchcombe appealed. The appellate court held that the Crown has a legal duty to disclose all relevant information to the defence. The fruits of the investigation, in its possession, are not the property of the Crown, for use in securing a conviction; they are the property of the public, to be used to ensure that justice is done. The obligation to disclose is subject to a discretion with respect to the withholding of information, and to the timing and manner of disclosure. Crown counsel had a duty to respect the rules of privilege and to protect the identity of informers; a discretion must also be exercised with respect to the relevance of information. The Crown's discretion was reviewable by the trial judge, who should be guided by the general principle that information should not be withheld if there is a reasonable possibility that it will impair the right of the accused to make full answer and defence. The absolute withholding of information which is relevant to the defence can only be justified on the basis of the existence of a legal privilege which excludes the information from disclosure. This privilege is reviewable, however, on the ground that it is not a reasonable limit on the right to make full answer and defence in a particular case. The court held that all statements obtained from persons who have provided relevant information to the authorities, even if they are not proposed as Crown witnesses, should be produced. The court accordingly found that Crown counsel was not justified in refusing disclosure on the ground that the witness was not worthy of credit: Whether the witness is credible is for the trial judge to determine after hearing the evidence. The trial judge ought to have examined the statements. Since the information withheld might have affected the outcome of the trial, the failure to disclose impaired the right to make full answer and defence. The court held, therefore, that there should be a new trial, at which the statements were to be produced. In Shabalala v Attorney-General, Transvaal, the applicants had been indicted to stand trial in a Provincial Division on a charge of murder. Before the trial, various applications were made to the trial court on behalf of the applicants, including an application that they be given copies of the relevant police dockets. The court refused the applications, holding that the applicants had not satisfied it that the documents were \\"required\\" by them, within the meaning of section 23 of the Constitution, \\"for the exercise of any of their rights to a fair trial.\\" It was held that what a fair trial might require depends on the circumstances of each particular case; it is for the trial court to exercise a proper discretion in this regard. The court held that an accused is ordinarily entitled to have access to those documents in the police docket which are exculpatory (or which are prima facie likely to be helpful to the defence)‚Äîunless, in very rare cases, the State is able to justify the refusal of such access on the grounds that it is not justified for the purposes of a fair trial. Ordinarily the right to a fair trial would include access to the statements of witnesses (whether or not the State intended calling such witnesses) and such of the contents of the docket as are relevant in order to enable an accused person properly to exercise that right. The prosecution might, however, in a particular case, be able to justify the denial of such access on the grounds that it was not justified for the purposes of a fair trial. This would depend on the circumstances of each case. The court noted that the State is entitled to resist a claim by the accused for access to any particular document in the police docket * on the ground that such access was not justified for the purposes of enabling the accused properly to exercise his or her right to a fair trial; * on the ground that it had reason to believe that there was a reasonable risk that access to the relevant document would lead to the disclosure of the identity of an informer, or disclosure of State secrets; or * on the ground that there was a reasonable risk that such disclosure might lead to the intimidation of witnesses or otherwise prejudice the proper ends of justice. In this regard, the court has a discretion. The appellant in S v Yengeni was initially charged with corruption and fraud. After plea negotiations with the State, he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of an alternative charge of fraud. Accordingly he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Yengeni filed a review application against sentence on the basis that the NDPP and Minister of Justice had agreed to see to it that he would be sentenced to no more than a fine of R5,000 if he pleaded guilty to fraud. The court held that, even if an agreement had been concluded as alleged, it would have been fundamentally incapable of being performed, as any attempt to fetter the court's discretion on sentence would be in conflict with the fundamental constitutional principle of the independence of the judiciary. It would also blur the clear distinction between a prosecutorial decision, which was part of the executive's competence, and the sentencing power, which was a judicial power. The court expressed disgust at the possibility that such an agreement could have been concluded, as the NDPP ought to be impartial and not politically motivated. The court noted that the purported agreement was to be distinguished from a plea-bargaining agreement, since the latter was expressly subject to the court's finding that the agreement was just, which decision was made by the court independently of the parties to the agreement. The review application was therefore dismissed. Phato v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape dealt with two applications, combined for the purposes of the judgment. The issue was the right of an accused to access to the police docket relating to the accused's impending trial in a magistrate's court on a charge under the Witchcraft Suppression Act.Act 3 of 1957. In the first application, the applicant was the accused, who contended that he was entitled to this information by virtue of the provisions of sections 23 and 25(3) of the Constitution. In the second application, the applicant was the Commissioner of the SAPS, who desired an order declaring that the privilege which existed in respect of the contents of police dockets immediately prior to the commencement of the Constitution was not repealed or amended by section 23, but that the accused was entitled before trial only to copies of * all medical, hospital and autopsy reports; * summaries of other expert evidence to be tendered by the State; and * copies of all documents relating to identification parades. The Commissioner argued that the State was only required to furnish an accused with such information as he required, in the narrow sense, to exercise his right to a fair trial: that is to say, a trial in an adversarial system of litigation which recognises various privileges from disclosure of information to the other side as being paramount to its proper operation. This included the docket privilege. The Court held that the practices of the past, whereby the State retained tight control of almost all available information relevant to a criminal prosecution, was inconsistent with modern values of openness and accountability in a democratically oriented administration. The court held that section 23 gave an accused the right to access to the information contained in the police docket for the exercise and protection of his right to a fair criminal trial. The Commissioner argued that Stinchcombe permitted non- disclosure of witness statements on grounds of privilege, and that this privilege included the docket privilege in South African law. The court held that, whereas in Canada the State had a discretion to withhold information which would ordinarily be disclosed, the South African Constitution's inclusion of section 23 means there is a protected right to information. The court therefore ordered that the respondents furnish the applicant with witness statements, and with all exhibits, plans and diagrams in the police docket, if any, and that they also give the applicant access to the remaining information in the docket.  Opening a docket  Prosecutors usually make their decisions on evidence gathered by the police; in exceptional cases, by special investigative agencies. When a crime is reported to the police, a police docket is opened. The fruits of the investigation are all contained in the docket, in the form of * witness statements, usually under oath; * documentary evidence (the cheque in a fraud case, for example); * warning statements of the accused; * a list of the accused's previous convictions; * correspondence in connection with the investigation; and * an investigation diary. Prosecutors often ask the police to do further investigation along certain lines: for example, to investigate further a possible defence revealed in an accused's warning statement. Prosecutors take their decisions on the strength of what is in the docket. If a case goes to trial, prosecutors are not obliged to lead all the evidence in the docket.R v Helibron. The amount of evidence led depends on the circumstances. The evidence of ten different witnesses need not be led if the evidence of one will suffice because it is not contradicted. The prosecutor, however, is still obliged to disclose all evidence to the accused. In R v Heilbron, the licensee of Empire Bar, Heilbron, was charged with two counts of contravention of a Liquor Ordinance, for permitting drunkenness and for permitting his place to be the habitual resort or place of meeting of reputed prostitutes. He was acquitted on the first count and convicted on the second. He brought an appeal on several grounds, but the most important for present purposes is his contention that certain persons whose names were mentioned in the evidence as prostitutes who resorted to this place were not called as witnesses. The court held that there was very strong evidence against Heilbron, and that, where there is a crucial witness, the Crown should either call him or render him available: What is \\"crucial\\" depends on the circumstances of the case. The prostitutes who were not called, the court found, were not crucial witnesses. Furthermore, it was not shown how Heilbron was prejudiced by their not being called; it was open to Heilbron, who had all these names before him, to call the witnesses himself. His appeal, therefore, was dismissed. = Withdrawal or stopping of prosecutionSee CPA s 6. = Before the plea, the prosecutors may withdraw a case, in which event * the accused is not entitled to a verdict; and * prosecution may subsequently be re-instituted.s 6(a). After the plea, however, the case may no longer be withdrawn. The prosecution may be stopped after the plea, however, provided that the prosecutor has the necessary authority from the DPP.s 6(b). In this event, * the accused is entitled to an acquittal; and * prosecution may not be re-instituted against the accused in the future. In S v Magayela, the prosecutor had closed the State's case without calling a crucial witness. The accused was thereupon discharged. The matter was referred to the High Court, at the request of the complainant, for review of the acquittal. The State contended that the prosecutor had not been authorised to stop the prosecution, and that the decision to close the State's case had amounted to a stopping of the prosecution; the acquittal ought therefore to be set aside and the case referred back to the court a quo to complete the trial. The court held that the accused had not been discharged because of the prosecutor's action when the matter had still been in his hands; the prosecutor had no intention of stopping the prosecution. Furthermore, even if he had known that closing the State case would inevitably lead to discharge, that was the route he had followed. The magistrate had discharged the accused not because he had no control over the matter, but because he had made a finding that on the evidence there was no case against the accused. He had not been bound by any stopping of the prosecution by the prosecutor. Even if the prosecutor would in both cases (stopping the prosecution or closing the State case) have been moved by the same considerations, there was a clear distinction in principle between the two procedures and their consequences. Accordingly, the court held that the acquittal could not be set aside. In S v Gouws, after the accused had pleaded not guilty to a charge of defeating the ends of justice, the prosecutor closed the State's case without calling any witnesses. In the prosecutor's opinion, the accused had pleaded to the wrong charge. The magistrate found the accused not guilty and discharged him. The matter was referred to the High Court on special review, on the basis that the prosecutor's actions amounted to a stopping of the prosecution, and that, in terms of section 6(b) of the CPA, this could be done only with the consent of the DPP. Among the questions that fell to be determined was whether there was any duty on the court to enquire, under such circumstances, whether the prosecutor was indeed stopping the prosecution and, if so, whether he or she had the necessary consent to do so. The court held that the mere acceptance of a plea could not amount to a stoppage of the prosecution in the manner contemplated in section 6(b) of the CPA. A prosecutor who accepted a plea was doing no more than taking a day-to-day decision which all prosecutors were called upon to take in the course of their duties. Furthermore, there was no duty on a court to enquire into whether or not a prosecutor who accepted an accused person's plea, or who decided not to call witnesses, or further witnesses, was thereby stopping the proceedings. All that a prosecutor was doing under such circumstances was leaving before the court whatever had been placed before it up to that stage: It was then up to the court to make a decision. The court noted that it would cause an accused person great concern to hear a magistrate questioning whether or not it was appropriate for the State to call no further evidence. He might understandably believe that the court wanted him or her to be convicted. The court held that a successful application by the State for the setting aside of an acquittal, based on the grounds that the prosecutor had failed to obtain the necessary approval before stopping the proceedings, would be tantamount to giving the State \\"a second bite at the cherry.\\" The judgment of the court a quo, the verdict of \\"not guilty,\\" was therefore confirmed. = Prosecution within reasonable time, and prescription = The accused is entitled to be prosecuted within a reasonable time. There are three main provisions dealing with the issue of prescription in this context: # section 18 of the CPA; # section 35(3)(d) of the Constitution; and # section 342A of the CPA.  CPA s 18  All crimes, with certain exceptions for the most serious of crimes, prescribe after 20 years.CPA s 18. Prosecution after this period may no longer be instituted. The exceptions are for * murder; * treason during a time of war; * robbery with aggravating circumstances; * kidnapping; * child-stealing; * rape or compelled rape; * the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes; * trafficking in persons for sexual purposes; * using a child or person who is mentally disabled for pornographic purposes.See Mattaeus De Criminibus 48, 19, 4, 1. These exceptions evolved from the Roman-Dutch law. The case of S v De Freitas sets out their history. In the Cape, murder was excluded in 1828; this position was perpetuated throughout the Republic until 1971, when the new CPA, instead of excluding specific offences from the operation of prescription, provided that prescription would not bar prosecution for offences \\"in respect of which the sentence of death may be imposed.\\" At the time, the death sentence was competent for the offences of murder, treason, kidnapping, child- stealing, rape, robbery or attempted robbery with aggravating circumstances, and housebreaking with aggravating circumstances. In addition there were the provisions of terrorist and sabotage legislation, which empowered the court to impose the same sentence as that for treason. In 1982, the Internal Security Act abolished these provisions, but introduced the death sentence as a competent sentence for the offence of \\"terrorism\\" as defined in the Act. In 1990 housebreaking was removed from the list. In 1995, the Constitutional Court held, in S v Makwanyane, that the Constitution had abolished the death sentence in respect of the crimes of murder, robbery or attempted robbery, kidnapping, child-stealing and rape. The court declined, however, to express any view with regard to the death sentence for treason committed during wartime. The court held that the provisions of section 18 of the CPA were clear and unambiguous, and provided for the lapsing of the right to prosecute after the expiration of a period of twenty years from the date of the offence in the case of every crime other than one in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed. By linking section 18 to those offences which were at the relevant date capital offences, Parliament clearly accepted that the list of such offences could change, and that the prescriptive provisions of section 18, as it was to be applied at a relevant date, would apply to those crimes which were not on the list of capital offences at that date. The twenty-year prescription period may be interrupted only by the service of documents, such as summons. If, therefore, an accused is able to evade the law for twenty years, he will have gotten away with it. The question is open as to whether or not prescription operates in the case of a person who has committed one of the listed exceptional crimes after the coming into operation of the Interim Constitution in 1994, where the twenty-year period lapsed before the amended section 18 took effect in 1997. As Les Roberts has argued,\\"Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act: the balance between hope and dread\\" 2004 SALJ. the purpose of the prescription in the criminal law is to limit criminal accusations so that potential accused persons are not \\"perpetually [...] in suspense between hope and dread.\\" The twenty-year period runs even if the prosecuting authorities are unaware of the crime. Although the effect of section 18 seems clear, writes Roberts, the exact legal nature of the provision is more elusive: * When does the right of the state to prosecute a particular crime lapse? * Does the alleged perpetrator acquire a corresponding right not to be prosecuted? * If so, what is the nature of that right? In South Africa, civil prescription affects remedies, not rights, and is therefore part of the law of procedure, not the substantive law. Various differences between civil and criminal prescription (like interruption, suspension and waiver), as well as the different policy considerations involved, lead Roberts to the conclusion that the Corpus Juris Secundum was correct in holding that criminal prescription confers a substantive right on the perpetrator not to be prosecuted. Substantive provisions, as opposed to procedural ones, do not operate retrospectively in the absence of clear indication to the contrary. In its original form, section 18 excluded crimes for which the death penalty could be imposed from the ambit of the twenty-year prescription period. Due to the Interim Constitution's commencement, and the death penalty's being struck down in S v Makwanyane, the list of crimes for which the death sentence could be imposed shrank to the solitary crime of high treason in time of war. The clear effect of this, argues Roberts, is that section 18 of the CPA excepted only treason in time of war from the prescription period. This was confirmed in S v De Freitas, where the court accepted the accused's argument that the effect of Makwanyane was that rape now prescribed after twenty years. The amendments to the CPA came into operation in 1998, subsequent to the decision in S v De Freitas, and included the current list of exceptions to the twenty-year prescription period, which happen to be the same crimes as those for which the death sentence could have been imposed prior to 1994. Furthermore, it was specified in section 27 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act that the new section 18 be deemed to come into operation on 27 April 1994. The question, for Roberts, is whether this retroactivity will pass constitutional muster. If the retrospectivity is struck down, all crimes occurring between Makwanyane and the amendment to section 18 will fall into a lacuna.  Constitution s 35(3)(d)  In terms of section 35(3)(d) of the Constitution, every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right to have their trial begin and conclude without unreasonable delay.Sanderson v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape.Wild v Hoffert.Bothma v Els.S v Van der Vyver. The concept of \\"unreasonableness\\" is not defined; the question is left open to interpretation. As this right falls under the entitlement to a fair trial, a deliberate delay in bringing an accused before court will not be entertained. The Constitution refers specifically to an \\"accused person.\\" Only once a person has been accused of a crime, therefore, does he benefit from this right. There is some debate as to whether this right extends to the institution of a prosecution in the first place, or merely covers the situation where someone has been formally charged. In extreme cases, the court may grant a permanent stay of prosecution, if the prosecution is not brought within a reasonable time.Sanderson v Attorney- General, Eastern Cape.Broom√® v DPP, Western Cape.McCarthy v Additional Magistrate, Johannesburg. = Sanderson v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape = In Sanderson v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape, the Child Protection Unit of the SAPS had received information, at the end of October 1994, that the appellant, the deputy head of a primary school and a well-known singer in local church and musical entertainment circles, had allegedly sexually interfered with two girls who, at the time, had been standard-five pupils at his school. On 1 December 1994, the appellant appeared at the office of the investigating officer. There he was informed that he was suspected of contravening the Sexual Offences Act. He denied the accusation and declined to make a statement. He was informally arrested and released on warning. On 2 December 1994, the appellant appeared in court and was released on his own recognisance until early in the new year, with no charge having been put to him and without his being called upon to plead. On 7 August 1995, the decision was made to prosecute the appellant on two charges. The matter was set down for hearing over five days during the December 1995 school holidays. As one of the alleged incidents had occurred outside the jurisdiction of the trial court, it was necessary to obtain a ministerial directive to enable all the charges to be heard in the Port Elizabeth regional court. The ministerial directive was delayed, resulting in the trial's being postponed to 1 July 1996. On 10 May 1996, after many requests, a charge-sheet was served on the appellant for the first time. In June 1996, a reply to a request for further particulars to the charge-sheet, together with various other documents, was supplied to the defence. The prosecution added an extra charge (which was subsequently withdrawn). The defence anticipated the trial date and applied for a postponement; the trial was duly postponed to October 1996. As certain State witnesses were unavailable during that time, the prosecution applied for a further postponement, so the trial was postponed to December 1996. On 12 November 1996, the appellant applied to a Local Division for an order permanently staying the proceedings against him, and permanently prohibiting the respondent from re-instituting any prosecution against him in respect of the same charges. The crux of the appellant's case was that an unreasonable and inexcusable delay in the prosecution of this matter had resulted in a serious infringement of his right to a speedy trial as contained in s25(3)(a) of the interim Constitution. In particular the appellant relied on two broad categories of prejudice: # \\"social prejudice,\\" or the harm that had befallen him other than in relation to the actual court proceedings against him, and including the very substantial embarrassment and pain he suffered as a result of the negative publicity engendered by the nature of the charges, coupled with his occupation and prominent position in society; and # his own emotional and personal reactions of anxiety and stress, which necessitated the use of medically prescribed tranquillisers and sleeping tablets, together with the great strain placed on his limited financial resources by the drawn-out proceedings. Although the Local Division found that there had indeed been an unreasonable delay and significant social prejudice, it dismissed the application after balancing the appellant's right to a speedy trial against society's interest in bringing suspected criminals to book. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court, which considered the meaning of \\"within a reasonable time\\" in section 25(3)(a). The rights primarily protected were perceived to be * liberty; * security; and * trial- related interests. The court noted that the very nature of the criminal justice system was aimed at punishing only those whose guilt had been established in a fair trial, prior to which the accused was presumed innocent. The difficulty was that an accused person was subject to various forms of prejudice and penalty merely by virtue of being an accused. In addition to forms of social prejudice, the accused was also subjected to invasions of liberty, ranging from incarceration, or onerous bail conditions, to repeated attendance at remote courts for formal postponements. In determining whether a lapse of time was reasonable, the court considered the \\"balancing test\\" formulated in the American case of Barker v Wingo, in terms of which the conduct of the prosecution and the accused were weighed up, and the following considerations examined: * the length of the delay; * the reasons the government assigned to justify the delay; * the accused's assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and * the prejudice to the accused. The court expressed a need for circumspection, however, in relying on foreign precedent. The South African society and criminal justice system differed from those in other jurisdictions. The test for establishing whether the time lapse was reasonable should not be unduly stratified or preordained, as it was not helpful for the court to impose semi-formal time constraints on the prosecuting authority: That was law-making function, which it would be inappropriate for the court to exercise. It was a fair, although tentative, generalisation that the lapse of time heightened the various kinds of prejudice that section 25(3)(a) sought to diminish. The court considered three of the most important factors bearing on the enquiry: * the nature of the prejudice suffered by the accused; * the nature of the case; and * systemic delay.  Nature of the prejudice  The more serious the prejudice suffered by the accused, the shorter had to be the time within which the accused was tried. In principle, the continuing enforcement of this should tend to compel the State to prioritise cases in a rational way. If the accused had been the primary agent of delay, he should not be able to rely on it in vindicating his rights under section 25(3)(a): for example where he had sought postponements or delayed the prosecution in ways that were less formal.  Nature of the case  The court held that it was not appropriate to specify \\"normal delays\\" for specific kinds of cases. This was better done by the Legislature. It is not simply a matter of contrasting simple and complex cases. The prosecution should be aware of inherent delays and factor them into the decision of when to charge a suspect. There should be proportionality between the kind of sentences available for a crime and the prejudice suffered by the accused. For example, pre-trial incarceration of five months for a crime whose maximum sentence was six months clearly pointed in the direction of unreasonableness.  Systemic delay  This includes the resource limitations that hampered the effectiveness of the police investigation or the prosecution of the case, and the delay caused by court congestion. While more excusable than individual derelictions of duty, there had to come a time when systemic causes could no longer be regarded as exculpatory. In principle courts should not allow claims of systemic delay to render the right nugatory.  Value judgment  Having isolated some of the relevant considerations, the court recognised that \`reasonableness' required a value judgment. In making the judgment, the court had to be mindful of the profound social interest in bringing the person charged with a crime to trial, and resolving the liability of the accused. Delay could not be allowed to debase the presumption of innocence and become in itself a form of extra-curial punishment. In addition not this, the public interest was served by bringing litigation to finality.  Permanent stay of prosecution  A stay, the court found, is seldom warranted in the absence of significant prejudice to the accused. Ordinarily, and particularly where the prejudice was not trial-related, there were a range of \\"appropriate\\" remedies less radical, including * a mandamus requiring the prosecution to commence the case; * a refusal to grant the prosecution a postponement; * damages after an acquittal; and * a release from custody for an awaiting-trial prisoner who has been held too long. A bar was likely to be available only in a narrow range of circumstances: for example, where it was established that the accused had probably suffered irreparable trial prejudice as a result of the delay. As the appellant in this case was not in custody and had continued working, and as the postponements were to dates which suited him and did not require frequent attendances at court, and as he was legally represented and could have opposed the postponements earlier and with greater vigour, the court held that this was not an appropriate case for a stay of prosecution. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. The court held that the delay in this instance was not unreasonable. = Wilde v Hoffert = In Wilde v Hoffert, on 19 June 1993, the appellants were arrested on charges of dealing in or possessing cocaine, and attempted murder. After their first formal appearance in the magistrate's court, they were granted bail. There followed a series of remands, initially to amend the conditions of bail and thereafter at the request of the prosecution, \\"for further investigation.\\" On 5 October 1993, the matter was set down for trial in the week of 24 to 28 May 1994. When the trial date came around, the case was not ripe for hearing, and so was postponed until 4 October 1994. By that date, however, the application had been not completed, and therefore was postponed to 3 March 1995, but even by that date the application was no nearer resolution than it had been five months before; the matter was struck from the court roll. On 7 March 1995, the appellants withdrew their High Court application. On 10 November 1995, the appellants and the fourth respondent were summonsed to appear in the Regional Court in Durban ten days later on essentially the same drug-trafficking charge as before. The presiding magistrate dismissed the defence argument and granted the prosecution's application for the case to be postponed to 1 April 1996, for trial. On 13 March 1996, the appellants brought an application in the Natal High Court, claiming a stay of the prosecution. The High Court found that, while the Attorney-General was to blame for a substantial period of the delay in the prosecution, there were insufficient grounds for a stay of the prosecution in the absence of trial-related prejudice. The court acknowledged that the Constitution ranks the right to a speedy trial at the forefront of the requirements for a fair criminal trial. This means that the State is at all times, and in all cases, obligated to ensure that accused persons are not exposed to unreasonable delay in the prosecution of the cases against them. Prosecutors and presiding officers are constitutionally bound, therefore, to prevent infringement of the right to a speedy trial. Where such infringement does occur, or where it appears imminent, there is a duty to devise and implement an appropriate remedy or combination of remedies. What such remedy or remedies ought to be must be left to be determined in the light of the circumstances of each particular case. The court held that a stay of prosecution could not be granted in the absence of trial-related prejudice or extraordinary circumstances. The court agreed, then, with the decision in Sanderson v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape that a permanent stay of prosecution was not appropriate relief in these circumstances. = S v Van Der Vyver = In June 2005, the accused was arrested and charged with murder, and was granted bail. In September and December 2005, he made further appearances in the magistrate's court. At the last such appearance, the case was remanded to the High Court for trial on 9 October 2006, but on that date the State applied for a further postponement on the following grounds: * that the Court roll was overcrowded, and that part-heard cases had to be given priority over new cases; and * that the prosecutor assigned to the case was herself involved in one such part-heard matter. The defence opposed the postponement on the grounds of the accused's right to a speedy trial and to legal representation of his choice, and, further, applied for the matter to be struck off the roll if the State was unable to proceed. The court held that, when considering an application for an adjournment, it should be guided by two principles: # that it is in the interests of society that guilty persons should not evade conviction by reason of an oversight or because of a mistake that could be rectified; # that an accused person, deemed to be innocent, was entitled, once indicted, to be tried with expedition. The critical question was whether the lapse of time was reasonable, taking into consideration the nature of the prejudice suffered, the nature of the case, and the systematic delay. The court had a discretion, which was to be exercised judicially on consideration of the particular case's facts and circumstances. The areas of prejudice raised by the defence relating to finance, career advancement, widespread media coverage and social pressures on him and his family were not trial-related; they impacted on him personally, as they would on any accused involved in a high-profile trial. The court held, however, that the defence had also raised trial-related prejudices: *It was possible that the accused's legal representatives and expert witnesses would not be available if the trial were to commence on a postponed date. * The accused would probably incur substantial additional costs. * With the passage of time, the memories of witnesses could dim, which could negatively impact on the trial and on the administration of justice. The delay could not be ascribed, however, to a particular person or instance; it was due to a combination of factors, including the practice of continuing rolls, the overcrowding of rolls, the fact that certain matters had not been completed during the previous court term, the fact that certain prosecutors were unable to take on new matters, and the priority to be given to matters which were age-related, or where the accused were in custody. The court acknowledged that, where there had been an unreasonable delay in a matter, the court was empowered by section 342A(1) of the CPA to hold an inquiry and to give direction as to the future conduct of the case. Taking into account, however, all the relevant factors, including * the interests of society, the victim's family and the accused; * the fact that the accused was not in custody; * the duration of the delay; * the reasons for the postponement; * the nature and seriousness of the charge; and * the systematic shortcomings, it could not be found that the delay was unreasonable. The application for postponement was therefore granted. = Broome v DPP, Western Cape = In Broome v DPP, Western Cape, Broome was charged in the magistrate's court with fraud and contraventions of three statutes, due to offences committed from 1986 to 1994. Broome was a partner in charge of the audit by a firm of accountants of the OWT Group, and a director of the OWT Group. In 1994, the OWT Group was placed under curatorship. Certain documents were seized and were thereafter, at all times, under the control of the State. In 2003, Broome inspected the seized documents and found that a significant portion of the audit working papers originally seized from his firm had gone missing while under control of the State. Broome brought an application for an order permanently staying the prosecution based on section 35(3)(d) of the Constitution. It was averred that the unacceptable long delay in bringing the prosecution‚Äîthe investigation was completed in 1997 and prosecution only lodged in 2004‚Äîand the loss of audit records impaired B's ability to prepare and mount a proper defence to the charges. The regional court refused the application, holding that the critical question was how our courts determined whether a particular lapse of time was reasonable or unreasonable, and what the appropriate remedy was. In determining this question, the courts have adopted the \\"balancing test,\\" as decided in various decisions, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the accused were weighed and the following considerations examined: * the length of the delay; * the reasons the government assigned to justify the delay; * the accused's assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and * the prejudice to the accused. The court held that the delay had not been adequately explained, and was inexcusable. The prosecuting authority had been responsible for an undue and excessive delay; the fundamental right of Broome to a speedy trial had been infringed. Furthermore, the importance of the audit documents for Broome to mount a proper defence could not be ignored; they were necessary. The loss of a significant portion of these documents would have a critical prejudicial effect on Broome. He would suffer irreparable trial prejudice should the suit continue. This prejudice, the court found, was real, significant and trial- related. The question remained, therefore: Was a permanent stay of prosecution, in this case, the only appropriate remedy? The court held that the circumstances rendered this case so extraordinary that a stay of prosecution did present itself as the obvious and only remedy. A permanent stay of prosecution was granted accordingly. = McCarthy v Additional Magistrate, Johannesburg = In McCarthy v Additional Magistrate, Johannesburg, McCarthy had been unsuccessful in an application for an order * reviewing and setting aside a warrant for her arrest; and * for the indefinite stay of the proceedings against her in the case in a magistrate's court, in which an inquiry was to be held with a view to the surrender of McCarthy to the United States to stand trial for conspiracy to murder, allegedly committed in 1985. The original request to the South African authorities for the McCarthy's extradition was made in 1990. McCarthy was arrested on a warrant which was withdrawn on the following day, when a second warrant was issued and McCarthy was re-arrested. She was then was discharged after an objection was sustained that the documentary evidence filed in support of the application for extradition was deficient. In 1991, McCarthy was arrested on a third warrant. This was the warrant she wished to have set aside in casu. The matter was eventually heard in 1996, after postponements and much back and forth between the parties. It was contended, firstly, that the third warrant had been incorrectly issued, as the magistrate had not exercised the discretion bestowed upon him. The State had been obliged, when the third warrant of arrest was applied for, to disclose that there had been two previous warrants of arrest issued, that the first had been withdrawn, and that the second had culminated in the appellant's discharge. McCarthy also contended that she was entitled to the protection of section 25(3)(a) of the Interim Constitution: the right to a fair trial, which included the right to a trial within a reasonable time. She contended that, because of the various delays, her rights had been infringed; she was prejudiced in that the severe conditions attached to her release on bail had disrupted her studies, her personal life and her work. The court held that, although the State had not disclosed the previous applications and the appellant's discharge to the issuing magistrate, if these facts had been disclosed they would not have affected the magistrate's decision to grant a warrant. This contention was therefore rejected. In assessing whether or not there had been an unreasonable delay, the court divided up the period from the start of the proceedings until the present into three separate periods and examined each in turn: # September 1990 to November 1990, when McCarthy was arrested and subsequently discharged; # November 1990 to 8 November 1991, when McCarthy was arrested on the third warrant; and # November 1991 to the time of the present application. The first period was held to be reasonable; so, too, the second. Regarding the third, the court held that there had been systemic delays, but that they did not render nugatory McCarthy's right to have her trial begin and conclude without reasonable delay. The court further held that an indefinite stay would seldom be warranted in the absence of significant prejudice to the accused or extraordinary circumstances. McCarthy's appeal was therefore dismissed.  CPA s 342A  Section 342A of the CPA lists a number of measures to assist the courts in ensuring that trials are disposed of without undue delay. According to this section, a court shall investigate any delay in the completion of proceedings which appears to the court to be unreasonable, and which could case substantial prejudice to the prosecution, the accused or his legal advisor, the State or a witness. The factors that are to be considered in determining whether a delay is unreasonable are set out in subsections 342A(2)(a) to (i) of the CPA, and are as follows: * the duration of the delay; * the reasons advanced for the delay; * whether any person can be blamed for the delay; * the effect of the delay on the personal circumstances of the accused and witnesses; * the seriousness, extent or complexity of the charges; * actual or potential prejudice caused to the State or the defence by the delay, including ** a weakening of the quality of evidence; ** the possible death or disappearance or non-availability of witnesses; ** the loss of evidence; ** problems regarding the gathering of evidence; and ** considerations of cost; * the effect of the delay on the administration of justice; * the adverse effect on the interests of the public or the victims in the event of the prosecution being stopped or discontinued; and * any other factor which in the opinion of the court ought to be taken into account. There are also the measures set out in subsections 342A(3)(a) to (e), which are aimed at hastening the process. They are as follows: * refusing further postponement of the proceedings; * granting a postponement subject to any such conditions as the court may determine; * where the accused has not yet pleaded to the charge, ordering that the case be struck off the roll and the prosecution not be resumed or instituted de novo without the written instruction of the attorney-general; * where the accused has pleaded to the charge and the State or the defence is unable to proceed with the case, or refuses to do so, ordering that the proceedings be continued and disposed of as if the case for the prosecution or defence has been closed; * ordering that ** the state shall pay the accused concerned the wasted costs incurred as a result of an unreasonable delay caused by an officer employed by the State; ** the accused or his legal advisor shall pay the State wasted costs incurred; or ** the matter be referred to the appropriate authority for an administrative investigation and possible disciplinary action against any person responsible for the delay. It must be noted that, although the final measure, in section 342A(3)(e), is on the statute books, an order of costs against the State has never been made, as the financial implications are very onerous.  Search and seizure  The issue of search and seizure is mainly a statutory matter; it is dealt with in a variety of statutes. Sections 19 to 36 of the CPA (Chapter 2) set out the generic provisions governing the issue; other statutes, such as the Prevention of Crime Act and the South African Police Services Act, also deal with specific instances of search and seizure. Section 13(8) of the South African Police Services Act, for example, authorises roadblocks and searches. Most of the case authority in this topic deals, therefore, with the constitutionality of searches and seizures. = What may be searched and seized? = Chapter 2 of the CPA deals with the issue of search warrants, entering of premises, seizure, forfeiture and disposal of property connected with offences. Chapter 2 provides only generic provisions; it does not replace other search and seizure provisions in other laws,s 19. such as those mentioned above. In general, what may be seized is discussed in section 20 of the CPA: anything that is * which concerned in, or on reasonable grounds believed to be concerned in, an offence or a suspected offence, whether in South Africa or elsewhere; * which may afford evidence of an offence or a suspected offence, in South Africa or elsewhere; or * which is intended or reasonably believed to be intended to be used in the commission of an offence. As to what constitutes reasonable suspicion, see Mnyungula v Minister of Safety and Security. = General rule = The general rule is that seizure is permitted only in terms of a search warrant.s 21. Search warrants may generally be issued only by a magistrate or a justice of the peace. If, however, in the course of judicial proceedings, the article is required in evidence at such proceedings, the judge or presiding officer may issue the warrant. A regional magistrate does not have the authority to issue a search warrant, unless it is issued during the course of criminal proceedings before him or her.S v Dos Santos. Search warrants are to be contrued with reasonable strictness.Beheermaatschappij Helling I NV v Magistrate, Cape Town. The offence being investigated must be properly specified.Minister of Safety & Security v Van der Merwe. See Beheermaatschappij Helling I NV v Magistrate, Cape Town. = Search by police official = The search warrant requires a police official to effect the search.s 21(2).See Polonyfis v Provincial Commissioner. A warrant cannot authorise private persons to search. See Extra Dimension v Kruger. The search warrant is to be executed by day, unless the warrant clearly states the contrary.s 21(3). A search commenced by day does not become illegal once sun goes down, however. See Young v Minister of Safety & Security. The searched person, or any person whose rights are affected by the search warrant, is entitled to a copy of the warrant.s 21(4). If, therefore, you lend your car to someone who is subsequently pulled over, and the car is searched, both you and the person to whom you lent the car are entitled to copies of the warrant. Searched persons are only entitled to a copy of the warrant after its execution, however. The State is not obliged to give notice of intention to apply for a warrant, as this could easily defeat the very purpose of the warrant An operation to remove a bullet from a leg is not covered by search and seizure provisions. See Minister of Safety & Security v Xaba. An overbroad warrant does not necessarily lead to total invalidity.Polonyfis v Provincial Commissioner. Generally on searches with warrants, see Toich v Magistrate, Riversdale. = Exceptions = There are exceptions to the principle that a search warrant is required. One such exception is where the searched person gives his consent.s 22(a). Once consent is granted to search, it may not be withdrawn at the seizure stage. See Nel v Deputy Commissioner of Police, Grahamstown.See also S v Lachman and Magobodi v Minister. Another exception is where a police official reasonably believes that the warrant would be issued if he applied for it in the ordinary course of things, and that the delay in obtaining the warrant would defeat the object of the exercise.s 22(b). The person making an arrest may search the arrested person without a warrant.s 23. The person lawfully in charge or occupation of premises may, if he reasonably believes that certain categories of goods may be on such premises, search them for such goods without a warrant.s 24. Where state security may be endangered, and the police official believes reasonably * that it is necessary to search the premises; * that the warrant would have been issued if applied for; and * that the delay in obtaining the warrant would defeat its object, he may search without a warrant.s 25(3). A police official may enter premises without warrant to take a statement from anyone on such premises, but in the case of a private dwelling the consent of the occupier is also required. = Disposal of seized articles = The police official seizing an article * may make suitable disposal arrangements if the article is perishable;s 30(a). * may, if the article is stolen or is suspected to be stolen, return it to the person from whom it was stolen, if the person from whom it is seized so consents‚Äîin which case the person to whom article is returned must keep it available for any subsequent criminal proceedings;s 30(b). and * shall, if neither of the above two courses are followed, give distinctive identification and retain the article in police custody.s 30 (c). If no criminal proceedings are instituted, or if the article is not required for evidence or a court order in criminal proceedings, the article must be returned to the person from whom it was seized, if such person may lawfully possess it. If such person may not lawfully possess it, it goes to the person who may lawfully possess it.s 31(1)(a). If no-one may lawfully possess it, the article is forfeited to the State.s 31(1)(b). No person may lawfully possess drugs or an unlicensed firearm, for example. If criminal proceedings are instituted, and an admission of guilt is paid, the article is disposed of similarly to the case when there is no prosecution.s 32.See previous paragraph. If the trial has commenced, the article goes to court for trial.s 33. At the conclusion of the trial, the presiding officer must make an order as to the disposal of article.s 34. The article is returned to person from whom it was seized, if such person may lawfully possess it.s 34(1)(a). If such person is not entitled to it, or may not lawfully possess it, the article is to go to the person entitled thereto, if he may lawfully possess it.s 34(1)(b).The words \\"not entitled\\" indicate that we moving here into the realm of private law. If, for example, Xanadu steals Yeats's cellphone, Xanadu may lawfully possess the article, but is not entitled to it, since Yeats is the owner of the phone. If no person is entitled to or may lawfully possess the article, it is forfeited to State.s 34(1)(c). A court convicting a person may declare any \\"weapon, instrument or other article by means whereof the offence in question was committed, or which was used in the commission of such offence,\\" and which was seized under the provisions of the CPA, to be forfeited to State.s 35(1)(a). Similar provisions apply to any vehicle, container or other article used for a crime relating to illicit drugs or liquor, precious metals or stones, housebreaking or theft.s 35(1)(b). Section 35 further provides for an extensive procedure to safeguard the rights of innocent third party owners or rights holders.s 35(2)-(4). A court which convicts or acquits an accused shall declare any article which is forged or counterfeit, or which cannot lawfully be possessed by any person, to be forfeited to the State.s 35(2). Any weapon, instrument, vehicle, container or other article declared forfeited under section 35(1) shall be kept for thirty days from the date of forfeiture, or until a final decision, in terms of a section 35(4)(a) application, is made.s 35(3). According to s35(4)(a), the court in question may, at any time within three years from the date of forfeiture, upon application by any person other than the accused, who claims a vested right, inquire into and determine any such right. If the court finds that the article in question * is the property of the person making the application, it shall set aside the declaration of forfeiture and return the article to such person, or, if the State has disposed of the article, direct that such person be compensated by the State;s 35(4)(a)(i). or * was sold to the accused in pursuance of a contract under which he becomes the owner or the article, upon payment of the stipulated price, the court shall direct that the article be sold by public auction, and that the seller be paid out of the proceeds of the sale an amount equal to the value of his rights under the contract, but not exceeding the proceeds of the sale;s 35(4)(a)(ii)(aa). If the State has disposed of the article, the court shall direct that the said seller be likewise compensated.s 35(4)(a)(ii)(aa). The magistrate within whose area of jurisdiction the article was seized may, on application (and if satisfied that such offence is punishable in such country by death or by imprisonment for a period of twelve months or more, or by a fine of R500 or more), order such article to be delivered to a member of a police force established in such country.s 36. = Constitutionality = In terms of section 14 of the Constitution, \\"Everyone has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have * \\"their person or home searched; * \\"their property searched; * \\"their possessions seized; or * \\"the privacy of their communications infringed.\\" There have been no cases yet in the Constitutional Court deciding the constitutionality of Chapter 2 of the CPA. There are cases, however, which deal with similar provisions in other legislation, and which indicate that, should a constitutional challenge to Chapter 2 arise, the court will probably find its provisions to be constitutional. In Mistry v Interim National Medical and Dental Council of South Africa, the Constitutional Court struck down a provision in other legislation giving sweeping powers to inspectors to search and seize without warrant. In the course of the judgment, Sachs J seems to state obiter that Chapter 2 of the CPA appears to be in line with constitutional requirements.Para 25. See also Magajane v Chairperson, North West Gambling Board. In Investigating Directorate: Serious Economic Offences and Others v Hyundai, the Constitutional Court found provisions broadly similar to Chapter 2 to be constitutional.National Prosecuting Authority Act s 29(5). It seems, therefore, that Chapter 2 of the CPA will pass constitutional muster. A careful reading of Chapter 2 shows throughout a balancing of the interests of the individual and of society. On the question of the admissibility of evidence obtained in violation of rights, see the entry on the law of evidence in South Africa.See also Constitution s 35(5). There is no constitutional need for the State to give notice of its intention to apply for a search warrant. Although Thint v NDPP deals with warrants under section 29 of the National Prosecuting Authority Act,Act 32 of 1998. the same would apply to warrants under the CPA. If the police go beyond the terms of a search warrant and seize additional material not covered by the warrant, that is no basis for declaring the entire search unconstitutional.See Minister of Safety & Security v Bennett.  Legal representation  There is a basic right to legal representation.See generally S v Owies. In terms of sections 35(2)(b) and 35(3)(f) of the Constitution, the accused may choose his own lawyer, and is entitled to a lawyer, no matter how trivial the case against him. Sections 35(2)(c) and 35(3)(g) show the tension between the ideal of having every accused person represented, and the practical affordability of this ideal. Furthermore, section 73 of the CPA states that an accused is entitled to assistance after arrest and at criminal proceedings. If the accused cannot afford a lawyer, he is entitled to have a lawyer assigned by State at the State's expense, but only if substantial injustice would otherwise result.s 35(2)(c).35(3)(g). See Hlantlalala & Others v Dyanti NO & Another. See also Ehrlich v CEO, Legal Aid Board. There is no exact meaning to the term \\"substantial injustice.\\" It depends on the circumstances of each case. The likelihood of imprisonment without the option of a fine, for example, would probably be considered substantial injustice. Note that the State not obliged to provide the lawyer of the accused's choice. See S v Vermaas; S v Du Plessis.Para 15. In S v Halgryn, the court held that, if legal representation is assigned by State, the accused has little choice in the matter and cannot demand that the State assign to him counsel of his choice. S v Dangatye is an exception to the general rule that an accused may not demand that the State assign to him counsel of his choice. The accused in casu did not want a specific lawyer, as the lawyer did not speak his language. The court held, seeking to be sensitive to the multilingual nature of South Africa, made a sort of exception for Dangatye. In S v Cordier, the court held that, where an accused has indicated that he desires legal aid, and is not given an opportunity, before the commencement of the trial, to deal with the outcome of his application, after having been advised of the outcome thereof, and to consider his position before pleading to the relevant charge, the trial will be unfair. The court noted that, when a layman applies for legal aid, and thereafter appears without being informed of the outcome of her or his application, he could easily come to the conclusion that the application has been refused. A fair trial requires that, where an accused has applied for legal aid, the situation is resolved before the accused is permitted or, in appropriate circumstances, compelled to plead. In addition, a fair trial requires that any application for legal aid is carefully and completely noted in such a way that another court which is later burdened with the matter is properly apprised of that fact. In addition to the rights just mentioned, the accused has the right to be informed of these rights.See abovementioned sections. Failure to inform, however, is not per se fatal to the State's case.Constitution s 35(5). It depends on the circumstances of each case. If the accused is a senior attorney, for example, he cannot claim that he did not know of this right. See S v Morrison. If an accused declines to exercise his right to legal representation, the court should question the accused to ensure that the accused is aware of and the consequences of not exercising this right, and to clear up any misunderstandings. This is so that it may be certain that the accused is making an informed decision. See S v Sikhipha and S v Nkondo. See also S v Ndlovu; S v Sibisi. There are several components, then, to this constitutional right: * the right to legal representation; * the right to be informed of the right to legal representation; * the right to legal representation at State expense in certain circumstances; and * the right to be informed of the right to legal representation at State expense in certain circumstances. Although the right to choose one's legal representation is a fundamental right, to be zealously protected by the courts, it is not an absolute right; it is subject to reasonable limitations. The accused is not entitled to indefinite postponements merely because his first-choice legal representative is not available for a long time, or so that he can earn enough money to afford the lawyer of his choice. See S v Swanepoel.See S v Halgryn. The right to legal representation is important not only for the trial itself, but also for pre-trial evidence-gathering. See S v Melani. The right to legal representation also means representation of a certain standard. See S v Chabedi. S v In S v Halgryn, the court noted that passing judgment on the standard of legal representation given to the accused is problematic as it involves making a decision on the merit and capabilities of the lawyer. See S v Mvelase. See S v Tandwa.Paras 14‚Äì29. In S v Halgryn, the court held that, although the right to choose a legal representative is a fundamental right and one to be zealously protected by the courts, it is not an absolute right and is subject to reasonable limitations. It presupposes that the accused can make the financial arrangements for engaging the services of the chosen lawyer, and that the lawyer is readily available to perform the mandate. An accused may not, through the choice of any particular counsel, ignore all other considerations and the convenience of counsel is not overriding. If a legal representative is assigned by the State, the accused has little choice. The accused may not demand that the State assign to her or him counsel of her or his choice, but the accused may object to a particular representative on limited grounds, like conflict of interest or incompetence. Whether a defence is so incompetent that it makes the trial unfair is a factual question that does not depend upon the degree of ex post facto dissatisfaction of the litigant; the assessment must be objective. The failure to take certain basic steps, such as failing to consult, stands on a different footing from the failure to cross-examine effectively or the decision to call or not to call a particular witness. It is relatively easy to determine whether the right to counsel was rendered nugatory in the former type of case, but, in the latter instance, where counsel's discretion is involved, the scope for complaint is limited.  Disclosure by prosecution  On the pre-constitutional position, see R v Steyn, where the police docket was privileged from disclosure. South Africa's approach to disclosure by the prosecution is now widely acknowledge to have been flawed prior to the advent of the Constitution. Assistance, therefore, was derived from Canada. The position in Canada is adumbrated in R v Stinchcombe, which became a very influential precedent in South African cases decided shortly after the commencement of the Interim Constitution. It was held in Stinchombe that the fruits of the police investigation are not the property only of the prosecution; the defence is entitled to pre-trial disclosure. For the development of this area immediately after the advent of constitutional democracy in South Africa, see Phato v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape; Commissioner of the South African Police Services v Attorney- General, Eastern Cape. According to section 32(1) of the Constitution, everyone has the right to access to any information held by the State and any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights. Section 32(2) states that national legislation must be enacted to give effect to this right. According to subsections 35(3)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be informed of the charge with sufficient detail to answer it, and to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence. The Promotion of Access to Information Act is the national legislation that was enacted to give effect to the right to access to information. Of particular importance is section 39 of the Act, which places major limitations on the disclosure of police dockets. The reason for this limitation is that the mechanisms provided for in section 39 are very complicated and application of this Act to police dockets would overwhelm the system. We are left, therefore, with only the rights in terms of section 35(3) of the Constitution when it comes to police dockets. The position of an undefended accused is set out in S v Shiburi. It would be considered to be irregular for an undefended accused not to be afforded access to the police docket. In light of the case of Shabalala & Others v Attorney-General of Transvaal, it is important to consider at what stage of the proceedings the disclosure is sought. That the State has decided to charge accused, and has already disclosed the docket, does not prevent the State from investigating the case further. See Du Toit v DPP. The accused is not ordinarily entitled to disclosure of the docket for the purpose of a bail application.CPA s 60(14). The State may choose to disclose the docket for the purpose of a bail hearing, if it so desires, but there is no obligation to do so. This is because the purpose of a bail application is not to pass judgment of the guilt or innocence of the accused, but to consider the risk in releasing the accused. Thus it is considered to be a reasonable limitation on the right to access to the police docket. See S v Dlamini.Paras 81‚Äì85. It is also important to know what information may be withheld, and the procedure when the State seeks to withhold information. In general, see S v Crossberg and S v Rowand. As to the question of whether or not the accused is entitled to interview State witnesses, see Shabajaja.  Indictments in the High Court  An indictment has two functions: # It is the document on which a High Court trial is based (therefore it is the equivalent of the charge sheet in the lower court). # It is the way in which an accused is transferred from a lower court to a High Court for trial. As with charge sheets in the lower courts, s144(2) of the CPA states that the indictment must contain * the charge against the accused; * name of the accused; * address of the accused; and * description of the accused with regard to sex, nationality and age. In addition to this, s144(3) of the CPA states that the indictment must be accompanied by a summary of substantial facts (this is not needed in the lower courts). Before 1977, High Court trials were preceded by a preparatory examination in which evidence which tended to show the guilt of the accused was led, then the case was referred to the DPP to decide whether or not to prosecute the accused based on the findings in the preparatory examination. This was a time-consuming and expensive exercise as all the evidence thus had to be brought before the court twice: once for the preparatory examination and again for the trial. After the promulgation of the CPA, still in force today, the procedure is the same for the High Court as for the lower court: It is a summary trial. To bridge the gap created, the CPA requires a summary of substantial facts to accompany indictments. The summary of substantial facts must be present unless the accused pleads guilty at a preliminary appearance at a lower court and the case is therefore merely sent for sentencing. The summary of substantial facts should contain adequate information so as to inform the accused of the allegations. Whether the summary is adequate depends on the nature of the case. See S v Mpetha. When there is a variance or discrepancy between the summary and the evidence presented, s 144(3)(b) provides that the court can grant the accused a suitable adjournment. It must be noted that the summary is not strictly an integral part of the indictment, but merely an accompaniment; thus the State is not bound by what is in the summary. The State is not held to the summary, therefore, in the same way it would be held to the charge. This discrepancy may still be important, however. for the accused to cross- examine on. See S v Van Vuuren. As the State is not bound by the summary, it is not required to seek an amendment of a defective or erroneous summary. See S v Mlonyeni. The list of witnesses which is in the indictment is a list of potential witnesses; therefore it may be a long list and not necessarily every witness mentioned will be called. Section 144(3)(a)(ii) of the CPA permits the State to withhold the names and addresses of certain witnesses if there is a danger of tampering or intimidation, or if it is necessary for state security. If this is done, the practice is to mention in the list of witnesses that one or more names have been withheld. = Methods of transfer to High Court for trial = There are two main methods of transfer (each requiring an indictment), i.e.: # transfer in terms of s75(2) of the CPA where there is no preliminary plea in the Magistrates Court (this is the more common method); and # transfer in terms of Chapter 19 (sections 119-122) of the CPA where the accused was requested to make a preliminary plea under s119.  s 75(2)  This is the method used to transfer the accused from a lower court which does not have the jurisdiction to try the case * because that court has no territorial jurisdiction; or * because the charge is such that it cannot be tried in that court. This is a common way to transfer cases to the High Court on murder and rape charges.See also s 75(1)(c). It is also the method used to transfer a case from the Magistrate‚Äôs Court to a Regional Court where the magistrate does have territorial and offence-type jurisdiction, but the State feels that it is likely that the sentence will exceed the magistrate‚Äôs sentence jurisdiction.  Chapter 19 of the CPA (sections 119‚Äì122)  Section 119 concerns the appearance of the accused in a magistrate's court on a charge requiring trial in High Court. Sometimes the prosecutor uses Chapter 19 to secure a preliminary plea from the accused in the Magistrate‚Äôs Court. The prosecutor may put the charge to the accused, even if such charge is not triable in the magistrate's court. The prosecutor must have written authority from the DPP to take this step. The State not obliged to go this route to get case to the High Court for trial. It may rely instead on section 75. Section 120 concerns the lodging of the charge sheet and the recording of proceedings. The pleadings must be recorded. Section 121 concerns a plea of guilty by the accused, in which case the magistrate proceeds with questioning, as with section 112. If the magistrate is satisfied that it is a genuine plea of guilty, he adjourns the case for a decision of the DPP, who may * arraign for sentence before the High Court or another court having jurisdiction (for example, the regional court on a murder charge); * arraign for summary trial on any charge or charges before a court having jurisdiction; or * institute a preparatory examination.See s 123.This means that the preparatory examination may still take place but it is so rare that it is insignificant for our purposes. Section 122 deals with a plea of not guilty by the accused, in which case the magistrate proceeds as with a plea of not guilty in a summary trial as stated in section 115. Thereafter magistrate adjourns proceedings for a decision of the DPP, who may * arraign for summary trial on any charge or charges before a court having jurisdiction; or * institute a preparatory examination.See s 123. Section 106 says that an accused is entitled to a verdict at trial, but a plea under s119 does not entitle an accused to a verdict under s106(4). The rationale for this is that this plea is not meant to mark the commencement of the trial; it is merely an indication of the accused‚Äôs attitude towards the charge. Furthermore, if a verdict was required, the magistrate would, in effect, be able to convict an accused of a crime that may be out of the court‚Äôs jurisdiction. See S v Hendrix.  Rule against duplication of convictions  The rule against duplication of convictions is sometimes wrongly called the rule against splitting of charges. In terms of section 83, where there is uncertainty as to what charges the facts will prove, the accused may be charged with all or any of the possibilities at once. Charges may also be framed in the alternative. However, if the prosecutor chooses to allege the charges in the alternative, a conviction cannot be obtained on both the charges. As it is in the alternative, it is one or the other. Objection may not be taken to the so-called \\"splitting of charges;\\" only to a duplication of convictions.S v Grobler. Where an act or omission constitutes an offence under two or more statutory provisions or is an offence against a statutory provision and the common law, the person guilty of such act or omission shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either the statutory provision or, as the case may be, under the statutory provision or the common law, but shall not be liable to more than one punishment for the act or omission constituting the offence.CPA s 336. There are two traditional tests: # the single-intention test; and # the evidence test, which asks whether the evidence which establishes the one offence at the same time also establishes the other. See S v Grobler, S v Prins and S v Benjamin. For example, does the evidence establishing the commission of a robbery also establish the commission of theft and assault? In terms of the single-intention test, if a person committed several acts, each of which could be an offence on its own, but which constituted a continuous transaction carried out with a single intent, his or her conduct would constitute only a single offence. The problem with these tests is that they are theoretically helpful but are difficult to apply. S v Benjamin appeared to reverse previous authority until the case of S v Moloto, where the SCA overturned the principle in Benjamin. Therefore it is possible to have a conviction on charges of both attempted murder and robbery: The court in Moloto did not say that the finding in Benjamin was wrong, but stated that the circumstances in Benjamin were highly exceptional. The bottom line is that convictions on both attempted murder and robbery are possible. When considering whether or not there was an improper duplication of charges, the definition of the offences in question is a logical starting point.S v Moloto. See S v Longdistance (Natal). Note that neither test is infallible; common sense must prevail. See R v Khan. See S v Pakane, where convictions of an accessory after the fact of murder and of defeating the ends of justice amounted to an improper duplication of convictions. The problem used to be that because of the nature of negligence, the courts were uncertain if it was proper to have multiple counts of culpable homicide for the same action. In the past, it used to be that because there was no intention and only one act, there was only one charge, as in S v Mampa. The SCA has now held, however, that there can be multiple convictions for culpable homicide arising out of the same act. See S v Naidoo. For an example of the application of the principle, see S v Whitehead, where the court ruled in the circumstances of the case that convictions of culpable homicide and public violence would constitute improper duplication.For other examples, see Du Toit.  Further particulars to charge  An accused may request the prosecution to supply particulars or further particulars of any matter alleged in the charge. Further particulars may only be requested before the commencement of evidence.s 87(1). It can be after the plea, in other words, so long as no evidence has been led yet. The reason for this is that before 1977, the procedure was carried out in such a way that the accused had to plead as early as possible. If particulars are only requested after the plea, the accused has no right to have the charge quashed if he is dissatisfied with the particulars. The request is to be in writing. If the State refuses to supply the particulars or if the accused is not satisfied with the particulars delivered, the court may order the delivery of particulars. The court may also adjourn to give the State time to deliver particulars. The accused is not entitled to request further particulars when pleading under section 119 or 122A. This is because the trial has not commenced yet. The accused is not entitled to particulars as to which documents the State intends using as exhibits during trial: This is not an issue for particulars. It is regarded as evidence, not part of the charge itself. See Du Toit v DPP. On delivery, the particulars form part of the record. The trial proceeds as if charge has been amended in accordance with the particulars.s 87(2). The State is then bound by the particulars as it is bound by the charge. = General principles = Although section 84(2) of the CPA states that it is sufficient to describe a statutory charge in the words of the statute, this cannot be used as justification for a charge that would otherwise be objectionable. Thus the State can‚Äôt refuse to say more if the accused requires further particulars. The accused is entitled to as much information about the offence as is necessary for a thorough preparation of his defence. See S v Cooper. The purpose of particulars is not to confuse the defence, so the so-called \\"scatter-gun\\" approach is unacceptable. See S v Sadeke. See also R v Verity- Amm. The test for whether or not further particulars should be granted is whether there is reasonable need of accused for such particulars,S v Cooper. but each case is to be decided on its own facts. See R v Adams. If the particulars are denied by trial court, this could lead to a setting aside of a conviction on appeal on grounds of irregularity. See R v Verity-Amm. In assessing the adequacy of particulars, the trial court may have regard to a summary of the substantial facts. If the trial is in the High Court, there must be summary of the substantial facts accompanying the indictment.See s 144(3)(a). The skimpier the summary of substantial facts, the greater the need for particularity in the charge. See S v Mpetha.S v Levenstein.See also s 87(3). The State cannot be expected to furnish particulars it does not have. See S v Alexander. Thus where any of the particulars are unknown to the prosecutor it shall be sufficient to state that fact in the charge.s 84(2). Generally, the State is not obliged to furnish in particulars the evidence whereby the charge will be proved. Circumstances may occur, however, where such evidence will have to be disclosed. See S v Cooper. When the State relies on common purpose between the accused and others, the State is obliged, if requested, to disclose the facts on which it will rely to draw inference of common purpose.S v Mpetha. If a lower court refuses to order particulars, the accused can approach the High Court for a mandamus. See Behrman v Regional Magistrate, Southern Transvaal. It is worth noting, however, the general reluctance of higher courts to get involved in uncompleted proceedings. The test is prejudice to the accused. If for technical reasons, in the High Court trial, the court refuses to order particulars, there can be no approach to the Supreme Court of Appeal to compel the High Court to order particulars. See S v Suliman. The only remedy would be appeal or special entry after the conclusion of the trial. See, however, S v Western Areas Ltd, which seems to indicate that if there are very good grounds for approaching the SCA, it may be considered.  Pleas of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit  When one enters a plea of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit, one is contending that one has previously been convicted or acquitted on the same charges. The principle is that one should not be tried twice for the same offence. In other legal systems, the expression \\"double jeopardy\\" is sometimes used. One ought to look carefully at the wording of the relevant subsections, in particular at section 35(3)(m) of the Constitution, with its slight difference in wording compared with section 106. There is a threefold test for autrefois acquit: # Was the acquittal for the same offence? # Was it by a court of competent jurisdiction? # Was it on the merits? For autrefois convict, the first two legs apply. The third is inapplicable because a conviction would necessarily be on the merits. = Same offence = In subsections 106(1)(c) and (d), an extended meaning is given to the words \\"substantially identical.\\"S v Ndou.S v Mcintyre en andere. The principle is not limited to offences for which the accused could have been convicted at a previous trial: that is, it is not limited to competent verdicts listed in Chapter 26 of CPA.Ndou. Examples of the application of the principle may be located in S v Nkosi, S v Nyathi and R v Constance. Some assistance here may also be gained from the principles relating to the duplication of convictions. Note the apparent exception in cases such as death ensuing after the completion of a trial on a charge of assault.S v Gabriel. = Court of competent jurisdiction = In this regard, see R v Ntoyaba and S v Pokela (which includes a foreign court). = On the merits = For an adumbration of the meaning of \\"on the merits,\\" see S v Moodie, S v Naidoo, S v Mthetwa, DPP, KZN v Regional Magistrate, Vryheid and sections 322, 324 and 313. Proper notice of the plea must be given.CPA s 106(3). Note that, in England, there is now a new provision allowing for a retrial in spite of acquittal in certain classes of cases.UK Criminal Justice Act 2003 Ch 44, ss 75‚Äì81.See R v Dunlop for the first application of this radical alteration of the law.  Plea and sentence agreements  The situation prior to the commencement of section 105A of the CPA is illustrated in S v Blank, North Western Dense Concrete CC v Director of Public Prosecutions, Western Cape and Van Eeden v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cape). The basic problem was that the accused was not sure whether the court would go along with the State's attitude as to sentence. This issue was comprehensively addressed by section 105A of CPA, which introduced detailed procedures for plea and sentence agreements. The procedures may be divided into five stages: # preliminaries; # court checks on formalities; # plea questioning; # court checks sentence agreement, and thereafter convicts and sentences if everyone is satisfied; and # trial de novo, if not all parties are satisfied. = Preliminaries = Section 105A(1)(a) requires the written authority of the NDPP and agreement in respect of a plea of guilty and just sentence. In terms of section 105A(1)(b), the prosecutor must consult with investigating officer, but see section 105A(1)(c). The complainant must be afforded the opportunity to make representations. Section 105A(2) provides what must be in agreement. The court may not participate in the negotiations.s 105A(3). = Court checks on formalities = Next the prosecutor informs the court of the agreement.s 105A(4). The court asks the accused to confirm that the agreement has been entered into. The court must satisfy itself on certain procedural requirements, as to consultation with the investigating officer and the opportunity of the complainant to make representations. The prosecutor and the accused will have an opportunity to correct any defects if the court is not satisfied. Upon being satisfied, the court requires the accused to plead, and orders that the contents of the agreement be disclosed in court. = Plea questioning = In terms of section 105A(6)(a), the court questions the accused to ascertain * that he confirms the terms of the agreement and admissions; * that he admits the allegations in the charge to which there is a plea of guilty; and * that this is freely and voluntarily done. In terms of section 105A(6)(b), if the court is not satisfied that the accused is guilty, or if the accused does not admit any allegation in the charge, or has incorrectly admitted such, or if the court is satisfied, for any other reason, that the plea should not stand, then court will record a plea of not guilty and order the trial to start de novo before another presiding officer (unless the accused waives such right to another presiding officer). If the court is satisfied with the plea, then the matter proceeds to the fourth stage listed above.s 105A(7). The court does not at this stage enter a conviction. = Court checks sentence agreement = The court now proceeds to consider the sentence agreement.s 105A(7)(a). It exercises its usual powers in regard to sentence information.s 105A(7)(b). In terms of section 105A(8), if the court is satisfied that the sentence agreement is just, it informs the prosecutor and the accused accordingly, and then convicts and sentences as per the agreement. As to the meaning of \\"just sentence,\\" it is not required that the court find that it is the exact sentence that it would have imposed.S v Sassin.S v Esterhuizen.Du Toit et al 15‚Äì19. In terms of section 105A(9), if the court is not satisfied that the agreement is just, it informs the prosecutor and the accused of what it considers a just sentence. The prosecutor and the accused may then abide by the agreement on the charge (for example, if there has been a plea to a lesser charge), whereupon the court convicts and proceeds to the sentence stage. The prosecutor and the accused at this point have the right to address the court and adduce evidence on sentence. Alternatively, in terms of section 105A(9)(b), the prosecutor and the accused may withdraw from the agreement. In terms of section 105A(9)(d), in the event of withdrawal, there must be a trial de novo before a different presiding officer (but the accused may waive his right to a different presiding officer). The provisions of section 105A must be complied with strictly.S v Solomons. The court may not simply impose the sentence it thinks fit. = Procedure if agreement set aside = In terms of section 105A(10), in the event of a trial de novo after withdrawal, the agreement is null and void, and no regard is to be had to negotiations, agreement, etc., unless the accused consents to the recording of such as admissions. There may be no further plea or sentence agreement on the charge arising from the same facts. The prosecution may proceed on any charge. In terms of section 105A(11), the NDPP is to issue directives. An example of the new provisions in practice is to be found in S v Sassin & Others.[2003] 4 All SA 506 (NC).In general, see the article by Esther Steyn in SACJ. Section 105A does not appear to prevent the informal type of agreement as in North Western Dense Concrete.See also S v Yengeni.  Inquests  Inquests in South Africa are governed by the Inquests Act.Act 58 of 1959. = Nature = As the court put it in Marais v Tiley, \\"An inquest is an official investigation into a death occurring otherwise than from natural causes, which has not been the subject of a criminal prosecution.\\" = Purpose = The court added, in Marais v Tiley, that \\"the underlying purpose of an inquest is to promote public confidence and satisfaction; to reassure the public that all deaths from unnatural causes will receive proper attention and investigation so that, where necessary, appropriate measures can be taken to prevent similar occurrences, and so that persons responsible for such deaths may, as far as possible, be brought to justice.\\"See also Timol v Magistrate, Johannesburg. = Commencement = Section 2 of the Inquests Act provides that anyone who becomes aware of an unnatural death (that is, a death by other than natural causes) has a duty to report such to a member of the police, unless he has reason to think that it has already been done. Section 3 provides that the police official who receives such information has a duty to investigate. If the body is available, it must be examined by a doctor, usually at a post-mortem examination. Section 4 provides that, on conclusion of the examination, the police official submits statements and information, together with the report, to the prosecutor. The prosecutor may call for additional information. If the prosecutor decides to prosecute in connection with the death, the inquest process stops there. In terms of section 5, however, if no prosecution is to be instituted, the prosecutor submits the statements to magistrate of the district.s 5(1). If it appears to the magistrate, on the materials submitted, that a death took place, and that it was not due to natural causes, the magistrate causes an inquest to be instituted.s 5(2). If the inquest is to be held in another district, or before a judge or regional magistrate, the magistrate forwards the papers accordingly.s 5(3). The death of a stillborn child is not the death of a \\"person\\" for the purposes of the Act.Van Heerden v Joubert. If, at any time after inquest has been decided on, it comes to the notice of the judicial officer that criminal proceedings are being instituted in connection with the death, he must stop the proceedings.s 17(2). Where there has been a death at sea, and no body has been brought ashore, the court does not have jurisdiction to hold an inquest.In re Ohlson. In terms of section 6, the inquest is to be held in the district where the incident causing death took place. The Minister of Justice may order that the inquest be held before a judge or regional magistrate in certain circumstances. In terms of section 8, the judicial officer causes witnesses to be subpoenaed for the inquest. He may have regard to the request of any person who has a substantial and peculiar interest in the inquest. Laws governing criminal trials are applied, with necessary changes, to the summoning of witnesses and the giving of evidence.See Magmoed v Janse van Rensburg. Section 203 of the CPA applies, with its privilege against giving self-incriminating answers. Section 10 provides that the inquest is to be held in public, unless the judicial officer decides that there are good reasons to the contrary. In terms of section 11, the prosecutor examines (or questions) the witnesses. Other persons with an interest may, with the permission of the judicial officer, also examine. Section 13 provides that the judicial officer may allow affidavits instead of oral testimony. In terms of section 16(2), after evidence is concluded, the judicial officer makes findings as to * the identity of deceased; * the cause or likely cause of death; * the date of death; and * whether the death was brought about by an act or an omission involving an offence by any person. If the judicial officer unable to make any such finding, he records accordingly.s 16(3). The onus for findings is a balance of probabilities.In re Goniwe.Padi v Botha. In case of a death, where the body is destroyed or not found, and if the judicial officer makes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that a death occurred, special provisions apply.s 16(1). The judicial officer then makes findings as required by section 16(2), and if the judicial officer is not a judge he sends the findings to the High Court on review.s 18. If confirmed on review, such amounts to a finding of presumed death. If the judicial officer at the inquest was a judge, such finding amounts to a finding of presumed death.See Geregtelike Doodsondersoek Adam Mkhabela for an example of the application of this.See also In re Ohlson. Section 17 provides that, after findings have been made, the judicial officer must in the following circumstances refer the record to the DPP: * where he is unable to make any finding under section 16(2); * where judicial officer makes a finding that someone is prima facie responsible for bringing about the death; and * where the DPP requests the judicial officer to forward the record. The DPP may then request the judicial officer to reopen the inquest to hear further evidence, whereupon the judicial officer is obliged to reopen it. On conclusion of such further evidence, the judicial officer again makes section 16 findings and sends the record back to the DPP. Section 17A makes special provisions for the Minister to order the judge to reopen and take over a concluded inquest. This legislation introduced for the purpose of the inquest in In re Goniwe.  Asset Forfeiture  This section deals with asset forfeiture under the provisions of POCA only. There are, of course, other asset-forfeiture provisions, such as under section 34 and 35 of the CPA and section 20 of the Counterfeit Goods Act.Act 37 of 1997. POCA is a wide-ranging measure aimed at cracking down on organised crime. It creates offences related to racketeering activities, money laundering, assisting another to benefit from proceeds of organised crime, failure to report suspicious activities, and gang-related activities. It also has wide- ranging provisions for forfeiture of assets. The relevant parts of POCA are Chapters 5 and 6. There are definitions in section 1 for the entire Act, as well as in section 12 for the purposes of Chapter 5. The purpose of these provisions is to crack down on organised crime by making it unprofitable. The Preamble to Act refers to the rapid growth of organised crime, its threat to the economic stability of country, the inadequacy of the common law to deal with the problem and the failure to keep pace with international measures. NDPP v Mohamed gives an excellent summary of the purpose and methodology of Chapters 5 and 6.Paras 14‚Äì22. Chapters 5 and 6 are both aimed at preventing profit from crime. There is an important difference between the two chapters: Chapter 5 is conviction-based; Chapter 6 is not. = Proceeds of unlawful activities (Chapter 5) = The term \\"defendant\\" is used here instead of \\"accused.\\"See s 12(1). Although these proceedings are \\"conviction-based,\\" they are treated as civil proceedings.s 13.  Confiscation orders  In terms of section 18, when a defendant is convicted of an offence the court may, on application of the prosecutor, enquire into any benefit which defendant may have derived from * that offence; * any other offence of which defendant is convicted at the same trial; and * any criminal activity which the court finds to be \\"sufficiently related\\" to those offences. If the court finds that defendant has so benefitted, it may make an order for payment to State of any amount it considers appropriate, up to the maximum value of * the defendant's proceeds of the criminal activity;s 18(2)(a).s 19 sets out how the value of the defendant's proceeds are calculated: in essence the payments or other rewards received. and * the amount which might be realised under section 20.s 18(2)(b). s 20 provides that the amount which might be realised shall be equal to the sum of all realisable property and all affected gifts made by the defendant, less the sum of all obligations having priority. (\\"Affected gifts\\" are defined in s 12, read with s 16. They include gifts made by the defendant less than seven years previously, and gifts made more than seven years previously if it was property received by the defendant in connection with offences committed by him or any other person. s 16 includes as a gift any property transferred for value substantially below its true value. The difference between transfer value and true value is regarded as the gift value for the purposes of. Sections 21 and 22 provide for special ways of proving what the proceeds of the unlawful activities were. Confiscation orders have the effect of civil judgments.s 23. If the defendant absconds or dies before the confiscation order has been made, the court can still in certain circumstances make a confiscation order.s 24.  Restraint orders  These are orders issued in anticipation of a confiscation order to keep safe from disposal the property, etc., to be sought in a confiscation order. Such orders may be made * when a prosecution has been instituted against a defendant; * when a confiscation order has been made, or there are reasonable grounds for believing that such order may be made, against such defendant; or * when the court is satisfied that a person is to be charged with an offence and there are reasonable grounds for believing that confiscation order may be made.s 25. The NDPP can apply ex parte to High Court for an order prohibiting any person from dealing in any manner with any property which is subject to the order.s 26. Conditions and exceptions may be stipulated in the order. Such an order may relate to * realisable property specified in the order; * all realisable property held by such person; and * all property which, if transferred to such person after the making of the restraint order, would be realisable property. Court to which the application made may issue a provisional restraint order having immediate effect and simultaneously grant a rule nisi calling on the defendant to show cause why the provisional order should not be made final. The object of such orders is not to enrich the State, but to deprive the convicted person of ill- gotten gains.NDPP v Rebuzzi. The court must have reasonable grounds for granting such an order; a mere summary of allegations by the NDPP insufficient.NDPP v Basson. A mere assertion by the NDPP is not enough, but it is not necessary to prove that a final order will definitely be made.NDPP v Kyriacou. In terms of section 26(7), the court making the restraint order may also make an order to compel the defendant to disclose the whereabouts, etc., of the property over which he may have effective control. This power should not be lightly exercised, as it tends to infringe on the right not to incriminate oneself.NDPP v Rebuzzi. Note that a restraint order is appealable.Phillips v NDPP (SCA case: 2003). The court granting the restraint order has no inherent jurisdiction to rescind that order.Phillips v NDPP (CC case: 2006). Sections 30 to 36 deal with the mechanics of the realisation of property after the confiscation order. For a full discussion of Chapter 5, see S v Shaik. = Civil recovery of property (Chapter 6) = Proceedings under this Chapter are civil.s 37. They are not conviction-based. They have been described as \\"complex and tightly intertwined, both as a matter of process and substance.\\"Mohamed (1) para 22.See also Prophet v NDPP (CC). The process begins with an application by the NDPP to the High Court for a preservation order.s 38. The application may be ex parte (s 38(1)), but that does not mean that the ordinary principles of audi alteram partem do not apply.NDPP v Mohamed (2). The court makes an order if there are reasonable grounds for believing the property is * an \\"instrumentality of an offence\\" referred to in Schedule 1;Schedule 1 includes a wide range of common-law and statutory offences, including any offence which may be punished by more than one year‚Äôs imprisonment without the option of a fine. or * the proceeds of unlawful activities. \\"Instrumentality of an offence\\" is defined in section 1 as any property which is concerned in the commission or suspected commission of an offence, whether within the Republic or elsewhere, at any time before or after the commencement of the Act.See NDPP v Mohunram.See also NDPP v Parker. \\"Proceeds of unlawful activities\\" is defined in section 1 as any property or part thereof or any service, advantage, benefit or reward which was derived, received or retained, directly or indirectly, in connection with or as a result of any unlawful activity carried on by any person, whether in the Republic or elsewhere, at any time before or after the commencement of the Act. \\"Unlawful activity\\" is defined as any conduct which constitutes a crime or which contravenes any law, whether such conduct occurred before or after the commencement of the Act, and whether such conduct occurred in the Republic or elsewhere. For the meaning of these two concepts, see NDPP v R O Cook Properties. This SCA case involved three separate cases. In two, the issue was whether buildings used for a brothel were an \\"instrumentality of an offence.\\" The SCA said no: The term had to be strictly interpreted. In the third case, the issue was whether or not money deposited into an account under a false name, done to hide it from the Receiver of Revenue, was \\"proceeds of crime.\\" SCA said no: This term also had to be strictly interpreted. Another important case is S v Prophet, where premises used for the manufacture of drugs were an \\"instrumentality of an offence.\\" In NPPP: in re appeal, money used for bribing police officer was found to be an \\"instrumentality of an offence.\\" When considering whether something is an \\"instrumentality of an offence,\\" the court should adopt a narrow interpretation. The mere use of a venue is not sufficient to render it an \\"instrumentality.\\"Singh v NDPP. There should also be proportionality between the nature of the offence and the value of the asset in question.Mohunram v NDPP.See also NDPP v Geyser. In NDPP v Braun, the court refused to grant an order where a house was used for sexual offences, on the grounds of a lack of proportionality. Section 38 has been described as \\"part of a complex, two-stage procedure.\\"Mohamed (1). The CC has ruled that this provision is not unconstitutional.Mohamed (2). Preservation orders under section 38 expire after ninety days, unless application for forfeiture order is lodged, or unless the order is rescinded before the expiration of the period.s 40. If the preservation order is in force, the NDPP may apply for forfeiture order of all property subject to the preservation order.s 48. The court will make such order if it finds on balance of probabilities that the property in question is * an instrumentality of a Schedule 1 offence; or * the proceeds of unlawful activities (as defined in section 1). The rights of persons who, on balance of probabilities, acquired such property legally and neither knew nor had reasonable grounds for believing that it was an instrumentality or was the proceeds of unlawful activities, are protected.s 52. = Criminal Assets Recovery Account = Chapter 47 provides for the establishment of a Criminal Assets Recovery Account. All proceeds of asset forfeiture go into this account.  Child Justice Act  The Child Justice ActAct 75 of 2008. (CJA) came into operation on 1 April 2010. It regulates comprehensively the entire spectrum of criminal procedure for children (people under eighteen years) from the pre-trial stage through to appeal. The CJA works parallel with the CPA. This can be confusing, as one needs to keep both Acts open whenever there is a child involved in the criminal justice system. There are as yet no decided cases on the provisions of CJA. The Preamble to the CJA sets out the aims of the Act. Its ideals are lofty. Only time will tell whether they can be attained via the mechanism of CJA. Sections 2 and 3 take this theme further. Noteworthy, too, is the extensive definition section.s 1. Of particular note are the following: * \\"'child justice court' means any court provided for in the Criminal Procedure Act, dealing with bail application, plea, trial or sentencing of a child.\\" * \\"'diversion' means diversion of a matter involving a child away from the formal court procedures in a criminal matter by means of the procedures established by Chapter 6 and Chapter 8.\\" * \\"'restorative justice' means an approach to justice that aims to involve the child offender, the victim, the families concerned and community members to collectively [sic] identify and address harms, needs and obligations through accepting responsibility, making restitution, taking measures to prevent a recurrence of the incident and promoting reconciliation.\\" * \\"'symbolic restitution' means the giving of an object owned, made or bought by a child or the provision of any service to a specified person, persons, group of persons or community, charity or welfare organisation or institution as symbolic compensation for the harm caused by that child.\\" = General provisions = Section 6 ranks the seriousness of possible offences a child can commit according to three groups: # Schedule 1 offences; # Schedule 2 offences; and # Schedule 3 offences. Note that these are schedules to CJA, not CPA. Section 6 specifies that the seriousness of the offences increases from Schedule 1 through to Schedule 3. Section 7 raises the minimum age of criminal capacity from seven to ten years. Between the ages of ten and fourteen, there is a presumption against criminal capacity, which the state may rebut by way of proof beyond reasonable doubt.See s 11. In the light of this alteration in the law, section 9 is strange: It talks about a child under the age of ten who commits a crime. This is a contradiction in terms, since section 7 provides that a child under that age cannot commit a crime. What it probably means to refer to is a child under the age of ten who committed an act that would have amounted to a crime but for the fact that the child was under the age of criminal capacity. Section 9 stipulates that, in such a case, the police may not arrest the child; they must take the child to its parents or, if they are unavailable, to some other appropriate adult. If none of the above are available or suitable, they must take it to a youth-care centre. The police must also then notify a probation officer. If a child is over ten, but under fourteen, a prosecutor considering whether to prosecute is required to consider a long list of criteria about capacity to commit a crime, whether a prosecution is in fact warranted, and whether some form of diversion would not be more appropriate instead of prosecution. Determining the age of the child is extensively provided for in Chapter 2, Part 3, of the CJA. = Securing presence of the child accused before preliminary inquiry = Chapter 7 of CJA provides for a preliminary inquiry as the first step whenever a child is to be brought before court. Section 17 provides for three methods of securing the presence of a child at a preliminary inquiry: # written notice under section 18; # summons under section 19; and # arrest under section 20. For each of these three methods, the equivalent method of securing attendance under the CPA is amended somewhat to cater for the fact that the accused is a child. In particular, section 20 provides that a child may not be arrested for a Schedule 1 offence (an offence that falls into the least serious category) unless there are compelling reasons. \\"Compelling reasons\\" include: * the child not having a fixed residential address; * the child being likely to continue committing offences; * the child being a danger to others; and * the offence being in the process of being committed when the arrest is affected. Whatever method of securing attendance is adopted, there is an obligation to inform a probation officer of the fact of notice, summons or arrest, as the case may be, as soon as possible, but within a maximum period of 24 hours. = Placement of child prior to sentence = Section 21 makes it clear that, whenever possible, a child who has been arrested should be released. Prior to first appearance in court, this can occur either by way of bail or written notice.s 21(2). At first appearance, the magistrate may release the child into the custody of its parents or another suitable adult, or on the child's own recognisance (that is, on warning) or on bail. If the child has been arrested on a Schedule 1 offence, section 22 requires a police official to release the child on bail prior to first appearance, unless the parents and guardian cannot be found despite diligent effort, or unless there is substantial risk that release would constitute a danger to someone else or the child itself. If the police official does not release a child who has been arrested on a Schedule 1 offence, the official must supply the magistrate with a report as to why the child was not released. Where a child who is in custody is appearing at a preliminary inquiry, and the inquiry is to be postponed to a later date, the presiding magistrate is obliged to consider releasing the child from custody under one or another mechanism.s 24. Sections 26 to 33 contain detailed provisions about where a child who is not to be released shall be detained. The underlying principle appears to be that, wherever possible, the child shall be detained at a special facility and not be exposed to adult detainees. = Assessment of child = Save for exceptional circumstances, all children who have been arrested, or otherwise given notification of appearance at a preliminary inquiry, must be assessed by a probation officer.s 34. Section 35 sets out what the assessment should encompass. It should * \\"establish whether a child may be in need of care and protection in order to refer the child to a children‚Äôs court in terms of section 50 or 64;\\" * \\"estimate the age of the child if the age is uncertain;\\" * \\"gather information relating to any previous conviction, previous diversion or pending charge in respect of the child;\\" * \\"formulate recommendations regarding the release or detention and placement of the child;\\" * \\"where appropriate, establish the prospects for diversion of the matter;\\" * \\"in the case of a child under the age of 10 years or a child referred to in section 10 (2) (b), establish what measures need to be taken in terms of section 9;\\" * \\"in the case of a child who is 10 years or older but under the age of 14 years, express a view on whether expert evidence referred to in section 11 (3) would be required;\\" * \\"determine whether the child has been used by an adult to commit the crime in question;\\" and * \\"provide any other relevant information regarding the child which the probation officer may regard to be in the best interests of the child or which may further any objective which this Act intends to achieve.\\" = Diversion by prosecutor for minor offences = Section 41 empowers a prosecutor to choose diversion instead of prosecution in the case of a Schedule 1 offence. Diversion, which features prominently in the Act, is some or other program that runs outside the formal criminal justice system.See the definition quoted above. If the prosecutor decides on diversion, the diversion must be made an order of court.s 42. = Preliminary inquiry = Section 43 sets out the nature and requirements of a preliminary inquiry. It is an informal pre-trial procedure, inquisitorial in nature, and may be held in a court or any other suitable place.s 43(1). Subsection 2 sets out the objectives of a preliminary inquiry, which are to \\"consider the assessment report of the probation officer, with particular reference to * \\"the age estimation of the child, if the age is uncertain;\\" * \\"the view of the probation officer regarding the criminal capacity of the child if the child is 10 years or older but under the age of 14 years and a decision whether an evaluation of the criminal capacity of the child by a suitably qualified person referred to in section 11 (3) is necessary;\\" and * \\"whether a further and more detailed assessment of the child is needed as referred to in section 40 (1) (g).\\" The preliminary inquiry must also * \\"establish whether the matter can be diverted before plea; * \\"identify a suitable diversion option, where applicable; * \\"establish whether the matter should be referred in terms of section 50 to a children‚Äôs court referred to in section 42 of the Children‚Äôs Act; * \\"ensure that all available information relevant to the child, his or her circumstances and the offence are considered to make a decision on diversion and placement of the child; * \\"ensure that the views of all persons present are considered before a decision is taken; * \\"encourage the participation of the child and his or her parent, an appropriate adult or a guardian in decisions concerning the child; and * \\"determine the release or placement of a child, pending ** \\"the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry; ** \\"the appearance of the child in a child justice court; or ** \\"the referral of the matter to a children's court, where applicable.\\" Subsection (3)(a) provides that a preliminary inquiry must be held in every case involving a child, unless the prosecutor has diverted the case, or the child is under ten, or the case has been withdrawn.Note, again, the illogicality: If a child is under ten, he has no criminal responsibility; hence there should not be any court case. Subsection (3)(b) requires a preliminary inquiry to take place within 48 hours of arrest, if there has been an arrest. The extensions of the 48-hour period that ordinarily apply under section 50 of the CPA apply here, too.See CJA s 20(5). If there has not been an arrest, the preliminary inquiry must take place within the time specified in the notice or summons, as the case may be. A preliminary inquiry is considered to be a first appearance as under section 50 of the CPA. Chapter 7 contains a number of other provisions relating to procedures at preliminary inquiries. = Diversion = Section 51 sets out the objects of diversion, which are to * \\"deal with a child outside the formal criminal justice system in appropriate cases; * \\"encourage the child to be accountable for the harm caused by him or her; * \\"meet the particular needs of the individual child; * \\"promote the reintegration of the child into his or her family and community; * \\"provide an opportunity to those affected by the harm to express their views on its impact on them; * \\"encourage the rendering to the victim of some symbolic benefit or the delivery of some object as compensation for the harm; * \\"promote reconciliation between the child and the person or community affected by the harm caused by the child; * \\"prevent stigmatising the child and prevent the adverse consequences flowing from being subject to the criminal justice system; * \\"reduce the potential for re-offending; * \\"prevent the child from having a criminal record; and * \\"promote the dignity and well- being of the child, and the development of his or her sense of self-worth and ability to contribute to society.\\" Section 52 provides that a case may be diverted if, after consideration of all the relevant material presented at a preliminary inquiry or trial, it appears * that the child acknowledges responsibility for the offence; * that there is a prima facie case; * that the child, together with its parent or a suitable adult, accepts diversion; and * that the prosecutor or DPP agrees to diversion. The prosecutor may agree to diversion if the case falls under Schedule 1 or 2, provided that, if the case falls under Schedule 2, the prosecutor must first consult the victim and the investigating officer. If the case falls under Schedule 3, the DPP may in writing agree to diversion, if exceptional circumstances exist. Here, too, the DPP must consult the victim and the investigating officer. Once the prosecutor or DPP has agreed to diversion, the court makes an order that the case be diverted. Section 53 sets out numerous diversion options, including orders that the child attend school, avoid certain peers, good behaviour, etc. Section 58 provides that, if the magistrate receives information that the child is not complying with a diversion order, a warrant for arrest may be issued. Once the child is brought before court, the magistrate inquires into the matter. If it appears that the failure to comply was not the child's fault, the court may allow the diversion to continue, with or without modification. If, however, it appears that the fault lay with the child, the magistrate may discontinue diversion and order a prosecution to proceed. Under section 59, if a child complies with a diversion order, there may thereafter be no prosecution for the offence in question. Section 60 provides for a proper register to be kept of all diversions, so that track can be kept. = Trial of child in Child Justice Court = If a child is to be tried together with an adult, the ordinary provisions of the CPA apply to the adult, and the special provisions of the CJA to the child. A child must be assisted by a parent or suitable adult. The trial is to take place without delay. There are time limits to the length of postponement where a child is in custody. = Sentencing = Section 69 sets out a complex list of considerations to be borne in mind when sentencing a child. Section 71 provides that a pre- sentencing report must be obtained before a child is sentenced. Sections 72 to 78 set out various sentencing options. These include the usual range of sentences found in the CPA, but with additional controls. In addition, there is provision for community-based sentences and restorative-justice sentences. Section 77 deals with imprisonment. Imprisonment may not be imposed on a child under fourteen. If a child is fourteen or older, imprisonment may only be imposed as a last resort. Additionally, if the offence is a Schedule 1 or 2 offence, there are further restrictions. = Legal representation = There are several provisions governing legal representation. The most striking provision is to be found in section 83, which states that, if a child refuses legal representation, the court must nevertheless see that the Legal Aid Board appoints a representative to assist the court. = Appeal and automatic review = The new provisions relating to the requirement of leave to appeal for cases involving children are contained in section 84, and have already been referred to. In summary, there is an automatic right of appeal to a child under sixteen in all cases, and for a child over sixteen but under eighteen if direct imprisonment has been imposed. = Conclusion = This legislation is extremely complex. There are many parts of it that may prove difficult to achieve in practice, especially if many calls are made on the time and skill of probation officers.

Adam van D√ºren was a master builder and stonemason active in Denmark and Sweden at the end of the fifteenth century and the first decades of the sixteenth century (he is attested from about 1487 until about 1532). Adam appears to have been of Westphalian origin and probably came from the city of D√ºren, alluded to in the byname. He was first active at the building of the choir of Link√∂ping Cathedral (about 1487-1498), and has been identified as one of two masons whose style is clearly recognisable in the ornaments there. He was probably the architect of the fortified house of Glimmingehus. His signature ADAM and the year 1505 is included in a relief at the third floor of Glimmingehus showing the owner of the house, Jens Holgersen Ulfstand, and his two wives in front of the crucified Christ, but his style can be recognised in several other reliefs in the building. He later restored the crypt of Lund Cathedral, where he, among other things, installed drain pipes under the floor to prevent flooding. He was briefly active in Stockholm in 1520-21, where he built a chapel in the south-eastern part of the Church of St. Nicolas (Storkyrkan), where he also added an inscribed relief on a pillar, depicting an eel and two lions.

The depth of the lake generally varies with the inflow river flow. The lake flows into Khyargas Lake along a 5 km long, 200‚Äì300 m wide canal, which does not freeze in winter. In summer, the lake warms up almost to the very bottom. Even in winter, the temperature remains fairly constant, 1 - 2.5 ¬∞C.

It is composed of Blink Productions, Blinkink, Blink Art, and Blink Industries. The company's head offices are based in Soho, London. Blink is headed by managing director, James Studholme, and represents a total of 48 directors and artists across its five divisions. Blink was named \\"Production Company of the Year\\" by Campaign in 2012 for the second consecutive year, having previously held the title in 2011 and 1997. Blink was also chosen in 2011, 2014 and 2015 for the same accolade by Televisual Magazine. In both 2013 and 2015, Blink was named Production Company of The Year at the British Arrow Awards, as well as a winning a total of 18 gold and silver awards for its commercials. Blink won the Grand Prix at Cannes Lions 2016 for Harvey Nichols' \\"Shoplifters\\", having won the Film Craft Grand Prix in 2015 for John Lewis \\"Monty's Christmas\\". Overview Blink is known for discovering and developing new creative talent, and in the past has launched the careers of many successful directors. These include Ivan Zacharias, Doug Foster, Dominic Murphy, Kevin Thomas, Trevor Melvin, Dougal Wilson, Steve Reeves and Paul Gay. Blink's current roster of directors is drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds and many work across a variety of disciplines. The divisions are well integrated and collaborate frequently on productions falling outside of conventional television commercial production. James Studholme has said that in creating these subdivisions, Blink is well positioned to reach beyond the realm of traditional advertising and navigate the \\"uncharted terrain where brands and culture collide\\". Blink's peers within the advertising industry have credited the company's success to a \\"clever diversity of a brand giving it greater longevity and taking full advantage of an expanding marketplace\\". History Artist Bob Lawrie founded Blink in London in 1984 as a vehicle for his creative art and directing projects. Initially founded as an animation company doing TV program titles, Channel Idents and music promos. James Studholme joined in 1985 as producer. Blink branched out into live action in 1993 with a Red Stripe commercial for TV and cinema. Studholme bought young directors Mike Bennion and Simon Fellows into Blink. In 2000 Bob Lawrie departed leaving James Studholme at the helm. Since 2004, Blink has launched four specialised sub-divisions in addition to its commercial production company, and currently operates as an all-encompassing creative studio producing commercials, animations, art, music videos and long form content. In 2005, Blink extended their reach to the United States. James Studholme and Diane McArter (who previously founded Omaha Pictures) launched a new US production company, Furlined, as founding partners. Several of Blink's directors are represented in the USA by Furlined, who have offices in Los Angeles and New York. One of Blink's most memorable projects is Gorilla, a commercial directed by Juan Cabral for Cadbury. The advert first aired in 2007 and features an actor in a gorilla costume drumming to In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins. In its first week, the commercial was viewed over 500,000 times on YouTube and has received over 6 million views since then. Gorilla was voted ITV's favourite TV advert of 2007 and 5th best advert of the decade in an online poll by tellyads.com. It has also won numerous top advertising industry awards, such as the Film Grand Prix Lion at the Cannes Lions 2008, Gold at the British Television Advertising Awards (British Arrows) 2008 and Black and Yellow Pencils at the D&AD; Awards 2008. =Blink= Blink has been the production company's advertising-focused division since Blink was founded. In January 2018 Blink joined forces with Colonel Blimp (previously the music video production arm of Blink) to consolidate their unique and talented rosters. Blink has produced commercials for Guinness, Cadbury's, Yorkie, Nokia, Pot Noodle, Ikea, John Lewis, Channel 4 'Superhumans', Harvey Nichols and Virgin, and music videos for artists such as Coldplay, The Streets, Bj√∂rk, U2, Tinie Tempah, and The Maccabees. In 2010, Blink produced a commercial with agency Adam & Eve for John Lewis. The commercial was directed by Dougal Wilson and shows a woman ageing 70 years in 90 seconds, accompanied by Fyfe Dangerfield's cover of Billy Joel's She's Always A Woman. The advert follows a woman through her life, from her birth through school, marriage, having children and becoming a grandmother. A key factor to the advert's popularity is its emotional impact on viewers. A week after the advert first aired on television, The Guardian newspaper reported that as a result of the advert's influence, a 39.7% increase in sales on John Lewis' website was reported. To date, the advert has received over 1,000,000 total views on YouTube. The commercial won three Gold awards at the British Arrows in 2011. In 2011, Dougal Wilson repeated his success for John Lewis and Adam & Eve with The Long Wait, a commercial screened in the run-up to Christmas. The advert tells the story of a young boy counting down to Christmas Day, set to a cover of The Smiths' Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want by Slow Moving Millie. The advert was awarded 3rd place in Creativity Magazine's Best of 2011 TV and it was watched over 4,000,000 times in total on YouTube since it aired in November 2011. Since then Wilson has made several further films for John Lewis most notably, Christmas 2012's \\"Snowman\\", Christmas 2014's \\"Monty's Christmas\\", and in 2015, \\"Tiny Dancer\\". His most recent work includes \\"Superhumans\\" for Channel 4's Paralympics Rio 2016. =Colonel Blimp= Colonel Blimp was founded in 2006 as the music video production arm of Blink, and has since merged its roster with Blink. The company was named in homage to Powell and Pressburger's 1943 film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. The division once represented a roster of 19 directors and produced music videos with international reach for artists such as Coldplay, The Streets, Bj√∂rk, U2, Tinie Tempah, Kelly Rowland, Unkle, Professor Green and The Maccabees, incorporating both traditional and experimental filmmaking techniques. =Blinkink= Blinkink was founded in 2004 to specialise in animation and mixed-media filmmaking. Today Blinkink is a collective of talented directors, producers, artists and technicians who create short-form content with their partners in the advertising, music and entertainment industries. =Blink Art= Blink Art was founded in 2009 as Blink's non-traditional production arm, in response to the increasing desire of brands to interact with consumers through innovative methods. Blink Art represent photographers, illustrators and set designers working across print, animation and film. They produce work for international advertising agencies, record companies, fashion brands and design agencies. Being part of Blink, they are able to pair their artists with the right team to bring animation and film projects to life. In 2012, Blink Art was commissioned by advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi to create a monument representing the history of Guinness from 1759 to the present day. The sculpture was designed and directed by Blink Art's David Wilson and consists of a carved wooden plinth and floating light sculpture suggesting the recognisable form of a dark pint of Guinness topped with white foam. A team of carpenters, illustrators, designers and artists spent a month creating the monument, which is on display at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, Republic of Ireland.

In 1975, Formula One mechanics Gary Anderson (who worked for Brabham) and Bob Simpson (who worked for Tyrrell), built a Formula 3 car called the Anson SA1. It was based on the Brabham BT38 and was raced by Anderson in Formula Libre. Anderson left Brabham at the end of 1976 to focus on designing the Anson SA2 Formula 3 car for 1977. Last minute withdrawal of sponsorship left the project in great difficulties and part-way through 1977 the car was withdrawn. Anderson rejoined Formula One as chief mechanic at McLaren. He remained there for two years after which he joined the Ensign team. In 1980, Anderson, Simpson and ex-Rolls Royce employee Jeff Hills formed Anson Cars, which built Formula 3 and Formula Super Vee cars for the next six years. In 1985, Anderson went to America to become the chief engineer of the Galles Indycar team. In 1988, Mike McHugh purchased the company, with the goal of building Super Vee cars in California. Two months later, the two top executives in Volkswagen America who were instrumental in VW's support of the Super Vee series were killed in the Lockerbie air disaster and the market for the cars disappeared. Anson's greatest achievements as a constructor were Franz Konrad winning the 1983 German F3 Championship and Tommy Byrne finishing 6th in the 1984 European F3 Championship.

M. Barrie's Peter Pan books. She published under the names May Byron, M.C. Gillington and Maurice Clare. Byron specialised in writing biographies of great artists, before going on to rewrite some of J. M. Barrie's works for younger readers, to write poetry, and to write cookbooks. History Brookwood asylum, where Byron's father was chaplain She was born Mary Clarissa Gillington in 1861 at Audlem, Cheshire, the first of four children of John Maurice Gillington and Sarah Dumville Gillington. She was soon joined by a younger sister, Alice Elizabeth, and two younger brothers, George William and John Louis. Her Dublin-born father was an aspiring clergyman who worked as a clerk. Her mother was born in Huyton, Lancashire. The family moved to Bisley, Surrey when her father found work as a chaplain at the Brookwood Hospital, the local asylum. In 1892, Mary (\\"May\\") and her sister published a book of poems, dedicated to their parents. It included some poems that they had published previously in other books. On 27 August 1892, Gillington married George Frederick Byron, son of Henry James Byron, and went on to have two children with him, James George Byron in 1894 and Charles Byron in 1897. She went on to write a series of biographies, describing the day-to-day lives of various artists. Her series Days with the Great Composers, Days with the Great Authors, Days with the Great Poets and Days with Victorian Poets were published under a number of different pen names: her birth name, M. C. Gillington; her married name, May Byron; and her pseudonym, Maurice Clare. May Byron is best known for her authorised abridgements of the Peter Pan novels. Her original abridgement in 1915 was titled \\"Peter Pan and Wendy\\", the first to use that form. She also re-wrote the J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan novels \\"for little readers\\" or \\"for the nursery\\". Reception May Byron's biographies were generally well-received, though some critics could not tell if they were first-hand or fiction based on research. The books went on to inspire others, and her biography A Day with Shakespeare (written under the pseudonym \\"Maurice Clare\\") was particularly influential for James Joyce in writing Ulysses. Byron's poetry was published in a number of newspapers, with one critic suggesting that her poetry has a \\"wonderful power\\". He goes on to say that her poem At Bay is \\"a cry not from the heart of a woman, but from the heart of Woman\\". The Ballad of London River For Massed School Singing was popular with schools in the London area and became the \\"official song\\" for a number of schools. Her retellings of the Peter Pan books were targeted at parents who wished to read to their young children or allow their children their own copies of books. They were written in simple English, with large type and many colourful illustrations. In total, May Byron wrote over 100 books, in many different areas. She also had her poems published in newspapers.

In 1929 she appeared in the first all-talking, all-colour feature length movie ever made, Warner Bros On with the Show!, and was already well known for starring in A Girl of the Bush in 1921. Biography James was born Vera Gwendoline James on 2 April 1892, the daughter of William Francis James and Alice Jane James (n√©e Hill) of Dunedin, New Zealand. She moved to Australia in 1919 and appeared in two films for Franklyn Barrett. The first was A Girl of the Bush, which was screened in both Australia and New Zealand. Her performance in the lead role was widely praised for the versatility of her acting, her mimicry, feats of horsemanship, and her good looks. She had learned to ride horses and swim in order to land the role. The second film was Know Thy Child, in which James' character was first shown at the age of seventeen, then aged twenty-five, and finally aged about forty; \\"in each age she plays the part with restraint and dramatic skill\\". After these successes, James moved to Hollywood in 1922, with her new husband, Arthur Henry Munro, who she had married on 29 June 1921 at the Presbyterian Church, Neutral Bay, Sydney. In Hollywood, James appeared in a B-Western, McGuire of the Mounted (1923), playing a member of a drug smuggling gang who was married to the hero while he was doped. She was cast in Bavu (1923), and appeared in pre-release publicity images, but does not appear in the cast list of the final release. James also had supporting roles in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Radio Detective (1925) (a serial),'Studio and Stage', Los Angeles Times 15 Sep 1925: A11. Three Wise Men (1925) with Janet Gaynor and Ben Corbett,'Mary Pickford Premiere Set for Thursday', Los Angeles Times 16 Oct 1925: A9. Fade- Away Foster (1926), and On with the Show! which was the first all-colour, all- talking full-length movie in history. She was one of the few New Zealand actors to find some fame in Hollywood at the time. In 1928 she appeared in a production of the operetta The Desert Song. The Los Angeles Times described her as \\"not only pleasing to gaze upon, but is possessed of a beautiful contralto voice\\".'Vera James Known as Contralto too', Los Angeles Times 5 July 1928: A11. In 1929, she travelled back to Australia and New Zealand, intending to return to Hollywood the following year.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 106. However, there is no evidence that she did. She was offered parts after returning to Australia, but always turned them down. She went on to manage a beauty salon in Sydney. She died on 19 October 1980 in Sydney.

It was heard in the Transvaal Provincial Division J on September 1, 1992, by Mahomed, who handed down judgment on September 3. D. Bisschoff appeared for the applicant, and DS Fourie for the respondent.  Facts  An applicant for bail, on a continuous hunger fast, stated that he was prepared to comply with any condition of bail which the court might attach to his release, and that he would resume eating if bail were granted.  Judgment  This raised an important question of judicial policy. The court held that the applicant's statement constituted a basic and untenable challenge to the legitimacy and the credibility of the South African legal system and its courts. No court could retain any legitimacy or credibility if it were compelled to succumb to this kind of pressure. There was, in principle, no difference between the position of a man who says, \\"Release me or I will ensure that I die,\\" and a man who says, \\"Release me or I will kill somebody else\\" or \\"Release me or I will kill my wife\\" or \\"Release me or I will kill a hostage.\\" If the courts were to surrender to this kind of pressure, the very foundations of justice would be subverted in a manner which might do irreversible damage to the image of justice and to the values upon which any civilised system of law must be based. The court had an inherent jurisdiction to grant bail to a person who had been committed to prison by a magistrate in terms of the Extradition Act,Act 67 of 1962.s 10(1). even though no appeal was pending against the magistrate's finding under section 10(1).

Recognition of particular neighborhoods varies, with some having neighborhood associations, but none have any legal or political authority. The major neighborhoods, historically, include Amoskeag, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame/McGregorville and Piscataquog/Granite Square on the West Side; and the North End, Janeville/Corey Square, Hallsville and Bakersville on the East Side; along with Youngsville and Goffes Falls on the periphery of the city.http://www.davidrumsey.com/rumsey/Size4/D0115/2023042.jpg?userid=15&username;=lunaadmin&resolution;=4&servertype;=JVA&cid;=8&iid;=RUMSEY&vcid;=NA&usergroup;=Rumsey3x&profileid;=13 In 2007, the city began a Neighborhood Initiatives program to \\"insure that our neighborhoods are vibrant, livable areas since these are the portions of the city where most of the residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to school.\\" The purpose of this initiative is to foster vibrancy and redevelopment in the neighborhoods, and to restore the sense of neighborhood communities that had been overlooked in the city for some time. The city began the program with street-scape and infrastructure improvements in the Rimmon Heights neighborhood of the West Side, which has spurred growth and investment in and by the community. Despite the success of the program in Rimmon Heights, it was unclear in recent years how similar programs would be implemented elsewhere in Manchester. The city announced plans for extending the Neighborhood Initiatives program to the Hollow neighborhood in February 2012.http://www.unionleader.com/article/20120211/NEWS15/120219990 Downtown Elm Street from Bridge Street, 2009 Downtown Manchester is the historical, economic and cultural heart of the city, and a center of finance for the state. It is also the focal point for dining and nightlife in the greater Manchester area. Located along the east bank of the Merrimack River, Downtown consists of the downtown core centered along Elm Street between Bridge and Granite streets; the Millyard consisting of the former Amoskeag mills; the \\"NOB\\" (North of Bridge); and South Downtown between Granite Street and Queen City Avenue. Within these larger areas are smaller districts, such as the Gaslight and Warehouse districts in Downtown South, the Cultural District centered on the Victory Park Historic District in the Downtown Core, and the River's Edge in South Downtown. Downtown suffered high vacancy rates following the closure of several downtown-based banks in the early 1990s. It has witnessed a resurgence in recent years, however, including the continual redevelopment of the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential Historic District, and the construction of the SNHU Arena and Northeast Delta Dental Stadium. Intown Manchester, a non-profit management company was created in 1996 and contracted by the City to maintain, beautify, promote and improve Downtown. In response to the improvements area, Downtown experienced a 19.7% increase in residents between 2000 and 2010. The increasing popularity of downtown living has caused many properties originally built as tenement housing for mill workers in the 19th century to be converted to stylish, eclectic residential condominiums. Many new retail stores and higher education institutions have been uniquely retro-fitted into properties along Commercial Street and Canal Street. The Millyard is also home to several corporate offices, including Dyn, Deka, Texas Instruments and Eversource Energy New Hampshire. In addition to the growth in retail, dining, residential and entertainment venues, Downtown has also seen a growth in post-secondary and cultural institutions in recent decades. The Palace Theatre has anchored a revitalized Hanover Street since its reopening in 1973. The New Hampshire Institute of Art is located in the Victory Park National Historic District, and the University of New Hampshire at Manchester concentrated its campus in the Millyard between 1999 and 2001. In 2002, the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences opened a secondary campus in the NOB. Downtown is home to northern New England's tallest buildings. City Hall Plaza is the tallest New England building north of Cambridge, Massachusetts, followed closely by the all-black Brady Sullivan Plaza‚Äîshorter than City Hall Plaza by only a few feet‚Äîboth of which are 20 stories high. Other prominent buildings in the Downtown skyline include Manchester's original \\"skyscraper,\\" the New Hampshire headquarters of Citizens Bank located in the Amoskeag Bank building; Brady-Sullivan Tower, formerly known as New Hampshire Tower; the Carpenter Center; the Wall Street Tower; and Anthem Tower. Viewed from the west and from I-293, the vertical lines of these buildings are contrasted with the massive, horizontal Millyard below them along the banks of the Merrimack River.

The Salon sold color posters, prints and reproductions of artwork to the general public at reasonable prices. It was established in February 1894 by L√©on Deschamps, founder of La Plume (\\"The Pen\\") an avant garde literary and artistic magazine. It became known for its exhibitions showcasing the works of contemporary graphical artists. The salon held exhibitions until 1900. Many of the posters advertising Salon des Cent exhibitions have themselves become collectors' items. La Plume La Plume was an artistic and literary journal founded by L√©on Deschamps in 1889, at first located on 36 Boulevard Arago. Articles in La Plume covered a broad range of subjects ranging from realism, socialism and anarchism to Catholic mysticism and the aristocracy. The journal moved to 31 Rue Bonaparte in July 1891, where the spacious new offices gave room to mount art exhibitions. Before these began, La Plume displayed various objects in the \\"Salon de la Plume\\", with the visual arts taking second place to objects associated with literature, poetry and philosophy. Advances in color lithography in the 1890s made it practical to make large posters for use as advertisements, and also for art collectors. A poster craze developed, with huge demand for Art Nouveau lithographs in Europe and America. The growing focus of La Plume on contemporary graphical art was clearly established by the publication of an issue of La Plume in November 1893 dedicated to the history of the poster. At times the magazine would devote a special issue to one artist. These included Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, James Ensor, Alexandre Falgui√®re, Andr√© des Gachons, Eug√®ne Grasset, Henry de Groux, Alphonse Mucha and Auguste Rodin. Salon In theory Le Salon des Cent was a group of one hundred artists, hence the name, but there was never a precise list and participation varied. Some artists were invited to become members, including Puvis de Chavannes, Jules Ch√©ret, Grasset and Marcellin Desboutin. Others were simply artists who had been asked to participate in exhibitions. The salon had no jury and no prizes, and the artists could choose what they wanted to exhibit, being constrained only by the available space. The Salon des Cent publicized itself as a permanent, constantly changing exhibition of its members' works. It exerted considerable influence on development of the Art Nouveau poster. Le Salon des Cent usually exhibited in a set of rooms within the magazine premises. An exhibition of the Salon des Cent was announced in October 1891, and again in February 1892, but in fact the first exhibition at 31 Rue Bonaparte was not until 1 February 1894. In addition to the sales catalogs for the works of various artists, the many special editions of La Plume served as catalogs for specific exhibitions. The Salon also commissioned special posters for its exhibitions. The Salon built up a huge collection of original posters from many countries, and acted as both wholesaler and retailer of these works. The collection included all of Mucha's posters and paintings, and many by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Berthon, de Feure and the Glasgow Four as well as American artists. Artists Poster for the second Salon in April 1894 by Eug√®ne Grasset Eug√®ne Grasset was active in the Salon des Cent. He first tackled the Art Nouveau poster style in his posters for the 1894 Salon des Cents. The second exhibition, which opened on 3 April 1894, was entirely devoted to his works. A special edition of La Plume of 15 May 1894 was dedicated to Grasset. The poster by Grasset for the fifth Salon des Cent announced the themes that would dominate painting in the following years, and has been widely reproduced. In many ways it copies the poster for the second Salon. It reflects Grasset's interest in medieval times. The poster, filling the frame with a bold composition, shows a simply-dressed young woman gazing thoughtfully at an umbel of angelica. In January 1895 Mucha's Art Nouveau poster for Sarah Bernhardt as Gismonda was displayed across Paris. The next year Mucha created the poster for the 20th Salon exhibition, which opened on 22 April 1896. When L√©on Deschamps saw the draft he told Mucha, \\"Execute this design just as it is, and you will have created the masterpiece of the illustrated decorative poster.\\" In June 1897 the Salon put on an exhibition dedicated to Mucha. Some of the posters by Mucha and Grasset were printed in very limited editions on silk satin. Georges de Feure exhibited for the first time at the fourth Salon des Cent, which took place at the Boulogne-sur-Mer Casino for the whole month of August 1894. The fifth exhibition, at 31 rue Bonaparte from 5‚Äì30 October 1894, exhibited almost the same works. Georges de Feure was to exhibit at the Salon for several years. L√©on Deschamps and La Plume played a major role in the artistic development of his posters. Toulouse-Lautrec exhibited several times at the Salon des Cent between 1895 and 1898. Lautrec's La Passagere du 54 ‚Äì Promenade en Yacht was used as the poster for the 1896 opening of the International Poster Exhibition at the Salons des Cent. His series Elles was exhibited as a whole for the first time in 1896 at the 20th Salon exhibition. James Ensor exhibited some of his etchings at the Salon in 1898, using an 1888 drawing called Demons teasing me as a poster for the exhibit. La Plume published a special edition to accompany the show that included several articles praising his work. This was Ensor's first one-man exhibition outside Belgium. Other posters included classic Art Nouveau images by Paul Berthon, Fernand Fau, Ars√®ne Herbinier and Firmin Bouisset. Notable artists who showcased at the Salon des Cent also included Albert Andr√©, Pierre Bonnard, Fr√©d√©ric-Auguste Cazals, Edgar Degas, Henri Evenepoel, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gustave-Henri Jossot, Ren√© Lalique, Henri Matisse, Gustave Moreau and Louis Valtat.

Yamamoto championed the view that civilian diplomacy and person-to-person exchanges conducted by nongovernmental organizations had a critical role to play in international relations. He was the founder and longtime president of the Japan Center for International Exchange (JCIE) a foreign policy think tank established in 1970 which promotes bilateral relations and exchanges between nongovernmental organizations. Yamamoto also helped to found the Shimoda Conference in 1967, a private sector forum for the discussion of bilateral issues between American and Japanese policymakers and policy experts. The Wall Street Journal has called him \\"an ardent champion of the U.S.-Japan alliance.\\" Yamamoto served as the President of the Japan Center for International Exchange (JCIE) from 1970 until his death in 2012. As head of the JCIE, Yamamoto simultaneously served as director for a number of forums, including the German-Japan Forum, the UK-Japan 21st Century Group, the Korea-Japan Forum, the Trilateral Commission Pacific Asia Group, and the Friends of the Global Fund, Japan, which works to promote the goals of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria throughout Asia. In addition to the Shimoda Conference and the JCIE, Yamamoto also founded the Korea-Japan Forum, the U.S.-Japan Parliamentary Exchange Program, and the Trilateral Commission. Biography =Early life= Yamamoto was born in 1936 into a Japanese Catholic family in Tokyo. His family moved to Hong Kong when he was three months old. The family then moved to Bombay, British India, where they lived for seven months. Yamamoto and his family returned to Japan in 1940. He initially studied at Rokko Senior High School before transferring to Komaba High School, from which he graduated in 1953. He enrolled at Sophia University in 1954 with the intention of becoming a Catholic priest. However, his career path changed when he transferred from Sophia University in Japan to St. Norbert College in the U.S. state of Wisconsin in 1958. He studied in the United States from 1958 until 1962, receiving his MBA from Marquette University, a Jesuit university in Milwaukee, in 1962. He became interested in the social changes occurring in the U.S. at the time, including the civil rights movement, and the election of President John F. Kennedy, whose table he waited on during the 1960 campaign. The progressive ideals that they advocated and the values of ‚Äúlove and community‚Äù which he saw reflected in the Vatican II reforms of the same era became the inspiration for his later work. He married his wife, Chiyoko Aikawa, in 1966, and they had four sons together. =Career= After graduating from Marquette in 1962 he returned to Japan where he worked at the Shin-Etsu Chemical Company as the foreign relations secretary for Tokusaburo Kosaka, the then president of Shin-Etsu who would later be elected to the House of Representatives of Japan. Working for Kosaka, Yamamoto helped organize and found the first Shimoda Conference in Shimoda, Japan, in 1967, where United States Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield served as the keynote speaker. The inaugural Shimoda Conference was the first postwar meeting to convene political leaders and public intellectuals from the United States and Japan on equal footing for a foreign policy dialogue, and it came to be seen as a milestone in Japan‚Äôs reemergence on the world stage. The conference, which was held regularly until the 1990s, became a leading avenue to promote private sector dialogue between the two countries. In February 2012, Yamamoto organized a relaunch of the Shimoda Conference, which had not been held in seventeen years. During his keynote speech at the 1967 Shimoda Conference, Mansfield made a public call for the establishment of a privately sponsored exchange between members of the US Congress and the Japanese Diet so they could build mutual understanding and speak frankly and off-the-record about common challenges. In response, Yamamoto launched the first ever US-Japan parliamentary exchange in 1968. These exchanges are credited by early participants, such as Speaker of the US House of Representatives Tom Foley, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, for introducing a generation of American leaders to Japan and creating the personal ties that later were important in defusing trade tensions and strengthening bilateral cooperation in a range of areas. This led Foley to remark that he knew ‚Äúof no more important individual so effective in strengthening our bilateral ties.‚Äù In 1970, after managing Tokusaburo Kosaka's successful campaign for a Diet seat, Yamamoto made the decision that he could best contribute to Japan's international relations by leaving Kosaka's employment and creating an independent, nongovernmental and nonpartisan policy institute. He founded the Japan Center for International Exchange (JCIE) in 1970 and, while growing it into one of the country‚Äôs most prominent international affairs institutes, and he remained fiercely insistent that it could only contribute to Japan and the world by maintaining complete autonomy from government influence. As a member of the US House of Representatives, Donald Rumsfeld was among the first participant in JCIE's US-Japan Parliamentary Exchange, beginning a long professional relationship between Yamamoto and Rumsfeld. In 1975, Yamamoto organized a meeting at the White House between Rumsfeld, who was the White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford, and the Vice Chairman of the now defunct Japanese Socialist Party, Saburo Eda. Yamamoto made the meeting possible, despite Socialist Party's opposition to the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. As the first meeting between the Socialists and US government officials in 23 years, the visit opened the way for a new engagement with Japan‚Äôs main opposition party. In 1973, Yamamoto became a founding member of the Trilateral Commission, which organizes policy dialogues involving international affairs experts, political leaders, business executives, journalists, and other societal leaders in Asia with counterparts from democracies in North America and Europe. At a time when international affairs dialogues focused almost solely on Europe and the United States, the Commission was created to engage Japan, then a rising power, as a full-fledged member in international dialogue and the launch of the Commission symbolized Japan‚Äôs acceptance as an equal partner in global affairs. The Commission is still active in the 2010s. Yamamoto worked directly with numerous Prime Ministers of Japan and their administrations during his career as well. Yamamoto became the director of the Japan-US Economic Relations Group from 1979 to 1981, the US-Japan Advisory Commission fromn 1983 to 1984, and the Korea-Japan 21st Century Committee from 1988 until 1991. He was appointed to both the First and Second Prime Minister‚Äôs Private Council on International Cultural Exchange; the first Council from 1988 to 1989 and again during the Second Council from 1993 until 1994. Former Prime Minister Keiz≈ç Obuchi appointed Yamamoto as the executive director of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Commission on Japan‚Äôs Goals in the 21st Century from 1999 to 2000. In February 2010, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama named Yamamoto to a policy panel on defense issues. Yamamoto's interests broadened from the United States during his career, which spanned 50 years. He promoted improved relations with Europe, South Korea, China, and Southeast Asia through the nongovernmental exchanges and Track 2 policy dialogues. He played an important role in efforts to strengthen regional cooperation among Asian countries. Also, after the end of the Cold War, he quietly became one of Japan‚Äôs key proponents of the concept of human security, a more comprehensive approach to ensuring the security of individuals and not just national borders. As informal advisor to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other leaders, his influence paved the way for Japan‚Äôs adoption of the approach as a main tenet of the country‚Äôs foreign policy. While promoting policy dialogues and political leadership exchanges, Yamamoto also championed efforts to develop Japan's nonprofit sector and to encourage the growth of philanthropy in Asia. As a result, JCIE played an important role in efforts by Keidanren and other business organizations to increase corporate philanthropy in Japan. During his later years, Yamamoto worked to strengthen Japan's contributions to global health and the fight against HIV/AIDS and other major communicable diseases in Africa and other parts of the developing world. He established the Friends of the Global Fund, Japan, inside of JCIE, which advocates a greater Japanese support for the Global Fund and deeper government, business, and grassroots engagement in the campaign against disease in poorer countries. By bringing Japanese politicians to Africa to speak with people battling AIDS and arranging for overseas celebrities such as Bono to raise awareness of the need for Japan to do more to help poor countries, the initiative played a key role in encouraging the Japanese government to triple its annual contribution to the Global Fund from 2005 to 2012, making it one of the world‚Äôs most generous supporters of the battle against the global AIDS epidemic. Yamamoto received awards and commendations from the governments of Australia, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. He became the recipient of the US-Japan Foundation Distinguished Service Award in 2008. On July 5, 2011, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon by the Emperor of Japan. In April 2012, Yamamoto reportedly told the former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Koichi Kato, that, \\"I want to promote exchanges between Japanese and U.S. politicians, but I cannot because Japanese politics has wasted away. I am embarrassed.\\" =Death= Tadashi Yamamoto died from gallbladder cancer at a hospital in Tokyo on April 15, 2012, at the age of 76. His funeral was held at St. Ignatius Catholic Church in Tokyo on April 18. Columbia University professor Gerald Curtis, who knew Yamamoto for more than forty years, noted that he never abandoned his beliefs that exchanges between democracies should be spearheaded by the private sector. The former director of the editorial board at Asahi Shimbun, Yukio Matsuyama, also stated that, \\"Yamamoto did more for international exchange than anyone else did, both in name and reality, having had nothing to start with ...

Reception The novel received a positive reception from reviewers. Kirkus Reviews called the novel a \\"fast-paced improbable adventure\\", stating that readers \\"will quickly warm to Eddie\\" and that it is \\"a good choice for reluctant readers\\"; although they do state that this is an easier read if you read Reservoir Pups beforehand. In a review aimed at younger readers, Kidzworld stated that \\"the worst part about Eddie's adventures is that Eddie and his friends basically spend the first half of the book getting beaten up and abused\\"; although this is somewhat mitigated as \\"it's fun to read about Eddie and his gang saving the day at last\\". They awarded the book a score of four out of five stars. Conan Tigard, writing for Reading Review, praised the novels pace, characters and believability, stating that he read the book in one sitting. Tigard comments that he found many references to the first book in the series, although did not think it necessary to read it first. In conclusion, he stated \\"overall, I thought that Bring Me the Head of Oliver Plunkett was an excellent story with fun and excitement that all readers will enjoy. Bravo, Colin Bateman. Way to go!\\" and awarded the novel a score of nine out of ten. Cooper Renner, for the School Library Journal, praised the \\"marvelously over-the-top plot\\"; the \\"likable, down-to-earth main characters\\"; and stated that \\"plot-turns worthy of an adult thriller keep the pages turning, and Bateman's light touch keeps the violence from seeming as frightening as it otherwise might\\". Renner concluded by saying that this novel is \\"a first-rate achievement, and a truly comic novel with a plot that never lets up\\". Booklist stated that \\"there's nothing subtle here\\" and that there is much that is \\"specifically Irish and Catholic\\", however tempered this somewhat by stating that \\"readers already familiar with Eddie will enjoy Bateman's wry humor, nutty characters, and swift-moving plot\\".

As a swimmer Agnew represented Australia at the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics, as well as the 1950 British Empire Games. After retiring from swimming he entered business, becoming involved in the resources industry in Western Australia. Early life Agnew was born 21 September 1930 in the Perth suburb of Nedlands to Robert and Jean Agnew (n√©e Dorothy Jean McHarg Wilson). As a boy he attended Perth Modern School where he was a year below then-future Prime Minister Bob Hawke. After graduating he attended the University of Western Australia (UWA) from 1949 studying engineering. In 1950 received an offer to attend Yale University on an athletic scholarship where he would swim alongside his Australian rival John Marshall. He eventually chose to attend Ohio State University. His passage to America involved working in the engine room of a ship between Brisbane and Vancouver. He was a member of the Ohio State branch of Phi Beta Kappa Society. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1952. Two years later he finished a Master of Business Administration degree at Harvard University in 1954. Swimming As a 17-year-old Agnew went to the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, competing in the 400 metre and 1500 metre freestyle events though he did not make it past the heats. He was the men's 440 yards freestyle champion and was part of the 4√ó220 yards freestyle relay team that came second at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, New Zealand. At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, he again competed in the 400 and 1500-metre events, again not advancing past the preliminary heats. Agnew retired from swimming 1954, citing a desire to enter business. Business Agnew spent time in 1954 working in Manila with Gus Trippe, an American he met at Harvard. On returning to Perth in 1955, Agnew was part of a partnership, including Trippe, that purchased a steam boat to ship live cattle from Anna Plains Station in northwest Western Australia to The Philippines. This was the first time cattle had been shipped live out of the state. He soon extended his business interests to mining salt and iron ore. He formed a partnership with Harold Clough during the 1970s. In 1977 Mount Enid Mining Company, controlled by Agnew, sold its interests in the Robe River mining project for over 21 million. In 1980, Agnew led a group proposing the establishment of a new Australian trading bank. This resulted in the opening of Australian Bank in early 1981, with Agnew as its first chairman. Game fishing Agnew was a keen fisherman. He regularly made a trip of over from Perth to Cairns to catch large fish. In 1983 he set a Western Australian record when he caught a Pacific blue marlin. He was inducted into the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame in 2003. Honours Agnew became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1978.

It is the oldest castle on the island, first mentioned in 1329. The main building was built in 1300‚Äì1585, with major rebuilding especially in 1768 and in 1889 under Hans J√∏rgen Holm and Gotfred Tvede. Inscriptions in the building show that it was originally completed in 1585. History Aalholm Castle in the 17th century The castle was initially the seat of the king's vassal or lensmand, and thus the centre of local government. It is not known when the castle was founded, but for historical reasons, it was probably around 1200. During this period, a number of royal castles were built across the country to strengthen the king's power in the regions and guard against attack. They include Koldinghus, Riberhus, Copenhagen Castle, N√¶sbyhoved Castle near Odense, S√∏nderborg and Nordborg on the island of Als, T√•rnborg near Kors√∏r, Nyborg, Gurre Castle and S√∏borg in the north of Zealand, Ravnsborg in northern Lolland and many more. Aalholm was located on a very favorable site, standing on a little island in the inlet known as Nysted Nor. Completely surrounded by water, it was protected from the open sea although ships of all kinds could sail right up to the island, provided they had crews conversant with the channel to be followed. Not far to the north and west, there was fertile land where produce could be grown for the castle, with a surplus for the vassal and the king. Moreover, Nysted Nor was the only suitable site for a building of the kind between Nakskov in the south of Lolland and Stubbek√∏bing in the northeast of Falster. The importance of the area at the time can also be appreciated from the fact that the Franciscan monastery in Nysted, built in 1286, was the only one on the islands, especially as the Franciscans always settled in thriving, populated areas where they could rely on the support of the inhabitants. However, it is impossible to trace the early history of the castle as there are no written sources and any archaeological evidence is hidden beneath today's building. The castle has been built and rebuilt even since it was founded. The oldest part of the existing building is the north wing, thought to date from the 14th and 15th centuries. Thereafter, there is plenty of documentation on restoration and refurbishment, sometimes also revealing the poor state of the building. For example, in the 1550s, bricks from the Franciscan monastery were used to repair the castle while after the Swedish Wars of 1657-1660, the building had no windows and the towers no roofs. In the 18th century, parts of the south wing were demolished and the east wing was fully renovated. In 1889, a further section of the south wing was pulled down and two new lateral wings were added on the south side of the north wing. As a result, the once rectangular structure now took on a shape resembling a pair of spectacles. Since then there have been no significant changes to the castle's exterior. In the 1970s, parts of the castle were opened to the public as a museum, while the former owner established a vintage car museum on Stubberup Farm about one kilometer to the west of the castle. In connection with the sale of the castle and estate in 1995, all the furnishings were auctioned off while the new owner took over the automobile museum. The museum was closed in 2008 owing to the poor state of the buildings. The cars were sold by RM Auctions on August 12, 2012, realizing sales of 10.2 million Euros. Surroundings Early on, possibly from the outset, there was an access causeway from S√∏str√¶de and Slotsgade in Nysted. It traced an S-shaped course to the south of the castle, possibly all the way to the opposite bank where the castle's farm buildings once stood. Beside the south wing, there was a bridge to the dam. As time went by, groundfilling works were undertaken and in 1796 a small garden was added on the west side of the castle. In 1814 and during the 1830s, a large park- like facility was built in Hestehave Woods southwest of the farm. At some point, maybe in the 1890s, a walled garden with greenhouses and a water tower was added west of the castle. To the north of the lake which formed after the dam was built there is now a road, No. 283 from Nysted to Saksk√∏bing and Rodby. It was built over rather swampy ground but it is unclear exactly when. Although it appears on a map from 1807, it is probably older. In connection with the change of ownership in 1889, the dam south of the castle was closed to the public and a new smaller dam was built on the north side in order to provide additional land. Part of the lake to the north of the new dam was drained and used for cattle. After the pumps were turned off in 2008, the area has once again become a shallow lake. The king's vassals or lensm√¶nd The king's castles which were spread across the country were run by vassals who were responsible for defending the area and either had to provide the king with produce or lend him money in return for the revenues they received. In many cases, however, the vassals appointed a representative to run the castle and its district as they often owned farms elsewhere in the country and were also required to fight in the king's wars. We know a number of Aalholm's vassals, many of them members of the Danish nobility. Later, some of them stemmed from Mecklenburg or Holstein, simply acting in as officials. In certain periods, the kings would allow their widowed mothers to enjoy the benefits of the castles, providing them with a pension. Aalholm Amt After Frederik III's coup establishing an autocratic regime in Denmark, the feudal approach was abolished. Aalholm became an amt or county with an administration consisting of civil servants. These officers did not necessarily live at Aalholm. Some lived in their own homes, some in nearby Nyk√∏bing. In the 65 years from 1660 to 1725 when the estate was sold to Emerentia von Levetzow, the castle often lay empty.

It was heard in the Namibia High Court from 18 to 20 April 1990, by Mahomed AJ, who handed down judgment on 23 April 1990. T. Grobbelaar SC (with him GH Oosthuizen) appeared for the accused, and H. Heyman for the State.  Adjournments  Section 168 of the Criminal Procedure Act,Act 51 of 1977. in terms of which a court may adjourn proceedings \\"if [... it] deems it necessary or expedient,\\" bestows upon the court seized with the matter a judicial discretion as to whether to grant an adjournment or not. The word \\"necessary\\" in the section means \\"reasonably necessary\\" in the particular circumstances of the case, and \\"expedient,\\" in the context, refers to what is advantageous or judicious or proper or suitable to the case. When an adjournment is sought in order to call witnesses who are not available in court, the court would, ordinarily, wish to satisfy itself as to # whether the witnesses whom the party seeks to call on the adjourned date are material witnesses; and # whether there is a reasonable expectation (not a certainty) that the attendance of such witnesses will be procured on the adjourned date. The fact that these two basic requirements are met does not mean that the court must necessarily exercise its discretion in favour of an adjournment. Other circumstances which would bear upon the exercise of a discretion include the following: * the length of the adjournment sought; * how long the case has been pending; * the duration of and reasons for any previous adjournments; * whether or not there has been any remissness from the party seeking the adjournment and, if so, the degree and nature of such remissness; * the seriousness of the offence with which the accused is charged; * the attitude and the legitimate and reasonable needs and concerns of the adversary of the party seeking the adjournment; * the resources and capacity and ability of the party affected by the adjournment to protect and advance its case on the adjourned date; * the financial prejudice caused to such party by the adjournment; * the public interest in the matter; and * whether or not the accused is in the interim to be kept in custody.  Facts  The accused, an Irish citizen, had been charged with the murder of a prominent member of SWAPO. He had been arrested on 13 September 1989, and had been in continued custody thereafter. The accused was to be arraigned on the charge of murder in the Supreme Court on 18 April 1990. On 2 March, the investigating officer had procured warrants for the arrest of two South Africans suspected of complicity in the murder. No trace of the two could be found prior to the independence of Namibia on 21 March 1990, although they surfaced openly in South Africa thereafter. The State also required the presence of four South African witnesses, upon whom subpoenas were served, through their legal representative, on 2 April. With the advent of independence, the Namibian State no longer had the means to compel the attendance of any of the six South Africans. When the accused appeared in the High Court on 18 April, the State sought an adjournment of some six weeks to enable it to procure the attendance of the six absentees. It was the State's case that the evidence sought to be led by the four witnesses was material, in that such evidence would show that the accused had had a motive to kill the deceased. It was submitted that such evidence would show that the accused had been connected with the Civil Co-operation Bureau (a division of the Department of Defence of the Republic of South Africa), which body had had an interest in eliminating the deceased. The joinder of the two co-accused was contended to be important in order to strengthen the State's case against the accused, because it would render admissible against the accused certain additional evidence on the basis of common purpose. It was pointed out, for the accused, * that the absentees were resident in a foreign jurisdiction; * that, on the evidence of the investigating officer, there appeared to be no reasonable prospect of their voluntarily coming to Namibia either as witnesses or to stand trial as co-accused; and * that, as experienced policemen, they had the knowledge and skills to avoid apprehension. The response of the State was that the machinery of international diplomacy might secure the appearance of the absentees in court.  Judgment  The court pointed out that each of the legal mechanisms, all South African, which the State had suggested might be employed to procure the attendance of the absenteesExtradition Act 67 of 1962.Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977, s 171, read with s 33 of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959.Criminal Procedure Act, s 328. would have to involve successful diplomatic initiatives between the governments of the Republics of Namibia and South Africa. It concluded, from the very limited evidence which the State was able to tender concerning such diplomatic initiatives, that there was no reasonable prospect that the absentees concerned would be procured by the State to enable it to proceed on the merits on the adjourned date some six weeks later. The court decided, however, to adjourn the proceedings for some two weeks for the limited purpose of affording the State an opportunity of obtaining some tangible and specific evidence of diplomatic initiatives which would enable the court to decide whether a long adjournment should thereafter be granted or considered, with the caveat that, should such tangible information not be forthcoming, the State would have to elect whether to proceed with the trial with such evidence as it would then be able to lead, or to withdraw the charges. The reasons for this decision were the following: # The murder of the deceased was a matter of fundamental public importance. He had been a prominent public figure who had been a member of the present governing party and during his lifetime had been perceived to be a vigorous proponent of the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and to emancipation from colonialism and racism. The vigorous prosecution of whoever might have been responsible for his cold-blooded murder was clearly in the public interest and crucial to the administration and image of justice in Namibia. Such image and that interest might prejudicially be impaired if there followed a perception in the public that justice had been defeated by procedural complexities, by legal stratagems, by tactical manoeuvres or by any improper collusion. # The dilemma in which the State had found itself had arisen from the very extraordinary circumstances created by the position of a nation in transition, caught between the certainty of its colonial mechanisms and the articulation and effectiveness of the new mechanisms created to underpin and support its birth as a new and independent State. The State had found itself with warrants validly issued in the old State, but not easily enforceable on the date when they needed to be enforced. It was entitled to a fair opportunity to show with what promptitude and effect it could clear the grey areas attendant upon the transition from the old to the new. # Relevant to the prospects of successful diplomatic initiatives, which might lead to the procurement of the absentees concerned, was the likely attitude of the neighbouring state, South Africa, to the legitimate needs of Namibia to secure justice for its own inhabitants. It was not to be believed that either Namibia or South Africa, in the pursuit of their mutual interests, would ever deliberately wish to protect those within their borders who had seriously invaded the rights of the residents of a neighbouring country, or who sought to escape from their obligations to assist the courts of that country in determining the guilt or otherwise of those accused of having done so. In this regard, the Court referred to a speech made by the State President of South Africa, in response to a call by the Foreign Minister of Namibia for an investigation into the circumstances of the death of the deceased, in which the State President undertook to co-operate closely with the Namibian authorities in order to ensure that the law took its course and that justice be done. The court held that such undertaking would clearly be relevant to the Namibian State's prospects of success in initiating any diplomatic mechanisms to procure the attendance of the absentee persons concerned. # The State had received definite information only on 12 April that the absentee witnesses were resisting attendance in court. That had left the State with very few days in which to set in motion the necessary diplomatic initiatives. # Any prejudice to the accused caused by a short postponement for the limited purpose stated would substantially be mitigated if he were released on bail in the interim, if bail could properly be allowed in all the circumstances. The State opposed the granting of bail on the grounds that there was a danger that the accused would not stand trial, regard being had to the fact that he was an Irish citizen with no real roots in Namibia or in any African country; that there was no existing extradition treaty with Ireland; and that the Namibian borders were extensive and difficult to police. The court held that the following were considerations which should be taken into account in deciding whether to grant bail to an accused person: * Was it more likely that the accused would stand his trial or was it more likely that he would abscond and forfeit his bail? The determination of that issue involved a consideration of sub-issues such as ** how deep his emotional, occupational, and family roots within the country where he was to stand trial were; ** what his assets in that country were; ** what means he had to flee from the country; ** how much he could afford the forfeiture of the bail money; ** what travel documents he had to enable him to leave the country; ** what arrangements existed or might later exist to extradite him if he fled to another country; ** how inherently serious was the offence in respect of which he had been charged; ** how strong the case against him was and how much inducement there would be for him to avoid standing trial; ** how severe the punishment was likely to be if he were found guilty; and ** how stringent were the conditions of his bail and how difficult would it be for him to evade effective policing of his movements. * Was there a reasonable likelihood that, if the accused were released on bail, he would tamper with witnesses or interfere with the relevant evidence or cause such evidence to be suppressed or distorted? The determination of this issue involved an examination of other factors, such as ** whether or not the accused was aware of the identity of such witnesses or of the nature of such evidence; ** whether or not the witnesses concerned had already made their statements and had committed themselves to giving evidence or whether it was still the subject-matter of continuing investigations; ** what the accused's relationship with such witnesses was and whether or not it was likely that they might be influenced or intimidated by him; and ** whether or not any condition preventing communication between such witnesses and the accused could effectively be policed. * How prejudicial might it be for the accused in all the circumstances to be kept in custody by being denied bail? This involved an examination of issues such as ** the duration for which the accused had already been incarcerated; ** the duration for which he would have to be in custody before his trial was completed; ** the cause of any delay in the completion of his trial and whether or not the accused was wholly or partially to be blamed for such delay; ** the extent to which the accused needed to keep working in order to meet his financial obligations; ** the extent to which he might be prejudiced in engaging legal assistance for his defence and in effectively preparing his defence if he were to remain in custody; and ** the health of the accused. After applying the above considerations to the circumstances of the case, the Court concluded that bail should be allowed subject to stringent conditions designed to minimise the danger that the accused might abscond or otherwise prejudice the interests of justice. It was accordingly ordered that the accused be released on bail of R4,000, subject to stringent conditions as to reporting to the police and subject to strict limitations upon * the accused's freedom to leave his home address outside of working and reporting hours; and * his freedom of movement between his home address, his work address and the police station.

Early life Douglas Emery was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex on 4 January 1919. He was called up in 1939 and joined the Essex Regiment where as a Lance Sergeant, he was engaged in peacekeeping duties in Palestine until January 1944. Emery was transferred to ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company of the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment and was promoted to full Sergeant. He then took part in the Anzio landings where he was wounded when an ammunition dump took a direct hit from a shell. Assault on Monte Cece On 6 October 1944 the 1st Battalion of the DWR were ordered to assault the strategically important peak of Monte Cece as it was blocking any further advance along ‚ÄòArrow‚Äô route through the Apennine Mountain range. The Germans were well dug in and despite attacks by the Sherwood Foresters and the King's Shropshire Light Infantry were still firmly entrenched there. Due to many days of heavy rain the conditions were appalling; even the pack mules used to transport the men and equipment struggled in the knee-deep mud. That night the first attack was met with heavy machine gun and mortar fire and ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company was forced to withdraw under a heavy smoke barrage. ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company had thought they had reached the ridge, but as dawn broke they found that the crest was still some distance above them. The next day was spent carrying out reconnaissance, and a plan of attack for the next day (8 October) was formed. ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company was to lead the assault with ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company in close support. ‚ÄòB‚Äô Company was to be kept in reserve and hold the position that ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company took on the 6th. At 15:30 on the afternoon of 8 October ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company began their advance through mud so deep that the men were reduced to crawling in places. After furious hand-to-hand fighting, ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company took the left side of the summit. But they came under heavy fire from a number of machine guns from a position 100 yards to the right, which resulted in the death of the CO, Lt Col Sheil. Captain Arthur Burns immediately assumed command and ordered two platoons of ‚ÄòA‚Äô Company to attack their position. The lead platoon's advance stopped after taking casualties. But Sergeant Emery with Private Richard Burton, who was firing a discarded Bren Gun from his hip, led the platoon from the front on a decisive charge which succeeded in securing the objective. The enemy immediately counter- attacked, and Sgt Emery took up a position in front of his men and directed their fire with such effect that the attack was quickly repulsed after the enemy had taken heavy casualties, many of whom had fallen to Emery's own Tommy Gun. That night the Germans counter-attacked again, but the men of the DWR held the position. DCM award After Monte Cece, the 1st Battalion of the DWR was posted to Palestine. It was there that Sgt. Emery learned that he had been awarded the DCM. In a letter to the Iron Duke (the Regimental Magazine), he wrote: \\"When we were resting in Palestine, Dick Burton, my platoon runner and good friend [and I], were told to report to Battalion HQ. The Commanding Officer informed us that Dick Burton had been awarded the Victoria Cross and I the Distinguished Conduct Medal. As it was in the London Gazette as an Immediate Award, we were given the appropriate ribbon to wear. I felt very proud to be able to write home to [tell] my wife that we would be going to an investiture at Buckingham Palace to receive the medal from King George VI.\\" His citation reads: \\"Throughout the whole action which lasted until the early morning of 9th October, Sgt. Emery displayed not only the highest qualities of leadership and devotion to duty, but also showed an utter disregard for his own safety during a time of extreme danger. When not engaged actively in attacking and directing fire onto the enemy, Sgt. Emery was a constant source of encouragement and cheerfulness to his men, moving amongst them and directing the evacuation of the wounded. There is no doubt that it was in a very large part due to Sgt. Emery's conspicuous bravery that the assault on Monte Cece was a success.\\" Private Richard Burton was awarded the Victoria Cross, Captain Arthur Burns was awarded the DSO and three other men were awarded the Military Medal. Monte Cece is commemorated as a Battle Honour on the Regimental Colours. Post war Sgt. Emery turned down a commission and left the army in February 1946. He then had a long and distinguished career with HM Customs and Excise until he retired in 1984. In the same year he was awarded the British Empire Medal for \\"... recognition of your loyal dedicated service to the dept, in the course of which your reliability and willingness to work beyond the call of duty have earned you the respect of all your colleagues.\\" As stated by Sir Douglas Lovelock KCB, Chairman of H M Customs and Excise in his letter of congratulations. Douglas died in March 2008, he was survived by his wife, son and daughter. References 1\\\\. The Iron Duke (The regimental magazine) 2\\\\.

(1874), Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden. Deel 17. Tweede stuk p.1138-1139 (Dutch) Sybrandi was born as son of the Haarlem Mennonite minister Sybren Klazes Sybrandi and enjoyed a privileged education. First he attended Latin school in Haarlem, and was then, 17 years of age, admitted 'with high expectations' at the Kweekschool der algemeene Doopsgezinde Societeit te Amsterdam (Seminary of the General Mennonite Society in Amsterdam) where he developed an affection for classical literature - supposedly larger than his interest in theology.C.Sepp (1873), Handelingen der algemeene vergadering van de Maatschappij der Nederlandsche Letterkunde te Leiden, gehouden aldaar den 19den Juni 1873, in het gebouw der Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen. p.51-67 (Dutch) In 1827 he was promoted to doctor in literature at the Leidsche Hoogeschool. In 1830 he became minister of the Mennonite congregation in Nijmegen (in the far east of the Netherlands), in 1832 he refused a position in Middelburg (in the far southwest) but in 1834 he did accept a new position in Groningen, a university city in the north of the country, to lead the congregation there. In 1838 he finally moved back to his home town to become minister at the Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem. Already in Nijmegen he published some works about literature and in Groningen he made friends under the university teachers there. In 1841 his work Verhandeling over Vondel en Shakespear als Treurspeldichters was awarded a gold medal by Teylers Tweede Genootschap (Teylers Second or Scientific society) and he became main editor of Konst- en Letterbode until 1853 (following the sudden death of the previous main editor, Vincent Loosjes).P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (red.), Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek (Dutch)K. ter Laan, Letterkundig woordenboek voor Noord en Zuid (Dutch) He initially only planned to do this for a short while but then continued to do so and wrote many pieces for the literary magazine - several of which anonymously. Sybrandi was above all however a minister and Mennonite teacher, and spoke out against the unification of all Protestant churches into one single church. Shortly after his arrival in Haarlem Sybrandi became a member of Teylers Eerste Genootschap (Teylers First or Theological Society), and after the death of his father in 1858 he would succeed him as director at the Teylers Stichting (Teylers Foundation). In 1844 he joined the Algemeene Doopsgezinde Soci√´teit (General Mennonite Society) of which he would become chairman of the board in 1849/1850 and 1857/1858.Sybrandi family in GAMEO He was also a member of the Maatschappij van Nederlandsche Letterkunde (Society of Dutch Literature) in Leiden. Sybrandi retired in 1871 (although he feared modernist successors) and died in 1872. He married the daughter of Mennonite minister Nicolaas Swart, but they did not have any children.

Shree Pundalik was produced and directed by Dadasaheb Torne alias Rama Chandra Gopal. History Pundalik was a silent film without dialogue. Torne and his colleagues Nanasaheb Chitre and Ramrao Kirtikar wrote the shooting script. Shree Pundalik was sent overseas for processing by Dadasaheb Torne. Torne's Pundalik was about 1,500 feet or about 22 minutes long. The film had a shooting script, was shot with a camera, and its negatives were sent to London for processing. Positives were produced and finally released at Coronation Cinematograph, Girgaum. The film ran for two weeks. Debates about the film Some have argued that Pundalik does not deserve the honour of being called the first Indian film because it was a photographic recording of a popular Marathi play, and because the cameraman‚Äîa man named Johnson‚Äîwas a British national and the film was processed in London. Detractors argue that Dadasaheb Phalke‚Äôs Raja Harishchandra, which was released nearly a year later, is more deserving of the title of the first Indian film. However, other writers, film critics and historians like Firoze Rangoonwalla, Arnab Jan Deka, Sanjit Narwekar have argued that Dadasaheb Torne was indeed the father of Indian cinema, as his first directed and produced feature film Pundalik was officially released on 18 May 1912, almost one year before Phalke's Raja Harischandra, released on 3 May 1913.

The Archives' building is located in Senjak, which belongs to a designated cultural-historical area of Topƒçider, famous for its numerous public and private buildings assigned monument status. It is the most important archive and museum of the history of Yugoslavia. History The Archives of the Yugoslav state were founded in 1950, under the name State Archive of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FNRJ). Three years later the name was changed to The State Archives of FNRJ, and in 1964, to The Archives of Yugoslavia. It retained this name until 2003, when, as a consequence of the creation of a State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, it was renamed The Archives of Serbia and Montenegro. In 2009, the Serbian government reinstated its previous name and granted it the status of high cultural importance. Archives and collections Within its 840 archives and collections, The Archives of Yugoslavia house 24.5 kilometers of records created between 1914 and 2006. The materials relate to the activities of the central government and state authorities in the areas of the domestic and foreign policy, finance, economy, healthcare, education, culture, social policy, justice, banking, and other topics. Archival records from the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia comprise 146 archives of materials created between 1918 and 1945. The archival materials of the post-war Yugoslavia comprise 633 archives generated in the period between 1945 and 2006.

Vojin Petrovic designed the impressive three-story building in the Modernist style. Its use changed with the beginning of the Second World War and the occupation, during which it housed the Headquarters of the Gestapo, as well as a section of the German military command for the South- West. After the war the building housed the Communist Party and a police school.

The method is based on the minimization of a least squares functional, defined as the weighted summation of the squared residual of the governing differential equation and its boundary conditions at nodal points used to discretize the domain and its boundaries. While most of the existing meshless methods need background cells for numerical integration, DLSM did not require a numerical integration procedure due to the use of the discrete least squares method to discretize the governing differential equation. A Moving least squares (MLS) approximation method is used to construct the shape function, making the approach a fully least squares-based approach. Arzani and AfsharH. Arzani, M.H. Afshar, Solving Poisson‚Äôs equation by the discrete least square meshless method, WIT Transactions on Modelling and Simulation 42 (2006) 23‚Äì31. developed the DLSM method in 2006 for the solution of Poisson's equation.

The method can be considered as an extension the earlier method of DLSM by the introduction of a set of collocation points for the calculation of the least squares functional. CDLSM was later used by Naisipour et al.M. Naisipour, M. H. Afshar, B. Hassani, A.R. Firoozjaee, Collocation Discrete Least Square (CDLS) Method for Elasticity Problems.

In this approach, the differential equations governing the planar elasticity problems are written in terms of the stresses and displacements which are approximated independently using the same shape functions. Since the resulting governing equations are of the first order, both the displacement and stress boundary conditions are of the Dirichlet type, which is easily incorporated via a penalty method. Because this is a least squares based algorithm of the MDLSM method, the proposed method does not need to be satisfied by the Ladyzhenskaya‚ÄìBabu≈°ka‚ÄìBrezzi (LBB) condition.

They sell their car to acquire a nearby filling station. Taking turns at serving as petrol attendants the three independently of one another fall in love with the handsome and well-off customer Lilian, anxiously hiding their romance with each other.

It was the subject of Australia's first substantial strategic policy initiative, when in 1888 Alfred Deakin took his concerns about French intrusion into Vanuatu to London (Wainwright 2003: 13). Since then, the South Pacific has played an important role in Australian security thinking. Notably during the Second World War in the Pacific and through Australia's responsibilities as a colonial power in Papua New Guinea until that country's independence in 1975. Australia was regarded as having been quite detached from the Pacific Islands during the post colonial period (Wainwright & White 2004: 10). However this period, until the beginning of the 21st century, was marked by numerous small scale Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations in the region. The notable cases were in Vanuatu in 1980 and 1988 as well Fiji in 1987 (Breen 2008: 44‚Äì45). The ADF also played an important role in peacekeeping missions in Bougainville during this period.  Strategic outlook  Australia has always placed an important emphasis on security in the South Pacific because of the concern that Australia's security could be undermined by anarchy in these states, or by them falling under the control of potentially hostile governments (Wainwright & White 2004: 14). Currently these perceptions translate into ongoing defence, security, economic, aid, environmental and humanitarian activities (Firth 2008: 1). = Defence White Papers 2000 and 2009 = The security of Australia's immediate neighbourhood which it shares with Indonesia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and the island countries of the South Pacific has ubiquitously been listed as the second most important defence priority behind the ability to defend Australia from a direct military attack (Australian Government Department of Defence 2000 & 2009). The White Papers emphasise that unstable neighbours could lead to a strategic environment that might be inimical to Australia's interests (Australian Government Department of Defence 2000 & 2009). = Expectations of Australia = Australia considers itself as having significant responsibilities as a leader and regional power to ensure a stable and secure South Pacific (Australian Government Department of Defence 2000: 43‚Äì44). Australia is also expected by its global partners to be a regional leader and is judged by how well it fulfils this role (Firth 2008: 1; Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 1997: 65). In this role as a regional leader, Australia has assumed a role as the de facto security guarantor across the Melanesian Arc (Dobell 2011: 1 & 6). In addition, Australia realises that while the problems in its neighbourhood may not be 'world shaping problems', however, if it does not take the lead in addressing regional issues someone else might and this would be detrimental to Australia's ability to influence the region (Lyon 2008: 2). = The Arc of Instability = The term ‚ÄòArc of Instability‚Äô is commonly used to refer to the region to Australia's immediate North and East and it is a term that has appeared in numerous Australian Government reports (Rumley 2006: 17). Australian Government fears were that the failing states in the South Pacific, unable to uphold the rule of law or control their borders, could make Australia more vulnerable to transnational criminal operations and perhaps terrorism (Wainwright 2003: 13‚Äì14). In 2003, the then Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, directly alluded to the possibility of the unstable situation in Solomon Islands posing 'insidious and direct threats to Australia' and spoke about the possibility of intervention (Downer 2003). There was also concern that events in one part of the 'Arc of Instability' could be contagious for regional neighbours (Wainwright & White 2004: 14). The importance that Australia places on a secure immediate neighbourhood, is demonstrated by the inclusion in this strategy of the protection of Timor Leste, political stability in Melanesia (including maintenance of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)) and close defence ties with Papua New Guinea (Bergin & Herr 2011: 32). Australia is cognizant that ‚Äònon- conventional‚Äô security threats pose problems not only to the islands but the threat that they pose a threat to 'Australia through the region' (Bergin & Herr 2011: 32). While transnational, ‚Äònon-conventional‚Äô security threats are the main security concern for Australia pertaining to the South Pacific, Australian defence and security strategists have considered the possibility of weak states in the South Pacific becoming bases from which hostile powers could launch conventional military attacks on Australia (Lyon 2007: 9; Wainwright 2003: 15).  Regional intervention  = Regional Assistance Mission Solomon Islands (RAMSI) = A June 2000 coup in the Solomon Islands led to the formation of an Australian led International Peace Monitoring Team (IPMT) to support efforts to preserve peace between warring ethnic groups. The IPMT ‚Äì which included Defence (civilian and military) participation ‚Äì helped oversee an end to inter-ethnic conflict and withdrew in June 2002 (Australian Government Department of Defence 2003: 21). After persistent pleas from the Solomon Island Government for Australian intervention, following a renewal of inter-ethnic conflict, Australia brought Pacific Forum Foreign Ministers to Sydney and said it would lead a regional intervention force, RAMSI. This was backed by the Pacific Islands Forum‚Äôs Biketawa declaration of 2000, authorising regional action in the case of security crises arising in member countries (Firth 2008: 10). In 2003, the then Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, emphasised that intervention into Solomon Islands was in Australia's national interest because failed states in the region could become safe havens for transnational criminals and terrorists (Breen 2008: 50). Perceptions that the Solomon Islands was on the brink of becoming a failed state, and the threat that this could pose for Australia's national interests, provided the primary rationale for the Australian led intervention (Allen 2011: 4). This rationale was heavily influenced by broader shifts in the international strategic environment following the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the subsequent US led war on terror (Allen 2011: 4). The decision to launch the RAMSI initiative in 2003 marked a sharp departure from the policy paradigm of detachment which had shaped Australia's approach to its Pacific Island neighbours in the post colonial period (Wainwright & White 2004: 10). On 24 July 2003, the first RAMSI personnel were deployed to Solomon Islands. Personnel numbers peaked at about 2250 in September /October 2003, comprising 1800 military (1500 of which were ADF personnel), 300 police, and civilian advisers (Fullilove 2006: 8). The military component was drawn down from late October 2003 in the wake of early successes in restoring security (Fullilove 2006: 8). The Howard government redeployed troops to Solomon Islands in response to renewed unrest in Honiara in 2006 (Ayson 2007: 216). In 2006 Australia also worked with RAMSI partner New Zealand to deploy police and military personnel to assist the Tongan government's efforts to ensure security after riots in Nukualofa (Ayson 2007: 216). The police component, known as the Participating Police Force (PPF), has remained relatively constant in size, with the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service contributing about half its numbers, supplemented by officers from the Pacific states of New Zealand, PNG, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, Nauru, Samoa, Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Cook Islands (Fullilove 2006 :8). The civilian element works in both line and advisory positions in Solomon Islands government agencies (Fullilove 2006: 8). RAMSI's mission is to assist the Government of Solomon Islands in the maintenance of security, law and justice, economic governance and improving the machinery of government (Australian Government Department of Defence n.d.a). The main task for the military component is to be prepared to respond to incidents beyond the capabilities of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) and RAMSI's multi-national Participating Police Force (Australian Government Department of Defence n.d.a). As of April 2012, initial talks began to determine a timetable for the withdrawal of the multinational military component of RAMSI, whilst maintaining the presence of the PPF (Radio Australia 2012).  Maritime security  Australia has several objectives in promoting regional maritime security. At a strategic level, it's about provisions of assistance to the Pacific Island states to promote influence in the region (Bateman & Bergin 2008: 56). A second objective is to assist in building a more stable regional environment that will prevent threats from arising from the region that are inimical to Australia's interests (Bateman & Bergin 2008: 56). = The Pacific Patrol Boat Project (PPBP) = The Pacific Patrol Boat Project is said to be \\"the cornerstones of Australia's strategic influence in the region\\" (Bergin 2011:1). The project commenced in 1985 and twenty-two Pacific Class patrol boats have now been donated to twelve recipient countries (Bateman & Bergin 2008: 62). Through the PPBP, Australia provides financial, technical, logistics, maintenance, training and other support to 19 patrol boats across 11 Pacific Island countries (not including the three boats given to Fiji). Defence's support is underpinned by 25 Royal Australian Navy maritime surveillance and technical advisers located across the Pacific‚Äô (Australian Government Department of Defence 2011: 247). The PPBP, supported by other measures designed to assist in the development of maritime security capacity, has been the feature of the Department of Defence's cooperation in the South Pacific. Australia's aim through these projects is to assists its neighbours 'to develop the capacity to protect their maritime resources and enforce sovereignty' (Australian Department of Defence 2009: 98). In 2010‚Äì11, the last patrol boat commenced a refit as part of the Defence-sponsored Life Extension Program which extends the life of the boats from 15 to 30 years. This program provides deep level maintenance to take the vessels through to their end of service life (Australian Department of Defence 2011: 247). = The Pacific Maritime Security Project (PMSP) = At the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in August 2009, the Australian Government announced it would undertake an assessment, in consultation with Pacific Island countries, of a new maritime security program to follow the PPBP (Australian Government Customs and Border Protection Service 2011: 107). The goal of the PMSP is to 'develop a more integrated maritime security system that builds on the successes of the past to effectively and efficiently meet the challenges of managing the Pacific maritime domain' (Australian Government Customs and Border Protection Service 2011: 107). The PMSP was originally slated to be overseen by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service but the responsibility for the program has recently been passed to the Department of Defence (Australian Government Department of Defence 2012). = Maritime surveillance = In addition to the PPBP, Australia makes other contributions to maritime surveillance and enforcement in the South Pacific. In 2009‚Äì2010, Australia supported seven successful regional maritime surveillance activities in the area (Bergin 2011: 2). Operation Solania, the ADF contribution to airborne maritime surveillance in the South Pacific, provides intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to the Pacific Island countries (Australian Government Department of Defence n.d.b). The ADF contribution through Operation Solania is part of a wider maritime surveillance initiative with Australia's security partners in the region (the United States, New Zealand and France) through the regular Quadrilateral Defence Coordinating Group Talks (Bergin 2011: 2).  Regional security cooperation  = Bi- lateral cooperation = Australia's bi-lateral security engagement with the island states of the South Pacific is predominantly based around the Defence Cooperation Program (DCP) which has a broad goal of 'enhancing the defence related capabilities of regional partner nations' (Australian Government Department of Defence 2011: 246). The DCP includes a provision of ADF advisers, training initiatives and bi-lateral exercises, capacity building initiatives, and equipment and infrastructure projects (Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability 2009). One of the preeminent DCP projects is the PPBP. Australia does not have any bilateral defence ties with Fiji, having suspended all defence activities with Fiji following the 2006 Fijian military attempt to overthrow the elected government, and is yet to reinstate them (Hufbauer et al. 2012: 9).  Multilateral cooperation  The main body through which Australia is involved in multilateral regional cooperation in the South Pacific is through the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Australia is one of fifteen regional countries that are members of the organisation, with Fiji having been suspended since 2009 as a result of continuing martial law rule and human rights violations (Hiebert & Shearer 2012: 2). The PIF has taken 'an important lead in authenticating a regional approach by claiming a general policy mandate for security' (Bergin & Herr 2011: 36). Four PIF declarations provide a mandate for law enforcement and security initiatives: * -1992 Honiara Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation. * -1997 Aitutaki Declaration on Regional Security Cooperation * -2000 Biketawa Declaration * -2002 Nasonini Declaration on Regional Security (Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat n.d.) The 2005 Pacific Plan has built on this mandate by incorporating security as one of its four pillars alongside economic growth, sustainable development and good governance (Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat 2007: 2). The PIF Secretariat has taken on some administrative responsibility for implementing these initiatives, most notably through the establishment of the Forum Regional Security Committee to undertake security assessments and facilitate information and intelligence sharing (Bergin & Herr 2011: 36). Australia is also engaged multilaterally with regional states through their participation in RAMSI and is engaged multilaterally with regional security partners through the Quadrilateral Defence Coordinating Group Talks.  Future of the relationship  Australia has made a commitment to continue its security relationship with the region with continued engagement through the development of the PMSP to follow on from the PPBP. With talks pertaining to the withdrawal of the military component of RAMSI underway, the nature of the ADF's presence in the South Pacific will change. Sometime between 2015 and 2020, Bougainville will vote on whether to secede from Papua New Guinea. Australia will likely play a role in the aftermath of the vote, no matter what the outcome is, this may include ADF intervention (Dobell 2011: 2).

He has achieved five world records in ocean rowing. In 2010 he - together with three other rowers successfully crossed the North Atlantic Ocean in a rowing boat, breaking a 114-year-old record. In January 2013 he went on another journey, this time the plan was to cross the South Atlantic Ocean with a boat called Avalon, the crew was eight men, they started on 18 January from Puerto de Mog√°n, Grand Canaria, their plan was to row to Port Saint Charles, Barbados. They made it all the way to Barbados on 22 February 2013 after rowing for 32 days, 12 hours and 41 minutes. Later the same year Nysted went on another expedition together with two other men. Their journey started in Australia on 9 June 2013. They crossed the Indian Ocean by rowing. They arrived at Mauritius on 5 August 2013 after rowing for 57 days, 15 hours and 49 minutes, which was a new world record. Livar sat three world records after completing this journey: he and the two others were the first crew of three to cross the Indian Ocean, they were also the fastest rowing crew to row this distance and Livar sat a new world record for having crossed two oceans in a rowing boat within the same year.Aktuelt.fo, Pr√≥gvini hj√° Livari komin fram (in Faroese)  Livar Nysted's rowing career  Growing up next to the North Atlantic Ocean in the small fishing village Hvannasund in the island Vi√∞oy, which is one of the Northern Islands in the Faroe Islands the ocean was a natural part of daily life. The national sport of the Faroe Islands is Kappr√≥√∞ur, which means boat race in wooden Faroese boats. There are different types of boats and Nysted has tried all of them. He has won several Faroese Championships in these boat races, which are held during the summertime from late May to late July, the final race is the one at the national holiday at √ìlavs√∏ka in T√≥rshavn on 28 July. = Faroese Champion in Ocean Rowing in Fjords and Sounds (Kappr√≥√∞ur) = Kappr√≥√∞ur at J√≥ans√∏ka 2010, 10-mannaf√∏r.

The boat was called Nor√∞oyingur, which means a person who comes from the Northern Islands (Nor√∞oyggjar) in the Faroes. They got bad weather and had to give up after 24 hours. Two years later in 2005 he tried again this time with another crew and another boat, which was called Havrenningur. They almost made it, they saw the coast of the Shetland Islands, but they were more or less ordered to give up, because of bad weather, and so they did. Their trip ended after 6 days, and they were only 18 miles from the shore. A boat from the Shetland Coast Guard dragged them to land.Trip.fo, about the trip to the Shetland Islands in 2005. = La Mondiale in 2009 = In 2009 Livar Nysted was one of the crew members of La Mondiale, which made an attempt to cross the South Atlantic Ocean, it was a speed record attempt.

History The first known feudal seigneur was living in 1050. Following the execution of the owner, Henri de Ruz√© d'Effiat, Grand √âcuyer (squire) and favourite of the King, in 1642 the fortress was rased by order of Cardinal Richelieu. The 15th century guard house, whose fa√ßades were modified in the 18th and 19th centuries, developed between two round towers; the northern tower has an attached staircase tower. The fortress is surrounded by moats, rebuilt in the 16th century. The drawbridge was replaced by a fixed three-arched bridge. Of the four towers linked to the buildings or the curtain wall, only the East Tower, the South Tower (13th century) and the base of the North Tower (the end-of-12th century keep) remain. The upper floors have been destroyed. The towers are crowned with a modern fantasy crenelation. A triangular construction, called the Eperon, extends from the south east of the fortress. The salient angle is occupied by a bartizan. It was constructed or remodelled in the 16th century, at the same time as the moats. In the corresponding corner of the wall above the moat is a cylindrical tower dating from the 15th century which contained a stone spiral staircase which allowed the lords to descend from the castle to the priory joined to the church. The castle is privately owned. It has been listed since 1976 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

It is given by: g_{0} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2 {k_B}^2 T}{3h} \\\\approx (9.464\\\\times10^{-13} {\\\\rm W/K}^{2})T. The thermal conductance of any electrically insulating structure that exhibits ballistic phonon transport is a positive integer multiple of g_0. The thermal conductance quantum was first measured in 2000. These measurements employed suspended silicon nitride nanostructures that exhibited a constant thermal conductance of 16g_0 at temperatures below approximately 0.6 kelvin. For ballistic electrical conductors, the electron contribution to the thermal conductance is also quantized as a result of the electrical conductance quantum and the Wiedemann‚ÄìFranz law, which has been quantitatively measured at both cryogenic (~20 mK) and room temperature (~300K). The thermal conductance quantum, also called quantized thermal conductance, may be understood from the Wiedemann- Franz law, which shows that {\\\\kappa \\\\over \\\\sigma} = LT, where L is a universal constant called the Lorenz factor, L = {\\\\pi^2 k_B^2 \\\\over 3e^2}.

The genus currently comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies on the surface of infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species. There are four described species in the Amylostereaceae: A. chailletii (the type), A. areolatum, A. ferreum and A. laevigatum. The species were initially considered part of Stereum until mycologist Jacques Boidin found atypical microscopic differences between them. Forty years after his extensive researches from 1958, Boidin reclassified Amylostereum into its own family. Three Amylostereum species are symbionts of wood wasps in the genera Sirex, Urocerus, and Xoanon, which infest conifers. The female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees, and the fungus is eaten by the wasp's larva as food. The fungus propagates vegetatively through the formation of asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi. The A. areolatum‚ÄìSirex woodwasp (S. noctilio) symbiont complex has been studied extensively because of its potential to cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry, particularly in non-native regions. Taxonomy and history of research Amylostereaceae species were for a long time classified in the genus Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of the genus (today called A. chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose the genus name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores. Based on DNA analysis, Boidin in 1998 moved Amylostereum into a new, monotypic family, the Amylostereaceae, which he attributed to the Hericiales order. Later studies, however, supported the initial classification in the Russulales. =Classification= The classification of the Amylostereaceae is not completely resolved. The next closest relatives might be ‚Äì depending on the research ‚Äì either Echinodontium tinctorium and most other species of the genus Echinodontium, or Artomyces pyxidatus. Most of the previous DNA analysis results suggest a narrow relation to Echinodontium, but several results of studies partially contradict this conclusion. Only the classification to the Russulales is regarded as correct. Some authors have suggested that Amylostereum should be placed in the family Echinodontiaceae. The similarities between A. chailletii and A. areolatum have caused some confusion regarding their placement in the genus. As only the size of their fruit bodies differ from each other in appearance, researcher German Josef Krieglsteiner assumed that both are the same species in different age stages. Experiments with pure cultures of the fungi, however, showed that the mycelia of A. chailletii, A. laevigatum and A. ferreum were partially compatible to each other, but the mycelium of A. areolatum was incompatible to other species. Boidin believes that the common ancestor of all Amylostereum fungi used yellowwoods as a host. This genus of conifers was native in Europe until the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 million to 2.6 million years ago), but became extinct there, so the Amylostereum fungi specialized on other conifers and differentiated into several species. Only A. ferreum specialized on yellowwoods in South America. Compatibility tests as well as molecular analysis indicated that A. areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later from each other and are thus partially compatible to each other. A. ferreum and A. laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A. ferreum and A. chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A. laevigatum and A. ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A. laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A. laevigatum. As A. areolatum and A. chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low. Description =Macroscopic= The Amylostereaceae produce crust-like, dry and leathery-corky fruit bodies on the bark of infested trees. The fruit bodies are thick, irregularly shaped and are able to cover a large surface on the bark or otherwise can appear as small spots. They lie directly on the bark. The ochrous, grey or brownish fruit body (hymenium) has a smooth to warty surface texture and is turned outwards. It is bordered by a highly bent and wavy (effuso-reflex) edge on all species except A. laevigatum, which has a churlish surface (a tomentum) and is usually dirty-brown coloured. In some species, the tomentum stands clearly above and forms a kind of roof above the fruit body; if it completely surrounds this roof, there might appear cuplike shapes. =Microscopic= The Amylostereaceae possess a dimitic trama, meaning that there are in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first type is brownish skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote the growth of the fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top. With the exception of A. laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the hymenium and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi (on a broader front) and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A. laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark. The basidia are 15‚Äì25 √ó 3.5‚Äì5.5 ¬µm and have a slim, club-like shape. Each basidium features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name. Distribution The range of the Amylostereaceae originally comprised only Holarctic regions, including North America and Eurasia, and the Neotropics, with Central and South America. The introduction of A. areolatum and its symbionts, the Sirex woodwasps, saw the spread of the genus to all continents except Antarctica. Amylostereum chailletiiz is common in the temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. A. laevigatum can be also found in temperate Eurasia, but it is unclear how broadly this species is distributed in North America. A. areolatum is originally native in North Africa and Eurasia; it was however distributed through the 20th century in Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa as well as in South and North America. Only A. ferreum is originally native in the tropics and is common in Brazil and the Caribbean. Ecology Amylostereum laevigatum on fallen juniper Amylostereaceae usually infest only dead or cut down conifer wood. Three species ‚Äì A. areolatum, A. laevigatum and A. chailletii ‚Äì may also establish a symbiosis with wood wasps (Siricidae), which beside freshly logged trees also infest living trees and infect them with fungi. Symbioses have been recorded with several species: Sirex noctilio, S. juvencus, S. nitobei, S. cyaneus, S. edwarsii, S. nitidus, and, in Japan, Urocerus antennatus and Xoanon matsumurae. Wasps of the genera Sirex and Urocerus store oidia (the hypha of fungi split up to spores) in special abdominal organs. The wood wasps infect trees by splashing a phytotoxic secretion below the bark and at the same time injecting fungal spores into the hole. The secretion weakens the tree and temporarily diminishes its immune system, whereby the fungus can spread along the xylem. The infection with Amylostereaceae fulfill two functions for the wasps: it provides the larvae food, because the white rot softens the wood; at the same time, the mycelia of the fungi serves as food for the larvae. After the larvae pupate, it absorbs the mycelia of the Amylostereaceae into its body to oviposit together with its eggs. The fungus benefits from the symbiosis as it spreads faster and more effectively than through airborne spores and furthermore does not need to develop fruit bodies. A. ferreum is the only Amylosterum species that has not been associated with any woodwasps. =Host spectrum= Red-streakiness and wood wasp larvae in pinewood, infested by A. areolatum The host spectrum of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A. chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A. areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species is more common in pines on other locations. The host spectrum of A. laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A. ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus). =Symptoms of infestation= The Amylostereaceae are white rot pathogens. They disintegrate the lignin of the host wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner‚Äîwood wasps‚Äîinclude circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles. Ecological and economical importance A pine infested with A. areolatum and the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio) In their native habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor importance as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, compared with other pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not play a part in the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A. areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S. noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex‚ÄìAmylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years. As a countermeasure, cultures of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola have been used as biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A. areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S. noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex‚ÄìAmylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%‚Äì100% have been achieved.

History PTI started as a holding company for Ilwaco Telephone and Telegraph. Norman Howerton sought to upgrade the telephone equipment that Ilwaco Telephone had been using. To build capital, he organized Telephone Utilities to attract investors and modernize his telephone network. As customers began to join IT&T;, the company began to expand. In 1966, Telephone Utilities acquired its first company, Gem State Utilities of Idaho. By 1972, it acquired 22 companies that provided telephone service to 60,000 customers in four states. Telephone Utilities also began to consolidate management of its telephone operations into semi-autonomous districts to allow for greater efficiency. In 1973, Telephone Utilities was acquired by Pacific Power and Light Company of Portland, Oregon. PP&L; already owned telephone companies located in Montana and Oregon serving 40,000 customers through its Northwestern Telephone Systems. PP&L;'s existing telephone operations were placed under control of Telephone Utilities. It continued to grow and acquire small telephone companies and, in the process, upgrading switching facilities. Electronic switching was introduced in Kalispell, Montana in 1975. In 1979, 14 separate telephone companies that Telephone Utilities acquired were merged into Telephone Utilities of Washington. In 1979, Pacific Power and Light acquired Alascom from RCA. In 1982, Pacific Power and Light placed the two companies into one company called Pacific Telecom, Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, Washington. Pacific Power and Light became PacifiCorp. Throughout the 1980s, the company diversified into other fields, including cellular telephony, and then laid a Pacific cable to Japan. Beginning in 1993, U S WEST Communications, a Bell Operating Company, began selling some of its telephone lines to Pacific Telecom.

Municipal elections in Israel are elections in which the residents of the cities and local councils in Israel vote for the chairman of the local authority (mayor or municipality chairman), as well as for members of the city councils or the local councils. From 1950 to 1973, local elections were held the same day as national elections. The mayors of jurisdictions were elected by city or local councils and from among its members. This maintained party stability. In 1975, the government changed the schedule for municipal elections to every five years, rather than on the same schedule as the national legislative elections. The intention was to strengthen local politics, but the change in election day appears to have contributed to decreasing participation in voting on the local level, especially in large cities.Dana Blander, \\"Elections for the Local Authority ‚Äì Who, What, When, Where and How?\\", first published in Parliament, 05 November 2008, posted at Israel Democracy Institute; accessed 21 August 2018 In 1978 another reform established a double ballot: for the first time voters could vote directly for the mayor (by popular vote) and for a party list for seats on the city or local council. The Knesset established that a candidate needs at least 40% of the total votes order to be elected to the position of the chairman or mayor of the local authority. If no candidate gets 40% of the votes, a second round of elections is held. In this run-off, only the top two candidates compete against each other. According to the Local Authorities Elections Law (◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊î◊ë◊ó◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ú◊®◊©◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊î◊û◊ß◊ï◊û◊ô◊ï◊™), both Israeli citizens and permanent residents who are not citizens (e.g. the Palestinians of East Jerusalem), are eligible to vote for their local authorities. (In national elections, however, only Israeli citizens may vote.) Persons are considered eligible to vote in municipal elections at the age of 17 years or older. (In national elections, by contrast, citizens must be aged 18 or older to vote). The contenders in the municipal elections are mostly representatives of the parties who also compete in the legislative elections. In addition, there may be numerous candidates who are not affiliated with a major political party. At times voters will elected split tickets: a mayor who is independent or from one party, and a list of candidates for city council who are from another party. The municipal elections day is classified as a sabbatical for workers who reside within the voting area. \\\\- blog in English. - the relevant law change, Hebrew No media campaigns are broadcast on television or radio prior to the election day. Some municipalities do not hold elections in every cycle.

For example, in 2008, municipal elections were not held in Bnei Brak and in Modi'in Illit for this reason.

His father was Charles Haslam, an old Nelsonian. Early in his life, the family moved to Wellington where his father found work as a supervisor in the Hannah and Company's boot factory.Colonist, 15 December 1914 He was educated at Mt. Cook Boys‚Äô School and later Newtown School before beginning his training into the Wesleyan Church ministry. He moved to Auckland to continue his training for the ministry and attended Auckland University College graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1900.Auckland Star, 16 April 1900 Haslam served out his probationary years in Wellington until stationed to Christchurch. He married Florence Elizabeth Hurlstone in 1904, had two children: Eric Haslam and Gladys Hayman (n√©e Haslam), and worked as a Methodist church minister stationed in many areas of New Zealand (including Christchurch, Temuka, Whanganui, Canterbury, Bunnythorpe (1913‚Äì17), Palmerston North, Invercargill, Waimate (1926-1929), Nelson, Auckland, Hamilton, Otago and Wellington) rising to distinction in the Methodist Church as Secretary and later President of Conference. Haslam was also a Methodist marriage celebrant. As a young man, Haslam played cricket for the Wesley Cricket Club in Wellington.The Evening Post, 27 September 1895 He enjoyed other sports such as tennis and continued to play at cricket matches organised by delegates to Methodist conferences. One of these matches between a Wednesday Association and a Clergyman's Eleven was played at the Basin Reserve.The Evening Post, 15 February 1913 He was also a member of the Savage Club and the Masonic Lodge and played music.

Literary output  Haslam wrote verse from a young age. He became a member of the Wesleyan Literary and Debating Society in the early-mid 1890s, did acting for them, and edited their journal, which also printed some of his early poems.The Evening Post, 10 May 1895 In 1903, his poem ‚ÄòA Bike Race‚Äô appeared in the Canterbury College Review while he was living there.Scenes in Southland (London: The Epworth Press, 1926) One book of his poetry, Scenes in Southland, appeared in London published by The Epworth Press in 1926. (This volume collects much of his poetry dating back to the 1890s.) He is chiefly a sonneteer working over spiritual themes and the universal subjects of love and death. Other topics include war and literature, and his book contains a section of lighter verse possibly written in his younger years. Some poems certainly date back to his student years in Auckland.

Site description The site consists of a high and wide platform mound, with a large associated village surrounded by a palisade. It was occupied by Dallas Phase peoples of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture between 1200 and 1500 CE.Tennessee Historical Commission Marker, \\"McMahan Indian Mound,\\" in Sevierville, Tennessee. Information accessed 3 September 2007. At the time it was first investigated scientifically in 1881 the mound was located on a farm owned by the McMahan family for whom it is now named. Excavations Birdman gorget from Hixon Site similar to one found at McMahan Excavations by William H. Holmes in 1881 unearthed burials, arrow-points, a marble pipe, Mississippian culture pottery, and numerous engraved shell gorgets and columnella pendants. Several items of European manufacture were found in the excavations, including brass pins and cylindrical glass beads, implying that the mound site had been inhabited during the time of European contact in the American Southeast. One fragmentary engraved shell gorget found during the excavations was particularly noteworthy. It depicts two S.E.C.C. \\"Birdmen\\" with wings and talons for feet grasping each other by the neck with one hand and wielding ceremonial flint blades with the other. This type of gorget is carved in what is now known as the Hightower style. Holmes also uncovered several \\"rattlesnake\\" and mask style gorgets as well as a curious gorget with looping lines that Holmes described as \\"very interesting object.....The figure is so obscure that considerable study is necessary in making it out.\\" These pieces are in the styles now known as the Lick Creek style and Citico style for the rattlesnake gorgets, Chickamauga style for the mask-like gorgets and Williams Island or Spaghetti style for the last.

The book, which deals with death and the afterlife, has been translated into various languages, including Dutch and English, and was adapted in animated and movie format. Synopsis The story involves a duck who acquaints a character called Death who, as it turns out, has been following her all her life. The two become friends, discussing life, death, and what any afterlife might be like. They go diving together and sit in a tree, pondering what would happen to the duck's lake after her death. The duck reports that some ducks say that they become angels and sit on clouds, looking down on earth. Death says that this is possible since ducks already have wings. Then, she says that some ducks also say that there is a hell, down below, where bad ducks are roasted; Death replies that it's remarkable what ducks all think of, and says \\"who knows,\\" prompting the duck to respond, \\"so you don't know either.\\" In the end, the duck indeed dies, and Death carries her to a river, placing the duck gently in the water and laying the tulip on her: \\"For a long time he watched her. When she was lost to sight, he was almost a little moved.\\" Critical reception The book was nominated for the 2008 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis; the jury praised Erlbruch's \\"soft-philosophical Pas de deux\\" and his sparse illustrations: \\"the radical reduction of the images underlines the dramatic subject matter in a fulminant manner.\\" Meg Rosoff, in a review for The Guardian, called Duck, Death and the Tulip an \\"outstanding book\\": \\"There is something infinitely tender in the way Death strokes her ruffled feathers into place, lifts her body and places it gently in the river, watching as she drifts off into the distance.\\" Sieglinde Duchateau, in a review of the Dutch translation, also praised the book: \\"The atmosphere is warm, intimate, and full of comfort. In the masterpiece a difficult theme is made accessible for children in an idiosyncratic manner with a touch of humor.\\" For his illustrations, Erlbruch received honorable mention in the 2008 Dutch Gouden Penseel competition for best children's book illustrations. Adaptations An animated adaptation was directed by Matthias Bruhn; Death was voiced by Harry Rowohlt, Duck by Anna Thalbach. The film was nominated for the 2010 Cartoon d'or, and won the 2010 Animated Film Award at the SCHLINGEL International Film Festival. It opened the 2010 Lucas Filmfestival for children's films, and aired on the German television show Die Sendung mit der Maus. In 2011, director Andrea Simon released a short film of the same name; in her version, two young sisters cope with the death of their mother by reading the book.

Early life Born in Melbourne on 2 February 1913, after attending St Kevin's College Callinan completed a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at the University of Melbourne. Upon graduating in 1935, he joined the embryonic consulting practice of Gordon Gutteridge, which became Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey a few years later and is now known as GHD. Military service Callinan was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force in June 1940, being appointed into the Royal Australian Engineers. In March 1941, he volunteered for overseas service and joined the Second Australian Imperial Force, taking up a posting as an instructor at the Demolitions Wing, at the 7th Infantry Training Centre. He was promoted to captain in July 1941, and subsequently posted as the second-in-command to the 2/2nd Independent Company, deploying with them to Timor as part of Sparrow Force in December 1941. He subsequently led the commandos during their campaign on the island and in July 1942 was temporarily promoted to major. Upon returning to Australia, his promotion to major was confirmed and he served on the headquarters of the First Army as a staff officer before taking up a posting as second-in-command of the 31st/51st Battalion at Merauke in November 1943. In early 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 26th Battalion, leading them through the Bougainville Campaign. In February 1946, he was discharged from the 2nd AIF, but later returned to the Citizen Military Forces and commanded the 58/32 Infantry Battalion, commanding it from 1948 to 1951. For his wartime service he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross for outstanding leadership and gallantry. He was also Mentioned in Despatches. Professional career Returning to GHD from service in World War 2, Callinan developed the practice in Victoria and Tasmania, creating a vibrant and enthusiastic team with a reputation for efficiency and integrity. Callinan was a great believer in diversifying the scope of work that GHD performed, particularly in urban planning. He studied this subject at Melbourne University part-time and topped his class with honours. This enabled GHD to add another service to its offering and grow its relationships with local government clients. He was appointed chairman and managing director of the company in 1971 and received a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to engineering. The following year he was presented with the Peter Nicol Russell Memorial Medal from the Institution of Engineers Australia. In 1977 he was knighted for services to engineering and retired from GHD in 1978, after 44 years of service. Callinan led the company through a period of rapid expansion, as it grew to 500 employees with offices around Australia and began to establish a global footprint. Callinan held many positions in the commercial field, including director of CSR Ltd, director of British Petroleum Company of Australia, chairman of the new Federal Parliament House Construction Authority, commissioner of the Australia Broadcasting Corporation and the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SEC), deputy chancellor of LaTrobe University and president of the Institute of Engineers Australia. From 1963 he served as Commissioner of the SEC Victoria. Sport administration Callinan joined the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) committee in 1966 and served as president from 1980 to 1985. He fought to retain the Victorian Football League (VFL) grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and was a long-serving Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) Patron-in-Chief. Later life He died in 1995. His five children and his wife, Naomi, survived him. Notes External links * Bernard Callinan's publications. * .

The street was formerly known as \\"Viale di Porta Garibaldi\\" (Porta Garibaldi Avenue),Map of Milan in 1910 and was renamed after World War I in remembrance of the fightings on the Pasubio massif (Dolomites) that occurred during the war. The buildings in Viale Pasubio were severely damaged by Allied bombings in World War II; those on the southern side of the street were never fully restored or replaced. The ruins have been adapted to diverse purposes: a large plant nursery has been established, and a number of slum-like, abusive settlements have formed (and have been cleared by the local police) over time.Sgomberata dai vigili una baraccopoli abusiva A notable building of the Viale Pasubio area is the Unilever Tower, a skyscraper built in 1962, now abandoned.

Designed and created by Norman J. Taylor between 1973 and 1975, the work was funded by TriMet and the United States Department of Transportation and was installed on the Transit Mall in 1977. The following year Kvinneakt appeared in the \\"Expose Yourself to Art\\" poster which featured future Mayor of Portland Bud Clark flashing the sculpture. It remained in place until November 2006 when it was removed temporarily during renovation of the Transit Mall and the installation of the MAX Light Rail on the mall. Originally located on Fifth Avenue, the sculpture was reinstalled on the mall in 2009 at a different location, on SW Sixth Avenue between Alder and Morrison, where it remains. According to TriMet, Kvinneakt is one of 40 public art sculptures in the Transit Mall's art collection. The sculpture is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council and is administered by the City of Portland Metropolitan Arts Commission. History Kvinneakt was designed and created by Norman J. Taylor, a Seattle-based artist and professor of sculpture at the University of Washington, between 1973 and 1975. The piece is an abstract bronze sculpture depicting a full-length nude woman measuring 71\\" x 38\\" x 25\\". Kvinneakt was one of 11 sculptures selected for the Portland Transit Mall from more than 500 entries entered in a juried competition. The works were purchased through a budget of $250,000; Kvinneakt was commissioned at a cost of $6,500. Funding sources for the project included Tri-Met (20 percent) and the United States Department of Transportation (80 percent). Of the 11 sculptures, only Kvinneakt and Kathleen McCullough's (n√©e Conchuratt) Cat in Repose were considered \\"figurative\\". Claiming his intention was not to be vulgar, Taylor said: \\"It's about grace and motion and a certain beauty and pride in the human figure. That may be sensual, but that's far different from sex.\\" According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, Taylor intended the piece to be \\"confrontational\\"; he admitted, \\"the worst reaction you could give my work is no reaction.\\" Kvinneakt was installed on the newly built Transit Mall in 1977. The bronze sculpture was sited on SW Fifth Avenue near Washington Street (between Washington and Stark). In 1978, Kvinneakt appeared on the \\"Expose Yourself to Art\\" poster, which featured future Portland Mayor Bud Clark flashing the nude woman. In 1981, about 30 minutes before the start of April Fools' Day, three men attempted to steal the statue, breaking it free from its pedestal and dragging it towards a waiting car before being spotted by a city worker and fleeing the scene. Damage from the incident included a broken right index finger and other cracks. Repairs cost $3,000 and were undertaken by Norman Taylor, who also strengthened the sculpture's body and its connections to its base. Kvinneakt was reinstalled at Fifth Avenue and Washington six months later, in October 1981. Plaque for Kvinneakt The sculpture has served as a stop on walking tours of the city, including the Metropolitan Arts Commission's 1987 Portland Public Art walking tour and the 2003 Public Art Conference's walking tour of downtown. On November 7, 2006, Kvinneakt was temporarily removed for renovation of the Transit Mall and installation of the MAX Light Rail along the mall. Its removal was supervised by staff of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. During this time Kvinneakt and other removed works were cleaned and refurbished. In September 2009, the statue was re-sited on SW Sixth Avenue between Alder and Morrison. Representatives from the Regional Arts & Culture Council and the TriMet Public Art Program conducted the unveiling. According to the former organization's public art manager, the sculpture will likely remain in its current location for as long as 30 years. There have been other instances when Kvinneakt was used to make a statement or act as a prop. On April Fools' Day, 1982, the Portland Rainmakers gathered around the sculpture, issued a proclamation condemning nudity, \\"even in statues, for viewing by the general public\\", and left the statue covered with a \\"size 42-plus\\", lacy bra. In 1984 the statue was vandalized with the painted text \\"Jesus Saves\\". In January 1985, on the day Bud Clark took the oath of office as Mayor of Portland, Kvinneakt was draped anonymously with a sash reading \\"Congratulations\\". In 2007 Tom Burkleaux, founder of New Deal Vodka, posted an image of the sculpture on the company's website with the woman's nipples airbrushed out, protesting censorship after the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau deemed the website \\"offensive\\". In 2012, Century of Action, a project of the Oregon Women's History Consortium, used the sculpture to promote women's suffrage by placing a \\"Votes for Women\\" sash across her chest as part of the organization's \\"Sash Project\\".Sources for Century of Action's Sash Project:  Reception Kvinneakt is often referred to as the most notorious of the sculptures installed in the Transit Mall during the 1970s. In addition to being somewhat controversial because it is a nude, the sculpture has also received mixed reviews as a work of art. In 1981, Taylor recalled that following the sculpture's first installation one man told him that \\"he ought to be ashamed of himself.\\" In 1985, Jeff Kuechle of The Oregonian listed the work as one of the city's \\"worst sculptures\\". In the article, Claire Kelly, director of Portland State University's art and architecture program said, \\"She's more than simplistic, she's absurd. It's not a piece that belongs on public display.\\" In contrast, Monk Magazine described the sculpture as \\"the best-looking girl in Portland\\" with \\"her stunning eyes and voluptuous figure\\".

It relates the story of one Abba, who, at the age of sixty, attracted by the fame of Moses Mendelssohn, went to Berlin to acquire secular knowledge. In his native town, Glusk, Abba was persecuted by the fanatical representatives of the orthodox Jewish community for his liberal views. He had to leave the town, and traveled from place to place as a wandering preacher (maggid). When he came to Wilna, he had thirteen works ready for publication, but on account of their radical tendencies they were burned in the courtyard of the synagogue. Probably he himself would have fared badly had not a rabbi come to his assistance. In an article published in \\"Ha-Karmel,\\" 1872, No. 5, where a Hebrew translation of Chamisso's poem is given, it is stated that Joshua Selig Salkind in his childhood witnessed the burning of the \\"Glusker maggid's\\" books, and that Elijah, the gaon of Wilna, saved him from the mob. Kayserling thinks that Abba Glusk Leczeka is a poetical presentation of Solomon Maimon's real adventures, but S. Stanislavski (in \\"Voskhod,\\" 1887, No. 12) contends that he is the Glusker Maggid.

Introduced on 22 June 2012 by producer Bryan Kirkwood, Joey is the estranged son of established character Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) and the brother of Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). Joey was featured in storylines such as a problematic relationship with his father due to his absence in his life, and a relationship with his first cousin Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). Joey and Lauren's relationship was one of the prominent storylines featured throughout 2012 and 2013. He also had relationships with Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). The character is recognised as one of the sexiest males in the show's history, and Witts won \\"Sexiest Male\\" at the Inside Soap Awards as well as being nominated again at The British Soap Awards 2013. Witts also won \\"Most Popular Newcomer\\" at the National Television Awards. In October 2013, it was announced that Witts had decided to leave the show. The door was left open for a possible return for the character, and Joey left Albert Square to live with his mother on 26 December 2013. Storylines Joey arrives in Walford to persuade his sister, Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) to return home. However, Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) is angered by Joey. He punches Derek and then reveals he is his son. He makes it clear he wants nothing to do with Derek. Later, he meets his cousin Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) and takes a liking to her friend Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater). He tricks Derek into giving him money, which he gives to Lucy, as Derek has been stealing money from her. He tries to bring Alice home but she insists she is staying, and Joey accepts work from Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) as Derek does not like Michael. He then decides to show Alice what Derek is really like, so invites several friends to a family dinner, leading to Derek trying to punch Joey. However, Alice is just angry at Joey for ruining her day. He later helps Lucy when she is being pestered by someone, and they end up kissing. Joey manages to con Derek out of more money for Lucy, and she invites him to stay with her. When Derek gains ownership of the emporium, he gives it to Joey. He later kisses Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), angering her. Joey's cousin, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), notices that Whitney is unhappy around Joey, and Joey admits that he kissed Whitney. Lauren tells Joey he needs to tell Lucy but he insists it was just a kiss. Lucy, Whitney and Lauren decide Joey needs to be taught a lesson so they get Lucy to call Joey to the park and then handcuff him to a gate and leave him, Lauren later returns and frees him but Joey says to her that she's jealous that he kissed Whitney and not her so Lauren slaps him and leaves. Joey later ends his relationship with Lucy, no longer having feelings for her. He later moves in with his uncle Max Branning (Jake Wood) much to Derek's dismay, he then begins a sexual relationship with his cousin Lauren, and they quickly fall in love, Derek finds them kissing and informs Joey, worried he will tell Max they attempt to run away, stealing Derek's car, Lauren had been drinking and crashes the car, Derek saves them, however Joey still has no feelings for him, Joey also takes the blame for the crash, but calls off his relationship with his cousin as Derek threatens to tell the police that Lauren was the real driver. Lauren's mother Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner) discovers the relationship and Derek blackmails her to force Joey to break up with Lauren. Derek dies of a heart attack, and Joey does not help him. Joey breaks down at the funeral, telling Alice it is his fault. Dot Branning (June Brown) finds Joey and Lauren making out on her sofa, and when Joey is introduced to her as Derek's son, she is horrified and reveals the relationship to the rest of the family. However, they continue their relationship with the approval of Lauren's parents. In a fit of jealousy, Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Joey breaks up with Lauren, leaving her distraught. Lauren later leaves Walford with her mother and brother to go to a clinic to get over her alcoholism. When Lauren returns, she finds out that Joey had sex with Whitney. Joey and Lauren decide to still be friends, though Joey is jealous when he finds out that Lauren is seeing another man. Joey becomes increasingly concerned about his sister Alice, and the way she is involved in a bitter custody feud between Michael and his wife Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). After Alice is imprisoned for Michael's murder, she tells Joey that she only killed Michael to stop him killing Janine. Joey tries to get Janine to change her statement to confirm this, but Janine refuses, claiming Alice is a murderer. Later Joey tells Janine that he believes her and when Joey comforts Janine over her loss this leads to them having sex. Janine ends the relationship when she realises Joey is just trying to get her to admit she killed Michael and Alice did not. Alice pleads guilty to the murder but Janine is arrested after Joey gives the police a tape recording of Janine admitting that she killed Michael. Joey speaks to Alice's solicitor, who confirms she will not be released because of her plea. Having nothing to stay for, Joey leaves to live with his mother. He asks Lauren to come with him, admitting that he still loves her, but Lauren decides to stay. Creation and development =Introduction= The character of Joey Branning and his casting was announced on 9 May 2012. David Witts was chosen to play Joey, the son of established character Derek Branning, played by Jamie Foreman. Speaking of his casting, Witts said, \\"I am delighted to be joining EastEnders after being a fan for so many years. Joining the Branning family couldn't have come at a better time especially after the recent British Soap Award wins.\\" Executive producer Lorraine Newman went on to say, \\"Joey is a fantastic addition to the Branning family. After an explosive entrance onto the Square, he is set to break a few hearts as he campaigns to bring Derek down.\\" The character's arrival meant that Derek would have to \\"face up to his past\\", and that Joey was eager to show his sister, Alice, what her father was really like. Joey was billed as \\"charming\\" but also \\"prides himself on telling it how it is, but is in fact a compulsive liar\\". The character was also easily able to attract girls, but likes to make them feel as though they made the first move ‚Äì even if he has nudged them into it. =Characterisation= Joey has been described as \\"Charming, good-looking, and a compulsive liar.\\" Upon being asked how he would describe his character, Witts commented, \\"Joey is a great character to play. He's actually a weird one to describe, because he's so different to everyone that he comes into contact with! Obviously his relationship with Derek is going to be very volatile and there's a lot of resentment there. Joey can be very dark, too ‚Äì not that he would admit it! [...] There are definitely some parallels between him and Derek, which are really interesting to explore. But there's a lot more to him than that, which is why I'm really enjoying portraying him. He's also a bit of a lothario, and when it comes to his family, he's very protective towards Alice. So depending on who you are when you meet Joey, you can get a number of different responses from him.\\" Vicky Prior of Metro News described Joey as an \\"oddity\\" in Albert Square. She added, \\"His father resembled a frog auditioning for a film about the Krays. His Uncle Max is lanky, ginger and balding, yet still a devil with the ladies. But Joey defied genetics and arrived on screen to adulation worthy of a One Direction band member.\\" Upon his exit in 2013, she said, \\"While Joey will be remembered for his physique, he has been an excellent character, with just the right amount of hardman swagger to offset his sweeter, romantic side.\\" In an interview with Digital Spy in 2013, Witts said, \\"I think I've been really lucky to have some big, big storylines. A lot of characters come in and stay in the background for a long time, but with Joey, I was lucky enough to come in and really get some good stuff. I'm really pleased with the scenes I've done with Jacqueline [Jossa] and I was very proud of how it played out. Before the Joey and Lauren storyline started, I think people had heard about the 'kissing cousins' and had a lot of reservations about it. But I was really pleased to see that once Joey and Lauren's relationship ended after the car crash, people had changed their minds and said, 'Well actually, they're so good together that we want them to get back together!' I was also really pleased with the aftermath of Derek's death. It was nice to show a vulnerable side to Joey, which usually isn't there.\\" =Relationship with Lauren Branning= In September 2012, a storyline surfaced where Lauren Branning would fall for her cousin, Joey. Over the next few weeks, Lauren would realise that she had feelings for her cousin, and would be forced to confront her feelings. An insider for EastEnders told the Daily Star, \\"This is going to be a huge storyline across the autumn [...] the more time they spend together the more they start to realise their feelings for each other are not just that of cousins.\\" Daniel Kilkelly later revealed that Lauren and Joey will be in a \\"horrifying\\" car crash. Filming for scenes begun on 10 September and is thought that the on-location filming will continue through the week. The details of the storyline are being kept under wraps but the Daily Mail reports that Lauren will joyride her uncle Derek's car but it goes horribly wrong and their lives are left hanging in the balance when Lauren loses control of the car and goes through a shop window. An insider commented \\"Everyone is really excited about these scenes. It's going to be a huge storyline for us in a few weeks' time, so it's definitely one for the fans to watch out for.\\" The storyline will reportedly air in November 2012 and is said to be one of the show's biggest moments of the year. Lauren is later dumped by Joey after Derek blackmails him. Witts said that Joey will find life \\"really hard\\" after dumping Lauren. Derek suggests to Joey that if he tells the police that he was driving the car that drunken Lauren crashed, she can avoid a prison sentence. Joey agrees to the deception to help Lauren but is later horrified when Derek threatens to tell the police the truth unless he gets his own way. Speaking to Soaplife, Witts said \\"Joey must either move in with Derek and be a respectful and loving son, or dump Lauren. If Joey takes either of those options, Derek won't tell the police that Lauren was driving the car. Joey's love for Lauren is massive, but not quite as massive as his hatred for Derek. He decides to become the villain and lie that he never loved her. He'll take the flack because that will make it easier for her to move on without him.\\" Witts also added that it will be \\"really hard\\" as he keeps making out to Lauren that he is not interested. Witts also said that Joey would be making a mistake if he told Lauren about Derek's blackmail. He commented \\"She's very headstrong and she'd say that she doesn't care about getting into trouble with the law. It would all end in tears. Everyone would find out as Lauren's the sort of person who'd blurt everything out, and it would cause even more of a mess. Joey very much thinks he's doing the right thing.\\" Tony Discipline said that he does not mind watching Jossa's, his real-life girlfriend's scenes and that he supports the Joey and Lauren plot commenting \\"I don't find it strange to watch ‚Äì it is part of the job. We always support each other and Jacqueline always asks me how it looks. But it is part of our job.\\" Upon being asked what his reaction was to Joey and Lauren's relationship, Witts said, \\"I was excited about it. From an actor‚Äôs point of view you don‚Äôt take it personally; you look at it and think this is a situation which is difficult for people but good for me. The more controversial a storyline is, the better for an actor because it‚Äôs interesting to play out and to discover what emotions you‚Äôd feel.\\" =Other relationships= Upon Joey's arrival in Albert Square, he takes an interest in Lucy Beale. Witts commented, \\"When Joey joins the Square, he finds out very quickly that Derek is being a real git to Lucy. Joey then becomes quite protective over her, and that‚Äôs quite attractive to him because he does like protecting people. Joey also knows that if he‚Äôs going to be around Lucy, then it‚Äôs going to annoy Derek! [...] On top of all that, there will be a slight attraction between Joey and Lucy, as he can see that she‚Äôs a pretty girl. But certainly at the start, it seems as though she‚Äôs being used by Joey to annoy Derek.\\" After Joey dumps Lauren, he begins a relationship with Lucy, whom is unaware that he was sleeping with his cousin. As a result, Lauren is heartbroken and extremely jealous. An EastEnders insider \\"‚ÄúLucy is smitten with Joey and is more than up for taking him back to her place. As you can imagine, Lauren is devastated. She‚Äôs really fallen for him and can‚Äôt believe how cruel he is being. She leaves and he ends up going home with Lucy. It‚Äôs not long before they‚Äôre getting it on but Joey‚Äôs mind is on Lauren and he tells Lucy he can‚Äôt be with her because he is in love with someone else. Lucy has no idea about Lauren and Joey but she is certainly going to do everything she can to find out who his mystery love interest is. Whilst Joey and Lucy are dating, he betrays her by kissing Whitney Dean. When Whitney informs Lauren about the kiss, she persuades her to tell Lucy. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said, \\"Although Whitney is hoping to forget the mistake ever happened, Lauren convinces her that she should come clean with Lucy rather than deceiving her. Lucy struggles with the news of Joey's betrayal when Whitney confesses what happened, especially as she thought their relationship was getting serious. When Joey later pays a visit to the chip shop, Lucy confronts him and has no time for his excuses. As she tells him that he can find somewhere else to sleep tonight, is it the end of the line for them?\\". In October 2012, a revenge plot against Joey is shown in which Lauren, Lucy and Whitney decide to \\"teach him a lesson\\". David Brown of Radio Times explained, \\"The girls are unimpressed by Joey‚Äôs carefree attitude towards relationships and come up with a plan to punish him [...] After luring him to the park with a text, Lucy handcuffs Joey to a bar in the playground. And once Lauren and Whitney come into view, he realises he‚Äôs been had.\\" Because of the feelings that Lauren had for Joey, she decided to release him later. When Alice is framed for murder by Janine Butcher, Joey realises that she is the only person who can clear Alice's name. He decides to seduce Janine, and they have a drink together. As Joey comforts Janine after Michael's funeral, they end up sleeping together. Joey realises he has feelings for Janine and has no regrets, hoping to take things further. David Brown of the Radio Times said, \\"You‚Äôd have thought that Joey and Janine wouldn‚Äôt be in the mood for passion. After all, Joey‚Äôs sister ,Alice, is currently languishing in jail for killing Michael ‚Äì a crime that Janine actually committed!\\" He went on to add, \\"After a particularly harrowing prison visit, Joey goes to see Janine with a bottle of wine. As they talk and drink more, Janine breaks down and Joey comforts her. Suddenly the chemistry between them turns to passion, but does Joey have some kind of plan in mind? Whatever his motives, it seems he‚Äôs certainly up for more.\\" Their relationship is short-lived, and Joey demands Janine to tell him the truth about Michael's murder. Rachel Lucas of What's on TV explained, \\"Determined to get the truth out of Janine, Joey corners her in the Vic, demanding she reveal what happened the night Michael died. David drags Joey outside, accusing him of behaving like his bully of a dad. Curious when Joey reveals that Michael tried to kill Janine with sleeping pills, David brings it up with Janine. When she overreacts David realises Joey was telling the truth and comes up with a plan...\\" The storyline concludes when Alice is found not guilty, however Janine is also found not guilty. =Departure= In January 2013, Witts hinted that he did not want to stay in EastEnders for too much longer. He revealed that he did not want to be an \\"EastEnders stalwart\\", and would like to return to theatre later in his career. Witts elaborated: \\"Not because there's anything wrong with it, but for me acting is a passion and it's about spreading yourself in different areas.\\" He added pessimistically: \\"I don't know if I'll still be at EastEnders in a year's time but I'll be more than happy if I am.\\" On 20 October 2013, it was announced that Witts had decided to leave EastEnders as Joey Branning and would depart at Christmas. Joey was set to be featured prominently on-screen for the rest of the year as he gets involved in the climax of his sister Alice's dark storyline with Michael Moon. An EastEnders spokesperson told the Daily Star, \\"We can confirm that David is leaving EastEnders later this year and we wish him all the best for the future.\\" Speaking of his departure, Witts commented, \\"They‚Äôre leaving the door open for me, which I‚Äôm really pleased about.\\" He added, \\"To be honest, it‚Äôs not going to be a massive exit because when you have one of those it‚Äôs then very hard for you to come back. So, it‚Äôs a nice story that gets me there, but it‚Äôs not going to be anything that people will be talking about for years to come!\\" Witts told Radio Times \\"It‚Äôs been a really quiet year [...] There have been lots of scenes of me just walking into the caf√© and saying ‚Äòall right‚Äô. However, it has started to pick up and get busier in the last couple of months. From Halloween through to Christmas, you'll be seeing a lot more of me.\\" Upon being asked why he had quit the soap, he said, \\"Eighteen months in, I just thought that now was the right time for me to go. For me, being an actor doesn‚Äôt mean just playing one part. I want to go through the process again of picking up a script and working out what I want to do with it.\\" Joey Branning departed on 26 December 2013. In 2018, Witts expressed an interest in returning to EastEnders as Joey Branning, saying it would be \\"hard\\" to turn down the chance. When asked if he would want to return, Witts replied, \\"Yeah, of course. The interesting thing about EastEnders is, I would need to gain about 10lbs in weight just to do that role again, because I was so much heavier back then [...] EastEnders is an iconic show and it's hugely successful. You absolutely can never kind of pooh-pooh that idea of going back to something so successful.\\" However, Witts also told Digital Spy, \\"That being said, I can't imagine they'll ask, though. I think everyone's dead in my family, aren't they? So if EastEnders ever wanted me to pop back for a bit, then I'd absolutely think about that. But I just can't imagine they will, because I don't think there's anyone there in terms of a story that would bring Joey back.\\" Reception Witts was very pleased with Joey's storylines, and he proved popular with fans. Witts won the award for 'Most Popular Newcomer' for his portrayal of Joey at the National Television Awards 2013. He also won 'Sexiest Male' at the Inside Soap Awards and was nominated again for 'Sexiest Male' at the British Soap Awards in 2013. Upon being asked how he felt about running for 'Most Popular Newcomer', Witts commented, \\"I'm absolutely thrilled! It's not something that I'd thought about before it happened, but obviously now that I've made the shortlist, I'm over the moon. To think that anyone has watched me and liked my work makes me really pleased.\\" Witts often felt uncomfortable about being dubbed as a soap pin-up. During an interview with Digital Spy in 2013, Witts commented, \\"I‚Äôm not very comfortable with it. It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve never been considered as before the show so it‚Äôs very, very odd and the idea of a ‚Äòsex symbol‚Äô is an uncomfortable phrase. It's one thing to say someone is nice looking but to describe them as ‚Äòsexy‚Äô or a ‚Äòsex symbol‚Äô I find something a bit seedy about it.\\" He also admitted to being \\"surprised\\" to win 'Sexiest Male' at the Inside Soap Awards, teling Digital Spy \\"I think it's utterly ridiculous and I disagree with the decision entirely! [...] But it's hilarious because I've never been considered sexy in my life ‚Äì probably not even by my girlfriend.\\" Gay Times said of the character: \\"[David Witts] plays Joey Branning. A quick Google on that shows the script writers are already making him take his clothes off. Bravo EastEnders script writers!\\" Heat called Witts one of their \\"TV hunks\\", saying, \\"The more evil Joey Branning gets, the more we swoon.\\" Inside Soap called Joey \\"the very definition of a soap bad boy\\" due to his good looks and charisma, the fact he has been damaged by his past and his success with women. Reflecting back at his time on EastEnders, Witts opened up and admitted that he struggled with all the fan attention that came with the role. \\"You can't go anywhere without people rushing up to you and wanting to take pictures and stuff and that's just so strange\\", he told Digital Spy. He went on to say, \\"When I look back on it, it was a really short amount of time, but it felt like I was in it for ages [...] I never anticipated doing it for very long and also I was so young. I was 21 years old and at that age I wanted to do so many different things. Maybe had I got that opportunity at a different age, my time would have been slightly different.\\" Nonetheless, Witts enjoyed his time on the soap. He told Digital Spy, \\"I look back on it now with such fondness. At the time, it all came and went in such a blur. Because first of all, I was terrified all the time. I spent a year and a half scared. I eventually learned how to navigate that world, but the soap world is unlike anything you'll ever see, really. It's very specific within the industry [...] I'm so proud of doing the work on there and having that little bit of success. But I guess at the time, it was just a crazy whirlwind. In some ways, I wish I had been a little bit older when having that experience, so that I could really fully appreciate it and soak it up, rather than just being terrified all the time!\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2012) *List of soap opera villains References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Fictional characters involved in incest Category:Male villains ","title":"Joey Branning"},{"id":"35756700","text":"Anodocheilus is a genus of beetles in the family Dytiscidae, containing the following species:Dytiscidae Species List at Joel Hallan's Biology Catalog.

The presiding officers were Chaskalson CJ, Langa DCJ, Ackermann J, Goldstone J, Kriegler J, Madala J, Ngcobo J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Du Plessis AJ and Skweyiya AJ. JG Wasserman SC (with A. Louw) appeared for the applicant at the request of the Court, and JA van S d'Oliveira SC (with AL Collopy and R. Sampson) for the State.  Procedure  The procedure envisaged in section 72(4) of the Criminal Procedure ActAct 51 of 1977. consists of two distinct yet connected enquiries. The court may, but need not, undertake either enquiry. The first is when the court considers whether or not to issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused person. At this stage the accused is absent and the court of its own accord establishes whether the two pre-conditions to issue a warrant of arrest exist. These conditions are that the accused person # had been duly warned in terms of sections (1)(a) or (b); and # has failed to comply with the warning. The second phase begins when the accused person is brought to court and the summary procedure is invoked. At this stage it is not necessary for the court to be satisfied afresh as to whether the two pre-conditions exist. Their existence will ordinarily appear from the record and therefore be prima facie established. The court is indeed required to record in full the proceedings at which the warning is given, and an extract of such proceedings, if certified as correct, is prima facie proof of the warning given. It is therefore imperative that the warning be recorded in full. Where the warning was issued by a police official, the terms of the warning will appear from a written notice completed by the official. When the accused appears in court pursuant to the provisions of section 72(4), she or he may be asked by the presiding officer whether non-compliance with the warning is conceded. Depending on the response to the question, the summary procedure may continue. In order to comply with the obligation imposed by section 35(3) of the Constitution, the presiding officer implementing the 72(4) procedure must ensure that it is fair. Therefore, unless the accused is legally represented, the court ought, the moment it decides to pursue the matter of the ostensible non-compliance with the warning, to explain the nature and requirements and effect of the proceedings about to be commenced. This explanation should include telling the accused that it appears from the record that she or he was duly warned‚Äîthe contents of the warning may have to be explained‚Äîand that there was a non- appearance or other failure to comply with the warning. It should include telling the accused * that such non-compliance is an offence for which the law allows a fine or imprisonment of up to three months; and * that, unless the pre-conditions are cogently challenged, they may be regarded as having been established, whereupon the court will be empowered there and then to investigate the issue of culpable non-compliance and intends doing so. In addition to the above, the presiding officer is obliged to inform an undefended accused of his or her basic procedural rights. The enquiry must be conducted in a fair and impartial manner. As part of the enquiry, the presiding officer must establish from the accused whether she or he disputes the fact that she or he was duly warned, giving the details of the warning as recorded, and that she or he failed to comply with the warning. If the accused does not dispute the two basic facts, the presiding officer must then establish from the accused the reason for his failure to appear in court. Fairness requires the presiding officer to assist an undefended accused to explain their failure to appear in court by putting questions to the accused. By its very nature, the enquiry envisaged in section 72(4) contemplates that the presiding officer will play an active role in such an enquiry by putting questions to the accused. The objective of such questions is to elicit the explanation, if any, for failure to appear in court. Provided that the questioning is conducted in a fair and impartial manner, this will help an undefended accused to put forward the reason for his failure to appear in court.Paras 9-13.  Judgment  It could not be gainsaid, the court held, that the person being dealt with in terms of section 72(4) was an accused person as contemplated in section 35(3) of the Constitution. From this it followed that the provisions of section 35(3) were applicable to the enquiry.Para 15. = Constitutionality of the summary procedure in section 72(4) = The court found that, although the procedure provided for in s 72(4) is summary and does not conform to the customary adversarial trial procedure, the enquiring court is obliged to furnish details of the alleged offence to the accused. The elements of the charge are likely to be very simple. Should the accused require particularity, however, the enquiring court must furnish it there and then. The absence of a formal written charge-sheet, therefore, is of no consequence. While the accused does not have the opportunity to make a formal written request for further particulars, he nevertheless enjoys the right to be informed of the details of the charge against him. The court held, accordingly, that the summary procedure does not, in this respect, limit the accused's right to a fair trial. There is, furthermore, nothing is section 72(4) to the effect that the right to adduce and challenge evidence is limited.Paras 19, 21. The purpose of the summary procedure, the court found, is to get the accused to explain his failure to comply with a warning. To achieve this purpose, the burden of proof is imposed upon the accused, which, if he should fail to discharge it, usually results in a conviction. Remaining silent, therefore, invariably invites conviction. This is so because the fact of the warning and the failure to comply will ordinarily become conclusive proof and, in the absence of an explanation for the failure, the conviction must usually ensue. Viewed in this context, the court found that the summary procedure and the burden of proof imposed upon the accused are inseparable. The burden of proof is essential to the effectiveness of the summary procedure and the achievement of its purpose. The combined effect of the two is that the accused is compelled to break her or his silence by the risk of a conviction. To this extent, the court determined, the summary procedure envisaged in s 72(4) limits the right to remain silent and not to testify at such an inquiry.Para 23. = Limitation on the right to be presumed innocent and the right to remain silent = The effect of the phrase \\"unless such a person satisfies the court that his failure was not due to fault on his part\\" was found by the court to be plain. Once the warning and the failure to comply with it have been established, the accused must establish that the failure was not due to his or her fault. If the probabilities are evenly balanced, the accused has failed to satisfy the court as required. Conviction and sentence must therefore follow. In effect, the court found, where there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the failure to appear was due to the fault of the accused, he or she is nevertheless liable to be convicted because the court has not been satisfied as required by the provision. What emerges from s 72(4), therefore, are two features that raised constitutional concerns for the court: # It requires the accused to disprove fault, which is an element of the offence he or she faces. # The accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. These, the court held, are clear limitations of the right to be presumed innocent guaranteed in section 35(3)(h) of the Constitution. Apart from this, the accused was compelled to adduce evidence in order to avoid a conviction. The effect of the presumption therefore was to force the accused to break his silence. Therefore, s 72(4) limited the rights to be presumed innocent and to remain silent guaranteed in s 35(3)(h) of the Constitution.Paras 28-31. = Justification for limitation of accused's rights = The court held, having regard to the importance of dealing effectively with conduct that hampers the administration of justice, that the incursion into the right to silence was justifiable. The same could not be said, however, of the legal burden which required a conviction despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.Para 37. Section 72(4) also limited the right to be presumed innocent. The South African conception of justice and forensic fairness demands that an accused person be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and that the State be required to establish his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 72(4) demanded the opposite, presuming the accused guilty and requiring the accused to establish his innocence on a balance of probabilities. It carried the risk that an innocent person might be sent to jail. That this may have been a rare occurrence did not matter. The court held that, once it is established that such a risk exists, a fundamental principle of the South African criminal justice system has been offended.Para 38. Having regard to the importance of the right to be presumed innocent in the South African criminal justice system and the fact that the State could have achieved its objective by less intrusive means, the imposition of the legal burden upon an accused had a disproportional impact on the right in question. In these circumstances, the court held, the risk of convicting an innocent person was too high, and outweighed the other considerations in favour of the limitation. There were no compelling societal reasons in this particular case that would justify imposing this legal burden on the accused. Therefore, the court held that the limitation was not justified.Para 40. = Remedy = Striking down section 72(4) and leaving it at that, the court held, would leave a vacuum in the present legislative structure which was designed to deal with conduct that hinders the administration of justice. In this regard, the court thought it important to bear in mind that section 72(4) deals with the case of an accused who has failed to comply with the warning to appear in court. There was no other provision that dealt with such an accused. While it was true that Parliament could remedy the situation, that would take time; in the interim a gap would remain. In all the circumstances, the court found it appropriate to read in words necessary to establish an evidentiary burden. This would be less invasive than simply to strike down section 72(4), which accordingly was henceforth to be read as if the words \\"there is a reasonable possibility that\\" appeared between the words \\"that\\" and \\"his failure.\\"Paras 43-44.

Background Born John Luttrell, he was the second son of Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton by Judith Maria Lawes, daughter of Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor of Jamaica. He was the grandson of Colonel Henry Luttrell and the brother of Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton, James Luttrell, and Lady Anne Luttrell, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn. He was a member of the Irish branch of the ancient family of Luttrell and a descendant of Sir Geoffrey de Luterel, who established Luttrellstown Castle, County Dublin in the early 13th century.Enchanting Ireland Naval and political career Luttrell was a Captain in the Royal Navy but retired in 1789. He was returned to Parliament for Stockbridge in 1774, a seat he held until 1775, and again between 1780 and 1785. Between 1785 and 1826 he was a commissioner of HM Customs and Excise. He succeeded his elder brother to the earldom in 1821. This was an Irish peerage and did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Family In 1766 Lord Carhampton married the Honorable Elizabeth Olmius, 1472-1797, daughter of John Olmius, 1st Baron Waltham. In 1787, out of respect after the death of his father-in- law, he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of 'Olmius', In 1798 he sold the Olmius family seat of New Hall to the founding nuns of New Hall School. There were three children from Lord Carhampton's first marriage (however only his daughter would survive to adulthood): A. F.

According to the legend, the first settlers of Rome found that their huts collapsed as soon as built, whereupon Abba ·∏≤olon said to them, \\"Unless you mix water from the Euphrates with your mortar, nothing that you build will stand.\\" Then he offered to supply such water, and for this purpose journeyed through the East as a cooper, and returned with water from the Euphrates in wine-casks. The builders mixed this water with the mortar and built new huts that did not collapse. Hence the proverb, \\"A city without Abba ·∏≤olon is not worthy of the name.\\" The newly built city was therefore called \\"Babylonian Rome\\".Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:6 Probably this legend was intended to show the dependence of the Roman empire upon the natural resources of the East; but it contains a number of points that still remain unexplained. The above-mentioned Roman, or, more properly, Greco-Roman, proverb is just as obscure as the name \\"Abba ·∏≤olon,\\" which, originating in some classic word, was distorted by the Jews into \\"a father of a colony,\\" not without the mental reservation that \\"·∏≤olon\\" is the Aramaic equivalent of \\"shame.\\" An attempt has been made to identify the name with that of Deucalion, to which it bears no philological or historical relation. The most probable identification is that by Br√ºll, who refers to a legend in John Malalas' \\"Chronicles,\\" p. 301, of a magician named Ablaccon, under the emperor Tiberius.

In 1335, he was already very old (Samuel of Marseilles, in \\"√âcrivains Juifs,\\" p. 562, according to which the note in \\"Rev. √ât. Juives,\\" ix. 59, must be corrected). Of the many writings of Abba Mari, who, according to his contemporary, Isaac de Lattes, wrote commentaries on the Pentateuch, Job, parts of the Talmud, and Pir·∏≥e de-Rabbi Eliezer, as well as works on physics, logic, and metaphysics, merely fragments are extant, and these in manuscript only. His commentary on Job is found in several European libraries; it is not a commentary in an exegetical or historical sense, but is full of philosophical disquisitions upon the Biblical theodicy. The existence of Job is doubted by Abba Mari, as by some of the Talmudic rabbis. He says that, at any rate, the book bearing his name was not written by Job, as some authorities in the Talmud admit, but by Moses. Job's four friends represent in their personalities four different views of evil in the world. Eliphaz, representative of tradition, denies altogether the reality of evil, in agreement with Deut. xxxii. 4. Bildad, on the other hand, does not deny its reality, but holds, as-if he had been the loyal disciple of the old rabbis and Motazilites, that God allows the just to suffer here in order to reward them the more in the future life. Zophar, too, considers evil a reality; with the Ascharites, with whom many rabbis agree, he insists on man's ignorance of the divine will, which finite man ought not to investigate. Elihu is of the same opinion as Eliphaz, but with the difference that what Eliphaz accepts as a matter of faith, Elihu demonstrates philosophically. It can thus be seen that Abba Mari was a loyal student of Maimonides, and that, like him, he considered revelation and true philosophy as identical. Whether a philosophical and allegorical commentary on the Song of Songs, in manuscript in the Cambridge and Oxford libraries and ascribed to him, is really his, or should be credited to Moses of Narbonne, with whom Abba Mari is elsewhere confounded, is uncertain. The same doubt holds concerning the Hebrew translation of Gazzali's \\"Tendencies of Philosophers,\\" which is ascribed to Abba Mari, but possibly also belongs to the aforesaid Moses. But there is no reason for Steinschneider's doubt concerning a Munich manuscript, containing the introduction to the first book of Euclid, with the superscription, \\"Written by Abba Mari, philosopher and teacher of truth.\\"; it certainly belongs to our Abba Mari, and the words Abba Mari are not to be translated \\"My Lord and Father,\\" for these two words would otherwise have their proper place at the beginning and not at the end of the sentence. Abba Mari also wrote \\"Refutations,\\" in which he assailed Joseph Caspi's \\"Book of Secrets.\\" This book, with the exception of a few quotations from it in other writers, has disappeared.
