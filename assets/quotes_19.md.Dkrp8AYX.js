The tigress was attacking humans initially alone, but later she was assisted by her sub-adult cub. The figures however are uncertain, as the natives of the areas the tigers frequented claimed double that number, and they do not take into account victims who survived direct attacks but died subsequently. Both tigers were killed by Jim Corbett. First victim On December 15, 1925, a group of men from the village of Dalkania went up a hill to the hut of a Bhutia in order to complain to him for having seemingly allowed his goats into their crop fields. The man‚Äôs sheep dog was found dead, and the next day, his remains were found 100 yards from the hut. Jim Corbett was called upon from Nainital to hunt down the tigers in February 1929. Three man-eaters had been reported in the Kumaon Division at the time, and Corbett chose to hunt the Chowgarh tigers due to their higher body count. A map recording the sites of each kill showed that the tigers were most active in the villages of the north-eastern face of the Kala Agar ridge. Corbett arrived at the Kala Agar Forest Bungalow in April that year after a four-day march. The last victim in the area had been a 22-year-old cattle grazer. The victim‚Äôs grandmother offered Corbett three buffaloes, in addition to his four, for use as bait. Upon receiving updates on the tigers' whereabouts, Corbett set off to the village of Dalkania away the next day. Upon arriving, he was informed that the tigers had unsuccessfully attacked a party of women picking corn north of Dalkania. Corbett left for the village at 3:00 p.m. and arrived the next day, where he found the village in a state of panic. Hunt for the tigers At midday, Corbett left for the valley where the villagers had heard the tigers calling. By evening, he reached the upper end of the valley without having seen anything, and by the following afternoon, Corbett was met by a cattle grazer stating that the tigers had taken a cow that night. Tracking the tigers to a ravine, he found the predators eating the dead cow. Corbett fired at the lighter-coloured animal, assuming it was the adult. Upon hearing the shot, the other tiger bolted, and Corbett, upon examining the carcass, found that the dead tiger was in fact the cub. After the cub was shot, the tigress attacks on human became less successful, as she was sometimes unable to kill victims on her own. First hunt for the tigress The following day, Corbett decided to use the four buffalo baits. For ten days, there were no reports of attacks and the buffalos were untouched. On the eleventh day, a woman was attacked half a mile on the far side of the village. After dressing her wounds, Corbett tied a bait goat on a nearby tree, though it was not taken. Three days later, Corbett was informed that a woman had been killed in Lohali, a village five miles (8 km) to the south of Dalkania. Upon arrival, Corbett was approached by a village elder who implored him to save his daughter who had escaped from the tiger with serious injuries. Though Corbett dressed her wounds with permanganate, she died the following night. After a week, Corbett left Dalkania, though he promised to return upon hearing of another attack. During the journey, Corbett saw fresh pugmarks, and warned a buffalo herder nearby to be wary. Immediately after Corbett left, the herder was attacked by the tigress, which was driven off by the buffaloes. Before dying, the herder warned his village of the tigress‚Äô presence. Second hunt for the tigress In February the next year, Corbett returned to Dalkania, where many deaths had occurred since his departure. Corbett tied a buffalo in the forest near the village, and shot two tigers accepting the bait. Upon inspecting the carcasses, he found that neither were the man-eater. After staying in Dalkania for a few weeks, Corbett left to attend an appointment with the district officials in the terai. Third hunt for the tigress On 22 March 1930, Corbett received an urgent request from his District Commissioner to go to Kala Agar, fifty miles from Nainital. On arrival, Corbett was told that the tigress had recently killed a woman in the vicinity. Corbett tied his four buffaloes from Dalkania in strategic locations, one of which was killed four nights later. The culprits turned out to be a pair of leopards, which were immediately shot in order to prevent them killing more bait. Death of the tigress and post-mortem On 11 April 1930, nineteen days after his arrival in Kala Agar, Corbett, along with two other men, tied the buffalo baits near an area where a young man had been previously killed. When positioning himself in a ravine, Corbett‚Äôs companions rushed to him, saying they had heard the tigress nearby. Corbett encountered the tigress face to face shortly after, sitting next to a large boulder. Corbett fatally shot the animal from a distance of eight feet, whose death coincided with an end to the attacks. An examination of the tigress‚Äô body showed that her claws and one canine tooth were broken and her front teeth were completely worn down. It was these disabilities that Corbett concluded led this tigress to having become a man eater as it was thus hampered in killing wild game. Corbett used a .450/400 Nitro Express double rifle made by W.J. Jeffery & Co to hunt the grown up cub of Chowgarh tigress which was assisting the mother tigress in its attacks on human beings. The other rifle used by Corbett was a lighter Rigby Mauser made on Mauser 98 action by John Rigby & Company, which he refers to as .275 Rigby in his writings. This calibre is same as the 7√ó57mm Mauser. It was this .275 Rigby with which he killed the Chowgarh tigress on 11 April 1930 at a location Corbett describes as being two miles west of Kala Agar, a mountain village at the time.

A wicket-keeper, Livsey played 320 matches and was considered one of the greatest keepers of the 1920s with 649 dismissals. retrieved 3 June 2008Wynne-Thomas, Arlott and Isaacs, p. 275. He was also a tidy keeper, allowing only three byes during Oxford's 554-run innings in his first match. For this success he became Hampshire's regular keeper, and performed a noted stumping of Jack Hobbs in 1914. He fought during World War I, and was demobilised for the 1920 season. He continued at Hampshire until 1929, when his health forced him into retirement. Early life Livsey was born in Todmorden, Yorkshire, and was registered at birth as Walter Herbert Livesey, though he would use Livsey for the rest of his life. Initially, Livsey hoped to find a career at The Oval however the form of Bert Strudwick, who would later play 28 tests for England and took 1237 catches and 258 stumpings in first-class cricket, meant that he could not find a place. He was later persuaded to move to Hampshire to begin his cricketing career. Career Livsey's debut for Hampshire came on 30 June 1913 against Oxford University CC at the County Ground, Southampton.First- Class Matches played by Walter Livsey from CricketArchive retrieved 3 June 2008 He scored 11* and 7*, taking two catches and making one stumping. Hampshire v Oxford University scorecard, 30 June - 1 July 1913, from CricketArchive retrieved 3 June 2008 He allowed only three byes in the University's first innings of 554. Such tidy keeping prompted Hampshire to take Livsey on as their regular keeper. He played his first full season the following year, playing 28 matches in all. Batting at number ten in the order, Livsey was not out on many occasions, 20 of his 37 innings during this season alone and across his whole career he was not out on 137 occasions. First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Walter Livsey from CricketArchive retrieved 3 June 2008 He scored only 130 runs in the 1914 season, with a high score of 42* and an average of 7.64, however he took 39 catches and completed 23 stumpings. The most famous of these, of Surrey player Jack Hobbs, was made on 23 July 1914 during a 3-day match at Portsmouth. Hobbs, on three,Hampshire v Surrey - County Championship 1914 from CricInfo retrieved 3 June 2008 was bowled a \\"sharply lifting ball\\" by Alec Kennedy which was passing wide of leg stump. Livsey was able to retrieve the ball and remove the bails before Hobbs could get back behind the crease. This dismissal, of such a prestigious player, caused \\"quite a sensation\\" according to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Upon the outbreak of World War I at the end of the 1914 cricket season, Livsey joined the war effort.

Livsey was not demobilised until 1919, and thus missed this season in England. He returned for the 1920 season, however, and enjoyed greater form with the bat: playing 26 matches and scoring 285 runs at 12.95. He also scored his maiden half-century with a season high score of 50*, and enjoyed success with the gloves also, taking 23 catches and completing 26 stumpings. This was to be surpassed in the 1921 season, however, with 48 catches and 32 stumpings from 29 matches. His form with the bat also improved, hitting 471 runs at 15.19, including two half-centuries and a high score of 70*. The latter score formed part of a 192 partnership with Horace Alexander William Bowell against Worcestershire on 10 August 1921.Hampshire v Worcestershire - County Championship 1921 from CricketArchive retrieved 3 June 2008 In 1922, Livsey played 31 matches, with 348 runs at 14.50, 35 catches and 22 stumpings. During this season Livsey forged a partnership of 177 with George Brown against Warwickshire, who had scored 223 in their first innings and bowled Hampshire out for 15. In the follow-on, Hampshire had a lead of 66 when Livsey came in at number ten, however his maiden century, 110* with Brown and later Stuart Boyes, gave Hampshire a 155 run victory. He failed to pass 50 on any other occasions during that season, however. The 1923 season saw reduced success for Livsey with the bat. He scored one half-century, however his season total was a lower 247 at 9.14, and this included 14 not outs. His glove work continued to be successful, however, taking 38 catches and performing 21 stumpings. In 1924 Livsey improved his batting once again with 369 runs at 12.72, with a high score of 67. In the 29 matches he played during the season, he also took 21 catches and completed 21 stumpings. In 1925 success with both bat and gloves continued, with 425 runs at 15.74, 21 catches and 21 stumpings from 27 matches, and 1926 saw a career-best 562 runs at 19.37, with two half-centuries, a top score of 54, 34 catches and 18 stumpings, all from 29 matches. Livsey's batting continued to reach new heights in 1927, when he hit another career-best 615 runs from 27 matches at 20.50, the first time he had ever broken into the 20s with his batting average. He scored two half-centuries, the highest being 56*, and took 29 catches and completed 13 stumpings. His form with the bat peaked in 1928.

It is owned and run by Charles Back, who also owns The Goats do Roam Wine Company and The Spice Route Winery. Location The Fairview farm is on the south western slopes of the Paarl mountain range, approximately 60 km from Cape Town. The farm comprises 320 hectares, of which 120 hectares are planted to vineyard. The farm ranges in altitude from 400m above sea level on the slopes of the mountain to 180m on the valley floor. The farm is located at 33¬∞46'21‚Ä≥ south 18¬∞55'25‚Ä≥ east. Early history The current Fairview property was first designated as a farm by the then Governor of the Cape Simon van der Stel in 1693, with Steven Vervey the first official owner. Vervey is thought to be one of the French Huguenots who arrived in the Cape in 1688. The earliest recorded name for the property is Bloemkoolfontein (directly translated from Afrikaans as cauliflower fountain) and hints at the mixed agriculture that took place on the property over the centuries. Towards the end of the 19th century the name of the property was officially changed to Fairview. Charles Back purchased the Fairview farm from a Mr Hugo in 1937 for the sum of 6500 pounds. Fairview has been in the Back family to the present day. The Backs Charles Louis Back was a Lithuanian immigrant to the Cape, who arrived in South Africa in 1902. He settled in Paarl where he set up a butcher shop as well as selling farm produce from the local farmers. Through these dealings he was offered a piece of land on the farm Klein Babylonstoren in the Paarl winelands. In 1916 Charles Back purchased what would later become the Backsberg farm from David Louw and left the butchery behind to become a wine farmer. In 1926 he was awarded the General Smuts Trophy for South Africa's champion wine. After establishing himself and learning the trade, Charles Back purchased Fairview from Hugo in 1937, for the sum of 6500 pounds. Charles Back had two sons, Sydney and Cyril, in whom Back instilled a love for the land, as well as a strong work ethic. When Charles died in 1955, he left Backsberg to Sydney and Fairview to Cyril. Cyril spent much of his first years at Fairview replanting and planning vineyards. In 1974, Cyril broke away from the KWV; as a result, the first wines under the Fairview Estate label were bottled in this year. In 1975, Cyril held South Africa's first public wine auction and, together with his wife, Beryl, began to recognise the farm's possibilities of public visitation. Fairview become one of the first farms to open cellar door sales to the public. Cyril's son, Charles, joined Fairview in 1978, after completing his winemaking studies at Elsenburg agricultural college. In 1981, Charles built Fairview's goat tower. History The first recorded wine production on the property was in 1699 and wine grape cultivation has continued to this day. When Charles Back purchased Fairview in 1937 the farm was primarily planted to the then common varietal Cinsau(l)t, and this formed the majority of the wine produced at Fairview in the 1940s and 1950s. When Cyril Back took over in 1955, following his father's death, he replanted most of the Fairview vineyards. He introduced Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Pinotage to the property. In 1974 Cyril Back was amongst the first producers to break away from the strictly regulated body controlling South African wine at the time, where grape growers supplied their grapes to the co- operative KWV. He established Fairview as an independent estate and the first wines were bottled under the Fairview label in 1974, from grapes grown exclusively on the Fairview property. The first wines bottled were a Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Pinotage. In 1975 Cyril Back held South Africa's first public wine auction, with his entire 1975 production selling in under three hours. This auction pre-dated the now famous Nederburg Auction, which started the following year. With Charles Back joining his father in 1978, Fairview's range of wines began to diversify, with white wines being added to the portfolio and new varietals being planted. Charles also introduced innovative winemaking practices. Using the Gamay varietal, Fairview produced South Africa's first Beaujolais nouveau style wine in 1987 using the traditional carbonic maceration method. During the late 1980s Charles began watch the international wine trends more closely, making subtle adjustments to bring the quality of his wines in line with international standards. These markets had always been closed to South African wines due to Apartheid sanctions. Charle's proactive approach meant that when democracy came to South Africa and the markets opened, Fairview's wine style and quality was quickly recognised internationally. Cyril Back died in 1995 and Charles took full control of Fairview. In 1997 Charles Back appointed Anthony de Jager as head winemaker at Fairview. Current production Approximately 50 000 twelve bottle cases are produced under the Fairview label annually. Seventy percent of Fairview's production is exported, with the company's leading export markets being the United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany. In 2008 Fairview launched the La Capra range of wines, an endorsed label targeting the retail and value end of the wine market. Grape varietals Fairview produces a wide range of varietals under its label and 70% of production is red wine. Grapes for these wines are sourced from Charles Back's own vineyards as well as from contracted growers. Amongst others, the Fairview range of wines includes: White wines: Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chardonnay, Viognier, Oom Pagel Semillon and Viognier Special Late Harvest. Red wines: Shiraz, Pinotage, Mourv√®dre, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tannat, Petite Sirah, Pinotage Viognier, Sweet Red, Solitude Shiraz, The Beacon Shiraz, Jakkalsfontein Shiraz, Pegleg Carignan, Primo Pinotage and the farm's flagship Cyril Back. Cheesemaking at Fairview History Cheese production at Fairview started in 1980, when Cyril Back purchased a herd of Saanen milking goats and brought them to the farm. At the time, goats milk cheese was an unknown product in South Africa. Cyril employed the assistance of Michele Agostinelli to begin the Fairview Vineyard Cheesery, producing a small range of goats' milk cheeses for sale from the farm. In 1992, Louis Lourens was employed as head cheese maker. In 1995 Jersey milk was introduced and subsequently the range of cheeses produced expanded to include cow's milk cheeses as well as a range of products combining cow and goats' milk. Current production Fairview is South Africa's leading producer of artisanal and speciality cheeses. In 2008, the Fairview goat herd is the largest commercial goat herd in Africa, numbering 750 does in the permanent milking herd. The milk from these goats, along with the milk from an exclusive single Jersey cow herd are brought to the Vineyard Cheesery daily. There are over twenty permanent lines in the Fairview cheese range, including blue mould, white mould and cream cheese products. These products are available at major retailers throughout South Africa. Tourism Fairview Wine and Cheese estate is one of the most visited attractions in the Cape winelands. The farm offers tasting of its full range of wines and cheeses in their tasting room, seven days a week. There is also an eatery on the farm, which is housed in a converted wine cellar. Wine tourism has seen strong growth in South Africa and Fairview's combination of wine and cheese is very popular amongst locals as well as international tourists.

Following a succession of affirmative reviews in Norway, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK McLean independently supported the release with tours, interviews and industry showcases. She was interviewed on BBC Liverpool by the noted musicologist Spencer Leigh. In June 2007, McLean performed live to BBC Radio 2 from Toronto‚Äôs CBC station. McLean‚Äôs first two CDs have been met with critical acclaim but have not sold in substantial numbers to attain break through status.  Mandolin Records  Mandolin Records was a pre-production studio in Muskoka. McLean created Muskoka Song Night, hosting an evening of great Canadian singer songwriters at the Hideaway Pub in downtown Huntsville. Guests included Katherine Wheatley, Robert Priest, Carlos del Junco, Karyn Ellis, James Gordon, Jon Brooks, Marianne Girard, Suzie Vinnick, Craig Cardiff, Jenny Whiteley, Laura Repo, Blair Packham, Tannis Slimmon and Lewis Melville, among others. Linda McLean was the last person to sing in the landmark venue. Two nights after October's Song Night, the Empire Hotel was destroyed by fire and the subsequent water damage of an enthusiastic local fire department. The song she sang, accompanied by her husband Andy and Slimmon and Melville, was \\"Beauty\\". Under Mandolin Records and Huntsville Festival of the Arts, McLean created The Songwriter‚Äôs Session, one hour preceding Muskoka Song Night to offer groups of local Muskoka songwriters an opportunity to spend an intensive hour with a seasoned professional. Under Mandolin Records, McLean continues to offer workshops and produce live music events for various organizations.  Advocacy  McLean is married to Andy McLean, Executive Director of ECMA was former managing director of North by Northeast Music and Film Festival and Conference for 18 years and created an ethos of support to music and musicians first, predicting and supporting the rise and influence of independent music in Canada. In the early years of NXNE (1993 to 1996) Linda McLean was directly involved as the office and conference coordinator, helping establish the event as the primary music industry event in Canada. McLean has been a showcasing artist at SXSW 2003 in Austin TX at the Hideout, and at NXNE 2006 in Toronto ON at the Drake.  Educator  McLean is founding partner and facilitator of Women's Music Weekend, with singer-songwriter Katherine Wheatley and singer-songwriter Jane Lewis and hosted the first four weekends at Mandolin Records Studio in Muskoka. McLean was one of the original Faculty members of the Independent Music Production at Seneca College in Toronto (where she taught from 2004 to 2007). McLean was consulted as an independent artist and educator to create and develop the programs and curriculum for Artist Development, Songwriting, Industry Overview and Music Theory.

It is one of the oldest known ploughs found in Europe.  Location and discovery  The plough was discovered on 9 July 1927 by Jann Han√üen and his son Heye at the bottom edge of a deep layer of peat. As a reward, Han√üen received 50 Reichsmark, which he had to share with the landowner, a man called Weinstock.  Extent of excavation  The ploughbeam is made from a single oak branch approximately long. The ploughshare originally measured about . The handle is set in a rectangular opening of the share and stabilised by additional wedges. The front part of the share is missing, because the plough had been accidentally cut into several pieces by its finders. Pollen samples were taken in 1927 for palynological analysis. This showed that the plough dates to the Early Bronze Age at the earliest. Since it represents a fairly developed form of the scratch plough, the Walle find could also date to the later Bronze Age or Early Iron Age. A similar plough, also of oak and of similar measurements, was found at Papau near Toru≈Ñ. The scratch plough type is known through finds and images from the Neolithic, the Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as from Hallstatt culture, Etruscan, Greek and Roman contexts. The basic form is still in use in the Mediterranean region. Why the Walle Plough had been deposited in a bog is not known. Perhaps it was meant to be temporarily sunk in the bog during the winter, to preserve its wood. In 1983, a roughly 3000-year-old stone axe was found nearby.  Date  After the plough had begun to physically deteriorate around 1937, it was brought to the Lower Saxony State Museum at Hanover for conservation. It is still on display there. The examination of pollen and peat samples indicated that the plough could not be allocated to any period with certainty. Originally it had been estimated to be from the 4th millennium BC, but in the 1950s this was revised to a date around 2000 BC. A replica of the plough is on display in the Historical Museum at Aurich. At Walle, a stone marks the findspot. Literature * Karl-Ernst Behre / Hajo van Lengen: Ostfriesland.

Although he was a light hitter offensively, he had a strong arm, throwing out 47.74% of the base runners who tried steal on him, ranking him fourth on the all-time list. Chicago Cubs Bertell was born in Oak Park, Illinois. The Cubs signed him as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa State University in . He made his major league debut with the Cubs in the second game of a doubleheader on September 22, 1960. Though he went hitless, Bertell knocked in a run with a sacrifice fly in his first at-bat. He recorded his first major league hit three days later, singling off Bob Grim of the St. Louis Cardinals. He went 2-for-15 in his first season, knocking in two runs in five games. Bertell found himself in a platoon role with the Cubs in 1961, seeing the majority of the playing time (92 games) behind the plate for the hapless Cubs. He hit his first major league home run on July 6 off Pittsburgh's Vinegar Bend Mizell, and, overall, had a decent season at the plate for a catcher. Bertell hit .273 with two home runs and 33 RBI. However, his playing time decreased the next season as the Cubs again stumbled to a ninth-place finish in the National League. In 77 games, he posted a career-best batting average of .302 with two home runs and 18 RBIs, and despite playing in fewer than half the team's games, Bertell still played more innings at catcher than anyone else on the 1962 team. The 1963 season found the Cubs rebounding and posting a winning record for the first time since 1946. Bertell also saw his playing time increase, his third straight season as the club's starting catcher. He led National League catchers in with a 60.8% baserunners caught stealing percentage, the twelfth highest single-season total in Major League history. Unfortunately, he could not maintain his previous season's batting prowess, dipping to .233 with 2 home runs and 14 RBI. In 1964, Bertell had career best totals of doubles (11), triples (3), home runs (4) and RBIs (35), and had a batting average of .238. He also led National League catchers in throwing out baserunners with 34. San Francisco Giants Bertell spent the first two months of the 1965 campaign as the Cubs' starting catcher. He batted .214 with two extra-base hits (both doubles) in 34 games. On May 29, the Cubs traded him along with Len Gabrielson to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for Harvey Kuenn, Ed Bailey, and Bob Hendley. His playing time significantly decreased with the Giants, as he saw action in 22 games over the final four months of the season, hitting .188 as a backup to regular catcher Tom Haller. Bertell was under contract to San Francisco in but he did not play in the majors. Just prior to the beginning of the 1967 season, the Giants traded him back to the Cubs for Don Bryant. He played two games with the Cubs, on April 11 and April 12, before being released. His final major league hit was a triple off Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, his first triple since 1964. Death Bertell died on December 20, 1999 in Mission Viejo, California. In 2000, Bertell was inducted into the Iowa State Hall of Fame.

He is noted for his photography, as an educator running photography workshops, and as manager of MediaWeb, a software company specialising in photo database solutions and server-based digital archiving systems. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2013. In 2014, he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.List of members of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Early life and education The older of two siblings, Bartholomew was born on 18 December 1955 in New Delhi, India. His father, Richard Bartholomew (1926‚Äì1985) was a Burmese refugee who settled in the Indian capital and who came to be one of the country's leading art critics, as well as a painter, poet, and photographer. His mother, Rati Batra, a Partition refugee, was a well-known theatre activist and one of the founding members of Yatrik, a theatre company established in 1964.Joy Michael Bartholomew studied at Modern School, where his father taught English. He abandoned his schooling in Class Nine, adopting the camera instead. In his early teens he photographed his family, friends, people, and cities. He participated in the city‚Äôs emerging theatre scene and even produced, in the ‚Äô70s, a series of events called ‚ÄúThru Pablo‚Äôs Eyes‚Äù which was based on rock music accompanied with slide and film projection and live performers. To make ends meet, and to finance his photo documentary projects, he worked in advertising and as a stills photographer, most notably on the sets of Satyajit Ray's Shatranj ke Khilari (1977) and Richard Attenborough's 1982-film, Gandhi. In 1975, he was awarded First Prize by World Press Photo for his series \\"Time is the mercy of eternity,\\" on morphine addicts in India titled Time is the Mercy of Eternity. Photojournalism From 1984 until 2000, Bartholomew was represented by the French-American news photo agency, Gamma Liaison during which time he primarily covered conflicts and developments in the South Asian region. His photographs were published in New York Times, Newsweek, Time, Business Week, National Geographic, GEO, Der Spiegel, Figaro, Paris Match, The Telegraph, The Sunday Times Magazine, The Guardian, and Observer Magazine, among others. He covered the Bhopal disaster, the funeral of Indira Gandhi and aftermath of her assassination‚Äîthe Hindu-Sikh riots, the rise of the Khalistani movement, the political career of Rajiv Gandhi, the funeral of Mother Teresa, the cyclones in Bangladesh, the Nellie conflict in Assam, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid, which almost got him killed; among many other news stories. He was awarded the World Press Photo of the Year in 1985 for his now iconic image of a half-buried child victim of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. Photography career Bartholomew had his first photography lessons at home, in his father‚Äôs darkroom. ‚ÄúWhen we went to our summerhouse, I would be with him in the darkroom, looking at the images emerging in the developing tray. That was pure magic. He didn‚Äôt teach me anything specific about photography. What I took from him was the need to be a more sophisticated man‚Äîa Renaissance man, like him‚Äîwhom I‚Äôm not,‚Äù said Bartholomew in an interview with photography website, Invisible Photographer Asia. During his teenage years, he started photographing his family and friends and life on the streets, including the worlds of the marginalised rag pickers, sex workers, beggars, and eunuchs. He first exhibited photographs from this body of work at Art Heritage Gallery, New Delhi, in 1979, and at the Jehangir Art Gallery, Bombay, in 1980. In July 2007, Outside In: A Tale of Three Cities, a retrospective revisiting of the same archive of photographs from his teenage diary, shot in Bombay, Delhi, and Calcutta, was shown at Rencontres d‚ÄôArles. In 2008, the show travelled to the National Museum, New Delhi, the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai, Bodhi Art, New York, and in 2009, to Bodhi Berlin. The display of the series at Chobimela VII in Dhaka in January 2013 marked its 12th showing. He has held a number of fellowships, including one from the Asian Cultural Council, New York (1987), to photograph Indian immigrants in the USA, and one from the Institute of Comparative Studies in Human Culture, Norway (1995), to photograph the Naga tribes in India. Between 2001 and 2003 he ran a photography workshop for emerging photographers in India with the support of the World Press Photo Foundation in Amsterdam. Among his photo essays are \\"The Chinese in Calcutta,\\" \\"The Indians in America,\\" and \\"The Naga Tribes of Northeast India\\".

The first goat tower was built at Aveleda, a winery in Portugal's Vinho Verde region. Since 1981, several other goat towers have been built in South Africa, Norway, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Argentina; these include three at other wineries. The towers typically are multi-story with climbing ramps spiralling the exterior and often become tourist attractions.

Garden design ‚Äì Volume 18, Issue 5. 1999. \\"...Silva da Fonseca, began developing the gardens on a grander scale and building their architectural follies in the 1820s. These are painstakingly maintained today: a stone goat tower three stories high with a spiral ramp of logs...\\"Nic Barlow, Caroline Holmes. Follies of Europe: architectural extravaganzas . 2008 Page 180. Known as Torre das Cabras (Tower of the Goats), it was built by Fernando Guedes da Silva da Fonseca (1871‚Äì1946) at Aveleda, near Penafiel, one of the oldest wineries in the Vinho Verde region of Portugal.Aveleda website, http://www.aveleda.pt Penafiel: Quinta da Aveleda . Visao. 27 April 2009. The tower is three stories with stone walls and a rightward (climbing counter- clockwise) spiral wooden ramp and is one of several follies on the winery's estate for which their Follies label is named. Each of the follies, which in addition to the Torre das Cabras include the Manuelino-style Window, the Tea House, the Four Sisters Fountain, and the Guard House, is represented on one of the winery's labels. According to Francisco Guedes Almeida, a member of the 13th generation of the Guedes family to own the winery, the goat tower and the estate's other follies are \\"artistic daydreams with no functional explanation\\" built by various of his ancestors, one of whom \\"thought the goats did not belong to the plains ... so they built the goat tower, so they could have a mountain.\\" The tower symbolizes fertility and abundance. According to Almeida, he was travelling in South Africa and stumbled across another goat tower and called an uncle to tell him about it. His uncle told him, \\"You're in Fairview,\\" and related a story of a 1960s visit from a winemaker from South Africa's Fairview Winery who had seen the Aveleda goat tower, was inspired by it, and wrote to the Guedes family to ask permission to build one. Examples A goat tower in 200x200px Fairview built its goat tower in 1981, after the owner's son visited Aveleda and saw their tower.Erica Platter. A Strange Case of Wine . New Africa Books, 1993 p.79 describes the South African Goat Tower as one of a series of 'garden follies' based on European originals. The tower is used by the winery's herd of 750 Saanen, a breed of Swiss mountain goats. The tower is two stories and is built of brick and mortar. It has a steeply sloped metal roof and a wooden spiral ramp encircling the tower. It is a tourist attraction in the Cape Winelands area. The winery uses images of the tower and goats in their branding, producing a wine called Goats do Roam, a pun on C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne, and one called Goat Roti, a pun on C√¥te R√¥tie. The names were seen as a derogatory comment on the concept of terroir, which posits that unique environmental factors affect agricultural products such as grapes in ways that preclude calling two wines made from identical grapes grown in different areas by the same name. A 2004 story in Decanter magazine said the name had \\"irked France's terroir creator and protector, the INAO (Institut National des Appellations d‚ÄôOrigine)\\", who worry that \\"some Americans may not see the difference between the wines\\". The Fairview tower itself inspired others. In 1998, despite not owning any goats, Illinois farmers David and Marcia Johnson built a , goat tower in Shelby County, near Findlay, after seeing an article on the Fairview tower in the magazine Decanter.31 Ft. Goat Tower Keeps Animals Fit, Happy Farm Show Volume 33, Issue 2, 2009. The tower is constructed of 5000 hand-made bricks and has 276 steps made of concrete slabs reinforced with rebar. It has six stories. The Johnsons call their structure \\"The Tower of Baaa\\". In 2000, the Johnsons purchased 11 Saanen goats, and the tower is now used by their herd; Johnson says, \\"Goats are the most curious animals in the world so they use the tower a lot. They come and go, passing each other on the ramp.\\" The Johnsons' farm, now called Goat Tower Farm, has become a tourist attraction and has had visitors from as far away as Poland and Costa Rica. Cholmondeley Castle Gardens in Cheshire Ekeby, a dairy farm in Moss, Norway, owned by Finn-Erik Blakstad, built a tower based on the Fairview tower and uses images of it in their marketing of the farm's milk and cheese and the on-farm restaurant. Chef Elizabeth Holm, who runs the restaurant at Ekeby, has a tattoo of the goat tower over most of her back. In 2010, F√≠nca el Rocio, a goat farm in in Mendoza, Argentina, built a goat tower for their herd of Anglo-Nubian goats. The tower, which they call Torre de Cabras, was inspired by the Fairview winery and also built using the winery's plans. It has become a tourist attraction. Hampton Roads Winery in Surry, Virginia, claims to have built at tall the tallest goat tower in the world to house their herd of Nigerian Dwarf goats after reading about the Fairview tower. The winery has a range of wines named after the tower. Other examples include Cholmondeley Castle Gardens in Cheshire, UK, which has a goat tower for their herd of pygmy goats in the paddocks area and a goat tower built in the outdoor-seating area of Silky O'Sullivan's bar on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, where customers sometimes share their beer with the goats. In a Waunakee, Wisconsin, goat petting zoo, a steel goat tower built by the Endres Manufacturing Company was designed in a Bavarian style to match other buildings in the area. In 2019, the Maryland Zoo built a climbing structure for their herd of goats, calling it a \\"goat castle\\".  Reception  In 2014, Modern Farmer called goat towers \\"an idea whose time has come\\". Since at least 2009, the towers have been a viral meme.

Based on their use, they may be known as a barn, stables, or riding hall and may include commercial operations described by terms such as a boarding stable, livery yard, or livery stable. Larger facilities may be called equestrian centers and co-located with complementary services such as a riding school, farriers, vets, tack shops, or equipment repair. Horse accommodation A horse in a box, which allows freedom of movement Horses are often kept inside buildings known as barns or stables, which provide shelter for the animals. These buildings are normally subdivided to provide a separate stall or box for each horse, which prevents horses injuring each other, separates horses of different genders, allows for individual care regimens such as restricted or special feeding, and makes handling easier. The design of stables can vary widely, based on climate, building materials, historical period, and cultural styles of architecture. A wide range of building materials can be used, including masonry (bricks or stone), wood, and steel. Stables can range widely in size, from a small building to house only one or two animals, to facilities used at agricultural shows or at race tracks, which can house hundreds of animals. Terminology relating to horse accommodation differs between American and British English, with additional regional variations of terms. The term \\"stables\\" to describe the overall building is used in most major variants of English, but in American English (AmE) the singular form \\"stable\\" is also used to describe a building. In British English (BrE), the singular term \\"stable\\" refers only to a box for a single horse, while in the USA the term \\"box stall\\" or \\"stall\\" describes such an individual enclosure. Types of box A set of restricted movement stalls in an 18th-century stable In most stables, each horse is kept in a box or stall of its own. These are of two principal types: *Boxes allowing freedom of movement ‚Äì Horses are able to turn around, choose which way to face and lie down if they wish. These can also be known as a loose box (BrE), a stable (BrE), a stall (AmE) or box stall (AmE). *Stalls restricting movement ‚Äì These are known as a stall (BrE) or a tie stall (AmE). The horse is restricted in movement, can normally face only in one direction, and may or may not be able to lie down, depending on width and if or how tightly the animal is tied. They are usually restrained through being tied at one end of the stall by a rope to a halter or headcollar. Common dimensions are wide by long. The choice of type of box is likely to relate to the available space, local custom, welfare concerns, and workload of the horses. In some countries, local organisations give recommendations as to the minimum size of accommodation for a horse. For instance, in Britain, the British Horse Society recommends that horses be kept only in boxes which allow freedom of movement, and that these should measure a minimum of square for ponies, and square for horses. Common practice in the United States follows similar sizes. Stallions are sometimes kept in larger boxes, up to square, and mares about to foal or with foal at side are sometimes kept in a double-sized stall. Method of operation Stables can be maintained privately for an owner's own horses or operated as a public business where a fee is charged for keeping other people's horses. In some places, stables are run as riding schools, where horses are kept for the purpose of providing lessons for people learning to ride or even as a livery stable (US) or hireling yard (UK), where horses are loaned out for activities in exchange for money. When operated as a business where owners bring their horses to be boarded, they are known as \\"livery yards\\" (BrE) or \\"boarding stables\\" (AmE and Australian English). There are a number of arrangements that horse owners can make with operators of these stables. The least expensive is when the horse owner does all of the work related to the care of the horse themselves, called \\"do-it-yourself\\" (DIY) or \\"self-board\\". In the middle range, the term \\"full board\\" is used in the US to refer to several options, depending on the part of the country, from a facility that simply feeds the animals and possibly provides turnout, to one that handles all care of the horse, sometimes including exercise under saddle but not training per se. At the top end, the facility operator manages the entire care of the horse, including riding and training. In the UK, this is called \\"full livery\\". In the US, such settings may be called a \\"training stable\\". There are intermediate stages of care with parts of the care of the horse undertaken by each party, using terms such as \\"part livery\\" or \\"part board\\", with the terms not universal, even within individual countries, and usually agreed between owner and operator. Some stables also offer a service for horses to live on pasture only, without a space inside the stable buildings, known as \\"grass livery\\" (BrE), \\"agistment\\" (BrE), or \\"pasture board\\" (AmE). Where the stables also house a riding school or hireling operation, some operators may also offer a \\"working livery\\" (UK) or \\"partial lease\\" (US), where the horse owner pays a discounted rate (or no money at all) for their own horse's care in return for the riding school being able to offer the horse to paying customers other than the owner. A solid-walled round pen, used for schooling Schools, arenas and pens Horses are often exercised under human control, ridden or competed within designated fenced or enclosed places, usually called schools, pens or arenas. These can be of almost any size, provided they are sufficiently large for a horse to move freely, and can be located indoors or outdoors. The smallest are the round pen popular with natural horsemanship practitioners, which generally start at in diameter. Most arenas designed to allow more than one horse and rider pair to exercise safely at the same time are rectangular in shape and at the barest minimum are wide and at least long. The largest are commercial facilities designed for competitive events open to the general public with a performance space well over A riding academy or riding center is a school for instruction in equestrianism, or for hiring of horses for pleasure riding. Most feature a large indoor riding arena. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars large buildings were constructed for them, like Moscow Manege, Mikhailovsky and Konnogvardeisky maneges in St Petersburg. Grazing and open space Many horses are turned out in to fields to graze, exercise, or exhibit other natural behaviours, either on their own or more usually as part of a herd, where they may also engage in play activity and social bonding. The area where the horses are placed can be of any size, from a small pen with room to run, to wide areas covering thousands of square miles. In the United Kingdom this may range from open moorland without internal subdivision, down to small, fenced areas of grass, called pastures or paddocks in British English. A large turnout of several acres is a paddock in Australia, a pasture is significantly larger. In the United States, similar large spaces ranging from a few to many acres are called pastures or, for larger areas of public land or private unfenced ranch land approaching 100 acres or more, rangeland. Where the purpose of turning the horses out is to encourage activity and not for forage, for instance where a horse is stabled for a large portion of the day, or where additional forage is not desired, they may be turned out in to areas with no grass, to encourage activity and prevent grazing. In the USA, such spaces are called a paddock or, in the western United States, a corral, in the British Isles, a paddock, and in Australia, a pen.

This also could include a space such as a riding arena, doing double-duty as a turnout area. Equine nutritionists and management specialists also recommend a grassless area, which they sometimes call a \\"sacrifice area,\\" be fenced off from pastures intended for forage where horses can be placed when it is wet or muddy, to prevent the grass from being trampled, and during times of drought, to prevent or minimize overgrazing.

The song was released as the third single from the album in August 1973 and peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. The single reached the top of the Irish Singles Chart on 20 September 1973. The album version of the song is slightly longer than the single version. Most of the material cut for the single release is from the introduction where the lyric on the album \\"Humdrum days and a humdrum ways\\" is sung repeatedly. The single version of the song can be found on the compilation Greatest Hits ... And More (2006) The first real lines of the song are \\"Hey, kids, let me tell you how I met your mom. We were dancing and romancing at the senior prom\\". The epic poem Paradise Lost by John Milton is mentioned in the lyrics. The song is a parody of 1960s commercial pop music, notably of the Beach Boys where the line \\"And then I kissed her\\" is sung in a style similar to the band's 1967 hit single \\"Then I Kissed Her\\". \\"High School Confidential\\" by Jerry Lee Lewis was said to be an inspiration for part of this song. The song uses a number of American English expressions and Creme sings with a strong American accent. A 1974 performance of the song appears on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. The audio portion of a vintage mini-documentary chronicling the recording of the song in the studio was included in the limited edition 10cc box set \\"Tenology\\" in 2012. The single released in Germany featured an alternative picture sleeve with the \\"balloons and bomb\\" logo which had been used for the album.

Early careers  Producers Paul Crossley and Terry Owen were working with another South African group called Shiraz (band) during the mid-1980s. After the release of their first single, \\"Fighting For Our Lives\\", they were told by record executives that they were not willing to push the band further due to the lead singer's heavy South African accent. They were immediately looking for a new voice for their new project People Like Us. Then one night, while visiting the famous Johannesburg night-club Bella Napoli's, they heard the raspy and powerful vocals of Cindy Dickenson performing on stage and they knew they had found exactly what they were looking for. They soon recorded several songs in the studio, and released their first single \\"Midnight Lover\\" under the watchful eye of music executive Hilton Rosenthal who would later produce albums like 'Graceland' for Paul Simon and who was also the manager for South-African outfit Juluka and Savuka. Another important figure in the creative process was Giuseppe \\"Peps\\" Cotummuccio, a musician who was part of the group Syndicate with Cindy Dickenson at that time. Also of importance was co-writer, producer and mixer Bobby Summerfield, who currently has his own music company in LA www.summerfieldmusic.com, Summerfield Music, Inc. \\"Midnight Lover\\" received a good response from DJs on the club scene and opened the door for further expansion.  \\"Deliverance\\"  Then in 1987 their song \\"Deliverance' was released. This would be the song to make them well known in the clubs of Europe and all over the world where Hi-NRG and Euro disco songs were still the favourite music styles pumping out of the speakers. People did not at first know that People Like Us was a South African outfit and expected them to be from the UK due to the record company Passion who distributed their music was based there (The UK) and possibly due to the fear that the record buying public would not purchase anything that came from South Africa because of the country's Apartheid regime. In South Africa the songs was also a favourite in clubs and at house parties but records were only available through import and people only found out that they were South African at the height of \\"Deliverance\\"'s popularity. \\"Deliverance\\" caused quite a stir under some church leaders in pre-democratic ultra-conservative South Africa due to the song's lyrical content. The debut album was released titled 'Deliverance' and featured further tracks including \\"Hiroshima\\" (#28, 1987), \\"Restless Hearts\\" and \\"Reincarnation (Coming Back for Love)\\". Enquiries about People Like Us came from all over the world and a tour of the UK was launched. Then disaster struck when Paul Crossley fell gravely ill with AIDS at the height of their popularity. Paul Crossley died on 6 August 1989. His death had serious repercussions for People Like Us, as Paul Crossley was seen as the main driving force of the band and this dampened the future progression of the band. Subsequently, People Like Us covered the Shiraz song \\"Fighting For Our Lives\\", bringing homage to Crossley. During that period leading up to Crossley's death the situation between Cindy, Terry and Paul soured and Cindy decided not to be involved with future albums. Cindy also fell pregnant with her son Danny and performing and recording would take a back seat for the next couple of years.  \\"Resurrection\\"  During 1988 Terry Owen teamed up with another South African musical mastermind Robin Hogarth for the work on the next album. Hogarth would go on to win two Grammy Awards for his producing work in 2007 and 2008. Angie Gold who was known for her hit \\"Eat You Up\\" then became the new voice of People Like Us and recorded songs including \\"Resurrection\\" and \\"Two To Tango\\". She also recorded the ballad \\"Prayer For You\\" which was originally co-written by Cindy Dickenson. The later work of People Like Us could not live up to the original success of \\"Deliverance\\" and some might speculate it was because of the untimely death of Paul Crossley or the departure of Cindy Dickenson. Another reason might be the rapid change in dance music during that time especially in Europe from a Hi-NRG and Euro disco driven sound to the more American influenced House music style that would soon conquer the dance music world. Biography of Cindy Dickenson Cindy was born in the UK and received professional training from the age of ten as a soprano at The Manchester School of Music under Professor Campbell from BBC Radio. She worked with various bands all over the UK and also got involved with song writing. She came to visit her sister in South Africa and enjoyed it so much that she decided to stay. Whilst there she got an agent, which got her signed at RPM Records. She soon released a rock-orientated single \\"Love Stealer\\", which had on the B-side one of her own compositions, \\"You make me fee like a woman\\". With that song she won a Sarie Award (South African equivalent to the Grammies). The group Syndicate, with band member Peps Cotummaccio, approached her to join them and they were soon touring Cape Town for six months and also travelled to Italy, England, Greece, Portugal and Mexico for performances. They released the single \\"Don't Go into Town\\". She also travelled on the passenger cruise ship the QE2 as the singer for the Harry Bence Orchestra for six months, which travelled from the UK to America. Paul Crossley and Terry Owen then became involved with her on People Like Us and recorded several songs for which she received very little money and nothing was signed officially. Later after the initial success of People Like Us this would become one of the topics that would tore the relationships of the band to an irreconcilable situation. After the birth of her son Cindy took a break from the industry and later became involved with other projects including Strutt, with Denise Ostler and Helena Muir. Strutt recently also included a male singer David who came from Cindy's singing school Reach for the Stars Voice Training Academy.23, of which she is the director. Cindy Dickenson is currently living in Durban, South Africa where her husband is the radio DJ Dave Guselli on East Coast Radio.

It is old law, but is still often mentioned as an extreme example of to what extent a \\"subjective\\" duty of care (as opposed to an objective duty of care under the modern law, see Re D'Jan of London Ltd and s.174 Companies Act 2006) allowed directors to escape consequences of their negligence. The court held that there was no breach of duty of care for failing to attend bank meetings. It is unlikely in modern corporate law that this decision would be reached on the facts. Facts The Marquess of Bute as an infant of six months was installed in 1848 on the board of directors as \\"President\\" of the Cardiff Savings Bank, in effect inheriting the office from his father. The company was plunged into insolvency in 1886 when Lord Bute was 38 years old. He had been to a board meeting when he was 21, in 1868, and apparently signed the minutes. But he was generally ignorant of the company's affairs. The company went insolvent because the directors defrauded the company of large sums of money. The liquidator wanted Lord Bute to make a contribution for the losses. Judgment Stirling J held that the duty owed by Lord Bute was essentially to be determined by the knowledge and capability of the director himself. Lord Bute was not liable because he was entitled to rely on the other directors to have done their own jobs and there was no extra duty on him to oversee that..

Michael Whitney Freer (born 29 May 1960) is a British Conservative Party politician and former banker. He was first elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Finchley and Golders Green at the 2010 general election. Freer is a former leader of Barnet Council and a former councillor for the Church End and St Paul's wards in Finchley. Early life Mike Freer was born in Manchester on 29 May 1960. Part of his childhood was spent in council accommodation, which was then bought by his parents following the Conservative government's Right to Buy policy. He was state educated at the Chadderton Grammar School for Boys and subsequently at St Aidan's County High School (now Richard Rose Central Academy) in Carlisle. He read accountancy and business law at the University of Stirling but did not graduate with a degree. Freer worked for a number of fast-food chains, including Pizzaland, Pizza Hut and KFC, prior to a management career in the financial sector. Freer worked for Barclays Bank as an \\"Area Performance Manager\\". Local government Freer was first elected to Barnet Council in 1990 for the St. Paul's ward, winning the seat from Labour. However, he lost the seat back to Labour in 1994 and went on to lose in the East Finchley ward in 1998. He was re-elected to the council, for the Church End ward, in 2002. He was unanimously elected leader of the council by his party on 11 May 2006, replacing Brian Salinger as Conservative group leader, having previously been Salinger's deputy. Following the collapse of Icelandic banks Glitnir and Landsbanki in October 2008 in which Barnet Council had invested ¬£27.4m of council taxpayers' money, Freer was named Private Eye's \\"Banker of the Year\\" in its Rotten Borough Awards of 2008. The money was subsequently recovered.https://barnetportal.icasework.com/servlet/ep.getImg?ref=D858364&bin;=Y&auth;=0&db;=gAcEuIdf9lA%3D&hc;=b007159d07dd26d961bb28575329ee43 In 2009, Freer announced a new model of local government delivery for the London Borough of Barnet, called \\"Future Shape\\" which he stated could save Barnet Council ¬£24 million a year. The scheme has been dubbed easyCouncil because of its similarity to easyJet's business model. Parliamentary career In the 2005 general election, Freer contested the Harrow West constituency in the neighbouring borough of Harrow. He finished second to the Labour incumbent Gareth Thomas, whose majority was cut from 6,000 to 2,000. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Finchley and Golders Green at the 2010 general election, and was re-elected in 2015, 2017 and 2019. Positions Freer was made Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Transport following the 2015 election and served in this post until the 2017 election. On 15 June 2017, Freer was appointed by the Chief Whip Gavin Williamson to the Whips Office as Assistant Government Whip. He was later promoted to serve as a Lord Commissioner within the Whips Office in July 2018. In the House of Commons he has sat on the Work and Pensions Committee, the Scottish Affairs Committee and the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee. Views Freer is a member of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI). Although he is not Jewish, The Jewish Chronicle in 2008 ranked him 99th in its list of 100 most powerful influences on the Jewish community. In 2014, Freer resigned as parliamentary private secretary to Nick Boles in order to vote against a backbench motion recognising Palestine as a state alongside Israel, arguing \\"the two-state solution we all want to see should be the end not the start of the process\\". In January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes \\"fit for human habitation\\". According to Parliament's register of interests, Freer was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government had responded to the amendment that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it. Freer was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. He was a vocal defender of the Prime Minister Theresa May after she and the Conservative Party received criticism for her role in the Windrush scandal in 2018. After a constituent wrote to him complaining about the Conservative Party's role in the scandal, he responded that it was nothing to do with the party and that they should not believe 'misrepresentations' from the Labour Party. On 1 April 2019 Freer was one of fifteen Conservative MPs to vote in favour of a People's Vote - a second referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union. Other events In October 2011, Freer was the target of an attack at a constituency surgery in a mosque in his constituency of Finchley by members of Muslims Against Crusades. In October 2019, Freer hosted a crocus planting ceremony in memory of the 1.5 million children who perished in the Holocaust, which was attended by around 100 members of the local community. Chair of the local Labour party Matt Staples subsequently claimed that Freer had \\"politicised\\" the event by not inviting \\"representatives from across the political spectrum\\".https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/finchley-and-golders- green-mp-mike-freer-accused-of-politicising-holocaust-memorial-event-1.489707 Personal life Freer is gay, which he revealed to fellow MPs during a speech in the debates over the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. He lives with his Italian husband, Angelo Crolla, in Finchley, north London. He entered into a civil partnership in January 2007. On the eighth anniversary of their civil partnership, in January 2015, they converted it into a marriage.

It was M√©rault who built the present castle. Its design was formerly attributed to Fran√ßois Mansart without corroborating documentary evidence, but is now attributed to Nicolas de l'Espine.

He demolished the wall of the courtyard along the moat and put an ironwork gate with two lampholders in front of the bridge. He also modernised the interior decor, creating a little salon gros near the vestibule and the grand salon d'angle. In the 1780s, a water feature was added, with an island bordered by bald cypresses from Louisiana at its centre - it is traditionally attributed to the painter and garden designer Hubert Robert. After the French Revolution, Louis-Justin, marquis de Talaru, bought the estate under the Consulate and carried out repairs, redesigning the park '√† l'anglaise'. Mayor of Chamarande, he lived at the Ch√¢teau until his death in 1850. In 1852, the estate was sold to Pierre and Ren√© Robineau, and in 1857 it became the property of Victor Fialin, comte then duc de Persigny, interior minister to Napol√©on III and French ambassador to the United Kingdom. He created a luxuriously-furnished gallery on the ch√¢teau's ground floor, built a fortified wall round the estate, completed the transformation of the park into the \\"√† l'anglaise\\" style and planted exotic trees. New service buildings were added : a farm, stables, a bergerie, a birdhouse, a kennel, a new icehouse and a winter garden. Near the new gate was placed an obelisk inspired by the Songe de Poliphile, which probably referred to the love-affairs of Henry II with Diane de Poitiers. In 1862 (ten years before his death), Persigny held a f√™te at Chamarande for the birthday of empress Eug√©nie. In 1876, the ch√¢teau was acquired by Aristide Boucicaut, founder of Bon March√©, who added a Renaissance-style dining room but died only a year after purchasing the ch√¢teau. His widow took it with her when she remarried in 1881, to the doctor Marie-Joseph-Laurent Amodru, mayor of Chamarande until 1922 and d√©put√© for Seine-et-Oise. After 1913, the waterfall had copies of the river statues from the parc de Versailles added. From 1923 to 1951, the ch√¢teau was central to the creation of Scouting in France (the foundation of the regional heads of the Scouts et Guides de France is always called the Cham in reference to Chamarande). In 1950, the first √Ä c≈ìur joie festival took place at Chamarande, before becoming the Festival des Choralies at Vaison-la-Romaine. In 1957, the last private owner was Auguste Mione, president of \\"La Construction moderne fran√ßaise\\", before the estate was bought in 1978, by the General Council of the Essonne.  The estate today  The parc de Chamarande covers 98 hectares. The commanderie (i.e. les communs) has since 1999 been the main store for the Essonne department's archives. An eight-floor underground silo below the ch√¢teau's courtyard allows up to 32 km of shelving, of which 11 km are presently in use. In 2001, a contemporary art centre was set up at Chamarande at the instigation of Dominique March√®s, founder of the Vassivi√®re art centre. He was its first director, followed by Judith Quentel (2005 to present). It has a permanent collection (entitled L'esprit des lieux), bought with a fund of the Essonne department and including works by Lilian Bourgeat, Erik Samakh (\\"fl√ªtes solaires\\", in the park), Miguel Egana (Feuilles scies, 2001, in the park), Bert Theis (giant white crosses, in the park) and Philippe Ramette. The permanent sculpture park in the estate, plays off the existing features - the icehouse houses a sound installation by C√©leste Boursier-Mougenot, and the orangery presents monograph exhibitions dedicated to young artists : *2007 : **Sammy Engramer **David √âvrard *2008 : **Sylvain Rousseau In season, from May to October, the centre hosts story-telling, music, dance and film festivals as well as gardening and heritage events in the park.

The Manor of Sockburn was for many years in antiquity the home of the Conyers family, known, inter alia, for the legend of the Sockburn Worm. In the late 17th century the estate was purchased by the Blackett family. The present house was built to replace the old manor for the occupation of Henry Collingwood Blackett (third son of Sir William Blackett, 5th Baronet) in about 1834 in a neo Jacobean architecture, with three bays, two storeys and attics above and shaped gables. Following the death of Blackett's widow in 1877 the house was let out. It deteriorated during the 20th century and in recent times the current owners have begun a restoration project.

In 1928, Cott paid approximately $146,000 to have this building constructed. Architect Charles N. Agree designed the building. From 1928 - 1933, Cass Motor Sales sold Marmon Motor Car Company vehicles. After 1933, when Marmon went out of business, Cass again sold Chryslers. Richard A. Cott died in 1965, and in 1969 Cass Motor Sales ceased operations. The building was sold to Dalgleish Cadillac, who operated it until the dealership closed in 2010. In 2015 the building was renovated into first floor retail space now occupied by Carhartt's flagship store and office space above. Architecture The Cass Motor Sales is a three-story rectangular structure, typifying Art Deco architecture as applied to commercial buildings.

It was released in September 2009. Gameplay Spyborgs gameplay screenshot Spyborgs sees players controlling a member of a team of cyborg secret agents, each with their own unique abilities, through several levels populated by enemies. The game is designed to be played co-operatively with two players, though the AI will take control of the other character in single player games. Players can also gain experience points to upgrade their character's abilities. For each level, players can choose two out of the three Spyborgs, which include: *Clandestine, a quick and nimble female ninja. *Bouncer, a lumbering but powerful robot. *Stinger, a soldier with a cybernetic gun arm. Played using the Wii Remote, motion controls initiate special attacks while the two characters can team up their attacks for additional damage. Alternatively, players can also choose to play with the buttons on the Wii Remote instead. Plot Development Initially announced in June 2008 at Capcom's Captivate event, Spyborgs underwent a major redesign after a lukewarm reception from the gaming press. Changes include a shift from bright cartoony graphics reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoon shows, to a grittier and more realistic visual look, as well as the removal of minigames which served as parodies of children's toy commercials. The current game also shifted focus from an action-oriented game with superpower-based puzzle elements to a brawler. The game was developed in an internal engine designed by Bionic Games, not MT Framework. Reception Spyborgs received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the game for its high quality graphics and large amount of polish. Despite this, IGN criticised the title for its punishing difficulty and lack of innovation. Eurogamer criticised the game for being generic.

When he reached adolescence he joined his uncle, who was head of a maritime import‚Äìexport company at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and took over as head of the business on the cousin's death. He based his subsequent fortune not only on this company, but also on transatlantic trade (supplying the American colonies with basics, in return for far more financially interesting products such as tropical fruits, rare trees and slaves) and his sugar plantations on Saint-Domingue (Ha√Øti). His rapid rise, comparable to that of several bourgeois men of the age of Enlightenment, gained him promotion to noble rank and allowed him to acquire several estates. He became fermier g√©n√©ral (1759‚Äì1767) on the suggestion of his friend the duc de Choiseul. He took up residence in the ch√¢teau de La Fert√©-Vidame in 1764, the fief bringing with it the ancient title of Vidame de Chartres. He rebuilt it in the neoclassical style which now remains as a shell, and commissioned several artists. However, following a game of musical chairs, he lost it in 1784 to the duc de Penthi√®vre, who had himself lost his domaine de Rambouillet to king Louis XV, who coveted its \\"terres giboyeuses\\" or wooded hunting lands. Laborde was named marquis and in 1784 acquired the Ch√¢teau de M√©r√©ville, rebuilding it to his taste. In politics, he was ahead of his time and of the French Revolution, and (with Mirabeau) was one of the only noble d√©put√©s (from the bailliage d'√âtampes) to accept demotion to the Third Estate upon the Revolution. However, this was not enough to save him from being guillotined in Paris under the \\"loi des suspects\\" on the orders of Louis de Saint-Just, in one of the last fits of the Reign of Terror in May 1794. In 1792 much of the fabulous Orleans Collection of paintings was briefly his, before he was forced by events to abandon his ambition to exhibit them in his Paris house, and sold them.

She placed third on America's Next Top Model, Cycle 5. Early life Scullark was born in Harlem, New York. She began swimming competitively when she 9 years old, winning many medals. Scullark attended Catholic school throughout elementary and middle school. For high school she attended Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School for International Careers (Times Square vicinity). She was a student at Sullivan County Community College in upstate New York, where she studied international sales and interned at Vincent Nessi's showroom. Her first fashion show was The Juneteenth fashion show in NYC. America's Next Top Model Scullark was the fifth contestant selected for Cycle 5. She is perhaps best known for her raspy, sultry voice and spunky personality. Over her stay she won two challenges, was voted Covergirl of the Week twice and received one first call-out. Scullark was involved in a memorable argument with fellow contestant Nicole Linkletter when she accused Linkletter of stealing her granola bar, and retaliated by disposing of all of Linkletter's Red Bull energy drinks down the drain in the bathroom which Kim Stolz mediated and questioned Scullark if she was going to replace whatever she had taken away. Linkletter and Scullark refused to talk civilly until they reconciled during a day out in London when they were paired together, originally to their dismay. In 2011, Lisa D'Amato confessed that she had stolen the granola bar. Scullark was placed in the bottom two four times for (on each occasion) her inability to handle the cutthroat modelling industry, her potential to be high fashion rather than doing great at commercial, her unprofessional behavior at the photo-shoot and at panel (despite a very strong photo) and for not elongating her height in the Bollywood photo-shoot however she had survived over Diane Hernandez, Kyle Kavanagh, Kim Stolz and Jayla Rubinelli, respectively. Despite Scullark's strong improvement, she was eliminated in her fifth collective (also her third consecutive in London) bottom two appearance and placed third overall in the competition, as she was seen weaker than the other two competitors Nik Pace (who was the first selected finalist) and Nicole Linkletter who survived over Scullark and eventually won. Scullark appeared in episode four of Cycle 7 to critique the models on their walks and appeared in a Cycle 8 episode posing in a photograph with eventual winner Jaslene Gonzalez.

The term was applied to a group of objects that arise from a common axiomatization of certain structures and split into three families, which were introduced separately: M√∂bius planes, Laguerre planes, and Minkowski planes.W. Benz, Vorlesungen √ºber Geomerie der Algebren, Springer (1973) F. Buekenhout (ed.), Handbook of Incidence Geometry, Elsevier (1995)  M√∂bius plane  classical M√∂bius plane: 2d/3d model Starting from the real Euclidean plane and merging the set of lines with the set of circles to form a set of blocks results in an inhomogeneous incidence structure: three distinct points determine one block, but lines are distinguishable as a set of blocks that pairwise mutually intersect at one point without being tangent (or no points when parallel). Adding to the point set the new point \\\\infty, defined to lie on every line results in every block being determined by exactly three points, as well as the intersection of any two blocks following a uniform pattern (intersecting at two points, tangent or non-intersecting). This homogeneous geometry is called classical inversive geometry or a M√∂bius plane. The inhomogeneity of the description (lines, circles, new point) can be seen to be non-substantive by using a 3-dimensional model. Using a stereographic projection, the classical M√∂bius plane may be seen to be isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections (circles) on a sphere in Euclidean 3-space. Analogously to the (axiomatic) projective plane, an (axiomatic) M√∂bius plane defines an incidence structure. M√∂bius planes may similarly be constructed over fields other than the real numbers.  Laguerre plane classical Laguerre plane: 2d/3d-model Starting again from \\\\textstyle \\\\R^2 and taking the curves with equations y=ax^2+bx+c (parabolas and lines) as blocks, the following homogenization is effective: Add to the curve y=ax^2+bx+c the new point (\\\\infty,a). Hence the set of points is (\\\\R\\\\cup{\\\\infty})\\\\times\\\\R. This geometry of parabolas is called the classical Laguerre plane (Originally it was designed as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles. Both geometries are isomorphic.) As for the M√∂bius plane, there exists a 3-dimensional model: the geometry of the elliptic plane sections on an orthogonal cylinder (in \\\\R^3). An abstraction leads (analogously to the M√∂bius plane) to the axiomatic Laguerre plane. Minkowski plane classical Minkowski plane: 2d/3d-model Starting from \\\\R^2 and merging the lines y=mx+d, m e0 with the hyperbolas y=\\\\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c, a e0 in order to get the set of blocks, the following idea homogenizes the incidence structure: Add to any line the point (\\\\infty,\\\\infty) and to any hyperbola y=\\\\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c, a e0 the two points (b,\\\\infty), (\\\\infty,c). Hence the point set is (\\\\R\\\\cup{\\\\infty})^2. This geometry of the hyperbolas is called the classical Minkowski plane. Analogously to the classical M√∂bius and Laguerre planes, there exists a 3-dimensional model: The classical Minkowski plane is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a hyperboloid of one sheet (non degenerated quadric of index 2) in 3-dimensional projective space. Similar to the first two cases we get the (axiomatic) Minkowski plane. Planar circle geometries or Benz planes Because of the essential role of the circle (considered as the non-degenerate conic in a projective plane) and the plane description of the original models the three types of geometries are subsumed to planar circle geometries or in honor of Walter Benz, who considered these geometric structures from a common point of view, Benz planes.

Grove Music Online After vocal studies with Alberto Randegger and Jenny Lind, and composition studies with teachers including Hamish MacCunn, Lehmann made her singing debut in 1885 in London and pursued a concert career for nearly a decade. In 1894, she married and left the stage. She then concentrated on composing music, becoming known for song cycles, art songs, parlour songs and children's songs. She also composed several pieces for the stage and wrote a textbook on singing. In 1910, she toured the United States, where she accompanied her own songs in recitals. She was the first president of the Society of Women Musicians and became a professor of singing at the Guildhall School of Music in 1913. Biography She was born Elisabetha Nina Mary Frederica Lehmann in London.Baker, p. 1030 Her father was the German painter Rudolf Lehmann, and her mother was Amelia (A.L.) Chambers, a music teacher, composer and arranger. Lehmann \\"grew up in an intellectual and artistic atmosphere\\" and lived in Germany, France and Italy in her early years. She studied singing in London with both Alberto Randegger and Jenny Lind, and her composition teachers included Hamish MacCunn in London, Niels Raunkilde in Rome, and Wilhelm Freudenberg in Wiesbaden. On 23 November 1885, she made her singing debut at a Monday Popular Concert at St James's Hall, and spent the next nine years performing many important concert engagements in England. She received encouragement from important European musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Clara Schumann. She retired from the stage after a final concert at St James's Hall on 14 July 1894, married the composer and painter Herbert Bedford and turned to composing music. In 1910, Lehmann made a tour of the United States, where she accompanied her own songs in recitals. She became the first president of the Society of Women Musicians in 1911 and 1912. She was also a professor of singing at the Guildhall School of Music in 1913.Cohen, International Encyclopedia of Women Composers, v. I, p. 409 The same year, she wrote a voice study text, Practical Hints for Students of Singing. She had two sons; the older one died in training during the First World War, and the younger was the father of the conductor Steuart Bedford and the composer David Bedford.Banfield, Stephen. Norton/Grove Dictionary of Women Composers, p. 276 She completed her memoirs in 1918 and died, shortly after completing them, at Pinner, Middlesex, at the age of 56. She is buried in Highgate Cemetery. Music After her performing career ended in 1894, Lehmann concentrated on composing music for the rest of her life. She completed one of her best known works two years later, in 1896, the song cycle for four voices and piano titled In a Persian Garden, settings of selected quatrains from Edward FitzGerald's version of the RubƒÅiyƒÅt of Omar KhayyƒÅm. She composed many more song cycles including The Daisy Chain and an In Memoriam based on Alfred Lord Tennyson's love poem. She also became known for her art songs, parlour songs and other works in the following years. She wrote many children's songs, ranging from the sweet and trivial \\"There are fairies at the bottom of our garden\\" to the melodically and harmonically passionate \\"Stars\\" in The Daisy-Chain. Her tenor song \\"Ah, moon of my delight\\" from In a Persian Garden has been recorded through the years by tenors such as John McCormack, Jan Peerce, Mario Lanza, Robert White, and Webster BoothMany of these recordings are still available; see \\"Ah Moon Of My Delight Mp3 Play and download\\", mp3truck.net, accessed 21 February 2014 In 1904 she was commissioned by Frank Curzon to compose the score for the Edwardian musical comedy Sergeant Brue, with a libretto by Owen Hall and lyrics by James Hickory Wood. The piece was a success in London and New York, but Lehmann was unhappy that Curzon added other composers' music to her score. Although she refused to write any further musicals, Lehmann composed the score for a comic opera adaptation of The Vicar of Wakefield in 1906, with a libretto by Laurence Housman. This piece was a modest success but did not lead to further comic operas. In 1916, she returned to writing for the stage, with the score for the opera Everyman, which was produced by the Beecham Opera Company.\\"Liza Lehmannn\\", British Musical Theatre, 25 December 2003, accessed 14 February 2014 Lehmann, Ethel Smyth and Maude Val√©rie White were England's foremost female composers of songs at the beginning of the 20th century. Although they all composed solo settings of serious texts, Lehmann and White excelled in setting lighter material. Some of Lehmann's compositional practices, such as her frequent writing of four-voice cycles and writing piano links between songs, were consistent with her time. Although her pieces were inventive, they are now often overlooked and disregarded.

The site is available in over 30 languages and is used by 100 million people per month. The company lets people research and book travel options for their trips, including flights, hotels and car hire. Compared to other travel metasearch engines, the website counts a greater share of millennials among its users. History The company was formed in 2004 by three information technology professionals, Gareth Williams, Barry Smith, and Bonamy Grimes, after Gareth was frustrated by the difficulties of finding cheap flights to ski resorts. Skyscanner was first developed and released in 2002. In 2003, the first employee was hired to assist with site development. The Edinburgh office was opened in 2004. In 2008, Skyscanner received first round funding of ¬£2.5 million from venture capital firm Scottish Equity Partners (SEP). In 2009, the year after SEP invested in the business, Skyscanner reported its first profit. In 2011, Skyscanner acquired Zoombu. Skyscanner opened an office in Singapore in September 2011, which is headquarters for its Asia-Pacific operations. In 2012, a Beijing office was added, as Skyscanner began a partnership with Baidu, China's largest search engine. By 2013, the company employed over 180 people. In February 2013, Skyscanner announced plans to open a United States base in Miami. In October 2013, Sequoia Capital purchased an interest in Skyscanner that valued the company at $800 million. In June 2014, Skyscanner acquired Youbibi, a travel search engine company based in Shenzhen, China. In October 2014, Skyscanner acquired the Budapest-based mobile app developer Distinction. By February 2015, the company employed 600 people, double the employment of 18 months earlier. In January 2016, the company raised $192 million based on a $1.6 billion valuation for the company. In November 2016, Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip), the largest travel firm in China, bought Skyscanner for $1.75 billion. Following the sale to Ctrip, Skyscanner‚Äôs largest shareholder, SEP, completed its exit from the business. In 2017, Ctrip bought the Trip.com domain and launched Trip.com. The original platform was became a subsidiary of Skyscanner. In 2018, Skyscanner won the best travel app award by Tripzilla online travel magazine.

Company was a washing machine manufacturer founded by brothers A.W. and Silas Altorfer in Roanoke, Illinois, in 1909. The brothers first created a power clothes washer after watching their sisters and mother hand-washing piles of clothes. It was basically a wooden tub mounted to a bench with wooden \\"fingers\\" to wash the clothes, and attached to a gasoline engine. After two years, sales of the new power washer were in the thousands. They called the machine the Roanoke Power Machine. The company became known as the ABC Washer Company and its appliances were sold under the ABC brand. The company built a new factory in Peoria, Illinois, and the wooden tub was replaced with a metal tub. In 1926, ABC produced the first porcelain-lined tub. In 1928, ABC took over the Federal Washing Machine Company of Chicago, Illinois, which was producing washing machines for the Insull utilities company founded by Samuel Insull. ABC became Insull's supplier and made washing machines under the Fedelco brand exclusively for them. In the mid- nineteen thirties ABC introduced a spin dryer model which eliminated the wringer and added a spin dryer to the conventional washing model. In 1952, Altorfer Bros. Company was purchased by the Nash-Kelvinator company, and began manufacturing products under the Kelvinator brand as well.

The flotilla's mission is to provide heavily armed and fast patrol boat (called fast attack craft or FACs) capability to counter sea tiger movements along the coast and to protect naval and civilian shipping from sea tiger suicide crafts. History The flotilla was formed in the early 1980s with the Dvora class fast patrol boats to counter LTTE gun running in the Palk Strait from India. With escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War the Sea Tigers began to poss a threat to the patrol boats of the Navy, with use of small fibreglass boats armed with machine guns. The flotilla was used as the primary offensive unit to counter these boats. When the Sea Tigers started to use boats for suicide bomber attacks on ships the unit was used for defensive operations too, such as escorting larger naval ships and civilian ships in coastal waters off the norther and eastern provinces of the country. Able to reach speeds of 45konts these FACs operate in pairs to counter sea tiger wolf pack tactics and also to defend each other against small suicide crafts that try ram them. Armament Early Dvoras were armed with 2-3 machine guns as most patrol boats in other navies do. However, during the progress of the war the armament on board FACs were increased considerably due to the increase of arms carried on sea tiger boats that ranges from heavy anti aircraft machine guns to rocket launchers. Currently all FACs have Typhoon 25-30mm stabilized cannon are installed as their primary armament, which can be slaved to state- of the art mast-mounted, day and night all weather long range electro-optic systems. This enables FACs to locate and target sea tiger boats at a greater distance, in all weather at high speeds. Newer FACs, specially Colombo class series III FACs are equipped with Elop MSIS optronic director and Typhoon GFCS as its own weapons control system. Also these crafts use surface search: Furuno FR 8250 or Corden Mk 2; I-band as its radar. In addition to its main armament they carry additional weapon systems such as DS30 30mm twin gun, Oerlikon 30 mm twin cannon, Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, automatic grenade launchers, Type 80 machine guns, W85 heavy machine gun & Type 63 MRLS, including 12.7 mm and 7.62 mm machine guns. These act as both offensive and point defense weapons to protect the FAC from suicide crafts, by destroying them before they could ram or explode close to the FAC. Therefore, compared with similar patrol boats of other navies, Sri Lanka Navy FACs are more heavily armed and faster. Organization The flotilla is based at SLN Dockyard, Trincomalee, however boats operate out of all major harbors. Individual units come under the direct command of the Flag officer commanding that particular naval area it is assigned to.

History The original Whittington station was opened by the Midland Railway in 1861 to serve Old Whittington. The station was on the North Midland Railway's \\"Old Road\\" between Chesterfield and Rotherham Masborough. The line opened in 1840 and became very busy with coal and steel traffic with a number of new branches. In 1870 the Midland opened the \\"New Road\\" through Sheffield from Tapton Junction just north of Chesterfield, diverting passenger expresses away from the Old Road. The line through Whittington remained busy with local passengers, particularly with the rapidly expanding industry. The original station was replaced with a station further north in 1873. This 1873 station was the final Whittington station in the area. The buildings were constructed of timber, as was the signal box, with loops to each line. For a period around 1938 there was a wagon works nearby, with a small siding. The last regular passenger trains called on 4 February 1952, though it was used for excursions and special trains until 1967. Passenger services In 1922 passenger services calling at Whittington were at their most intensive, with trains serving four destinations via five overlapping routes: * On Sundays only ** stopping trains plied directly between and Chesterfield (MR) via the Old Road. * On Mondays to Saturdays three stopping services plied between Sheffield (MR) and Chesterfield ** most ran direct down the \\"New Road\\" through and went nowhere near Whittington. * the other two services went the \\"long way round\\" via the \\"Old Road\\".

The son of Robert de Scales, 5th Baron Scales (c. 1372‚Äì1402), he succeeded his brother Robert de Scales, 6th Baron Scales (died July 1419) as baron. Thomas distinguished himself in France, against Jack Cade and in many other places. He was rewarded with a grant of ¬£100 a year during his life and the privilege of a 200 tonne ship to transport goods wherever he saw fit (excluding Calais). He was summoned to Parliament from 1445 to 1460. Scales was an important man of considerable wealth. This is alluded to in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3: King Edward IV's brothers George and Richard complain to Edward about his bestowal of Scales' heiress (one of the wealthiest in England) on his Queen's brother, instead of one of them. Family Thomas Scales was born on 9 October 1399 at Middleton, Norfolk, and was baptized there. He was the second son of Robert de Scales, 5th Baron Scales (c. 1372‚Äì1402), and Elizabeth Bardolf (d. 1441), daughter of William Bardolf, 4th Baron Bardolf. Thomas inherited the barony of Scales after the death of his brother Robert, 6th Lord Scales (1397‚Äì1419). Military commander Cannons abandoned by Thomas Scales at Mont Saint-Michel In 1422, Scales crossed the Channel to Normandy, and served as a lieutenant of John, Duke of Bedford. By 1423, Scales was captain of Verneuil. From 1424 to 1425, he fought alongside John Fastolf to recapture the fortress at Maine. He was captured at the Battle of Patay in 1429 and later ransomed. According to a recruitment roll now at the National Army Museum, he commanded a corps of 728 archers (some with fire-tipped arrows) and about 50 infantry at the siege of Saint-Denis. In 1439, to cut off Mont-Saint-Michel, at the end of the French bridge in English-held territory, he founded the citadel of Granville. In 1442 Granville was taken by surprise by the French defenders of the Mont. In the Wars of the Roses Scales fought for Lancaster, and as such appears in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 2. On 25 July 1460 Scales was murdered,Philip Morant, The History and Antiquities of the County of Essex having, as commander of the Tower of London, turned its weapons against the city which was supporting the Yorkist Earl of Salisbury in besieging the Tower.

History The station was originally opened as \\"Staveley\\" in 1841, a year after the opening of the North Midland Railway. It was designed to serve the village of Staveley and the substantial ironworks near the station. Allen's guide of 1842 writes of \\"Staveley upon the hill to the left ; Mr. Barrow's iron-works in the valley.\\" The station on what became known as the \\"Old Road\\" between Chesterfield and Rotherham Masborough. It was in an area undergoing rapid industrialisation. Iron working had been carried on for many centuries and Staveley works itself had been opened in 1702. The land originally had been owned by the Duke of Devonshire but the copyhold had been bought by Richard Barrow in 1840. Whites Gazetteer, in 1857, records \\"Staveley Works, 1 mile E. from Staveley, is an ancient iron smelting establishment; there are documents in existence proving it to have been a place of considerable importance centuries ago, but its early history will not bear any comparison with the vastness of operations in the present day. Here are the collieries and extensive ironworks of Richard Barrow, Esq., with blast furnaces, producing 200 tons of metal weekly. Castings and foundry work of all kinds are executed at this extensive establishment. Neat residences for the clerks and overlookers have been built in the vicinity, besides a great number of cottages.\\"White's Gazetteer of Derbyshire 1857: via openlibrary Local ore had been worked out by 1870, but the works continued to expand, bringing increasing work for the railway. The station was moved and rebuilt in 1888 in a new position when the Clowne Branch was opened. There were three platforms, two on the main line and one for the branch, with typical Midland buildings, some in brick others of timber. In 1870, a large locomotive shed was opened, known as Staveley (Barrow Hill) Depot, coded 18D by the LMS and renumbered 41E in 1958. It included a 24 \\"road\\" (track) roundhouse. It closed in 1991, but has been preserved and reopened in 1998 as Barrow Hill Roundhouse & Railway Centre. In 1900, the station was renamed \\"Barrow Hill and Staveley Works\\". It was renamed again by British Railways in 1951, becoming plain Barrow Hill. The station closed to regular passenger traffic in 1954 but remained in place for many years. On 26 September 1971, it was used for a shuttle service from Chesterfield in connection with an open day at Barrow Hill engine shed. It remained in use for special services until at least 1981.Private and Untimetable Railway Stations by G. Croughton p. 44 Modern traffic At 22 June 2013 the line is part of the Midland Main Line.

It is hoped that someone will invest in this infrastructure to create road-rail interchange facilities. The trackbed of the Clowne Branch from Seymour Junction has been protected as it, too, might provide access to Markham Vale from a different direction. Furthermore, the trackbed of the Oxcroft Branch off the Clowne Branch east of Seymour Junction has been protected as there remains the possibility of opencasting in the area.

Historical In some old versions of chess, for example \\"Baring chess\\",Hooper & Whyld (1996), p. 29. bare king.Pritchard (2007), p. 81. Baring the king., as well as the game of shatranj, leaving the opponent with a bare king was one way of winning the game (see Checkmate#History). The relative weakness of the pieces in shatranj may have made this form of a win desirable. A possible exception to the bare king rule was if the king immediately after being bared was able to recapture, leaving the opponent with a bare king as well. This situation, called a \\"Medinese victory\\", was often considered a draw.Hooper & Whyld (1996), p. 256. Medinese victory. Contemporary Under modern rules, a player with a bare king does not automatically lose and may continue playing. A bare king can never give check, however, and can therefore never deliver a checkmate or win the game. A bare king can in some situations play to a draw, such as by stalemate or if the opponent of a bare king oversteps the time limit.6.10 in FIDE's Laws of Chess states that overstepping the time limit results in a loss, \\"However, the game is drawn, if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves, even with the most unskilled counterplay.\\" If both players are left with a bare king, the game is immediately drawn. Similarly, if one player has only a king and bishop or knight while the opponent has a bare king, the game is immediately drawn.1.3 in FIDE's Laws of Chess states \\"If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.\\" A quote attributed to Mikhail Tal claims that a game in the 1959 Zurich tournament between Bobby Fischer and Gideon Barcza finished with bare kings, but this is not supported by the published score of the game in chess books and databases.

The use of form liners often results in more attractive walls for highways, neighborhoods, beaches and parks. Form liners come in many different shapes and designs, and can produce a variety of different results on concrete. The process typically begins with a determination that an aesthetically interesting barrier is needed. Then concept drawings are made by the design team and presented for approval. Once the design is accepted by the surrounding neighborhood and building team, the drawings evolve into sculptured creations. The sculptor can create the original work using a variety of mediums, such as clay, polyurethane and wax. When the masterwork is finished, a cast is made using synthetic liquid rubber, and from this cast, form liners are produced in the reverse image of the original. A form liner panel is placed on the inside of a concrete forming system before the concrete has been poured and acts as a mold for the concrete to be formed against. Once the concrete has set, the forming system can be removed and the form liner can be stripped from the hardened concrete surface. The resulting concrete surface is permanently textured with the pattern of the form liner.  Types  There are several different types of form liners, which vary based on the application. Single-use form liners are usually made of styrene plastic and are normally discarded after the first use. Multi-use form liners are usually made of ABS plastic and range in number of uses from 2 to 10 or more. Multiple-reuse form liners are usually made of polyurethane, a heavy rubber material known for its reusability and used frequently by departments of transportation on sound walls, bridges and other applications. Other form liner materials used can include polystyrene foam, fiberglass, and even aluminum-- styrene plastic, ABS plastic, and urethane are considered to be the industry standard, and are most often specified in plans by architects and engineers. The form liners are attached to forms and concrete is placed against the liner. The liner pattern is transferred into the wet concrete. After the concrete has cured, the liner is stripped and the unique sculpture is exposed.  Origins  Architectural elastomeric urethane form liners were pioneered in 1968 at RECKLI GmbH, Herne Germany. The inception of form liners began with fairly simple images for concrete, including cut-out shapes and silhouettes resting on a background texture. As time passed, these designs grew in complexity, and creative artists and sculptors began to work with form liner manufactures to produce and design anything imaginable in concrete walls, and on a grand scale. Form liner textures were popularized in the early 1970s with graphic inlays. In 1972, form liner manufacturers created a fluted form liner with graphic inlays of shrimp boats, a famous crawfish wrapped around an oil bearing, tug boats and race boats. This sound/retaining wall, located in Morgan City, LA, was to be the first use ever of graphic inlays in form liner.

They performed as members of 1960s Australian rock group the Easybeats where Vanda was their lead guitarist and backing singer and Young was their rhythm guitarist and backing singer. Vanda & Young co-wrote most of the Easybeats' later hits including their international hit \\"Friday on My Mind\\" and they were the record producers for the group from 1967. Young was the older brother of Malcolm and Angus Young of the hard rock band AC/DC and also the record producer behind several of the band's biggest albums (such as 1976's Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap). The \\"Guitar George\\" and \\"Harry\\" who are mentioned in the Dire Straits hit song \\"Sultans of Swing\\" are George Young and Harry Vanda. After the Easybeats disbanded in 1969, Vanda & Young were songwriters and producers for their own projects such as the Marcus Hook Roll Band (EMI), Paintbox (Youngblood) and Haffey's Whiskey Sour (Deram), Flash and the Pan, and for other acts including producing early albums for AC/DC; they were staff producers for Albert Productions from 1973. In 1988 the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) acknowledged the iconic status of Vanda & Young when they were inducted into the inaugural Hall of Fame; in 2005 the Easybeats were also inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) surveyed 100 music industry personalities for the APRA Top Ten Best Australian Songs of All Time where \\"Friday on My Mind\\" was declared No. 1. Their song for John Paul Young, \\"Love Is in the Air\\", was declared the 'Most played Australian song overseas' by APRA following its use on the 1992 film Strictly Ballroom. 1964‚Äì1969: The Easybeats The Vandenbergs and Youngs migrated to Australia in 1963; both families were initially housed at the Villawood Migrant Hostel in Sydney. At the hostel five migrants formed the Easybeats: Stevie Wright (lead vocals), Dick Diamonde (bass), Gordon Fleet (drums), Vanda (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Young (rhythm guitar, backing vocals). Wright was their initial lyricist with Young composing the music as Vanda's grasp of English was insufficient. They were signed by EMI/Parlophone Records with Ted Albert producing their early recordings. By 1966 Vanda & Young had begun their writing partnership; together they penned the Easybeats' late 1960s recordings including \\"Friday on My Mind\\" which reached No. 1 on the Australian singles charts in 1966 and \\"Good Times\\" (1968). The Easybeats became Australia's most popular and successful 1960s group. They travelled to the UK on 10 July 1966 where \\"Friday on My Mind\\" was produced by Shel Talmy in November. They toured Australia in May 1967 and the USA in August to promote their later singles and albums. At this time Vanda & Young were producing their recordings; by late 1969 the group returned to Australia and disbanded. 1970‚Äì1973: Based in UK Vanda & Young returned to the UK and continued their writing and performing partnership. They recorded tracks under various names: Paintbox \\"Get Ready For Love\\" (1970), Tramp \\"Vietnam Rose\\" (1970) and Eddie Avana \\"Children\\" (1970) all on Youngblood Records; Moondance \\"Lazy River\\" (1970, A&M; Records - which peaked at number 42 in Australia, their only charting single), Grapefruit \\"Sha-Sha\\" (1971, Deram Records), Haffy's Whiskey Sour \\"Shot in the Head\\" (1971, Deram) and Band of Hope \\"Working Class People\\" (1972, unreleased). Grapefruit had included Young's elder brother Alex Young (aka George Alexander). In 1972 Vanda & Young formed Marcus Hook Roll Band and recorded the singles \\"Natural Man\\", \\"Louisiana Lady\\" and \\"Can't Stand the Heat\\" in London's Abbey Road Studio during 1973 using Ian Campbell on bass, Freddie Smith on drums and Alex Young on saxophone. These tracks would later appear on the album Tales of Old Grand-Daddy released in 1974 on EMI. 1973‚Äì1978: Return to Australia and AC/DC Vanda & Young returned to Australia in 1973 and were reunited with Ted Albert, who had established Albert Productions under EMI Records. Recently formed AC/DC's band members, and George Young's brothers, Malcolm and Angus Young joined the Marcus Hook Roll Band project on guitars to complete Tales of Old Grand-Daddy with John Proud on drums. In late 1974 Vanda & Young produced AC/DC's single \\"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\". They also produced early albums for AC/DC including High Voltage and TNT (both 1975), Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976), Let There Be Rock (1977), Powerage and If You Want Blood You've Got It (both 1978). As house producers for Albert Productions record label, they also wrote for and/or produced many Australian chart-topping acts including Stevie Wright (ex-the Easybeats) with the no. 1 single \\"Evie\\", Ted Mulry, Rose Tattoo, Cheetah, William Shakespeare, Mark Williams, and the Angels. Vanda & Young also wrote and produced several hits for John Paul Young including \\"Standing in the Rain\\", \\"I Hate the Music\\", \\"Love Is in the Air\\" and \\"Yesterday's Hero\\", which was also a cover version hit when recorded by Bay City Rollers. 1977‚Äì1992: Flash and the Pan Vanda & Young recorded several Australian hit singles under the studio-only pseudonym of Flash and the Pan, including \\"Hey St. Peter\\" (1977) and \\"Down Among the Dead Men\\" (1978). They had more success in Europe with hits \\"Waiting for a Train\\" (1983), \\"Midnight Man\\" (1984), \\"Early Morning Wake Up Call\\" (1985), and \\"Ayla\\" (1987), from the number 1 albums Headlines (1982), Early Morning Wake Up Call (1985) and Nights in France (1987). Singer-model-actress Grace Jones, in 1981, recorded a cover version of their song \\"Walking in the Rain\\". 1992‚Äìcurrent Vanda & Young helped compose rock artist Meat Loaf's \\"Runnin' for the Red Light (I Gotta Life)\\", which was released in 1995 as the third single from the album Welcome to the Neighborhood. While the single failed to meet expectations, the parent album itself did well, hitting #17 on the Billboard 200. Young produced AC/DC's 2000 album Stiff Upper Lip. Released by East West Records, it proved an international success, being RIAA certified as platinum in the United States. Vanda left his longtime partnership with Albert Productions in 2005 and started Flashpoint Music as a private recording studio. Young died on 22 October 2017.

Built in Italy by GEM (Galanti Electro Musical) under license by Jennings Musical Instruments from 1966 to 1967, and then by EME until 1971, it was a budget model visually based on the very popular Vox Continental. It had a single manual of four octaves (49 keys) and was built into the Continental's cabinet. Its technology was far less intricate, but the Jaguar still managed to produce a decent combo organ sound. It featured rocker switch tabs in place of the Continental's drawbars, and the first 12 notes were a \\"reversible\\" bass octave (\\"Walk\\" Bass/\\"Chord\\" Bass) with typical black-on-white keys. The main keyboard, like the Continental's, was white-on-black. It also featured a separate output for the bass notes, allowing a separate connection into a bass amplifier for \\"stereo\\" playing. At introduction, while the Jaguar featured only an \\"Off/On/Bass Volume\\" knob in addition to the tabs, its sibling model the \\"Corinthian\\" additionally featured a \\"Contour\\" (tone) knob. In 1968, the \\"Corinthian\\" name was dropped, and the latter instrument became the Jaguar (the original Jaguar being dropped from production). Some enthusiasts and players appear to be less impressed with the Jaguar's general quality in comparison to that of the Continental, though many agree that, for the money, it was a reasonably cost-effective substitute, and is still one of the better known vintage combo organ models. The Jaguar was not a particularly sturdy instrument, and its best recommended usage was for garage-bands, playing in small clubs, private parties, or the home studio. It was not considered suitable for heavy professional gigging. Heathkit offered a version of the Vox Jaguar for assembly by the purchaser in 1968.

It started out as a supporter of left wing and feminist causes and the mouthpiece of the feminist Six Point Group. Marina Camboni, Networking Women: Subjects, Places, Links Europe- America : Towards a Re-writing of Cultural History, 1890-1939. 2002. Storia e Letteratura, 2004 (p. 234-5) It later moved to the right along with the views of its owner. It always supported and published literary talent. The first editor was Helen Archdale. Lady Rhondda took over herself as editor in 1926 and remained for the rest of her life. Contributors included, Nancy Astor, Margaret Bondfield, Vera Brittain, John Brophy, Margery Corbett-Ashby, Anthony Cronin (literary editor mid-1950s), E.M. Delafield, Charlotte Despard, Crystal Eastman, Leonora Eyles, Emma Goldman, Robert Graves, Graham Greene, Charlotte Haldane, Mary Hamilton, J. M.

Chesterton, George Orwell, Emmeline Pankhurst, Eleanor Rathbone, Elizabeth Robins, Olive Schreiner, George Bernard Shaw, Ethel Smyth, Helena Swanwick, Ernst Toller, Rebecca West, Ellen Wilkinson, Charles Williams, Margaret Wintringham, and Virginia Woolf. In 1940, the article \\"The Necessity of Chivalry\\" by C.S. Lewis was published in Time and Tide, beginning an association between Lewis and the magazine that would last twenty years and include more articles and reviews. In 1944, Lewis's articles, \\"Democratic Education\\" and \\"The Parthenon and the Optative\\" were published, while \\"Hedonics\\" appeared in 1945. In 1946, the magazine published Lewis's articles \\"Different Tastes in Literature\\" and \\"Period Criticism\\". In 1954, Lewis published one of the first reviews of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, and in 1955 his reviews of The Two Towers and The Return of the King were published. Lewis also frequently contributed poetry to Time and Tide, including his poem \\"The Meteorite\\" (7 December 1946) which he used as the motto for his book Miracles (1947). Another significant contributor was Lewis's friend and fellow Oxford 'Inkling' Charles Williams, who contributed regularly from 1937 until his death in 1945. His important articles included a review of the 'B' text of W.B. Yeats's A Vision (1937) and an exposition of his own Arthurian sequence of poems, Taliessin Through Logres (1938). Time and Tide never sold well; its peak circulation was 14,000 copies. It is estimated that the magazine was subsidised by Lady Rhondda to the sum of ¬£500,000 during the thirty-eight years she owned it. In 1956, Time and Tide and Andr√© Deutsch published a hardbound book anthology of favourite writings titled Time & Tide Anthology, with an introduction by Lady Rhondda and edited by Anthony Lejeune. With Lady Rhondda's death in 1958, it passed to the control of Rev Timothy Beaumont and editor John Thompson in March 1960. Under their supervision it became a political news-magazine with a Christian flavour during the 1960s. It however continued to lose ¬£600 a week and, in June 1962, he sold it to Brittain Publishing Company where it was continued by W. J. Brittain. It became a monthly in 1970 and closed in 1979. The Time and Tide title was later purchased by Sidgwick and Jackson, a subsidiary of the hotel group Trust House Forte. They continued to publish it quarterly during 1984 - 1986 from their global headquarters in London with Alexander Chancellor as editor. Again it was propped-up by a very wealthy peer, Lord Forte of Ripley. References *The political magazine Time and Tide Description at Spartacus Educational. 5 August 2002.

Present were the Russian and Austro-Hungarian emperors together with their foreign ministers, Prince Gorchakov of Russia and Count Andrassy of Austria-Hungary. The closed meeting took place on July 8 in the Bohemian city of Reichstadt (now Z√°kupy). They agreed on a common approach to the solution of the Eastern question, due to the unrest in the Ottoman Empire and the interests of the two major powers in the Balkans. They discussed the likely Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, its possible outcomes and what should happen under each scenario. The later Budapest Convention of 1877 confirmed the main points, but when the war concluded with the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878, the terms of the treaty were quite different leading to Austrian insistence on convening a revision at the Congress of Berlin later that year. These events laid the background for the subsequent Bulgarian Crisis of 1885-1888, and ultimately World War I.Mikulas Fabry. The Idea of National Self-Determination and The Recognition of New States at The Congress Of Berlin (1878) . ISA Annual Convention, New Orleans, March 24-27, 2002  Format  The negotiations took place in a private and almost informal setting. It is significant that the results of the meeting were not written down, so that the Austrian and Russian view of what was agreed on differed significantly. There was neither a signed formal convention nor even a signed protocol. The minutes were dictated separately by both Andrassy and by Gorchakov suggesting that neither side really trusted the other side. The extent of agreed Austrian annexation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has remained controversial. It was these inconsistencies that necessitated further discussions at the Constantinople Conference and the subsequent Budapest Convention, though these largely confirmed or amended the Reichstadt discussions.  Terms of the agreement  The Balkan Christians would gain a measure of independence. Austria would allow Russia to make gains in Bessarabia and the Caucasus. Russia would allow Austria to gain Bosnia. Russia and Austria agree not to create a big Slavic state in the Balkans.  Implications  This effectively meant that Austria was assuring Russia that to stay out of a war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It also meant that the Austrians and the Russians were agreeing on how the Balkans would be split up in the case of a Russian victory. image:Andr√°ssy Gyula 1871.jpgAndrassy image:Franz Joseph 1865.jpgFranz Joseph image:Alexander II 1870 by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky.jpgAlexander II. image:A.M.Gorchakov.jpgGorchakov  See also  * History of Austria * Bulgarian Crisis (1885‚Äì1888)  References   Bibliography  * Crampton, R.

Directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, it was the first Tarzan film released in color, Eastman Color. It was also MGM's first Tarzan film since 1942 and filmed in Nairobi, British East Africa. The character of Jane does not appear in this motion picture. Plot An airplane crashes in the jungle of the Kenya Colony of British East Africa in 1956, stranding passengers Gamage Dean (Yolande Donlan), Diana Penrod (Betta St. John), \\"Doodles\\" Fletcher (Wilfrid Hyde-White), Carl Kraski (George Coulouris), and Dick Penrod (Peter Arne). Before the plane slides into a gorge the group is rescued by Tarzan (Gordon Scott), who undertakes to lead them back to civilization. Diana is kidnapped by warriors from Opar under Chief Ogonooro (Orlando Martins). The Oparians desire the strangers as sacrifices for their lion god. She is recovered by Tarzan and hunter Tusker Hawkins (Robert Beatty), whose advances Diana rebuffs. Secretly, however, Hawkins is in league with the Oparians, and plans to sell the castaways to the natives for a fortune in ivory. Tarzan, rightly suspecting Hawkins' untrustworthiness, exposes his treachery. Now openly in league with the natives, the hunter helps them take the white party captive in Tarzan's absence. The ape man returns to save them before the sacrifice can take place, aided by his chimpanzee ally Cheeta, who sets fire to the native village. He then leads them to the safety of a nearby settlement. Hawkins meets his fate at the hands of the Oparians, to whom Tarzan has signaled the villain's double-dealing by a creative use of jungle drums. Cast * Gordon Scott as Tarzan * Robert Beatty as Tusker Hawkins * Yolande Donlan as Gamage Dean * Betta St. John as Diana Penrod * Wilfrid Hyde-White as 'Doodles' Fletcher (as Wilfrid Hyde White) * George Coulouris as Carl Kraski * Peter Arne as Dick Penrod * Orlando Martins as Oparian Chieftain Ogonoore Notes The film contains more echoes of the original Burroughs novels than usual in a Tarzan movie of the period, including the ape man's brief account to the female lead of his origin (which echoes Burroughs' version), and the use of Opar, though reducing the romantic lost city described by Burroughs to a generic native village. Tarzan, while retaining his then-customary film characterization as an inarticulate simpleton, nevertheless displays considerable shrewdness and resource, foreshadowing the restoration in later movies of Burroughs' original concept of an intelligent, multitalented ape man. Reception According to MGM records the film earned $915,000 in the US and Canada and $1.4 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $432,000.

Vennemann was born in Dorsten, North Rhine-Westphalia, in 1977. He began writing short fiction while studying comparative literature at Cologne University. However, he made no effort to publish his stories until he had enough for a collection, which he then took to the small Cologne publisher Tropen Verlag, which immediately published the collection as Wolfskinderringe. It got little attention, and Vennemann went on to study history and American and Scandinavian Studies at colleges and universities in Vienna, Innsbruck, and Berlin before completing his first novel, Close to Jedenew. Unusual in being a consideration of the Holocaust at a time when young German writers had generally ceased such discussion, it was an immediate sensation and drew critical praise, leading to its subsequent publication across the continent by some of Europe's leading publishing houses.

The commune is located in western Quinchao Island while the eastern part is administered by the commune of Quinchao. History Curaco is proud of its association with several famous Chilean sailors. From the War of the Pacific are Admiral Galvarino Riveros and Rear Admiral Manuel Oyarz√∫n. Also remembered is Carlos Miller Norton navigator of the Goleta Ancud that took possession of the Straights of Magellan in 1843 for Chile. Hydrographer and explorer Francisco Hudson was also native to the town. It is said that Galvarino Riveros C√°rdenas was born in Chang√ºitad. In his career he cruised the entire coastline of Chile caring out many delicate and important missions. The nation could not have found a more suitable commander than Riveros to defend the country in the War of the Pacific (1879). On 13 and 15 January 1881, in command of his squadron, Riveros provided protective fire for the army assault that defeated the Peruvian forces leading to the surrender of Lima and Callao. The unaffected lives of Almirante Galvarino Riveros and Rear Admiral Manuel Oyarz√∫n, architects of Chilean victory in the War of the Pacific remain a lesson to each succeeding generation of Chileans. Curaco de V√©lez Architecture In 1660 the Jesuits noted simple dwellings here. The first haphazard buildings were of timber and straw. By 1724 the population was 262 made up of 33 families. By the beginning of the 20th century it had not grown much and the settlement was small and poor without streets or landing places. In 1901 Bishop Ram√≥n Angel Jara created the parish and took up the task of giving it a structure that would allow for future growth. One of the attractions for a visitor is the characteristic vernacular architecture of Chilo√© that makes good use of features such as balconies and lookouts that create an air of simplicity and originality. Churches dating from the 18th and 19th century reflect a strong faith. These are constructed of timber from the noble alerce and cypress trees. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Curaco de V√©lez spans an area of and has 3,403 inhabitants (1,642 men and 1,761 women), making the commune an entirely rural area. The population grew by 12.6% (382 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Curaco de V√©lez is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Luis Curumilla Sotomayor (PDC). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Curaco de V√©lez is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Gabriel Ascencio (PDC) and Alejandro Santana (RN) as part of the 58th electoral district, (together with Castro, Ancud, Quemchi, Dalcahue, Quinchao, Puqueld√≥n, Chonchi, Queil√©n, Quell√≥n, Chait√©n, Hualaihu√©, Futaleuf√∫ and Palena). The commune is represented in the Senate by Camilo Escalona Medina (PS) and Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).

The show was popular amongst younger viewers, prompting two annuals to be published in 1982 and 1983. The annuals featured comic strips based on popular characters Abbot had created in the various series of the show.

Kari Valtteri Tarkiainen (born 14 June 1938 in Helsinki) is a Finnish historian and archivist, who served as the national archivist of Finland 1996‚Äì2003. He is a grandson of the scholar Viljo Tarkiainen and his wife, writer Maria Jotuni. Tarkiainen has had a career in the world of archives both in Finland and Sweden. From 1971 he was employed in the Swedish National Archives in Stockholm. He finished his career as archivist in Helsinki as chief of the National Archives of Finland 1996‚Äì2003. Tarkiainen became a PhD in 1974 with a dissertation on the view of Russia in Sweden during the early great power era. He is a specialist in medieval history, and has formed the conception of the Finnish reformer Mikael Agricola. Amongst his most important works are a history of Finnish migration to Sweden, Finnarnas historia i Sverige 1-2 (1990‚Äì93), and Sveriges √ñsterland fr√•n forntiden till Gustav Vasa (2008), which concerns the central issues of Finland's history, with special focus on the relations between Finnish and Swedish language, economy, settlement, church organisation, administration, and cultural forms.

The title refers to the residue left behind when coal is carbonised at . It was invented by Thomas Parker in 1904. In 1936 the Smoke Abatement Society awarded its inventor a posthumous gold medal. Coalite is darker and more friable than high temperature coke. It is easier to ignite, burns with an attractive flame, and is lighter than coal, making it an ideal fuel for open domestic firegrates. Drawbacks are its tendencies to produce an excessive residual ash, to burn quickly and give off sulphurous fumes. Carbonisation process Coal delivered by rail, first from the nearby Bolsover colliery, and later from other sources, was heated in eight large air sealed ovens called \\"batteries\\". Volatile constituents were driven off and condensed into coal oil and a watery fraction called ammoniacal liquor. Coal gas was used to heat the ovens and also burned in the works boilers and furnaces. Any excess was flared off. The coal oil and liquor were piped over the road to the chemical works section where they were processed into various fractions and industrial chemicals. The residual Coalite solid fuel was cooled, then sorted into various grades based on size and stockpiled for distribution by road transport. The Coalite Company Two years after Parker died in 1915, the forerunner of the Coalite company was formed with the building of a production unit at Barugh near Barnsley. In the 20s, two more plants at Askern near Doncaster and at East Greenwich in London were opened, the latter being operated under license by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. In April 1937, the main manufacturing plant at Buttermilk Lane, Bolsover was opened by Prince George, Duke of Kent. At the time it was the largest one of its type in the world. In 1939, another works was opened at Wern Tarw in South Wales. In the 1950s older plants were closed and production was concentrated at the expanded Bolsover and Askern plants. Plants were also opened later in Rossington, near Doncaster, and at Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire. The coal oil and liquor from all these plants was processed at the central refinery at the Bolsover plant. The ovens continued producing Coalite until the Bolsover works closed down in 2004. By 1939, the company was producing a low octane petrol called \\"Coalene\\" as well as diesel and other fuel oils. It continued to do so through the Second World War and into the early 1960s. It supplied fuel to the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy during the war, reputedly keeping 12 squadrons flying and two battleships sailing. In 1948, the company changed its name to the Coalite Chemical Company to reflect the diversified nature of the business. In 1952 the registered Head office address was moved from London to Bolsover. In 1956, after the introduction of the Clean Air Act 1956 Coalite was licensed as an \\"authorised fuel\\". Demand increased and the company expanded accordingly. The group consisted of several companies in the 1950‚Äì1960s, with Francis L. Waring, F.Inst.F., as managing director of this group of companies: * Coalite and Chemical Products Limited, (the holding company) * Doncaster Coalite Limited, * The Derbyshire Coalite Co.Ltd, (ran the solid fuel production at Bolsover) * The British Diesel Oil & Petrol Co. (ran the refinery at Bolsover) * The South Wales Coalite Co. Ltd. * London Coalite Ltd. In 1978, the company merged with the Charringtons Coke distribution company and with this they acquired the Falkland Islands Company. From 1984 to 1989 Eric Varley, the ex-Labour cabinet minister was company chairman. In 1986, the group acquired Hargreaves Fuel distribution services. This marked the zenith of the company's fortunes. The group was now at its most diverse and widespread, owning subsidiaries that were totally unrelated to its core business. These included sheep farming, Dormobile camper vans, Builders merchants, Pyrometer Instrument manufacturers, vehicle sales and many others as well as industrial land across the country. From 1987 to 1991, the company sponsored Chesterfield F.C. In 1989, the company was taken over by Anglo United, From 1990 to 1992, the company sponsored world class snooker tournaments In 1997, Falkland Islands Holdings subsidiary was floated off and became an independent company again. The solid fuel side of the business began to shrink in the 1980s. There was falling demand for the product as cheaper natural gas gradually took over the domestic heating market. The Askern works closed in 1986 and Grimethorpe in 1994. After 1982, there were several waves of redundancies. As well as the reduced demand for solid fuel the slow demise of the company was accelerated after the Anglo takeover. During the 1990s, there were financial difficulties because the relatively small Anglo United had borrowed heavily from HSBC to buy the much larger Coalite group and had intended to service this debt by asset stripping Coalite's many subsidiaries, selling them off whilst retaining the core business of solid fuel production. The sell-off did not realise as much cash as was required and even a raid on the company pension fund did little to reduce the debt. Weighed down by this debt and with little money for investment the company declined as it faced outside competition in a downturned agrochemical market. It was making losses of ¬£2 million per annum in the late 90s. At the same time, it was embroiled in legal actions concerning land and river pollution and the resulting adverse publicity affected the sales of its products. In 2002, Anglo was bought by a consortium of local businessmen. Viable assets were covertly (but legally) moved into separate subsidiaries under the Anglo holding company. The remaining debts were left with the much diminished Coalite Chemicals Ltd which went into administration and then receivership, and finding no buyers, closed down finally in 2004, leaving a considerable number of redundant employees with much reduced pensions. Dioxin contamination The company gained attention as a manufacturer of the chemical, 245 trichlorophenol, a precursor of Agent Orange which was a defoliant used in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. An explosion in a pilot plant in 1968 had killed a chemist and spread dioxins over the debris. 79 employees contracted chloracne whilst cleaning up and even some of their families were affected by traces brought home on clothing. There was more controversy when the company appeared reluctant to reveal the location of sites where the contaminated plant debris was buried and when the case notes of an independent investigator were mysteriously stolen from her home. A specialised 245 unit was built soon after, with stringent controls and safety measures to prevent any future accidents but when the Seveso disaster in 1976 reawakened public concern over this issue, Ted Needham, the company chairman, deemed it expedient to close down this now uneconomical plant. The reluctance of his employees to work in it may also have influenced his decision. Problems continued with dioxin emission from the works incinerator which burned residues from the chlorination plant. This caused further public protest and instigated official investigations that culminated in prosecution and a fine of ¬£150,000 for contamination of the river Doe Lea and surrounding farmland in 1996. In 1994, the river gained the dubious distinction of being the most polluted in the world with regard to dioxins, 27 times higher than the second worst waterway, a Norwegian Fjord near a Magnesium processing plant. The pollution was believed to extend 13 miles downstream into the River Rother and the River Don, near Rotherham in South Yorkshire. Closure and redevelopment The site has been derelict since 2004. From 2005, the Bolsover works were gradually demolished. In November 2016, decontamination of the area began and the Environment Agency was made aware of an increase in odours from the site after complaints from local residents.

Baima is passed on from parents to children in Baima villages. It is spoken within the home domain and is not used in any media of mass communication. In terms of geographical locations, Baima is spoken in: *Baima ÁôΩÈ©¨ Township, Pingwu County, Mianyang, Sichuan ÂõõÂ∑ù *Baimaguhe ÁôΩÈ©¨Ë∞∑Ê≤≥, Wen County ÊñáÂéø, Gansu ÁîòËÇÉ *Wujiao Áâ©ËßíÊùë, Jiuzhaigou County ‰πùÂØ®Ê≤üÂéø, Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan ÂõõÂ∑ù Baima uses subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb (SOV) word order, initial consonant word clusters and is tonal. It is unclassified within Sino- Tibetan; there are multiple layers of borrowings from Amdo, Khams, and Zhongu Tibetan, as well as lexical and grammatical connections with Qiangic languages. Basic vocabulary is about 85% Tibetic and 15% Qiangic, and the Tibetic words do not link to any established group of Tibetic languages. Chirkova (2008) suggests that the Qiangic vocabulary \\"might be a retention from the language originally spoken by the B√°im«é before their shift to a form of Tibetic in the 7th century.\\" She accepts Baima as Tibetan, but as an isolate within the Tibetic languages.Katia Chirkova, 2008, \\"On the position of B√°im«é within Tibetan\\", in Lubotsky et al (eds), Evidence and Counter-Evidence, vol. 2.  History  Baima speakers number around 10,000 and have lived for generations in the mountainous region spanning the borders of Sichuan and Gansu Provinces. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Baima speakers have requested to grant them recognition as an independent ethnic group on many occasions. Historians believe that the Baima are decedents of the ancient Di people in China. Chinese records from 551 AD mention that The Di are also called Baima. One historian states, \\"The Baima tribe was the largest tribe of the Di nationality, which lived in Gansu, Sichuan and Shaanxi during the Three Kingdoms Period (220‚Äì265 AD).\\" Tibetans invaded the Di territory in the 7th century and assimilated the local population, which probably subsequently shifted into a form of Tibetan spoken by the invaders. Linguists consider Baima to be an independent language of the Tibetan branch but the language itself has been greatly influenced by Tibetan. In addition, DNA specialists have discovered that the Baima are genetically closer to the Qiang people than to the Tibetans.  Dialects  There are distinctions within the Baima language itself. Baima is mainly divided into three dialect groups: Southern Baima (Pingwu Baima), Northern Baima (Wenxian Baima), Western Baima (Jiuzhaigou Baima, Songpan Baima). The Baima spoken in Jiuzhaigou and surrounding areas differs from that spoken in Songpan County in the Aba Tibetan-Qiang Autonomous Prefecture and Wenxian County in Gansu Province. Sun Hongkai, et al. (2007)Sun Hongkai, et al. (2007). Baimayu yanjiu ÁôΩÈ©¨ËØ≠Á†îÁ©∂. Beijing: Ethnic Publishing House Ê∞ëÊóèÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ. document the following three dialects of Baima. *Pingwu County, Sichuan *Tielou (ÈìÅÊ•ºËóèÊóè‰π°), Wen County, Gansu *Wujiao (ÂãøËßí‰π°), Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan  Classification  The classification of Baima has caused controversy among linguists. Baima is provisionally classified with the Khams group, although it also has a number of Amdo characteristics. Reasons for this are presumably the drastic simplification of the syllable structure, the elimination of ancient Tibetan syllables codas and the presence of tones. While many scholars believe that Baima is a separate Tibeto-Burma subgroup in its own right, others believe that it should be identified as a Tibetan dialect. While Baima and Tibetan share many basic similarities, they are essentially different. In fact, the differences between Baima and Tibetan far exceeded those existing between the three main Tibetan dialects spoken within Chinese territory. Therefore, Baima scholar, Sun Hognkai, argued that \\"Baima should be considered an independent language which is different from Tibetan but which belongs to the Tibetan branch.\\"  Vocabulary  Overall, Baima vocabulary is highly heterogeneous. It consists predominantly of transparent Tibetan provenance and appears to combine features of Khams and Amdo.Ekaterina Chirkova. On the Position of Baima within Tibetan: A Look from Basic Vocabulary. Alexander Lubotsky, Jos Schaeken and Jeroen Wiedenhof. Rodopi, pp.23, 2008, Evidence and counter- evidence: Festschrift F. Kortlandt. However, sound correspondences between sound system of ancient Tibetan, as reflected in standard Written Tibetan orthography and Baima are less regular than those between Written Tibetan orthography and established groups of Modern Tibetan dialects. Baima vocabulary also exhibits two features which are not present in all other dialects: first, voicing of voiceless aspirated stops and affricates after nasal prefixes; second, the treatment of written Tibetan orthography. Further more, Baima has some words that are of unclear etymology, even in its basic vocabulary. The proportion of these words has never been estimated, nor has basic vocabulary ever been the topic of detailed investigation. In Ekaterina Chirkova's article, \\"On the Position of Baima within Tibetan: A Look from Basic Vocabulary\\", she examined the 100-word Swadesh list for Baima, as the layer of lexicon which is arguably least resistible to change and which therefore can shed light on the genetic affiliation of this language. She then discovered that the 100-word Swadesh list for B√°im«é contains 84 words of Tibetan origin, 15 words of unclear origin and another 7 words with partial cognation, in which one element is of unidentified origin. 4 words are doublets, most of which combine one word of unclear origin with a word of Tibetan origin. According to her analysis, Baima has a simple syllable structure. All Baima syllables are open an have the (n)(C)V makeup, where \\"n\\" stands for prenasalization and is homorganic with the following consonant. Most Baima verbs have two stems, the imperfective, marked by prenasalization and mostly the high falling tone, and the perfective/imperative, marked by the high rising tone. Baima verbs have directional aspect, with different prefixes combining with verbs to represent progression of an action in a specific direction. Using prefixes to show directional aspect is an important and unique feature in Baima language. In sum, Chirkova concluded that Baima diverge significantly in lexicon and phonology from the established groups of Tibetan dialects.  Grammar  Transcriptions of different words from Baima, Kham, and Amdo in Tibetan and Chinese Documents by Song Hongkai * Baima dual and plural pronouns for the first person have inclusive an exclusive forms. Baima singular personal pronouns have nominative accusative forms, which are expressed by inflectional changes in the vowels. The forms of Baima pronouns for the third person, whether singular, dual, or plural, are very different from those in the Tibetan dialects. * In comparison to Tibetan, Baima has many more classifiers. Among the over 3,000 common lexical items included in A Study of the Baima lexicon transcribed in Tibetan and Chinese, there were over 110 specific or loan classifiers. For instance, in Baima, there are many different words for the numeral \\"one\\" which can combine with classifiers and the reason for it is unclear. An increasing number of classifiers also led to an increase in their function in Baima grammar, while the ways in which they are used are also changing. * Directionality is an important grammatical feature in Baima. * Baima has a large number of case-marking articles, which perform very important syntactic functions.  Phonology  The phonology of Baima is very similar to that of the Kham Tibetan dialect. They have both retained a voiced‚Äìvoiceless contrast and have 4‚Äì5 contrastive tones as opposed to Amdo dialect. Affricates: four sets of affricates exist in the Baima language. They are apical, retroflex, laminal and pre-laminal. Rhymes: Baima rhymes are very similar to the Kham Tibetan dialect but its vowel system is much more complex. Codas have essentially been lost and vowels show considerable differentiation, with the appearance of many back diphthongs. In general, the number of tones in Baima is also similar to Kham Tibetan. But the correspondences between Baima tones, onsets, and rhymes with written Tibetan are not as clear as those between Khan Tibetan and written Tibetan.  Controversy  The status of the Baima language has caused major controversy among scholars and the people within the region. As a native language spoken by the natives in the Tibetan region, Baima certainly shared similarities with Tibetan dialects. Although the Baima people have sought after their claims as an independent ethnic group since the 1960s, the Baima language remained classified as a Tibetan dialect. According to linguistic research conducted by Baima scholars such as Song Hongkai, Nishida Tatsuo, and Katia Chirkova, who extensively analyzed the grammatical, lexical, and phonological differences between Baima and Tibetan, Baima should not be regarded as a Tibetan dialect, but instead, an independent language within the Tibetan branch. Because of its status as a minority language, the use of Baima is limited to religious ceremonies and intercommunication between Baima villages, which significantly furthered the endangerment of Baima language. Additionally, the language of communication with neighboring communities throughout all Baima-inhabited areas is Mandarin Chinese. As for the Baima people themselves, they were never officially reclassified as an individual ethnic group rather than a branch of Tibetans, as \\"reclassification of ethnic groups listed as Tibetans remains a sensitive issue in the PRC, and is considered by many Tibetans as an attack on Tibetan identity by the Chinese government.\\" As a result, the Baima language remains poorly documented till this day and continues to raise the question of language in the role of cultural survival.

Furthermore, on 25 May, the European Investment Fund was established by the EIB and the European Police Office was created on 26 July 1995 with the signing of the Europol convention. President Santer Due to concerns over the proposal of Jean-Luc Dehaene as President of the European Commission, with the United Kingdom not wishing another Jacques Delors, Jacques Santer (then-Prime Minister of Luxembourg) was proposed as a less federalist option. However, due to this. he was seen as being the \\"second choice\\" which weakened his position, with the European Parliament approving him only by a narrow majority. He did however flex his powers over the nominations for the other Commissioners. The President gained this power under the Maastricht Treaty that came into force the previous year. On 18 January 1995 he managed to get his Commission approved by Parliament by 416 votes to 103 (a larger majority than expected), and they were appointed by the Council on 23 January. 1994 elections On 9 to 12 June 1994, the fourth European elections were held resulting in a Socialist victory. During its first session, 19 to 26 July, Parliament elected Klaus H√§nsch as its president and approved Jacques Santer as Commission President. His Commissioners were approved on 18 January 1995 and took office on the 23rd. On 19 July 1997, Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil Robles was elected President of the Parliament. Free movement On 1 January 1994 the European Economic Area (EEA) entered into force, allowing European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members Norway and Iceland to enter the Single European Market (created the previous year) without joining the Union, in exchange for financial contributions and taking on of relevant EU law. Switzerland had rejected membership and Liechtenstein joined the following year on 1 May.European Economic Area CVCE.eu On 23 February 1995 the ECJ gave the \\"Bordessa ruling\\": citizens may export banknotes without prior authorisation (free movement of capital). Later that year on 15 December, it gave the Bosman ruling, ruling that restriction on number of (EU) foreign players in football teams is illegal (free movement of people). The Schengen Agreement (signed in 1985) came into effect on 26 March 1995 between Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Austria signed up on 28 April followed by Denmark, Finland and Sweden, alongside non-EU members Norway and Iceland, on 19 December 1996. The EU-Turkey customs union entered into force on 1 January 1996. Amsterdam Treaty The intergovernmental conference leading to the Treaty of Amsterdam opened on 29 March 1996 in Turin. On 22 July 1997, leaders of the Western European Union met and adopted a declaration, to be added to the treaty, defining its role with the EU and NATO. The Treaty was signed by foreign ministers on 2 October. The treaty entered into force on 1 May 1999. The treaty sought to create an \\"area of freedom, justice and security\\" as well as strengthen the CFSP. There would also be institutional reforms to make the Union more democratic and adjust it to enlargement.The Treaty of Amsterdam CVCE.eu Amsterdam also incorporated the conclusions of the 1992 Edinburgh European Council which set out the current arrangements in regards to the seat of the institutions; the Parliament would thus be based in Strasbourg, where it must hold \\"twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions, including the budget session\\". However additional sessions may be held in Brussels, which is where committees must also meet while the secretariat must remain in Luxembourg. The Commission and Council would be based in Brussels however some Council meetings and some departments of the Commission would be in Luxembourg which would also host the judicial and financial bodies of the EU. However the Central Bank would be in Frankfurt and Europol in The Hague. Foreign policy During the 90s, the development EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was given a strong impetus by the conflicts in the Balkans. The EU failed to react during the beginning of the conflict, and UN peacekeepers from the Netherlands failed to prevent the Srebrenica massacre (July 1995) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the largest mass murder in Europe since the second world war. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finally had to intervene in the war, forcing the combatants to the negotiation table. On 14 December 1995, the Dayton Agreement was signed in Paris, ending the conflict in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 24 March 1999, the situation on Kosovo led to an EU CFSP declaration on Kosovo and prompted a NATO intervention in Kosovo and Serbia. While there was greater EU involvement in the Kosovo conflict than in the Bosnian conflict, the failure of the EU to prevent the conflicts in former Yugoslavia, or to bring them to a quick close, heightened the desire for greater EU effectiveness in foreign affairs.Chris Patten: Towards a Common Foreign Policy ec.europa.eu The early foreign policy experience of the EU led to it being emphasised in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force on 1 May 1999. The treaty created the High Representative with Javier Solana being appointed to fill the post who was also seen by some as Europe's first Foreign Minister. It also led to the 1997 declaration by Western European Union leaders on that organisation's role with the EU and NATO.Javier Solana/Spain: Europe's First Foreign Minister? businessweek.com In response, the Nice Treaty strengthened the High Representative and foreign policy cooperation. Budget crisis Towards the end of 1998 a crisis developed around the community's budget for 1996. There had been allegations of financial mismanagement in the Commission. The Parliament decided to refuse to give its approval to the budget, throwing the Commission into crisis. The People's Party attempted to force the resignation of the Commissioners √âdith Cresson and Manuel Mar√≠n (both members of the Socialists) while the Socialist group still supported the Commission though and attempted a vote of confidence. Eventually a PES proposal based on collective responsibility (not singling out the two socialist Commissioners) was approved and a committee of independent experts was established to investigate. The committee produced its report on 15 March 1999 and was presented to the Commission and Parliament. It largely cleared most members, aside from Cresson, but concluded that there was growing reluctance of the Commissioners to acknowledge responsibility and that \\"It was becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone who had the slightest sense of responsibility.\\" In response to the report, PES withdrew their support from the Commission leading to a collapse of support for the Commission. Santer announced on evening of the reports publication that the entire Commission had resigned. √âdith Cresson went before the European Court of Justice and, in July 2006, was found guilty but was not stripped of her pension. Cresson today is largely held accountable for the fall of Santer, who went on to serve time as an MEP and never fully recovered, and the rest of his Commission. The immediate effect on the Commission was that it became politically weakened and unable to react to the beginning of the Kosovo War and the close of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was the most profound, the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power. Due to the crisis, the following Commission rapidly established the anti-fraud watchdog OLAF. and seen as having failed in its duty. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit. Meanwhile, Parliament gained the publicity it sought and by exercising its power the Council was forced to take increased heed of its views in the appointment of the next Commission. It also showed a Parliament operating with a greater government-opposition dynamic of the two main parties than before. In the following 1999 parliamentary elections turnout did not increase as hoped, but the People's Party did defeat the Socialists, for the first time since elections began, becoming the largest party in Parliament. President Prodi On 1 May 1999, Amsterdam Treaty entered into force and on 5 May Parliament approved Romano Prodi as Commission President. Under the new powers of the Amsterdam Treaty, Prodi was described by some as the 'First Prime Minister of Europe'.Prodi to Have Wide, New Powers as Head of the European Commission iht.com 16 April 1999 On 4 June, Javier Solana was appointed Secretary General of the Council and the new post of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. On 10‚Äì13 June 1999 the Fifth European elections were held in all 15 members. On 20 July it elected Nicole Fontaine as its president and it approved the Prodi Commission on 15 September and it subsequently took office. In response to the recent scandal around the Santer Commission, OLAF was set up on 18 June 1999 to fight fraud in the Union's institutions. The Parliament later elected its new president, Pat Cox, on 16 January 2002. As well as the enlargement and Amsterdam Treaty, the Prodi Commission also saw the signing and enforcement of the Nice Treaty as well as the conclusion and signing of the European Constitution: in which he introduced the \\"Convention method\\" of negotiation.Discover the former Presidents: The Prodi Commission, Europa (web portal), Accessed 23 August 2007 The body was however criticised for being lacklustre, with poor communication and failing to make an impact despite major events such as enlargement and the euro.BM: The new Commission ‚Äì some initial thoughts bmbrussels.be 2004 The commission was due to leave office on 31 October 2004, but due to opposition from the European Parliament to the proposed Barroso Commission which would succeed it, it was extended and finally left office on 21 November 2004. Nice Treaty To deal with the impending enlargement in 2004 leaders met in Nice on 7 December 2000 to create a new treaty that would ensure the functioning of the Union with the extra members. The Nice Treaty was signed two months later on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003. The Commission and the European Parliament were disappointed that the Nice Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) did not adopt many of their proposals for reform of the institutional structure or introduction of new Community powers, such as the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor. The European Parliament threatened to pass a resolution against the Treaty; although it had no formal power of veto, the Italian Parliament threatened that it would not ratify without the European Parliament's support. However, in the end this did not happen and the European Parliament approved the Treaty. During the ratification period of the Nice Treaty, the European Convention began work on the European Constitution, starting work on 28 February 2002, shortly after the Paris Treaty establishing the ECSC expired on 23 July. On the basis of the work of the European Convention, an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) was held in Rome on 4 October 2003 to make changes the proposed text. It was signed in Rome on 28 October 2004 by all leaders of the new and old members, but was not ratified. (see also: Lisbon Treaty) Economic and Monetary Union On 1 January 1994, the second stage of the EMU began under the Maastricht Treaty with the establishment of the European Monetary Institute. On 16 December 1995, the date for the introduction of the euro was set as 1 January 1999. On 14 October 1996 the Finnish mark entered the ERM and the Italian lira re-entered the ERM on 25 November. The Greek drachma entered the ERM on 16 January 1998, too late for the 3 May 1998 Council meeting where 11 members (the 15, minus Sweden, Denmark, Greece and the United Kingdom) would adopt the euro in 1999. On 1 June the European Central Bank was established. Final meetings are held in December with irrevocable conversion rates being set on 31 December, becoming a live currency as planned the following day. 2000 saw the Commission recommending Greece joining the eurozone, which it did at the start of 2001. However, both Denmark and Sweden rejected the currency in referendums held on 28 September 2000 and 14 September 2003, respectively. On 1 January 2002, the physical euro currency came into circulation in the 12 eurozone states, and became the sole legal currency of 12 eurozone states (Greece included) on 28 February. Enlargement On 30 March 1994, accession negotiations concluded with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Sweden and Finland had applied since the fall of the Iron Curtain; allowing them, as Cold War-neutral countries, to now align themselves with the Union. Their accession treaties were signed on 25 June of that month. Each country held referendums on entry resulting on entry for all except Norway (its second failed referendum); * Austria ‚Äì 66.6% in favour (12 June); application submitted in July 1989 * Finland ‚Äì 56.9% in favour (16 October); application submitted in March 1992 (separate referendum held in √Öland) * Sweden ‚Äì 52.8% in favour (13 November); application submitted in July 1991 * Norway ‚Äì 47.8% in favour (28 November); application submitted in December 1992 Austria, Finland and Sweden became EU members on 1 January 1995. Sweden held their elections to the parliament later that year on 17 September. The following year, Austria held its elections on 13 October and Finland on 20 October. Since the 1990s, numerous states were moving towards membership. Following on from 1995, and aside from the aspirations of Turkey, there were 12 countries advanced on the path to membership. These were: the two Mediterranean countries of Malta and Cyprus; the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia; and 9 former eastern bloc countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. It was hoped that Cyprus would join as a unified island. However, northern Cyprus has remained outside the control of the internationally recognised government of the Republic of Cyprus since the Turkish invasion of 1974. The Annan Plan for the resolution of the Cyprus dispute was rejected by Greek Cypriots in a 2004 referendum. The accession treaties were signed on 16 April 2003 in Athens, admitting Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. Romania and Bulgaria were not among the 10 chosen to accede in 2004. Finally, on 1 May 2004, the Union expanded from 15 to 25 members, the largest single expansion in its history. Its population jumped from 381 million to 456 million and its size grew from 3367 to 4104 thousand km¬≤ (See Enlargement Statistics). The 10 countries also brought with them 162 MEPs and 10 Commissioners, who joined the Prodi Commission on 1 May.Europa, History of EU 2000‚ÄìPresent europa.eu References 1993 ","title":"History of the European Union (1993‚Äì2004)"},{"id":"17751400","text":"Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Harry Claude Moorhouse, (30 January 1872 ‚Äì 16 December 1934) was an officer in the British Army who saw action in West Africa.

The song was initially released in August 1969 on the Easy Rider soundtrack album as a Roger McGuinn solo performance. It was later issued in an alternate version as a single by McGuinn's band the Byrds on October 1, 1969. The Byrds' single reached number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was issued in most international territories, although it was not released in the United Kingdom. Senior editor for Rolling Stone magazine, David Fricke, has described the song as perfectly capturing the social mood of late 1969 and highlighting \\"the weary blues and dashed expectations of a decade's worth of social insurrection.\\" Roger McGuinn's version The star and script writer of Easy Rider, Peter Fonda, had initially intended to use Bob Dylan's song \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" in the film, but after failing to license the track, Fonda asked Roger McGuinn of the Byrds to record a cover version of the song instead. Fonda also wanted Dylan to write the film's theme song, but Dylan declined, quickly scribbling the lines - \\"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\\" - on to a napkin, before telling Fonda to \\"give this to McGuinn. He'll know what to do with it.\\" The lyric fragment was dutifully passed on to McGuinn, who took the lines and expanded upon them with his own lyrical and musical contributions to produce the finished song. When Dylan saw a private screening of Easy Rider and realised that he had been credited as co-writer of the film's theme song, he telephoned McGuinn and demanded that his name be removed from both the film's closing credits and all subsequent releases of the song. McGuinn has theorised in interviews that Dylan disowned the song because \\"he didn't like the movie that much. He didn't like the ending. He wanted to see the truck blow up in order to get poetic justice. He didn't seem to understand Peter Fonda's anti-hero concept.\\" Other critics have speculated that Dylan's reason for insisting his co-writing credit be removed was the belief that his name was being exploited to boost the film's street credibility. The version of \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\" used in the film and included on the Easy Rider soundtrack album is listed as a solo performance by McGuinn and features the singer accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, with fellow Byrd Gene Parsons playing harmonica. This McGuinn solo version is a completely different take from the version that McGuinn's band the Byrds would later release as a single and include on their Ballad of Easy Rider album. In the 21st century, McGuinn continues to perform the song during his solo concerts and consequently a recording of it appears on his 2007 live album, Live from Spain. The Byrds' version The Byrds' version of the song was recorded on June 18, 1969, and is performed at a quicker tempo than the soundtrack version. The song was also lengthened by producer Terry Melcher by editing a copy of the first verse onto the end of the second, effectively creating a third verse. In addition, Melcher added an orchestral overdub to the track in an attempt to emulate recent hit singles like Glen Campbell's \\"Gentle on My Mind\\" and Harry Nilsson's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\". As recording sessions for the Byrds' eighth studio album continued, interest in the band mounted as a result of their involvement with the Easy Rider film, leading McGuinn to announce in interviews that the band's next album would be titled Captain America, in honor of Peter Fonda's character in the film. However, this idea was discarded and ultimately the song \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\" gave the new Byrds' album its title. The B-side of the Byrds' single was the traditional song \\"Oil in My Lamp\\", although there are copies of the single known to exist with the Goffin-King song \\"Wasn't Born to Follow\\" on the B-side instead. The Byrds' recording of \\"Wasn't Born to Follow\\" first appeared on their 1968 album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, but since it had been featured prominently in Easy Rider, Columbia Records saw fit to include the song on some copies of \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\". CBS Records in the United Kingdom went a step further by reissuing \\"Wasn't Born to Follow\\" as the A-side of a single in September 1969, in the hopes that it might provide the Byrds with a fluke hit (although it failed to chart). \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\" was first introduced into the Byrds' live concert repertoire during February 1969 and would go on to be performed relatively frequently throughout the rest of the year and into 1970. However, the song was played only rarely between 1971 and the band's break-up in 1973. In addition to its appearance on the Ballad of Easy Rider album, the song can also be found on several Byrds' compilations, including The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II, History of The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, and The Essential Byrds. An extended, alternate mix of the song, featuring more prominent percussion and Clarence White's lead guitar solo (which had been edited out of the version found on the album), was included as a bonus track on the 1997 Columbia/Legacy reissue of Ballad of Easy Rider. In addition, a live performance of the song, recorded at the Felt Forum in New York City on March 1, 1970, was included as a bonus track on the remastered (Untitled) album in 2000. Cover versions \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\" has been covered by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their version of the song was included as a bonus track on the 2003 re-release of the band's 1969 album, Unhalfbricking. Folk and blues singer Odetta also recorded a version of \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\" for the 1969 various artists compilation, The Original Hits Of Right Now Plus Some Heavies From The Motion Picture \\"Easy Rider\\". Additionally, the arranger and composer Percy Faith released a recording of the song on his 1970 album, Held Over! Today's Great Movie Themes. Bruce Springsteen covered the song during his August 20, 1981, performance at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, a concert that was entitled A Night for the Vietnam Veteran. A live cover by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from 1987 was featured on the deluxe edition of their career- spanning set, The Live Anthology. Grant McLennan included a recording of the song on his 1994 album Horsebreaker Star and British singer-songwriter Kathryn Williams covered \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\" on her 2004 album, Relations.

Its conception of Freemasonry is spiritual, traditional and initiatory. Its ritual is centred on the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. It sees itself as occupying a unique position in the landscape of French Freemasonry but however maintains certain levels of relationships with other continental obediences. It is an independent and sovereign Masonic Power, and shares its motto Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√© with France. The Duke of Wharton, Grand Master of Freemasons in France in 1728 1771 portrait painting of Louis, Count of Clermont, Grand Master of the Grande Loge de France from 1743 to 1771, by Fran√ßois Hubert Drouais History Origins of the name and Foundation The name Grande Loge de France was used by the first French Masonic grand body of which the oldest records are dated 14 May 1737. However, it dates back to 1728 when French Masons had decided to recognize Philip, Duke of Wharton (1698-1731) - who lived in Paris and Lyon in 1728 and 1729 and who had been Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster in 1723 - as Grand Master of all Masons in France. Two other jacobite Grand Masters succeeded him: James Hector MacLean (1703-1750) and Charles Radclyffe, Count of Derwentwater (1693-1746), elected Grand Master of the Order of Free Masons in the Kingdom of France on 27 December 1746. In the 1738 version, the Constitutions of Anderson mention the existence of a Grand Master and Lodges in France and defined them to be equal to the Lodges of York, Ireland, Scotland and Italy. In December 1736, Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay (1686-1743) delivered a reception Discourse elaborating on what could be a connection between Freemasonry and the Crusader knights. This discourse had a great influence on the development of several side Degrees over the period 1740-1770 in France. Following the death of the Grand Master of all Regular Lodges in France Louis de Pardaillan de Gondrin, Duc d'Antin, his successor Louis, Count of Clermont (1709-1771), blood Prince Bourbon-Cond√© and future member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise was elected on 11 December 1743. In the following years, many additional \\"Scottish\\" High Degrees are redacted in France. They were put in practise in Bordeaux, Lyon and Marseille. The Grande Loge de France did not take part in their development but recognized them as of 4 July 1755 in its General Bylaws, thus acknowledging different privileges to Scottish Masters. In 1773, a large number of Grande Loge de France Lodges gave themselves a new set of Statutes which lead to the creation the Grand Orient de France. Nevertheless, several Parisian Masters and several provincial Lodges objected to these new Statutes, and more particularly to the article which stipulated that Masters must be elected by the free-choice of their Lodge. As a result, they decided to pursue working under the name Grande Loge de Clermont, named after the Grand Master who had died in 1771. The French Revolution forced the Grande Loge de Clermont to suspend its activities in November 1792. After the Terror, they will resume on 17 October 1796, with only 10 Lodges in Paris and 8 in the provinces. The Grand Orient de France had its number of Lodges also drastically reduced over that period. It was able to resume its activities a bit later, on 24 February 1797. Alexandre Ro√´ttiers de Montaleau was appointed Great Worshipful Master to operate the merger between the Grande Loge de Clermont and the Grand Orient de France on 10 June 1799. Pursuing its path for reformation, the Grand Orient de France then reorganized its system of High Degrees of the French Rite, defined in seven degrees. In its general circular dated 12 November 1802, the Grand Orient de France prohibited the practice of any other system of High Degrees to all its member Lodges. Jean-Jacques R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in France from 1806 to 1821 The Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Conseil de France from 1838 to 1860: √âlie, Duc Decazes, here in 1859 Gustave Mesureur, thrice Grand Master of the Grande Loge de France The Scottish Rite in France between 1804 and 1894 In 1804, Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, Count de Grasse-Tilly recently arrived in Paris brought news of the birth of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in the United States in 1801, the Rite being based on the Scottish Degrees originating from French Antilles. He received a warm welcome from brethren and founded on 22 September 1804 the first continental Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The same enhanced the transformation of Lodges recently aggregated around ¬´ Saint-Alexandre d‚Äô√âcosse ¬ª into a new symbolic Obedience in charge of the first three symbolic Degrees: the Grande Loge G√©n√©rale Ecossaise. The ¬´ Grande Loge G√©n√©rale Ecossaise ¬ª elected Prince Louis Bonaparte as its first Grand Master. However, Napol√©on I, Emperor of the French imposed its merger with the Grand Orient de France on 5 December 1804 under the authority of Jean-Jacques-R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s. The vocabulary applicable to Freemasonry in France evolved at that time: Scottish Lodge which characterised High Degrees became of use to define all Lodges not pertaining to the French Rite. Elements from the Grande Loge des Anciens founded in England in 1751 rooted the first Three Degrees of the Rite in 1804. Its completion was reached in 1821 with the publishing of the Guide des Macons Ecossais. It was enacted by the who then administered the 33 Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. In 1838, the √âlie, duc Decazes is appointed Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Conseil de France: he will occupy the charge until 1860. In 1862, Napol√©on III personally appointed Bernard Pierre Magnan Marshall of France to be the successor of Prince Lucien Murat as Grand Master of the Grand Orient de France. Bernard Pierre Magnan intended to impose the reunification of all Rites then practised in France within the Grand Orient de France. He failed to do so due to the valiant opposition of Jean-Pons-Guillaume Viennet, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supr√™me Conseil de France from 1860 to 1868. Recent history The current Grande Loge de France (G‚à¥L‚à¥D‚à¥F‚à¥) was revived in 1894 when the Scottish Rite masonic streams were unified. In 1904, privileges to fully administrate the first Three Degrees of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite were delegated by the Supr√™me Conseil de France. The first Constitution of the revived Grande Loge de France - based on the Declaration of Principles from the Convent of Lausanne of 1875 - defined Freemasonry as a \\"universal alliance based on solidarity\\" aiming at the promotion of emancipatory evolution of Humanity. In the early 20th century, the Grande Loge de France grew from 3,000 members in 1894 to 8,400 in 1912. In 1914, it accounted with 149 Lodges. Some of these Lodges were specifically centered on the study of symbolism: the Anglo-Saxon Lodge as well Thebah, Lodge of which Ren√© Gu√©non was a member. In 1911, Grande Loge de France purchased a former franciscan monastery at 8 rue Puteaux in Paris 17th district to establish its current Headquarters. During the First World War and even though activity was reduced, an International Conference was held in January 1917 between Obediences from France, Belgium, Italy and Serbia. The creation of the League of Nations was favourably voted on that occasion. An exceptional Convent was held on 30 and 31 January 1926 with the purpose of fighting fascism. In June 1940, the archives of Grande Loge de France were seized by the Gestapo and the german authorities occupied the building of 8 rue Puteaux. However, the Scottish Freemasonry tried to survive in the clandestinity imposed by wartimes, but and following the Principles that had been edicted by the Grand Master Dumesnil de Gramont at the end of 1940. At the time of the Lib√©ration and due to the deaths of many members in Deportation, the Grande Loge de France resumed its works with only 3,600 brethren. It focused on its works and the initiatory and symbolic dimensions of traditional Freemasonry. In December 1948, a major Temple of the Grande Loge de France Headquarters was named in honor of Brother Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was inaugurated by Eleanor Roosevelt in person. In the 1960s and 1970s its Grand Master, Doctor played a key role in the elaboration of the law on contraception presented to Parliament by Simone Veil in 1975. During the second half of the 20th century, Grande Loge de France has steadily grown from 438 Lodges and 17,500 members in 1989 to 640 Lodges and 25,000 members in 1998. As of 2020 it accounts with 930 Lodges and over 33,000 members. The Grande Loge de France works the first three Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite (A&ASR;). Principles and governance Principles of Freemasonry The Grande Loge de France imposes the strict observance of the fundamental following principles: * Invocation to the Great Architect of the Universe, * Presence in Lodge of the Three Great Lights: the Volume of the Sacred Law (Bible) opened and exposed with the Square and the Compass, * Exclusive sovereignty over the Symbolic Degrees * Total independance of any other structure including of High Degrees * Male-only attendance in all Ritual works * Exemption of any political or religious discussion in the Lodge * Progressive and Spiritual approach to the initiatory process As such, the Grande Loge de France operates in the respect of fundamental Principles of traditional Freemasonry and refers constantly to the motto Ordo Ab Chao of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Governance The Grande Loge de France is governed by a Federal Counsel of 33 members elected by the Representative of each of the 930 Lodges during the annual Convent (General Assembly). The duration of the charge is 3 years. The Federal Counsel is presided by the Grand Master also elected by the Convent for the same duration of mandate. Since June 2018, the Grand Master of Grande Loge de France is Pierre-Marie Adam. The Grande Loge de France is defined by its Constitution and General Bylaws which apply to all members of the Obedience. Grande Loge de France outside France The Grande Loge de France has 36 lodges in 17 countries outside France as a result of history (Lodges in former French colonies) or when no Amity between a foreign Grand Lodge and the Grande Loge de France yet existed in the country at the time of the foundation. *Belgium: Two lodges in Tournai and Baisieux *Canada: One lodge in Montreal *Cambodia: One lodge in Phnom Penh *Congo: Ten lodges in Brazzaville, Dolisie, Goma, Kimshasa and Pointe Noire *Costa Rica: One lodge in San Jose *Dominican Republic: One lodge in Saint Domingue *England: One lodge in LondonThe White Swan Lodge, No 1348 *Israel: One lodge in Jerusalem, one lodge in Tel Aviv *Lithuania: One lodge in Kaunas *Madagascar: One lodge in Antananarivo *Mauritius: Six lodges in Grand Baie, Pamplemousses, Port-Louis, Saint-Pierre and Vacoas. *Poland: One lodge in Warsaw *Russia: One lodge in Moscow *Senegal: Three lodges in Dakar and Saly Portudal *Spain: One lodge in Barcelona *Thailand: One lodge in Bangkok, one lodge in Phuket *Vietnam: One lodge in Ho-Chi Mihn International Confederation of United Grand Lodges of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite In 2000, together with other European Grand Lodges, the Traditional and Symbolic \\"Opera\\" Grand Lodge (G‚à¥L‚à¥T‚à¥S‚à¥O‚à¥) and the G‚à¥L‚à¥D‚à¥F‚à¥ formed the Confederation of the United Grand Lodges of Europe.

Life  Spoliansky was born into a Jewish, musical family in Bia≈Çystok, then part of the Belostok Oblast of the Russian Empire. His father was an opera singer and his sister would later become a pianist and his brother a cellist. After the birth of Mischa the family moved to Warsaw, and later Kalisz. After the early death of his mother, the family moved to Vienna. Spoliansky's early musical education in piano, violin and cello was continued in Dresden under Professor Mark Guensberg. At the age of ten Spoliansky made his public debut. Shortly thereafter, his father died and Spoliansky moved to K√∂nigsberg (Prussia) where he had relatives. In 1914 however as a result of the war he had to flee to Berlin, where his brother worked as a cellist. Spoliansky worked in a coffeehouse as a pianist in order to continue his musical education at the Stern'sches Konservatorium. Spoliansky's first compositions were played by the UFA-Filmtheaterorchester in Friedrichstra√üe. In addition he worked as a composer and pianist in a Russian √©migr√© cabaret. There Friedrich Hollaender and Werner Richard Heymann heard him and invited him to write and play for the literary cabaret \\"Schall und Rauch\\" in the basement of the Gro√üe Schauspielhaus, which Max Reinhardt had founded in 1919. Spoliansky set the texts of Kurt Tucholsky, Klabund, Joachim Ringelnatz, and accompanied stars such as Gussy Holl, Paul O'Montis, Rosa Valetti and Trude Hesterberg. In 1920 under the pseudonym \\"Arno Billing\\" he composed the melody for the first homosexual anthem called Das lila Lied, which he dedicated to Magnus Hirschfeld. It was published with other texts such as Sei meine Frau f√ºr vierundzwanzig Stunden. In 1922 he met the poet Marcellus Schiffer and the diseuse Margo Lion. He married the dancer Elsbeth (Eddy) Reinwald in the same year. In 1927 Spoliansky accompanied Richard Tauber in a recording of 12 songs from Schubert's \\"Winterreise\\", having recorded an album of 12 German folk- songs with the tenor in the previous year. In 1928 Marlene Dietrich performed in his Revue Es liegt in der Luft (text by Marcellus Schiffer). One year later she would be \\"discovered\\" in Spoliansky's \\"Zwei Krawatten\\" (text by Georg Kaiser) by Josef von Sternberg, who was searching for the leading actress for The Blue Angel. There followed in 1930 \\"Wie werde ich reich und gl√ºcklich?\\", in 1931 \\"Alles Schwindel\\", in 1932 \\"Rufen Sie Herrn Plim\\" and \\"Das Haus dazwischen\\", and in 1933 \\"100 Meter Gl√ºck\\". When Hitler came to power in 1933, Spoliansky, like all Jewish artists in Germany, was no longer allowed to work in the now \\"Aryan\\" entertainment business. He was forced to emigrate to London, where he began a second career as a film composer. He was taken under wing by the expatriate film community as well as British producers and directors, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who had made films in Berlin in what had been, until Hitler, the international centre for film production. His naturalization as a British national succeeded in large part thanks to Schlagers \\"Heute Nacht Oder Nie\\" from the film Das Lied einer Nacht (1932), which made Spoliansky world-renowned. In London, he was hired by Zoltan Korda to compose the music for Sanders of the River, which was being shot on location in Nigeria. This included songs that were meant to be \\"authentic\\" Nigerian music, performed by star Paul Robeson, and the local Nigerian cast members and extras‚Äîbut they were composed in London by Spoliansky. Many years later, Zoltan Korda was delighted to discover, in a remote river in the Congo, Spoliansky's theme song for the movie being sung by Congolese fishermen as they paddled their boats upriver. Spoliansky had never been to Africa, but his work was so authentic that it became, in a sense, genuinely authentic.Charmed Lives (1979) by Michael Korda, p. 209 Sanders of the River began a collaboration with the great Paul Robeson. Among his very best songs were the four that he wrote for Robeson featured in Sanders of the River in 1935 (The Canoe Song, Love Song, Congo Lullabye and The Killing Song) and King Solomon's Mines in 1937 (Ho, Ho and Climbing Up!). Another of his songs was performed by Elisabeth Welch in 1937 (Red Hot Annabelle). Hitchcock remembered Spoliansky and hired him to write the song \\"Love Is Lyrical (Whisper Sweet Little Nothing to Me)\\", performed by Marlene Dietrich in Hitchcock's film Stage Fright. In later years he composed scores for films such as Trouble in Store (1953), Saint Joan (1957), The Whole Truth (1958), North West Frontier (1959), The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965), The Best House in London (1969) and Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973), on which he clearly had a personal perspective. Ever since that time, works by Spoliansky have occasionally been produced in theatres, for example in the 2004/2005 season \\"Zwei Krawatten\\" in Dortmund, and \\"Rufen Sie Herrn Plim\\" in the St√§dtischen B√ºhnen M√ºnster (2002/2003) and later in a theater in Kassel. Spoliansky died in London.

Synopsis Jean Chabot and Ren√© Delfrosse plan to hide in the cellar and rob the till at the Liege nightclub, Gai-Moulin. After the nightclub closes for the night, they venture out of the cellar and stumble on the body of a Greek man. Frightened and in shock they run away from the nightclub. Jean, who has been taking money from the petty cash at the office where he works, needs to return the money before the books are closed and so Ren√© steals cash from the till at his uncle's chocolate shop. When they find that they are being followed, they decide to throw the money down the toilet but Jean is arrested before he can do that. He insists he is innocent but the stories of Ad√®le, a dancer at the Gai-Moulin, Victor, a waiter at the Gai-Moulin, and Gennaro, the proprietor all seem to point at the guilt of the two boys. However, some suspicion also centers on a Frenchman who arrived in Leige on the same train, was staying at the same hotel as the murdered man, and who was at the Gai-Moulin at the same time. Inspector Delvigne does not know what to think when Maigret makes a surprising appearance on the scene. Publication history La Danseuse du Gai-Moulin was first published by Fayard in November 1931. Simenon, known to be a fast writer, is said to have penned the entire book in 25 hours.Notice bibliographique The first English edition (published simultaneously in the UK and the United States) was published by George Routledge and Sons in 1940 in a two book volume entitled Maigret Abroad (along with A Crime in Holland) with the title At the Gai-Moulin.

The seven buildings of the district represent one of the oldest clusters of what were basically working-class or lower-class residences in North America, and are in a cross-section of pre-statehood architectural styles. It includes two of the oldest colonial-era buildings in the southwest, the San Miguel Mission church (1710), and the \\"Oldest House\\", built in 1620 and now a museum. The district was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968. and Description and history The Barrio de Analco is located on the south side of the Santa Fe River, across the river from the main downtown area that includes the Santa Fe Plaza and the Palace of the Governors. The district is anchored at the junction of Old Santa Fe Trail and East De Vargas Street, and extends a short way (partial blocks) to the south, east and west. The San Miguel Mission church, on a site occupied by a church since the 1610s, is at the southeast corner, and the 1620 \\"Oldest House\\", a two-story adobe construction, is at the northeast corner. South of the mission is the Lamy Building, also known as St. Michael's Dormitory, an 1878 school building that exemplifies the Territorial style that was common in the pre- statehood era. West of the main junction, separated from it by the Santa Fe Playhouse, are the Gregorio Crespin House and the Roque Tudesqui House, both built in the Spanish Pueblo style. The Crespin House was built in the mid-18th century; the construction date of the Tudesqui House is unknown, but probably 18th century. Separated from the rest of the district near the junction of East De Vargas and Paseo de Peralta are the Boyle House, also a mid-18th century Spanish Pueblo building, and the Bandelier House, an 1867 Territorial style house that is further notable as a home of archaeologist Adolph Bandelier. The name \\"Analco\\" comes from the Nahuatl language spoken by the Tlaxcalteca people who accompanied the Spanish. \\"A\\" = water + \\"nal\\" = next to + \\"co\\" place of = next to the water (in this case a stream, the Santa Fe River). The barrio was established not long after Santa Fe's founding in 1609-10, as a district for artists, laborers, and servants, while the area north of the river was occupied by the wealthy and powerful.

Early years Ilario and his brother Gualtiero (Walter) with their first wheeled vehicle.Bandini was born in Villa Rovere, today part of the administrative region of Forl√¨ in Romagna. After finishing elementary school, he apprenticed as a mechanic and turner in Forli. At the age of 25 he moved to Eritrea, then an Italian colony, where he operated a transport business between Dekemhare and Asmara. He returned to Italy in 1939 and, with his savings, opened a garage and car rental/limousine service in downtown Forl√¨. The first Bandini In the same year, Bandini started competing as a motorcycle racer, racing at Faenza, Lugo di Romagna, and Imola. In 1940, he took part in the Mille Miglia, driving a Fiat Balilla \\"Coppa d'oro\\". During World War II, faced with shortages of fuel for civilian use, Bandini adapted his automobile engines to operate with wood gas. In 1946, he reassembled a Fiat 1100 that he had cut apart and hidden to avoid its requisition by the German army. He modified the chassis and suspension while rebuilding the car. Fitted with an aluminum body, the work of Turin coachbuilder Rocco Motto, this car became the Bandini 1100, the first to carry the Bandini name. 1940s racing career in Italy In 1947, Bandini raced a Cisitalia D46 at the Asti circuit, and raced his 1100 Sport at the Predappio- Rocca delle Camminate race, coming second in his class. After constructing a second example, Bandini entered the 1949 Mille Miglia with his new 1100 siluro, featuring torpedo-like bodywork and cycle fenders (separate mudguards). The car still used the same Fiat engine, modified with a twin overhead camshaft cylinder head based on an Alfa Romeo design. With this car, Bandini entered events at Senigallia, Ferrara, Modena, Bari, and Pescara. His first victory was a class win in the Tour of Umbria (Giro dell'Umbria). At the start of the 1950s, Bandini became a dealer in Italy for Alfa Romeo and then for Lancia. Meanwhile, the first Bandini arrived in United States. Here, in the hands of drivers Dick Gent and Bob Said, the car gained early racing successes: its lightness and stability, using a patented elliptical-section steel tube space frame, were particularly appreciated. 1950s racing opportunities in the United States American importer Tony Pompeo thought this space frame chassis, already winning in 1100 and 1500 cc classes with Fiat and Siata engines, could be even more competitive in the 750 cc category, equipped with Crosley powerplants. With this in mind, Bandini made changes to the engine lubrication system, distributor, and valvetrain, also marginally increasing the stroke, enlarging the capacity from 721 cc to 747 cc. He designed space frames weighing only 18 kg (40 lb), to which he fitted bodies by Motto, whose designs were perfectly in harmony with the Bandini philosophy, incorporating practicality and compliance with regulations, without sacrificing elegance of form. So was born the Bandini 750 sport siluro. These cars, when their headlights were removed, qualified to race in the sports category: they could also be adapted to qualify for the racing category simply by removing their cycle fenders (separate mudguards). With exports increasing, Bandini earned respect and success in races outside Italy, also gaining coverage in the specialist press. Two Bandinis were shown at Chicago in 1952, with a 750 sports torpedo displayed at the 1953 New York Auto Show at Madison Square Garden. Despite his commitments, Bandini himself continued to race, competing at Chieti, Senigallia, and Bari, as well as piloting the 750 to it first victory, the Bologna-Raticosa Hillclimb, in 1952. Meanwhile, Chuck Hassan and Beau Clarke shared a 750 in 1953's 12 Hours of Sebring (the first World Sports Car Championship event), after coming in third in the Six Hours of Vero Beach, first at Sowega (Georgia), and (despite lost time due to a puncture) second at Bryanfan. The first series of DOHC engines. Engineering evolutions The cars were designed in the corner of a garage and built by his brother Aurelio with a small trusted team, but it was Bandini himself who personally oversaw every aspect, from design to assembly to testing, whether on the bench, on the street, or on the track. From 1953, the bodywork was produced in-house, Meanwhile, the Crosley-sourced engines underwent a radical transformation: a new gear-driven DOHC head was fitted and a single Weber carburetor replaced the Dell'Orto. Rods, pistons, crankshaft, and sump were all replaced: all that remained of the original Crosley engine was the aluminium block. 1950s racing in Italy In 1953, the Bandini was adapted for new Italian racing regulations, which required fenders (mudguards) to be integrated into the body shell. Entered in the Mille Miglia, the 750 proved the World Sportscar Championship result at Sebring had been no fluke, but failed to finish in Forl√¨. Nevertheless, it was consistently placed in the top three at Salerno, Ascoli Piceno, Teramo, Macerata, Senigallia, Montenero Circuit, and the Consuma (Bologna) hillclimb, which concluded a successful fourth year in the Italian 750 cc championship. 750 sport torpedo. At the Mille Miglia, Massimo Bondi driving a Bandini 750 finished an excellent ninth in his class, out of a field of 69 entrants. A further 13 entries by other driver teams would be undertaken by 1957 (including Zanini-Vitali, Tinazzo- Sintoni, Fouls-Pacitti, Camisotti-Sintoni and Garavini). Notably, in 1955, two years before the final 'true' Mille Miglia, the Bandini 750 shared by Rusconi and Sintoni had to retire after a refuelling fire at Florence, but not before having reached Rome in just 7 hours 35 minutes 30 seconds, which was more than an hour quicker than two years earlier. Ilario Bandini in his 1100 with Cantelli at the start of the 1949 Mille Miglia. In 1954, production of the two seat sport torpedo continued alongside the new single seater Formula 3 car, for which an impressive at 9,000 rpm was claimed. A lowered centre of gravity was achieved by combining the gear box with the differential in a combined unit mounted across the rear axle. In 1957, following the success of Jaguar's C- and D-types at Le Mans in beginning in 1951, the brakes were upgraded to discs on all four wheels. This car came in second at the championship race at Forl√¨. Bandini also entered a two-seater at the same circuit in the sports category, but the car was forced to retire while lying third. He nevertheless won the Consuma 'climb, and placed third at the Compiano Vetto d'Enza. At this stage Ilario bought together his racing activities, his vehicle development and production, together with his dealership and service centre business into the \\"Gruppo sportivo Bandini\\" (\\"Bandini Sports Group\\"). Mid-1950s racing in the United States In America, meanwhile, in the SCCA championship, James Riley, Jim Pauley (famous for his comeback from 24th to 3rd place at Bridgehampton in 1951), Sheldon Morril and Henry Rudkin (four first and three second places in seven races, putting him second in H Modified in 1954) continued routinely to take podium places in F Modified and H Modified (FM and HM) classes in many national and international competitions on circuits and road races. Among others, these included the 50 Miles of MacDill (Florida), 100 Miles of Offutt, Thompson, Watkins Glen, Bridgehampton, Milwaukee, Wilmont, Cumberland, Elkhart Lake, Fairchild Park and Sebring. Ilario Bandini at Forl√¨ with his Formula 3 car. In 1955, Dave Michaels competing with his Bandini-Offenhauser won the 2000 cc E Modified (EM) class at Watkins, contesting on equal terms with Monzas, Maseratis, Cunninghams, and Mondials of greater engine capacity, establishing a Thompson track record by two-tenths of a second that would remain unbeaten for a year and a half. Dolph Vilardi won the 750 cc H Modified (HM) class in the US Championship with 6,000 points, beating Crosleys, Renaults, Giaurs, Panhards, Siatas, and Nardis, among other specials. The next year saw Bandini wins by Rudkin at Berverly, Yares at Watkins, Michaels at Thompson (FM and time trial) and Bob Major at Bryanfan. Tom O'Brien also registered a Bandini win at Bryanfan when he topped the 2000 cc class with an Alfa Romeo-powered car; he later became an official driver for Alfa. Also in 1956, a 750 sport siluro fitted with a David Uihlein-tuned 1250 cc MG engine, achieved two wins, two second places, a fourth, and only one retirement during the entire season. In 1957, Bandinis dominated the 750 cc H Modified (HM) category: Melvin Sachs earned an SCCA title winning 3,600 points in the class; Rudkin (who had switched to Saab power for the season) ended the year second, with 3,200; Gordon Wright was sixth with 1,800: seventh was George Tipsword on 1,400; and Jack Connoly finished tenth in the points chase with 1,000. The fame of the Bandinis was reflected by writer and screenwriter William F. Nolan's choice of the Bandini Torpedo for star billing in his 1957 short story \\"Across the old man and into Bandini\\". Mid 1950s racing in Italy In Italy Bandini was developing a car to take a Maserati power plant, as well as an O.S.C.A.-powered Formula Three model, reflecting the excellence of intra-business networking in Italy's industrial north. Meanwhile, a Bandini chassis with Zagato bodywork was prepared for Alex Raymond. A 1955 Zagato Berlinetta won the Concourse d'Elegance at Rimini in 1957. The Zagato was also the first to race in America. It ran at Sebring and Daytona Beach in 1960 (piloted by Paul Richardson for Racemaster). Bandini GT at Daytona. At Predappio, Bandini won outright in 1955 and again in 1956, in which year the team came in third overall, achieving a class win at Bologna S. Luca, third place at Consuma, a win at Compiano Vetto d'Enza and another first place at the Emilia-Romagna Automobile Club championship held at the Modena aeroautodrome, a unique development (now derelict) constructed in 1949, and combining the functions of a small commercial airfield with those of a test track for the locally based manufacturers of sports cars. 1957 saw the debut of the updated 750 sports, the 750 International Sport, known colloquially as the Saponeta (\\"little bar of soap\\"). The overall design and construction were unchanged, but track and ride height were modified, and the car received an altered rear suspension geometry. The engine was further developed, the combustion chambers being reduced in size, increasing compression and improving performance. The bodywork retained the characteristically Bandini pretty lines that prompted the Saponeta sobriquet which caught on with Italian enthusiasts. Subsequently, the same car would accommodate Bandini‚Äôs first 850 cc engine, with a mixed distribution chain and gears and a different oil pump (whose design dated to 1955): this model would later serve as a testbed for the 1000 cc engine, itself based on the 850. Garvini and Camisotti-Sintoni put in outstanding performances in the Mille Miglia, while Illario Bandini himself won the Bologna-S.Luca and achieved a seventh place in the inaugural event at Vallelunga. Another 750 International Sport driven by Massimo Bondi raced at Trento-Bondone. In 1958, the Saponeta won the Predappio-Rocca delle Camminate (with the Bandini of Achille Galassi placed second) also winning at Compiano Vetto d'Enza, maintaining the winning form demonstrated the previous year at the Modena aeroautodrome. The little car also began to winning in North America with James Eichenlaub first at Cumberland and placed second to James Thompson at Toronto. Eichenlaub also managed a third place at Watkins Glen and at Virginia, while Gene Parsons won at Miami (Florida) and again at Washington in the Congressional Cup. The team finished 1957 ranked second in the overall US classifications, having held the top spot until September when they were unable to participate at Watkins Glen following a retirement at the Virginia circuit. Drivers such as Robert Samuelson and Jack Connolly also provided exciting displays and scored outstanding results, notably at Galveston, where Connolly made an astonishing comeback in the wet, recovering 22 positions in just six laps, only to be stopped by a fuel tank rupture. During this period Bandini also experimented with a mixed 'chain and gear' driven distributor system incorporating desmodromic valves. Bandini and Bondi with \\"Bandini 750 sport internazionale\\" during a test at Modena. For 1959, Bandini achieved class victories at Compiano Vetto d'Enza (third overall), Trapani-Mount Erice, Predappio-Rocca delle Camminate, a second place at Trento-Bondone, a third at Vallelunga, and fourth in the St. Ambreus Cup (at the Monza high speed oval circuit). On top of all that, Cesenatico saw the first appearance of the Formula Junior with a new 850 cc engine (based on a project apparently originating in 1955) in a 1000P based prototype. In the same race, Edoardo Govoni took third in a 750, later achieving the same position in the Shell Cup at Vallelunga. Transformation and decline Formula Junior regulations required an 1100 cc production engine. Very belatedly (seeing Coopers had been offering mid-engined racers for sale since 1946),Kettlewell, Mike. \\"Cooper: Forerunner of the Modern Racing Car\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 4, p.428. the Bandini Formula Junior used a rear-mounted Fiat engine, tilted 15¬∞ from upright. It also featured drum brakes, and a Formula 3-style quick-change differential. The Bandini was immediately in demand in the United States. After a few months, a version with independent suspension appeared, though this was still no match for the dominating Coopers. Nevertheless, the car caught the attention of the specialist publications, of Juan Manuel Fangio, and of importer Biener, who immediately ordered five. It also gained a following with drivers such as Rodger Ward and Neil Babbs, Jr., who raced it in junior competitions until 1964, and with Roger Penske. The 850 cc engine was particularly significant because it was the first engine completely built by Bandini: it was the basis for the subsequent Bandini 1000 cc engine. The engine featured a monobloc bottom end, and choice of sidedraft or downdraught carburettors, fuel injection, or intercooled turbocharging. At the same time, Bandinis continued to appear in the United States powered by engines from Mercury, Saab, Offenhauser, MG, O.S.C.A., Alfa Romeo, and even 365 ci (6 liter) Cadillac engines (in the fashion of the Allard J2). In 1960, Ilario Bandini was invited to Daytona, where the Racemaster team took part in the famous sports car event with a ‚Äò'Saponetta'‚Äô and a Zagato-bodied Berlinetta, driven by Luckens, Richardson, and Callanan. Bandini was feted as a true \\"star\\" by CBS television: he was presented with the Keys to the City by Daytona's mayor. Noticing Bandini himself had just finished working on the team's engines, the mayor pronounced, \\"... I am happy to give this award to a man who knows how to use his hands, and not just his head.\\" Bandini and a 750 Sport Internazionale at Daytona, 1960. In Cincinnati Bandini visited the site of the former Crosley plant and was invited to relocate his operation there. Bandini stayed in the US long enough to witness Rudkin's victory at Lime Rock, but after that he preferred to return home to Forl√¨. Meanwhile, in the same year back in Italy Bandini were active in the 750, 850 and 1000 classes using Banidini DOHC front and rear engined Formnula Junior, 1000P and Saponetta models. This was the period of greatest growth for Bandini Automobiles. A contemporary newspaper reports discussion of plans under way to develop a Formula One Bandini, while the production of a prototype go-kart Bandini (with a Parilla engine) and a micro motorbike to serve as a courier for gear and spark plugs to assist rapid repairs at the racetrack. As Bandini himself reached fifty years of age, he continued to race, including at Sassi-Superga, Aosta-Pila (second), Vergato- Cereglio, and Cesenatico. In the latter, he was joined by Guerino Lelli (fifth in a 750), Teodoro Zeccoli (out after breaking a sleeve of the 1000cc), and Edward Govoni (out after cracking the differential while his 850 lay third). Giorgio Cecchini finished third at Vallelunga in an 850, and Alberto Canali third at Salsomaggiore Monte S. Antonio in a 1000 sports. While in 1961 the United States welcomed Bandini, Dave Lang (thanks to three victories and a second place that allowed him to take third place in the SCCA's HM Class Championship without even entering subsequent races) led national standings, twenty points up on Osca, in Italy are left engines of one liter engine capacity or less. Bandini himself had little luck in the Four Hours of Pescara (valid for the World Sports Car Championship), co-driving with Alberto Canali, but saw Cecchini and Cesare Sangiorgi classified sixth. Vince him to Reggio Emilia is the seventh to Salsomaggiore Terme-S.Antonio fifth Vallelunga and second at Predappio where Cecchini won, also in a Bandini 1000. Ilario Bandini with a 1000 cc engine. Cecchini placed the fourth in Salsomaggiore, forced to retire after a fuel pump failure in the lead at Asiago, and after taking the pole position at Vallelunga suffered clutch failure one lap from the flag. He came fourth at Parma-Poggio of Berceto, sixth in the Shell Trophy at Vallelunga, and third at Trento Bondone. Take part also to Sicily Tour. Race in the same year also Canali and Lelli with the Formula Junior. In 1962, Scuderia Bandini joined with Team Arcangeli, and Bandini himself ran a 1000 cc, earning back-to-back class wins in Chieti (third overall), repeating at the Gallenga (Rome) cup event and Vinci-S.Baronto (coming third in the Junior). He also won in Predappio and Reggio Emilia while the fourth is at Bologna-Raticosa and Vallelunga and reaches the sixth Consuma. Giorgio Cechini in his Bandini took revenge at Vallelunga (recording the first absolute fastest lap), the third cup of Asiago, the second trophy settecolli (Vallelunga) and fifth at Bologna-Raticosa. The 100GT was born in 1963, with bodywork by Corna, subcontractor of Zagato. At Predappio, Lelli topped Cecchini by coming third again with the 1000 sports, while Hilary placed fifth at Consuma (substantiating world sport) and took the Shell Trophy at Vallelunga. 1964 was the year of four for Bandini, finishing in this position at the Predappio-Rocca delle walks (preceded by Bandinis of Cecchini and Benelli) and at Ascoli-Colle S. Marco. He is also fourth Trento-Bondone (valid for the European mountain championship), again behind Benelli, and the Cup Beans at Osimo (preceded by Cecchini). Benelli was third in the Cuneo (Garessio-hill St. Bernard), the Cup of Cimino (in Rome), according to Teramo and Bolzano-Mendola, while finishing ninth at Vallelunga, and retiring for breach of the exchange at the Targa Florio. At year-end, awards League team of social intervene personally Lorenzo Bandini (not a relative, despite the same name) and Enzo Ferrari (very reluctant to come out of Modena) to witness the sympathy and esteem of the \\"Drake\\" Ilario for Bandini. Ilario Bandini and Enzo Ferrari in Forl√¨ in 1964. Lorenzo Bandini rewards Ilario Bandini. In 1965, a version of the 1000P (unusually, Belgian racing yellow) gave Benelli a win at the Predappio hillclimb and the first Castione Baratti (Parma) then runs Paganelli with the Trento-Bondone Cesana and Sestriere. Cecchini with a front-engined 1000 ran close second to Predappio and retired at the Mugello road circuit. Benelli came fifth in the Shell Trophy at Vallelunga (Bandini himself eighth), retired in the Targa Florio, took third at Vergato Cereglio, and above all keeps Bandini in the limelight with a fourth and valid proof for world title on the Mugello road course. Despite engines enlarged to 850 cc, and remaining unbeaten from 1961 until 1963 in SCCA's South-West Division championship (led by Hugh Grammar and T. Hotchkiss, who in latter years won in F. Junior at Sebring), in the mid-1960s, production for the United States was stopped for lack of adequate funding, radical changes of regulations, unfunded riscuotibili, and competition from large manufacturers. Many Italian manufacturers were in crisis, and Bandini made front dedicated exclusively to producing prototypes intended mainly as privateers for Italian \\"gentleman drivers\\" who mainly run hillclimbs (a throwback to the 1930s, in an era of increasing costs, professionalism, and specialization). There was no wavering in continual improvement on the technical side, so in 1966, a new mid-engined Bandini 1000 appeared. A barchetta with new, pleasant lines and Colotti gearbox, the position of theupdated one liter engine representing the biggest change. This car persisted into the mid-seventies, when it was donated by Bandini to the town of Forli, which still holds it. Engine and gearbox of the mid-engined 1000. In 1968, at the Turin Exhibition of Sports Cars, the new Berlinetta Saloncino was presented. It proved unsuccessful at Mugello the same year, came out in street trim and later was further amended slightly in front of the body. A new 1000V sports prototype was born in 1970 with the unusual solution to the carburetors at the centre of the head in an upright position. After two years, the 1000SP introduced Bandini's first aerodynamic element, a rear wing. At the whip of Dolcetti, Ghini, Benelli, Gatta, Ferrucci, recent prototypes have won the Cup Water Cerelia, Camucia-Cortona, the Colle S. Bartolo (PU), the Gubbio-Madonna della Cima, the Cup of Chianti (half kilo of underweight) and seized countless placements: Trieste-Opicina, Bologna- Raticosa, Ascoli-hill St. Marco, Castione Passo della Presolana, circuit of Mugello, Targa Florio, Magione and many other races (predominantly hillclimbs) throughout the country. Bandini, in his seventies, as well as dealing with restoration of older models, continued the study of new ones. The company in 1980 presented the 1300 with 16 valves, mechanical fuel injection, and electronic ignition; after chassis, engines and flying, now also looking alloy wheels are facts and carry the signature Bandini. Il padrone surrounded with Bandini engines. In 1975, Bandini hosted the Group Bandini, an exhibition dedicated to the marque, for drivers who had worked successfully for him. Until 1979, appearing in Forl√¨ included Formula One World Driving Champions James Hunt (1976 for McLaren) and Niki Lauda (1977 for Ferrari) In addition to tens of thousands of visitors. Bandini was also decisive in the resumption of the Predappio-Rocca delle Camminate hillclimb at Forl√¨ in 1978, after being interrupted ten years earlier. In 1981, Bandini received from New York University an honoris causa (honorary doctorate) in mechanical engineering, while a Bandini is inducted at the Museum of Marconi in Los Angeles. This is followed by further rewards, such as the gold medal of the Municipality of Forl√¨ and the medal allocation from Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) \\"as proper recognition of many years carried out in favour of Italian sport.\\" In 1985, Bandini took the wheel a last time, at the Predappio hillclimb in his 1300. Ilario Bandini and mille (1000) turbo. A few years later came his final creation, the Berlinetta 1000 turbo 16v, at the age of 80, just before his death off at Forl√¨ on 12 April 1992. Ten years after his death, Forl√¨ named a square in his honour. The Registry Bandini preserves historical documentation, history, and ten Bandini cars, to perpetrate the memory of one brand of cars of the past that has contributed to enhancing the reputation of Italian cars, but especially the memory of a person who has made his life means to achieve their dreams.

History  Originally a mission of the parish of St. John's, York Mills, it was one of the earliest Anglican churches in North Toronto. While the mission congregation began meeting in Leaside in the 1860s, it later moved to the area of Deer Park. Today, the parish is known largely for its tradition of choral music. In 1911, the parish of Grace Church on-the-Hill was carved out of the Christ Church parish boundaries. In 1970, the church was the site of the ordination to the priesthood of Andrew Hutchison, who would later serve as Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. On January 1, 2018, the Rev. Canon Cheryl Palmer became the Rector of Christ Church Deer Park.http://www.christchurchdeerpark.org/clergy.htm The previous Rector was the Rev. Canon Kevin Robertson, who was consecrated Area Bishop of York- Scarborough in January 2017.http://www.toronto.anglican.ca/about-the- diocese/area-bishops/york-scarborough/ Gallery File:TorontoDeerParkView.jpgView of Deer Park (Lawton Park & Christ Church) looking north, from 1878 Atlas.

Principal among these is the Intelligence propaganda during the war implied alleged torture at a massive scale of Indian and Allied prisoners of war by the INA troops in collaboration with the Japanese. A strongly opposed view has emerged after the war, especially within India, based on the motivations of the troops who formed the INA, where a predominant view was held, and still holds, of the INA as patriots and revolutionaries. Outside India it is not widely known, and the accounts and views on the INA, especially among the Allied servicemen who served in Burma, are diametrically opposite. However, almost no account of the Indian independence movement ignores the INA. Other controversies have risen on the contributions of the INA to India's independence, the treatment of INA troops in Independent India, as well as the conditions of expatriate Indians who joined the INA. Axis collaboration Breaking Oath Different historians have cited other reasons for the INA's recruits volunteering to serve with the Japanese enemy. These included both the ideal of wanting to fight for India's independence, the inevitable desire not to be interned in the POW camp, as well as ambition. Some cite the destruction and devaluation of the Raj's prestige and authority in the Malayan debacle and the humiliating surrender at Singapore that first shook the Sepoys' loyalty to the Raj. In addition, a number of authors have cited the disparity in the service conditions (including scopes of progression in the army) and treatment of white and Indian troops within the army as another reason for ill-feelings within the Indian troops. Further reason cited by Both Fay and Lebra and other authors indicate monetary and situational scopes, as well as the resentment at the abandonment of the Indian troops at Singapore by their White comrades and the officers. Controversy exists as to what was actually said by Col J.C. Hunt in the first of the three speeches during the surrender ceremony for the Indian troops at Farrer Park on 17 February 1942. Fay writes in 1993 that a number of the troops gathered at the park remembers Hunt as having told the troops that they now belonged to the Japanese army and should obey their orders while Hunt only remembers having said that they were all Prisoners of War of the Japanese Nevertheless, Fay also points out that the fact that they were all POWs was already self-evident, and the fact that they were addressed separately implies some significance. A number of INA veterans present at the ceremony have said that, for the Indian troops, this also fed a feeling of devaluation (handed over like cattle, as Shah Nawaz Khan later put it), abandonment and of dishonour on part of the British high command that they perceived to have served loyalty. In the days and years to come, a number of INA men cited this act of abandonment a major reason to join the first INA. Others, especially the officer corps including the Indian Commissioned Officers (ICOs) and Viceroy's Commissioned Officers (VCOs) have said that they initially joined the first INA to prevent any possible ill-treatment of their subordinate Indian soldiers. When Singapore fell, eyewitness reports suggested \\"rows of Indian POWs were shot\\" by the Japanese.Singapore's Changi Museum records undeniable history However, all authors agree that Subhas Chandra Bose's charismatic leadership and persona was probably also amongst the most significant factors that drew the recruits of the second INA and was key in transforming it into a cohesive fighting force. A large number of Indian soldiers did not join the army and remained as PoWs. Many were sent to work in the Death Railway and suffered hardships under Japanese internment, and nearly eleven thousand died. Many of these soldiers, cited the oath of alleigance they had taken to the King as a reason not to join a Japanese-supported organisation, and regarded the recruits of the INA as being traitors. Commanders in the British-Indian Army like Wavell later highlighted the hardships this group of soldiers suffered, contrasting them with the troops of the INA. Collaboration During the war, the associations of the INA with the Japanese, and circulating stories of it being a small force of turncoats, of participations in outrages by Japanese forces and other stories meant that a number of Congress leaders viewed what it knew about the INA as a traitor army. In addition, a number of Congress Leaders, including Gandhi, announced the Japanese as unwelcome. Other political forces, including the Indian Communist Party and its members viewed the INA as fascist-collaborators, and was instrumental in helping the British Indian police and security forces track down INA agents landed in India by submarine or Parachute during the war. Amongst the allied troops who fought in South-east Asia the predominant opinion of the INA, especially in the accounts of the war in the popular accounts of British and Australian servicemen of the war in Burma, is of a contemptuous auxiliary force that was a totally ineffective fighting force and composed of cowards and brutes who sought opportunities to desert The army intelligence service in India, when it became aware of the establishment and existence of the INA, was also faced with the possibilities of the sepoys of the Eastern Army (as the 14th Army was called then) deserting. It was also during this time that the intelligence started coming in possession of accounts of torture and ill-treatment meted out to Allied troops and PoWs by the Japanese forces in Burma. During the war, the psychological warfare section of the India Command under Lt Colonel Hunt, known as GSI(q), to propaganda against the INA. and British commander and officers of the 14th Army were instructed to allude to the existence of the INA to the frontline Indian troops. These were also to include references to the army as an auxiliary force to the Japanese forces, as well as that they were collaborators and traitors. After the war, Allied PoWs, as well as Indian PoWs who did not join the INA, described bitter memories of labour camps and ill- treatment in the hands of Japanese forces. In addition, the war time intelligence work and propaganda had described the INA to the media, incorrectly, as a small force of deserters from among a large majority of Indian PoWs who remained loyal to the Raj and refused to join. In addition, the propaganda work also associated the INA with Japanese atrocities on allied PoWs and local populace. These allegations were not corrected or withdrawn at the end of the war. Allegations of torture Allegations of torture by the INA were also made during the war. Fay, however, notes that these allegations were not borne out by the number of men charged with torture at the Red Fort trials, nor by the charges against them. In the first INA trials, Fay notes the three men were charged with Murder and abetment to murder of troops of the INA itself who had attempted to desert, and argues that this had been in an open process based on the INA's own laws, drawn from the Indian Army Act, 1911, noting the court found the three men not guilty. However, Fay also describes the some of later ones of the ten or so trials, most prominently that of Burhan-ud-Din of Chitral and others, where the allegations of torture on Fay's opinion were justified. Nevertheless, Fay argues that these made up a few instances and by no means match up to the large scale torture alleged and concludes these to be war-time intelligence manoeuvres of the Jiffs campaign. Some have also made allegations of complicity in the Selarang Barracks Incident at Singapore in 1942, where INA guards are alleged to have shot four Australian PoWs who had attempted to escape from Changi Prison. Independent India Indian independence It has been argued by a number of historians, contemporary and modern, that the preparations for British withdrawal from India had already begun before World War II started, and the INA or the movements arising out of it achieved nothing. Others have however argued that although the will to relinquish the Raj may have existed already, but the events of the Red Fort trials, the Bombay mutiny and destabilisation within the armed forces were a principal reason for the hasty end to the Raj even in the face of dismal political scene. The INA has also been criticized since a military success by the INA and its allies, would have probably led to bondage for India and the rest of South East Asia to Japan. Within India, the story of the Army was seen at the time, and still seen, both as fascinating story as well as a turning-point in the movement for Independence. After the ban on the INA was lifted on 10 May, it was seen as the first \\"national\\" force not decreed by caste and religion. As Sumit Sarkar puts it, its biggest impact was on the patriotic imagination of an army fighting for the country's independence, led by a Bengalee- the least \\"Martial\\" of India's \\"races\\" in traditional British stereotype. Reports and tales on the INA emerged in the national and vernacular press, after the ban on reporting the INA was lifted in April 1945, along with this the coverage of the Red Fort trials engendered much public agitations and support for the troops and quickly became a major driving force in the closing days of the Independence Movement. The INA's war cries of \\"Chalo Delhi\\" (on to Delhi) and most of all \\"Jai Hind\\" became the cries of the independence movement, and of protesters demanding their release. Jai Hind has since been adopted as India's National slogan, an official salutation in the Indian Armed Forces, as well as the closing salutation of the Prime Minister's Independence day address at Red Fort. It is also an extremely popular patriotic greeting. INA in modern Indian history A further controversy exists, especially within India, with regards to the attitude and treatment towards the INA by the post-1947 Governments of India as well as the omission of the events of September 1945-46 from the historical records of the independence movement. Nehru, in 1948, refused to readmit the men of the INA to the Indian Army after independence. He cited the break in the service of the ex-INA men, as well as the effects on the Indian Army of taking ex-INA troops into their ranks. However, it has been noted that as late as 1948, considerable pro-INA sentiments existed in the army as well as public psyche, attracting strong dissatisfactions from members of Nehru's cabinet. Defence Minister Sardar Baldev Singh is on record as having commented on the need to strengthen the morale of the Indian army A history of the army and of Azad Hind, written by Indian historian Pratul Chandra Gupta in 1950s at the request of the Indian Government, was subsequently classified and not released until 2006. Freedom fighters pension Also, although Nehru promised pensions, the men of the INA were not eligible for the Freedom Fighters Pension till 1972. A number of people, notably ex-members of the INA and sympathetic groups have accused the Nehru, Mountbatten, and subsequently successive Congress governments, of largely ignoring and not-recognising the role of the INA, as well as the events surrounding it between 1945‚Äì46, in the history of the Independence movement. These have been compounded by a number of conspiracy-theories and news reports in the past on agreements between the Indian political leadership to hand over its leader Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal if he was found to be alive. Later historians have, however, argued that given the political aim and nature of the entire Azad Hind movement especially the Indian National Army, Nehru's decisions may have been to prevent politicisation of the army and assert civilian authority over the military. Further criticisms have been made in recent years for the general hardships and apathy surrounding the conditions of ex-INA troops including, for example, the circumstances surrounding the death and funeral of Ram Singh Thakur, the composer of Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja. Expatriate stateless veterans Also, criticisms have been made for the lack of recognition afforded to the expatriate Indians, notably Burmese Indians, who joined the INA and were not repatriated to India at the end of the war. Most are not recognised as Indian citizens, and not recognised as citizens in their adopted countries, effectively being stateless people. Azad Hind treasures Further controversy relates to the fate of the Azad Hind fortune. Bose is said to have been travelling with it during his last known journey. The treasure, a considerable amount of gold ornaments and gems, is said to have been recovered from Bose's belongings following the fatal plane crash in Formosa that reportedly killed him. Despite repeated warnings from Indian diplomats in Tokyo, Nehru is said to have disregarded allegations that men previously associated with Azad Hind misappropriated the funds for personal benefit. Some of these are said to have travelled to Japan repeatedly with the approval of Nehru government and were later given government roles implementing Nehru's political and economic agenda. A very small portion of the alleged treasure was repatriated to India in 1950s. References *Patriots, Not Traitors.

Occupied from the mid-18th to early 19th century, the site gives an important window into the relations between the Navajo and the Puebloans of that time. First explored archaeologically in 1939, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Description The Big Bead Mesa site is located in a remote area between Grants, New Mexico and the Jemez Pueblo northwest of Albuquerque. The main areas of the site are located along the northeastern edge of a large mesa, which extends northeast from Grants and includes Mount Taylor. The name of the site is derived from fossilized beads found at the base of the mesa in significant numbers by the local Navajo. The site consists of a large fortified village, with about 90 hogan sites identified. It extends along two tongues of the mesa, split by a wide complex of arroyo ravines. The hogans are clustered in small groups, each of which is accompanied by secondary structures such as sweat lodges, food cache areas, and fortifications. In two places there are open formations that are interpreted as dance grounds used for ceremonial purposes. Fortifications include an extensive wall that nearly cuts off one portion of the settlement. Access to the area below the mesa rim was possible, but likely required the use of ladders. The site was occupied by the Navajo from about 1745 to 1812. At the time, they were allied to the Apache, and the site presented a threatening posture to the nearby Jemez and Acoma Puebloan settlements. The site is an important window into the movements of the Navajo and their relationships to the surrounding tribes.

He was originally signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent in 2004 and ended his five-year NFL career on the Houston Texans. He played college football at Brigham Young University. High school Jackson was a star offensive lineman for Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in Rolling Hills Estates, California. A three-year letterwinner, Jackson was named all-west, all-state and Los Angeles Times Lineman of the Year as a senior. He graduated from Peninsula High School in 1997. He was heavily recruited by Stanford, USC, Cal, UCLA, Washington, and Colorado State ultimately choosing to accept a full scholarship to BYU. College career Jackson reshirted his freshman year at Brigham Young University in 1997. After returning from a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jackson started at center position. A broken fibula caused him to miss most of the 2000 season, and a knee injury cut his 2001 season short. During his junior year (2002), Jackson earning All-Mountain West Conference honors his senior season. At the 2004 NFL Scouting Combine, Jackson ran the 40-yard dash in 4.94 seconds, the fastest of any offensive lineman at the Combine. Professional career Tampa Bay Buccaneers Undrafted in the 2004 NFL Draft, Jackson was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a free agent. Jackson failed to make the active roster out of training camp, but was signed to the team's practice squad, where he remained the rest of the season. In 2005, Jackson again was signed to the practice squad following training camp, then was promoted to the active roster after the fourth game. A backup to the guard and center positions, Jackson did not appear in a game. In the 2006 preseason, Jackson showed impressive improvement over his earlier preseason form and earned public praise from Buccaneers head coach John Gruden, however, Jackson was again cut by Tampa Bay and signed to its practice squad. Prior to the first game, however, injuries to other offensive linemen forced Jackson to again be promoted to the active roster, with the Buccaneers cutting former standout wide receiver David Boston to make room for him. Jackson saw no action, and was cut within days to make room for a long snapper, again being re-signed to the practice squad. Houston Texans A month later, Jackson was signed from Tampa Bay's practice squad by the Houston Texans. Jackson finished the 2006 season on the Texans' active roster, but did not see action in a regular season game. A season-ending shoulder injury during the 2007 training camp sidelined him on the Texans' injured reserve. After a foot injury during the 2008 preseason, Jackson underwent surgery and retired from the NFL in 2009. Personal life Scott Jackson and his son Tyler at the 2008 Houston Walk Now for Autism. Jackson served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the Spanish-speaking residents in the Dallas area in 1998 and 1999. He is an Eagle Scout. Scott married Ashley McKinnon of Winter Park, Florida in 2002. Together they have four boys. Education During his time in the NFL, Jackson participated in several NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial programs: Northwestern in 2005, Stanford in 2007 and Harvard in 2008. After retiring from the NFL, Jackson entered the Class of 2012 at the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia. Following graduation, Jackson accepted a position with Boston Consulting Group. He and his family currently live in Houston.

History The college was founded by two brothers, Benjamin W. and James W. Lewis. The Lewis family were active members of the Methodist Church and supporters of the Union during the Civil War. They helped form a new congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Glasgow and a school named Lewis High School was started in the basement of the church, directed by the minister, Rev. D.A. McCready. Benjamin Lewis died in 1866 and left $10,000 in his will to maintain a library. His family erected the building and incorporated as Lewis College and Library Association in 1867. The library building was deeded to the Missouri Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The college opened in the fall of 1867 with 140 students and classes were held in the library. Enrollment was open to both male and female students. Lewis College soon moved in 1869 to buildings across the street from the library that were previously used by Pritchett College. Lewis College moved in December, 1882 to the Lewis family mansion, Glen Eden. The institution operated for another decade, closing by 1892. Lewis Library Lewis Library continues in use today.

It is an important palaeontological site,C.Michael Hogan, Mark L. Cooke and Helen Murray, The Waterberg Biosphere , Lumina Technologies, 22 May 2006. with the local limeworks containing Australopithecus-bearing deposits dating to between 3.0 and 2.6 million years BP. The whole Makapan Valley has been declared a South African Heritage Site. Makapansgat belongs to the Cradle of Humankind. Makapansgat Valley sites Makapansgat limeworks This is the oldest of the cave sites in the Makapansgat valley, spanning an age of greater than 4.0 million years until perhaps 1.6 million years ago. This site has yielded many thousands of fossil bones, amongst which were found remains of the gracile australopithecine Australopithecus africanus. The A. africanus fossils are suggested to date to between 2.85 and 2.58 million years ago based on palaeomagnetism by Andy Herries (La Trobe University, Australia). The site was recently excavated by a joint project between the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and Arizona State University in the US. Cave of Hearths and Hyaena Mandible Cave The Cave of Hearths is close to the Historic Cave complex and preserves a remarkably complete record of human occupation from Early Stone Age ‚ÄúAcheulian‚Äù times in the oldest sediments through the Middle Stone Age, the Later Stone Age and up to the Iron Age. Nineteenth century European relics such as brass ware and musket balls were found at the surface when excavations started. The site was re-excavated and re-analysed as part of the 'Makapan Middle Pleistocene Research Project' run by the University of Liverpool (UK) between 1996 and 2001. This work has shown that coloured sediment horizons in the Early Stone Age levels are not from fire use. A Homo mandible also recovered from these layers may also represent one of the earliest representatives of Homo sapiens. Buffalo Cave A small number of fossils were thought to have been collected by Dr Robert Broom from this site in 1937, including the remains of an extinct 'pygmy buffalo', Bos makapania, for which the cave is named. More recent excavations have revealed an extensive 'Cornelian Land Mammal Age' fauna including antelope, horses, pigs, monkeys and carnivores. The fauna, along with palaeomagnetic age estimates by Andy Herries (La Trobe University, Australia) suggest an age of between 990,000 and 780,000 years for the main fossil bearing layers. Basal flowstone deposits are estimated to go back to around 2 million years and show evidence for the beginning of the 'Walker circulation' at around 1.7 million years ago. Ficus Cave and Iron Age Site The cave gets its name from the fig tree Ficus ingens roots which curtain its entrance. This cave contains Iron Age and 19th century relics, a large bat colony and an underground lake. An Iron Age site close by yields occupational debris from approximately Early Iron Age (550 AD), 870 AD and the Late Iron Age (1560 AD). The slopes adjacent to the cave are artificially terraced and archaeological finds from these include potsherds, grindstones, hammer stones and relics of iron smelting operations, including ore, slag and fragments of tuyeres. Peppercorn's Cave This cave contains Iron Age and ancient relics and an underground lake. It is also home to a large colony of migratory long-fingered bats, Miniopterus schreibersii. Rainbow Cave This cave is situated immediately below the Historic Cave and contains the remains of several putative hearths, suggesting both human occupation and the controlled use of fire. The exposed sediments have yielded Middle Stone Age artefacts of the Pietersburg Culture of between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. Recent studies have shown that the coloured horizons are not hearths but are more likely ancient pool deposits. Historic Cave or Makapansgat This site lies immediately adjacent to the Cave of Hearths, and preserves Iron Age and Mfecane relics. It is most famous as the clash between a Boer Commando and local Langa and Kekana people after the murders of Voortrekkers at Moorddrift, Mapela and Pruizen. Chief Makapan (Mokopane), together with a large number of his tribespeople and their cattle were besieged in the cave for nearly a month between 25 October and 21 November 1854, during which time many hundreds died of hunger and thirst.. Piet Potgieter was shot during the siege and the name of the nearby town was changed from Vredenburg to 'Pieter Potgietersrust', which later changed to 'Potgietersrus'. As of early 21st century (ca. early 2000s), after the transition from the Apartheid government into majority rule, there has been a trend to rename several national and provincial government institutions (including educational institutions), roads, public infrastructures, towns, cities, etc. As a result, the town has been controversially re-renamed to Mokopane, in honour of Chief Mokopane. The cave was proclaimed a National Monument in 1936. Cold Air Cave Stable isotope analyses of a uranium- series-dated stalagmite from Cold Air Cave provided a record of climate changes for the periods 4400‚Äì4000 years and approximately 800 years ago until the present day. Gutentight Cave This cave was located and explored in 2000 by A. Herries, A. Latham and W. Murzel. After breaking through a number of tight squeezes, the cave opened out into a large chamber. The floor of the chamber was covered in hearths. An inscription on the wall of the cave was from the 19th Century and indicated that a previous entrance to the cave had collapsed and sealed the cavity after this date. Murzel's Cave This cave was located and explored in 1998 by A. Herries and A. Latham. Digging out of the entrance led to a climb and traverse down into a series of lower decorated chambers.Herries, A.I.R., Latham, A.G., 1999. New caves in the Makapansgat area of the Northern Province of South Africa. Caves and Caving. 85, 18‚Äì19. Katzenjammer Cave or Herries' Hole Katzenjammer Cave is located adjacent to Peppercorn's Cave. An entrance shaft leads down to a narrow climb and entrance to a network of passages at the same level as the far reaches of Peppercorn's Cave. The entrance shaft has formed by the collapse of fossil bearing deposits (including the Giant Dasie) into the lower modern cave system, Katzenjammer Cave. The entrance shaft area and fossil deposits were collectively termed Herries' Hole by the Makapan Middle Pleistocene Research Project. History of discoveries in Makapansgat Valley Makapansgat Valley has been described as having one of the greatest palaeontological records of human evolution in the world. Collecting at the site began in 1925, when a local school teacher, Wilfred Eitzman, was attracted by the activities of limeworkers. Some fossil material was sent to Raymond Dart, who initiated a systematic investigation in 1947. Paperback Eitzman also discovered the so- called \\"Makapansgat pebble\\" associated with the bones. Ca. 3,000,000 BCE, the pebble is shaped naturally to resemble a human face, it is thought to have been found by an Australopithecus and carried from its source into the Makapansgat cave. It has been suggested that this pebble represents the earliest known example of symbolic thinking of early hominids. The rocks that Professor Dart received from Mr Eitzman turned out to contain, amongst others, blackened fossil bones which led him to believe that they had been burnt. Although no hominid remains or stone tools were found at first, he concluded that these were the remains of bones burnt in fireplaces and therefore that Makapansgat was a site of early hominid occupation. Dart named the first hominids discovered at the site Australopithecus prometheus after the mythological Greek hero who stole fire from the Gods. Afterwards the black markings turned out to be manganese stains and Australopithecus prometheus were recognised as specimens of Australopithecus africanus. After analysing 7,159 fossil bones, Dart concluded that these creatures, in an era before stone tools were discovered, used tools made from bone, teeth and horn, naming it the Osteodontokeratic Culture. In 1936, the Historical Monuments Commission was asked to declare Makapan's Cave a National Monument and Professor Clarence van Riet Lowe, Secretary of the commission and Director of the Archaeological Survey of the Union of South Africa, visited the site in 1937. He inspected the Historic Cave and discovered, close by, an abandoned limeworker‚Äôs adit that cut through a calcified cave infill. In this infill he saw fossil bones, stone tools, and what he took to be ash horizons representing ancient hearths. At first he referred to it as part of Makapan's Cave, but he later renamed it \\"The Cave of Hearths\\". Further research during June and October 1937 revealed the Rainbow Cave. The site was visited by Clarence Van Riet Lowe, Raymond Dart, and Robert Broom. H. B. S. Cooke of the Geology Department of the University of the Witwatersrand conducted a geological survey of the area (1941) followed by L. C. King in 1951. In July 1945, Philip Tobias led a group of students to the valley, where they discovered the \\"Hyaena Cave\\" next to Van Riet Lowe's site. Further down the valley, from a cave next to the limeworks, they collected a large fossil horse's lower jaw, which supplied a name for the ‚ÄúCave of the Horse's Mandible‚Äù. After these discoveries, Dr Bernard Price made a research grant available for systematic excavations, which started at the Cave of Hearths in 1947, with field work being carried out by Guy Gardiner, James Kitching, and his brothers Ben and Scheepers. One of the most significant discoveries was a Homo lower jaw from Bed 3, by Ben. In 1953, Dr R. J. Mason was placed in charge of the excavations. The stratigraphic sequence was determined during 1953‚Äì1954. After the Kitching brothers discovered an ape-man braincase amongst the limeworks dumps in 1947, Dart organised for the lime miner's dumps to be hand-sorted to recover as much fossil-bearing material as possible. After 45 years of research, many thousands of fossils from this site have been identified and catalogued. Brian Maguire studied rocks which were brought into the caves during prehistoric times (1965, 1968, 1980). He interpreted this to represent rudimentary stone tool making activities dated at around 2.3 ‚Äì 1.6 million years ago, however, recent analysis has shown this information to be incorrect. Recent work at the sites in the late 1990s and early 2000s was done by these groups: * the Makapansgat Fieldschool, run jointly by Kaye Reed of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University (US) and Kevin Kuykendall of the University of the Witwatersrand (SA) and later the University of Sheffield (UK); * the Makapan Middle Pleistocene Research project, run by Anthony Sinclair, Patrick Quinney of the University of Liverpool (UK) and later John McNabb of the University of Southampton (UK.). * Alf Latham, Ginette Warr (University of Liverpool), and Andy Herries (La Trobe University, Australia) did Geochronological and stratigraphic work for both projects.

Issues The Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Saudi Arabia focuses on five main issues regarding the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. * Political reform * Religious freedom * Women's rights * Minority rights * Economic reform Political reform The center supports the promotion of a democratically governed Saudi Arabia. Due to its influence on an estimated 1.2 billion Muslims around the world, and its location with relation to the world's oil market, The Center believes that \\"Saudi Arabia cannot be disregarded or surrendered to an absolute monarchy that encourages the oppression of women and religious minorities, and fosters domestic extremism and international terrorism.\\"Political Reform , cdhr.info By creating a constitutional, democratic government paired with the rule of law, CDHR feels that a more prosperous and united Saudi Arabia will emerge, which is not only for the best interest for the Saudi people, but the United States and all other democratic societies. In order to do this, CDHR has consulted with democratic and constitutional experts and has devoted itself to creating a \\"blueprint\\" for a new democratic political structure in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have proposed the following steps in doing so: > The holding of full and fair, internationally verified municipal elections > as a first step towards the complete democratization of the Saudi political > system. Regional and national elections are to follow local elections. All > citizens of voting age should have the right to vote, regardless of gender, > race, ethnicity or religious orientation, at all levels of the democratic > process (locally, regionally, and nationally). Representation at all levels > of government is to be directly proportional to the percentage of the vote > obtained in the elections by any candidate or party. To ensure fair > political representation of both individuals and regions, the number of > seats available for each body of government should be prescribed by the > Constitution and directly related to the results of a regularly and > independently held National Census. The new political structure is to be > designed so that each of the five main regions enjoys equal representation > at the national level in a legislative body. A non-sectarian national > Constitution should be voted on and approved in a referendum by all citizens > of voting age and thereafter upheld by a politically independent > Constitutional Court. The national Constitution should be amendable only by > an affirmative vote of an increased majority in the national representative > bodies, followed by regional ratification. Military, police, information > agencies and militias, both regional and national, should be under civilian > authority and employed only for national or regional security and defense > priorities and for the protection of citizens‚Äô rights and safety.

All > levels of Saudi Government should adhere to highest standards of > transparency and accountability. The holy shrines in Makkah (Mecca) and > Madinah (Medina) should have their own elected governing council with > representatives from all Muslim countries. This council‚Äôs mandate will be > limited to religious affairs and it will have no political influence in the > affairs of the Saudi state. By making these changes, The Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Saudi Arabia believes that the people in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will embrace democracy,a free market economy, tolerance, and in turn share in extreme productivity economically and socially. Religious freedom Religious freedom is an important issue for the center. It is forbidden to practice any other religion in The Kingdom other than Wahhabism, which is the state- sanctioned interpretation of Islam. Representative of an estimated one percent of Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism is considered by most to be and extremist sect of Islam that openly sponsors terrorism and the persecution of other religions. While modest efforts have been made by the Saudi government to modernize their strict adherence to Wahhabism and to try to separate themselves from the negative aspects of this brand of Islam(2008 Interfaith Conference. Madrid, Spain), CDHR believes that ‚Äúunless the international community takes concrete measures to discourage the Saudi institutions from promoting religious hatred in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world, the consequences could be catastrophic.‚ÄùReligious Freedom , cdhr.info Women's rights Women in Saudi Arabia are less represented in political, social, economic and scientific fields than women in any other Arab or Muslim country. Women were barred from participating in the only municipal elections in the history of the Saudi State in 2005. They are prohibited from studying certain subjects in schools, such as chemistry and biology. They may not legally drive and must obtain ‚Äúpermission‚Äù from a male ‚Äúguardian‚Äù to travel within or outside the country. Women must ride in the back of public buses, even when the buses are empty. Saudi girls are not allowed to play sports in schools, which, by Saudi health official admission, is causing health problems and staggering expenses. All marriages are arranged by male relatives. If a Saudi woman divorces her husband, she loses custody of her children over age six. Women have little or no freedom to prosecute sexual abuse cases, being required to produce four witnesses. In court, a woman's testimony is equivalent to half that of a man's. These conditions violate women's human rights and have devastating personal and social effects. These exclusionary policies have created an imbalanced environment that is hurting Saudi society and Muslim women across the globe. Such policies favor the views of extremist- leaning segments in the Saudi society. CDHR promotes the empowerment of Saudi women to become equal partners in the democratic development process in Saudi Arabia. As activists, elected officials, and constituents, the contributions of women are crucial to building a strong and vibrant society that embraces tolerance and rejects extremism and terrorism. Empowering women in Saudi Arabia is a moral imperative and a powerful path to promoting progress, tolerance and democracy in the country. The alliance between the Saudi ruling dynasty and its extremist religious allies is at the heart of Saudi exclusion and mistreatment of women. The royal family has traditionally used a conservative brand of Sunni Islam (Wahhabism) to justify its rule. Present-day Saudi Arabia was founded by an alliance between Muhammad ibn Saud, great grandfather of the current ruling dynasty, and Muhammad Abd al-Wahhab, the founder and father of Wahhabism in the middle of the eighteenth century. Wahhabi religious police have free rein to enforce their interpretation of religious law, and Saudi women face severe restrictions in the political, economic, and social spheres. Women cannot directly write freely, or assemble and organize against restrictions. The system has stifled the development of the country and kept its citizens divided. Increased participation by Saudi women will tilt the balance in favor of tolerant policies that are in the best interest of all Saudi citizens and the international community. With Saudi Arabia's religious and economic influence regionally and globally, empowering women in Saudi Arabia will increase chances for democratic reforms in other Arab and Muslim societies worldwide. Economic reform The problem of discrimination against Saudi Arabia's religious minorities is compounded by the Saudi regime's restrictive and inhumane policies towards the country's nearly nine million foreigners, or one-third of the population of Saudi Arabia, who live and work in the country without any rights or recognition under the law. The vast majority of these expatriates have fled their own poverty-stricken or war-torn countries in Africa and Asia, such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sudan, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The 2004 report by the Saudi Statistics Department of the Ministry of Economy and Planning acknowledges that non-Saudis account for 67% of the Kingdom's labor force, while it is estimated expatriates hold 85‚Äì90% of the private sector jobs. There is no minimum wage and workers do not have the right to organize or strike. In 2004, Human Rights Watch reported that they had encountered both women and men working in conditions resembling slavery. Female workers coming to Saudi Arabia to work as domestic servants often endure the most severe conditions. Upon arrival, they may find that the contracts they signed in their home countries are disregarded and they are forced to work 18 hours a day, 7 days a week and are paid far less than agreed in the contract, if they receive pay at all. They are forced to sleep on the floor, are underfed, and are forbidden to leave their employment facilities or compounds. They are kept in complete social isolation without outside social contacts or freedom of movement. They are subjected to frequent beatings and often face the trauma of sexual abuse by the male members of the household. It is virtually impossible for foreign workers to improve their situations, as they are deprived of legal recourse when their passports are confiscated by their employers upon entry to Saudi Arabia. Expatriates who complain or attempt to seek legal redress can be arrested and held indefinitely without charge, legal counsel, and access to their embassies. Consequently, foreigners are executed in much larger numbers than Saudi citizens. For instance, in 2003, fifty individuals were executed by the Saudi authorities; only 19 of them were Saudis. Minority rights Religious minorities in Saudi Arabia (non-Wahhabi Muslims and non-Muslims) face discrimination in employment and education, and are forbidden from openly practicing their religion. In cases involving the calculation of accidental injury or death compensation, a non-Muslim receives only half of the compensation that a male Muslim would receive, and in some cases only one- sixteenth of that amount, depending on intentionality. The testimony of non- Wahhabi Muslims can be disregarded, and non-Muslims are likely to receive harsher criminal sentences than Muslims. All verdicts are decided by the whim of partial Wahhabi judges. The 2004 statistical report from the Saudi Ministry of Economy and Planning acknowledged that non-Saudis account for 67% of the Kingdom's labor force. Other estimates set this figure as high as 85 to 90%. This translates to nearly seven million foreigners, or one-third of the population of Saudi Arabia, who live and work in the country without any rights or recognition under the strict Saudi-Wahhabi religious laws and practices. Without these workers, many of whom are non-Muslims, the Saudi economy would collapse. This hiring practice permeates the government and private employment sectors. Saudis are bypassed in favor of cheap labor, mostly from poorer Asian or African countries, who accept any terms without complaint due to their fear of arrest or deportation. Despite Saudi Arabia's dependence on its labor and expertise, foreign workers in the country are treated very poorly. Upon entry into the country, the passports of non- diplomats are confiscated by their employers or sponsors and the foreigner becomes a virtual hostage of his or her sponsor until departing the country. Foreign workers often face abusive conditions in the workplace, being denied breaks and meals while working unreasonably long hours, and in some cases not receiving pay for months or years at a time. There are reports of verbal and physical abuse, especially of foreign women working as domestic servants in Saudi households. There is no minimum wage, and workers do not have the right to organize or strike. There is no agency that recognizes the grievances of foreign laborers, and they may not access the justice system. Embassies of foreign workers often side with the Saudis for fear of losing Saudi loans, favorable trade deals, and access to cheap oil. CDHR strongly urges the international community to condemn these abuses and the institutional discrimination against anyone in Saudi Arabia because of belief, ethnicity, race, or gender. The recognition and protection of basic human rights constitutes a part of the democratization process. A policy of fairness and decency must replace the government-sanctioned practice of discrimination and abuse in Saudi Arabia.

She served during the Napoleonic Wars. Amphion was built by Betts, of Mistleythorn, and was launched on 19 March 1798. Career Amphions first mission was to Jamaica in 1798, but by 1799 she was off Southern Spain under Captain Bennett. That year she captured a Spanish letter of marque, Nuestra Senora del Corvodorvya (alias Asturiana), on 25 November 1799. Asturiana was armed with eighteen 8-pounder and two 12-pounder guns, and four 36-pounder howitzers. She and her crew of 180 men were sailing from Cadiz to La Vera Cruz with a valuable cargo. She had been part of a convoy of five vessels. Amphion shared with in the head-money that was finally paid in March 1829. Amphion remained in the Mediterranean until the Peace of Amiens. In 1802 Amphion was employed in attacking British smugglers in the English Channel and later conveyed the ambassador to Portugal to Lisbon. In 1803 Amphion was paid off but later recommissioned and transported Horatio Nelson to the Mediterranean to take command. She remained in the Mediterranean under Captain Samuel Sutton, and was part of the fleet blockading Toulon. Amphion was one of the ships selected to hunt and capture the Spanish treasure fleet destroyed at the Action of 5 October 1804. In October 1805 the captaincy was given to William Hoste at Lisbon, and he sailed to Gibraltar and subsequently Algiers before operating off Cadiz and Sicily. After the battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, Amphion was at the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship Nemesis, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. Amphion shared the prize money with ten other British warships. On the 28th July 1806 the 3rd battalion of the Polish-Italian Legion, 500 strong, surrendered to Captain Hoste in the Amphion and the 78th Foot at Crotone. Captain Hoste (1811) In May 1808, Hoste was ordered to attack the French frigate Baleine off Rosas. Amphion succeeded in destroying the vessel without severe loss and in November joined off Trieste in the Adriatic. There Hoste operated against French and Italian shipping for the next three years, sailing from Lissa and periodically refitting at Malta. In this time, Hoste managed to capture or destroy huge quantities of French supplies and provoked the attention of a French squadron under Bernard Dubourdieu. In March 1811, Dubourdieu attacked at the Battle of Lissa and was heavily defeated, Amphions fire killing Dubourdieu and wrecking his flagship. Two other ships were captured, but Hoste was wounded and the ship returned to Britain. In 1813 Amphion was attached to the North Sea fleet and late in the year her crew landed on Schouwen-Duiveland in the Netherlands and captured the island. In early 1814 Amphion continued to attack French shore positions along the North Sea coast but with the end of the war returned to Britain. In 1818 Amphion sailed to Brazil and in 1820 she was decommissioned.

Blumenschein House is a historic house museum and art gallery at 222 Ledoux Street in Taos, New Mexico. It was a home of painter Ernest L. Blumenschein (1874-1960), a co-founder of the Taos Society of Artists and one of the \\"Taos Six\\". It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and Description and history The Blumenschein House is located on the south side of Ledoux Street, 1-1/2 blocks south of central plaza in Taos. It is a single-story adobe structure, with eleven room, built in the Spanish Pueblo style with a central courtyard. A low wall with central opening separate the courtyard from the street. The house's construction date is uncertain, but its oldest sections probably predate the 1820s. The interior is furnished to appear as it might have been when the Blumenschein family lived there. It features family possessions, a collection of the family's art, works by other famous Taos artists, and fine European and Spanish Colonial style antiques. The museum is owned and operated by Taos Historic Museums. Ernest Blumenschein, a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was schooled in art in Cincinnati, New York City, and Paris. While in Paris he met Joseph Henry Sharp, who described a visit he made to Taos in 1883. Blumenschein and Bert Phillips traveled to Taos in 1898, where they established the Taos Art Colony. He used this house as a home and studio from 1919 until 1960. The house itself had previously been used as a home and studio by Herbert Dunton, and was already well known as a gathering point for artists. The colony formed by these people was broadly influential in exposing the art world to Taos and the desert southwest. The house remained in the Blumenschein family until 1962, when his heirs donated it to the organization that is now Taos Historic Museums. After a period as a multiunit residence, it was converted into a museum and gallery space. Gallery File:E.L. Blumenshein House Dining Room 2.jpgDining room in Blumenschein Home.

History Chrysler dealer Seida was incorporated in 1925, and began as the dealer for Spain of all the brands of Chrysler Corporation. As such, it became very well known, and in the 1930s its main showroom in Madrid, located in downtown main avenue, Gran V√≠a, and known as Sal√≥n Chrysler, was noted by its luxury, serving even as sporadic art gallery for some avant-garde exhibitions. By the same years, Seida opened a new rationalist repair shop and gas station building in Espronceda Street, by the renowned architect Jos√© de Azpiroz, that became a hall-mark of the modern architectural trends in Madrid. In April 1935 Seida sponsored the show in Madrid of an American hell driver named Miller on a Plymouth car. That same year, 1935, Seida began to assemble Chrysler's Dodge trucks in a new plant built in Zorroza, on the docks of Bilbao. Several hundreds of them were made both before and after the Spanish Civil War. The links with Chrysler Corporation persisted until 1969, when Chrysler Europe disembarked in Spain through the acquisition of Barreiros. Banco de Bilbao in a bus body built by Seida in 1961 over a Pegaso 5040 chassis Coachbuilder In the 1940s, after the Spanish Civil War, Seida extended the premises in Zorroza with a new building to a Chrysler design, and switched to coachbuilding, the first bus chassis bodied being a hundred of German Kl√∂ckner units released in 1942. In those years Seida expanded its business to become shipowner, purchasing the merchant steamer Sendeja. By the 1950s Seida led the Spanish market of coach bodies, having patented, as Metalbloc, an all-metal body structure. By then Seida became the preferred bodybuilder for Pegaso, which was at the time the most pervasive bus and coach chassis maker in Spain. Specially memorable were its bodies for the Pegaso Z-404 coach or city bus chassis, that used to receive a striking body which featured the same cross-shaped radiator grille that Touring put in its carrozzerie for the Pegaso Z-102 sports cars. Along those years other significant Seida works were the bodies for Hispano-Suiza trolleybuses for the city of San Sebasti√°n, Dodge two-level coaches for Iberia airline, double-deck Guy and single-deck Pegaso buses, for the city of Madrid, and ACLO and Pegaso inter-city line coaches for Alsa. For the city of Madrid too, Seida made its most impressive bodies: four three-axle V√©tra VA3B2 trolleybuses with GEE (General El√©ctrica Espa√±ola) electrical equipment.  Rootes and Babcock dealer  For a few years along the 50s, Seida was also dealer in Spain for the British Rootes Group car brands, and too for the short-lived Spanish-made Babcock truck. The K√§ssbohrer connection In 1963 Seida reached an agreement with German K√§ssbohrer to license-build Setra chassisless coaches. These were equipped with Pegaso engines and other mechanical units and were marketed with simultaneous double badge as Setra Seida and Pegaso. Initially Seida built models S14 and S10 from Setra, the first one, a full-length 12-meter 55 seat vehicle, being with a great difference the most demanded. A few years later the S154, recently launched by Setra, replaced the S14 while the S10 was discontinued. Despite being rather expensive, these coaches were very successful in the Spanish market, to the point that Seida opened a second plant in Vigo. In the 1970s MAN, Mercedes- Benz or Cummins engines were offered as alternative power units to the Pegaso ones, and the Setra Seida and Pegaso badging was replaced by just Setra. In 1981 Seida inaugurated a new modern plant in S√°mano (Castro Urdiales), but soon ran into difficulties, including bitter disagreements with K√§ssbohrer, and suffered in the late 80s and early 90s a long and rather complex financial and legal process, which included several changes of the society registered name and ownership. The plant in Vigo meanwhile was sold to Talleres Varela Bus, a general auto repair shop. The end In 1998 the Castro Urdiales plant went to the hands of Daimler-Benz's Evobus concern and Seida successor company disappeared.

Reid wrote many books and essays on the history of British Columbia, but his special interest was the study of the works of Rudyard Kipling. Another special field of interest was that coins of early British Columbia, concerning which he remains one of the main authorities. Biography Reid was born in Cornwallis Township, Kings County, Nova Scotia, in the community of Steam Mill Village on November 3, 1866 but ventured to British Columbia in 1885 to Victoria, British Columbia in 1885 to write the provincial teacher's examination. During this experience he met Frederic W. Howay, with whom he established a personal and professional relationship that lasted sixty years. Reid persuaded Howay to return to Nova Scotia with him to register for Law at Dalhousie University, from which they graduated together in 1890 and in 1893 formed the lawfirm Howay & Reid. Reid was appointed debenture commissioner for New Westminster after that city's Great Fire in 1898. In 1907 Reid joined William J. Bowser, then Attorney- General of British Columbia and later Premier, and D.S. Wallbridge to form Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge. From 1927 to 1943 Reid was a Bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia. Reid was also a member of the UBC board of governors from 1913 to 1935, and President of the British Columbia Historical Association in 1937, and is credited with the founding of the British Columbia Historical Quarterly. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1936, and was also a Member of the American Historical Association, Washington. Dr. Reid's interests in literature and the arts are also well documented. He was the first President of the Vancouver Little Theatre Association, and a member and chairman of the Board of the Vancouver Public Library. He died on February 6, 1945 of failing health. Legacy *Mount Robie Reid to the north of the Maple Ridge and Mission, British Columbia, near the Golden Ears, was named in commemoration of Reid, Mount Judge Howay just to the northeast was named for his colleague F.W. Howay. *The Howay-Reid Collection at the University of British Columbia was founded by Reid's donation of his personal book collection of 9,000 books, over 4,000 pamphlets, and a collection of assorted other media, including maps, photographs, correspondences, plus 50,000 file cards naming books he had been searching for. At the time of its creation this was the largest collection of Canadiana anywhere in the country.

Plot  The film begins with a man named Conrad von Starke (Adriano Micantoni) the Commandant driving down a road, listening to a war crimes trial on the radio. He stops the car and exits at the ruins of an old death camp. There he meets Lise Cohen (Daniela Poggi). It is revealed that Lise is a former prisoner of the camp and the commandant has arranged to meet her several years after World War II, to thank her for testimony she provided which saved him from certain death and helped him integrate into the new West Germany. After touring the camp, now run down, Lise and the Commandant make love. Lise has a flashback to the time she spent at the camp during the war. A shipment of female prisoners arrives. Some are immediately sent to the gas chamber and some are burned alive. In a hall, other women are stripped naked and subjected to an orgy by members of the SS- Totenkopfverb√§nde, aroused after watching a porn film which includes photos of rape, mother-daughter incest, bondage, coprophagia, urination and extreme sex. The female inmates are then raped, tortured, sodomized with bats, and sexually humiliated while the Commandant and a visiting SS General watch. Later, a woman has sex with an SS guard, who is himself shot when he speaks out against her rape by other guards. An inmate having her menstrual cycle is ordered to be thrown to the dogs by Alma (Maristella Greco), a female SS guard and the commandant's lover. More sex scenes between guards and inmates take place. Meanwhile, Starke and his SS staff debate Nazi theories at the dinner table, and an SS Guard tells them of his hopes that there will one day be farms so the Jews can be eaten as a food source. The staff become aroused by this and practice both cannibalism and infanticide, eating a stew made of unborn Jewish infants. When one of the female prisoners passes out in shock, they douse her body in brandy and set it alight, before eating her corpse as well. Starke becomes interested in Lise, finding himself obsessed by her unbreakable spirit. Since whatever he does to torture her does not demoralize her, Starke grows angry and drops her only friend at the camp into a pit of quicklime as Lise, stripped nude and hanging from her wrists, is forced to watch. The Commandant threatens to drop Lise into the pit as well. Unfazed by this, Lise is whipped, has her head lowered into a box filled with rats (clearly gerbils in the film), and raped, but still she does not cry out. She goes to the hospital and is treated by a pacifistic young Doctor (Fulvio Ricciardi), revealing to him why she does not cry. She wants to die, as she betrayed her family to the Nazis years earlier and feels intense guilt about it. When the Doctor tells her it was not her fault, she becomes determined to survive. She has sex with the Doctor, reaffirming her decision to live. Lise is tortured further by Starke, who tells her he has fallen in love with her. She claims to love him as well, and begins an extreme sexual relationship with him, willingly donning a gruesome belt made of the scalps of fellow inmates to prove her affections. The Commandant is later sodomized with his own whip by jealous Alma, who realizes the extent of Starke's feelings for Lise. In response, he fatally strangles Alma. Lise gives birth to a child, but the baby is killed by the Commandant because it is \\"half-Jewish\\", and a \\"half-breed\\" would have no place in the world. Back in the present day, Lise and Starke still stand in the ruined camp and are having sex. Lise shoots him and his body falls into a pit. In alternate edits of the film, Lise shoots Starke and then herself. Style Gestapo's Last Orgy was part of a sub-genre of exploitation films created in the early 1970s called Naziploitation. These films were primarily produced in the United States and Italy. Release Gestapo's Last Orgy passed Italian censors on January 28, 1977. It has been released under several English titles on home video including Gestapo's Last Orgy and Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler.

Mubarak () is an Arabic given name. A variant form is Baraka or Barack (), analogous to the Hebrew word \\"berech\\" , meaning \\"knee\\", and derived from common Semitic roots for the concept of kneeling in praise/to receive a blessing. Mubarak is thus the Arabic equivalent in meaning of the Latinate word \\"Benedict\\" (from Benedictus \\"blessed\\" or, literally, \\"well-spoken\\"). Etymologically, the name is from the consonantal root B-R-K, meaning \\"knee\\", and verbally \\"to prostrate oneself\\", and hence \\"to receive blessing\\". The feminine noun barakah () means \\"blessing\\". In Islam, and specifically within the Sufi tradition, it has a meaning similar to \\"charisma\\". The Hebrew cognate is berakhah. The Biblical name Baruch is the Hebrew cognate; see Book of Baruch for an instance of the name. The name is sometimes written differently in different countries; for example, the last name of singer Shakira (a Lebanese-Colombian) is Mebarak. When an Arabic name is used in other languages, the patronymic is often rendered as a last name. In other contexts, Mubarak is a proper last name (e.g., cricket player Jehan Mubarak).

Plot The film focuses on Minerva Mirabal and tells the true story of how she and her sisters came to represent the greatest threat to dictator Rafael Trujillo and his regime. The Mirabal sisters were involved in an underground movement against the government. They were assassinated in 1960 by men under the instruction of the Trujillo regime according to Pupo Roman, although their death was made to appear as an automobile accident. Many citizens were outraged and a few months later Trujillo was assassinated by an ambush led by Antonio de La Maza, who was played by actor Cesar Evora. Antonio de la Maza was killed in turn by a death squad led by Ramfis Trujillo.

The surviving sister, Ded√© Mirabal, consulted on and participated in the production of the film; she was portrayed by actress Celin√©s Toribio. Controversy In July 2008, the president of the Minerva Mirabal Foundation, Carlos Leiter, publicly criticized the film, specifically the involvement of actress Michelle Rodriguez due to her past legal issues. Leiter threatened to sue Rodriguez and her co-producers citing illegal use of the Mirabal name, unless charitable organizations of his choice, including his own, were given all revenues, including Rodriguez's entire personal salary, from the film. Within days, the film's writer/director Juan Delancer responded to such criticisms by stating \\"One does not need permission to bring history to film.\\" Delancer pointed out that Ded√© Mirabal and the Mirabal family themselves approved of and supported the film and Rodriguez, with Ded√© even appearing in the film as its narrator. Delancer also defended Rodriguez, as both a person and actress, saying it is impressive that \\"a figure of her stature who had just completed projects with the likes of Charlize Theron (in Battle in Seattle) and James Cameron (in Avatar)\\" would even participate in such a small production, let alone show such \\"undeniable\\" dedication to it as both an actress and producer.

Early life Born in Arad, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire (modern-day Romania), in 1854 as Franz Denta, son of an army NCO, he became a lieutenant in the 3 Galizisches Uhlanen-Regiment Erzherzog Carl in 1876 upon graduating from the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener-Neustadt. He later attended the Austrian War College. Having attained the rank of Colonel, he was appointed Chief of Staff of II Corps in September 1897, a position in which he served until April 1901. By 1903 Denta was commanding the 73 Landwehr-Brigade at Pressburg/Pozsony (modern-day Bratislava) and in 1909 was made General Inspector of military educational establishments. In 1911 he was promoted to the rank of General der Kavallerie and appointed commander of the Hungarian Landwehr (Honved) in 1913. War service Responsible for the task of defending the southwestern frontier and historic heartlands of the Empire following the Italian declaration of war on May 23, 1915, Rohr was appointed commander of Armeegruppe Rohr on May 27 and took charge of all troops from Graz to Innsbruck. Having overseen the successful defense of the Carinthian frontier, Rohr was promoted to the rank of Generaloberst on January 1, 1916, and made commander of the new 10th Army following the dissolution of his army-group in anticipation of the Tyrol Offensive. With the halting of all offensive operations on the Italian front by the Imperial army in the face of the Brusilov Offensive, the Tyrol effort was prematurely brought to an end and Rohr was transferred to command the 11th Army, also in the Trento district in June 1916. In February 1917, and with the promotion of Gen. Arz von Straussenberg to the position of Chief of the General Staff, Rohr took charge of the 1st Army and for the first time served as a commander on the Eastern Front. On April 14, 1917, he was elevated to the nobility, taking the rank of Baron and the title Rohr von Denta. Promoted to the position of Field Marshal on January 30, 1918, Rohr continued in command of the 1st Army until its disbandment following peace with Romania on April 15, 1918. Retirement Retiring from command at war‚Äôs end, Rohr was nevertheless appointed Field Marshal in the army of newly independent Hungary. Freiherr Rohr von Denta died in the village of Rodaun, near Vienna, on 9 December 1927.

It is used as a facility of the US Navy for transmitting orders to submerged submarines near Aguada, Puerto Rico at by using radio waves in the very low frequency range. The Aguada transmission station, originally part of \\"The Naval Radio Transmitter Facility Aguada\\", works on very low frequency (VLF) 40.75 kHz with the callsign NAU. The Naval Radio Transmitter Facility Aguada, apparently consisted of three locations with guyed towers: the primary Aguada transmission station in a 330-acre site; the Naval Radio Receiver at a 242-acre site in Salinas County; and the Naval Radio Transmitter at a 408-acre site in Isabela County. Only the tallest with a height of 367.3 metres (1205 ft) is still standing and in use., while the other two were dismantled. It is the tallest structure in Puerto Rico and in the Caribbean region.  Communication with submarines  This transmission station emits signals below 50 kHz, being capable of penetrating ocean depths to approximately 200 metres. The United States Navy communicates with submarines on these frequencies. Due to the low frequency, a VLF broadcast antenna needs to be quite large. In fact, broadcasting sites are usually a few square kilometres. This prevents such antennas being installed on submarines. Submarines carry only a VLF reception aerial and do not respond on such low frequencies, so a ground-to- submarine VLF broadcast is always a one-way broadcast, originating on the ground and received aboard the boat. If two-way communication is needed, the boat must ascend to periscope depth (just below the surface) and raise a telescopic mast antenna to communicate on higher frequencies (such as HF, UHF, or VHF). Because of the narrow bandwidth of this band, VLF radio signals cannot carry audio (voice), and can transmit text messages only at a slow data rate. VLF data transmission rates are around 300 bit/s - or about 35 eight-bit ASCII characters per second (or the equivalent of a sentence every two seconds) - a total of 450 words per minute. Simply shifting to 7 bit ASCII increases the number of transmitted characters per time unit by 14%. An additional shift to a 6 bit or a 5 bit code (such as the baudot code) would result in speeds of more than 600 and 700 words per minute. In situations where GPS is denied to U.S. forces, VLF may be used to help provide position navigation and timing. The VLF stations, such as this in Puerto Rico, are in fixed locations. As part of a backup system, the VLF signals may be used to triangulate a user's position on the globe, in much the same way a GPS receiver is used.

He also made eleven appearances for Scotland. Nibloe was a full back who could play on either flank, initially starting his career as a left back then switching to the right later in his career. He is one of a select group of players who won national cup winner's medals in both England and Scotland; he played in three cup finals in the space of six years.allfootballers.com. Gives career statistics. Playing career Early days Nibloe was born in the small hamlet of Corkerhill, just to the south- west of Glasgow, on 23 November 1903. He was a late developer as a footballer, playing as a part-time amateur until the age of 20. In his youth he played for Glencairn Green, Shawfield Juniors and Rutherglen Glencairn while working at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan as a brass moulder. Initially he was a centre forward, once scoring five goals in a game for Shawfield, but his career took off when he converted into a left back and was offered a professional contract by Kilmarnock in June 1924. Kilmarnock Nibloe seldom featured in his first season at Kilmarnock but became a regular in his second after the departure of David Gibson. In his eight years at Rugby Park he made 279 appearances for Killie in the two major competitions,(Kilmarnock player) Nibloe, Joe, FitbaStats helping them win the Scottish Cup on 6 April 1929, defeating Rangers 2‚Äì0 in the final.Scottish Cup Surprise Kilmarnock's Great Victory Over Rangers, The Glasgow Herald, 8 April 1929 Kilmarnock reached the Scottish Cup final again in 1932 but this time Nibloe had to settle for a runners-up medal as they lost to Rangers after a replay.Rangers Win The Cup Kilmarnock Well Beaten, The Glasgow Herald, 21 April 1932 Soon after this he signed for Aston Villa for the 1932‚Äì33 season for a fee of ¬£1800 after a disagreement with Kilmarnock over a benefit match.Kilmarnock in History: Nibloe's tough exit, Kilmarnock FC, 9 July 2020 His run of 132 consecutive league appearances between October 1925 and February 1929 (ending only because he was travelling as a reserve with the Scottish national team)Kilmarnock in History: Four games, three countries, five days, Kilmarnock FC, 22 June 2020 is still a club record.www.napit.co.uk. States that Nibloe is the most capped Kilmarnock player. Aston Villa Nibloe struggled to find a regular place in the Villa team in that first season as the team finished runners up to Arsenal in Division One being kept out of the side by the near veteran Tommy Mort. However the following season (1933‚Äì34) Nibloe dislodged Mort from the team and displayed excellent form, and it caused something of an uproar when he signed for Sheffield Wednesday in the summer of 1934 in a part- exchange deal which saw George Beeson going to Villa Park along with ¬£2,500. Sheffield Wednesday Wednesday's signing of the experienced 30-year-old Nibloe was seen as something of a coup by the club, no doubt the influence of manager Billy Walker made a difference as Walker had been a teammate of Nibloe's at Villa the previous season. Competition for the left back spot was keen even though Wednesday had lost Ernie Blenkinsop to Liverpool the previous season; Ted Catlin had stepped into Blenkinsop's boots and Nibloe was forced to switch to right back to secure a place in the team. He made his Wednesday debut in the opening fixture of the 1934‚Äì35 season on 25 August 1934, in a 4‚Äì1 home victory over Stoke City.\\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\\", Tony Matthews, Page 179 Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career. Nibloe played in five out the six FA Cup ties in 1935 as Wednesday won the trophy, missing just the 3rd round home tie against Oldham Athletic in January. Nibloe made his final appearance for Wednesday in the final game of the 1937‚Äì38, in his final two seasons he was more of a squad player as his place was challenged by Jack Ashley. He retired from playing competitive football at the outbreak of World War II at the age of 35.Sheffield Wednesday Archive. Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career. International Shortly after winning the Scottish Cup in 1929, Nibloe was called up for the first of his eleven appearances for Scotland on 13 April 1929, featuring in a 1‚Äì0 victory over England at Hampden Park. All his Scottish caps came while he was with Kilmarnock and he is still today the club's most capped player, his last appearance for his country came in May 1932 against France. He also played twice for the Scottish League representative side in his time at Rugby Park. After football Nibloe worked in a munitions factory in Stocksbridge during the war. After the conflict he continued to live in Stocksbridge and work in the Samuel Fox steelworks. He died on 25 October 1976 in Doncaster, aged 72. His son Jack Nibloe also played professional football for Sheffield United, Stoke City, Doncaster Rovers and Stockport County between 1958 and 1964; he was killed in a road accident on the Woodhead Pass in November 1964.\\"The Wednesday Boys\\", Jason Dickinson & John Brodie, Page 217 Gives biographical information.

In the first story, two beautiful young lovers are unable to consummate their passion because the young man desires impossible perfection. In the second story, the director follows a woman who reveals that she murdered her father. In the third story, a man makes an effort to appease both his wife and his mistress. In the fourth story, a young man is romantically infatuated with a woman who is soon to enter a convent. This was the final feature-length film by Antonioni before his death in 2007. Plot The director (John Malkovich) is flying to Italy following the conclusion of his latest film. On the airplane, as he looks out beyond the clouds, he begins to think about his next film and the art of filmmaking.

As they walk past the Castello Estense, she speaks of words that need to be spoken, but he says the only words worth speaking are hidden inside. Silvano walks Carmen to her home, where she reveals that she lived with a man for a year, and only recently he left her. \\"Words do us good,\\" she tells Silvano, \\"even in writing.

On the train the director considers the \\"limits of our brains, of our experience, of our culture, of our inspiration, of our imagination, of our sensitivity.\\" A woman enters his compartment, gets a phone call, and says, \\"Don't call me again.\\" Meanwhile, on a nearby hill, an artist (Marcello Mastroianni) is painting the very landscape the train is passing through. He explains to a woman the value of copying from the masters. ;This Body of Filth In Aix-en-Provence, the director is contemplating the paintings in his hotel lobby when he notices a man entering the building across the street to deliver architectural drawings. When he reemerges, the man, Niccolo (Vincent Perez), passes a young woman (Ir√®ne Jacob) in the doorway and decides to follow her. He asks if he can accompany her, and she tells him she's going to church. Niccolo is surprised that this quiet woman has little to say and seems uninterested in the world around her. She tells him that to be happy we need to eliminated pointless thoughts‚Äîthat she prefers the quiet. As they walk along the cobblestone streets, the young woman tells Niccolo that she longs to escape her body, that it needs too much and is never satisfied. Niccolo seems more interested in her body. When she does not respond to his romantic approaches, he observes that she looks like someone who is in love, like someone who is satisfied. She acknowledges that she is. When they arrive at the Church of Saint-Jean-de- Malte, the young woman enters the church, and he follows her inside. During the service, the young woman appears deeply spiritual as the choir sings. Detached and bored, Niccolo walks around like a tourist gazing up at the architecture before sitting down away from the congregation. Later Niccolo wakes up in the now empty church following the service. He runs out into the dark streets looking for the young woman, finding her at a well. They talk about the impermanence of things. He admits that he is scared of death, and she tells him she is scared of life‚Äîthe life people lead. Niccolo accompanies the young woman home, stopping in an entranceway to escape the rain. Asked what would happen if he fell in love with her, she responds, \\"You'd be lighting a candle in a room full of light.\\" When they reach her apartment, he asks to see her the next day. She replies simply, \\"Tomorrow I enter a convent.\\" Niccolo walks out into the night and the rain. Cast Production Screenplay The screenplay was adapted from four sketches titled \\"Story of a Love Affair that Never Existed\\", \\"The Girl, The Crime ...\\", \\"Don't Try to Find Me\\", and \\"This Body of Filth\\", from Antonioni's book, That Bowling Alley on the Tiber. Antonioni, who was 83 at the time of the film's production, had a stroke that left him severely incapacitated. The film was completed with help from Wim Wenders, who wrote its prologue and epilogue and worked on the screenplay. Filming locations Beyond the Clouds was filmed in the following locations: * Ferrara, Italy * Aix-en-Provence, Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne, France * Portofino, Genoa, Liguria, Italy * Paris, France Reception Critical response Beyond the Clouds received mixed to positive reviews with the general consensus being that fans of Antonioni's work would welcome and appreciate this as one of the director's last films; others would be less embracing of his distinctive cinematic style. In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote, \\"There are moments of such astounding visual power in Michelangelo Antonioni's film Beyond the Clouds that you are all but transported through the screen to a place where the physical and emotional weather fuse into a palpable sadness. ... More than just a great director's autumnal musings, Beyond the Clouds is a long goodbye to an idea of cinema as a high art, one that can flourish only as long as there are directors of Mr. Antonioni's vision to dream it into being.\\" In his review in the San Francisco Chronicle, Edward Guthmann gave the film a qualified positive review, writing, \\"For Antonioni lovers, who don't mind the moody silences and labyrinths of an Antonioni film and will recognize the echoes of earlier films, Beyond the Clouds won't be disappointing. A less partial audience, I'd guess, will find it slow, labored and self-conscious.\\" Guthman sees as the dominant theme of the film \\"the ways in which desire distorts perception and leaves us betrayed when our wishes and reality prove incompatible. ... It's that compelling sense of mystery, of the endless search and its undercurrent of loneliness, that sets this great filmmaker apart.\\" In his review in the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \\"There are a lot of beautiful things in Beyond the Clouds: the style, the settings, the bodies of young men and women-many of them beautiful in the vaguely blank way that models are.\\" On the aggregate reviewer web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 65% positive rating from top film critics based on 20 reviews, and a 68% positive audience rating based on 3,618 reviews. Box office The film earned $3,252,000 in gross revenue in Italy, and $31,738 in the United States. As of February 1996, the film had 230,924 admissions in France, and as of August 1996, the film had 24,951 admissions in Portugal.

Such auctions include the sale of high quality antique paintings, furniture, objets d'art, tapestries, books, and other household items. History Country house contents auctions have been held formally since at least the mid 18th century, when dedicated auction houses were founded. The main auctioneers coordinating these sales today are Sotheby's, Christie's and Bonhams, with other auctions conducted by Lawrence's. A high quality auction catalogue is also published, giving details and photographs of the lots, including provenance, technical descriptions and estimated sale price ranges. These catalogues can also become collectables in their own right. The largest on-site contents auction to date, by proceeds value, is Viscount Leverhulme's Thornton Manor in the Wirral, raising over ¬£9.5 million in 2001. However, in present-day values, the largest is still probably the Earl of Rosebery's Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, which generated over ¬£6 million in 1977. The Wentworth Woodhouse ¬£15 million auction in 1998 is excluded because the items had not been in situ in the house prior to the auction, and they were not auctioned at the house, but rather in Christie‚Äôs London auction rooms. However, all these figures are occasionally eclipsed by the one-off sale of a special painting or drawing (not listed here), such as the private sale of Castle Howard's Sir Joshua Reynolds \\"Portrait of Omai\\" to the Tate Britain for ¬£12.5 million in March 2003, and Alnwick Castle's sale of Raphael's \\"Madonna of the Pinks\\" to the National Gallery, London for ¬£35 million in 2004. Additionally, there can be the sale of paintings no longer in situ, but on loan to galleries, such as the 7th Duke of Sutherland of Mertoun House who sold Titian‚Äôs Diana and Actaeon for ¬£50m in 2008 and Diana and Callisto for ¬£45m in 2012 to the British and Scottish National Galleries, both originally hanging in Bridgewater House from 1854 until 1939.

From 1943 until her death, it was the principal residence and studio of artist Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986). It is now part of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, which has sites in Santa Fe and Abiqui√∫. Public tours are available March‚ÄìNovember, with advance tickets required. The Home and Studio became a National Historic Landmark in 1998, as one of the most important artistic sites in the southwestern United States. This article incorporates public domain text from this US government website. Description and history The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio is located in the small unincorporated village of Abiqui√∫, near the St. Thomas Church. The building is a single-story adobe structure, largely built in the traditional style. It has thick adobe walls, and a flat roof supported by a network of vigas and latillas (smaller wooden elements crossing the larger viga beams). The house is organized in wings a single room deep, which surround a central patio/plaza. The house has a number of modernist elements, including skylights and large picture windows that provide expansive views of the surrounding landscape and brought natural light into areas that such houses traditionally did not have. O'Keeffe was insistent on these types of deviations from the traditional form, stating in an interview that \\"I didn't want a Spanish house; I didn't want an Indian house, [or] a Mexican house; I wanted my house!\\" With Portions of the house are believed to date to the 1730s, and it was in deteriorating condition when Georgia O'Keeffe first spotted it in the 1930s. At the time, it was owned by the Roman Catholic church, which did not want to sell it. It eventually relented, and O'Keeffe was able to purchase it in 1943. She undertook to rehabilitate and modernize the property, work that was a collaborative effort with her friend Maria Chabot. This work was completed in 1946, at which time O'Keeffe made it her permanent home. Included in the compound is a smaller outbuilding which was her principal studio space. The house remained O'Keeffe's primary residence until 1984, when she moved to Santa Fe two years prior to her death at age 98. In 1989, the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation became owner and manager of the Abiqui√∫ property. It is now owned and managed by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998. Georgia O'Keeffe Home, sitting room, looking into garden. 1996 photo.

It spans in a south to north direction. It is known locally as Causeway Boulevard. Route description From the south, LA 3046 begins in Jefferson at an interchange with U.S. 90 (Jefferson Highway). It heads north and immediately becomes elevated to cross several railroad tracks and LA 3139 (Earhart Expressway). LA 3046 ends at a multi-level traffic circle interchange with U.S. 61 (Airline Drive) in Metairie. Causeway Boulevard continues northward through Metairie to I-10 (Exit 228) and ultimately the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. LA 3046 is a divided, four-lane highway for its entire length. History LA 3046 began as part of the Greater New Orleans Expressway, a 1950s project to transform the century-old Harlem Avenue right- of-way into a multilane highway connecting U.S. 90 (Jefferson Highway), U.S. 61 (Airline Highway, now Drive), and Veterans Memorial Highway (now Boulevard) to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway then under construction. Harlem Avenue would be renamed Causeway Boulevard. The expressway's name survives in the Greater New Orleans Expressway Commission which maintains and patrols the Causeway bridge. The multilevel rotary interchange at U.S. 61 (Airline Highway) and the hook ramp at U.S. 90 (Jefferson Highway) were opened in June 1957. The narrow hook ramp originally carried two-way traffic (southbound Causeway Boulevard to eastbound Jefferson Highway and eastbound Jefferson Highway to northbound Causeway Boulevard). It was reconfigured in 1999 to carry one-way traffic, with southbound Causeway Boulevard traffic now crossing the Jefferson Highway median to turn eastbound. The ramp's clearance over Jefferson Highway was increased from to in 2009 to facilitate truck traffic passing underneath. Acceleration and deceleration lanes were added to the north side of the rotary interchange in 2003, while the south side remains in its original configuration. Major intersections Louisiana Highway 3046 Spur Louisiana Highway 3046 Spur (LA 3046 Spur) was a state highway in Louisiana that served Jefferson Parish. It spanned in a west to east direction along Lausat Street. The western terminus of LA 3046 Spur was at LA 3046 (Causeway Boulevard) between LA 3139 (Earhart Expressway) and U.S. 61 (Airline Drive). There was no connection between the spur route and its parent as the two highways did not meet at grade: LA 3046 (Causeway Boulevard) is elevated via a long overpass, and LA 3046 Spur existed at ground level on Lausat Street. LA 3046 Spur headed east to a terminus at LA 3262 (Labarre Road). The route was deleted in 2010. LA 3046 Spur was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.

He was the last secretary of the Christian Democracy party and the first secretary of the Italian People's Party founded in 1994. Biography Martinazzoli studied at Collegio Borromeo in Pavia, where he received a law degree. He then became a lawyer. In the years 1960‚Äì1970s he assumed official roles in Brescia's DC, and became president of the province (1970‚Äì1972). He was also elected in the Italian Senate, after which he became Minister of Justice in 1983, a position he held for three years. In 1986‚Äì1989 he was president of DC's deputies. In 1989‚Äì1990 he was Minister of Defence, but resigned (together with other ministers of DC's left wing) after the approval of a law which strengthened Silvio Berlusconi's monopoly over private TV channels in Italy. In 1992, when Democrazia Cristiana was being wiped out by the Tangentopoli bribery scandal, Martinazzoli, generally respected as an honest and competent man, was elected national secretary. Despite his efforts, the political crisis which followed the corruption scandals forced him to dissolve DC in 1994. Martinazzoli then founded a new party, based on similar ideals, known as People's Party\\" (1994‚Äì2002) (Partito Popolare Italiano, or PPI), whose name recalled that of the ancestor of DC, which was founded in the early 20th century by Luigi Sturzo. In the new majoritarian system, Martinazzoli's party placed itself in the center, between the left (which included the heirs of the Italian Communist Party) and the new Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which had allied with the northern regionalist party, Northern League, and the post- fascist National Alliance. His will not to ally with any of them caused numerous politicians (such as Pierferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella) to leave PPI and form the Christian Democratic Centre, which supported Berlusconi. At the 1994 elections, Martinazzoli formed a center alliance known as Pact for Italy, including PPI and other democratic centre forces. However, the result of the election was disappointing, with PPI obtaining 11%, some one third of DC's consensus before its dissolution. In the same year, he accepted to run as mayor of Brescia for the new centre-left coalition, The Olive Tree, winning the final ballot and acting as mayor until 1998. In 2000 he lost the competition with Roberto Formigoni for the presidency of Lombardy. After PPI was dissolved in 2002, Martinazzoli migrated to Mastella's UDEUR (2004), being appointed as its president. He resigned in 2005.

Marks Scout Resource Center Cradle of Liberty Council, Inc., Boy Scouts of America, v. City of Philadelphia also known as Cradle of Liberty Council v. City of Philadelphia, [2:08-cv-02429RB] is a U.S. Court case involving the Cradle of Liberty Council versus the City of Philadelphia. The case was filed on May 23, 2008, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter presided over the case. The Boy Scouts were represented by Drinker Biddle & Reath. The case ended with the court ruling in favor of the Boy Scouts of America. The Cradle of Liberty Council Council is also entitled to collect $877,000 of legal costs from the city's unlawful action. Background The City of Philadelphia said that it cannot allow organizations that receive city benefits to discriminate and planned to evict the local Scout council from their city-owned service center building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Similar city owned land was used by other organizations such as churches which have a religious test for the participants. The Historic Landmark building laden with Scouting symbols was built and paid for by the Scouts on city land at the city's request in 1929 and the cost of maintenance and renovation has been borne by the Boy Scout council ever since. The Council claimed: The Boy Scouts of America is a private, non-profit organization engaged in instilling its system of values in young people. It asserts that open homosexuality by leaders is inconsistent with those values. The Scouts contend that the city's ultimatum violates their rights under the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions, namely, the right to Freedom of Assembly guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 2003, the City of Philadelphia, under the leadership of Mayor John F. Street, indicated that council's policies violated the city's 1982 Fair Practices law. This effort to have the Scouts change their policy or be evicted was led by R. Duane Perry, an Eagle Scout and gay rights activist. The Boy Scouts of America maintain an official policy of barring \\"avowed homosexuals\\" from leadership; Cradle of Liberty, however, had adopted a non- discrimination policy. The BSA National Office sent Cradle of Liberty a cease- and-desist letter which threatened dissolution of the council if it failed to adopt the policies set forth by the National office, and the council rescinded its non-discrimination policy at the annual BSA meeting. Philadelphia, whose city charter bylaws prohibit discrimination against all individuals, including anti-gay discrimination, owns the land on which the council headquarters building stands and rents it to the council for $1 annually. Similar deals are given to other non-profits, including churches that have religious tests for their leadership. Because of the council's decision to follow national policy, the city wanted the council to vacate the office at 23rd and Winter Streets (near the Franklin Institute); this decision drew fire from Scouting officials and city residents who saw Scouting as an alternative to the \\"mean streets\\" of the depressed areas of the city. In 2004, negotiations with the city resulted with the Scouts promising not to \\"unlawfully discriminate.\\" This agreement held until the city realized that under the Supreme Court decision (Boy Scouts of America v. Dale) the Scouts could lawfully exclude people from membership. Afterward, the city reversed its decision. In July 2006, Mayor Street again told the council to either change its policy, pay fair market rent or leave the city-owned Marks Scout Resource Center. The city said that providing the city-owned property rent-free to the council violates Philadelphia's anti- discrimination laws. The BSA fought the city's decision. > Local Boy Scouts officials must vacate their Center City headquarters by > July 24, 2007, if they don‚Äôt begin either paying rent or accepting gays, > City Solicitor Romulo L. Diaz Jr. said this week. The commission issued its > notice to the Scouts on July 24, 2006, stating they could avoid eviction if > they began paying fair-market rent or accepting gays, Diaz said. \\"Our > position is that [the Scouts] already have been given notice,\\" Diaz told > Philadelphia Gay News. \\"The clock began ticking on July 24, 2006, at the > latest.\\" The mayor and City Council also must approve the eviction, but the > 1928 ordinance doesn‚Äôt specify a time frame for those approvals, Diaz added. However, citing \\"rising violence and other urban ills daily threatening Philadelphia's teens,\\" some community leaders said it made no sense to evict the Boy Scouts. Also, some questioned the objectivity of city solicitor Romulo L. Diaz, Jr., himself openly gay, in moving to evict the Scouts but not worrying about similar deals with churches who restrict attendance to members. \\\\- arguing that the city could lose $62 million in federal funds with the eviction because of the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 and the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act. Around May 31, 2007, the Philadelphia City Council voted 16-1 on a bill introduced by Darrell L. Clarke to permit the eviction and terminate the 1928 lease by which the council was allowed the use of the building \\"in perpetuity.\\" This came despite the fact that the building itself was built and paid for by the Scouts, and given to the city with the understanding that the Scouts would be allowed to remain in it \\"in perpetuity.\\" Because of this decision, the council would have had to pay $200,000 rent or leave the building. This would have left Philadelphia to become the largest city in the nation without its own council office. Street's successor, Mayor Michael Nutter said in a televised debate on NBC 10 Live @ Issue, \\"In my administration, we will not subsidize discrimination.\\" Solicitor Diaz gave the Council until December 3, 2007 to comply with the city's demand. The Scouts indicated they would file suit, and did so in May 2008. The scouts claimed their civil rights were being violated, and the firm Drinker Biddle took the case pro bono. On September 26, 2008, the US District Court said that the Council's claim that the city's actions were designed to impinge BSA's First Amendment rights had merit and that BSA's suit could proceed. On November 20, 2009, the US District Court ordered the city to \\"immediately cease and desist\\" efforts in Common Pleas Court to evict the council from its headquarters while a federal lawsuit was pending. The ruling by Judge Buckwalter did not prevent the city from pursuing similar claims in the federal suit. Outcome On June 15, 2010, the case went to trial in Federal Court and 8 days later, on June 23, 2010, a Federal Jury of eight unanimously sided with the Cradle of Liberty Council and against the city's unlawful selective eviction of the Boy Scouts. Under federal Civil Rights Law, the Cradle of Liberty Council Council is also entitled to collect its $877,000 of legal costs from the city's unlawful action to abridge the Boy Scouts' Constitutionally protected civil right of Freedom of Association. As a result, the city and the Cradle of Liberty Council engaged in negotiations to transfer the building from the city to the council in exchange for the council not collecting those legal costs from the city. Transfer of the land and building from city to the council would have effectively ended the controversy. While the Boy Scouts offered to then settle the dispute by having the City pay half of the legal fees in return for title to the building and the city accepted, the city council later reneged. On March 2, 2012, the Federal judge then formally ordered the city pay all of the Boy Scouts legal fees and denied the motion for an appeal to settle the matter. The Boy Scouts may also continue reside in the building rent free as they have done since they had paid for construction of the building in 1929. On May 3, 2013, the City withdrew its appeal and agreed to pay the Cradle of Liberty Council $825,000 for improvements made to its building over the past 85 years. In exchange, the Scouts agreed to vacate the property, with the administrative offices leaving by June 30 and the scouting retail store by Oct. 31.

She fought alongside her husband (a corporal in the army) with the Liniers forces that surrounded the Spanish Fortress (now, the Casa Rosada, seat of the Argentine government on Plaza de Mayo), at that moment in British hands. On the second day of the battle, August 11, her husband was killed by a British soldier; in turn, Manuela killed that soldier with her own bayonet. Immediately after, she took her husband‚Äôs musket and continued the fighting, killing another British soldier.Lily Sosa de Newton (1980). \\"Diccionario Biogr√°fico de Mujeres Argentinas\\" (\\"Biographic Dictionary of Argentine Women\\"). Plus Ultra: Buenos Aires. After the battle, Liniers, the commander of the victorious local forces and soon to be appointed Viceroy for the R√≠o de la Plata, named Manuela to the newly formed Patricios Regiment with a salary and the rank of \\"alf√©rez\\" (approximately, second lieutenant). The report by Liniers is displayed in the Museum of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, and reads: Homage There is a street and a school in Buenos Aires named after her. In addition, the Government of the City of Buenos Aires gives the award \\"Menci√≥n de Honor Manuela Pedraza\\" in recognition to women involved in social activism in Argentina.

L√©onel Marie Ghislain Alfred de Moustier, son of Marquis Pierre de Moustier, was born in Paris. His father represented Doubs in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. His grandfather Lionel de Moustier was a diplomat under the Second Empire, and his great-grandfather was a member of the Chamber of Peers. De Moustier served in the French Army during the First World War and received the Croix de guerre 1914-1918 and the L√©gion d'Honneur. He was mayor of Cubry as his father had been before him and in 1928 again followed his father, this time to represent Doubs in the Chamber of Deputies, sitting with the Republican Federation. While principally interested in economic and social affairs, he was later an opponent of any appeasement of Nazi Germany and called for increased military preparedness. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he returned to service with the French Army, then aged 57. After the signing of the armistice with Germany in June 1940, he was one of the 80 who voted against the grant of special powers to Philippe P√©tain and the creation of the Vichy r√©gime. Moustier described the armistice as treason and P√©tain as a traitor and was associated with the French Resistance. He was a district leader in the Organisation de r√©sistance de l'arm√©e, and provided assistance to the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service. He was arrested by the Gestapo on 23 August 1943 and imprisoned first at Besan√ßon and then at Compi√®gne, and was deported to Neuengamme concentration camp in the summer of 1944. He died there shortly after the camp was liberated. He was posthumously made a member of the Ordre de la Lib√©ration. His son Roland de Moustier (1909-2001) was also a politician.

Early life  Alfred Corn was born in Bainbridge, Georgia in 1943 and raised in Valdosta, Georgia. Corn graduated from Emory University in 1965 with a B.A. in French literature and then earned an M.A. in French literature at Columbia University in 1967. During the years 1967-1968 he traveled to Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship with his wife Ann Jones, whom he met three years earlier in France during a summer study program. After he and Ann Jones divorced, he was partnered with the architect Walter Brown in the years 1971‚Äì1976 and then with J.D. McClatchy from 1977 until 1989.  Career  His first book of poems, All Roads at Once, appeared in 1976, followed by A Call in the Midst of the Crowd (1978), The Various Light (1980), Notes from a Child of Paradise (1984), The West Door (1988), Autobiographies (1992). His seventh book of poems, titled Present, appeared in 1997, along with a novel titled Part of His Story., and a study of prosody, The Poem‚Äôs Heartbeat (Story Line Press, 1997; Copper Canyon Press, 2008). Stake: Selected Poems, 1972‚Äì1992, appeared in 1999, followed by Contradictions in 2002. He has also published a collection of critical essays titled The Metamorphoses of Metaphor (1988) and a work of art criticism, Aaron Rose Photographs (Abrams Books, 2001). In January 2013, Tables, a volume of poems, was published by Press53. In April 2014, Unions, a volume of poems, was published by Barrow Street Press. In December 2014, Miranda's Book, a novel, was published by Eyewear Publishing in London, United Kingdom. Corn was awarded the 1982 Levinson Prize by Poetry Magazine. Corn received an Award in Literature from the Academy of Arts and Letters in 1983 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1986. In 1987, he was awarded a Fellowship of the Academy of American Poets. Additional fellowships and prizes awarded for his poetry include the National Endowment for the Arts and a residency at The Bellagio Center for the Rockefeller Foundation.  Teaching  For many years (1983‚Äì2001) he taught in the Graduate Writing Program of the Columbia University School of the Arts and has held visiting posts at UCLA, the City University of New York, the University of Cincinnati, Ohio State University, Oklahoma State University, Sarah Lawrence, Yale University, and the University of Tulsa. As critic, he has written for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Washington Post Book World, and The New Republic. Beginning in 1989 and continuing to the present, he has published reviews and articles for Art in America and ARTnews magazines. For 2004‚Äì2005, he held the Amy Clampitt residency in Lenox, Massachusetts. In 2005‚Äì2006, he lived in London, teaching a course for the Poetry School, and one for the Arvon Foundation at Totleigh Barton, Devon. In 2007 he directed a poetry-writing course at Wroxton College in Oxfordshire, and in 2008 he taught at the Alm√°ssera Vella Arts Center in Spain. His first play, Lowell's Bedlam opened at Pentameters Theatre in London in 2011. He was a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge in 2012 and after his residency was made a Life Fellow. In the same year, he published an e-book, Transatlantic Bridge: A Concise Guide to American and British English, detailing differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar and punctuation.  Critical reception  The critic Harold Bloom singled out Corn's All Roads at Once as the best first book of that year (The New Republic, 1976) and said in a jacket comment for A Call in the Midst of the Crowd: ‚ÄúAlfred Corn‚Äôs second book of poems goes well beyond fulfilling the authentic promise of his first. The title poem is an extraordinary and quite inevitable extension of the New York tradition of major visionary poems, which goes from Poe‚Äôs ‚ÄòCity in the Sea‚Äô and Whitman's ‚ÄòCrossing Brooklyn Ferry‚Äô to Hart Crane's The Bridge and Ashbery's ‚ÄòSelf Portrait in a Convex Mirror.‚Äô Corn achieves an authority and resonance wholly worthy of his precursors. I know of nothing else of such ambition and realized power in Corn's own generation of American poets. He has had the skill and courage to confront, absorb, and renew our poetic tradition at its most vital. His aesthetic prospects are remarkable, even in this crowded time.‚Äù Bloom‚Äôs characterization of these books as belonging to the tradition of American Romanticism was a stimulus for much of the critical attention, positive or negative, focused on Corn during the following decades. Critics and poet-critics as diverse as Richard Howard, Charles Molesworth, Robert B. Shaw, Joel Conarroe, Jay Parini, John Hollander, Wayne Koestenbaum, David Lehmann, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Amy Clampitt, and Carolyn Forch√©, have made penetrating observations about his work.  Corn's work relative to other literary \\"schools\\"  The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (Princeton University Press, 1993) grouped Corn with poets who came to be known as the ‚ÄúNew Formalists‚Äù (see New Formalism) but Corn has never appeared in the anthologies associated with this group. A noticeable percentage of his poetry uses meter, rhyme, and verseform, and he has written a widely circulated introduction to English-language prosody, The Poem‚Äôs Heartbeat. The critic Robert K. Martin, in his The Homosexual Tradition in American Poetry (1979, revised 1998) placed Corn's poetry in a line that begins with Whitman and continues through Crane, Merrill, and Thom Gunn to the present; and Corn has appeared in several anthologies of gay poetry such as The World In Us (2000). But he has also appeared in more general anthologies such as The Norton Anthology of Poetry (Fourth and Fifth Edition, 1996 and 2005) and The Making Of a Poem (Mark Strand and Eavan Boland, 2000). Unusual for a poet, he has published two novels, the first, Part of His Story (favorably reviewed by critic A.O. Scott in The Nation) in 1997. His second, title Miranda's Book was published in the U.K. by Eyewear in 2014, and several short stories have appeared in magazines and anthologies.

The Italian Renaissance Revival building designed by architects Clinton & Russell for William Waldorf Astor, was built between 1906 and 1908; it occupies the full block between Broadway, West End Avenue, and West West 78th and 79th streets. The building, which has been called \\"Monumental and magnificent\\", is built around a large interior courtyard. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1969, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Design  A three-story rusticated base and the rustication of the broader corner bays as well as string moldings serve together to articulate the otherwise block-like mass. Arch-headed windows contrast with rectangular ones to emphasize lightly certain positions, notably the enriched uppermost floor under the projecting cornice. Over- lifesize limestone sculptures representing the Four Seasons stand above the central barrel-vaulted entrance, where the elaborate wrought-iron gates in the manner of Samuel Yellin feature a pair of gazelle heads.

Early life and career An erotic bronze sculpture cast by Bergmann, c. 1910 Bergmann was noted for his detailed and colorful work. He signed with either a letter 'B' in an urn-shaped cartouche or 'Nam Greb' ‚Äì 'Bergman' in reverse. These marks were used to disguise his identity on erotic works. His father, Franz Bergmann (September 26th 1838‚Äì1894), was a professional chaser from Gablonz who came to Vienna and founded a small bronze factory in 1860. Franz Xaver Bergmann inherited the company and opened a new foundry in 1900. Many of the bronzes from the 1900s were still based on designs from his father's workshop. Bergmann is often incorrectly described as a sculptor but he was not; he was a foundry owner. His workshops employed, on a temporary basis, many anonymous sculptors. Bruno Zach employed Bergmann to edit and cast some of his works, with some of the more erotic ones being signed as \\"Prof. Tuch\\", a pseudonym used by Zach. At the turn of the 19th century there were about fifty workshops producing Vienna bronzes. 'Cold-painted bronze' refers to pieces cast in Vienna and then decorated in several layers with so-called dust paint; the know-how for the mix of this kind of paint has been lost. The color was not fired hence 'cold painted'. The painting was carried out mainly by women working at home, a typical cottage industry. Sensuous poses of young women in the Art Nouveau style were disguised by a covering that revealed all when a button was pushed or a lever moved. Often carefully sculpted animals, such as bears, could be opened to reveal an erotic figure inside. Foundry closure The Bergmann foundry was closed in 1930 due to the Great Depression. It was reopened some years later by Robert Bergmann, son of Franz, and operated until his death in 1954 when the remaining stock and molds were sold to Karl Fuhrmann & Co.  Trivia  The playwright Henrik Ibsen had a small group of such characters which he referred to as his \\"devil orchestra\\"; a black boy climbing up a ladder on an elephant, a cat chewing another with rice twigs, singing after sheet music, writing, directing, devils pulling each other in wheelbarrows or carrying inkwells between them, a frog on ashtray playing on banjo . Ibsen used these as inspiration: \\"There should be Troll in what I write,\\" he said.Erik Henning Edvardsen: Ibsen-museet. The Ibsen Museum. Oslo 1998, p. 22. Some of the characters were reported missing from the exhibitions on October 6, 1980, and has never returned. The rest of the characters are safely preserved at the playwright's desk in Ibsenmuseet in Oslo. File: Devil's orchestra 01.jpg  Two small devils carrying inkwells between them.

Playing career Roy McGiffen played amateur hockey from age 15 with the Coldwater Hockey Club, moving from there to Toronto Simcoe, Toronto Amateur Athletic Club and back to Toronto Simcoe for 1909‚Äì10. He played the 1911‚Äì12 season for Cleveland of the United States Amateur Hockey Association, before turning professional with the Toronto Blueshirts in 1912‚Äì13. He played three seasons with the Blueshirts before retiring after the 1914‚Äì15 season. In the 1914 Stanley Cup challenge of Victoria against the Blueshirts, McGiffen scored the game-winning goal of game two.Coleman(1966), pg. 264 That season, he led the league in penalty fines of $116. In a 17 February 1915 regular-season game against the Ottawa Senators, McGiffen became involved in a fight with Art Ross that ended with both players being arrested by Toronto police. After spending the night in jail, both players were fined $1. McGiffen lost a coin toss with Ross and paid both fines. The referee of the match Cooper Smeaton wanted McGiffin barred from the league, denouncing him as a rough player. After the 1914‚Äì15 season, he quit hockey for business and moved to Dinuba, California. He had lived there previously for a year from 1910‚Äì11 after his junior hockey days. In June 1917 he married Lillian Schroeder of San Francisco. McGiffen served in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I, and was an instructor of aerobatics.

The term was first used in 1974 by Erna Knutsen in an issue of Tea & Coffee Trade Journal. Knutsen used specialty coffee to describe beans of the best flavor which are produced in special micro-climates. Specialty coffee is related to what is known as the Third Wave of Coffee, especially throughout North America. This refers to a modern demand for exceptional quality coffee, both farmed and brewed to a significantly higher than average standard.  Definition  The widely accepted definition of specialty coffee is coffee scoring 80 points or above on the 100-point Coffee Review scale. Coffee scoring from 90-100 is graded Outstanding, coffee that scores 85-89.99 is graded Excellent, while coffee scoring 80-84.99 is graded Very Good. The Specialty Coffee Association has a series of more detailed specifications (SCA is the union of the Specialty Coffee Association of American (SCAA) and Europe (SCAE)). The SCA sets standards for specialty coffee at every stage of the coffee production, including allowable defects in green beans, water standards, and brew strength. The SCA also sets clear standards on the coffee grading process. A minimum requirement for a specialty coffee is the number of defects: to be considered specialty a coffee must have 0 to 5 defects every 350gr of milled beans. Although there are different definitions of specialty coffee according to different international organisation, there's a general acceptance of a set of three minimum requirements: coffee should have been hand picked by selective picking of mature beans, scoring 80 or above, maximum 5 defects per 350gr. Many organisations and activists are working to include strict environmental and social indicators in the definition and grading of specialty coffee. For example biologist Giorgio Piracci, president of the Peruvian NGO 7Elements Peru and producer of the first specialty coffee produced applying permaculture ethics and principles, argues that \\"there's a urgent need to redefine the concept of quality and to embed into it the environmental and socio-economic quality component both at production and distribution level\\"; according to his vision, \\"it makes no sense to talk about an \\"excellent\\" coffee if this is produced using harmful pesticides, fertilisers or environmentally impacting farming techniques; in the same way, \\"how can we talk about excellence if a cup of coffee is produced thanks to modern forms of slavery and human exploitation?\\" . Similar positions are often promoted by Fernando Morales-de La Cruz, journalist and founder of Coffee for Change, an organisation fighting against the use of child labour in the coffee industry; the journalist is very active also in showing up how the labelling system of \\"Fair trade\\" is often used although poor, unfair economic conditions for farmers. In a recent interview, at a European Parliament hearing on child labor in cocoa & coffee, Ange Aboa a Reuters correspondent for West & Central Africa said \\"certifications Fairtrade, UTZ & RainforestAlliance are the biggest scam of the century!\\". Morales-de La Cruz stated that \\" It's unacceptable and illegal that seventy years after signing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Europe's \\"Fairtrade\\" coffee, tea & cocoa is grown with slave & child labor. The European Union is the largest importer of coffee in the world. In 2019 Europe paid poor coffee growers 75% less than in 1983\\".  Growing Locations  In general, coffee is grown in the ‚ÄòBean Belt‚Äô, between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which produce the tropical climate required for trees to thrive. Speciality coffee is typically grown in three continents: South and Central Americas, Asia, and Africa. The world‚Äôs most expensive specialty coffee is Panama Geisha coffee, which has been sold for over US$800 per pound.  Specialty Coffee Consumption  In Australia and New Zealand, specialty coffee is considered mainstream with major specialty wholesalers like Campos coffee supplying hundreds of Australian cafes. This is perhaps partly due to a long history of espresso consumption, fuelled by large Italian and Greek migrations in the mid-twentieth century. While specialty coffee in North America is rarely offered in major coffee chains, the Third Wave of Coffee has resulted in a significant increase in specialty coffee consumption. Independent, ‚ÄòAustralian-style‚Äô, or artisan cafes have opened in multiple cities. An SCAA report estimated the US had 29,300 specialty coffee shops in 2013, up from 2,850 in 1993. Europe is already a major coffee market accounting for 30% of global consumption, but is seeing a growth in demand for specialty coffee while overall demand remains stable. In 2016, specialty coffee was Europe‚Äôs fastest growing major restaurant category, with an increase of 9.1% from 2014-2015. Western Europe saw a particularly large growth of 10.5% in the specialty cafe market, while the overall coffee industry reduced by 1.5%, perhaps due to a longer history of coffee consumption. Asia is projected to soon represent the world‚Äôs largest consumer of specialty coffee, with over US$3.7 billion in new value growth projected from 2016-2020. Despite Asia being traditionally dominated by tea consumption, it is now easy to find specialty coffee shops across many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cities. There have also been increases in the consumption of coffee from countries traditionally responsible for growing coffee. Brazil‚Äôs overall coffee consumption in 2014 was 21 million bags, close to that of the US at 23.4 million bags. Guatemala is also experiencing a surge in popularity of specialty coffee.

Donna gives her a Secretech, a device for secretaries that helps organize events and has Raven conduct a video conference on it. She assures Donna that she knows how to use one, even though she doesn't, and no one can help her. She accidentally sends the photographer, Pistache, to the Tipton in Milan, Italy. Also, the models (Juan and Kvelte) did not get their plane ticket from Raven, so the models are stuck in the made-up country of Budapragoslovakia. While Raven is talking to Zack and Cody she has a vision. She tells them to put their hands out and they end up catching a celebrity, Tyler (Tiffany Thornton) which is how she gets the twins to help her. As a result, Raven substitutes the fashion models with Zack and Cody, and she pretends to be Pistache. Donna Cabonna finds out the bad news so she tries to take matters into her own hands by impersonating the photographer too. As the two Pistache impersonators are doing the photo shoot, the real Pistache comes in, having arrived by \\"an outrageously expensive private jet\\" (billed to Donna Cabona). She notes that Zack and Cody are not the models she chose, but they are even better. She tells them to turn around and she takes pictures of their backs. The episode seems to end on a happy note with Raven's vision that has Donna Cabonna saying that the boy's line is a success. However, the episode turns sour when Raven misses her flight because her Secretech has the wrong time in Boston which is 3 hours ahead from San Francisco. Meanwhile, Cory and Eddie find out that Chelsea is a natural at paddleball, so they try to get Chelsea to break the record for the world's longest paddleball session so they can claim the prize money. They think they have the record in the bag until the competition‚Äînone other than Stanley‚Äîproves to be a formidable paddle ball opponent. Chelsea scams Stanley and wins the title and prize money. She then feels bad and ends up giving Stanley the money. Cory and Eddie are furious with Chelsea because Stanley has scammed her. Chelsea responds that not only does she not feel scammed but both she and Stanley got what they wanted, the record and the money respectively. When Eddie and Cory protest that they did not get what they wanted (a share of the prize money), she slyly responds that they \\"got what they deserved\\" (which was nothing). Then she proceeds to break the record for the longest paddleball session behind her back. That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana (from The Suite Life of Zack & Cody) After the Tipton's concierge, Irene, tells Raven that her flight is cancelled, Raven is stuck in Boston for the weekend. She then has a vision that Cody is in danger of being attacked. Raven tells them that she has a \\"feeling\\" that the one in a sweater vest is in trouble and should avoid sneezing followed by bells. Cody, the only twin that wears sweater vests, becomes paranoid and avoids anything that remotely resembles Raven's vision ‚Äì even the surprise birthday party that he, Zack, and the other Tipton employees are throwing for Carey. Zack then switches clothes with Cody to make him go to the party and wears his black sweater vest to Carey's surprise party while Cody wears one of his other shirts. However he ends up landing head first in the vanilla flavor birthday cake when Arwin's babysitting machine, his gift to Carey, goes out of control. Meanwhile, Maddie is trying to help Raven by getting London to wear one of Raven's original designs, but London swears she'll never wear anything that's not from a famous designer ‚Äì even her diapers were made by designers. Maddie then switches the label of London's Attoro Vittali and sews it onto Raven's dress. London wears the dress thinking that it is a Vittali original. Maddie tells her the truth, and London gets upset that Maddie tricked her into wearing a dress that wasn't made by a famous person, but changes her mind when teen pop star Hannah Montana checks in and admires Raven's dress, asking her to make a similar one, to which she replies that it is a \\"one-of-a-kind Raven Baxter original made only for her \\" (London). Later, Hannah starts a catfight with London over the dress, and Raven is overjoyed by this, but as Hannah goes up to London to get a closer look of the dress, her ring gets caught in it and it tears (off camera), much to Raven's upset. On the Road Again (from Hannah Montana) When Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart stays at the Tipton, she befriends the candy counter girl Maddie Fitzpatrick. Listening to Miley's dad sing, Maddie says that he sounds just like Robbie Ray, the \\"Honkytonk Heartthrob\\", before realizing that he is Robbie Ray. Apparently both she and her mother were Robbie Ray fans. When Maddie talks to Hannah/Miley about his career back in the day, Miley starts to believe that her father gave up his dream to sing so that Miley could pursue her own career as Hannah Montana. To give him back the stage life, she recruits the help of his former manager to get Robby back on the road. Robby goes to San Diego while Hannah's bodyguard Roxy Roker takes care of Miley and her brother Jackson. Unfortunately, Roxy is very overprotective and will not let the children go out of her sight, and even ties them up along with her when they sleep. Jackson gets fed up and goes to San Diego, followed by Miley and Roxy. Billy Ray Cyrus (as Robbie Ray) performs \\"I Want My Mullet Back\\" in this episode. However, upon watching his father's performance and hearing about him being offered to go on tour in Hawaii with Toby Keith, Jackson changes his mind. However, Robby decides not to go on the tour because he doesn't want to leave his kids again. Maddie then also shows up, but is chased away by Roxy. At the end of the episode, both Robby and Miley perform an encore performance of \\"I Want My Mullet Back\\", complete with mullet wigs and Jackson, also wearing a mullet, doing the underarm trumpet. DVD release The DVD release (released as the \\"Mixed-Up Mashed-Up Edition\\") was released on January 16, 2007. The disc includes one extra for each of its featured series, with the trivia game \\"So You Think You Know Raven, Volume 2\\" (a continuation of a game from the DVD release of \\"That's So Raven: Raven's Makeover Madness\\"), a never-before-seen episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\\" (\\"Health and Fitness\\", which was later aired in March 2007), and the Hannah Montana music video \\"Who Said\\".

Chemical transport models and general circulation models  While related general circulation models (GCMs) focus on simulating overall atmospheric dynamics (e.g. fluid and heat flows), a CTM instead focuses on the stocks and flows of one or more chemical species. Similarly, a CTM must solve only the continuity equation for its species of interest, a GCM must solve all the primitive equations for the atmosphere; but a CTM will be expected to accurately represent the entire cycle for the species of interest, including fluxes (e.g. advection), chemical production/loss, and deposition. That being said, the tendency, especially as the cost of computing declines over time, is for GCMs to incorporate CTMs for species of special interest to climate dynamics, especially shorter-lived species such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds; this allows feedbacks from the CTM to the GCM's radiation calculations, and also allows the meteorological fields forcing the CTM to be updated at higher time resolution than may be practical in studies with offline CTMs.  Types of chemical transport models  CTMs may be classified according to their methodology and their species of interest, as well as more generic characteristics (e.g. dimensionality, degree of resolution).

Personal life She was born Janice Meredith Holt on March 28, 1905, in Altus, Arkansas to John Albert Holt and Lucy Elizabeth (n√©e McGraw); both her parents were teachers. She had two younger siblings, Mary Katherine Holt Sullivan (July 9, 1907 - January 8, 1995) and John Albert Holt Jr. (born 1909). Janice Holt worked for a number of years with a number of church-affiliated clerical jobs, first in Oklahoma and then in Kentucky, having moved to Frankfort in 1939 subsequent to her divorce that year from her first husband Otto Moore, whom she had wed in 1927. In 1941 Janice Holt obtained a position as secretary at the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1945 Janice Holt married Henry Giles, who was eleven years her junior. After first becoming acquainted on a 40-hour bus trip in 1943, the couple had subsequently courted via letters to and from Europe, where Henry Giles was serving in the military, and were married the same day Henry returned to the United States. The couple lived in Louisville until 1949, when they took up residence in Adair County within two miles of the area where Henry's ancestors had settled in 1803. They subsequently constructed a house, which took four years to complete, from the logs of four pioneer cabins. They lived there until Janice died of congestive heart failure in 1979. Henry Giles died in 1986 and was buried next to Janice in the Caldwell Chapel Separate Baptist Church cemetery in Knifley. Writing Janice Holt Giles began her writing career with an entry to a fiction contest in 1949 while still working at the Presbyterian Seminary in Louisville. Between 1950 and 1975 Giles wrote twenty-four books which were published. Noted primarily for her historical novels set in Kentucky - beginning with her debut novel The Enduring Hills - or on the Western frontier, she also wrote contemporary fiction set in the Kentucky hills, as well as autobiographical and nonfiction works, some of them co-authored with Henry. Her works include the Piney Woods trilogy, consisting of The Enduring Hills (1950), Miss Willie (1951), and Tara's Healing (1952), and the Kentucky trilogy, consisting of The Kentuckians (1953), Hannah Fowler (1956), and The Believers (1957). The Janice Holt Giles and Henry Giles Society was established in 1996 to preserve the literary legacy of Janice Holt Giles and Henry Giles and to restore their log home. Giles's historical fiction works form a study of early American pioneer life in Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico among other states. Her accounts are accurate geographically and historically and are tied together by the fictitious Cooper, Fowler and Cartwright families. Real historical figures from Giles's novels include Ben Logan, Daniel Boone, James Harrod, William Whitley, James Wilkinson, Gen. Matthew Arbuckle, and Sam Houston. She also provides a realistic historical perspective of the relationships between Native Americans, White Settlers and African Americans.

A contingent proposition is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false. Propositions that are contingent may be so because they contain logical connectives which, along with the truth value of any of its atomic parts, determine the truth value of the proposition. This is to say that the truth value of the proposition is contingent upon the truth values of the sentences which comprise it. Contingent propositions depend on the facts, whereas analytic propositions are true without regard to any facts about which they speak. Along with contingent propositions, there are at least three other classes of propositions, some of which overlap: * Tautological propositions, which must be true, no matter what the circumstances are or could be (example: \\"It is the case that the sky is blue or it is not the case that the sky is blue.\\"). * Contradictions which must necessarily be untrue, no matter what the circumstances are or could be (example: \\"It's raining and it's not raining.\\"). * Possible propositions, which are true or could have been true given certain circumstances (examples: x + y = 4; There are only three planets; There are more than three planets). All necessarily true propositions, and all contingent propositions, are also possible propositions. Relativism in rhetoric Attempts in the past by philosophers and rhetoricians to allocate to rhetoric its own realm have ended with attempting to contain rhetoric within the domain of contingent and relative matters. Aristotle explained in Rhetoric, \\"The duty of rhetoric is to deal with such matters as we deliberate upon without arts or systems to guide us...\\"Aristotle. Rhetoric. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. New York: Random House, 1954. Aristotle stresses the contingent because no one deliberates on the necessary or impossible. He believed that the \\"unavoidable and potentially unmanageable presence of multiple possibilities\\" or the complex nature of decisions creates and invites rhetoric. Aristotle's view challenges the view of Plato, who said that rhetoric had no subject matter except for deceit, and gives rhetoric its position at the pinnacle of political debate. Contemporary scholars argue that if rhetoric is merely about the contingent, it automatically excludes that which is either necessary or impossible. The \\"necessary\\" is that which either must be done or will inevitably be done. The \\"impossible\\" is that which will never be done; therefore, it will not be deliberated over. For example, the United States Congress will not convene tomorrow to discuss something necessary, such as whether or not to hold elections, or something impossible, such as outlawing death. Congress convenes to discuss problems, different solutions to those problems, and the consequences of each solution. This again raises the question of contingency because that which is deemed necessary or impossible depends almost entirely on time and perspective. In United States history, there was a time when even a congressman who opposed slavery would conclude that its retraction would be impossible. The same held true for those who favored women's suffrage. Today in the United States, slavery has been abolished and women have the right to vote. In this way, although rhetoric viewed across time is entirely contingent and includes a broader definition, rhetoric taken moment-by-moment is much more narrow and excludes both the necessary and the impossible. When faced with decisions, people will choose one option at the exclusion of the others.Gaonkar, Dilip Parameshwar. \\"Contingency and Probability.\\" Encyclopedia of Rhetoric. Ed. Thomas O. Sloane. New York: Oxford UP, 2001. 156. This inevitably produces unforeseen consequences. Because of these consequences, decision makers must deliberate and choose. Another problem arises when one asks where this knowledge of what issues are \\"necessary\\" and \\"impossible\\" originates and how the knowledge can be applied to others. Rhetorician Robert L. Scott answers this problem by asserting that while rhetoric is indeed contingent and relative, it is also epistemic.Scott, Robert L. \\"On Viewing Rhetoric As Epistemic.\\" Central States Speech Journal 18 (1967), p. 9. Thus, for Scott, what should be debated is a matter of rhetoric, as individuals make meaning through language and determine what constitutes truth, and therefore, what is beyond question and debate. Theorist Lloyd Bitzer makes five assumptions about rhetoric in his book Rhetoric, Philosophy, and Literature: An Exploration.Bitzer, Lloyd F. \\"Rhetoric and Public Knowledge.\\" Rhetoric, Philosophy and Literature: An Exploration. Ed. D.M. Burks, p.70. West Lafayette, IN, 1978. # Rhetoric is a method for inquiring into and communicating about the contingent. # This inquiry does not yield certain knowledge, but only opinion. # The proper mode of working in this realm is deliberation that relies on reasonable judgment. # This deliberation and decision making is audience centered. # This engagement with the audience is constrained by time. The study of contingency and relativism as it pertains to rhetoric draws from poststructuralist and postfoundationalist theory. Richard Rorty and Stanley Fish are leading theorists in this area of study at the intersection of rhetoric and contingency.

Released theatrically on January 17, 1955, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. Plot Woody is happily singing \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" after building a brand new birdhouse out of a tree until neighborhood dog Happy sets fire to the woodpecker's domicile who then laughs at Woody's misfortune after he was annoyed by Woody's pecking. Frustrated, Woody moves into another birdhouse, only to have it thrown over the side of a mountain by a malicious Happy who laughs again. Soon, it begins raining, and Happy at first goes into his dog house happy at what he did to Woody, but Woody takes revenge on Happy by pecking his dog house to nothing, forcing Happy to take refuge to his owner's home. The kindly mother Phoebe takes the dog in, but her towering husband Claude complains that she is letting the wet dog into the house. A soaked Woody then knocks on the door as well, and Phoebe takes pity on the drenched woodpecker. Claude, who openly declares \\"I hate animals!\\" angrily inquires, \\"What is this: a zoo?!\\" He then storms off to bed. Only moments after Happy and Woody try to get some sleep and began fighting, Claude begins sleepwalking and works his way right into the refrigerator. This leads to a series of mishaps resulting in Happy getting booted out of the house repeatedly. Finally, Claude's bed ends up landing in the basement, and he quickly accuses Happy (who tried to saw off the ground on which Woody's bed stood, but Woody himself replaced it with the couch on which Claude was sleeping). The frantic dog rolls up the saw he used, and hides it in his mouth. Woody then comes up behind him, asks \\"Hiya, pal! What's new?\\" and slaps his back, causing the saw to unroll in his mouth. Happy then bounces off into the night, with the saw twanging away inside his body. Woody tries to win Claude's friendship by jokingly saying that Happy was a saw head (funny way of saying sore head), but gets booted out in the rain. Phoebe comes running down the stairs to rescue the woodpecker, leading Claude to threaten \\"Phoebe, either that woodpecker goes, or I go!\\" Phoebe then promptly throws Claude out the door, and tucks Woody into bed with Woody saying \\"You're a nice lady\\".

Col. Earl O. Cullum (left) and Capt. Joseph J. Armand (right) with Herman Perry (center) after the manhunt. Herman Perry (May 16, 1922 ‚Äì March 15, 1945) was an African-American soldier serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, who deserted after killing an unarmed, white lieutenant attempting an arrest on him. After being sentenced to death, he escaped custody, and a man-hunt was launched while he lived in the jungle. Perry was eventually re-captured and once again court-martialed, later hanged for murder and desertion, making him the only American executed in the China Burma India Theater during World War II.Koerner, Brendan I. 'Now the Hell Will Start: One Soldier's Flight from the Greatest Manhunt of World War II'. New York: Penguin Press, 2008: 142. Biography He was born near Monroe, North Carolina. As a soldier in the army's 849th Engineer Bn. he served in the China-Burma-India Theater, helping to construct the Ledo Road. On March 3, 1944, Perry's CO, Lt. Harold Cady, attempted to apprehend him for dereliction of duty and place him in the area's military prison. Perry had previously served time in this prison and was well aware of the abuses that went on there. When he was found he was holding a rifle and repeatedly warned Cady not to approach him and to \\"Get back.\\" Cady continued to advance and Perry fired his rifle, killing Cady. He fled into the wilderness and lived out a fugitive's life of jungle survival, happenstance finding a morung; a bamboo structure on stilts built over a pig sty, which served as a bachelors‚Äô quarter for a tribe of the Naga people of northeastern India and northern Burma. It is unknown exactly how Perry managed to win the tribe over, but his familiarity with their language undoubtedly helped and he also offered them goods which he had taken from the military store. After adapting to the headhunting lifestyle of the tribe which the Ang, or village chief, told him was called Tgum Ga by the Burmese, he eventually won the Ang's respect and approval to the extent that he even married the Ang's 14-year-old daughter with whom he also had a child. The Army appointed Lt. Col. Earl Owen Cullum, a former Dallas police officer and Commander of the 159th Military Police Battalion in the China Burma India Theater, to lead the manhunt. Perry was nearly caught twice by the Army but escaped both times. The initial encounter left Perry simply grazed on the ankle by a bullet, but by the second he suffered more serious wounds that injured his Achilles tendon. After being captured in the third encounter, he was court-martialed for murder and convicted, being sentenced to death on September 4, 1944.Koerner, Brendan I. The Greatest Manhunt of World War II. Slate Magazine, March 29, 2008. He was finally captured in Assam on March 9, 1945, and his death sentence‚Äîby hanging‚Äîwas carried out on March 15. His story was initially covered up by Army leadership, but soon-after revealed by the same leader of the manhunt, Lt. Col. Earl Owen Cullum.. Years later, Cullum would further publicize his first-hand accounts of the chase in his personally-published book, \\"Manhunt in Burma and Assam: World War II in the China-Burma-India Theater\\". The Herman Perry story would later be republicized in 2008 as Now the Hell Will Start: One Soldier's Flight From the Greatest Manhunt of World War II by Brendan I. Koerner; George Pelecanos called it \\"A fascinating, untold story of the Second World War, an incendiary social document, and a thrilling, campfire tale adventure.\\" Other major news outlets would later pick up the story as a greater, complex reflection of race relations between African Americans and commanding white officers in the military, especially during the Jim Crow era.

The First Charlotte County Gaol Charlotte County Jail and Courthouse The first prison in Charlotte County, New Brunswick was located in St. Andrews, New Brunswick on Water Street near where the current town hall is today. Built in 1786, just three years after the town was settled, it was a wooden building that consisted of four cells on the bottom floor and a courthouse on the upper floor. Since the floors in the cells were only packed dirt, prisoners found that they could readily escape custody. Eventually so many escaped that in 1828 the Sheriff was sued, and thus an act was passed to erect a more suitable prison elsewhere. The old building was sold to the town of St. Andrews and converted into a town hall and market house until it burned down in 1872. The Second Charlotte County Gaol The next prison, now known as the \\"Old Gaol,\\" was constructed in an attempt to correct all that was wrong about the previous one. It was built in 1832 on Frederick Street in St. Andrews at the cost of ¬£3,393, a very large sum for the time. Massive slabs of gray granite were cut in Perry, Maine and laid as the floors, ceilings and walls of the prison. Cell doors were made of solid iron, each with a sliding bolt to keep the door closed at all times. The only source of light was the small hole in the door used for delivering food to the prisoners and a small window measuring four inches wide and twelve inches high. Doorways were made very narrow so that a prisoner, no matter their size, would have trouble overpowering the Gaoler if they were being let out of the cell for any reason. The only source of heat was a small wood stove at the end of the corridor outside of the cells, leading a Gaoler in the 1930s to add wooden walls to the cells in an effort to keep them warmer. Unfortunately, this approach led the cells to be only colder as it kept the warmth of the stove outside of the cells. These ten cells were used exclusively for male prisoners. They occupy the first floor of the Gaol and are six by eight feet in size. The cells are cold, claustrophobic and bereft of any comfort, which was the exact intention of their construction. Upstairs in the Gaol were four cells intended for women, children and debtors. These were much more comfortable than the ones downstairs as they were larger in size and had larger windows for more light. Children would be admitted to prison if their mother had committed a crime and there were no other caretakers available. Debtors made up a large bulk of the prison population until the practice of imprisoning debtors ended in 1939. The Old Gaol was used, though only as a place of temporary custody, until 1979, despite protests of its unacceptable conditions from the public and Gaolers as early as the 1940s. Today, the Old Gaol houses the Charlotte County Archives and its extensive collections. The downstairs cells remain unchanged and are open to the public.All information, Charlotte County Archives See also *Charlotte County Court House References External links *Charlotte County Archives Category:Prisons in New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Charlotte County, New Brunswick Category:1786 establishments in New Brunswick Category:Tourist attractions in Charlotte County, New Brunswick Category:Defunct prisons in Canada Category:1979 disestablishments in Canada ","title":"Charlotte County Gaol"},{"id":"17753452","text":"Monica Jo Mancini (born May 4, 1952) is an American singer and the daughter of composer Henry Mancini.

Along with many founding drugstore chain executives, he helped to build the architecture of NACDS and the entire drugstore chain industry. The roots of NACDS date back to the Thirties, when several drugstore owners met at the Vanderbilt Hotel in New York City. That eventually led to a more formal association galvanized by Bolger and located in Virginia - close enough to be a power on Capitol Hill. Robert J. Bolger helped to forge both the philosophical identity and physical home of NACDS. He understood, and sought to address the needs of a diverse membership in an evolving business and public policy environment. He led the initiative to secure the land and construct NACDS' current headquarters offices in Alexandria, Virginia. During his time at NACDS, he expanded the government affairs activities. Robert J. Bolger pushed this because he understood the importance of legislative and government affairs in the industry. Because of his understanding of the importance of government relations the pharmaceutical industry the Pharmaceutical lobby became what it is today.

It involved the kidnapping and the subsequent murder of siblings Geeta and Sanjay by Kuljeet Singh (alias Ranga Khus) and Jasbir Singh (alias Billa). The children were kidnapped for ransom but, on learning their father was a naval officer, both were killed. Geeta was allegedly raped before being murdered, but forensic evidence could not confirm it. The kidnappers had initially admitted to raping her but later retracted the statement. The two kidnappers were convicted and sentenced to death. The execution was carried out in 1982. Crime Patrol Dial 100 aired two episodes 723 & 724 on Sony TV based on the story on Feb 28, 2018 and Mar 1, 2018. The case was also shown on TV series Bhanwar which was based on real life court cases. Kidnapping Geeta Chopra was a 16¬Ω-year-old 2nd year student in the Jesus and Mary College, New Delhi. Her brother, Sanjay, was 14-year-old student in the 10th standard of the Modern School. Their father, Madan Mohan Chopra, was a Captain in the Indian Navy. They lived in the Officer's Enclave in Dhaula Kuan. On Saturday 26 August 1978, Geeta and Sanjay were supposed to participate in a radio programme called the Yuva Vani on All India Radio. They were to reach the All India Radio office on the Sansad Marg by 7 pm. Their father was supposed to pick them up outside the All India Radio after programme at 9 pm. The siblings left their house at 6:15 pm. A man, Kula Nand saw them at the roundabout at Dhaula Kuan. A man named M. S. Nanda gave the children a lift from Dhaula Kuan to Gole Dak Khana as it was drizzling. At 6:30 pm, Bhagwan Dass had noticed a mustard colour Fiat car, while travelling from Gurudwara Bangla Sahib towards North Avenue, near the yoga ashram at Gole Dak Khana. He heard noises coming from the car, so he stopped his scooter and approached. He saw a girl pulling the hair of the driver and a boy fighting the passenger by the driver. Dass could not stop the car and it sped away towards Willingdon Hospital. Several other people had tried to stop the car. One man named Babu Lal, dropped his bicycle and tried to grab the door handle of the car but failed. Dass reported this to the police. At 6:45 pm, he called the police control room and told them the license number of the car as HRK 8930, but it was noted by the operator as MRK 8930. Dass also reported that the girl was shouting for help. Inderjeet Singh, a junior engineer in the Delhi Development Authority returning home from work on his scooter, saw the car on Baba Kharak Singh Marg near the casualty block of the Willingdon Hospital. He noticed a girl and a boy sitting in the rear struggling with the driver and another man. He drove up and lined up with the running car. The boy showed his bleeding shoulder to Inderjeet Singh and waved his hands at him pleading for help. Inderjeet followed the car onto Shankar road. But he lost car when it jumped a red light at a traffic crossing at 6:45 pm. Inderjeet noted the correct number of the car and reported it to the Rajendra Nagar, Delhi. The police were slow in their reaction as they considered it a cognisable offence and that it was outside their jurisdiction as they could not proceed without taking permission from the Meerut High Court. At 8 pm, their parents tuned in the radio to listen to their programme but another girl had been given the slot. The parents assumed that they had tuned to the wrong station or the programme was cancelled. Their father took his scooter from home at 8:45 pm to reach the radio office. He did not find his children at the appointed place. On being asked, he was told at the office, the children did not arrive. The father called home to ask if the children had reached home; their mother replied in negative. Their father returned home and called his relatives and friends to ask if the children were with them. At 10:15 pm, the kidnappers had gone to the Willingdon Hospital for a car with the number DHI 280, as one of them, Billa, had acquired a cut injury on his head. The hospital had taken a skiagraph of his skull. One of them left a fingerprint on the skiagraph. On being asked, they gave the doctors false names and said they were hurt by some thieves. The constable on duty at the hospital, Ranbir Singh, took their statement in which they said they were attacked near Kali mandir on Bangla Sahib road, their watch was stolen, and the injury was from an iron rod. Ranbir Singh informed the Mandir Marg police station. At 10:50 pm, two policemen dispatched from the Mandir Marg station to further question them arrived at the hospital. At 11:10 pm, the two decided to leave against doctor's advice. The two policemen, Sub- Inspector Ram Chander and Constable Harish Ram, asked them to accompany them to the spot where they were supposedly robbed. They took them to the spot in their car. Chander failed to find signs of struggle. They asked the duo to take them back to the station. At 1:45 am, they left the station, but they were asked to report again in the morning. When they did not, Chander went to their addresses but found them to be false. Chander inquired with the Regional Transport Office and found the vehicle number belonged to a scooter. Investigation and media attention The police control room forwarded the report from Dass to Mandir Marg police station. The report was given to sub- inspector Om Prakash at 7:05 pm. He went to the Gole Dak Khana to search for witnesses but could not find any. He returned to the station at 9:55 pm. Inderjeet's report had invoked no response. At 10:15 pm, the father called the police and gave them the descriptions of the children. The father searched places where the children might have possibly gone to, including the Willingdon Hospital and returned home at 11:30 pm. The bodies were discovered by a cowherd, Dhani Ram, grazing his cows in Delhi Ridge on 28 August 1978, at 6 pm. The cowherd reported the bodies to a patrolling constable, Rohtas Singh, at 12:00 am. Sub-inspector Hari Chand was sent to the site. The parents were called to the site the identify the bodies. They identified them as their children. The autopsy was conducted by the police surgeon, Bharat Singh, on 29 August. He found the bodies to be in an advanced stage of decomposition. He could not establish sexual assault of the girl due to the decomposition. He found multiple stab wounds and a broken jaw on the girl. He confirmed multiple stab wounds on the boy. The father decided to go to the media. Some newspapers carried photographs. On seeing such a newspaper, M. S. Nanda came and gave his statement. The police in course of their investigation suspected the duo to be involved. They released the photos to the press and reward was announced. The Mumbai Police was informed. On 31 August, a car matching the kidnapping vehicle was found in Majlis Park with the number, DHD 7034. A car had been reported missing of the same make, but number DEA 1221, so the police called the owner Ashok Sharma. The car had been stolen from outside the Ashoka Hotel within six weeks of its purchase. Sharma was able to open the car with his keys. The stereo and speakers were missing. The car's white grille had been replaced with black one. Two witnesses who lived in the area later said they had seen a man driving the car and he had asked them for directions. The car was examined by investigators from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory. Several fingerprints were obtained from the car. A cigarette butt and hair samples were found and taken. Bloodstains were discovered. Plates with the numbers DEA 1221, HRF 5411, and HRK 8930 were found in the car. In the lab, it was later found that one of the plate originally had the number DHI 280 but it had been painted over. Similarly, another number DHD 3548 was found. Some soil samples taken from the floor mat matched the soil samples from the site where the bodies were found. The story got much media attention in India. Prime Minister Morarji Desai took personal interest in the case. The Janata Party which was in power in 1978 Delhi was criticised for their handling for the case. They lost the subsequent election. Arrest and interrogation The kidnappers were arrested on a train a few weeks later on 8 September 1978. On that day, the two kidnappers boarded the Kalka Mail when it had slowed near the Yamuna river bridge near Agra. The compartment they entered was reserved for military personnel, so they were asked to show their identity cards. They started a scuffle with the army-men and were suppressed. Lance Naik A. V. Shetty recognised them from a newspaper picture. On 9 September 1978, they were handed over to Inspector V. P. Gupta, at the New Delhi railway station. They were held in separate non-adjoining cells. On searching, their bags the police found a sword. Their clothes were found with bloodstains. The doctor examining them found bruises on their arms and bodies, some of which were recent from the scuffle. The doctor found the sutures on Billa's head and estimated that to be 15 days old. A wound on Ranga's forearm was found to be 15 days old. Fingerprints, saliva, blood and hair samples were taken on 12 September. On 13 September, on Billa's directions they were driven separately to Agra, where the police recovered a sword from a rented room in Sita Nagar, Agra where they were staying. Trial Confessions On 22 September, Ranga made a voluntary confession which was recorded by a metropolitan magistrate, but the statement was later retracted by him on 20 November. On 19 October, Billa gave a similar confession, but later retracted it on 27 October. The confessions were later held to be independent as they had been kept in non-adjoining cells. Evidences The hair found in the car and on the body of the boy matched that of Ranga. His fingerprints were found in the car. The bloodstains on his shirt belonged to blood group AB, which was a match with the siblings. Billa's hair was found on the body of the girl, and blood matching his blood group A was found in the car. Blood of group AB was found on his clothes. The signature at the Willingdon Hospital matched that of Billa. The skiagrams of the skulls matched. Defence and alibi They pleaded not guilty. Billa claimed that he was in Bombay from 25 August to 1 September. He said he had acquired the head wound while trying to steal a car in Agripada, Bombay. Billa claimed he was forced to make a false confession. He said he was wanted by the Bombay police for false cases, so he had fled to Delhi with Ranga. They had come to Delhi on 15 August. On 18 August, they went to Panipat where Ranga's sister lived. On 25 August, left for Bombay. On 28, he got his head wound. On 31 August, he left for Delhi, where he was informed by Ranga that they were wanted for the murders. They then tried to hide out in Delhi. They were trying to escape to Madras via Delhi when they were caught by the army-men. He claimed to have been tortured by the police to make the confession. Ranga said that the sword was planted on him and that when his clothes were taken from him they had no bloodstains. They also produced witnesses to establish Billa's alibi. Witnesses Two doctors from the Willingdon Hospital who examined Billa on the night of 26 August could not positively identify him. The radiographer opined that the original skiagraph of that man matched with the recent skiagraph of Billa's. Sub-inspector Chander could positively identify the two. Sohan Lal, a landlord in Majlis Park, identified and said that they had rented a room from him on 24 August and stayed there till 31 August. He said that he had seen a bandage on Billa's head on 27 August. Another witness, Parkash, the proprietor of hotel in Fatehpur said that he had given the two a room from 16 August to 23 August. Anil Kumar Gupta, who worked in a guest house near Gali Telian in Delhi, said he had given them a room from 31 August to 2 September. Susheel Kumar, a parking attendant, had charged them for parking at Buddha Jayanti Park. He had noticed a boy and girl in the rear. Avdesh Singh Sharma, a physician from Agra, said he had removed Billa's stitches on 4 September, but Billa had left without paying him. Verdict and sentence It was established by the court that the duo had come to Delhi to escape the Bombay police. They arrived in Delhi on 16 August. They lived in various places under false names. They had two ceremonial kirpans, one small and a large, and gotten them sharpened elsewhere. Billa was proficient in stealing cars and had gotten fake number plates painted. He had stolen a Fiat from outside the Ashoka Hotel. They rented a room in Majlis Park, and paid for two months in advance. They picked the children sometime between 6:30 and 6:40 pm. The boy received a wound on his shoulder. At 7:30 pm, the car was parked near the Buddha Jayanti Park. Ranga bought two ice cream and three Campa Colas. The boy's autopsy established that he had eaten milk product before death. At 9:30 pm, the children were murdered in the woods near the Upper Ridge Road, Delhi. The girl's body was found with her undergarments missing. On 30 August, Ranga abandoned the car in Majlis Park, a few streets away from where they were living. On 31 August, after the police found the car, the duo left even though they had paid two months in advance. =Events as established from confessions= Although, the confessions were considered in the sentencing, they were noted to have certain relevant details. According to Ranga's retracted statement, Ranga was initially a truck driver and later a taxi driver. He was introduced to Billa by one Sham Singh in Bombay. The two had kidnapped a kid in Bombay using Ranga's taxi. Ranga had later released the kid after keeping him at his house for some time. Sham told him Billa was a well- known criminal who had killed two Arab men. Soon afterwards, Sham was arrested. The duo feared that Sham would reveal their ties to the police. They fled to Surat in the car, with another person. There they left the car and took a bus to Ahmedabad. They then took a train to Delhi. On 17 August, they stole a car but abandoned it because it was not in good condition. On 18 August, Ranga went to Panipat to meet his sister for Raksha Bandhan. On 19 August, they stole another car and changed its plates but abandoned it after finding it had bad acceleration. On the day, stole the car used in the crime from Ashoka Hotel and changed its plates. On 23 August, Billa threatened to kill Jugal and another person Kewal. On 24 August, they rented the house in Majlis Park. They decided that they would kidnap a couple the next day, then force them to take them to their house and rob it, but they found no victims while roaming in their car. On 26 August, after roaming all day, they found the siblings and thought them to be from a rich family. They offered them a lift and children accepted. The children were talking in English. Billa had already loosened the inner door handles; he then pulled them out. The children began quarreling with Billa, who then tried to frighten them with the small kirpan. The boy tried to snatch the kirpan but was injured. The victims in the struggle managed to stall the car. At one point, Ranga saw a Sikh man following them. He suggested dropping the kids off and fleeing. Billa refused. They then parked the car in Buddha Jayanti Park. The boy asked for water and was offered cola. He refused but accepted the ice cream on the girl's suggestion. The boy was bought another ice cream. They changed the car number to DHI 280. The children were asked about their parents. They replied their father was a naval officer. Ranga suggested the kids should be left off, as the father probably did not have much money and might try to fight them. Billa told the children that the girl would be used in a robbery in which she would stop a jeweler's car, coming from Palam airport, asking for a lift. After that they would be let go. They drove onto an untarred road and then took the boy about 100 yards away from the vehicle. Ranga was forced by Billa to attack the boy with longer kirpan, about 3 feet long. After one blow Ranga was unable to continue. Billa snatched the kirpan and repeatedly struck the boy. The boy died. While Ranga cleaned the blade, Billa raped the girl. Then Ranga was asked to rape the girl by Billa, which he complied with. When the girl was being raped again, she picked the kirpan and struck Billa's head. The girl ran toward the road, but Ranga caught her. They made her dress up and told her they were taking her back to her brother nearby. While she was walking ahead, Billa attacked her from behind and killed her. They washed the car to remove most of the blood. On 28 August, Billa left for Bombay by train. On 30 August, Ranga found that some personnel of Bombay police were in Delhi. He changed plates and parked the car a few lanes away from his rented place. On 31 August, he saw the police had found the car. Billa returned the same day. They left for Agra on 31 August. Billa's version of the events varied slightly. According to him, they had given the boy Mandrax tablets to dull his pain from the cuts he received in the scuffle. Billa claimed that the rape of the girl was Ranga's idea. They drove to a deserted place. Ranga took the boy away and Billa raped the girl. Ranga returned alone and raped her. The girl asked about her brother and got suspicious. She attacked Billa with the sword. Ranga snatched the sword away and killed her. Ranga then told Billa he had killed the boy. They then dumped the girl in the bushes and drove away. =Sentencing= Kuljeet Singh (alias Ranga Kush) and Jasbir Singh (alias Billa) were convicted and sentenced to death under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 34 (common intention), by an additional sessions judge in Delhi. They were also convicted for crimes under Section 363 (kidnapping), 365 (kidnapping with unlawful confinement), 366 (kidnapping a woman with intention of sexual intercourse) and 367 (kidnapping with intention to cause hurt), read with Section 34. Appeals The convicted challenged the death sentence verdict in the Delhi High Court. The High Court upheld the judgement on 16 November 1979. The convicts then petition under Article 136 in the Supreme Court of India, which was turned down. They then petitioned the president of India to use the clemency powers vested in him under Article 72 of the Constitution. The president turned down the petition without citing reason. They then petitioned the Supreme Court again arguing that the president should use his clemency powers fairly. On 21 April 1981, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentences. These petitions had further delayed their death sentences. The trials took about four years to complete. Death row interviews and execution Following the judgement, some journalists petitioned the Tihar jail that they be allowed to interview the death row convicts. The jail authorities rejected the petition on the grounds that their Jail Manual allowed interviews only with relatives, friends and legal advisers. Journalist Prabha Dutt decided to challenge the rejection of interview requests in court. On 7 November 1981, the Supreme Court of India decided that the convicts should be allowed to be interviewed by some journalists, if they were willing. The journalists were granted permission to interview them together, for an hour, and to submit to search before entering the prison. The judgement is considered a landmark in Indian law. On 30 January 1982, five reporters ‚Äî among them Prabha Dutt of Hindustan Times, Prakash Patra of The National Herald, and Usha Rai of The Times of India ‚Äî were allowed to conduct the interview. The convict interviewed was Jasbir Singh alias Billa, who insisted that he was innocent. Ranga refused to be interviewed. Both were hanged on 31 January 1982. Billa was quiet, but Ranga resisted going to the gallows. Their bodies were not claimed by their relatives. Aftermath The Kirti Chakra was awarded to the children on 5 April 1981. In 1978, the Indian Council for Child Welfare instituted two bravery awards for children under the age of 16, the Sanjay Chopra Award and the Geeta Chopra Award, given each year along with the National Bravery Award.

One begins to lose the thread in the second half, however, when the old man and his wife are cast adrift on a symbolic voyage to Cythera, birthplace of Aphrodite\\". Other critics have praised the film. In the fifth edition of The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, David Thomson wrote that the \\"beauty of the film has seldom been equaled\\". In an article for the British Film Institute, Christina Newland included Voyage to Cythera in her list of 10 great Greek films. Matthew Thrift also lauded the trilogy of which the film is a part, writing that all three films \\"see Angelopoulos at the height of his creative powers\\". In the book A History of Greek Cinema, Vrasidas Karalis referred to Voyage to Cythera as one of the best films of its decade.

It is at the head of the Bay of Fundy, just outside the small community of Harvey and approximately south of Moncton. Designated a Ramsar wetland of international importance on May 24, 1982, it is also part of the Fundy biosphere reserve established in 2007, which also contains the Shepody Bay wetland. It was also the first Canadian site in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve, as part of the Bay of Fundy Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve. It is within the Shepody Bay National Wildlife Area, which is administered by the Canadian Wildlife Service. Mary's Point is an important staging area for shorebirds migrating from the Canadian subarctic to South America during the fall, supporting up to two million semipalmated sandpipers annually, or nearly 75% of the global population of this species, as well as millions of birds of other species. Approximately of the intertidal mudflats are under jurisdiction to the province of New Brunswick. Another are owned by the Government of Canada, including the \\"most critical sites used by the large roosting flocks of shorebirds during high tide\\". The remaining portion, covering most of the salt marsh, is privately owned. The federal government has attempted to purchase the land, but has been spurned. Geography This open peninsula ranges in elevation from below sea level to above sea level, protruding into Shepody Bay. It is characterized by extensive intertidal mudflats, with gravel beaches bordering terrestrial habitats and shallow marine areas. In 1979, Ducks Unlimited Canada established a waterfowl impoundment adjacent to the salt marsh. Fauna This site exhibits \\"the world's highest known density of the crustaceans Corophium volutator\\", up to 60,000 per square metre during their reproductive cycle, which supports large populations of migratory shorebirds. During August, up to two million semipalmated sandpipers may use Mary's Point as a staging area, and as many as 200,000 may be present at any time during migration. These double their weight to before continuing their migration by flying to the North Atlantic, which winds carry them to the northern coast of South America in two to four days. Thousands of birds of other species also use Mary's Point as a staging area, including the black-bellied plover, least sandpiper, white-rumped sandpiper, short-billed dowitcher, semipalmated plover, red knot, sanderling and dunlin. Also, small populations of American black duck, ring-necked duck and blue-winged teal breed at the impoundment established by Ducks Unlimited. History The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia was built of Mary's Point sandstone.Mary's Point was a sandstone quarry which in the nineteenth century produced brownish-grey and brownish-red dimension stone (termed Mary's Point Grey and Mary's Point Red, respectively.) used throughout eastern North America as far away as Philadelphia and New York (the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park is an example using Mary's Point stone). The Mary's Point quarry yielded about 4,000 tons of stone annually, valued for its durability and workability. Geologically, the bedrock is a continuation of Grindstone Island, situated nearby to the east in Shepody Bay.Martin, Gwen, For Love of Stone: Volume 1, Province of new Brunswick, Department of Natural Resources and Energy, 1990 An important associate of the quarry, at one time called the Albert Freestone Company, was George Lang, a builder responsible for several notable Halifax structures using Mary's Point stone. The quarry was opened for the last time in 1987 to provide stone used in the restoration of the former Dominion Building in Halifax, now the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia.Description of the quarry, Government of Nova Scotia In Halifax St. Mary's stone was also used on the Welsford-Parker Monument (1857), the Halifax Court House (1858-63), and The Halifax Club (1862).

It is the fifth game in The Legendary Starfy video game series. On June 8, 2009, the game became the first in the series to be released outside Japan. Plot After the events of Densetsu no Stafy 4, the game's protagonist, Starfy, was sleeping in bed. Suddenly, a rabbit wearing an astronaut suit, named Bunston, fell from the sky through the roof of Pufftop Palace, landing on and waking Starfy. While Starfy was dazed, a group of pirates known as the Terrible Trio (made up of Snips, Ronk, and Papes) arrived and attempted to kidnap Bunston. Starfy came to, and defeated the Terrible Trio, giving Bunston an opportunity to escape. After Starfy knocked them out, they realized Bunston was no longer there, and left the palace to search for him. Starfy grabs his friend Moe, and the duo followed Bunston into the ocean. After meeting up with Bunston, they discover he's lost his memory, and that he recalls fragments of it when he touches certain crystal shards. The trio begin collecting them to restore Bunston's memories. Halfway through their adventure, the Terrible Trio finds them once again, and Starfy must fight them off several times. Over the course of the game, it's revealed that Bunston is a prince of another planet, and fled when it was attacked. The Terrible Trio serve whoever attacked his home. However, the Trio has a change of heart after being treated kindly by Starfy and crew, and apologize for what they've done. Mashtooth, revealed as the leader of the pirates who attacked Bunston's home, suddenly makes himself known, and gravely injures the Terrible Trio for their failure to capture Bunston. Starfy and crew return to Bunston's home to free it from Mashtooth, who wants to take over the galaxy. Mashtooth nearly proves too powerful for them, but thanks to a last second save from the Terrible Trio, nearly costing them their lives, Starfy is able to defeat Mashtooth, saving Bunston and his planet. Starfy and Moe return home. Gameplay Returning from the previous four Starfy titles are costumes that offer special abilities, including ghost, dragon, chicken, and an ice-tailed seal costume. Unlike other games in the series, instead of touching a costume, Starfy touches Bunston's thought bubbles to put on a costume. The game also has DS wireless co-op play in select areas and boss fights, where one person controls Starfy and the other controls Starly. Only one cartridge copy of the game is required for this feature. Five different minigames are offered, one of them a cooking game starring Starly. Returning from earlier entries in the series is the wardrobe collection in which players dress Starfy and Starly in different outfits. Development The Legendary Starfy is the first game in the series to be released outside Japan. Nintendo of America previously found games in the series to be \\"too Japanese\\" for a North American release. The joint decision by Nintendo and Tose to finally release the Starfy series abroad came about because the Nintendo DS was doing well in the market. Yurie Hattori, assistant director for the Starfy series states \\"It's a game that's really the result of all the great ideas we had in [Densetsu no Stafy] 1-4. This is a really accessible game and a great starting point to bring it to the US.\\" Very few changes were made for the game's English adaptation. To promote the game, a launch event was held at the Nintendo World Store in New York City on July 11, 2009. Reception Reviews The Legendary Starfy has received generally positive reviews. Reviews have commented on the game's similarities to Kirby. Reviewers have applauded the size and depth of the world, and creative story telling presented to the player. IGN Nintendo Team editor Mark Bozon expressed in his review that the game contains an \\"incredible amount\\" of activities, and can feel almost cluttered at times because of this. Game Informers Matt Helgeson said in his review of the game, \\"[it] isn't mind- blowing, but it's certainly well crafted and bolstered by some genuinely funny writing.\\" Both of the Game Informer staff who reviewed the game also found that the cooldown (character's dizziness) after performing Starfy's spin attack too many times was \\"annoying\\". Sales The Legendary Starfy debuted on the Japanese sales charts at number 3, selling 29,000 copies. It is the slowest debut for the series so far. Media Create sales data lists the game at having sold 126,428 copies in Japan by the end of 2008. Public sales information from Amazon.com suggests that The Legendary Starfy was the top- selling Nintendo DS game in North America during its week of release, temporarily beating out previous top-sellers on the platform such as Mario Kart DS and New Super Mario Bros. NPD Group reports that the game was the 19th best-selling game in North America during the months of June and July 2009.

Plot  The plot revolves around a fictitious Onion television news anchorman, Norm Archer (Len Cariou), who is forced to face the inevitability of a corporate takeover by the Onion's perennial fictitious multinational, Global Tetrahedron. Onion news is described as \\"fair and balanced\\" in the context of the film. The plot serves as a springboard for various comedy sketches featuring The Onion's satirical humor. Vignettes include parodies of music videos reminiscent of Britney Spears' work, and Steven Seagal appearing as a parody of the type of action hero he normally portrays. The film is interrupted (fictitiously) by film reviewers and commentators weighing in on the progress of the film, with one commentator preparing to stage an immediate walkout of all African American audience members unless a positive portrayal of an African American is inserted into the film.

After delays and previews to test audiences, the film was shelved and eventually dropped by Fox. New Regency Productions continued on with the project. In a March 15, 2007 interview, Scott Aukerman said that the Onion movie was at a \\"dead standstill\\". Additionally, Onion, Inc.

The examination is generally organized by government examination agencies which are under the authority of the responsible ministry. These agencies create examination commissions which consist of members of the examination agency, university professors and/or representatives from the professions. The Staatsexamina are both legally equivalent to a master's degree in the respective operating ranges. Overview Graduating is separated into two independent sequences: the first and the second . Students usually study at university for 4‚Äì8 years before they participate at final examinations to graduate by the first . This shows the academic qualification and knowledge on theoretical and practical skills. Afterwards teachers and jurists continue to the practical phase of two to three years in their future jobs ending with an examination sequence in order to graduate by the second , which amongst others tests their professional skills in their respective jobs. In law, the first Staatsexamen (Erste juristische Pr√ºfung, or first legal exam) since 2003 consists of two parts: The first part (the Schwerpunktbereich, i.e. elective subject) is taken at the university level under the authority of the respective universities and at their discretion. The second part is taken at the Oberlandesgerichte (Higher State Courts). The latter are often also the responsible authorities providing the administrative infrastructure during the Referendariat and in the end holding the exams of the second Staatsexamen. Only a lawyer possessing both Staatsexamina is a fully qualified lawyer (Volljurist or Assessor) and hence entitled to appear in court whether as judge, prosecutor, attorney (assumed representation is mandatory) or as an agent for the government. In medicine, the (√Ñrztliche Pr√ºfung, or physician exam) consists of three parts as of 2013. The first part is taken after the first two years of the six-year medical degree, i.e., after the basic sciences part of the degree (somewhat similar to U.S. pre-med) whereas the second part is taken after the fifth year of studies. Following a practical year, the third part follows at the end of the six-year medical degree. In pharmacy, the (Pharmazeutische Pr√ºfung, or pharmaceutical exam) consists of three parts. The first part is taken after the first two years of the four-year pharmacy degree, the second part at the end of the four-year pharmacy degree, and the third part after the so-called Praktisches Jahr (practical year) that prospective pharmacists have to take after graduation. In some cases, the second can be a substitute for a doctorate when it comes to applying for certain jobs at a university (i.e., Akademischer Rat).

Patristic period (about A.D. 100‚Äì800) The Fathers of the Church are honoured by the Church as her principal theologians. Tertullian (b. about 160) died a Montanist, and Origen (d. 254) showed a marked leaning towards Hellenism. Some of the Fathers, e.g. St. Cyprian (d. 258) and Gregory of Nyssa, were unorthodox on individual points; the former in regard to the baptism of heretics, the latter in the matter of apocatastasis. It was not so much in the catechetical schools of Alexandria, Antioch, and Edessa as in the struggle with the great heresies of the age that patristic theology developed. This serves to explain the character of the patristic literature, which is apologetical and polemical, parenetical and ascetic, with a wealth of exegetical wisdom on every page; for the roots of theology are in the Bible, especially in the Gospels and in the Epistles of St. Paul. It was not the intention of the Fathers to give a systematic treatment of theology; M√∂hler called attention to the variety found in their writings: the apologetic style is represented by the letter of Diognetus and the letters of St. Ignatius; the dogmatic in pseudo-Barnabas; the moral, in the Pastor of Hermas; canon law, in the letter of Clement of Rome; church history, in the Acts of the martyrdom of Polycarp and Ignatius. After the recovery of lost manuscripts may be added: the liturgical style, in the Didache; the catechetical, in the Proof of the Apostolic Preaching by Iren√¶us. Although the different epochs of the patristic age overlap each other, it may be said in general that the apologetic style predominated in the first epoch up to Constantine the Great, while in the second epoch, that is to say up to the time of Charlemagne. Christian writers against paganism and Judaism, had to explain the truths of natural religion, such as God, the soul, creation, immortality, and freedom of the will; at the same time they had to defend the chief mysteries of the Christian faith, as the Trinity, Incarnation, etc., and had to prove their sublimity, beauty, and conformity to reason. The list of those against pagan polytheism is long: Justin, Athenagoras, Tatian, Theophilus of Antioch, Hermias, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Cyprian, Minucius Felix, Commodianus, Arnobius, Lactantius, Prudentius, Firmicius Maternus, Eusebius of C√¶sarea, Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cyril of Alexandria, Nilus, Theodoret, Orosius, and Augustine of Hippo. The most prominent writers against Judaism were: Justin, Tertullian, Hippolytus of Rome, Cyprian, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Epiphanius of Salamis, Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, Isidore of Seville, with attacks on Jews who refused to recognize the prophetic Christian interpretation of the Old Testament. The efforts of the Fathers to define and combat heresy brought writings against Gnosticism, Manich√¶ism, and Priscillianism, with the focus on principles of faith and the Church's authority. In the struggles against Monarchianism, Sabellianism, and Arianism the emphasis was on the true meaning of the dogma of the Trinity. When the contest with Eunomianism broke out, theological and philosophical criticism turned to the doctrine of God and our knowledge of Him. The Christological disputes began with the rise of Apollinarianism, reached their climax in Nestorianism, Monophysitism, and Monothelitism, and were revived once more in Adoptionism. In this long and bitter strife, the doctrine of Christ's person, of the Incarnation, and Redemption, and in connection with that Mariology also, was placed on an orthodox foundation. Eastern Christian in this dispute on the Trinity and Christology included: the Alexandrines, Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind; Athanasius and the three Cappadocians, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa; Cyril of Alexandria and Leontius of Byzantium; finally, Maximus the Confessor and John Damascene. In the West the leaders were: Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilary of Poitiers, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, Fulgentius of Ruspe, Pope Leo I and Pope Gregory I. As the contest with Pelagianism and Semi-pelagianism clarified the dogmas of grace and liberty, providence and predestination, original sin and the condition of our first parents in Paradise, so also the contests with the Donatists brought codification to the doctrine of the sacraments (baptism), the hierarchical constitution of the Church her magisterium or teaching authority, and her infallibility. Augustine here was the leader, and next to him came Optatus of Mileve and disciples. A culminating contest was decided by the Second Council of Nic√¶a (787); it was in this struggle that, under the leadership of John Damascene, the communion of saints, the invocation of the saints, the veneration of relics and holy images were placed on a basis of orthodoxy. These developments left the dogmatic teachings of the Fathers as a collection of monographs rather than a systematic exposition. Iren√¶usAdversus haereses, III‚ÄìV. shows attempts at synthesis; the trilogy of Clement of Alexandria (d. 217) marks an advance in the same direction; but the most successful effort in Christian antiquity to systematize the principal dogmas of faith was made by Origen in his work De principiis, which is unorthodox. Gregory of Nyssa (d. 394) then endeavoured in his \\"Large Catechetical Treatise\\" (logos katechetikos ho megas) to correlate in a broad synthetic view the fundamental dogmas of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Sacraments. In the same manner, though somewhat fragmentarily, Hilary (d. 366) developed in his work \\"De Trinitate\\" the principal truths of Christianity. The catechetical instructions of Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386) especially his five mystagogical treatises, on the Apostles' Creed and the three sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist, contain an almost complete dogmatic treatise, Epiphanius (d. 496), in his two works Ancoratus and Panarium, aimed at a complete dogmatic treatise, and Ambrose (d. 397) in his chief works: \\"De fide\\", \\"De Spiritu S.\\", \\"De incarnatione\\", \\"De mysteriis\\", \\"De poenitentia\\", treated the main points of dogma in classic Latinity, though without any attempt at a unifying synthesis. In regard to the Trinity and Christology, Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444) was a model for later dogmatic theologians. Augustine of Hippo (d. 430) wrote one or two works, as the \\"De fide et symbolo\\" and the \\"Enchiridium\\", which are compendia of dogmatic and moral theology, as well as his speculative work De Trinitate. His disciple Fulgentius of Ruspe (d. 533) wrote an extensive and thorough confession of faith under the title, \\"De fide ad Petrum, seu regula rect√¶ fidei\\". Towards the end of the Patristic Age Isidore of Seville (d. 636) in the West and John Damascene (b. ab. 700) in the East paved the way for a systematic treatment of dogmatic theology. Following closely the teachings of Augustine and Gregory the Great, Isidore proposed to collect all the writings of the earlier Fathers and to hand them down as a precious inheritance to posterity. The results of this undertaking were the \\"Libri III sententiarum seu de summo bono\\". Tajus of Saragossa (650) had the same end in view in his \\"Libri V sententiarum\\". The work of John Damascene (d. after 754) not only gathered the teachings and views of the Greek Fathers, but reduced them to a systematic whole; he deserves to be called the first and the only scholastic among the Greeks. His main work, which is divided into three parts, is entitled: \\"Fons scienti√¶\\" (pege gnoseos), because it was intended to be the source, not merely of theology, but of philosophy and Church history as well. The third or theological part, known as \\"Expositio fidei orthodox√¶\\" (), is a combination of positive and scholastic theology, and aims at thoroughness. After John Damascene, Greek theology went through the Photian schism (869). The only Greek prior to him who had produced a complete system of theology was Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, in the fifth century; but he was more popular in the West, at least from the eighth century on, than in the East. Although he openly wove into the Catholic system neo-Platonic thoughts and phrases, nevertheless he enjoyed an unparalleled reputation among the scholastics of the Middle Ages. For all that, Scholasticism did not take its guidance from John Damascene or Pseudo-Dionysius, but from Augustine. Augustinian thought runs through the whole progress of Western Catholic philosophy and theology. The Venerable Bede (d. 735), a contemporary of John Damascene, had solid education in theology, and extensive knowledge of the Bible and of the Fathers of the Church. He is the link which joins the patristic with the medieval history of theology. Middle Ages (800‚Äì1500) The beginnings of Scholasticism may be traced back to the days of Charlemagne (d. 814). Thence it progressed in ever-guickening development to the time of Anselm of Canterbury, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Peter the Lombard, and onward to its full growth in the Middle Ages (first epoch, 800‚Äì1200). The most brilliant period of Scholasticism embraces about 100 years (second epoch, 1200‚Äì1300), and with it are connected the names of Alexander of Hales, Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, and Duns Scotus. From the beginning of the fourteenth century, owing to the predominance of Nominalism and to the sad condition of the Church, Scholasticism began to decline (third epoch, 1300‚Äì1500). First epoch: beginning and progress of Scholasticism (800‚Äì1200) In the first half of this epoch, up to the time of Anselm of Canterbury, the theologians were more concerned with preserving than with developing the writings of the Fathers. Theology was cultivated nowhere with greater industry than in the cathedral and monastic schools, founded and fostered by Charlemagne. The earliest signs of a new thought appeared in the ninth century during the discussions relative to the Last Supper (Paschasius Radbertus, Ratramnus, Rabanus Maurus). These speculations were carried to a greater depth in the second Eucharistic controversy against Berengarius of Tours (d. 1088), (Lanfranc, Guitmund, Alger, Hugh of Langres, etc.). The only systematic theologian of this time, Scotus Eriugena (d. after 870), was an avowed pantheist. Anselm of Canterbury (d. 1109) was the first to bring a sharp logic to bear upon the principal dogmas of Christianity, and to draw up a plan for dogmatic theology. Taking the substance of his doctrine from Augustine, Anselm, as a philosopher, was not so much a disciple of Aristotle as of Plato, in whose dialogues he had been schooled. Another pillar of the Church was Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153), the \\"Father of Mysticism\\". Though for the most part the author of ascetic works with a mystical tendency, he used the weapons of scientific theology against Abelard's Rationalism and the Realism of Gilbert de La Porr√©e. It is upon the doctrine of Anselm and Bernard that the Scholastics of succeeding generations took their stand, and it was their spirit which lived in the theological efforts of the University of Paris. Less prominent, yet noteworthy, are: Ruprecht of Deutz, William of Thierry, Gaufridus, and others. The first attempts at a theological system may be seen in the so-called Books of Sentences, collections and interpretations of quotations from the Fathers, more especially of Augustine. One of the earliest of these books is the Summa sententiarum, an anonymous compilation created at the School of Loan some time after 1125. Another is The Sacraments of the Christian Faith written by Hugh of St. Victor around 1135. His works are characterized throughout by a close adherence to Augustine and, according to the verdict of Scheeben, may serve as guides for beginners in the theology of Augustine. The similar work of Robert Pulleyn (d. 1146) is careless in arranging the matter and confuses the various questions of which he treats. Peter the Lombard, called the \\"Magister Sententiarum\\" (d. 1164), on the other hand, stands above them all. What Gratian had done for canon law the Lombard did for dogmatic and moral theology. He sifted and explained and paraphrased the patristic lore in his \\"Libri IV sententiarum\\", and the arrangement which he adopted was, in spite of the lacun√¶, so excellent that up to the sixteenth century his work was the standard text-book of theology. The work of interpreting this text began in the thirteenth century, and there was no theologian of note in the Middle Ages who did not write a commentary on the Sentences of the Lombard. Hundreds of these commentaries are still unprinted; no other work exerted such a powerful influence on the development of scholastic theology. Neither the analogous work of his disciple, Peter of Poitiers (d. 1205), nor the important \\"Summa aurea\\" of William of Auxerre (d. after 1230) superseded the Lombard's \\"Sentences\\" Along with Alain of Lille (d, 1203), William of Auvergne (d. 1248), who died as bishop of Paris, deserves special mention. Though preferring the free, unscholastic method of an earlier age, he yet shows himself at once an original philosopher and a profound theologian. Inasmuch as in his numerous monographs on the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Sacraments, etc., he took into account the anti-Christian attacks of the Arabic writers on Aristoteleanism, he is the connecting link between this age and the thirteenth century. Second epoch: Scholasticism at its zenith (1200‚Äì1300) This period of Scholasticism was marked by the appearance of the theological Summae, as well as the mendicant orders. In the thirteenth century the champions of Scholasticism were to be found in the Franciscans and Dominicans, beside whom worked also the Augustinians, Carmelites, and Servites. Alexander of Hales (d. about 1245) was a Franciscan, while Albert the Great (d. 1280) was a Dominican. The Summa theologi√¶ of Alexander of Hales is the largest and most comprehensive work of its kind, flavoured with Platonism. Albert was an intellectual working not only in matters philosophical and theological but in the natural sciences as well. He made a first attempt to present the entire philosophy of Aristotle and to place it at the service of Catholic theology. The logic of Aristotle had been rendered into Latin by Boethius and had been used in the schools since the end of the sixth century; but his physics and metaphysics were made known to Western Christendom only through the Arabic philosophers of the thirteenth century. His works were prohibited by the Synod of Paris, in 1210, and again by a Bull of Pope Gregory IX in 1231. But after the Scholastics, led by Albert the Great, had gone over the faulty Latin translation once more, and had reconstructed the doctrine of Aristotle and its principles. Bonaventure (d. 1274) and Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), mark the highest development of Scholastic theology. St. Bonaventure follows Alexander of Hales, his fellow-religious and predecessor, but surpasses him in mysticism and clearness of diction. Unlike the other Scholastics of this period, he did not write a theological Summa, but a Commentary on the Sentences, as well as his Breviloquium, a condensed Summa. Alexander of Hales and Bonaventure represent the old Franciscan Schools, from which the later School of Duns Scotus essentially differed. Thomas Aquinas holds the same rank among the theologians as does Augustine among the Fathers of the Church. He is distinguished by wealth of ideas, systematic exposition of them, and versatility. For dogmatic theology his most important work is the Summa theologica. Pope Leo XIII in his Encyclical \\"√Üterni Patris\\" (1879) restored the study of the Scholastics, especially of St. Thomas, in all higher Catholic schools, a measure which was again emphasized by Pope Pius X. Richard of Middleton (d. 1300) is a classical representative of the Franciscan School. Among the Servites, Henry of Ghent (d. 1293), a disciple of Albert the Great, deserves mention; his style is original and rhetorical, his judgments are independent, his treatment of the doctrine on God attests the profound thinker. Thomas's pupil Peter of Tarentaise became Pope Innocent V. (d. 1276). Ulric of Strasburg (d. 1277) islittle known, though his unprinted Summa was held in high esteem in the Middle Ages. √Ügidius of Rome (d. 1316) differed in detail from the teaching of Aquinas. But the attempt of the Augustinian Gavardus in the seventeenth century to create a distinctly \\"√Ügidian School\\" proved a failure. On the other hand, adversaries of Aquinas sprang up even in his lifetime. The first attack came from England and was led by William de la Mare, of Oxford (d. 1285). Duns Scotus (1266‚Äî1308) by bold and virulent criticism of the Thomistic system was to a great extent responsible for its decline. Scotus is the founder a new Scotistic School, in the speculative treatment of dogma. Where Aquinas likens the system of theology and philosophy to the animal organism, which the soul unifies, in Scotus's own words, on the other hand, the order of things is rather symbolized by the plant, the root shooting forth branches and twigs which have an innate tendency to grow away from the stem. Scotism won a s victory over Thomism by its doctrine concerning the Immaculate Conception. Later Franciscans, among them Constantine Sarnanus (Costanzo Torri) (1589) and John of Rada (Juan de Rada) (1599), set about minimizing or even reconciling the doctrinal differences of the two. Third epoch: gradual decline of Scholasticism (1300‚Äì1500) The following period showed both consolidation, and disruption: the Fraticelli, nominalism, conflict between Church and State (Philip the Fair, Louis of Bavaria, the Avignon Papacy). The spread of Nominalism owed much to two pupils of Duns Scotus: the Frenchman Peter Aureolus (d. 1321) and the Englishman William Occam (d. 1347). Marsilius of Padua and John of Jandun opposed the primacy of the pope. The principle \\"Concilium supra Papam\\" was important to the times of the Council of Constance and Council of Basel. Pierre d'Ailly (d. 1425) and Jean Gerson (d. 1429) embraced doctrines which they abandoned after the Western Schism was healed. Prominent later nominalists were the general of the Augustinians, Gregory of Rimini (d. 1359), and Gabriel Biel (d. 1495), who has been called the \\"last Scholastic\\". Nominalist subtleties, coupled with an austere Augustinism, made Gregory of Rimini the precursor of Baianism and Jansenism. Gabriel Biel praised Occam and commented on his writings. Nominalism had less effect on the Dominican theologians. With the possible exceptions of Durand of St. Pour√ßain (d. 1332) and Holkot (d. 1349), its members were as a rule loyal Thomists. Most prominent among them during the first half of the fourteenth century were: Herv√¶us de Nedellec (d. 1323), an opponent of Scotus; John of Paris (d. 1306); Peter of Palude (d. 1342); and especially Raynerius of Pisa (d. 1348), who wrote an alphabetical summary of the doctrine of Aquinas. A prominent figure in the fifteenth century is Antonine of Florence (d. 1459), a compiler and versatile author of a \\"Summa Theologi√¶\\". A powerful champion of Thomism was John Capreolus (d. 1444), the \\"Prince of Thomists\\" (princeps Thomistarum). In his adamantine \\"Clypeus Thomistarum\\", he repelled the adversaries of Thomism with the very words of Thomas. It was only in the early part of the sixteenth century that commentaries on the \\"Summa Theologica\\" of Aquinas began to appear, among the first to undertake this work being Cardinal Cajetan of Vio (d. 1537) and Konrad K√∂llin (d. 1536). The philosophical Summa contra Gentiles found a masterly commentator in Francis of Ferrara (d. 1528). The Franciscans partly favoured Nominalism, partly adhered to pure Scotism. Among the latter group were: Francis Mayronis (d. 1327); John of Colonia; Peter of Aquila (d. about 1370), who as abbreviator of Scotus was called Scotellus (little Scotus); Nicolaus de Orbellis (ca. 1460), and Franciscus Lichetus (d. 1520), a famous commentator of Scotus. William of Vorrilong (about 1400), Stephen Brulefer (d. 1485), and Nicholas of Niise (Nicolaus Denyse) (d. 1509) belong to a third class which is characterized by the tendency to closer contact with Bonaventure. Splits are discernible in the schools of the other orders. While the Augustinians James of Viterbo (d. 1308) and Thomas of Strasburg (d. 1357) attached themselves to √Ügidius of Rome, Gregory of Rimini, mentioned above, championed an undisguised nominalism. Alphonsus Vargas of Toledo (d. 1366), on the other hand, was an advocate of Thomism in its strictest form. Among the Carmelites, also, divergencies of doctrine appeared. Gerard of Bologna (d. 1317) was a staunch Thomist, while John Baconthorp (d. 1346) delighted in trifling controversies against the Thomists, and endeavoured to found a new school in his order. Generally speaking, however, the later Carmelites were followers of Aquinas. The Order of the Carthusians produced in the fifteenth century a prominent and many-sided theologian in the person of Dionysius Ryckel (d. 1471), surnamed \\"the Carthusian\\", a descendant of the Leevis family, who set up his chair in Roermond, (the Netherlands). From his pen we possess commentaries on the Bible, Pseudo-Dionysius, Peter the Lombard, and Aquinas. He was equally conversant with mysticism and scholasticism. Albert the Great, Henry of Ghent, and Dionysius are representative of German theology of the Middle Ages. The anonymous German Theology, edited by Martin Luther, is distinct from the German Theology of bishop Berthold of Chiemsee (d. 1543). Outside the religious orders were many other. The Englishman Thomas Bradwardine (d. 1340), was the foremost mathematician of his day and Archbishop of Canterbury. His sombre work De causa Dei contra Pelagianos was later used by Calvinist Anglicans. Richard Radulphus, Bishop of Armagh (d. 1360), in his controversy with the Armenians, paved the way for Wyclif. (The Carmelite Thomas Netter (d. 1430), surnamed Waldensis, stands out as a controversialist against the Wyclifites and Hussites.) Nicholas of Cusa (d. 1404) inaugurated of a new and unorthodox speculative system in dogmatic theology. A thorough treatise on the Church was written by John Torquemada (d. 1468), and a similar work by St. John Capistran (d. 1456). Alphonsus Tostatus (d. 1454) was a scholar, the equal of Nicholas of Lyra (d. 1341) in Scriptural learning; he interspersed his Biblical commentaries on the Scriptures with dogmatic treatises. His work \\"Quinque paradoxa\\" is a treatise on Christology and Mariology. Modern times (1500‚Äì1900) The Protestant Reformation brought about a more accurate definition of important Catholic articles of faith. From the period of the Renaissance the revival of classical studies gave new vigour to exegesis and patrology, while the Reformation stimulated the universities which had remained Catholic, especially in Spain (Salamanca, Alcal√°, Coimbra) and in the Netherlands (Louvain), to intellectual research. Spain, which had fallen behind during the Middle Ages, now came boldly to the front. The Sorbonne of Paris regained its lost prestige only towards the end of the sixteenth century. Among the religious orders the newly founded Society of Jesus probably contributed most to the revival and growth of theology. Scheeben distinguishes five epochs in this period. First epoch: to the Council of Trent (1500‚Äì1570) It was only by a slow process that Catholic theology rose again. The whole literature of this period bears an apologetical and controversial character and deals with those subjects which had been attacked most bitterly: the rule and sources of faith, the Church, grace, the sacraments, especially the holy Eucharist. Numerous defenders of the Catholic faith were Germans: Johann Eck (d. 1543), Cochl√¶us (d. 1552), Staphylus (d. 1564), James of Hoogstraet (d. 1527), John Gropper (d. 1559), Albert Pighius (d. 1542), Cardinal Hosius (d. 1579), Martin Cromer (d. 1589), and Peter Canisius (d. 1597). The last-named gave to the Catholics not only his world- renowned catechism, but also a most valuable Mariology. In England John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester (d. 1535), and Thomas More (d. 1535) championed the cause of the Catholic faith with their pen. Cardinal Pole (d. 1568), Stephen Gardiner (d. 1555), and Cardinal William Allen (d. 1594) placed their learning at the service of the Catholic Church, while the Jesuit Nicholas Sanders wrote one of the best treatises on the Church. In Belgium the professors of the University of Louvain opened new paths for the study of theology, foremost among them were: Ruardus Tapper (d. 1559), John Driedo (d. 1535), Jodocus Ravesteyn (d. 1570), John Hessels (d. 1566), Johannes Molanus (d. 1585), and Garetius (d. 1571). To the last-named we owe an excellent treatise on the holy Eucharist. In France Jacques Merlin, Christopher Chefontaines (d. 1595), and Gilbert G√©nebrard (d. 1597) rendered great services to dogmatic theology. Sylvester Prierias (d. 1523), Ambrose Catharinus (d; 1553), and Cardinal Seripandus are the boast of Italy. But, above all other countries, Spain is distinguished: Alphonsus of Castro (d. 1558), Michael de Medina (d. 1578), Peter de Soto (d. 1563). Some of their works have remained classics, such as \\"De natura et gratia\\" (Venice 1547) of Dominic Soto; \\"De justificatione libri XV\\" (Venice, 1546) of Andrew Vega; \\"De locis theologicis\\" (Salamanca, 1563) of Melchior Cano. Second epoch: late Scholasticism at its height (1570‚Äì1660) After the close of the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), Catholic theology was an active field. =Controversial theology= Controversial theology was the speciality of Cardinal Bellarmine (d. 1621), who defended almost the whole of Catholic theology against the attacks of the Reformers. Other defenders were the Spanish Jesuit Gregory of Valencia (d. 1603) and his pupils Adam Tanner (d. 1632) and James Gretser (d. 1625), who taught in the University of Ingolstadt. Thomas Stapleton (d. 1608) wrote on the material and formal principle of Protestantism. Cardinal du Perron (d. 1618) of France entered the arena against James I of England and Philip Mornay, and wrote a treatise on the holy Eucharist. The pulpit orator Bossuet (d. 1627) attacked Protestantism from the standpoint of history. The Pr√¶scriptiones Catholicae was a voluminous work of the Italian Gravina (7 vols., Naples, 1619‚Äì39). Martin Becanus (Martin Verbeeck) (d. 1624), a Belgian Jesuit, published his handy Manuale controversiarum. In the Netherlands the defence of religion was carried on by the two learned brothers Adrian (d. 1669) and Peter de Walemburg (d. 1675), both auxiliary bishops of Cologne and controversialists, who easily ranked among the best. The Eastern Church was represented in the two Greek converts, Peter Arcudius (d. 1640) and Leo Allatius (d. 1669). =Positive theology= The development of positive theology went hand in hand with the progress of research into the Patristic Era and into the history of dogma. These studies were especially cultivated in France and Belgium. A number of scholars, thoroughly versed in history, published in monographs the results of their investigations into the history of particular dogmas. Joannes Morinus (d. 1659) made the Sacrament of Penance the subject of special study; Isaac Habert (d. 1668), the doctrine of the Greek Fathers on grace; Hallier (d. 1659), the Sacrament of Holy orders, Jean Garnier (d. 1681), Pelagianism; √âtienne Agard de Champs (d. 1701), Jansenism; Tricassinus (d. 1681), Augustine's doctrine on grace. Unorthodox voices were Baius, Jansenius the Younger, Launoy, de Marca, Dupin, and others. Pierre Nicole and Antoine Arnauld were Jansenists, who wrote a monumental work on the Eucharist, \\"Perp√©tuit√© de la foi\\" (Paris, 1669‚Äì74). The Jesuit Petavius (d. 1647) and the Oratorian Louis Thomassin (d. 1695), wrote \\"Dogmata theologica\\". They placed positive theology on a new basis without disregarding the speculative element. =Neo-scholasticism= Religious orders fostered scholastic theology. Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure were proclaimed Doctors of the Church, respectively by Pope Pius V and Pope Sixtus V. At the head of the Thomists was Domingo Ba√±ez (d. 1604), the first and greatest opponent of the Jesuit Luis Molina (d. 1600). He wrote a commentary on the theological Summa of Aquinas, which, combined with a similar work by Bartholomew Medina (d. 1581), forms a harmonious whole. Under the leadership of Ba√±ez a group of scholarly Dominicans took up the defence of the Thomistic doctrine on grace: Alvarez (d. 1635), Tomas de Lemos (d. 1629), Pedro de Ledesma (d. 1616), Antoine Massouli√© (d. 1706), Reginaldus (Antonin Reginald or Regnault) (d. 1676), John Paul Nazarius (d. 1646), John a St. Thoma (d. 1644), Xantes Mariales (d. 1660), Jean Baptiste Gonet (d. 1681), Antoine Goudin (d. 1695), Vincent Contenson (d. 1674), and others. The Carmelites of Salamanca produced the Cursus Salmanticensis (Salamanca, 1631‚Äì1712) in 15 folios, as commentary on the Summa (the names of the authors of this work are not known). Outside the Dominican Order, also, Thomism had supporters: the Benedictine Alphonsus Curiel (d. 1609), Francis Zumel (d. 1607), John Puteanus (d. 1623), and the Irishman Augustine Gibbon de Burgo (d. 1676), who laboured in Spain and at Erfurt in Germany. The Catholic universities were active in the interest of Thomism. At Louvain William Estius (d. 1613) wrote a Thomist commentary on the \\"Liber Sententiarum\\" of Peter the Lombard, while his colleagues Johannes Wiggers and Francis Sylvius (d. 1649) explained the theological Summa of the master himself. In the Sorbonne Thomism was represented by Gammach√© (d. 1625), Andrew Duval (d. 1637), and Nicholas Ysambert (d. 1624). The University of Salzburg also furnished the Theologia scholastica of Augustine Reding, who held the chair of theology in that university from 1645 to 1658, and died as Abbot of Einsiedeln in 1692. The Franciscans of this epoch maintained doctrinal opposition to the Thomists, with steadily continued Scotist commentaries on Peter the Lombard. Irish Franciscans who promoted theological activity: Mauritius Hibernicus (d. 1603), Anthony Hickay (Hiqu√¶us, d. 1641), Hugh Cavellus, and John Ponce (Pontius, d. 1660). The following Italians and Belgians also deserve to be mentioned: Francis de Herrera (about 1590), Angelus Vulpes (d. 1647), Philip Fabri (d. 1630), Bosco (d. 1684), and Cardinal Brancatus de Laurea (d. 1693). Scotistic manuals for use in schools were published about 1580 by Cardinal Sarnanus and by William Herincx, this latter acting under the direction of the Franciscans. The Capuchins, on the other hand, adhered to Bonaventure, as, e.g., Peter Trigos (d. 1593), Joseph Zamora (d. 1649), Gaudentius of Brescia, (d. 1672), Marcus a Baudunio (Marc de Bauduen) (d. 1673), and others. =Jesuit theologians= The Society of Jesus substantially adhered to the Summa of Thomas Aquinas, yet at the same time it made use of an eclectic freedom. Luis Molina (d. 1600) was the first Jesuit to write a commentary on the Summa of St. Thomas. He was followed by Cardinal Toletus (d. 1596) and by Gregory of Valencia (d. 1603), mentioned above as a controversialist. A leading Jesuit group are the Spaniards Francisco Su√°rez, Gabriel Vasquez, and Didacus Ruiz. Francisco Su√°rez (d. 1617), the most prominent among them, had the title \\"Doctor eximius\\", which Pope Benedict XIV gave him. In his colleague Gabriel Vasquez (d. 1604), Su√°rez found a good critic. Didacus Ruiz (d. 1632) wrote on God and the Trinity, subjects which were also thoroughly treated by Christopher Gilles (d. 1608). Harruabal (d. 1608), Ferdinand Bastida (d. about 1609), Valentine Herice belong to the history of Molinism. During the succeeding period James Granado (d. 1632), John Pr√¶positus (d. 1634), Caspar Hurtado (d. 1646), and Anthony Perez (d. 1694) wrote commentaries on Aquinas. Theological manuals were written by Arriaga (d. 1667), Martin Esparza (d. 1670), Francis Amicus (d. 1651), Martin Becanus (d. 1625), Adam Tanner (d. 1632), and finally by Sylvester Maurus (d. 1687), who is clear and a philosopher. Major monographs were: *against Baius and his followers, Mart√≠nez de Ripalda (d. 1648), work on the supernatural order; *Leonard Lessius (d. 1623), treatises on God and His attributes; *√Ügidius Coninck (d. 1633), on the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the sacraments; *Cardinal John de Lugo (d. 1660), a moralist, wrote on the virtue of faith and the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist; *Claude Tiphanus (d. 1641), on the notions of personality and hypostasis. Cardinal Pallavicini, (d. 1667), known as the historiographer of the Council of Trent, won repute as a dogmatic theologian by several of his writings. Third epoch: decline of Scholasticism (1660‚Äì1760) Other counter-currents of thought set in: Cartesianism in philosophy, Gallicanism, and Jansenism. Italy was least affected. Theology within the schools of the old religious orders was not unchanged; almost all the theological literature of this period and the revival of Scholasticism are due to them. A product of the Thomistic school, widely used, was the standard work of the Dominican Charles Ren√© Billuart (d. 1757), a skilled explanation and defence of the Thomistic system in scholastic form. The dogmatic theology of Vincent Louis Gotti was a rival. Other Thomists produced monographs: Drouin on the sacraments and Bernard de Rubeis (d. 1775) on original sin. More eclectic in their adherence to Thomism were Celestine Sfondrato (d. 1696) and Jos√© Saenz d'Aguirre (d. 1699); the latter's work \\"Theology of St. Anselm\\" is in three volumes. Among the Franciscans Claudius Frassen (d. 1680) issued his elegant Scotus academicus, a counterpart to the Thomistic theology of Billuart. Of the Scotistic School also were Gabriel Boyvin, Crescentius Krisper (d. 1721), and Dalmatius Kick (d. 1769). Eusebius Amort (d. 1775), the foremost theologian in Germany, combined conservatism with due regard for modern demands. Jesuits were still active: Edmond Simonet, Joannes de Ulloa (d. about 1723), and Marin were the authors of voluminous scholastic works. Textbooks of theology were written by Platel (d. 1681), Antoine (d. 1743), Pichler (d. 1736), Sardagna (d. 1775), Erber, Monschein (d. 1769), and Gener. The \\"Theologia Wirceburgensis\\" was published in 1766‚Äì71 by the Jesuits of W√ºrzburg. The new school of Augustinians, who based their theology on the system of Gregory of Rimini rather than on that of √Ügidius of Rome. Because of the stress they laid on the rigoristic element in Augustine's doctrine on grace, they were for a time suspected of Baianism and Jansenism; but were cleared of this suspicion by Pope Benedict XIV. To this school belonged the scholarly Lupus (d. 1681) at Louvain and Cardinal Noris (d. 1704). Its best work on dogmatic theology came from the pen of Giovanni Lorenzo Berti (d. 1766). His fellow-workers in the same field were Fulgentius Bellelli (d. 1742) and Joseph Bertieri. The French Oratory took up Jansenism, with Pasquier Quesnel, Lebrun, and Gaspard Juenin. The Sorbonne of Paris also adopted aspects of Jansenism and Gallicanism; leaders were Louis Habert (d. 1718), du Hamel (d. 1706), Nicolas L'Herminier, Charles Witasse (d. 1716). Exceptions were Louis Abelly (d. 1691) and Martin Grandin, who were papal loyalists, as was Honoratus Tourn√©ly (d. 1729), whose \\"Pr√¶lectiones dogmatic√¶\\" are numbered among the best theological text-books. Against Jansenism stood the Jesuits Dominic Viva (d. 1726), La Fontaine (d. 1728), Lorenzo Alticozzi (d. 1777), and Faure (d. 1779). Gallicanism and Josephinism were also pressed by the Jesuit theologians, especially by Francesco Antonio Zaccaria (d. 1795), Alfonso Muzzarelli (d. 1813), Bolgeni (d. 1811), Roncaglia, and others. The Jesuits were seconded by the Dominicans Giuseppe Agostino Orsi (d. 1761) and Thomas Maria Mamachi (d. 1792). Another champion in this struggle was Cardinal Gerdil (d. 1802). Alphonsus Liguori (d. 1787) wrote popular works. Fourth epoch: at a low ebb (1760‚Äì1840) In France the influences of Jansenism and Gallicanism were still powerful; in the German Empire Josephinism and Febronianism spread. The suppression of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV occurred in 1773. The period was dominated by the European Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and German idealism. De Lamennais (d. 1854) and Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg (1774‚Äì1860), were both unorthodox. There were standard manuals of Wiest (1791), Kl√ºpfel (1789), Marian Dobmayer (1807), and Brenner (1826). The ex- Jesuit Benedict Stattler (d. 1797) tried to apply to dogma the philosophy of Christian Wolff, Zimmer (1802), even that of Friedrich Schelling. Liebermann (d. 1844), who taught at Strasburg and Mainz, produced a more traditional dogmatic theology, but concealing his dislike for the Scholastics. It appeared in the years 1819‚Äì26 and went through many editions. Georg Hermes (d. 1831) of Bonn attempted to treat Catholic theology in a Kantian spirit, as did Anton G√ºnther (d. 1863) in Vienna, who sought to unravel the mysteries of Christianity by means of a modern Gnosis and to resolve them into purely natural truths. Fifth epoch: restoration of dogmatic theology (1840‚Äì1900) Harold Acton remarked on the large number of histories of dogma published in Germany published in the years 1838 to 1841. Joseph G√∂rres (d. 1848) and Ignaz von D√∂llinger (d. 1890) intended that Catholic theology should influence the development of German states. Johann Adam M√∂hler advanced patrology and symbolism. Both positive and speculative theology received a new lease of life, the former through Heinrich Klee (d. 1840), the latter through Franz Anton Staudenmaier (d. 1856). At the same time men like Joseph Kleutgen (d. 1883), Karl Werner (d. 1888), and Albert St√∂ckl (d. 1895) supported Scholasticism by thorough historical and systematic writings. In France and Belgium the dogmatic theology of Cardinal Gousset (d. 1866) of Reims and the writings of Jean-Baptiste Malou, Bishop of Bruges (d. 1865) exerted great influence. In North America there were the works of Francis Kenrick (d. 1863); Cardinal Camillo Mazzella (d. 1900) wrote his dogmatic works while occupying the chair of theology at Woodstock College, Maryland. In England Nicholas Wiseman (d. 1865), Cardinal Manning (d. 1892), and John Henry Newman (d. 1890) advanced Catholic theology. In Italy, Gaetano Sanseverino (d. 1865), Matteo Liberatore (d. 1892), and Salvator Tongiorgi (d. 1865) worked to restore Scholastic philosophy, against traditionalism and ontologism, which had a numerous following among Catholic scholars in Italy, France, and Belgium. The pioneer work in positive theology fell to the Jesuit Giovanni Perrone (d. 1876) in Rome. Other theologians, as Carlo Passaglia (d. 1887), Clement Schrader (d. 1875), Cardinal Franzelin (d. 1886), Domenico Palmieri (d. 1909), and others, continued his work. Among the Dominicans was Cardinal Zigliara, an inspiring teacher and fertile author. Germany, where Franz Xaver von Baader (d. 1841), G√ºnther, and Jakob Frohschammer (d. 1893) continued to teach unorthodox views, produced a number of prominent theologians, as Johannes von Kuhn (d. 1887), Anton Berlage (d. 1881), Franz Xaver Dieringer (d. 1876), Johann Heinrich Oswald (d. 1903), Albert Knoll (d. 1863), Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger (d. 1883), Constantine von Sch√§zler (d. 1880), Bernard Jungmann (d. 1895), Johann Baptist Heinrich (d. 1891), and others. Germany's leading orthodox theologian at this time was Joseph Scheeben (d. 1888). The First Vatican Council was held (1870), and the Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII on the value of Scholastic, especially Thomistic, philosophy and theology was issued (1879). Both these events were landmarks in the history of dogmatic theology.

He was the son of Reverend Dr. Alexander Macquisten, the minister of Inverkip Parish Church. Background Educated by his father, from whom he acquired an intimate knowledge of the Bible, he attended University of Glasgow and went on to practise as a solicitor. At the same time, he was elected a member of Glasgow Corporation. In 1909, he qualified as a member of the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland and ten years later was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn. He was made a King's Counsel (KC) in Scotland in 1919, and took silk at the English Bar in 1932. Politics Macquisten unsuccessfully contested the Leith Burghs parliamentary constituency in 1910, and then Glasgow St. Rollox in 1912 as a Unionist. In 1918, he was elected as the Conservative party Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Springburn. In 1921 he put forward a proposal to criminalize lesbianism which was rejected by the House of Lords; during the debate, Lord Birkenhead, the then Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain argued that 999 women out of a thousand had \\"never even heard a whisper of these practices.\\"House of Lords Debates, 15 August 1921, column 574. Macquisten held onto the Glasgow Springburn constituency until he was defeated in the general election of 1922. He then fought and won Argyllshire in 1924, holding it for the Scottish Conservative & Unionist Party until his death in 1940. In the House of Commons he was known for his wit. The humour which he often brought to his speeches often belied their serious content. He was though serious in his effort to abolish the compulsory Political Levy which Trade Union members paid before the passing of the Trade Disputes and Trade Union Act 1927. In 1925, he introduced a Private Member's Bill which was intended, in his own words, to \\"restore the individual freedom of the working man.\\" The second reading of the Bill elicited a speech on \\"Peace in Industry\\" from the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, a speech which made a great impression at the time. The Baldwin Government accepted the principle of the Bill, but moved an amendment on the basis that legislation on such an important question ought not to emanate from a private member, but from the Government itself. The Bill was eventually introduced following the general strike in 1926. He was the champion of private buses and a one-man shopkeeper. He also sang the praises of herring and porridge, and his unerring praise of the properties of Scotch whisky gave rise to a series of much celebrated verbal duals with the teetotal Lady Astor. When rationing was introduced, he was the first to suggest mass-production of macon, the mutton substitute for bacon, which originated from an old Scottish recipe. \\"If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Food will consult with any farmer's wife in Perthshire, she will show him how to cure it,\\" he informed the House of Commons. Macquisten died at his home at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey England, on 29 February 1940 aged 69. References Further reading *Duff Cooper. Old Men Forget, Carroll & Graf, 1988. pp. 142 and 144 *R. H.

All three of the caves are located in the Arikok National Park. The most prominent are Guadirikiri Cave, the Fontein Cave and the Huliba Cave. Nocturnal bats nestle in all these caves. The importance which the Government of Aruba attaches to these three caves is borne by the fact that postage stamps with images of them were issued by Post Aruba in April 2009 in specific denominations. The stamp of 175 cents value depicts the Baranca Sunu Cave, the stamp of 200 cents denomination depicts the Fontein Cave, and the stamp of 225 cents value shows the entrance of Quadirikiri Grot (Guadirikiri Cave). History The history of the caves was initially linked to the Amerindians, a semi nomadic tribe who lived on the Aruba island about 4000 years ago. However, a small branch of Arawak Indians, known as Caquetio, inhabited this island around 1000 AD. The villages inhabited by them were near the towns of Santa Cruz and Savaneta, and the carvings inside the caves and rock faces testify to this inference. Historians have also inferred that Arubans also lived in caves but mainly for the purposes of performing sacrificial services and holding assemblies, and sometimes also to hide in the caves during enemy attacks. Guadirikiri Cave The Guadirikiri Cave (also known as \\"Quadiriki Caves\\") is notable for its two large dome-shaped chambers which are illuminated with sunlight through holes in the ceiling. Entry to the cave is at the base of the cliff. This long cave is also a nesting site for numerous small nocturnal bats, which are harmless. In order to preserve the natural habitat of the cave for the bats to breed, one of the caves is barred for visitors. A somewhat dubious folk tale relates to a daughter of an Indian chief who fell in love and was imprisoned in the cave as her paramour was not acceptable to her father. Her beloved one was imprisoned nearby, in Huliba Cave (Tunnel of Love), but both lovers managed to meet underground. Both reportedly died in the cave and their spirit vanished into heaven through the holes in the roof of the cave. Fontein Cave The Fontein Cave is a small cave near Boca Prins on the northern part of the island. It is well known for its native Arawak drawings on the wall, which were decoratively etched by Amerindians on the stones walls and flatter roof portion of the cave in brownish-red colour or reddish brown or purplish colour; this in turn gives a clue to the history of the Amerindians. The cave is accessible from an \\"escarpment of a terrace of coral limestone\\" and has a width of and a height of . The entrance hall, which is open for visitors, is in height and extends to a depth of . As it is in limestone geological formation, solution effect due to seeping water has resulted in colourful stalagmites and stalactites formations in very odd shapes and sizes. Long tongued bats nestle in the holes of the cave which go on their nocturnal hunt to collect and feed on food in the form of nectar and pollen. It is also reported that Arawak Indians used to perform their tribal rituals and ceremonies inside this cave. Huliba Cave The Huliba Cave (known as the \\"Baranca Sunu cave\\" also meaning \\"Naked Rock\\") is nicknamed the \\"Tunnel of Love\\" for its heart-shaped entrance. The entrance is through a steep and narrow stairway which dips into the cave. It has five entrances. At places, one has to crouch to see the formations. Flashlights are needed to explore the long passageway, as it is totally dark inside the cave. The cave is studded with stalagmites and stalactites formations in limestone rocks. Two bat species residing in this cave include the Southern Long-nosed Bat and long- tongued Fruit Bat. It is interesting to watch when the bats, after sleeping in the caves during the day time, fly out in hordes in search of food. The exit from the tunnel is through a series of steps that are carved on the rock face and are quite risky. In one of the chambers, the Virgin Mary has been carved in the natural rock formation. Legend mentions about pirates inhabiting the cave to hide their treasures, though there is no proof to confirm this.Sullivan, p.82 Gallery File:Guadirikiri Cave 3.jpg File:Guadirikiri Cave.JPG File:Indian paintings in Fountein Cave 1.jpg References External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20080528142423/http://www.aruba.com/whattodo/caves.php Category:Caves of the Caribbean Category:Tourist attractions in Aruba ","title":"Caves of Aruba"},{"id":"17754542","text":"Several ships have been named Liberty: *, an American Revolutionary War ship *, a merchant vessel launched at Broadstairs and burnt by the French navy at Montserrat in 1805. * was of British origin, built in 1775, that first appeared as Liberty in 1787.

The Smith Tower can be seen background left. The Danny Woo International District Community Garden is a community garden on the outskirts of the International District, Seattle, Washington. It was built in 1975 and provides 101 allotments and 77 fruit trees. Allotment plots are allocated by preference to those aged over 65, residents of the International District, and those whose income is below 30% of the median. The garden is managed by the Inter*Im Community Development Association, a community development non-profit serving the Chinatown- International District. Much of the design in the Garden has been through the efforts of UW architecture students. In their work, they were concerned in creating a natural and Asian environment. At 1.5 acres ‚Äì the Danny Woo International District Community Garden is the largest green space in Seattle‚Äôs South Downtown. The garden serves over 70 low-income, primarily non- English speaking gardeners. The average age of the community gardeners is 76 years old. While the Gardens primarily serve low-income seniors, the Danny Woo International District Community Garden also has a Children's Garden in which 265 K-12 children go through Inter*Im's Seed-to-Plate program. The Seed-to- Plate program focuses on raising sustainable foods, promoting better nutritional choices, and teaching children the science behind food production. The Gardens utilize over 300 volunteers to aid with its operations and programs and receives over 1,000 visitors annually. In 2014, Inter*Im created a kitchen in the gardens to support their Seed-to-Plate program, as well as providing a venue for low-income community members.  Description  Tucked away on a sunny hillside overlooking the International District, a short walk from downtown Seattle, lies one of Seattle‚Äôs largest and most unique community gardens. The Danny Woo International District Community Gardens was established in 1975 by InterIm Community Development Association and the efforts of countless volunteers. The garden‚Äôs four terraces are surrounded by fruit trees and have many places for visitors to rest, gardeners to wash their vegetables, or tourists to take in the view. The paranoramic vista from the garden includes Elliot Bay, the Olympic mountains, the Port of Seattle, South Downtown, and Beacon Hill. A visitor can also enjoy the wildlife that flock to this green island in the city for food, shelter, and raising their young. The liberal plantings of trees and the shrub cover offer a great variety of habitat and foraging. Birds seen in the garden have ranged from hummingbirds to woodpeckers to hawks. These gardens have provided an oasis of lush greenery in the middle of the city for humans as well as wildlife. The Danny Woo Gardens includes 101 garden plots tended primarily by elderly, low-income, Asian residents. It provides them with opportunities for exercise, social connection, and to continue their agricultural heritage. The primary languages of the gardeners are Korean and Cantonese and the vegetables grown there reflect the Asian cultures. Most garden plots are used primarily for food production, vegetables which often find themselves into fabulous homemade kim chee shared among gardeners and community members at the annual summer pig roast, a tradition that have been carried out in the garden every year since the garden‚Äôs inception. The garden also produces an abundance of fruit from numerous trees including cherries, plums, Asian pears, and apples. These fruits are enjoyed by the gardeners, visitors, and birds as they ripen and by the community at an annual fall cider press.  History  In the early 1970s, problems existed between various small business and community agencies. The residual effects of the construction of the Kingdome and I-5 freeway left a bitter taste with many residents, while the persistent problems of crime and the removal of residential units due to the Ozark fire code and age further depressed the social and economic value of the area. In 1975, business and community leaders came together to create the Danny Woo International District Gardens to ameliorate the conditions of the International District. The garden was symbolic of what needed to be done ‚Äì a project that helped create community between the various groups in the International District. Danny Woo, a landowner and restaurateur, donated the land. A forest of six-foot-high blackberry brambles covered the property. Consequently, the conversion of the Garden to its present state demanded more than ten thousand hours of volunteer labor. In the mid-1980s additional land, given by the city of Seattle, was attached to the eastern part of the Garden. In recent years, the Garden has seen the construction of concrete stairs, a lighting system, a tool shed, and an accessible garden. The accessible garden is at the top of the hill (northernmost part of the Garden) and is for seniors who are not able to stoop down or handicapped individuals unable to walk. Additionally, Inter*Im finished the construction of two light posts and several new pathways for the gardeners.  Demographics  Inter*Im has had a policy of prioritizing the use of the Garden. International District (ID) residents who are 55 years or older are given the highest priority, while ID residents who are younger than 55 years are second on the priority list. If there is space, seniors living outside the district are given a plot. Each individual can have up to two plots. Most of the gardeners have historically been of Asian descent. Currently, many of the gardeners are either Korean or Chinese, however there are gardeners who are of Philippine, Japanese, Vietnamese, and European descent. Many of these Asian gardeners cannot speak English. The garden has seen gardeners working past their 90s in the Garden. The Garden is usually a haven for the gardeners, since many of them live in very tight quarters. Some gardeners live in Single Room Occupancy units - rooms that have no bathroom or kitchen‚Äîwhich are converted hotel rooms that used to house the immigrant Asian male community in the 20th century. Additionally, because many of the gardeners have agrarian backgrounds, gardening is a powerful recreational devise and it is also a place for many gardeners to congregate and create friendships.

In December 1849 the imperial government was replaced by a federal commission. In 1851 the German Confederation was fully re-established. The German states such as Prussia, Hanover and Austria had a quarrel regarding the ships and the costs to sustain a fleet. In 1852 the Confederation decided to dissolve the fleet and sell the ships.Walther Hubatsch: Forschungsstand und Ergebnis. In: ders. (Hrsg.): Die erste deutsche Flotte 1848-1853, E. S. Mittler und Sohn, Herford / Bonn 1981, p. 79-94, here p. 90/91. History The German Confederation, founded in 1815, was initially not in need of a navy, as it could rely on three members who commanded large fleets: The Grand Duke of Luxembourg (the King of the Netherlands) as commander of the Royal Dutch Navy, the Duke of Holstein as the commander of the Danish Navy, and last but not least, the King of Hanover as commander of the British Royal Navy. This had changed by the late 1830s, as the Kings of the Netherlands and Great Britain ceased to be members of the German Confederation, and in early 1848 Denmark also turned against Germany in the First Schleswig War. Soon, the Danish Navy stopped all German trade in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This newly created provisional government was headed by Archduke John of Austria as regent (Reichsverweser), i.e., as a temporary head of state, and he named August von Jochmus as Foreign Minister and Navy minister. The parliament first met in Frankfurt on 18 May 1848, and on 12 June 1848 the diet of the German Confederation turned over its budget to the parliament. Only two days later, the parliament decided to spend six million Reichsthaler on a navy to be under the command of Prince Adalbert of Prussia. When he had to resign due to an order by the King of Prussia, Konteradmiral Karl Rudolf Brommy took over. SMS Barbarossa in 1849 SMS Eckernf√∂rde (left), & SMS Deutschland (right) in 1849 In the Battle of Heligoland of 4 June 1849, the fleet under Brommy saw its only sea battle, which also remains the first and only naval combat under the black-red-gold flag of Germany. The battle, involving five vessels altogether, was inconclusive, with no losses on either side, but after it the Danish blockade was restored. Until 1852, the fleet had * Two sail frigates: ** ** (the captured Danish ship ) * Three steam frigates: ** (formerly ) ** ** * One sail corvette: **Franklin (donated by Hamburg, not accepted) * Six steam corvettes: ** ** ** ** ** ** * 27 gunboats * One submarine: **Brandtaucher The ships became the property of the re-established German Confederation, via the Bundeszentralkommission of 1849-1851 that dealt with the tasks of the former Central Power of the Imperial Regent. An argument arose as to whether the fleet was an 'organic institution' of the Confederation or simply a property. The majority of the Bundestag argued that it was just a property so that a decision about it did not need unanimity.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Vol. III: Bismarck und das Reich. 3. Auflage, W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart et. al. 1988, p. 138-140. On 2 April 1852, the Reichsflotte was dissolved. While most ships were sold off, two of the steam frigates were given to the Prussian Navy, which later evolved into the North German Federal Navy (1867-1871) and that then became the Imperial German Navy (1872-1918). Names Several names are used for this Navy. The resolution of 14 June 1848 just calls it \\"Deutsche Marine\\", while navy minister Arnold Duckwitz in 1849 reported about the \\"Deutsche Kriegsmarine\\" and when Karl Rudolf Brommy was promoted to its first Admiral, the name used was Reichsmarine, which was used within the Navy, too. To avoid confusion with later incarnations, historians settled for Reichsflotte. The term Bundesflotte (Federal Fleet) is also used, but this is misleading, as it was not operated by the German Confederation in its first years. Bundesflotte was also the name of an Austrian-Prussian naval project in 1865. The modern German navy since 1956 was called the Bundesmarine but now uses the name Deutsche Marine. The \\"Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs\\", article III ¬ß 19, states: :[1] The naval forces are the exclusive affair of the Reich. It is not allowed for any single state to maintain its own warships or hire privateers. :[2] The crews of the war navy are a part of the new German defence force (the term Wehrmacht is used). They are independent of the land forces. :[3] The size of the crews to be provided for the war navy from each state, is to be calculated from the number of land forces to be maintained by it. Details on this matter, as well as the balancing of costs between the Reich government and the individual states, will be determined by law. :[4] The commissioning of officers and officials of the naval forces are under the sole authority of the Reich. :[5] The care for equipping, training and maintaining a war fleet and the creation, equipping and maintenance of military harbours and arsenals falls under the authority of the Reich. :[6] The matters pertaining on the appropriations necessary for the establishment of military harbours and naval installations, as well as on the responsibilities of the corresponding Reich services will be determined by Reich laws.

Governance The parishes of Duntisbourne Rouse and the neighbouring village of Duntisbourne Abbots are covered by a single 7-person council, the Duntisbournes Parish Council. Duntisbourne Rouse is part of the Ermin ward of the district of Cotswold and is represented by Councillor Nicholas Parsons, a member of the Conservative Party. Duntisbourne Rouse is part of the constituency of Cotswold, represented at parliament by Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. It was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020. Geography Duntisbourne Rouse is in the county of Gloucestershire, and lies within the Cotswolds, a range of hills designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is approximately south-east of Gloucester and approximately north-west of Cirencester. Nearby villages include Duntisbourne Abbots, Duntisbourne Leer, Bagendon and Daglingworth. Church St. Michael's church The church at Duntisbourne Rouse is dedicated to St. Michael and is located on the side of a hill overlooking the Dunt valley. The church, which dates from Saxon times, includes a small crypt beneath the building. The chancel was added in Norman times. The choir stalls contain five misericords. Whether they were originally installed in this church or imported from elsewhere is unknown. The windows date from the 12th century, the tower from the 15th century and the pews and panelling from the 18th century. The organ was donated by Vera, Charlotte and Jeanne Beauchamp in memory of their sister, modernist writer Katherine Mansfield. A plaque to this effect is located on the side of the organ within St Michael's Church. The church was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage on 26 November 1958.

It remained at peak intensity until it was stopped being tracked on the 10th. Tropical Storm Bridget On June 16, a tropical storm was identified south of Mexico with winds of 45 mph ( /h). It weakened as it approached the Mexican mainland and dissipated later that day. Hurricane Carlotta The first hurricane of the season, Hurricane Carlotta formed on June 23 near the Mexican coast. The storm gradually strengthened and became the next day. The storm stayed as a hurricane until June 25. It rapidly weakened and was stopped being tracked on June 26 south of the Baja Peninsula of Mexico.Carlotta tracking map Tropical Storm Denise On July 6, a tropical depression formed south of Mexico. The depression had its origin in a loosely organized area of squalls which had first appeared on satellite photos late on July 5. It strengthened to a tropical storm on the 9th and was named Denise. On July 15, Denise, now in the Central Pacific weakened into a tropical depression. The depression dissipated south-west of Hawaii on July 18, never threatening land.Denise tracking map Tropical Storm Eleanor A few days after Denise formed, a new tropical depression formed south-west of the Baja Peninsula. It strengthened into a tropical storm late that night and was named Eleanor. It weakened into a tropical depression three days later, on July 16. The depression continued a long journey north-westward until July 22, when it dissipated. Eleanor never threatened land.Eleanor tracking map Tropical Storm Francene On July 24, the sixth tropical storm of the season was identified relatively close to the Mexican coast. The storm continued a north- westward direction until it dissipated south of the Baja Peninsula.Francene tracking map Tropical Storm Georgette On July 25, a tropical depression was found far from any landmass. It reached tropical storm strength the next day and was named Georgette. It dissipated on July 30.Georgette tracking map Tropical Depression Hilary On August 10, another tropical depression formed south of the Baja California Peninsula. It moved North-westward until it dissipated the next day. Hilary reportedly attained Tropical Storm strength, however the system's best track by the NHC does support the strength, and in post-storm analysis, Hilary was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Storm Ilsa On August 12, the eighth named storm of the year formed and was named Ilsa. It strengthened to a peak intensity of per hour on the 14th. The storm held peak intensity for only 6 hours and weakened to have winds of per hour. The storm weakened rapidly on the night of the 17th and dissipated the next morning never having affected land.Ilsa tracking map Hurricane Jewel On the day Ilsa dissipated, a new tropical storm was found and named Jewel. It rapidly strengthened that night and reached its peak intensity the next morning. It held peak intensity for 24 hours and weakened the next morning to a moderate tropical storm. It dissipated on the 22nd.Jewel tracking map Hurricane Katrina The first storm to make landfall, Katrina formed on August 30. It became the third hurricane of the season 30 hours after it was named. The night that Katrina became a hurricane, it made landfall on the Baja Peninsula with winds of per hour. It emerged soon after and paralleled the peninsula until making landfall at the head of the Bay of California. It rapidly weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Arizona.tracking map In Mexico, Katrina caused significant damage to parts of San Felipe. A total of 2500 people were left homeless and 60 ships were sunk. At least one person was killed.Storm Damage Aid to Mexican Village Hurricane Lily On September 5, a tropical storm formed and was named Lily. Lily became the season's fourth hurricane on the night of September 6. It slightly weakened to have winds of per hour and stayed this way for 30 hours. It weakened to a tropical storm and dissipated as a tropical cyclone on the 11th,tracking map though its surface circulation continued drifting westward near the 30th parallel north and remained identifiable on weather satellite images through the 20th. Hurricane Sarah The only storm to form in the Central Pacific this year, Sarah was found southeast of Hawaii on September 9 with winds of per hour. It weakened slightly to have winds of per hour. On September 11, Sarah became a hurricane for twelve hours, before weakening to a tropical storm. Sarah then regained hurricane status crossed into the Western Pacific. After it crossed, it rapidly strengthened to have winds of per hour. The only measured pressure reading from Sarah was found in the Western Pacific, . It steadily weakened and became extratropical with winds of per hour on the 22nd.tracking map Tropical Storm Monica On September 13, a tropical storm formed south of the Baja Peninsula and was named Monica. It weakened to a tropical depression the next morning and stayed that way until September 19. It became a tropical storm again but never regained peak intensity. It dissipated on September 20.tracking map Tropical Storm Nanette On September 13, another tropical depression formed directly south of Mexico. Twelve hours later, it became the fourteenth tropical storm of the season, Nanette. It stayed at peak intensity of per hour until September 21 when it dissipated.tracking map Hurricane Olivia The only major hurricane of the season, Olivia formed on October 6 as a tropical depression. It slowly strengthened and became a tropical storm 3 days later. As a tropical storm, Olivia again took a long time to become a hurricane. It headed north-northeast and hit Baja California with 50 mph winds. On the 13th, Olivia finally became a hurricane, while in the Gulf of California. It rapidly strengthened due to its very small size, and reached winds of per hour for six hours and made landfall on the eastern side of the Baja California Peninsula at that strength. Olivia rapidly weakened even faster than it strengthened and dissipated 18 hours after landfall.tracking map Olivia is only one of two major hurricanes to make landfall on eastern side of the Baja California Peninsula the other being Hurricane Kiko of 1989. It was also the first major hurricane to be named in the East Pacific. No damage figures exist from Olivia, due to the scarce population of the area it struck. However, a total of 61 lives were lost.http://community.livejournal.com/w_coast_weather/701707.html Hurricane Priscilla The final hurricane of the season formed on October 14 south of central Mexico as a tropical storm.

It dissipated October 20.tracking map Tropical Storm Ramona On October 21, the final tropical storm of the season formed. It became a tropical storm the next morning and was named Ramona. Ramona stayed as a tropical storm until October 25 when it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression again strengthened to a tropical storm on the 29th as the storm started to recurve. The system dissipated while heading due north on November 3.tracking map Other systems In the Central Pacific, the local hurricane center noted four systems that were likely tropical depressions but not operationally monitored.http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1967.php Storm names This was the first use of the following names.

The outcome was inconclusive, with no casualties, and the blockade went on. It remained the only battle of the German fleet.Im Juni 1849 kam es bei Helgoland zum einzigen Gefecht der, trotz des gro√üen materiellen Aufwandes, niemals voll einsatzf√§higen Bundesflotte gegen d√§nische Schiffe.- Deutsche Marine, Historydie erste und einzige Seefahrt unter der Schwarz-rot-goldnen Flagge ‚Äì Georg Wislicenus, Deutschlands Seemacht The events The German bight with Helgoland and the traditional trading routes The German Corvette SMS HamburgThe Danish Corvettes Gejser and Valkyrien being pursued by ships of the Schleswig-Holstein Navy The German Corvette SMS L√ºbeck The Danish Corvette Valkyrien fighting with Schleswig-Holstein ships in 1849 At the outbreak of the First Schleswig War, the Danes instituted a blockade, stopping all German trade in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This prompted the German parliament at Frankfurt to form a new all-German navy. The Germans had to build a fleet from scratch, buying ships abroad and converting them, and hiring foreign officers (British, Belgian) to lead native veteran merchant mariners.Lawrence Sondhaus, Naval Warfare, 1815‚Äì1914 p. 49 After about a year of preparation, on 4 June, German Admiral Karl Rudolf Brommy left Bremerhaven with the steam frigate SMS Barbarossa (formerly RMS Britannia) and the smaller steam corvettes L√ºbeck (1844) and Hamburg (1841) in order to disperse the Danish ships which were guarding the mouth of Weser River. The Danish forces present that day were inferior and retreated, but Brommy managed to cut off the sailing corvette Valkyrien which under captain Andreas Polder sought refuge near the island of Heligoland which at the time belonged to the United Kingdom. The British, while being neutral, had made clear beforehand that a German Navy was not welcome and might be treated as pirates. Ships of both sides fired some shots, with no effect. When the German approached the island's three-mile zone, the British forces fired warning shots towards them, while allowing the Danish corvette to stay close. Brommy, not willing to draw the Royal Navy into the war, stayed at a distance while the Danish captain Polder was waiting for the arrival of reinforcements from the Danish main fleet. When the modern steamer Gejser, under Kaptajnl√∏jtnant (captain lieutenant) J√∏rgen Peter Frederik Wulff, came into sight, Brommy retreated, fearing further Danish reinforcements. The Danes followed the Germans to the mouth of the Elbe near Cuxhaven before resuming the blockade. It was the first and the last excursion of the small fleet under the black-red-gold Flag of Germany.

Smith (full name Anita Miller Smith, October 20, 1893 ‚Äì 1968) was an impressionist and regionalist painter most closely associated with Woodstock, New York. In the 1930s Smith became an herbalist, and her venture, Stonecrop Gardens, was one of only five enterprises of like size in the Northeast, serving clients in every one of the 48 contiguous states.Browning, Betty, \\"Garden Hobby Grows to One Now of Business Importance\\", Sunday Press, Kingston, NY (1940), 1, 2. During this phase of her career, she authored and published As True as the Barnacle Tree, a short herbal based on ancient and contemporary practices. In the 1950s she wrote the town of Woodstock's first history, Woodstock History and Hearsay. Upbringing Smith's paternal ancestor, Giles Knight, arrived in the American colonies aboard The Welcome with William Penn in 1682. Knight, a Quaker and former English landowner, established a farm in the Byberry region of Pennsylvania. One of Knight's descendants, Henry Cavalier Smith, an attorney-at-law, married Lucy Pancoast Miller. The couple assumed control of Wyndlawn, the Smith country estate in Torresdale, Pennsylvania. This was where Anita M. Smith was born on October 20, 1893, the youngest of five children. In 1910 Smith and her mother embarked on a tour of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Smith also took instruction at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, the art studios of Ferruccio Scattola in Venice, the atelier Forcello in Cairo, and the British Academy in Rome. Each day was divided between morning art instruction and afternoon tours of such museums as the Louvre in Paris, the Palace of the Doges in Venice, and ancient cathedrals including St. Sophia's in Constantinople. Career as an artist In 1912 Smith ventured up to the art colony at Woodstock, New York, using money intended for a ball gown, and enrolled in the Art Students League summer program. That fall she returned to Philadelphia to take lessons from William Merritt Chase. In an interview with the Poughkeepsie Sunday New Yorker, she described how her deepening commitment to art forced her to move away from Philadelphia. Later on in the article, she said she that she believed it \\"necessary to dig into the history of the countryside\\" and that she \\"didn't see how one could paint the Catskills without knowing something of the people who lived among them, thus reflecting a literary approach to art.\\"Jonas, Louise, \\"Debutante, Anita Smith, Chose to Become Ulster Herbalist\\", Poughkeepsie Sunday New Yorker, (November 22, 1942), 5A. In 1913 she commenced studies under John F. Carlson at the Arts Students League in Woodstock. Smith painted in an impressionist and a post-impressionist manner. She worked in oil, watercolor and graphic media. Primarily a landscape artist, she painted landscapes in a variety of area including New Hope, Pennsylvania, Provincetown, Massachusetts; Charleston, South Carolina, New York City, Taxco de Alarcon, Mexico and Paris, France. From 1916 to 1928 Smith's works were exhibited nationally at such venues as the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, the Art Gallery of Toronto, the Woodstock Artists Association, the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Louisville Art Association. In 1919 her painting Houses in the Dunes won a Lambert Purchase Prize at the Pennsylvania Academy‚Äîalong with the work of such fellow artists as Paulette Van Roekens and Lilian Westcott Hale. Career as a herbalist In the 1930s Miss Smith embarked on a second career as an herbalist after the Great Depression prompted her to leave painting. She wrote that people with a sense of color are supposed to have a keen sense of taste and, since many of the artists were excellent cooks, she and her associates tried to share tasty dishes with one another. To accomplish this, she found it necessary to grow a few herbs for culinary purposes. She was also an enthusiastic gardener and she found that her hobby changed to a vocation as her herb gardens began to turn a profit. This was during a time when popular interest in herbs soared across the country. In 1934 Smith built a bluestone cottage near the Rock City Corners at the base of Overlook Mountain, about a mile from the center of Woodstock. By 1937 a greenhouse was added, and a short time later she had over 150 herbs under cultivation, with commercial clients that included H.J. Heinz. During this period, Smith's As True as the Barnacle Tree was cited in a New York Herald Tribune article, and its writer dubbed her \\"The Herb Lady of the Catskills\\". After the war, Dr. James T. Shotwell, a neighbor and friend, asked Smith to compile a service database; the record was to include all Woodstockers who fought for their country during the Second World War. This formed a key chapter in her soon-to-be-published book, Woodstock History and Hearsay‚Äîthe town's first official chronicle. Smith based her narrative on detailed scholarship as well as a wide-ranging collection of local folk stories gathered from Catskill mountain families and resident artists. The story's arc begins with Native American times and concludes with chapters on the art colony, leading up to the Woodstock Festival of 1969. Smith also wrote The Landscape of History and The Quest of Abel Knight: The Quakers and Shakers. Because of a resurgence of public interest in Smith's paintings, her works were exhibited at the USArtists Show in 2003 and 2005. In 2006, publisher WoodstockArts released a second edition of Woodstock History and Hearsay.

Originally from the town of Patti in Sicily (and closely connected to the figure of Saint Febronia), the relics of Trofimena are venerated in the basilica in the town of Minori, Italy on the coast of Amalfi, southern Italy. Hagiography Trofimena's hagiographical history is unfortunately contorted. The key legend says she was martyred while still a young girl in the town of Patti in Sicily, around the age of 12 or 13 by her own father because she wanted to be baptised and embrace Christianity. A story is told of a vision of an angel who announced her consecration to Christ and imminent martyrdom, and advised against wedding plans already advanced by her family. After death, Trofimena's body is hidden protectively in an urn and thrown into the sea, the current taking it to the coast of Salerno in southern Italy, and directly to the town of Minori. The urn is discovered by the people of Minori who have it carried by a pair of white calves in the presence of Bishop Peter of Amalfi (c.829); and where the beasts stop a church is built and dedicated. The calves refusing to move from the spot and the people interpreting it as a divine signal on the choice of place. At least one modern scholar has drawn parallels with the myth of the siren, Parthenope, who was said to inhabit the small islands of the shore of Naples with her sisters. When she had failed to win over Ulysses with her music, Parthenope died and her body was carried by ocean currents to the shore where the people discovered the goddess with closed eyes and white face, and took her remains to place them in a magnificent tomb accompanied by sacrifices and torchlight processions to the sea.Jorfan Lancaster, In the shadow of Vesuvius, Taurus, 2005 Medieval despoliation of relics View of Minori The subsequent history of the town of Minori is tied to the cult and veneration of Trofimena and for more than 1,000 years the town has jealously conserved her relics. The relics have a historic record certainly stretching back to at least 838‚Äì839 AD according to an anonymous 9th century chroniclerHistoria inventionis ac traslationes et Miracula Sanctae Trofimenae, cited in Ferdinando Ughelli, Italia Sacra, Venice, 1721 that narrated the discovery and transferral of the relics under Sicard, the Longobard Prince of Benevento. Under that account, the relics were deposited in the town church with great pomp. Miracles were then said to have occurred, and large charitable donations made. By visions and other indications the saint expressed her determination to remain. Trofimena's repose was short, for in the year 838 Sicard of Benevento, having erected a church in his own capital, went in search of relics for it, and engaged some sailors from the neighbouring city of Amalfi to procure for him the body of St. Bartholomew, preserved in Lipari. The Amalfitans, fearing that Sicard might also seize Trofimena's relics from Minori (a town not capable of repelling attack), carried the remains by boat to Amalfi, and deposited them in their cathedral. Again the legend records Trofimena's displeasure at being taken from Minori when Bishop Peter is warned that he will die shortly for violating the tomb, and his corpse eaten by wild dogs. Sicard, returning from a successful expedition against the Saracens, directed his fleet towards Amalfi, invaded the city, and carried away the bones - first to Salerno, and from there to Benevento. Bishop Peter's tomb was violated and his body indeed left to the dogs. However the following year, 839, Sicard was assassinated, and two priests from Minori immediately begged for the surrender of the saint with both Prince Radelchis and the Bishop of Benevento, threatening Radelchis with the eternal enmity of the Amalfitans in case of refusal. Before the arrival of the relics of Andrew from Constantinople, Trofimena enjoyed considerable veneration along the whole of the Amalfi territory, because she was the only saint of whom they possessed actual relics. An agreement was reached to release the body excluding the top of the skull. The relics were transported to Minori, with much rejoicing, and on 13 July 840 were jealously hidden within the basilica. In 987 Minori was elevated to a bishopric. However, the passing centuries led to the memory of the exact position of the relics being lost. Despite having a number of names - Trufumena, Trefonia, Febronia ‚Äì on 21 January 1673 the Sacred Congregation of Rites in Rome confirmed that the saint would be known henceforth in the martyrs calendar as Trofimena. In 1694 the Neapolitan playwright Carmino Scassafer published a \\"sacred tragedy\\" entitled L'Innocenza per seguitata overo Santa Trofimena, dealing dramatically with the life of the saint. Bishop Silvestro Stana began the remodelling of the cathedral in the late-18th century, and a few years later the relics were rediscovered on the night of 27 November 1793. Modern-day veneration Today, Trofimena's relics are housed in the basilica in Minori. A medieval church was built around c.700 on the original basement of an ancient Roman church; was remodelled in the 12th century; and this was superseded by a complete rebuilding in the 18th century. In the crypt of the Basilica, on the main altar, the remains of Santa Trofimena are kept in an alabaster urn designed by the sculptor Gennaro Ragazzino in 1722. An ancient church of Trofimena still exists in Salerno where some of her relics (the top of her skull) are preserved. In modern-day New York City emigrants from Minori have erected a chapel to Trofimena and have a copy of the statue that is carried in procession as part of the celebrations as Patroness of Minori. Feast days Three feast days honour Trofimena in the religious calendar of Catholic saints. 5 November is the celebration of the original discovery of her relics on the beach of Minori in the 700s. The 27 November celebration marks the rediscovery of the reliquary urn in the late 18th century. The 13 July has become the most important festival as it falls during the summer and commemorates an important miracle. Minori was being attacked from the sea by Arab pirates. Villagers invoked the intercession of Trofimena who on a lovely summer day summoned up a terrible tempest that shipwrecked the attacking horde. Trofimena and Febronia According to her sixth-century Vita,S. A. Harvey and S. Brock, Holy Women of the Syrian Orient (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), 150-176 Febronia of Nisibis was a beautiful nun martyred during the Diocletian persecution. Her cult began in Syria, and spread from there to Constantinople, Southern Italy and Sicily. Translations of Febronia's \\"Passio\\" suggest her name reappears as Phebronia, Pambroniya, Sephronia, Sophronia, and Trofimena P. Chiesa, Le Versioni Latine della Passio Sanctae Febroniae: Storia, Metodo, Modelli di Due Traduzioni Agiografiche Altomedievali (Spoleto: Centro Italiano de Studi Sull'alto Medioevo, 1990). Although the Synaxarium of Constantinople claims that Febronia's relics reached the city by 363,there seems to be no evidence of her cult in Constantinople before the seventh century. At that time she appears as an assistant to St. Artemios in the Miracles of St. Artemios, which describe a chapel erected to Febronia in the church of St. John Prodomos. The 7th century Emperor Heraclius may have had a daughter by his second wife, Martina, named Febronia; and his campaigns in Mesopotamia could perhaps have brought him into contact with the legend of a local martyr, Febronia, and through him, therefore, her story could have been \\"Byzantinized.\\" Febronia's Latin life dates to the ninth century, not long after a series of Syrian popes came to Italy in the eighth century. A cult around Febronia subsequently sprung up in Palagonia (CT), Patti (ME) and Minori(SA). According to modern scholars, it is extremely likely that the legends of Febronia and Trofimena are one and the same.

In 1898 he received the Democratic Nomination for New York State governor against the Republican choice, Theodore Roosevelt.  Background  Augustus Van Wyck was born in New York City on October 14, 1850, a son of William Van Wyck and Lydia Ann (Maverick) Van Wyck. His brother Robert A. Van Wyck served as Mayor of New York City. Charles Van Wyck was a distant cousin; their common ancestors were Theodorus Van Wyck (1668-1753) and his wife Margretia Brinckerhoff Van Wyck. His older brother Samuel, a Confederate surgeon, was killed during the war and his sister, Lydia Ann, married Robert Hoke, a Confederate General. Roots of the Van Wyck family date back to early Dutch immigration to North America. One of the first descendants of the family, Cornelius Barents Van Wyck came from the town of Wyck, the Netherlands in 1650. Augustus Van Wyck's education led him to Phillips Exeter Academy and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study law. Moving to Richmond, Virginia Van Wyck practiced law for a brief period before moving to Brooklyn, New York in 1871. He was an active member of the Democratic party in Brooklyn. In 1882 Van Wyck was elected as President of the Brooklyn Democratic Party's general committee. He also participated in several local, county, state, and national party conventions.  Supreme Court Justice of Brooklyn  In 1884, Augustus Van Wyck was elected to the Superior Court in Brooklyn until transferred to the Supreme Court where he remained until 1896.  Democratic Nomination for New York State Governor  Much to Van Wyck's surprise, he was nominated by his fellow Democrats to oppose Republican nominee Theodore Roosevelt in the race for Governor of New York in 1898. Although Van Wyck was seen as a strong candidate, Roosevelt's popularity in the aftermath of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War led him to win narrowly; Van Wyck received 643,921 votes, while Roosevelt received 661,715.Timeline of Theodore Roosevelt's Life by the Theodore Roosevelt Association at www.theodoreroosevelt.org After the election Van Wyck resumed his law practice on 149 Broadway, New York.

Though he wrote hundreds of articles or books, Wroth was also a librarian and research professor. Early years Wroth was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1884, the son of an Episcopal clergyman. He served with the 110th and 111th Field Artillery in World War I during the period of 1917 to 1919 in France. Career In 1905, Wroth graduated from Johns Hopkins University and wrote his first published article, \\"Sanitation in the Country House\\", which appeared in the magazine Country Life in America. His first book, published in 1911, Parson Weems; a biographical and critical study, was a biography of George Washington's biographer. His last book, published in 1970, The voyages of Giovanni da Verrazzano, 1524-1528, was also a biography. Though Wroth wrote over 550 pieces, he is most notable for two books on colonial printing: A History of Printing in Colonial Maryland: 1686-1776, published in 1922, a study of printing in colonial Maryland; and The Colonial Printer, published in 1931, a study in the printing trade during the American colonial period. Both books detailed the first colonial printing presses, colonial printing houses, typeset, printing ink, paper, journeymen, apprentices, conditions of the trade, and bookbinding. The content and finish of the completed books, pamphlets, and papers of the period are also discussed. In his publications on printing in colonial America, Wroth notably included the history of colonial women printers, such as: Dinah Nuthead, Anne Catherine Hoof Green, Sarah Updike Goddard, Clementina Rind, and Mary Goddard. Wroth expressly stated that the book was written \\"as a discussion of certain fundamental aspects of cultural history\\"Wroth 1995:3 and that the book was not intended as an \\"essay in bibliophilism\\", though his love of books is evident:Wroth 1995:xvii > \\"To love the contents of a book and care nothing about the volume itself, to > love the treasure and to be unmindful of the earthen vessel that loyally > holds and preserves it, is to be only half a lover, deaf to a whole series > of notes in the gamut of emotion.

He worked at the Maryland Diocesan Library in Baltimore from 1905 to 1912 before becoming assistant librarian at Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library from 1912 to 1923. While at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, Wroth served as librarian of the John Carter Brown Library for 35 years (1924 ‚Äî 1957), and held a university post as Research Professor of American History (1932‚Äì1965).

The compromise which ended the filibuster \\"removed language which would have required a judge, not a jury, to review facts in worker discrimination cases.\\" In March 2016, she led a 39-hour filibuster of a bill that would have legalized discrimination against gay couples. After passing the 24-hour mark, former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis, known for her own 11-hour filibuster of a bill restricting abortions, tweeted an offer to loan Chappelle-Nadal \\"a certain pair of shoes for the [filibuster].\\" In April 2016, Chappelle-Nadal filibustered a bill regarding sales tax by reading \\"The 50th Law\\", an autobiography detailing the life and career of rapper 50 Cent. Chappelle-Nadal filibustered the bill because St. Louis County had not agreed to a consent decree proposed by the Department of Justice that was offered to the Ferguson Police Department following the use of tear gas and excessive force against protesters. Radioactive waste legislation Chappelle-Nadal has raised awareness of radioactive waste in the St. Louis region. Individuals living near the West Lake landfill and Coldwater Creek have reported a number of health problems, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. In 2012, Chappelle-Nadal wrote an article for Patch Media in which she criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to clean up the waste and acknowledge the threat posed by its existence in the West Lake Landfill. In 2013, Chappelle-Nadal proposed Senate Concurrent Resolution 11 which urged Congress to \\"transfer authority for the remediation of the West Lake Landfill radioactive waste from the EPA to the Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP).\\" In 2014, Chappelle-Nadal proposed Senate Concurrent Resolution 23, which mirrored SCR 11. In January 2016, Chappelle-Nadal proposed Senate Bill 600 which would have created a buyout program of contaminated homes near the Bridgeton Landfill. In 2017, Chappelle-Nadal proposed Senate Bill 22 which would create a $12 million buyout program that would purchase homes contaminated with radioactive waste within a radius of the Bridgeton Landfills. On April 12, 2017, Senate Bill 22 was approved by the Missouri Senate and sent to the Missouri House of Representatives. Town hall meetings On September 6, 2015, Chappelle- Nadal held her first town hall meeting in St. Louis regarding radioactive waste resulting from processing uranium ore for the Manhattan Project during World War II. Chappelle-Nadal has since held 70 town hall meetings and aims to hold a total of 100 town hall meetings by the end of 2017. Chappelle-Nadal believes that part of the solution is to convene a congressional investigatory panel focusing on the EPA's inaction on legacy nuclear waste contamination in the St. Louis region. Trump assassination social media post On August 17, 2017, in response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Chappelle-Nadal replied to a comment on one of her Facebook posts, writing \\"I hope Trump is assassinated!\\" She then deleted the comment, though it quickly spread online. The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating her comment. Chappelle-Nadal later told KMOV, \\"No, I don't want to see anyone assassinated, but he should not be president, he should be impeached.\\" She later issued a formal apology for her comments. Missouri U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, Congressman Lacy Clay, and Missouri Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh were among the state and national Democrats calling for her resignation. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has called for her resignation.Editorial: Time for Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal to exit gracefully, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, August 21, 2017. In response to Chappelle-Nadal's social media post State Representative Joshua Peters sent a letter to the chairman of the Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions and Ethics Committee, requesting that a special committee consider Chappelle-Nadal's \\"censure or removal\\" from office.Wicentowski, Danny.

Other roles Chappelle-Nadal is a former member of the Democratic National Committee, serving from 2005 to 2009. Chappelle-Nadal worked as director of communications for Lt. Governor Joe Maxwell in 2010. She also served as the director of boards and commissions, later becoming Missouri's senior advocate. Legislation associated with her work in these roles includes the Senior Care and Protection Act of 2003, and the Missouri Senior Rx Generic Drug Rebate. In addition, Chappelle-Nadal was one of Missouri's superdelegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Chappelle-Nadal currently serves as director on the University City School Board. Role in Ferguson unrest Chappelle-Nadal took part in the protests over the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014. She criticized the police response to the civil unrest and the way the crisis was handled within the community. During the protests, Chappelle-Nadal was among the protesters who were tear-gassed by law enforcement officials. Chappelle-Nadal asserted that institutional inequality is a major issue underpinning the unrest in Ferguson, contributing to tensions between police and an angered community: \\"I have to tell you that there has been systematic racism, institutionally in state government for decades, including my own state party,\\" she said. \\"People are angry, and they are hurt, and they're trying to figure out: how are they going to receive justice?\\" Chappelle-Nadal proposed legislation in 2015 to re-examine policies related to use of deadly force and proper legal procedures following officer-involved deaths. During the unrest, Chappelle-Nadal sent several expletive-laden tweets to then Governor Jay Nixon criticizing him for his response to the protests and riots.

Smith (March 15, 1906 ‚Äì November 17, 1980) was an American animator and director. He began as an cel painter for Disney in August 1926, then moved up to an animator when he remembered he didn't work behind a curtain, but a back room. On May 5, 1928, when all the Oswald cartoons for Mintz were completed, Smith left the payroll. Smith worked for the Walter Lantz studio for much of his career, first starting as an animator, and then as a director. He also animated at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. By 1955, Smith had taken over as primary director of the Woody Woodpecker cartoon shorts, with periodic fill-in shorts directed by peers Alex Lovy, Jack Hannah, and Sid Marcus. With Smith in the director's chair, the Woody Woodpecker series maintained its trademark frenetic energy, while the animation itself was simplified, due to budget constraints. By the late 1960s, Smith became the sole director of the Lantz studio's output: the cartoon series Woody Woodpecker, Chilly Willy, and The Beary Family. Smith stayed with Lantz until the studio was closed in 1972. Smith died in Van Nuys, California on November 17, 1980.

Situated in the heart of the town, the church was consecrated to the invocation of Saint James, son of Zebedee.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.15 History The first substantial church was probably erected in Est√¥mbar in the first half of the 16th century (while Lagoa was still part of the municipality/concelho of Silves). The style of the main door of the church and its affinity to similar buildings such as the principal churches of Alvor and of Odi√°xere, and Santa Miseric√≥rdia Church of Silves suggests the existence of a regional sub-group of Manueline architecture in the Algarve.Francisco I.C. Lameira (n.d.), p.3. The popular prevailing style of the time is reflected in this church: a tripartite nave with a wooden ceiling, no transept, and altars at the head of the nave on each side of the chancel, as well as side chapels.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.16 The first documented reference dates to 1719/1745, referring to the main altar and the collateral chapels. The earlier church was badly damaged in the 1755 earthquake during which the bell tower collapsed.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.84 The Manueline doorway survived,Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.55 as did the tiling in the chancel end. Reconstruction took a number of years since various of alterations were introduced, including the replacement of the original interior columns with cylindrical classical ones reflecting contemporary taste (a revival of the style of the second half of the sixteenth century) similar to what occurred in Lagoa and St. Peter (S√£o Pedro) of Faro. It is thought that, as in Lagoa, the Faro master carver Manuel Francisco Xavier,Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.90 among others, played a part in the design and supervision of the reconstruction. We have a record of Xavier resigning his contract in 1769 because of the death of one of his partners. Eventually the work was finished in 1770, having cost the Building Commission (Comiss√£o Fabriqueira) the sum of 630 milr√©is.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.92 By 1965, the church was in a bad state, with the ceiling and doorways damaged, in addition to problems with water infiltration that damaged the interior and walls. An earthquake on 28 February 1969, caused further damage to the towers, vaulted ceiling over the altar, the triumphal archway and divisions between the naves. The state of pavement in the churchyard was degraded in 1983. Architecture Main Door Door capitals The 18th century was a period of great prosperity, and also of great artistic activity in Portugal. This period saw the refurbishing of all the chapels, which in many cases also involved the disappearance of the earlier decoration. Only some wooden carvings of the 16th and 17th centuries survived, appearing in the new altar pieces side by side with more recent carvings.Francisco I.C. Lameira (n.d.), p.4 The three altars at the chancel- end of the church fit the Baroque style both in their decoration and in terms of the tile facings on the walls. The tiles covering the vaulted areas around each of the altars and the end wall of the nave above the chancel date to 1719 and reflect the popular national blue-on-white style of the period. One panel in the chancel represents St. James on a caravel fighting the Moors in the naval Battle of Lepanto (1571) in which Dom John of Austria defeated the Turks. The panel reflects the military and religious power of Christianity over Islam, an implicit message for the descendants of the Muslims still resident in the area and who still maintained certain Muslim traditions.Francisco I.C. Lameira (n.d.), p.6Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.107-125 Since there appears to have been no major tile workshops in the Algarve at the time, recourse was made to Lisbon tile masters, and one hypothesis links these tiles to the workshop of Policarpo de Oliveira Bernardes.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.125-127 The altarpiece which stands out most is that of the chancel, created by the Monchique master-carver Cust√≥dio de Mesquita under a 1709 contract. This piece is significant because it is the only known piece by this particular carver. Its stylistic links to other altarpieces in the Algarve suggests his participation in a Western Algarve ‚Äúschool‚Äù.Francisco I.C. Lameira (n.d.), p.5Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.104 The predominant style of the second half of the 18th century was Rococo, and examples of this style appear in a few items rebuilt after the earthquake: the throne in the tribune of the altarpiece in the chancel (ca. 1760);Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.140-142 the altarpiece of the chapel of Christ Crucified;Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.142 and the arches of the two chapels along the Epistle side of the church.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.146-150 Chapels The Chapel of Christ Crucified (Capela do Senhor Jesus Crucificado) was constructed in 1589, according to a date on the front of the arch over it. In the same area are two Renaissance medallions showing the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul.Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.73-75 The altarpiece dates from the third quarter of the 18th century, a good example of the Rococo style. The central area is filled by pictures of Our Lady of Sorrows and of St. John the Evangelist, and by the large sculpture of Christ Crucified. Although we do not know the creator of this piece, it appears to be by an Algarve artist, reflecting the technical and artistic mastery found elsewhere in the region.Francisco I.C. Lameira (n.d.), p.7Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.143-146 The other side chapels are the Chapel of Saint Anthony (Santo Ant√≥nio) and the Chapel of the Souls (das Almas).Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008) p.146-149 Treasures The church has a fine ivory crucifix from Portuguese India. After the arrival of Europeans, ivory carvings of western religion themes were produced in large numbers in the 17th and 18th centuries, mainly for the metropolitan market where they were installed in many private oratories of wealthier people. Some of these made their way to the Algarve and some of those came into the possession of various churches, often through pious donations. The crucifix in this church is 54 x 52 cm. Despite some damage to the fingers, it is a fine example of the 18th-century Indo-Portuguese imagination. Neither the donor nor the date of acquisition is known, other than it was part of the altarpiece of the chancel in the 19th century.Francisco I.C. Lameira (n.d.), p.2Jo√£o Miguel Sim√µes (2008), p.173 In the inside of the entrance doors are two Manueline columns, one on each side, on which are carved various figures framed in little niches. The long procession of figures probably alludes again to the supremacy of Christianity over Islam. One can pick out various musicians (with tambourines, bagpipes, violas, etc.), members of the regular and secular clergies, nobles, simple people, and slaves. These columns were only rediscovered in 1946; up to then they had been completely encased in thick layers of plaster and whitewash.Francisco I.C.

The ministry's objectives include evangelising and spreading Christianity among the Iranian diaspora. Background Donald Fareed was born into a Shia Muslim family in Iran during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. His family was very dysfunctional and his parents divorced when he was a child. In his website, Fareed claims that he was very outspoken as a youth and as a result, got into trouble with the Savak, which was the secret police apparatus of the Shah. He became disillusioned with orthodox Islam as a teenager and turned to Sufism. However, he soon became dissatisfied by what he perceived as the \\"superstitious and complicated nature of Sufism\\" and rejected Islam completely. He became interested in Christianity in 1990 after having a chance encounter with three Christian pastors and a dream in which a vision of Jesus Christ appeared to him. He converted to Christianity a year later. His conversion would influence most of his family members to embrace Christianity as well. Fareed is a strong advocate of democracy and Western secular ideals. He has partnered with Sattar Deldar, a pro-democracy Muslim television broadcasting executive, to promote democracy and regime change in Iran since 2001.

It is the right-hand side of the altar as viewed by the congregation from the nave. The Gospel side is the other side of the church, where the Gospel is read. Facing the altar from the nave, it is the left-hand side. In some places, especially if a comment is based on a romance language source, the Gospel side will be cited as the Evangelist side.

Hear him!\\" The church teaches this was an actual visitation by God the Father and Jesus in the flesh. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) focuses its doctrine and teaching on Jesus Christ; that he was the Son of God, born of Mary, lived a perfect life, performed miracles, bled from every pore in the Garden of Gethsemane, died on the cross, rose on the third day, appeared again to his disciples, and now resides, authoritatively, on the right hand side of God. In brief, some beliefs are in common with Catholics, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. However, teachings of the LDS Church differ significantly in other ways and encompass a broad set of doctrines, so that the above-mentioned denominations usually place the LDS Church outside the bounds of orthodox Christian teaching as summarized in the Nicene Creed. The church's core beliefs, circa 1842, are summarized in the \\"Articles of Faith\\", and its four primary principles are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, and the laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Beliefs and doctrine  Apostasy and restoration  In common with other Restorationist churches, the LDS Church teaches that a Great Apostasy occurred. It teaches that after the death of Jesus and the Twelve Apostles, the priesthood authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including the text of the Bible, were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a restoration prior to the Second Coming. That restoration, according to church doctrine, began during the life of Joseph Smith. According to church theology, the restoration began through a series of visions and revelations, including Smith's First Vision in 1820, visits by various angelic messengers including Moroni from whom he received \\"the everlasting gospel\\", John the Baptist, Moses, Elijah, and the apostles Peter, James and John. Both Smith and Oliver Cowdery testified that these last messengers came to them while they were together and conferred upon them the priesthood authority with its various \\"keys\\", so that mankind again possessed the \\"fullness of the Gospel\\" with authority to administer in the ordinances thereof.See Pearl of Great Price, Salt Lake City, 1981 footnote pp. 58‚Äì59. The restoration also included the re-establishment of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830. The LDS Church teaches that it is the successor of this Church of Christ and that the current President of the Church is Smith's modern successor.  Sacred texts  The standard works of the LDS Church printed in the Quadruple Combination format, often referred to simply as a \\"Quad\\" :See also: Genetics and the Book of Mormon and Archaeology and the Book of Mormon The church's canon of sacred texts consists of the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. These are more commonly referred to as the church's standard works. Though not canonical, many members of the church also accept the teachings and pronouncements of the church's general authorities‚Äîand in particular those of the President of the Church‚Äîas doctrine, and complementing the standard works. The church accepts the Holy Bible as the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.See \\"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\\" Joseph Smith wrote, \\"I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers\\".Teachings of The Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 327. The LDS Church uses the Authorized King James Version (KJV) for its English-speaking members and other translations to accommodate alternative languages. Smith did work on his own translation, but it is only used in conjunction with the KJV. Extract of his translation can be found in the Pearl of Great Price, called the Book of Moses and Joseph Smith‚ÄîMatthew. For English-language speakers, the church encourages the use of the King James Version,. and the church publishes an edition of the KJV. The church regards parts of the Apocrypha, the writings of some Protestant Reformers and non-Christian religious leaders, and the non-religious writings of some philosophers to be inspired, though not canonical. The church's most distinctive scripture, the Book of Mormon, was published by founder Joseph Smith in 1830. It is believed to be \\"another testament of Jesus Christ\\" and bears that subtitle as of 1982.See the title page of the Book of Mormon Smith stated that, under divine direction, he translated the Book of Mormon from metal plates having \\"the appearance of gold\\" found buried near his home. Eight men signed a statement as witnesses that Smith possessed the plates and that they had seen them.See Testimony of the Eight Witnesses, printed in the front portion of the Book of Mormon. , the full text of the Book of Mormon had been translated and published in 77 languages, and selections in an additional 28 for a total of 105 languages.2008 Church Almanac, Deseret Morning News, Salt Lake City pg. 656 The introduction printed with the book says that it is a history of the ancestors of the \\"American Indian\\" peoples.However, this introduction is not officially recognized by the church as being part of the divinely inspired canon of scripture. The church's Doctrine and Covenants is a collection of modern revelations, declarations, and teachings, primarily written by Smith. The Pearl of Great Price consists of five separate books, including two portions of Smith's translation of the Bible. These five books are Selections from the Book of Moses (corresponding to a portion of the Old Testament), the Book of Abraham (Smith's translation of an Egyptian papyrus, which includes an account of the creation), Joseph Smith‚ÄîMatthew (corresponding to a section of the New Testament), Joseph Smith‚ÄîHistory (an excerpt from Smith's 1838 autobiographical writings), and the Articles of Faith (an excerpt of one of Smith's 1842 letters describing church beliefs). God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost In LDS Church teachings, God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are referred to as the \\"Godhead\\".For a different view on the term Godhead, see Godhead (Christian). According to LDS scripture, the Godhead has the following attributes: *They are three separate and distinct beings.. *They are collectively \\"one God\\", meaning that they are united in spirit, mind, and purpose.Joseph Fielding Smith, \\"Teachings\\", p. 311, 372 According to LDS theology, Jesus is \\"one\\" with the Father in the same way as he asked his disciples to be \\"one\\" with him and each other. *Jesus and the Father have physical \\"bodies of flesh and bone\\", while the Holy Spirit does not, though the Holy Spirit has a \\"spirit body\\". *God the Father is understood to be the literal father of the spirits of humanity,. See also, , , as well as the literal father of both the spirit and physical body of Jesus. The church's view of the Godhead breaks with Nicene Creed tradition and believes it returns to the teachings taught by Jesus. It does not accept the creed's definition of Trinity that the three are \\"consubstantial\\" nor the Athanasian Creed'sCatholic Encyclopedia (1913): The Athanasian Creed statement that they are \\"incomprehensible\\", arguing that the LDS view is self-evident in the Bible that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are separate persons‚Äîthree divine beings as illustrated in Jesus' farewell prayer, his baptism at the hands of John, his transfiguration, and the martyrdom of Stephen. In addition to the Godhead, LDS theology recognizes at least the possibility of other divine entities; however, these other \\"gods\\" and \\"goddesses\\" are not considered to be objects of worship, and have no direct relevance to salvation. Official church materials refer to \\"Heavenly Parents\\", implying to some the existence of a Heavenly Mother. Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has been mentioned in meetings by church officialsSee, e.g., . and alluded to in two of the hymns of the church.See, e.g., Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985), #292 \\"O My Father\\"; #286 Oh, What Songs of the Heart. However, very little on the subject of a Heavenly Mother has been taught by the church. =God the Father= God the Father is understood to be the literal Father of the spirits of all mankind., He is also understood to be the father of Jesus' spirit body and his physical body. On the morning that Jesus was resurrected, Jesus said to Mary Magdalene, \\"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\\" LDS Church president Lorenzo Snow expressed the nature of the Father in his couplet, \\"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be\\", which differs significantly from the traditional Christian idea of theosis. Exaltation is a belief among members of the LDS Church that mankind, as spirit children of their Father in heaven, can become like him. =Jesus Christ= Christus statue in the North Visitors' Center on Temple Square in Salt Lake City The church follows what it understands to be the teachings of Jesus, both in the Bible and in other scriptures, such as the Book of Mormon. According to that book, Jesus Christ is \\"the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.\\" As the Creator, he is at times referred to as the father of heaven and earth. This is one sense in which he shares the title \\"Father\\" with God the Father. The church also teaches that Jesus is the LORD Jehovah of the Old Testament, and the Holy One of Israel. Because he has the \\"Divine Investiture of Authority\\" from the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ often speaks in the scriptures as though he were God the Father, because in so doing he is representing the Father. Early leaders taught that Jesus had multiple wives Quote reproduced at byui.edu. and children during his mortal ministry in promotion of Mormon polygamy, but this is no longer a widely held belief or teaching in the church. The church teaches that those who accept Christ and are baptized are symbolically born again and become the children of Christ. It additionally states that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. Christ's divinity enabled him to take upon himself the penalty for sin and to endure the consequential suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross that paid for the sins of humanity since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Thus, having satisfied the demands of justice, Christ offers mercy to mankind in two general forms: unconditional (all will be resurrected),; and conditional (those who believe in Christ, repent of sin, and are baptized, ‚Äúthe same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God\\") This Atonement is also believed to cover not only sin, but all pain, suffering, heartache, or hardship experienced in this life. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus' status as the son of a mortal woman gave him the ability to suffer temptation (yet he did not succumb to it) and experience physical death; while his status as the Son of God gave him the power to lay down and take up his life again at will. The church also believes in the physical resurrection of Jesus' body.; Because of its emphasis on Jesus' resurrection and his status as the living head of the church, the church does not use the symbol of the Christian cross except on the uniforms of military chaplains. Instead, the church tends to focus on the belief that Jesus overcame suffering and death and that he lives today. =Holy Ghost= The Holy Ghost is regarded as \\"a being endowed with the attributes and powers of Deity and not a mere force or essence.\\" He testifies of the Father and the Son. \\"By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\" The Holy Ghost can sanctify people enabling them \\"to put off the natural man and [become] a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord\\". The Holy Ghost is the comforter that Jesus promised to send: \\"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever.\\" Plan of salvation The plan of salvation or gospel of Christ is a series of steps, a continuum, or means to come to God through the mediation of Jesus. It comprises those teachings of Christ which enable a mortal man or woman to overcome the fall of Adam and Eve in his or her life, and ultimately return to the presence of God, to enjoy the kind of life lived by God the Father, or, more succinctly, \\"exaltation\\", also known as \\"eternal life\\". The specific teachings include the fact that Adam and Eve fell, becoming subject to the temptations of the devil, bringing upon themselves and their posterity both physical death and spiritual death, separating themselves from God. As a remedy for Adam and Eve's predicament, consistent with God's nature and objective to produce divine heirs, God gave Adam and his posterity the moral agency and choice to either (1) follow and serve Christ, or (2) follow and serve Satan (). To overcome the lasting effects of the fall, Christ offered himself an infinite sacrifice for the sins of all those willing to repent and enter into a covenant with him, trusting in his righteousness or merits for salvation (; ), while all the rest must depend on their own good works for salvation, or answer the ends of the law themselves, falling short of the glory of God (; ). Furthermore, Christ brought about the universal resurrection of all men and women, as they were not responsible for the fall, leaving them to account only for their own deeds in the flesh (; ). Also, as the agent of the Father and judge of all, Christ is able to be both merciful and just (; ). To obtain his mercy, or be saved from his wrath on the day of judgment, men and women must (1) have faith in Christ, (2) repent of their sins, (3) be baptized by one of his authorized agents in water in the likeness of his burial, to come forth born again of the Spirit, (4) receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, again by an authorized servant of God bearing his priesthood, and (5) endure with faith in Christ and repentance from sins to the end of their mortal lives. The LDS Church teaches that this is the only gospel ever taught by Jesus, and that it is imparted in the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and most plainly in the Book of Mormon. (See also ; .) Multiple scriptural names for this limited and oft- repeated body of teachings are: gospel of Jesus Christ (), doctrine of Christ (), plan of salvation, plan of redemption (), words of eternal life (), gospel of repentance, gospel of baptism, gospel of salvation, good tidings ), our report (), gospel of the kingdom (), good tidings of great joy (), gospel of the grace of God (), gospel of peace (), \\"good news,\\" and other equivalent names. Once a man or woman has obeyed the first principles of the gospel, he or she must press forward, feasting on the words of Christ, going on to perfection through Christ (; ). The plan of salvation describes humanity's place in the universe and the purpose of life. The church teaches that there was a pre-mortal existence, a place which existed prior to mortality in which all people and all life were created in spirit form.; Central to this is the notion that humans existed as spirits before birth, were raised by Heavenly Parents and had essential human characteristics such as gender.. See also: The Family: A Proclamation to the WorldSmith. Doctrines of Salvation. vol. 1, p. 56general idea also expressed in During the pre-earth life, God the Father presented a plan to have a Savior make it possible for mankind to be saved. The purpose of an earth life was to give men the opportunity to demonstrate obedience to the commandments of God while outside of his presence. This is the central test of the evolution or eternal progression of man to godhood. Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior. However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God's glory, and human agency would be eliminated.See When God rejected that plan, the War in Heaven ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one- third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies. Lucifer became Satan, or the devil., briefly mentions the fall of Satan. The earth, according to church teachings in the temples, was created by Jehovah, which the church identifies as the pre-mortal Jesus, and Michael the archangel, who is identified as the pre-mortal Adam. The earth was \\"organized\\" from pre-existing matter,See as were other planets with their inhabitants. Michael's spirit was placed into his body which was created by God the Father and Jehovah, and became a living soul known as Adam. The church teaches that at birth, a pre-existing spirit enters a mortal body. Upon death, the spirit goes to a \\"spirit world\\" to await the resurrection of the dead. There, a preliminary judgment, based in part on whether a person has had a baptism by the authority of the priesthood and received their confirmation, either in this life or after death by proxy, places the spirit in either a state of paradise (has completed all the saving ordinances) or spirit prison (those who have not had the saving ordinances). Those in \\"prison\\" will be visited by spirits from paradise and given the chance to learn of the teachings of Jesus Christ and to accept the accompanying saving ordinances. The church teaches that all persons, wicked or righteous, will be resurrected and receive an immortal, physical body.See . The nature of that body, however, will depend on the result of the Last Judgment, at which Jesus will assign each soul to one of three degrees of glory (heavenly kingdoms): the celestial kingdom in the presence of the Father and the Son for those who accept Jesus Christ and receive all LDS saving ordinances, either as a mortal or by proxy; the terrestrial kingdom, a place of glory in the presence of Christ for righteous persons who refuse to receive the saving ordinances and for those who do not keep the covenants they commit to; and the telestial kingdom for the unrepentant wicked. A further destination, called outer darkness, is reserved for Satan, his devils, and those mortals who commit the unpardonable sin and thereby become the sons of perdition. Those who are ultimately destined for the telestial kingdom will be those who suffer for their sins in hell; however, these persons remain in hell only the 1000 years during the millennial reign of Christ, after which they will exit hell and be resurrected with an immortal body into a state of peace. The church also teaches that all animals have souls and, having been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, will be resurrected, along with every human child who died before the age of accountability. Those in the celestial kingdom will be allowed to continue to progress and become joint heirs with Jesus Christ; but only individuals that are in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom will eventually be enabled in eternity to become gods and goddesses and participate in the eternal creative process of having spirit children. Prayer The church encourages all people to pray often \\"for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.\\" In LDS scripture Jesus tells his disciples, \\"Ye shall call upon the Father in my name.\\" Prayer is viewed a means of communication between man and God. It is LDS belief that God hears the sincere prayers of all people because they are his children, he is no respecter of persons, and because he knows all things. God is to be approached in reverence. Except for certain ordinances the specific words of a prayer do not have a prescribed form. Generally, prayer is addressed to God the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, and thanks or petitions are expressed as prompted by the Holy Ghost.McConkie, Bruce R., Why the Lord Ordained Prayer, Prayer p.5-15 Deseret Book Company 1979 ed. The Priest has a scriptural duty \\"to exhort members to pray vocally and in secret.\\" LDS Children are taught to remove distractions while praying by doing such things as closing their eyes, and folding their arms, Reverence for deity can also be expressed while praying through folding arms, bowing the head, or kneeling. But prayer may be accomplished while standing or sitting. According to LDS theology, the First Vision came in answer to a prayer of faith. Revelation The church teaches that revelation from God continues today. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire church comes to the President of the Church; revelation to direct a stake comes to the stake president; for a ward, to the bishop of that ward; and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation and divine guidance in raising their families and managing their personal affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and general authorities speak when \\"moved upon by the Holy Ghost\\" ()Members are encouraged to listen carefully to general conference but also feel they can rely on personal revelation in order to appreciate validity of such statements (Joseph F. Smith, in Conference Report, April 1902; ). as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements. Family and gender marriage in the Manti Utah Temple =Family= The LDS Church has been characterized by its members as a family-centered religion. The church teaches that every being that lived upon the earth initially had a spirit body and that all were born to Heavenly Parents in a pre-mortal existence. The church teaches that on earth, families may be \\"sealed\\"‚Äîmeaning that they are eternally bound as husband‚Äìwife, parents‚Äìchild‚Äîand that these bonds will continue after death. Sealings can also include deceased ancestors, providing much of the church's rationale for its extensive family history activities. Members tend more often to be married, and have families with more children, than members of other Christian traditions. =Exaltation and marriage= In consequence of the atonement of Jesus Christ, a son or daughter of God the Father may overcome physical and spiritual death and return to live with God forever. Those individuals who receive this‚Äîwhich is described as the \\"greatest gift of God\\"‚Äîare said to enter into a state of \\"exaltation\\" after they are resurrected. Exaltation is also called \\"salvation\\" or \\"eternal life\\". Exaltation is \\"the kind of life God lives\\". In other words, exalted beings will live in great glory, be perfect, and possess all knowledge and wisdom. Exalted beings will live forever with God the Father and Jesus Christ, will become gods and goddesses, will live with their righteous earthly family members, and will receive the fulness of joy enjoyed by God and Christ. One of the key qualifications for exaltation is being united in a celestial marriage to an opposite-sex partner. Such a union can be created during mortality, or it can be created after death by proxy marriages; all such sealings, for the living or for the dead, are performed in temples. Humans who fall short of exaltation still receive an immortal physical body. Most will be awarded one of three kingdoms of glory, whether it be the celestial, terrestrial, or telestial kingdoms. Those who are exalted are said to inhabit the \\"highest degree\\" of the celestial kingdom. Satan, his spirit followers, and a select number of people who lived on the earth will receive no glory and will be called the sons of perdition. =Gender= The church also teaches that each person's gender is eternal and that each gender has roles and duties in the family that are ordained by God. The church teaches that \\"By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.\\" Some have characterized this view of the man- woman relationship as \\"equal but different\\". Nevertheless, LDS women in the United States work outside the home in about the same percentage as other American women. The church teaches that gender is inherently linked to sex, but the church has no official policy on the status of intersex persons. Persons who suffer from gender dysphoria are accepted in the church and may be baptized, but may not receive the priesthood or enter the temple if they are considering or have undergone elective gender reassignment surgery.Church Handbook of Instructions: Book 1, Stake Presidents and Bishoprics (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2006) p. 41, 78. Law of chastity The church teaches what it calls the law of chastity, a moral code that its members must follow to be in good standing with the church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits sexual relations between individuals who are not married, adultery, and sexual relations between gay and lesbian partners whether married or not. The law also prohibits other sexual behavior, such as bestiality and masturbation, as well as mental behavior such as lust, sexual fantasy, and viewing of pornography. The church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable sexual behavior between legally married couples.Some church leaders have taught that oral sex, anal sex and contraception are sinful, even as part of a marriage relationship, but there are no policies on these issues that are enforced in the church. On January 5, 1982, the First Presidency issued a statement to church leaders that stated that the First Presidency \\"has interpreted oral sex to constitute an unnatural, impure, or unholy practice\\". However, the statement also counseled church leaders to \\"scrupulously avoid\\" detailed inquiries into the sexual practices of married couples and emphasized that married couples \\"can determine by themselves\\" what is appropriate in their sexual relationship (. Sex in marriage is seen as a means for expressing and building joy, unity, love, and oneness, as well as for producing children. The church encourages members to enter into a celestial marriage, performed as a church ordinance in an LDS temple. This is the only form of marriage recognized by the church as a sacrament and \\"the only due and proper way of joining husband and wife\\".Heber J. Grant, J. Reuben Clark, Jr., David O. McKay (October 1942), \\"Parenthood: First Presidency Message\\", Conference Report, pp. 12-13. For purposes of the law of chastity, however, the church presently recognizes civil unions that are considered \\"legal and lawful\\" by the government where the legal agreement takes place. In the church's view, exceptions to the acceptance of civil unions include same-sex marriage, polygamous marriage, common law marriage, and other types of non-ceremonial marriages in non-common law countries.In the 19th century, the church performed illegal polygamous marriages, but that practice has been discontinued. The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy and modern entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, may result in excommunication (Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics (2006), p. 110). In countries where the celestial marriage ordinance is not recognized by the government, it must be preceded by a civil marriage. The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include standards of modesty in dress and action. Sexual activity outside of marriage may result in church discipline, including excommunication, in which a member loses his or her church membership and privileges but may continue to attend meetings.LDS Church, Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics, 2006, pp. 109‚Äì111. In most instances, the church strongly discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control among married couples.LDS Church, Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics, 2006, p. 188. LGBT members of the church are expected to keep the law of chastity.The church characterizes its church discipline policy as neutral regarding sexual orientation: ‚ÄúNow we have gays in the church. Good people. We take no action against such people‚Äîprovided they don‚Äôt become involved in transgression, sexual transgression. If they do, we do with them exactly what we‚Äôd do with heterosexuals who transgress\\" (). Nevertheless, according to the church handbook, repeated homosexual activities by adults, unlike repeated heterosexual extramarital sex, will result in an automatic annotation to a person's permanent membership record, which will follow them if they move to a new local congregation (Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics (2006), p. 147). Also, homosexual activity committed after the age of 16 will normally permanently bar a person from serving a mission for the church (Id., p. 94). If they do, they can ‚Äúgo forward as do all other members of the church.‚Äù If they desire to enter into a heterosexual marriage, they should first learn to deal with their homosexual feelings; otherwise, they must remain celibate. Gay or lesbian sex, in any form, whether the participants are married or not, may be grounds for excommunication. The church has supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and polygamous marriage in the United States and has stated that it \\"favors measures that define marriage as the union of one man and one woman and that do not confer legal status on any other sexual relationship.\\". The church's position is that government recognition of such rights will \\"undermine the divinely created institution of the family\\". The emphasis on the law of chastity leads to a lower rate of pre-marital sex among LDS youth than among their peers.; Ordinances and covenants Baptismal font in the Salt Lake Temple, circa 1912, where baptisms for the dead are performed by proxy. The font rests on the backs of twelve oxen representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel Latter-day Saint sacraments are called ordinances, of which there are two types: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. All ordinances, whether saving or non- saving, must be performed by a man ordained to the appropriate priesthood office, with the exception of certain parts of the temple endowment and the initiatory or washings and anointings, in which men and women are separated, and women administer the ordinances for women, and men administer the ordinances for men. However, both men and women must be \\"set apart\\", or authorized and \\"blessed by the laying on of hands\\" by those who have proper authority before serving as temple ordinance workers. Saving ordinances are those that are required for salvation or exaltation, and include baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost (confirmation of membership in the church of Jesus Christ); the \\"sacrament\\" of the Lord's supper, taken each Sunday, to keep in remembrance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to renew the covenants made at baptism; ordination to an office of the priesthood (for males); the initiatory or washings and anointings; the endowment; celestial marriage; and family sealings. Each saving ordinance is associated with one or more covenants that the person receiving the ordinance makes with God, and one or more blessing that God promises to the recipient. Three primary covenants are administered by the LDS Church under the heading ‚Äúnew and everlasting covenant,‚Äù called ‚Äúnew‚Äù because they have been restored again and ‚Äúeverlasting‚Äù because they are eternal with God.; ; Specifically, they are the baptismal covenant; the priesthood covenant; and the marriage covenant. Each covenant, or ‚Äúcontract,‚Äù between God and humans has one or more pre-requisites, offers one or more rewards, and specifies punishment for breaking it. The first, the baptismal covenant, is entered into after the sincere communicant fulfills the pre- requisite of exercising faith in Christ, repents of his sins, is baptized by proper authority, receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, and promises to endure to the end of his mortal life continuing to exercise faith in Christ and repentance from his sins. He also agrees to stand as a witness for Christ at all times and in all places, and bear the burdens of his fellow servants . The scriptures are replete with references to all these gospel elements (). The covenant maker receives the reward of the gift of the Holy Ghost, receives membership in the Church of Jesus Christ, receives forgiveness of sins, peace of conscience, a rebirth of the Spirit (; ; ), grace, a hope in Christ, salvation or eternal life, and the joy of the saints.; ; ; ; ; The punishment for breaking the covenant is perdition (). The sacrament of the Lord‚Äôs supper, or partaking of bread and wine instituted by Jesus, is in remembrance of this covenant, in remembrance of his blood, or atonement for sins, and the resurrection of his body.; ; ; ; ; ; Latter-day Saints believe the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a God of covenants.; ; ; ; ; ; ; In return for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob‚Äôs faith and obedience, God promised them (1) a numberless posterity, (2) a chosen land, and (3) the blessing of all nations through their posterity and the priesthood of their posterity, the ‚Äúblessings of heaven.‚Äù; ; ; God promised Jacob‚Äôs son, Joseph, additional blessings, a special land and a righteous branch to be separated from the rest of the house of Israel (; ). Even later, promises and assurances were given through Moses and other prophets that, even though all Israel should be scattered and many persecuted, the earlier promises would not be forgotten, and a day of restoration and gathering would come in which all the tribes of Israel would be united in peace under the Lord. The Book of Mormon is said to be a witness to the truth of these promises, and it is an assurance that more of them will not be left unfulfilled.Title Page, Book of Mormon; ; ; ; The church teaches there are three rewards or degrees of glory in the heavenly world (; ; ), and that to obtain the highest degree of salvation (referred to as \\"exaltation\\" in the celestial kingdom), all people who have lived to the age of eight must participate in each of the saving ordinances. However, the church teaches that they may be performed for a person either during their lifetime or by proxy after the person has died. Therefore, church members participate in the saving ordinances on behalf of dead relatives and others whose names have been extracted from historical records. The performance of these proxy ordinances are one of the functions of the church's temples. All the saving ordinances are currently open to all worthy church members of the appropriate age. Prior to 1978, black members were restricted from receiving the priesthood and from all ordinances performed in temples. Celestial marriage is open to one man and one woman at a time, but a man whose spouse has died may enter a second celestial marriage. Apart from sealings to parents, the church does not perform saving ordinances for those younger than age eight or for those who have died before the age of eight (when children reach the \\"age of accountability\\"), because young children are deemed \\"alive in Christ\\" and not responsible for sin.; Likewise, the church teaches that the saving ordinances are not required for persons age eight or older who are \\"mentally incapable of knowing right and wrong\\". These individuals are saved by the grace and mercy of Christ without baptism and will inherit the celestial kingdom of God. Non- saving ordinances include the dedication of graves, the dedication of buildings, the prayer circle, the hosanna shout, shaking the dust from the feet, and various kinds of blessings, including the patriarchal blessing. Structure and practices Leadership and hierarchy The leader of the church is the President of the Church, and church members regard him as a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is often referred to by members of the church as \\"the Prophet\\" because the president is thought to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets. The president's responsibility is primarily over the church as a whole. Church members believe his stewardship also extends to all humanity as the Lord's chosen mouthpiece. He is entitled to guide the church through revelation, acting as God's spokesman. After the death of church president, Thomas S. Monson, on January 2, 2018, Russell M. Nelson was sustained and set apart as the current president on January 14, 2018. The First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Presiding Bishopric and the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy are all referred to as general authorities because they direct the work of the entire church throughout the world. The members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are accepted by the church as prophets, seers, and revelators. All apostles serve in their positions until death; other general authorities are released from their service. Other church authorities are referred to as \\"area authorities\\" and \\"local authorities\\" and include all other Quorums of the Seventy, mission presidents, temple presidents, stake presidents, bishops, and other priesthood quorum presidents. The church has no salaried ministry; however, some general authorities receive stipends from the church, as needed, using income from church-owned investments. All local and area authorities are unpaid and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions. Although the church had a paid local clergy in the 1800s, local and regional priesthood leaders currently serve as volunteers. Non-clerical church employees, general authorities (who serve life or five-year terms), and mission presidents are paid a stipend from church funds and provided other benefits. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single Mormon missionaries. Missionaries and their families are asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary's congregation of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.  Service hierarchy  The church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are \\"called\\" by someone of a higher authority in the church. The status of women in church leadership has remained largely unchanged since the early 1900s. Although they are not ordained to the priesthood, preaching and instruction by women is an integral part of weekly Latter-day Saint worship. Certain leadership positions are filled only by women, and in some of the church's auxiliary organizations women may preside over men. Since the 1840s, women have officiated in certain ordinances that take place inside temples. =Priesthood= The priesthood is offered to all male members ages 12 and older who follow the church's code of ethics, morality and behavior. Men receive the priesthood by ordination, which consists of other priesthood holders laying their hands on their head. Ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to preside in the church. The priesthood is structured in a hierarchical manner, emphasizing obedience. Members are encouraged to avoid public criticism of priesthood leaders; repeated public criticism by an individual may eventually result in excommunication. Aaronic priesthood There is one priesthood with two levels; within each are different offices. The first level is the Aaronic Priesthood given to young men ages 12‚Äì17. The first office in this priesthood level is called a deacon; males aged 12 and 13 are ordained to this office. Their primary duty is to pass the sacrament to members on Sundays and collect fast offerings. Teacher is the second office and is given to males ages 14 and 15. The primary duties of teachers are to prepare the sacrament, participate in home teaching, and assist members with their temporal needs if requested. Priest is the third office in the Aaronic priesthood; this office given the males ages 16 and older. The primary duties of a priest is to bless the sacrament and participate in home teaching. Priests also have the authority to baptize individuals who choose to become members of the church. A priest can also confer the Aaronic priesthood or ordain others to the office of deacon, teacher, or priest. Bishop is the highest office of the Aaronic Priesthood. A bishop must also be a high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood. A bishop's responsibility is to preside over a local group of Aaronic priesthood members and to act as the presiding high priest over a church congregation. Melchizedek Priesthood The second level of the priesthood is the Melchizedek priesthood. All Melchizedek priesthood holders are 18 or older but the offices do not have set ages for progression. The first office is elder. An elder may confer the gift of the Holy Ghost; give blessings by the laying on of hands; ordain other elders; and perform any duty given to priests of the Aaronic priesthood. A second office is high priest. A high priest is responsible for the spiritual welfare of their congregation of saints; may serve in a bishopric, stake presidency, high council, or temple presidency and may serve as a mission president. Further, he may ordain other high priests and elders; and can perform all the duties of both elder and Aaronic priesthood holders. Bishops, stake presidents, members of a stake high council, mission presidents, temple presidents, and members of the First Presidency must be ordained high priests. A third office is patriarch. A patriarch's main responsibility is to provide patriarchal blessings for members of a stake or district (a geographic region of multiple congregations) and to declare an individual's lineage. A fourth office is seventy. Those who hold this office are especial witnesses of Christ who assist the apostles in the administration of the church worldwide and in the church's areas. Each seventy is usually given a specific responsibility for a particular region. The highest office of the Melchizedek priesthood is apostle. This office is reserved for members of the Quorum of the Twelves Apostles and members of the First Presidency. The main role of an apostle is to act as a special witness of Jesus Christ to the world at large and to oversee the spiritual and temporal administration of the church. The President of the Church is the person in the church who has been an ordained apostle for the longest period of time. =Auxiliary organizations= Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: Relief Society, Young Men organization, Young Women organization, Primary, and Sunday School. The Relief Society is the church's women's organization. Founded in 1842 in Nauvoo, Illinois, and with the motto \\"Charity Never Faileth\\", the organization today includes more than 5.5 million women in over 170 countries. Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society. The Young Men and Young Women organizations are composed of adolescents aged 12 to 18. Members often have an additional meeting during the week (referred to as Mutual), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in a combined activities. In the United States and Canada, the young men participate in Scouting, including efforts to earn the Boy Scouts religious award for church members, \\"On my Honor.\\" Young men throughout the church also work toward earning the church's \\"Duty to God\\" award. Young women participate in a comparable program called Personal Progress. Both the young men and the young women are encouraged to live by the standards outlined in the church's \\"For the Strength of Youth\\" booklet. The Primary is an organization for children up to age 12, founded in 1878. It provides classes, music, and activities for children during the second hour of the Sunday meeting schedule. The LDS Sunday School organization provides classes for adolescents and adults during the second hour of the Sunday meeting schedule. It provides a variety of classes, including introductory classes for new members and nonmembers, and gospel doctrine classes for more experienced members. Adolescents are grouped into classes by age.  Duties and expectations of church members  For members of the church, the greatest commandment is to love God with all their heart and the second is to love others as they love themselves. All other commandments are considered appendages to these great commandments (). Members are encouraged to pray several times a day, to perform good works, and to read scriptures daily. Members are expected to donate their time, money, and talents to the church, and those who have participated in the endowment ceremony make an oath to donate all that they have, if required of them, to the Lord. To be in good standing and to enter the church's temples, church members are asked to tithe their income to the church, which is officially interpreted as 10 percent of annual income. In addition, members are invited to donate monthly charitable \\"fast offerings\\" (at least the equivalent cost of two meals), which are used to help the poor and needy in the community; members are also encouraged to make other humanitarian donations through the church. Members who have participated in the temple endowment ceremony are expected to wear a temple garment under their clothing at all times. Members are told that they should not partially or completely remove the garment to participate in activities that can \\"reasonably be done with the garment worn properly beneath the clothing\\". When necessary, the garment may be temporarily removed, but members are told that after the activity they should put it back on as soon as possible. Swimming is given as an example of an activity that would justify removal of the garment. In addition to attending the weekly three-hour church services, members are usually given \\"callings\\" or assignments in the church, and often attend various other meetings or activities throughout the week relating to that calling. Members in good standing are assigned to visit the homes of other members monthly as \\"home teachers\\" (men) or \\"visiting teachers\\" (women). Members are also expected to engage in missionary work, family history research, to conduct a Family Home Evening weekly with their family, and to attend the temple regularly. Church members are encouraged to live self-sufficiently and avoid unnecessary debt. All male members are expected to serve a two-year mission sometime during the ages of 18‚Äì26 after they have finished high school or its equivalent, though there are high standards of worthiness and physical and mental health that prohibit many men from serving. Women may optionally serve an 18-month mission if they are at least 19 years old. In addition to single men and women, retired married couples may also choose to serve a mission. Good standing in the church requires that members follow the \\"Word of Wisdom\\",, originally a strong recommendation, but adopted as a requirement by Brigham Young in 1851. a health code given by Joseph Smith which the church interprets as requiring abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and recreational drugs). Members must also obey the law of chastity and are strongly counseled against choosing an elective abortion, except in the cases of a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, a pregnancy that seriously jeopardizes the life or health of the mother, or a pregnancy where a physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1:Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics, 2006, p. 185. In general, members are encouraged obey the law of the country in which they live, although there have been notable exceptions.For example, until 1890, the church advocated civil disobedience to U.S. anti-polygamy laws. The church discourages gambling in all forms, including lotteries. Church members who commit what are considered serious violations of the standards of the church (defined as, without limitation, \\"attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, spouse abuse, intentional serious physical injury of others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations, deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, sale of illegal drugs, fraud, perjury, and false swearing\\")Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics (2006), p. 110. may be subject to church disciplinary action, including disfellowshipment or excommunication. Such individuals are encouraged to continue attending church services, but are not permitted to hold church responsibilities or offer public prayer or sermons at any church meeting (although personal prayer is encouraged); excommunicated members are also prohibited from paying tithing or fast offerings. Such matters are generally kept private and other members are therefore frequently unaware of the status of such individuals. Everyone is welcome to attend the public meetings of the church, whether or not they adhere to the church's lifestyle code. Church members are permitted to think or believe freely on any issue, but are discouraged from publicly criticizing local leaders or general authorities; repeated public criticism of the church or its leaders may subject a person to church discipline for apostasy. The church maintains a Strengthening Church Members Committee which monitors members' publications and refers critical material to local authorities for possible disciplinary action. Finances The Church Administration Building with the LDS Church Office Building tower in the background Church funds are used to construct and maintain buildings and other facilities; provide for the administrative needs of local church units; provide social welfare and relief; and to support missionary, educational, and other church-sponsored programs. The church has also invested in business and real estate ventures such as Bonneville International, Deseret Book Company, and cattle ranches in Utah, Florida, and Canada. The church receives most of its money from tithes and fast offerings. About ten percent of its funding also comes from income on investments and real estate holdings. The church has not released church-wide financial statements since 1959, but in 1997 Time called it one of the world's wealthiest churches per capita. Its for-profit, non-profit, and educational subsidiary entities are audited by an independent accounting firm: , Deloitte & Touche.Belo Corp Form 8-K. Accessed May 16, 2007. \\"Financial Planning\\". finserve.byu.edu. Accessed May 16, 2007.  Organized worship and participation  The church provides several kinds of services and gatherings for participation by members and non-members, including weekly services on Sunday, periodic conferences such as the bi-annual general conference, and ritual services at the church's temples (for members only). All persons, regardless of their beliefs or standing in or out of the church, are welcome to attend non-temple church services and conferences. Women usually attend worship services wearing skirts or dresses, while men typically wear suits or dress shirts and ties. Children are also typically in their \\"Sunday best.\\" Interior of the LDS Conference Center where the Church holds its semi-annual General Conference. The church holds its normal worship services on SundayServices may be held on a different day when Sunday worship is prohibited by law. during a three-hour block composed of three meetings: sacrament meeting, which features the church's weekly sacrament ritual and sermons by various selected members; Sunday School, featuring a lesson on various scriptural topics; and finally, each participant is assigned a meeting based on their age and sex, which could include a meeting of priesthood holders for males aged 12 and up separated into age-specific quorums, Relief Society for adult women, and a meeting of the Young Women organization for adolescent females. During the second hour, children under age 12 participate in activities of the Primary. Periodically, members participate in local, regional, and general church-wide conferences in lieu of Sunday services. General conference is broadcast semi-annually (April and October) from Salt Lake City, Utah. Puerto Princesa, Philippines The church also provides ritual services at its temples, which are open only to members of the appropriate age who meet standards of orthodoxy and worthiness. Members are encouraged to attend the temples regularly, where they usually participate in the endowment, sealing, washing and anointing, and other ordinances, most often by proxy for the dead. Programs = Missionary program= Young men between the ages of 18 and 25 who meet standards of worthiness and preparation are encouraged to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission. Women who desire to serve a mission must be at least 19 and generally serve 18-month missions. Retired married couples are encouraged to serve missions as well, and their length of service varies from three to 36 months. there were 405 missions and approximately 83,000 full-time proselytizing missionaries serving throughout the world. In addition, about 8,500 missionaries are on special assignment missions, serving as health care specialists, doctors, craftsmen, artisans, construction supervisors, agricultural experts and educators for developing countries and educators, family history researchers and leadership trainers. In June 2007, the church marked the induction of its one millionth missionary since 1830. =Educational System= Latter-day Saints believe in the value of education. Joseph Smith taught that \\"the glory of God is intelligence.\\" Accordingly, the church maintains Brigham Young University, Brigham Young University‚ÄìIdaho, Brigham Young University‚ÄìHawaii, and LDS Business College. The church also has religious education programs. Seminary is a program for secondary school students held daily in conjunction with the school year. The Institute of Religion and the LDS Student Association programs serve young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in post-secondary education institutions with church-owned buildings near university and college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization. In addition, the church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the Perpetual Education Fund. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from developing countries who have served a mission, returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries. As they finish their education and enter the work force, they then are able to pay back the funds provided so that other individuals can attend both vocational technical schools and university. =Welfare Program= Members of the church donate fast offerings on Fast Sunday and at other times for the purpose of helping those who are poor or financially struggling. The bishop will meet with a family, or the head(s) of a family to determine whether and how much help they need from the church. The church strongly encourages its members to be self- reliant, so these meetings will usually include a plan on how to get the family back on its own feet. This welfare program is not only available to members of the church, but to any needy members of the community. On a general church scale, the church engages in humanitarian efforts which provides money and supplies to assist victims of natural disasters. All of these services are paid for by charitable donations and are run by volunteer workers. $104.9 million of aid was given in 2007. there are 8,500 welfare service missionaries serving in the church. =Priesthood Correlation Program=  Publications  The church also publishes several official periodicals, including the Ensign (for English-speaking adults), the Liahona (non-English languages),The Liahona is currently published in over 50 languages. Material for adults, youth, and children is included in each edition. the New Era (for youth), and the Friend (for children). Some older, discontinued English-language publications produced or affiliated with the church included Evening and Morning Star (1833‚Äì34), Messenger and Advocate (1834‚Äì37), Elders' Journal (1837), Times and Seasons (1839‚Äì46), Millennial Star (1840‚Äì1970), The Seer (1853‚Äì54), Journal of Discourses (1854‚Äì86), The Juvenile Instructor (1866‚Äì1930), Woman's Exponent (1872‚Äì1914), The Contributor (1879‚Äì96), Young Woman's Journal (1889‚Äì1929), Improvement Era (1897‚Äì1970), The Children's Friend (1902‚Äì70), Relief Society Magazine (1915‚Äì70), and The Instructor (1930‚Äì70).

The management of CSLP is overseen by the Board of Directors which consists of state representatives or librarians from participating libraries who plan, communicate and coordinate all operations. The mission statement of the CSLP is to \\"empower libraries to foster community\\". Today, the CSLP is a consortium of libraries with representation from all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa and the Mariana Islands working together to share and develop high-quality programs for children, teens and adults. The Collaborative Summer Library Program provides program materials, artwork and technical expertise in the form of a manual that membership libraries can order to help create meaningful and exciting experiences during the summer. Its current office is in Mason City, Iowa.  History  CSLP began in 1987 with ten Minnesota regional library systems that joined together to create a theme, artwork and program ideas for libraries to use for children's programming. By combining resources and collaborating with a commercial vendor, the libraries were able to provide cheaper, higher-quality resources to promote child and teen reading during the summer.  Summer Reading Programs in Libraries  Many public libraries offer summer reading programs for teens and children in coordination with local school districts. These reading programs can contain events that are art or craft related, technology based or science related. Many of the programs help children and teens develop STEM or STEAM skills as well as encourage reading with summer reading lists or programs about books. Events like this can include computer programs on office software, robotics, coding or other events like science camps. Many libraries also help children and teens develop important life skills with programs about sewing, knitting, cooking and art. According to Bertin 2004 a study by the U. S. Department of Education found that 95% of all public libraries offered a summer reading program. These programs are used to prevent summer learning loss. Children's programs in libraries began around the turn of the century beginning with the Cleveland Library League in 1895. For more information about the early development of children‚Äôs librarianship see McDowell 1995. Early reading programs focused on the quality of the books and contained required reading, but newer education trends focus on breadth of reading to create an ‚Äúavid reader,‚Äù as is discussed in The Enduring Effects of Education by Herbert H. Hyman, Charles R. Wright and John Shelton Reed.  The Official Summer Reading Program  The Collaborative Summer Reading Program provides an extensive manual of program and promotional ideas to participating public libraries. This includes artwork such as logos and program scripts with supply lists for activities and crafts. Presenting the Summer Reading Program is a large undertaking for many public libraries. It often entails coordinating with the local school district to market and encourage student participation. In addition, a majority of a library's program numbers are gained during the summer months. Libraries rely on the content created in the CSLP manual to be able to offer numerous programs and classes, sometimes daily, for children and teens over the summer. This low cost program is now something that the majority of public libraries offer and this would not be possible without the help from CSLP. This program encourages children to continue learning while not in school; it is free, easy, and fun for all involved. The American Library Association recognizes the importance of this and its website states that they provide a grant for public libraries in order for them to afford this program and offer it to all their patrons for free. In addition, Baker & Taylor offers the Summer Reading Program Grant for up to three thousand dollars to assist libraries in purchasing this program. It also recognizes ALSC (Association for Library Service to Children) libraries and their employees for the outstanding development of the program. Summer reading programs are tailored to different age groups (early literacy, children, teens and adults) and promote literacy and community in a fun way. Each summer a theme is picked and content is created around this theme that libraries can use. Depending on the age group, different skills are highlighted. The early literacy program helps young children build reading and language skills by fostering a love of reading and building confidence in children surrounding books and the library. It also offers resources for infants, toddlers and preschoolers. The children's program helps prepare students in developing early language skills and helps maintain reading during the summer vacation. It also promotes working cooperatively and furthers their sense of discovery. In many areas, the public library is the only place during the summer where children can access free educational resources and enrichment activities. The teen program works to motivate students to read and learn how to discuss literature. The activities helps promote reading comprehension, which is often a component on standardized tests, and is necessary for higher education and employment. Added in 2009, the adult summer reading program offers a variety of ways for adults to pursue the enjoyment of reading. It also offers ideas for serving senior citizens in care facilities or nursing homes.

Founded in 1993, Hellas Online (hol) was one of the first Internet service providers in Greece offering public dial-up Internet access. It evolved from an ISP to a fixed-line telecommunications services provider offering a broad range of retail, business and wholesale services. Since 2006 it became a member of the Intracom Holdings group. Before its dissolution, following its merger, with Vodafone in 2014, it had 531,563 LLU subscribers.http://www.hol.gr/press-release/71510/hellas-online-oikonomika- apotelesmata-examinoy-2014-leitoyrgiki-kerdoforia-sta/ History Hellas Online was founded in 1993Hellas On-Line History offering dial-up services in the Athens metropolitan area. The dial-up service was then expanded to the rest of Greece using low-toll telephone numbers. In 2006 it was acquired by Intracom and expanded its services to include broadband ADSL and SHDSL services. In 2007 it acquired 100% of Attica Telecom, the largest provider of fiber-optic services in the city of Athens and in June of the same year established a strategic partnership with Vodafone Greece. In June 2008, Hellas Online merged with Unibrain, a company listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, and became enlisted under the name Hellas Online (HOL). Network Hellas Online owns and operates a fibre optic network of approximately 3,500 kilometres (November, 2008). Its core backbone network is the second largest network in Greece after that of OTE, the incumbent operator. Through its points of presence (PoPs) consisting of physical co-location in unbundled local loops (LLUs) Hellas Online offers extensive population coverage in the metropolitan areas of the two largest cities in Greece, Athens (over 80%) and Thessaloniki (over 70%), and significant population coverage in the rest of Greece. Hellas Online's extensive proprietary fibre optic network connects the three major Greek cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, and Patras, and covers significant parts of the most densely populated areas of Greece. Hellas Online's network provides high-capacity connection between its data centres and sites, thus allowing Hellas Online to backhaul high bandwidth cost- effectively to its unbundled local loops, without having to lease capacity from OTE, while in certain cases, enabling Hellas Online to lease its own spare capacity to other Greek or international telecommunications operators. Services Hellas Online offers domestic and corporate clients, a complete range of broadband products, comprising internet services, fixed-telephony services, and a combination of the two. In 2009, Hellas launched an IPTV service, featuring access to free-to-air channels, news, information, music, children's and sports drawn from around the world and HD content.http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/03/10/hellas-launches-iptv- platform/ External links * Hellas Online References Category:Internet service providers of Greece Category:Companies listed on the Athens Exchange Category:Companies established in 1993 Category:Greek brands ","title":"Hellas Online"},{"id":"17755828","text":"How to Make a Mega Movie Deal was an attraction formerly located at Universal Studios Florida.

Voidokilia Beach (, ) is a popular beach in Messinia in the Mediterranean area. In the shape of the Greek letter omega (Œ©), its sand forms a semicircular strip of dunes. On the land-facing side of the strip of dunes is Gialova Lagoon, an important bird habitat. The beach has been named \\"A Place of Particular Natural Beauty\\". It is part of a Natura 2000 protected area.GR 2550004, Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public WorksGR 2550004, Natura 2000 History and myth Above the beach is Nestor's Cave and above this are the ruins of thirteenth-century Frankish castle (Old Navarino or Palaiokastro). Overlooking the beach at the north eastern end is the tomb of Nestor's son, Thrasymedes of the Mycenaean period (1680‚Äì1060 BC) with Neolithic finds at the same site showing occupation as early as 4000 BC.Ministry of Culture on-site notice. The beach is presumed to be Homer's \\"sandy Pylos\\" where Telemachus was welcomed by King Nestor when searching for his father, Odysseus. According to myth, Nestor's Cave is where Hermes hid the cattle stolen from Apollo. Location A hiking route begins from Voidokoilia. The climb towards Nestor's Cave begins at the south-west end of the beach, while after the cave the route continues towards Paliokastro. Voidokilia is next to Petrohori in Messinia, Greece. Though the ruins are not fenced off, the castle ruins are sign-posted as closed and tourists walk through the castle or around the walls at their own risk. Gialova's aquatic habitat, being an important stop for a variety of migratory birds, has been declared the southernmost Habitat of National Importance in the Balkans. It is considered a protected area hosting 258 species of birds out of which the 79 are included in the \\"Red Book\\" (species under threat of extinction). Parking for the beach is reached by sand tracks either from the Gialova Lagoon parking area (also used by bird-watchers) or by following the Northside route from Petrochori. The beach is considered friendly for naturists and gay tourists. Archaeology To the south of the beach stretches cape Koryphasion, where stood the classical city of Pylos. Nowadays very few remains of the city are still extant, as in the 13th century Nicholas de Saint'Omer built a castle on the top of the cape using the extant building material consisting of the ancient stones. Beneath the castle a triangular opening on the rock, visible from Voidokoilia, marks the Cave of Nestor, where, according to mythology Hermes had hidden the stolen oxen of Helios, whereas according to Pausanias (36.2) it was the place where were kept the cattle of the king Neleus. The cave has been archaeologically investigated in various periods, starting from H Schliemann in 1874 and continuing with the research by Laucent and Kourouniotis in the beginning of the 20th century, C. Blegen and W Mc Donald, Sp. Marinatos in the 1950s and finally G. Korres and A. Samson in the 1980s. It has yielded finds dating from the Final Neolithic period down to the Late Helladic period as well as some later, classical and early Hellenistic traces. The dimensions of the cave are 20x16 with a heigh which reaches 30 meters. The tomb of Thrasymedes, on the other hand, has been excavated by Sp. Marinatos in the 1950s and by G.S. Korres in the 1970s, since the latter noticed a pithos burial which had not been recorded by his predecessor. The tholos is 5 meters wide and its floor is covered with pebbles. It contained about 7 burials. Among the movable finds of the (otherwise looted in the past) tomb count arrow heads, necklaces made of carnelian and amethyst, two Mycenaean pottery vessels etc. The first use of the tumulus (pithos burials' phase) dates to the Middle Helladic Period whereas the prime time of the tholos tomb was the Mycenaean period. Around the tomb were found Late Classical and Hellenistic votive tablets as well as a small model of an altar, which points to some kind of hero or ancestors' cult.

Early history In an interview with Craig Regala and Tony Barnett of Moo Magazine, Be Hussey stated, ‚ÄúMorsel began in October 1991 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We recorded our first real demo released on cassette format in March 1992 (the G.I.B.L.E.T. ep) . . . We began with the intention of doing something different. There is no use in rehashing the past for the band as well as the listener. Inherent in this is an honest approach, and that comes through in our live show, which, by the way, is much better than our CDs (moo, September '96 - issue 25).‚Äù In that same interview, vocalist-flautist Miriam Cabrera elaborated, ‚ÄúWe wanted to do something original and interesting, but we never sat down and said ‚ÄòOkay, this is what we want to sound like.‚Äô It wasn't contrived. We definitely did a lot of jamming to see what would come out. The music we play is result of working on refining and melding what we're each inclined to do as individual musicians. The ‚Äòsound‚Äô came first, then we realized what it was, and now we work on developing it (moo, September '96 - issue 25).‚Äù The band's sound and presentation tended to lump them into an avant garde category shared by other \\"noise-oriented\\" bands who may or may not have shared Morsel's instrumental abilities. Hussey revealed in the Moo interview that ‚ÄúMiriam runs her flute through a ‚ÄòLeslie‚Äô cabinet (rotating horn), and she sings through her flute microphone. Many people freak on that. People focus on it a bit too much to the point of it possibly becoming a gimmick. People who write about bands need to focus on something, and that is usually the thing. We certainly don't use it as a gimmick; we simply increase the potential of creating new and interesting sounds by introducing new elements (moo, September '96 - issue 25).‚Äù It had also been noted that Cabrera was known to \\"use a buzz-saw for additional noise texture (Cicero's, November '95).\\" Alan Goldsmith described Morsel‚Äôs 1992 G.I.B.L.E.T. EP as ‚Äúanthem rock on an almost operatic scale, with a demonic choir, shifts in intensity, blasting wall-of-sound guitars, and a complexity rarely seen on a local level (Ann Arbor Current-Entertainment Monthly, February 1993).‚Äù The Ann Arbor News also focused on the band's eccentricities stating, ‚ÄúCabrera sings into the blow hole of her flute. The amplified result is a strange, angry shriek that sounds powerful and doomed at the same time (The Ann Arbor News New Releases 24 April 1993).‚Äù Choke Records Morsel \\"signed to Choke, Inc. Records of Chicago in the summer of 1993\\" . . . booking \\"time in February 1994 with Steve Albini to record Noise Floor, released in April '94 (moo, September '96 - issue 25).‚Äù Dave Segal wrote, ‚ÄúMorsel deal in hyper kinetic post-punk-prog-rock, with fractured funk moves thrown into the pot as an almost ironic gesture. The ten songs on Noise Floor are marked by frayed guitar textures, frequent fluid time changes, and a female voice filtered through the blow hole of a flute, for a warped alien effect that Chrome exploited so well. Sometimes Morsel seem to be playing it straight, even approaching a conventional low-key, indie-rock beauty. But then they'll abruptly scrunch up the rhythm, play crazy staccato riffs, pause unexpectedly, sing like Satan's sister . . . those kinds of things (Alternative Press August 1994).‚Äù Johnny Pecorelli said ‚ÄúMorsel's Steve Albini-produced debut, Noise Floor, should raise a few eyebrows itself. Sometimes melodic, sometimes atonal, sometimes full-on noise, the band makes use of everything from buzzsaws to flutes, trumpets and lilting guitar riffs. Singer Miriam Cabrera wails through primitive rotophasers; bassist Be Hussey tunes down to low D (for added evil); while Hedge spins out effects-drenched arpeggios from Mars. All this and a sense of dynamics solidified by drummer Brian Boulter which is downright schizophrenic (Alternative Press).‚Äù In his ‚ÄúLocal Music: The Best of ‚Äò94,‚Äù Agenda contributor Alan Goldsmith wrote, ‚ÄúRaw but melodic, symphonic yet garage band. Morsel and the music they've produced is awash in contradictions, like all great art. This release, produced by producer-GOD Steve Albini (whose credits include Nirvana), is spaced-out mind music that is best heard with open ears. It's rock and roll taken to an intense other level. Computer-processed roaming vocals, guitars that sound like acid flashbacks, but with a (for lack of a better word) symphony-like musical structure, Morsel is like a grunge, non-smartass Frank Zappa with their smaller sense of music theory complexity. While all this sounds academic on paper - it isn't. It's poetic and wonderful rock and roll that takes risks (Agenda, 1995).‚Äù After its release, the band toured extensively across the United States. In 1995, they recorded a follow-up EP at Ann Arbor's 40 Oz Sound with new guitarist Geoff Streadwick engineering. On the eve of the release, the label folded. Small Stone Records In late 1995, Morsel signed on with Detroit's Small Stone Records. Hussey explained Morsel's transition from Choke, Inc. to Small Stone Records in the moo interview: ‚ÄúThis EP was to be released in the Fall of '95 . . . Choke collapsed . . . The EP was released instead on Detroit's Small Stone label in April '96. Meanwhile, a new guitarist and drummer were added and touring commenced during the fall of '95 . . . (moo magazine, September '96 - issue 25).‚Äù Scott Hamilton said, ‚ÄúI did this compilation called Detroit Rust City. Half of the bands I picked were bands I really loved, like Morsel and Perplexa, from that Ann Arbor hipster scene (The Record, March 2007 Vol. I, Issue III).‚Äù Todd Spencer wrote in his ‚ÄúAmplified Notions‚Äù column, ‚ÄúMorsel has released a song called ‚ÄòGlangkoon‚Äô on a split 7\\" single on Dayton, Ohio's Simple Solution Records. ‚ÄòGlangkoon‚Äô is their first recorded effort with Geoff Streadwick, a local guitarist they acquired last summer. It does sound different than ‚ÄòNoise Floor,‚Äô their Choke Records full-length of a year ago, when they had current Wig frontman (Clark S. Nova being his latest pseudonym) playing guitar. The new single was recorded at Geoff's Ann Arbor studio, 40 oz. Sound (Ann Arbor Current- Entertainment Monthly, July 1995).‚Äù Since then, the band has released three full length records, a remix record, an EP, and a handful of singles. From the period of 1995-2001, they toured extensively across the United States.

From 1969 to 1978, he became the founder and leader of the ensemble Formacja Muzyki Wsp√≥≈Çczesnej (Contemporary Music Formation), famous for performing contemporary jazz and European avantgarde music, and they travelled across the Western world. He established himself as a theatrical composer, working together with directors such as Mieczys≈Çaw Kotlarczyk, Zygmunt H√ºbner, Adam Hanuszkiewicz, Jerzy Gruza and Erwin Axer, and writes film music for Jerzy Passendorfer, Janusz Morgenstern (Polskie drogi 1976), Ryszard Ber (Lalka 1977, Droga, Domy z deszczu), Janusz Majewski (Sublokator, Lekcja martwego jƒôzyka), Zbiegniew Ku≈∫mi≈Ñski (Nad Niemnem), and Janusz Zaorski, (Panny i Wdowy).

The film's title is a bilingual pun intentionally meant to sound like \\"Faut r√™ver Mozart\\" (\\"Dream Mozart, dream\\" in French).For Ever Mozart Review by Jonathan Rosenbaum) The film was selected as the Swiss entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  Plot  The film is divided into four parts, which Godard has subsequently given by name.  Theater  In the first part, Vicky Vitalis, an elderly film director, is casting a new project called \\"Fatal Bolero,\\" assisted by his nephew, J√©r√¥me. A group of actors lines up to audition, but Vicky is dissatisfied with each of their line readings. The director nevertheless manages to secure funding from a man called Baron Felix, who himself secures one of the actresses named Sabine, to the chagrin of Sabine's plaintive boyfriend. Later, J√©r√¥me accompanies Vicky's daughter, Camille, a professor of philosophy, as she searches for a copy of The Game of Love and Chance, the play by Pierre de Marivaux. Her intention is to stage the play in war torn Sarajevo. However, unable to find a copy, she settles instead on the Alfred de Musset play One Must Not Trifle with Love, happily noting that she shares the same name as the play's heroine. J√©r√¥me, smitten with his cousin, decides to go to Sarajevo with her, to his mother Sylvie's dismay. Sylvie persuades her brother Vicky to accompany them, and the family's maid, Jamila, also decides to go. Camille and J√©r√¥me decide to cast Jamila in the play as the character Rosette.  One Must Not Trifle with Love in Sarajevo  In the second part, the four take a train to Bosnia and rough it in the wild. Increasingly unable to share in his young charges' idealism, Vicky abandons them, filling the role of a West European who turns his back on the horrors of the Bosnian war. The spectre of tanks begins to appear in the forest, and not long after, Camille, J√©r√¥me, and Jamila are captured by Serbian paramilitaries and taken to a derelict mansion the paramilitaries are using as a base. There, Camille and J√©r√¥me metaphorically dig their own graves when they correct a Serbian commander on his account of Georges Danton's participation in the French Revolution. After being anally violated, they are forced to literally dig their own graves, and are killed in an ensuing attack on the base. Jamila, and a soldier having taken a liking to her, escape.  The Film of Disquiet  The third part sees Vicky working on \\"Fatal Bolero\\" by the seaside. Baron Felix, the film's financier, holds court at a nearby casino. There the former actress Sabine, now the Baron's dutiful assistant, transcribes the dialogue of an anally fixated porn film while the Baron doles out money for Vicky's film. On the beach, Vicky arranges an unnamed Actress and Actor on the sand in imitation of Camille's and J√©r√¥me's deaths. Later, he relentlessly shoots take after take of the Actress as she tries to articulate her lines ‚Äì statements once spoken by Camille ‚Äì amid a torrent of wind and rain. The elderly director eventually instructs the young Actress to shout simply, \\"yes.\\" The scene shifts to the film's debut at a small theater. The people lining up don't even make it inside. Realizing that it is an art film shot in black and white, depicting the horrors of war, and not the least bit prurient, they wander off in disgust to see something called \\"Terminator 4,\\" while the theater owner hurriedly removes the posters for the film. Sabine's ex-boyfriend arrives and declares to Baron Felix that \\"justice has been served.\\"  For Ever Mozart  In the fourth and final movement, a group of people files into an ornate hall to attend a Mozart piano concerto performed by a youth orchestra. The performance is unable to begin until the pianist, an effete young man in period garb, secures one of the set runners from \\"Fatal Bolero\\" as a page turner. As the performance commences, a fatigued Vicky keeps time to the music in the hallway, unable to make it past the top of the stairs. Inside, the music plays on, and the pages, showing Mozart's carefully crafted notation, keep turning.

In the article, Sollers criticizes the plan, considering Beckett too depressing for the Bosnian War, and instead suggests Marivaux's The Game of Love and Chance. Godard himself could not find the play at the bookstore in his home town of Rolle, so he substituted the Musset play, as Camille does in the film. Reception Writing in Variety, David Stratton called the film \\"appallingly superficial and insensitive\\" for its \\"trivializ[ation of] the slaughter in Bosnia\\"; while Jonathan Rosenbaum declared the film Godard's \\"least-inspired feature since the late 60s.\\" French critics were much more receptive. In the US, Amy Taubin, writing in the Village Voice, emphatically endorsed the film, saying, \\"In confronting the failure of art to change the course of history and the moral obligation of the artist to nevertheless bear witness to her/his time, For Ever Mozart treads on ground so familiar it can only be played as farce . . . In the age of unreason . . . beautiful image(s) . . . collide, fragment, and fly apart.\\" See also * List of submissions to the 70th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Swiss submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film References  External links  * Category:1996 films Category:French avant-garde and experimental films Category:French films Category:Swiss films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Jean-Luc Godard Category:1990s avant-garde and experimental films ","title":"For Ever Mozart"},{"id":"17756137","text":"__NOTOC__ Location of Akron in Summit County This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Akron, Ohio.

The story, written by Joss Whedon, is a crossover with Whedon's earlier Buffy spin-off, the graphic novel Fray (2001-2003), \\"Time of Your Life\\" features artwork by Fray co-creator Karl Moline. Plot Part I (Issue #16) Buffy fights future slayer Melaka Fray, in midair in the future New York City. Flashing back to the past, Xander, Willow, and Buffy discuss what Willow saw during her encounter with Kumiko. Willow believes that she received the message for a reason, and that they must act before they lose another slayer. Dawn, meanwhile, turns into a centaur. Somewhere in a lab, Twilight and Warren argue about a missile, which is covered in magical runes. They succeed to blasting the Scottish castle in which the 'Scoobies' live. In New York City, Buffy is transported to the future while confronting mystical time disruptions. She then meets Fray. Part II (Issue #17) Fray and her sister Erin find that their sibling Harth, now a vampire, has allied himself with a mysterious, dark haired woman. While supervising kidnap victims, said woman tells Harth that their actions 'now' will affect the past. Fray has a vague recollection of the woman, due to research. Meanwhile, back in the present, Willow has tamed the demon that switched places with Buffy during the time incident. In Scotland, snake-warriors invade the castle; it is severely damaged. Several unnamed Slayers have died in the attack but most have escaped. Fray and Buffy meet an ally, Gunther, a fish-like mutant in an attempt to gain more information about their enemies. Elsewhere, Harth tells his partner that he wants to kill Fray for being the only thing he ever loved; her pain is his joy. It is then revealed that Harth's ally (known to him as \\"The Madwoman\\") is none other than Dark Willow. Part III (Issue #18) In the Scottish woods after the main castle's explosion, Xander and Dawn continue their escape from the creatures that invaded the castle. During a brief respite, a horde of forest creatures threaten them and order them to leave their woods. The forest beings become nonplussed when Dawn tells them they aren't as scary as what has been chasing them. In the present, Willow continues to find a way to retrieve Buffy from the future while Kennedy questions if Willow can contact her source instead. In response, Willow asks if Kennedy truly trusts her and if she believes that whatever they do is for the greater good - when Kennedy agrees, Willow explains that she must speak to Saga Vasuki and in order to do this, she must orgasm. Kennedy and Willow then have sex to achieve this end and when Willow finds Saga she asks her how to get Buffy back to the present. Saga tells Willow that the time rift will reopen that night and she only wants Willow to reach inside and take Buffy out without looking inside. Willow obeys and bids farewell for now to Saga. Buffy searches through the Watchers' diaries and is completely befuddled and upset because there are a few ambiguous references to her and absolutely nothing recorded about the Slayer army she created. She and Fray decide to head to the \\"Uppers,\\" a normally secure area of Haddyn where vampires cannot usually get access to, and steal a flying car with access to the area. Meanwhile, Gunther is visited by Harth and other vampires. In response to Gunther revealing Harth's activities to Fray, Harth leaves a squad of vampires to attack Gunther instead is his tank. Buffy and Fray witness a group of vampires attacking defenseless humans. While Fray wants to slay the vampires, Buffy attempts to stop her, reminding her that according to Gunther, Harth sends out hunting parties of vampires, that they need to find where the parties are coming from, and that they cannot afford the time to rescue everyone who needs rescuing. Fray refuses to listen and slays the vampires, leaving Buffy alone to drive the flying car. After Fray finishes off all the vampires, Dark Willow approaches Fray, informing her that she has not been human for \\"quite some time now.\\" She tells Fray that her concerns are more personal than just getting rid of the lurks and shows that her magical powers have almost completely deteriorated, before requesting to show something to Fray. Buffy returns to Fray's apartment alone, where she is confronted by Fray's sister Erin, who believes Buffy is an intruder. After Buffy reveals that she is looking for Fray, Erin apologizes and the two discuss various matters relating to Fray, sisters, and how Buffy is a slayer from the past. In the middle of the conversation, Buffy is zapped with a ray gun and falls to the floor in pain. As Erin kneels over Buffy's unconscious body, remarking \\"Mel...are you sure about this?\\", as Fray responds: \\"I'm sure. We're saving the world.\\" Part IV (Issue #19) In the present, Dawn, Xander and the forest creatures prepare to battle against the demons that invaded the castle. As the fight starts, they are outnumbered until Xander's team of slayers appear with a group of Wiccans, who use magic to make the creatures corporeal, and easier to kill. Meanwhile, Twilight watches as Warren and Amy argue over the failed attack on the castle as Twilight turns to a new ally: Riley. Riley reveals that Buffy secretly met up with him in New York and requested that he act as her inside man against Twilight. In the future, Buffy has been kidnapped and tied up in Dark Willow's lair by Fray and Erin. While Buffy is unconscious, Dark Willow laments on how long she has lived. Fray asks what the plan is, telling Dark Willow that she won't kill a slayer, no matter what Dark Willow has shown her. Willow tells Fray to keep Buffy there long enough to miss the \\"extraction\\" at midnight; she seems to want Buffy not to go back to the present. Fray tells Erin what Dark Willow showed her: that if Buffy goes back, she will \\"change the world\\" - Willow has told her that Buffy going back to the present will result in changes that will mean Fray's future will not come to pass. Buffy regains consciousness and is stunned to see Dark Willow. Before they can speak further, Harth appears with a pack of vampires and reveals that Dark Willow told him that bringing Buffy to the future would cause his world to be, but told Fray the opposite. Willow responds that her intention for bringing Buffy to the future was in order to die; however, it is a matter regarding not who will die, but who kills them that matters. Furthermore, she admits that she is lying to either Fray or Harth but won't say who. As Harth threatens to kill everyone in the room, Gunther appears, still angry after his visit from Harth and his lurks, and causes a commotion that frees Buffy. Still wishing to save her world above all else, Buffy escapes and searches for the building where the extraction (caused by Willow in the present) is due to take place. When she arrives Fray is there, refusing to let Buffy leave in fear that Buffy's return to the past will erase Fray's present. The two slayers fight as Dark Willow watches. In the present, a blindfolded Willow prepares to bring Buffy back. In the future, Buffy runs for the portal that appears and manages to beat Fray. Confronted by Dark Willow, Buffy questions her true motives before reluctantly (but with emotional pain) stabbing her in the heart. Present-day Willow reaches through the portal and brings Buffy back to the present, where Buffy is relieved to see Willow is still alive and well. In the future, Fray is aghast, but is surprised and comforted by Erin, who comments that their present still exists. Production and writing This story arc was written by series creator Joss Whedon. The first issue was the eighth issue of the series to be written by Whedon. Penciller Karl Moline had previously worked with Whedon on the Buffy spin-off graphic novel Fray. Fray was featured as one of the main characters in this arc. This was the first time that Fray had crossed over into another part of the Buffyverse. Whedon felt that by having Buffy interact with Fray and Haddyn's future dialect, he could comment upon his own distinctive use of language in Buffy, stating \\"Buffy blames herself for what's happened to the English language, and there's a lot of hubris in that joke. I like to think that adding Y's to words that don't usually have Y's is going to destroy the whole fabric of our society.\\" Canonical Issues This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel continuity\\".Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007).

He was the first governor of Antioquia, part of the New Kingdom of Granada.Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango Born in Trujillo, C√°ceres, he was the son of Florencio de Rodas and Guiomar Coello. He arrived at Quito in 1540 and in 1541, he traveled to Popay√°n with Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar, entrusted with the task of relocating the settlement of Santa Fe de Antioquia. He was not successful in this, as he was arrested by the forces of the governor of Cartagena de Indias. However, he was liberated by the marshal Jorge Robledo and Rodas returned to Santa Fe de Antioquia. After the execution of Robledo in 1546, Rodas was named governor of Antioquia. This was confirmed again in 1576 by the Real Audiencia de Santa Fe de Bogot√° upon the death of Andr√©s de Valdivia. The first mission entrusted to Rodas was to punish the tribes who had assassinated Valdivia. Having completed this mission, Rodas founded C√°ceres in 1576 and returned to Antioquia. He also attempted to pacify the indigenous peoples at Marequita and at the valley of Aburr√° . In 1581, he founded Zaragoza de las Palmas.

During the 7th century, the lazy and messy King Dagobert I goes to Rome to ask Pope Honorius I for forgiveness of his sins of revelry and fornication. But Dagobert does not know that the pope, while he is still traveling, was replaced in a conspiracy by a perfect double. The replacement is a crude and rude man, even more stupid than Dagobert is.

Bernice Morrison was born in St. Louis, Missouri to William M. Morrison and Sara Catherine \\"Kate\\" Swinney (The famous Paddle Wheeler \\"Kate Swinney\\" was named after her). After both of her parents died at an early age, she was raised by her maternal grandparents, Captain William Daniel Swinney and Lucy Ann Jones who owned a tobacco plantation in Glasgow, Missouri. Her name lives on in central Missouri because in 1874 she pledged $100,000 to Carr Waller Pritchett to build a world class telescope in Glasgow at the Pritchett Institute. The telescope and the Morrison Observatory were moved to nearby Fayette, Missouri during the early part of the 1930s. It stands there today as one of Central Missouri's hidden treasures as a fully functional piece of science history operated by Central Methodist University. Also of some interest are her memoirs entitled Plantation Life in Missouri, which expose details of a mostly forgotten period of Missouri history.

LaBruzzo occupied the legislative district formerly held by Charles Cusimano, David Duke, and David Vitter. However, effective in January 2012, part of the district, including LaBruzzo's \\"Bucktown\\" residence, merged into neighboring District 94 in New Orleans. A New Orleans native, LaBruzzo graduated from the Roman Catholic boarding and day school, St. Stanislaus, located in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He is employed in the fields of medical equipment and real estate sales. LaBruzzo and his wife, the former Brandi M. Davison, originally from Baton Rouge, reside in Metairie with their young daughters, Ava and Emme LaBruzzo. He had immediately begun campaigning for the District 94 seat upon the close of the 2011 legislative session. District profile District 81 formerly included a section of Metairie, a large unincorporated area of Jefferson Parish, near the storied 17th Street Canal, which was breached in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The district consisted of the mostly residential neighborhoods of \\"Bucktown\\" (until redistricting moved this area to District 94), \\"Hog Alley,\\" and \\"Old Metairie.\\" Many of the residents were upper income, especially in the Old Metairie neighborhoods near the Metairie Country Club and enclaves on Metairie Road. There were pockets too of older, blue-collar residents and mostly middle-class whites. The district was arguably one of the most conservative in the state and had a large number of declared Republican voters. In the House, LaBruzzo served on the Civil Law and Procedure, Health and Welfare, and Labor and Industrial Relations committees. Legislative elections In the nonpartisan blanket primary for House District 81 held in October 2003, the Republican incumbent Jennifer Sneed Heebe did not seek a second term but was instead elected to the Jefferson Parish Council. John LaBruzzo led a large field of candidates in the primary with 4,111 votes (25.6 percent). He was placed in a runoff with fellow Republican Mickey Landry, who trailed with 3,717 votes (23.1 percent). Eric Skrmetta, later a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, finished third with 2,488 votes (15.5 percent). Three other Republicans and a Democrat held the balance of the votes cast. In the second round of balloting, called the general election in Louisiana even if both candidates are of the same partisan affiliation, LaBruzzo prevailed with 10,142 votes (57.5 percent) to Landry's 7,504 votes (42.5 percent). LaBruzzo was unopposed for his second term in 2007. In June 2005, Representative LaBruzzo, in only his second year in the House, entered the special election contest for the District 6 seat in the Louisiana State Senate vacated by the death of veteran Republican lawmaker John Hainkel. He finished fifth of seven candidates in the running, having received 1,772 votes (10 percent). Republicans Julie Quinn and Diane Winston entered the runoff election in July, and Quinn prevailed. In the Senate race, LaBruzzo had argued that he was more conservative than his intraparty rivals.New Orleans Times-Picayune, June 1, 2005 Voluntary sterilization proposal On September 23, 2008, LaBruzzo raised controversy by proposing that women who receive public welfare benefits should receive $1,000 if they voluntarily choose to be sterilized. The proposal was criticized by opponents as \\"racist, sexist, unethical, and immoral.\\" The plan was similar to a previous proposal by former Representative David Duke, whose 1991 legislation offered $100 a year to welfare recipients who used Norplant. That proposal too was defeated. LaBruzzo's proposal urged permanent sterilization, rather than the temporary birth control advocated by Duke. Norplant has a 5-year period of effectiveness. Then State Senator Joe McPherson, a Democrat from Woodworth in Rapides Parish, said of LaBruzzo: The public furor and negative reaction that arose over LaBruzzo's proposal led to his losing a leadership position. On October 6, 2008, he was removed by Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives Jim Tucker as the vice chairman of the House Health and Welfare Committee. Pro-life legislator LaBruzzo was among the most ardently pro-life of Louisiana state legislators. In 2011, he defended a bill that he introduced to establish a \\"prosecutable crime for doctors\\" who perform abortions except in medical emergencies: 2011 primary defeat Under the House redistricting plan, LaBruzzo was placed into the same district as neighboring first-term Republican Representative Nicholas Lorusso in District 94, and the two faced each other in the primary held on October 22, 2011. Lorusso prevailed with 5,087 votes (56.6 percent) to LaBruzzo's 3,909 (43.5 percent). Governor Bobby Jindal had remained neutral in the Lorusso-LaBruzzo showdown, but Senator Vitter had appeared with Lorusso even though Vitter's Committee for a Republican Majority made no endorsement in the contest. LaBruzzo had considered not running again for the House in 2011 but instead seeking to succeed Jennifer Heebe, his House predecessor, in the District 5 seat on the Jefferson Parish Council in a special election held on April 4, 2009. The District 81 seat is now held by Republican Clay Schexnayder of Ascension Parish, a businessman who polled 5,549 votes (64 percent) in the low-turnout general election held on November 19, 2011. Schexnayder defeated Democrat Kevin Hull, who received 3,116 votes (36 percent).Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 19, 2011 In 2015, Schnexnayder was one four Republicans on the House Civil Law and Procedure Committee who voted to table the Marriage and Conscience Act sponsored by conservative Representative Mike Johnson of Bossier Parish. 2015 comeback falls short Early in 2015, laBruzzo announced he is considering making his political comeback on the Jefferson Parish Council. In the primary election for the District 9 seat in the Louisiana Senate held on October 24, 2015, LaBruzzo fell short in his challenge to incumbent fellow Republican Conrad Appel. LaBruzzo polled 11,109 votes (43 percent) to Appel's 14,701 (57 percent).

They had a son, Ananda Coomaraswamy, the eminent art critic. Career After finishing school Coomaraswamy joined the Ceylon Civil Service as a cadet at the Colombo Kachcheri. He was appointed police magistrate and was known as the \\"boy magistrate\\". He resigned from the civil service after a short period. He joined the legal profession as an apprentice under Richard Morgan. He was called to the bar at the age of 22.

The former Police officer, who spent 20 years in the Criminal Investigation Department, was an outspoken politician, who championed what he saw as the interests of western Fiji. He has endorsed calls for a return to the former system of customary justice, in force during the colonial era, under which convicted offenders would be returned to their villages not only for punishment but also for counselling and correction, according to the Fiji Times (17 March 2006).  Political career  Lesavua won the Ba East Fijian communal constituency in the House of Representatives in the 1999 general election, as a candidate of the Party of National Unity (PANU), which he subsequently led in Parliament, having also acted as Sports Minister.\\"Fiji Sevens not in jeopardy\\", ESPN Scrum, February 9, 2000, retrieved 2010-02-08 Some major political realignments followed the failed coup d'√©tat of May 2000, and in the general election of 2001, he was defeated by the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) candidate, Epeli Seavula.

Lesavua changed his political affiliation twice during 2005. On 7 September 2005, Lesavua announced that he had joined the Labour Party and had applied for the party's nomination for either his old seat, or the Northwest Urban Fijian communal constituency, for the election scheduled for mid-2006. Following the merger of PANU with the Protector of Fiji Party to form the People's National Party, he had quit the latter party on principle, he said, in the wake of its decision to join the Grand Coalition Initiative Group, a coalition of ethnic Fijian parties. Citing public demand, Lesavua announced on 25 November 2005 that he had decided to relaunch PANU, and would be filing within one week the necessary documents to reregister the defunct party.

It was first formed as AES Group in 1987 by Arzamasova, Evzovich, and Svyatsky, becoming AES+F when Fridkes joined in 1995. The collective works in photography, video, installation, and animation, as well as more traditional media, such as painting, drawing, and sculpture. AES+F's early work included performance, installation, painting, and illustration. Well known for their monumental video-art installations that Gareth Harris describes as \\"monumental painting set in motion\\", AES+F create grand visual narratives that explore contemporary global values, vices and conflicts.  Members   Arzamasova, Tatiana  Tatiana was born in 1955 in Moscow, where she graduated from Moscow Architectural Institute (MArchI) ‚Äì State Academy in 1978. Prior to founding AES Group, Tatiana was a conceptual architect. She participated in conceptual architecture exhibitions in London, Paris, and Venice, .  Evzovich, Lev  Lev was born in 1958 in Moscow, where he graduated from Moscow Architectural Institute (MARCHI) ‚Äì State Academy in 1982. Prior to founding AES Group, Lev also worked in conceptual architecture. He participated in conceptual architecture exhibitions in Milan, Frankfurt-on-Main, and Paris. Lev also worked as an art director in film.  Svyatsky, Evgeny  Evgeny was born in 1957 in Moscow, where he graduated from Moscow University of Print Design in 1980. Prior to founding AES Group, Evgeny worked in book illustration, advertising, and graphic design. Evgeny also worked as the creative director for publishing houses in Moscow.  Fridkes, Vladimir  Vladimir was born in Moscow in 1956, where he worked as a fashion photographer prior to joining the collective. His work was published in many leading fashion magazines: VOGUE, Harper's Bazaar, ELLE, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, Sunday Times Style and others.  Career  AES+F began their career as AES Group, with Arzamasova, Evzovich, and Svyatsky forming the group in 1987. The collective exhibited internationally for the first time in 1989 with a solo show at Howard Yezerski Gallery in Boston, and a performance at the Carpenter Center at Harvard University in Cambridge. The group expanded with the addition of the photographer Vladimir Fridkes in 1995 and subsequently changed its name to AES+F. The collective achieved worldwide recognition and acclaim in the Russian Pavilion at the 52nd Biennale di Venezia in 2007 with Last Riot (2007), the first in a trilogy of large-scale, multi-channel video installations that have come to define the AES+F aesthetic. The second of the series, The Feast of Trimalchio (2009), appeared in Venice in 2009, and the third, Allegoria Sacra (2011), debuted at the 4th Moscow Biennale in 2011. Together, all three projects premiered as The Liminal Space Trilogy in September 2012 at the Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin, and the Moscow Manege, the central exhibition hall of the artists‚Äô home city. The Trilogy was shown in the Museum of Fine Arts in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland (June‚ÄìSeptember 2014). Most recently all three videos were shown at Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY (June‚ÄìSeptember 2015). AES+F have exhibited at numerous international festivals: (namely the biennales of Venice, Lyon, Sydney, Gwangju, Moscow, Gothenburg, Havana, Tirana, Istanbul, Bratislava, Seoul etc.), ARS-06 (KIASMA, Helsinki). Their works appear in some of the world's most important collections, such as Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Mus√©e de l'Elys√©e (Lausanne), MOCAK (Krak√≥w), Sammlung Goetz (Munich), ZKM (Karlsruhe), Maison europ√©enne de la photographie (Paris), Art Gallery of South Australia (Adelaide), and the Museum of Old and New Art (Tasmania), Centro de Arte Dos de Mayo (Madrid), Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris), and the Louis Vuitton Foundation (Paris). Their work is represented in some of Russia's principal national museums, such as Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), Russian Museum (St. Petersburg), and the Multimedia Art Museum (Moscow). AES+F's newest project, Inverso Mundus was presented at the 56th Venice Biennale as a collateral event at the Magazzini del Sale.http://aesf.co/projects/inverso_mundus Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin, exhibited Inverso Mundos (2015) and archived an essay dedicated to AES+F on their website  Works  Islamic Project - Central Park by AES+F, 1996.http://aesf- group.com/projects/islamic_project/  Islamic Project (1996-2003)  Islamic Project began in 1996 as a performance and public intervention. AES+F created the \\"AES Travel Agency to the Future,\\" an imitation of a travel office with subversive materials - souvenirs from a future in which the influence of Islam has been superimposed upon all of Western culture in the form of architectural and cultural transformations. In one of the images, the artists transformed the Statue of Liberty to show her in a Burka, holding a Quran; in another, they prophetically depict the New York skyline absent of the Twin Towers. According to AES+F, \\"it is a kind of social psychoanalysis - a visualization of fears of Western society about Islam\\". The project has been met with attempts to censor certain imagery when it was shown in the New Art Gallery in Walsall, United Kingdom in 2006. In 2000, AES+F created another installation in the form of a Bedouin tent titled \\"Oasis\\". This installation consists of a series of traditional carpets, each with imagery from the Islamic Project printed on silk in the center. The artists imagined Oasis as a place for meditation, complete with traditional hookah and Arabic music. Oasis was first exhibited at the La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona, Spain. Islamic Project has been shown in most European countries, as well as the United States and South Korea. KFNY by AES+F, 2003.http://aesf- group.com/projects/king_of_the_forest/  King of the Forest (2001-2003)  The King of the Forest is a trilogy of projects inspired by Erlk√∂nig, the Ogre - a mythological creature of medieval Europe and also the subject of an eponymous novel by Michele Tournier. The King of the Forest stole beautiful children from nearby villages and kept them in his palace. According to AES+F, this series of projects concerns itself with the theft of youth by mass media culture - a contemporary analogue to the medieval Ogre. In AES+F's King of the Forest, the artists created three videos on different continents - Le Roi des Aulnes in St. Petersburg, More than Paradise in Cairo, and KFNY in New York. The first in the series, Le Roi des Aulnes, was shot at Catherine the Great's palace in Tsarskoye Selo. The second, More than Paradise, was shot at the Mosque of Muhammad Ali. The final project in the series, KFNY, was shot on Military Island in Times Square. In each of the three projects in King of the Forest, the location reveals the culture that assumes the role of the mythical creature - abducting children.  The Liminal Space Trilogy  The Liminal Space Trilogy attempts to analyze the 21st century from the perspective of a centuries-old art-historical tradition of depicting Hell, Heaven, and Purgatory. The trilogy is presented as three projects consisting of video installations, prints, drawings, paintings, and sculptures. It is set respectively in a video game landscape, an exotic luxury resort, and a futuristic airport, each of which is depicted as a unique surrealistic fantasy that explores contemporary themes.Reisman, Sara. \\"To Hell and Back: AES+F‚Äôs Trilogy.\\" AES F the Liminal Space Trilogy : Au Seuil Du Paradis Et De L'enfer. By Lada Umst√§tter, Olga Sviblova, Gareth Harris, and Mus√©e Des Beaux-arts (Chaux-de-Fonds). Milano: SilvanaEditoriale, 2014. 115+. Print. = Last Riot (2005-2007) = The project consists of an HD video installation (3- and 1-channel versions), series of stills from the video, series of pictures, series of drawings, series of sculptures Last Riot premiered at the Russian pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2007, earning AES+F significant global recognition and acclaim. The work pushed the boundaries of the medium of video art, introducing original technique and a visual language unique to AES+F. Last Riot depicts an imagined future digitally manipulated where snow-capped mountains sit next to desolate beaches, neon dragons rest atop oil platforms, planes collide without flames, and a band of attractive teens with completely ambiguous and detached facial expressions are engaged in ritualistic battle with one another and with themselves. It is a virtual reality populated by children and adolescents, where there is no real empathy or pain - a simulation in cyber-space that combines the real and the virtual, creating a post-apocalyptic vision of a world where the mythologies of all cultures are intermingled with the myths of contemporary media-culture. Conceived as a reflection of the 21st century, Last Riot raises questions regarding Western values, and reflects contemporary Western mythology without passing judgment. The visual ethos of Last Riot is rife with allusions to art history, from Caravaggio and Baroque painting, to Romanticism, combined with contemporary visual culture in the form of advertising, film, and video games, and traversing the aesthetic line between beauty and ugliness. AES+F describe the world they created as a \\"paradise [that] is a mutated world where time is frozen and the past is neighbor to the future. Its inhabitants are devoid of gender, becoming more like angels,\\" where all of the heroes are rebels in a computer-generated world devoid of ideology, history and ethics. = The Feast of Trimalchio (2009-2010) = The project consists of an HD video installation (9-, 3-, and 1-channel versions), series of pictures, series of stills from the video, series of portfolios with photographs and drawings. The second project in the Liminal Space Trilogy, The Feast of Trimalchio, is titled as such in reference to the epic \\"Satyricon\\" by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, namely, the Cena Trimalchionis, which describes the life of a wealthy former slave who hosts gluttonous and orgiastic feasts. In AES+F's The Feast of Trimalchio, an imaginary island with an absurdly luxurious resort-hotel, which is a de-personification of Petronius' Trimalchio, serves as a \\"temporary paradise\\" that guests pay to enter. The island's landscape combines a tropical beach with a ski resort, with scattered structures simulating the architecture of ancient Rome. The masters, clad in full-white attire, span all ages and social strata, while the \\"servants\\" are attractive youths from colonized lands of different continents, dressed in traditional ethnic garb and working in Trimalchio's hotel as its permanent staff. The Feast of Trimalchio is a deconstruction of the self-obsessive and indulgent behavior of modern civilization and is an allegorical symbolization of a mass-media generated version of Heaven. The guests of the hotel indulge in all of the contemporary pleasures perpetuated in advertisements of resort getaways, from leisurely fitness to \\"body purification,\\" while the viewer sees any notion of social hierarchy dissipate as the masters begin to court the servants, acting out their fantasies of a Roman Saturnalia.Harris, Gareth \\"The Best Times AES+F\\" In AES+F: The Liminal Space Trilogy, edited by Joe Lin-Hill, Elena Krishtoff, Martin Richling, Andrej Trofimov, pp. 37-47. Moscow: Triumph Gallery, 2012. The pleasures in AES+F's Feast of Trimalchio are intermittently interrupted by catastrophes that are simultaneously tragic and comical. Allegoria Sacra, Knight and Death, by AES+F. 2012http://aesf- group.com/projects/allegoria_sacra/ = Allegoria Sacra (2011-2013) = The project consists of an HD video installation (5-, 3-, and 1-channel versions), series of pictures, series of stills from the video. Allegoria Sacra is the final part of the Liminal Space Trilogy. Named after Giovanni Bellini's eponymous painting which hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, AES+F's Allegoria Sacra represents Purgatory. Taking place in a futuristic international airport, Allegoria Sacra serves as a metaphor for limbo, where the souls of \\"righteous sinners\\" await their fate. The characters that inhabit Giovanni Bellini's masterpiece, from biblical figures to mythological creatures, were transposed and sometimes reinterpreted by AES+F. The Saracen-Muslim was transformed into a group of refugees. St. Sebastian became a young, shirtless traveler, hitchhiking his way through tropical countries, while Apostle Paul is represented as an airport policeman. However, AES+F's piece is more of an allegory of contemporary life than a reinterpretation of Giovanni Bellini's painting. As the travelers enter dream-like states, the airport and the aircraft undergo several metamorphoses, while the landscape and the climate go through four phases - from being a snowy field to a desert, a jungle, and finally becoming an endless river Styx. Maintaining their signature style, AES+F combine recognizable motifs from art-history and pop-culture, such as the numerous allusions to Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Allegoria Sacra weaves complex global issues into visually compelling metaphors, letting them unfold in the neutral transitory space of an airport, where all kinds of things can temporarily coexist before going to their destination. Allegoria Sacra won the Sergey Kuryokhin Award 2011, the main award of the Kandinsky Prize 2012, the main award of the Nordart Festival 2014, and the Pino Pascali Prize 2015 (18th Edition).

The Sleepers are depicted as a series of five destructive robots created by the Red Skull. Fictional character biography The Sleeper was the most powerful of five doomsday robots designed in Berlin by Nazi Germany as agents of destruction. After World War II, the Sleeper was entombed within a crypt that was sunk into the sea. The first three robots were activated by agents at a certain time in European villages, consisting of a giant human-like robot with blaster rays, a winged robot, and the 'brain', which resembled the Red Skull and was a powerful bomb. Despite Captain America and the personnel of a nearby US Army base's attempts to stop them, the robots combined and flew towards the North Pole. While in pursuit with the military, Captain America surmises that the first Sleeper would use its blasts to dig into the ice, enabling the robot to travel into the Earth and explode, destroying the world, as the Red Skull had vowed that if he could not conquer the world, he would destroy it. To prevent this, Captain America is able to board the combined vehicle in midair and detonate the bomb early with a flamethrower, destroying the three Sleepers.Tales of Suspense #74 The crypt containing the fourth Sleeper was retrieved from the sea in modern times, and when the Sleeper reactivated it destroyed a seacoast smelting factory and battled Captain America. The Sleeper was ultimately rendered intangible by a \\"sonic crystal\\".Strange Tales #115 Similarly, the Red Skull later activated the fifth Sleeper, only to have it stopped by Captain America and the Falcon as well.Captain America #148 The fourth Sleeper was later restored to tangibility by the Machinesmith and was used as a \\"Trojan horse\\" to gain entrance onto Avengers Island in order to liberate the various robots incarcerated there. It was thwarted by Captain America, and badly damaged.Captain America #354 The damage done to the fourth Sleeper was later repaired by the Machinesmith.Captain America #368 The Sleeper was animated by the Machinesmith to join the Skeleton Crew in search of the missing Red Skull. It battled Hellfire Club mercenaries, and the Black Queen.Captain America #369 Replicas of the five Sleeper robots were then pitted against Captain America and Diamondback.Captain America #370 Powers and abilities The fourth Sleeper's robotic materials, design, and construction provide it with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes. It possesses a limited artificial intelligence, with a capacity for limited self-motivated activity. The Sleeper is programmed to be moderately proficient at hand-to-hand combat. The Sleeper has repulsor-ray blasters mounted in its eyesockets. Originally the fourth Sleeper could alter its density from its natural tempered steel form to total intangibility. The circuits that controlled this function have burned out and have not been replaced. The vibration of a certain \\"sonic crystal\\" caused the Sleeper's intangibility control to malfunction. The Sleeper originally could also generate \\"volcanic\\" thermal energy and project it through its faceplate. This function has also apparently been eradicated. In other media Television * The original Sleeper story appeared in the Captain America subseries of The Marvel Super Heroes. It is seen in the installments \\"The Sleeper Shall Awake\\", \\"Where Walks the Sleeper\\" and \\"The Final Sleep\\". * A Sleeper robot appeared in the X-Men animated series. In the episode \\"Old Soldiers\\", it was defeated by Wolverine and Captain America. * Robots of a similar design to Sleepers appeared in the Spider-Man TV series. In the \\"Six Forgotten Warriors\\" saga, they were created to protect the Red Skull's \\"doomsday weapon\\". They were initially defeated by the Six Warriors, Kingpin and the Insidious Six, but were later reactivated by Electro to attack the United Nations. They were defeated once again by the Six Warriors. * The Sleeper appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. This version has a HYDRA stamp instead of a Nazi stamp. They appear in the episode \\"Winter Soldier\\". A Sleeper attacks the Hydro-Base in order to spring the Red Skull from the Hydro Base's prison. While Captain America and Nick Fury were looking for the Winter Soldier, they find him fighting a Sleeper. Captain America and Fury bring the mountain down on Sleeper as Captain America tricks it off a cliff. Winter Soldier later told Captain America and Nick that in the event that Red Skull's campaign as Dell Rusk fails, the Sleepers would activate. Five Sleepers in Washington, D.C. have been activated and end up attacking Washington, D.C. upon combining into one Mega-Sleeper with a Nova Cannon in its chest. The Avengers fought the Mega-Sleeper until Captain America and Winter Soldier arrive to target the CPU in its head. Captain America and Winter Soldier find Red Skull in the CPU part of the Mega-Sleeper where Red Skull plans to brainwash them to serve him. Winter Soldier then breaks free as the fight within the Mega-Sleeper damages it. The Avengers managed to cause the Mega-Sleeper to collapse into the clearing. * The Sleeper appears in Avengers: Secret Wars. This version is Skull-Net, the Red Skull's A.I. system. In the episode \\"The Sleeper Awakens\\", the New Avengers fight the AI while the Vision befriends a repaired robot nicknamed Skully. Both Skully and Skull-Net are voiced by Liam O'Brien. * Sleepers knowns as Sleeper-Mechs are introduced in season 5 of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as shock troopers for a lone HYDRA leader, United States Air Force General Hale. Introduced in \\"All the Comforts of being Home\\", they are remote-controlled by Hale's cybernetic associate, Anton Ivanov aka The Superior. Video games * Sleeper appears in the Captain America: Super Soldier video game. The Sleeper was discovered during the Middle Ages by Baron Zemo's ancestor Heller Zemo. Though they couldn't understand what the Sleeper is, Heller Zemo and his men realized it is something important. Castle Zemo was soon built around the Sleeper's resting place. Hundreds of years later, during World War II, the Castle was owned by Baron Heinrich Zemo, who thought that he was destined to awake the Sleeper and use it to help him in his world conquest. However, he unwisely made an alliance with Johann Schmidt, commander of the Nazi research division HYDRA. On Schmidt's orders, the soldiers of HYDRA occupied Castle Zemo, where Schmidt's top scientist Arnim Zola studied the Sleeper. In 1944, the castle was infiltrated by the American Super Soldier named Captain America. After he defeated the guards, he confronted Zola's robot while the Sleeper awoke and destroyed one Allied plane. However, the Sleeper was finally destroyed by Captain America.

He was married to Clare (n√©e Nightingale) until his death in 1981. They didn't have any children. He joined Arsenal in 1928 as a clerical worker, handling the club's box office and manager Herbert Chapman's personal correspondence. He soon gained Chapman's trust and assisted with transfer deals.

Feral goats occur in many parts of the world.  Species  Feral goats consist of many breeds of goats, all of which stem from the wild goat, C. aegagrus. Although breeds can look different, they all share similar characteristics. Physically, both domestic and feral goats can be identified by their prominent straight horns (more prominent on male goats), rectangular pupils, and coarse hair. In addition, most domesticated goats/feral goats lie around 100 - 120lbs, with heavier goats tending to be wild goats.  Behavior  The feral goat is seen in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Great Britain, Hawaii, Brazil, Honduras, Lebanon, Panama, Madagascar, Comoro Islands, Mauritius, R√©union, New Guinea, the Galapagos, Cuba and in many other parts of the world. When feral goats reach large populations in habitats which are not adapted to them, they may become an invasive species with serious negative effects, such as removing native scrub, trees and other vegetation. Feral goats are included in the 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species. However, in other circumstances they may become a natural component of the habitat, even replacing locally extinct wild goats. Feral goats are sometimes used for conservation grazing, to control the spread of undesirable scrub or weeds in open natural habitats such as chalk grassland and heathland.  Diet Goats are herbivores whose diet consists of plant materials such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. Due to their stomachs, which is four-chambered, goats have the capacity to eat many plants that are typically toxic to other animals. Capeweed, for example, is toxic to most animals due to the presence of high nitrate levels. However, goats have the capacity to process these chemicals and eat capeweed with little issue. Though goats stomachs are incredibly durable, some materials still remain deadly to goats and goats will seldom eat these materials. Molds, for example, are still highly toxic for goats and have the capacity to kill a goat if consumed. Nightshades and wilted fruit trees are also toxic to goats and any presence of Listeria bacteria can prove fatal to goats as they are incredibly susceptible to the bacteria. Outside of plant materials, goats have also been seen attempting to eat nearly any object that they're curious about as well. Notably, goats have been seen eating litter such as tin cans and cardboard and although their stomachs can process the material, they get no nutritional value from it and should still be eating plant materials.  Predators  Having a wide habitat range, goats also have a wide array of predators. Canine species are particularly impactful predators of the goat. These include coyotes, wolves, and foxes. In addition to these species, other animals such as bobcats and birds of prey, such as eagles, have been noted to hunt and eat feral goats. Feral goats throughout the world Majorca Majorca or Mallorca is an island in the Balearic Islands, which are a part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean Sea. These feral goats, also known as Balearen bocs, were introduced by humans between 2300-2050 BC. They were originally used as a food source but eventually they began being a threat to domesticated goats and native tree species. The biggest threat to their conservation is hybridization with current domestic goats, but both are the same subspecies (Capra aegagrus hircus). These populations threaten the growth of new trees in several forests on the island, specially oak forests. England Around 5000 BP non native goats also known as British primitive goats were brought to Britain as domestic stock, bread for milk and meat. Today, the goat species Capra hircus are still present in the country with a total population of 5,000-10,000 individuals. The number of goats are constantly changing due to management, conservation, reproduction and removal. This invasive goat species is destructive to the natural habitat and therefore means of removal are available. One way these goats are managed is through hunting. In England they do not have a closed season for goat hunting, and are able to be hunted year round. Ireland Feral goats were brought to Ireland over 4000 years ago for their meat, milk, and hair. They are typically found in mountainous regions of Ireland and have no known predators, not even humans. Feral goats are common in many areas of the Irish west coast including counties Mayo, Donegal and Kerry. There are about 5,000 goats in Ireland, and though they are not formally protected, they are often ignored by humans and not typically hunted. They are destructive when it comes to native species because they mainly eat grass, shrubs and young trees, but as of now there is no plan to eradicate them from the country. New Zealand Three goat species are known to exist within New Zealand, these being the Arapawa goat, the Auckland Island goat, and the New Zealand goat. Out of all of these, the Arapawa goat‚Äôs populations are too small for it to be any threat at all to the Arapaoa Island that it resides on, with them today being noted to be critically endangered. The Auckland Island goat was introduced as of the 19th century to serve as a food source for castaways on the island. Although about 100 goats were observed to have lived on the island at the time, this population managed to do considerable damage to the ecosystem of the island. As a result, the goat population was located and dealt with accordingly. About 60 goats were exported off of the island for domestication in 1992 and the remaining population was killed off. As of 1999, the Auckland Island goat has been considered extinct. The last species, the New Zealand feral goats, were brought onto the island in 1773 by early explorers, whalers, sealers and settlers who brought goats with them for food and bartering. Over time, more goats were brought in for a variety of purposes, from livestock to the handling of other invasive plant species. This problem culminated in 14% of New Zealand now being populated by feral goats, all of which have begun to destroy the natural plant life of the island. Currently, hunting and Judas goats are the primary means of handling the threat but this has not done much to stop the goats and they still remain a threat. Scotland The feral goats of Scotland were brought in by Neolithic-era humans for farming purposes but were likely abandoned around the late 1700s due to the Highland Clearances, the evictions of a significant number of tenants in the Scottish Highlands and Islands. These people were unable to bring their livestock with them and, instead, had to leave them to roam the Highlands. The goats from this collective of livestock were able to get a foothold in this environment however and within little time, the population of Highland goats exploded to about 3,000 to 4,000. Though they are very common to see, they are also heavily considered both a nonnative, invasive species by the Scottish government as well as a major threat to the Scottish Highlands with there being evidence of the goats contributing to grazing pressures on at least 18 different conservational sites. Hunting remains as one of the primary ways that the population is handled and though a few population management plans have been discussed, few have gotten off of the ground. United States The bulk of the United States‚Äô feral goat issue came from the San Clemente Islands, off of the coast of southern California. The goats were first immigrated onto the island as of 1875 from another nearby island, Santa Catalina Island, and had not been properly managed since, allowing their population to spike up to about 15,000. This population had begun to damage the natural ecosystem of the island, destroying crops and other plant life as well as interfering with the animals that had used said plants as a food source. The United States Navy, being the owners of the island as of 1934, allowed hunting and trapping of these goats until 1972 when it was determined that this had not made a dent in the goat population. A program had to be organized in order to properly exterminate the goats. The initial plan for handling the goat population involved going in with aerial forces and taking out the goats via helicopter. Fund for Animals, a group for ethical animal treatment, stopped this ruling though and suggested the alternative of auctioning off the goats to mainland U.S. citizens. This plan eliminated 3,000 goats from the island just by moving them to mainland farms to be domesticated once more and many of the goats that had not been bought were adopted by the Fund for Animals agency instead to protect them. Any remaining goats were permitted to be shot by the United States Navy and as of 1991, the island has been declared free of its feral goat issue. The Livestock Conservancy considers them a critically endangered heritage breed. In 2008, their global population was approximately 400; all now domesticated. The goats‚Äô bleat is so consistent that it is sometimes confused with a recorded goat sound. Wales Feral goats occur in the Welsh mountains. They are used for conservation grazing in a number of places, such as at Stackpole in South Wales or on Great Orme in Llandudno in North Wales.  Short and long term effects of invasion  Feral goats in any country cause many long term problems pertaining to the native vegetation. These problems are caused by overgrazing of these species, as well as the erosion of soil due to the loss of plant roots. These goats also affect native animal species because they are using a multitude of resources, causing an increased amount of competition. Lastly, they can affect the ecosystem by spreading plants and weeds into areas they aren't typically seen in through their excrement. This eventually causes damage because native species of plants now have competition. Besides environmental damage, they also cause damage to the economy by damaging agriculture and causing the government to spend in order to control them.

Friends) is a secular kibbutz in southern Israel, and one of the Gaza vicinity villages. Located at the confluence of Besor Stream and Gerar Stream in the north-western Negev desert, it falls under the jurisdiction of Eshkol Regional Council. In it had a population of . Re'im was founded in 1949 by members of the Israel Boy and Girl Scouts Federation who were demobilized from the Palmach. Geography Re'im is located between roads 232 and 234 in the western Negev, next to the Re'im Junction and Gama Junction. The ruins of ancient Gama (Tell Jemmeh) are located to the west of the kibbutz. West of Re'im is the kibbutz Kissufim, and north is Be'eri. Re'im's elevation is 50 m above sea level, and the Besor Stream passes through its territory. History The kibbutz was established in 1949 by former Palmach members with the provisional name HaTzofim Vav (lit. Scouts F). It was then named Tel Re'im (, lit. Hill of Friends) after the Arabic translation of the nearby archaeological site of Tell Jemmeh. It was eventually renamed Re'im in memory of members of the Gar'in who were killed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The name, meaning 'friends', was taken from the Book of Proverbs (18:24) to symbolize them. The kibbutz was planned by the architect Hanan Habaron, one of the founders of the kibbutz and a member until his death in 2002. The ascetic style was described as a visual expression of Habaron's social and architectural worldviews. Asaf Kashtan, an Israeli architect who wrote a book about Habaron, said that in recent years, Habaron's style fell out of favor with Re'im's residents. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has a base near the kibbutz. Prior to the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005, the base was used as a camp for the evacuating troops. After the disengagement, Re'im became the target of Qassam rockets fired at it from the Gaza Strip. In 2008, IDF troops at the nearby base near Nahal Oz requested that the base be relocated to the area near Re'im, away from the range of Hamas' mortar fire. Economy The kibbutz's economy is based on agriculture and its laser factory, Isralaser. IsraBig, which manufactures dice for stamping, also has a factory in Re'im. The kibbutz also has a room letting business, including a Bedouin accommodation tent. It suffered as a result of the Israel-Gaza conflict, and the kibbutz lowered its prices. In 2008, Re'im embarked on a project that would make it the first community in Israel, and perhaps in the entire world, to rely entirely on solar energy for domestic consumption. Sunday, a company which markets the technology in Israel, is to install solar panels on all 130 rooftops in the kibbutz. According to estimation, the system will be capable of manufacturing at least 2.5 megawatts per hour during peak consumption. The cost of the project is estimated at NIS60-100 million and the investment is expected to pay for itself in 10 years. The cost and revenues from electricity are to be divided evenly between the kibbutz and Sunday, and any excess energy is to be sold to the Israel Electric Company.

This is a clinical laboratory finding. It is visualized by drawing blood from a patient and viewing the blood smeared on a slide under a microscope. Normal neutrophils are uniform in size, with an apparent diameter of about 13 Œºm in a film. When stained, neutrophils have a segmented nucleus and pink/orange cytoplasm under light microscope. The majority of neutrophils have three nuclear segments (lobes) connected by tapering chromatin strands. A small percentage have four lobes, and occasionally five lobes may be seen. Up to 8% of circulating neutrophils are unsegmented (‚Äòband‚Äô forms). The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils is an important diagnostic feature of megaloblastic anaemias. Hypersegmentation can also be seen in many other condition but with relatively less diagnostic significance. Hypersegmentation can sometimes be difficult to assert since interobserver variation is high and segmentation may vary with race. A 1996 study performed in the United States found that blacks have a greater neutrophil segmentation than whites. Association with other diseases Megaloblastic anemia Neutrophil hypersegmentation is one of the earliest, most sensitive and specific signs of megaloblastic anemia (mainly caused by hypovitaminosis of vitamin B12 & folic acid). Nuclear hypersegmentation of DNA in neutrophils strongly suggests megaloblastosis when associated with macro-ovalocytosis.

It is significant as the birthplace of writer Henry David Thoreau. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. It currently serves as a museum and is open to the public. History The Wheeler-Minot Farmhouse is set on a property on the north side of Virginia Road in eastern Concord. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, large central chimney, clapboard siding, and a fieldstone foundation. The center entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a dentillated cornice. The farmhouse was originally built circa 1730 by John Wheeler.Epting, Chris. The Birthplace Book: A Guide to Birth Sites of Famous People, Places, & Things. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2009: 20‚Äì21. Later, the farm was purchased by Deacon Samuel Minot for his second son Jonas.Donahue, Brian. The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord. Yale University Press, 2004: 199. Jonas Minot was the stepfather of Thoreau's mother, having become the second husband of his maternal grandmother.Donahue, Brian. The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord. Yale University Press, 2004: 297. Though the building has been extensively modified over the years, this house was the farmhouse of a prominent area farm for 200 years. Unlike other writers and thinkers associated with Concord‚Äîincluding Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Amos Bronson Alcott, and Louisa May Alcott‚ÄîHenry David Thoreau was the only one born in the town.Felton, R. Todd. A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 7.

Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003: 357. He lived in town for most of his life. Shortly after Thoreau's death in 1862, scholars, disciples, and tourists began to seek out the author's birthplace.Epting, Chris.

Rutt spent almost 20 years of his life serving as an Anglican missionary in South Korea, a country for which he developed a deep affection. He was perhaps the last of the line of scholar- missionaries, beginning with James Scarth Gale, Homer B. Hulbert, George Heber Jones and the Anglican bishop Mark Napier Trollope who laid the foundations of what is now known as Korean studies. Some years after he retired as an Anglican bishop, Rutt was one of several Anglicans received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1994. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest the following year and spent the closing years of his life in Cornwall. Early life Rutt was the son of Cecil Rutt and Mary Hare (n√©e Turner).Debrett's People of Today (1 November 2000).

He was an honorary canon of Plymouth Cathedral. Korean studies and writings While in Korea, from 1954 to 1974, Rutt studied in great depth the language, culture and history of Korea, as well as Classical Chinese. He was an active member of the Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch, serving on the council, overseeing its publications and serving as its president in 1974. He published six scholarly papers in the RASKB's journal, Transactions, most of which reveal his deep knowledge of the Classical Chinese used in pre-modern Korea.cf. Richard Rutt, \\"The Chinese Learning and Pleasures of a Country Scholar\\", 36 (1960) His deep affection for the traditional culture of Korea, which had in fact almost ceased to exist by the time he arrived, was particularly expressed in his very popular volume, Korean Works and Days: Notes from the Diary of a Country Priest. One of his notable works of scholarship, apart from his translations, was his annotated edition (RASKB, 1972 / 1983) of the History of the Korean People by James Scarth Gale (first published in 1927) which includes a researched biography of the author. Like Gale, Rutt was fascinated by Classical Chinese and, after his retirement, he published a new translation of a challenging ancient Chinese classic, The Book of Changes, in 1996. He later assisted the historical research of the Anglican priest Roger TennantCharles Roger Tennant A History of Korea 1996 as well as co-authoring the encyclopaedia Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary with Keith Pratt. He was a member of both the Association of Korean Studies in Europe (AKSE) founded by William E. Skillend of SOAS and the British Association for Korean Studies (BAKS). In particular, Rutt was fascinated by traditional and formal sijo and older forms of Korean poetry in general.The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo, ed.

Knitting Rutt developed a passionate interest in knitting and authored a history of the craft in A History of Hand Knitting (Batsford, 1987). His collection of books about knitting is now housed at the Winchester School of Art (University of Southampton).

It runs in a general north‚Äìsouth direction from LA 70 in Grand Bayou to LA 1 northwest of White Castle. The route traverses the small town of White Castle, located on the west bank of the Mississippi River in Iberville Parish. It connects the town and surrounding farmland with the narrow ribbon of communities within the vast Atchafalaya Swamp situated along LA 70 and LA 75 on the Belle and Lower Grand rivers. LA 69 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering from portions of several former state routes. Route description From the south, LA 69 begins at a junction with LA 70 in an area of northern Assumption Parish known as Grand Bayou. The route heads north alongside the waterway of the same name through thickly wooded swampland. After , LA 69 crosses into Iberville Parish and intersects LA 996, which leads to the community of Bruly St. Martin. The highway continues through the swamp for another , at which point the surroundings begin to transition to dry farmland. later, LA 69 passes through the rural community of Samstown and intersects LA 404. Shortly afterward, LA 69 enters the town of White Castle as more residences begin to line the highway. Traveling along Bowie Street, LA 69 crosses the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks at grade and passes through the town's historic downtown area. LA 69 then has a junction with LA 1, a divided four-lane highway that connects with Donaldsonville to the southeast and Plaquemine to the northwest. LA 69 crosses LA 1 and turns west onto 4th Street, running concurrent with LA 405. The two routes exit White Castle three blocks later and travel alongside the west bank levee of the Mississippi River for to the small community of Bayou Goula. Here, LA 405 continues straight ahead along the River Road while LA 69 turns west onto Augusta Road, an old gravel plantation road. The route ends about later at a second junction with LA 1. Route classification and data The majority of the route, running from Grand Bayou to White Castle, is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as a rural major collector. The concurrency with LA 405 is classified as a rural minor collector, and the gravel section west of Bayou Goula is a rural local road. Average daily traffic volume in 2013 was reported as 2,400 vehicles from the southern terminus to LA 404, increasing to a peak of 6,000 through White Castle, while the remainder of the route carries less than 600 vehicles. The posted speed limit is generally , decreased to and through White Castle. LA 69 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The portion of LA 69 running concurrent with LA 405 along the west bank levee of the Mississippi River is a small part of a National Scenic Byway known as the Great River Road. History Pre-1955 route numbering In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 69 was part of four separate state routes, as follows: State Route 999 from the Assumption‚ÄìIberville parish line to Samstown; State Route 253 from Samstown through White Castle; State Route 30 along the Mississippi River to Bayou Goula; and State Route 261 west from Bayou Goula. The portion of LA 69 traversing the swampland south of Samstown did not exist during much of the pre-1955 era, although it had been planned as part of Route 999 since 1930 and was included in the original legislative description of that route. The highway was completed as far south as the parish line sometime after 1937, allowing a connection with Grand Bayou via what is now LA 996 (former State Route 566). The portions of the pre-1955 routes now followed by LA 69 remained largely the same otherwise prior to the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. The route was entirely gravel surfaced during this time except for a brief section of pavement through downtown White Castle. Post-1955 route history LA 69 was created in the 1955 renumbering, creating a continuous route between the Grand Bayou area and the town of White Castle. The highway continued to follow the existing route through Bruly St. Martin until the modern alignment was completed in the early 1960s. With the 1955 renumbering, the state highway department initially categorized all routes into three classes: \\"A\\" (primary), \\"B\\" (secondary), and \\"C\\" (farm-to-market). This system has since been updated and replaced by a more specific functional classification system. When finally completed, the new roadway in Assumption Parish was originally designated as part of LA 996 but was switched with the LA 69 designation around 1965. This change applied the route number within the \\"primary\\" system of state highways onto the best and most direct route, a practice not often followed during the pre-1955 system. As the 1955 route description indicates, LA 69 originally continued along Augusta Road across LA 1 west of Bayou Goula, but this portion of the route was returned to local control shortly afterward. About this same time, the section of LA 69 south of White Castle through Samstown was paved. The roadway traversing the swamp between Grand Bayou and Samstown was paved around 1965, but the portion along Augusta Road in Bayou Goula remains gravel to this day. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the portion of LA 69 running along Augusta Road in Bayou Goula was proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function. As of 2019, the portion of LA 69 running along Augusta Road in Bayou Goula is under agreement to be removed from the state highway system and transferred to local control.

Train games tend to be highly involved hobby games that take several hours to play. Like wargames, train games represent a relatively small niche in the games market. Not every game with a train in it is a \\"train game\\". For example, the domino game Mexican Train and Monopoly are not usually considered train games because they do not represent railway operations. Empire Builder and 1830 are examples of train games. Varieties Classic train games generally fall into two broad categories: 18XX games and \\"crayon rail\\" games: 18XX games originated in 1974 with the publication of Francis Tresham's 1829 and continued with such titles as 1830, 1856, and 1870. These games involve buying and selling stock in railway companies, laying track, and running locomotives to generate a profit. Most are hex map games in which cardboard tiles are laid to build sequences of railway track. Many 18XX games can be further divided into \\"1829 style games,\\" which emphasize company development, and \\"1830 style games,\\" which emphasize robber baron stock market manipulation.Boardgamegeek page on 18XX games Crayon rail games are more streamlined and do not contain a stock market component. They focus on laying track, delivering goods, and making profits. Instead of the hex map system found in 18XX games, railway tracks are drawn with crayons or dry erase markers. The first mass market crayon style game was Darwin Bromley and Bill Fawcett's Empire Builder which was released in 1980 by Mayfair Games,Boardgamegeek Empire Builder page however Railway Rivals by David Watts had been popular - especially amongst postal gamers - for nearly 10 years before that. Other games in the Empire Builder series include British Rails, Eurorails, India Rails, and North American Rails, to name a few. Some of these are even set in a fantasy or science fiction world, such as Iron Dragon and Lunar Rails. Another type of train game is Silverton, a Mayfair game that uses wooden blocks instead of crayons to represent increasing completion of rail networks (the pieces also block competitors in a mechanic similar to the station-tokens in 18xx games). Mayfair republished the original Two Wolf Games Silverton and includes the expansion map as part of the basic game. The deck- building board game Trains also includes rail laying and station building elements. The mechanics in Friedemann Friese's Power Grid were taken from crayon rail games. Its predecessor Funkenschlag even used crayons to denote power lines. In this sense, Power Grid is more of a \\"train game\\" than such train themed games as Ticket to Ride, Union Pacific, and TransAmerica. Tournaments Several competitions for train gamers are held at major game conventions by the Train Gamers Association. Their largest event is the Puffing Billy Tournament, but other competitions include Iron Man, the 18XX Championship, and the Empire Builder International.Train Gamers Association The Puffing Billy Tournament was named in honor of the world's oldest surviving steam locomotive, Puffing Billy, which was built in 1814. Another important event for train gamers is the Chattanooga Rail Gaming Challenge, which has been held in Chattanooga, Tennessee since 1997.

He was also briefly a member of fellow Betzefer bandmate Matan Cohen's death metal band Nail Within. Musical career Betzefer (1998‚Äì2016) Avital Tamir formed Betzefer along with guitarist Matan Cohen and drummer Roey Berman as a one-off band for a high school gig in 1998.Betzefer.com // Biography What started as a high school gig became a big part of the lives of the band members and since then the band started working, first as a cover band and later they started recording their own material, releasing Pitz Aachbar in 2000 and the EP New Hate in 2003. In 2005, the band released its first full- length album Down Low. Tamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza. Nail Within (2003, 2007) In 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. NAIL WITHIN  MusicMight In 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band. Again, the collaboration wasn't long and soon the whole old line-up reunited. It is being rumored that Avital Tamir, along with Betzefer bassist Rotem Inbar, will be involved in the new proposed album by Nail Within, though this wasn't confirmed, but it is known that Matan Cohen, Avital Tamir and Rotem Inbar, are all active in Nail Within.BETZEFER  MusicMight On Shoulders of Giants (2006-present) In 2006, Avital took time off from touring with Betzefer to start a new project dubbed On Shoulders of Giants together with 7% Mind Usage guitarist Idan Epshtein and Jerusalem based singer Katie Danielson.http://www.osogband.com/epk/ The three recorded their debut album titled Come Crashing, which was released independently on September 17, 2009. Avital handled most of the guitar duties on the record as well as the vocals, and the bass. Black Swan (2010-present) In early 2010, Tamir has started the alternative/garage rock band Black Swan with ex-Got No Shame lead guitarist Matan Ergas (AKA Nose). The band has played extensively in Israel through 2010 while Betzefer was on hiatus, playing both full band electric shows, as well as many stripped-down acoustic shows, even playing one whole show in two parts: opening with acoustic and main show as a full-band. The band has recorded several demos which were upped to the band's Facebook page, and is planning to record the album sometime in 2011, though Tamir will be busy promoting Betzefer's second album Freedom to the Slave Makers which was released in February 2011.

It operated from November 2007 to April 2010. History The Belfast Wheel was brought to Belfast in partnership with Belfast City Council and the Department for Social Development. It was operated by World Tourist Attractions. It opened in November 2007 and operated seven days a week. Views right across Belfast and Belfast Lough could be seen from the 42 fully enclosed climate controlled capsules which rose to a height of almost 60 metres, on an approximately 13 minute trip. A VIP capsule with DVD, glass floor and champagne on ice was also available. In May 2009, Belfast City Council voted to keep the big wheel on site for a further two years, from 1 September 2009. Subsequently, the Belfast Titanic Society objected to plans for the Belfast Wheel to remain at its current location because it obscured the Titanic Memorial. The structure of the wheel stood around and on top of the memorial, and the Society had proposed that the memorial be relocated to the north eastern corner of the City Hall grounds. On 30 November 2009, the location of the Belfast Wheel again caused a row, resulting in the Lord Mayor of Belfast Naomi Long discussing the potential move of the Titanic Memorial before the 2012 anniversary.BBC News website The Belfast Wheel closed for business on Sunday 11 April 2010. The operator, Great City Attractions, had announced a few weeks previously that it would be removed as the Environment Agency had objected to the wheel staying any longer, in order to ensure it did not become a permanent feature beside a listed building. Talks about moving the wheel to Belfast's Titanic Quarter came to nothing. The final ride was at 1800 BST. Protest On 22 June 2009 a 38-year-old man wearing only a pair of shorts climbed to the top of the wheel, which was brought to a standstill, trapping tourists for over three hours. The man, a member of the traveller community engaged in a caravan protest over accommodation, was eventually brought back to the ground by a specialist team of firefighters and charged with disorderly behaviour and false imprisonment.

An average of 6 is nearly impossible. Exams Quarter steps are usually used in exams to indicate grades between integer grades: e.g., 5.25. Sometimes, finer grained systems are used with steps of one-tenth. This is often the case in exams in which the grade is a linear function of the number of achieved points (Grade = achieved_point/max_points*5 + 1). Certificates Certificate grades are either rounded to integers or half-integers. After having rounded the individual grades, a weighted mean is used to calculate the overall result. The weight of a grade is normally proportional to the number of hours the according subject was taught per week. To pass a year, this overall result needs to be sufficient. Sometimes further conditions need to be fulfilled, such as a maximum allowed number of grades below four. At university level, classes can often be repeated individually in case of an insufficient grade, so not the whole year or semester needs to be repeated. In a typical exam, the average result will be somewhat above 4 with a variance between 0.5 and 1. This of course varies depending on the kind of exam, the tested class, the school level, the region, the teacher and other factors. Cantonal differences Since education is in the responsibility of the cantons (except for the federal universities), grading notations may differ depending on the region. In some regions, + and ‚àí are used to indicate marks below or above an integer. Sometimes the ‚àí is used to indicate a better grade if it stands after the grade and a lower grade if it stands before the grade (in which case ‚àí is a symbol for \\"bis\\", e.g. 'to', rather than 'minus'), for example ‚àí5 (4.75) is lower than 5 which is lower than 5‚àí (5.25) in that system. In some regions, decimal grades are used: 5.5, 4.5, etc. Universities At university level, in some cases, Latin expressions are used. The Latin grades for a passed final exam in law at the University of Zurich, for example, are \\"summa cum laude\\" (excellent), \\"magna cum laude\\" (very good), \\"cum laude\\" (good) and \\"rite\\" (sufficient).

The site, which has an industrial history dating to the 17th century, was adapted for the production of textiles in the 19th century, with the surviving complex dating to 1862. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History Industrial works in the Assabet River area of western Concord date to about 1660, when there was a bog iron works established. The river was soon dammed, with grist and sawmills serving the surrounding agricultural community. The first textile mill was built in 1808 by John Brown, the son of a local clothier, and produced cotton goods. The mill changed hands several times before coming under the ownership of Calvin Carver Damon in 1834. Under his ownership, improvements were made to the dam and tail race, and a more efficient water wheel was installed. In 1854, Calvin's son, Edward Carver Damon, assumed control of the mill. Damon Mill produced a unique textile known as domett cloth, a light wool-cotton flannel invented by Calvin Damon, which became a mainstay fabric used in underwear. By the 1870s it was producing a diversified array of materials, and employed 175 workers. On June 19, 1862, the wooden mill burnt to the ground. Edward Damon and architect Elbridge Boyden rebuilt the mill in the same year. The mill continued to produce textiles until the 1890s. It was mortgaged in 1893 and sold by 1898. In the early decades of the 20th century it was used by other textile firms for the production of worsteds, but its small size led to its eventual closure. From about 1930 to 1973 the plant was used for the cold storage of apples. Today, the mill has been rehabilitated, and is used as office space by various businesses.

It now serves as the Performing Arts Center at 51 Walden, which is operated by the Friends of Performing Arts in Concord (FOPAC). Resident groups include The Concord Players, The Concord Band, and The Concord Orchestra. The armory was built in 1887 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, as a rare well-preserved example of a wood-frame municipal armory. The armory was built in several stages, between 1887 and 1927. The front portion, or headhouse, was built in 1887, and the drill shed added in 1888. In 1896 the drill shed was lengthened. When the building was converted for use by veterans organizations and the Concord Players in the 1920s, the area housing the stage was added, to a design drawn up by the noted theater architect Clarence Blackall. In 1927 the stage area was extended to the rear to provide additional space for scenery. The building interior was extensively altered in the 1970s when FOPAC took over the property. The lower level of the head house now serves as a lobby area, which also extends into the former drill shed; its upper level serves as a dance studio. The drill shed has been converted into a theatrical auditorium, with its original ceiling trusses exposed, and acoustic treatments on the walls. The basement houses storage space and dressing rooms. Historical uses of the building during the 20th century include the screening of films by the Red Cross in the 1920s, and for annual town meetings between 1933 and 1946. It was also used to house town offices, and to provide space for a youth center. Due to its deteriorating condition, the building was several times considered for demolition in the 1950s and 1960s, but public outcry was successful in preventing that fate. FOPAC was formed in 1972 to convert the building into a dedicated performing arts space.

It acquired these responsibilities from Gray Coach, which originally operated the GO Transit bus service, and CN Rail, which originally operated the GO Transit train service. It was created on August 7, 1999, when the provincial government of Premier of Ontario Mike Harris downloaded provincial services. It was an arm of the Greater Toronto Services Board (GTSB). The downloaded service was disliked by Greater Toronto Area cities because of its lack of funds to expand or run the service. Opposition quickly mounted, but its elimination had to wait for Harris to leave office. The agency ceased to exist on January 1, 2002, when GO Transit was returned to the province under the GO Transit Act, 2001.

Operated as a non-profit, it now shows movies, hosts live performances, and is rented for private events. History  The Empress (1911‚Äì1912)  ;1911 Theatre was built by Independent Order of Odd Fellows and crowned the Empress Theatre. The building, designed by local architect, William A. Jones, was two-tiered with gold-leafed clouds on the ceiling, red velvet seats, and a pipe organ. The managers were ex-pats from San Francisco, Abe Marks and Gus Cohen. The Vallejo Evening Chronicle anticipated the theatre to be \\"...one of the prettiest small theatres on the coast\\" (January 23, 1912). ;1912 The curtain of The Empress Theatre rose for the first time on February 14 with a Sullivan and Considine vaudeville act (at the time, widely regarded as the most influential promoters of vaudeville acts in the country) where there were two performances each night with matinees on Saturday and Sunday. There were 940 seats and admission prices were 10¬¢, 20¬¢, and 30¬¢. Ushers wore red military uniforms trimmed with gold braid.  The Republic (1913‚Äì1915)  ;1913-1915 As with any change in management, when the Bert Levey Circuit was brought in to produce greater profits, the company changed the theatre's name from the Empress to the Republic to avoid confusion with another of their California theatres with the same name.  The Vallejo Theatre (1916‚Äì1928)  ;1916 The Theatre lease was transferred to Thomas O'Day who spent $5000 on improvements. The establishment reopened as the New Vallejo Theatre in which patrons enjoyed new cushion seats. ;1920 The United States Constitution outlawed the manufacture, sale, and transport of alcohol. The prohibition era began and endured for 13 years. During this time, musical comedies and eventually talking movies became the popular mode of entertainment.  The Fox Senator (1929‚Äì1951)  ;1929 Fox West Coast Theaters chain took over the operation and fully renovated the building's interior. The company installed 'talking picture' equipment for the price of $20,000, bringing the theatre into the modern era. Vaudeville as a form of entertainment was eclipsed. On October 24, 1929, known as Black Tuesday, the U.S. stock market crashed and The Great Depression began. ;1930 On the evening of March 28, 1930, a disastrous fire gutted the theatre causing nearly irreparable damage valued at $50,000 ‚Äî little more was left than the rafters and exterior walls. The owner, Fox West Coast, expected to close the theatre for good, but an inspection of the charred wreckage showed promise for a successful rebuild. Fox West Coast took on the challenge. ;1931 Major portions of the interior were renovated changing pedestrian traffic flow and seating arrangements to be consistent with other Fox theatres. In addition to a neon marquee, a Men's Toilet/Smoking Room and a Women's Toilet/Cosmetic Room were added. The theatre's structure and framing, stage and back stage areas as well as portions of the pre-fire decorative elements were retained. The building reopened as the Fox Senator Theatre, no longer showing any stage productions in favor of motion picture films. ;1951 After the war, Fox Theatre management identified a faster and less expensive method for updating its theatres to create \\"deluxe motion picture houses.\\" The company developed an in-house design department and renovated approximately 200 of their theatres to reflect the new corporate standards. The buildings were updated to feature brightly lit marquees, aluminum panels, display cases, juke box-like ticket booths and gypsum ornamentation referred to as the \\"Skouras-Style.\\" Decorative elements included undulating waves, lush swags, drapery and cloud-like gilded forms to draw the eye toward the screen. The Fox Senator's lobby, foyer and interior auditorium space were renovated.  The Crest (1952‚Äì1979)  ;1952 Ray Syufy purchased the theatre and renamed it the \\"Crest.\\" It was run as a single-screen movie house and closed ten years later. ;1978 Between 1962 and 1978 the building experienced a period of decline and neglect. The theatre was then purchased by the Elliot family, known for their deep Vallejo roots.  The Empress (1980‚Äì2003)  ;1980 The Elliott family lovingly restored the theatre to its 1950s appearance. Its golden clouds returned along with its original name, the Empress. The building's exterior was repainted and the \\"Empress Theatre\\" sign was painted into the pediment. Its window panels were uncovered and refurbished, seats from Fox Theatres were salvaged and installed, gypsum decoration was re-gilded, and period-appropriate carpeting was laid. The Empress thrived throughout the decade. ;1989 On Tuesday October 17, the Loma Prieta earthquake, measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, shook the San Francisco Bay Area; the Empress Theatre was not spared. To repair damage from the quake and make the building seismically safe for use was a task so monumental that it caused the theatre to sit vacant and derelict for nearly 20 years ;1990 Empress Theatre was designated Vallejo Landmark #17. ;2000-2003 The building changed hands several times between 2000 and 2003. The intervening ownership groups were Rick Sylvain and Brad Peck and subsequently Robert Litwin and Mel Gomez. Triad Communities then purchased the theatre for redevelopment in partnership with the City of Vallejo and the Vallejo Community Arts Foundation, Inc.  Preservation & Restoration (2004‚Äì2008)  ;2004 The Empress was purchased by Empress Theatre Associates LLC (ETA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Triad Communities LP (Triad), in a unique Public/Private partnership among the ETA/Triad, City of Vallejo and the Vallejo Community Arts Foundation (VCAF). The official groundbreaking took place in April. ;2006 Under Triad's guidance, the theatre underwent a restoration consisting of a comprehensive seismic retrofit while preserving the Empress' historic character and charm. The work also included upgrades to the theater's stage design as well as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. In addition, the Empress' lobby area and restrooms received extensive facelifts and the auditorium's 471 seats were replaced and more. ;2007 On May 8, the new marquee was tested for the first time. On June 11, Empress Theatre Associates LLC (and Triad) received City Council approval for federal tax credits to assist with recovering some of the costs associated with the theatre renovation. National Development Council, a national non- profit organization, helped Triad obtain New Markets Tax Credits to help cover costs of the renovation. ;2008 The Empress opened with a regular performance schedule in the Spring of 2008. ;2014 At the completion of the federally required tax credit holding period, the ownership of the Empress will be donated to the City of Vallejo as originally envisioned.

History Historically a textile and fashion industry was centered at Bor√•s and the area of Sjuh√§radsbygden in southern V√§sterg√∂tland of V√§stra G√∂taland County. Sweden's textile industry began to build up in the early 19th century. Decline of the Swedish textile industry from the 1950s resulted in reduced employment leading into the mid-1970s. The Textile Museum in Bor√•s started in 1972 in the premises of a former textile factory, √Ökerlunds Bomullsspinneri AB. That plant had dated to 1898 and was designed by English architect Philip Sidney Stott (1858‚Äì1937). In 2012, the museum was closed after it was decided to gather Bor√•'s textile operations in the same building. In May 2014, the museum was reopened in new premises in the Simonsland neighborhood in the former premises of Svenskt Konstsilke AB. The Textile Museum is a city-owned museum with two missions. It is first an industrial and mechanical museum, showing the growth of the Swedish textile industry through spinning and yarn production, the weaving of fabrics, and the knitting of tricot. Secondly, it is a museum of creation, showing and collecting Swedish textile design from the 20th century onward.

Life Chorley was born in Taunton, Somerset about 1810, the son of Lt Paymaster John Chorley of the 1st Somerset Militia (died February 1839). Most of his life was spent at Truro, where he acted for 30 years as sub-editor and reporter of the Royal Cornwall Gazette, an old-established Tory paper. He held also the posts of secretary to the Truro Public Rooms Company, and sub-manager of the Truro Savings Bank. For eleven years (1863‚Äì1874) he edited the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and was involved in managing the society. He died at Lemon Street, Truro, on 22 June 1874, aged 64. Writings Chorley was a man of wide scholarship, versed in the classics and several modern languages, and of good classical taste. It was his custom to print for the private gratification of his friends, to whom alone the initials \\"C. C.\\" revealed the authorship, small volumes of translations from dead and living languages. The most important were versions of George Buchanan's tragedies of Jephtha, or the Vow, and The Baptist, or Calumny, and two volumes of miscellaneous renderings from the German, Italian, Spanish, and French, as well as from the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. The titles of all these works appear in the pages of the Bibliotheca Cornubiensis. When the council of the Royal Institution of Cornwall proposed to bring out a volume under that title, the preparatory lists of the publications known to them were drawn up by Chorley and Thomas Quiller Couch. The scheme did not propose to go beyond works relating to the topography or the history of the county, and even within that limited area, the design was beyond the power of persons not acquainted with the treasures of the British Museum.

The largest coastal redwood tree in the grove by volume is the single-stem Del Norte Titan. The Lost Monarch is comparably large, but a large sprout from the ground at its base is not part of the main trunk structure. History The unofficially named Grove of Titans was discovered May 11, 1998, by botanist Stephen Sillett, and naturalist Michael Taylor in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park.Preston, Richard (2007). The Wild Trees: A Story Of Passion And Daring. Allen Lane Publishers. The discovery implies that Sillett and Taylor are the first to realize and declare the significance of the grove, not that they were the first ones ever to see it. Approximately 2011, a person from Oregon learned of and posted the grove's geolocation online. A surge of visitors followed, trampling hundreds of native plants. The surge of boot traffic triggered problems like damage to native plants, soil compaction, difficulty for scientists, and strain on limited park resources. Between 2012 and 2016, approximately 8000 sq.ft. of ferns, sorrel and other plants were destroyed by visitors. The native plant damage was most evident around a redwood called Screaming Titans. In July 2016 the parks posted a sign which states up to 3300 sq. meters impacted. It also used before and after photos to show the change over a period of several years. In May 2016, a $1,000 donation was sent by M. D. Vaden, Certified Arborist, to Redwood National and State Parks, earmarked for helping the Grove of Titans. In 2017, the parks revealed the need for donations far beyond the first $1000, and described a $1,000,000 boardwalk and trail plan. The parks went public through an interview and news writer. The article revealed that a non-profit Redwood Parks Conservancy received $300 for the grove as of February 2017. Another update from Facebook said $5,000 had been given, far short of one million. The park is hoping to raise $500,000 to get a grant to build an elevated walkway at the park that will help mitigate the damage from foot traffic. The deadline to get this grant is Dec. 31, 2018. Starting on Nov. 6, 2019, construction began on a 1,300-foot-long elevated walkway through the Grove of Titans. Flora Names of the named largest redwoods in this grove include Lost Monarch, El Viejo del Norte, Screaming Titans, E√§rendil and Elwing, Beregond, Aragorn, Sacajawea, Aldebaran, Stalagmight and Del Norte Titan. Several abundant understory plants are California sword fern ‚Äì Polystichum munitum and Redwood sorrel ‚Äì Oxalis oregana. Location The Grove of Titans is in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park of Northern California, south of Highway 199. The closest town is Crescent City, California. The location was described by author Richard Preston in his book The Wild Trees as \\"the bottom of a hidden notch-like valley near a glade.\\" The exact location within the park has not been revealed in this book for fear that excessive traffic will damage the grove.

A two-seat development of Handley Page's earlier single-seat Hanley, the Hendon was a single-engine biplane. While six aircraft were purchased by the British Air Ministry for evaluation and trials purposes, no further production ensued and the Hendon did not enter squadron service. Development and design While the single-seat Handley Page Hanley had lost to the similar Blackburn Dart in fulfilling the requirements for a carrier-based torpedo bomber to equip Britain's Fleet Air Arm, it was recognised by both Handley Page and the Air Ministry that a two-seat aircraft would be more useful both for operational purposes and for experimental work. An order was therefore placed on 27 November 1923 for six two-seat derivatives of the Hanley III, designated the Type Ta (later known as the H.P.25) or Handley Page Hendon to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 25/23 for an interim torpedo bomber.Barnes 1976, p.223, 225. The first of the six aircraft to fly, (serial N9724) flew on 7 July 1924, with the remaining five flying by September. It had a longer fuselage to accommodate the observer, who was provided with a .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun on a Scarff ring mounting, but initially, was similar to the Hanley III. Tests showed that it was tailheavy when carrying a torpedo, the outer wings being swept back by six degrees to avoid this.Barnes 1976, p.225. Operational history The six Hendons were used for extensive trials to investigate various configurations of leading edge slots/slats. These allowed one aircraft to successfully land on while carrying a torpedo and without using arrestor gear.Mason 1994, p.158.

It is about an actress called Rosie Seymour who accepts a date with a mysterious Sam Berryman, who seems to have mistaken her for a Joanna Rupelford. Background See also: Background on Damsels in Distress (plays) page. FlatSpin, along with GamePlan, was originally intended to be part of a pair of plays, both set in the London Docklands, and both using the same cast of seven. Ayckbourn has a flat in the Docklands, where he observed the neighbours do not know each other well and strange things can happen under their noses.Allen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn Plays London: Faber and Faber The pair of plays was eventually joined by a third, RolePlay, written as an afterthought, and the trilogy, Damsels in Distress, was shown in the Stephen Joseph Theatre's 2001 season.Damsels in Distress history on official Ayckbourn site Like the other two plays, this drew some inspiration from the London Docklands. Originally intended as a diptych, FlatSpin served as the contrast to the much darker GamePlan. As such, it had some of the lightness associated with Ayckbourn's early comedies. Characters As part of the Damsels in Distress trilogy, FlatSpin was written to use the same seven actors as the other two plays in the series. In this play, the characters are: * Rosie Seymour, mid-twenties, out-of-work actress, currently a flat-minder * Sam Berryman, thirties, something secret * Annette Sefton-Wilcox, late thirties, property company representative * Edna Stricken, forties, drug courier * Maurice Whickett, fifties, Sam's boss * Tracy Taylor, twenties, Maurice's favourite \\"helper\\" * Tommy Angel, thirties, thickset ex-SAS bodyguard Rosie and Sam are the central characters; the other characters make appearances in one or two scenes. Setting The entire play is set in flat belonging to a Joanna Rupelford, on the riverside in the London Docklands. As part of Damsels in Distress, the play was written to use the identical set to the other two plays. As with most Ayckbourn plays, it was originally performed in the Round for its original performances at the Stephen Joseph Theatre. However, it was adapted for the Proscenium for subsequent performances elsewhere. The play is performed in two Acts, each divided into two scenes. Synopsis At the beginning of the play, Annette Sefton-Wilcox introduces Rosie Seymour to one of several flats she is minding for a few days. This flat belongs to a Joanna Rupelford, who never seems to be at home (to the point where the labels are still on the pans). In the conversation, it is disclosed that Rosie is an actress with little success behind her (her only role so far being a rabbit in a miserable touring children's production), and no boyfriend, and that she is openly desperate for both. Her one hope is that she is down to the last two for a big role as Jane Eyre, but just after Annette leaves, Rosie receives a call from her agent tell her the part went to the other girl. Before Rosie can despair too long, Sam Berryman calls, introducing himself as a neighbour. After a few misunderstandings (including mistaking Rosie for a lesbian when Rosie says \\"it was between me and another girl\\"), Sam leaves, and comes back in again to start afresh. After further confusions, he goes out and comes back in again, and this time introduces himself, tells Rosie that she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and asks to take her out for dinner. Rosie, having already warmed to his magic tricks and stories of visiting sick children in hospital, accepts immediately. The only problem is that Sam assumes that Rosie is Joanna Rupelford. In the second scene, Rosie waits for Sam to come and cook dinner in her flat. Rosie tries on Joanna Rupelford's dresses. And the spanner in the works is that a woman keeps trying to contact Joanna, first by phone, and then in person. Rosie hurries her away, and the date itself works extremely well ‚Äì so well, in fact, that Sam's hands-on demonstration with Rosie of how to roll gnocchi ends up with them kissing on the work surface. Realising the cookery will never be completed, Rosie goes to the bedroom. But before Sam joins her, he makes a telephone call. Whoever he calls clearly insists Sam leave the flat, and leave now. Rosie is left on her own, thinking she has been left in the lurch yet again (albeit before sex and not after, which usually seems to be the case for her). Act Two follows immediately from the end of Act One. Rosie is suddenly confronted by two black-clad figures, Maurice Whickett and Tracy Taylor, the latter of whom is furious with her. When Sam returns, it is clear he knows these two strangers. It soon transpires that the three of them were all part of a sting: Joanna Rupelford does not actually exist, the flat has been set up for six months, there are cameras all over the flat (including the bedroom, which is some consolation to Rosie for earlier), and the operation to entrap a drugs courier is due to take place that night. Maurice is angry with Sam, who evidently does this sort of thing all the time, for disrupting the plan. The problem now is that Tracy was going to impersonate Joanna, but Edna Stricken ‚Äì the woman who Rosie hurried away earlier ‚Äì now believes that Rosie is Joanna, spoiling Tracy's big chance (an analogy to Rosie losing her big chance as Jane Eyre). The only chance of success now is if Rosie continues impersonating Joanna. Sam persuades Rosie, against her better judgement, to do so. In the final scene, Rosie is waiting in the flat ready. She has been reassured that she will be watched on camera, and help will come if there's any trouble. She is in the company of Tommy Angel, an ex-SAS bodyguard who makes wildly optimistic passes at Rosie, such as suggesting that many people find this sort of danger arousing. Tommy then asks Rosie to hit him on the head to show how tough he is. Rosie does so, and Tommy instantly falls unconscious, out of view. Seconds later, Edna calls at the door. Rosie plays the part of Joanna well, and hands over the case of money from a hidden compartment in a table as soon as she sees the drugs. Unfortunately, when Edna inspects the briefcase, it is full of cut newspaper instead of money. Even though Rosie knows nothing about it, Edna tries to punish Rosie by spraying acid in her eyes. After a struggle, Edna catches her and is about to do the deed when Tracy comes in and brutally incapacitates her. With the reason for the late arrival of help explained (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome ‚Äì he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not relish the prospect of explaining the missing money. He, Tracy and Tommy leave, and then Sam retrieves the real briefcase full of money from the extra secret compartment in the table that Maurice didn't know about. He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they disappear into the shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss. They depart, with Maurice quietly wishing Rosie the luck she'll need.

However, the success of RolePlay over the other two productions led to FlatSpin being sidelined, along with GamePlan, until eventually it was shown only once a week, to the disappointment of both Ayckbourn and the cast. There are two further professional productions recorded at the Arts Archive since the original Stephen Joseph Theatre run, slightly behind GamePlan and RolePlay.Arts Archive UK performance listings (continued) Critical reviews Shortly before FlatSpin was premiered, it was announced that a third Damsels in Distress play would be performed later in the season. As a result, there were few stand-alone reviews of FlatSpin, with many reviewers choosing to wait for RolePlay to review the plays together. This did not stop Jeremy Kingston of The Times giving a broadly positive review of the play, in spite of some reservations about some logical flaws, in particular singling out commendation for Alison Pargeter for her performance as Rosie.The Times review, 9 July 2001, as shown on Ayckbourn site Charles Hutchinson of the Yorkshire Evening Press also gave praise for her performance, noting that until now her career had consisted mostly of child and teenage roles (GamePlan included), and writing \\"... it is like that moment when the librarian takes off her glasses\\".Yorkshire Evening Press review, 4 July 2001, as shown on Ayckbourn site When the production was reviewed as part of the whole trilogy, both in Scarborough and on the tour, it generally enjoyed a good reception as part of the package. By now, the play had been compared at least twice to the film North by Northwest.The Guardian review, 11 September 2001 However, the play was again criticised for the holes in its logic, leading some reviewers to consider the play the weakest of the three.The Daily Telegraph review, 9 September 2002 Alison Pargeter's role as Rosie Seymour contributed to her winning the Best Newcomer in the Critics' Circle Awards.List of 2002 Critics' Circle awards on British Theatre Guide References External links *FlatSpin on official Ayckbourn website Category:2001 plays Category:Plays by Alan Ayckbourn ","title":"FlatSpin"},{"id":"17757914","text":"Young Soldierz is the debut and only studio album by American West Coast hip hop group Young Soldierz.

The group decided on the unusual spelling in order to differentiate itself from the official Europeanizing intelligentsia; they believed that the spelling \\"meshico\\" was historically more accurate as it reflected the original Nahuatl pronunciation of the word, and, for this reason, would be an appropriate name for a group dedicated to a professedly authentic understanding of Mexican identity (Mexicanidad). Among the many notable members of the group were Rosario Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez Eskildsen, Manuel S√°nchez M√°rmol, Francisco Javier Santamar√≠a, and Jos√© Vasconcelos. The Tabascan Dr. Ricardo Alfonso Sarabia y Zorrilla was one of the group's more assiduous promoters and served for a time as director of Meshico Grande. He also contributed to a wider awareness of the group's goals and positions by writing, among other works, a paper entitled \\"Filosof√≠a de la acci√≥n y rese√±a del pensamiento filos√≥fico de Meshico\\" [Philosophy of Action and Review of the Philosophical Thinking of Meshico], which was originally published in the Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of Philosophy, Brussels 1953. Sarabia y Zorrilla cites, in the aforementioned work, the definition of Truth given by the obscure and retiring Mexican philosopher and mathematician Edmundo Cetina Vel√°zquez: \\"[it is knowledge] which corresponds to the integral unity of being; the world of thought will always reveal to us an external world, sensible or abstract; but always unilateral. 'Truth,' which is reality, is the patrimony of the totality of being.\\" Sarabia y Zorrilla saw in such a statement a correct testimony of faith in an epistemological holism functioning in opposition to the notion of knowledge as a goal obtainable only through a scientific vision which is essentially and necessarily ontic and a posteriori (compare the avowal made by Sarabia himself in the same text: \\"everything is related, coordinated, linked harmoniously and amorously\\"). Jos√© G√≥mez Robleda, a teacher, psychiatrist and Subsecretary of Public Education during the Adolfo Ruiz Cortines administration, published in 1947 a book titled Imagen del Mexicano (Image of the Mexican). Sarabia y Zorrilla describes the study as \\"the work which for the first time studies the way of being of the Mexican man,\\" especially in his ethnopsychological dimensions, and praises it for a vision of the human which, owing to its philosophical balance, succeeds in avoiding the worst rationalistic tendencies of Comtian Positivism, without falling into the no less problematic cosmic mysticism of Jos√© Vasconcelos (who Professor Sarabia once described, with no intended harshness, as a \\"philosopher-artist\\").

The film marks Allen's feature film directorial debut, and is notable for reuniting Allen with co-stars from many of his previous films (Sigourney Weaver from Galaxy Quest, Ray Liotta from Wild Hogs, Kelsey Grammer from Toy Story 2 and Julie Bowen from Joe Somebody). Plot Thomas Zelda (Tim Allen) has been paroled from prison for being involved in movie piracy. He is picked up by his eccentric sister Viki (Sigourney Weaver) who is revealed to be a habitual liar (she claims it's so people aren't hurt by the truth). Tommy arrives at Viki's home, where he plans to spend some time putting his life back together when it is revealed that his grandmother was told (by Viki) that he went to France instead of prison. Due to her heart condition, Tommy keeps up the story leading to a euphemism where France means \\"prison\\" (Viki's husband asks Tommy if he thinks he'll go \\"back to France\\" soon). During dinner, Gray (Ray Liotta), Tommy's old partner from the movie piracy business, shows up and his sister runs him off. The next day, Tommy meets with his parole officer, Angela Popadopolous (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who requires him to work at a pirate-themed restaurant called \\"Pirate Burger\\" as part of his parole. He informs Angela that he wants to start up his father's painting business instead, but is told that he is required to work at the restaurant. While on the job, Tommy sees Christy (Julie Bowen), his \\"dead\\" ex- girlfriend come up to the drive-through window. Realizing Viki lied to him, he takes the delivery car to see Christy leading them to spend the night together. The next morning, it is revealed that Christy is engaged to Frank (Kelsey Grammer) and Tommy is forced to escape the apartment. Since he took the delivery car without permission, Tommy is fired from \\"Pirate Burger\\" and risks going back to jail for breaking the terms of his parole. Tommy is given another chance and goes back to work. That night, Tommy is \\"kidnapped\\" by Gray and Gray tries to persuade him to get back into the piracy business. Tommy refuses stating that he wants to \\"go straight\\". Tommy is called to make a delivery. He arrives at the apartment of Angela. Her son Ethan is trying to play matchmaker to get her to start dating again. While there, Tommy notices that the apartment is in need of a paint job. Tommy decides to show Angela the kind of work he can do. With the help of two ex-con coworkers Rick and Edgar (Malcolm Goodwin and Jon Gries) from Pirate Burger, Tommy breaks into Angela's apartment while she's away and repaints the living room. Meanwhile, the fictional story about Tommy's \\"France\\" trip continues to evolve including a relationship with Simone, a French astronaut who was killed on the launchpad so that Tommy's mother would not fly everyone to France to meet her (because she does not exist). Angela is furious at Tommy for breaking and entering, but understands what he was trying to do and doesn't press charges. She sets him up to paint a judge's home. While doing the job, Angela shows up to check on Tommy's work and invites him to observe Ethan's little league team. Later, the judge's wife who is impressed by the work invites Tommy to paint the upstairs as well. While getting tools together, Edgar and Rick prepare the upstairs for painting and knock the judge's wife's diamond ring off the dresser. Wanting to do something nice for Tommy, Edgar steals the ring and gives it to Christy as a \\"gift from Tommy\\". Tommy, who doesn't know that the theft has occurred, joins Angela at the little league game and they begin to express feelings for each other. They set up a formal date. When Tommy arrives at Angela's apartment for the date, Angela is furious over the theft and demands the ring back. Tommy goes to Pirate Burger to confront Edgar and Rick, but they have disappeared. He steals the delivery car (his vehicle refuses to start) and calls Edgar and Rick. They inform him of the ring's location and he drives to Christy's house to get the ring back. After a short confrontation with Frank and Christy, he gets the ring and returns it to Angela. The manager of Pirate Burger presses charges on Tommy, and he goes back to jail. Gray shows up to bail him out and, disillusioned with his attempts to \\"go straight\\", Tommy teams back up with Gray. Meanwhile, Ethan shows up at Viki's house wanting to see Tommy but he is not there. Viki finds Tommy with Gray at the airport and makes up a story about Ethan going missing. Tommy chooses to abandon Gray at the airport (after Gray pushes Viki to the ground) to find Ethan. When he shows up at Angela's apartment, he finds out that Viki has lied to him again. Tommy's concern for the well being of her son softens Angela's animosity towards him. At the behest of Viki, Tommy invites Angela to come to a dinner at Viki's house. Angela shows up for the dinner. A story Viki told Tommy's grandmother about Angela being Tommy's \\"grief counselor\\" falls apart when Angela informs her that she is actually Tommy's parole officer, and the France story falls apart too. Viki tries to act surpirsed, but nobody buys it.

First released on the album Cold Blooded, \\"Ebony Eyes\\" climbed the R&B; charts and peaked at number 22. \\"Ebony Eyes\\" remains one of James' most notable hits as it is one of the few to not use the style he labeled \\"punk-funk\\" but instead uses a more contemporary tempo and follows a more classic style of R&B.; Robinson was credited for singing the introduction, bridge, and other more calm verses while James sang the chorus. \\"Ebony Eyes\\" begins with a simple beat which leads into a more complex rhythm and the vocals of both Robinson and uncredited background vocalist who repeat falsetto vocals twice before Robinson begins the opening verse. The song chronicles the narrators affection for a certain woman. Lost for words and made weak by the mere presence of this lady, Robinson requires James' vocals to reveal how he really feels about this woman, who James thinks is unaware of his affection and apparent need for her. It is an ode to love for women of color, hence the title \\"Ebony Eyes\\". Cover versions Silk covered the song on their 2001 album, Love Session.

He played as a fly-half and a centre. To this day, he is still considered one of the best Chilean rugby players of all time, and was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2012. His father, Colin Campbell, was a Scottish-born emigrant, businessman and amateur football player, who had played for Chile in the 1910 South American Championship. Ian Campbell followed in the rugby footsteps of his older brother Donald Campbell, a Chile international who had been killed in action in 1944 while serving with the Royal Air Force, after the war.

The city is geographically constrained, with the majority on the Island of Montreal in the Hochelaga Archipelago, and has several prominent features, including the eponymous Mount Royal. The region experiences four distinct seasons and is classified as a humid continental climate, with very cold and snowy winters and hot and humid summers.  Geographic location  Montreal is located in the southwest of the province of Quebec, approximately southwest of Quebec City, the provincial capital, and east of Ottawa, the federal capital. It also lies northeast of Toronto, northwest of Boston and directly north of New York City. The city is located on the central and eastern portions of the Island of Montreal, the largest island in the Hochelaga Archipelago, at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. The port of Montreal lies at one end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, which is the river gateway that stretches from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean. Montreal is defined by its location in between the St. Lawrence river on its south, and by the Rivi√®re des Prairies on its north. The city is named after the most prominent geographical feature on the island, a three-head hill called Mount Royal. Montreal is at the centre of the Montreal Metropolitan Community, and is bordered by the city of Laval to the north, Longueuil to the south, Repentigny to the east and the West Island municipalities to the west. The anglophone enclaves of Westmount, Montreal West, Hampstead, C√¥te Saint-Luc, the Town of Mount Royal and the francophone enclave Montreal East are all entirely surrounded by the city of Montreal.  Geology  There are ten main geological regions in Quebec: the great igneous plains of the Canadian Shield, the Appalachians in southern Quebec, and the St. Lawrence lowlands that lie between them. Covering over 95% of Quebec, the Canadian Shield contains some of the oldest igneous rocks in the world, dating back to the Precambrian period, over 1 billion years ago. The Canadian Shield is generally quite flat and exposed, punctuated by the higher relief of mountain ranges such as the Laurentians in southern Quebec. The Appalachian region of Quebec is a thin strip of weathered mountains along Quebec's southeast border. The Appalachian mountain chain is actually a long range that runs from Alabama north to Newfoundland. The St. Lawrence lowlands are comparatively tiny in size (about ) but disproportionately important in that they contain most of the human population of Quebec. The lowlands actually consist of three parts: the central lowlands, or the St. Lawrence Plain, a wide and flat triangle extending from Cornwall to Quebec City. The St. Lawrence Plain is almost entirely flat because of the clay deposits left behind by the Champlain Sea (which once covered all of Montreal).  Street directions  One quirk of common Montreal parlance is that directions (north, south, east, and west) along the street grid are sharply skewed relative to the actual compass directions. The St. Lawrence River is taken as flowing west to east (even though it flows north or northeast past the island), so that directions along streets parallel to the river are referred to as \\"west\\" and \\"east,\\" and those along streets perpendicular to the river, \\"north\\" and \\"south.\\" In much of Montreal, \\"north\\" is actually northwest, and in some areas such as Verdun and Pointe-aux-Trembles it is actually due west. \\"Montreal directions\\" are used in naming street addresses and describing bus routes, among other things. As a result of this discrepancy, Montreal has been called \\"the only city where the sun sets in the north.\\" Further folk naming customs include giving directions involving going \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" streets that are perpendicular to the river; \\"up\\" being towards Mount Royal and \\"down\\" being towards the St. Lawrence. But the system can be confused on the north side of the mountain (whether \\"up\\" means uphill, i.e. Montreal \\"south,\\" or towards Montreal \\"north\\" as it does downtown).Chodos, Alan. Welcome to Montr√©al, Where Down is Up and the Sun Sets in the North. APS Physics. Accessed July 1, 2011. Streets are named \\"Ouest\\" or \\"Est\\" when they cross Saint Laurent Boulevard. Street numbers rise eastward and westward from Saint Laurent Boulevard, and northward from the St. Lawrence River and the Lachine Canal. (A few streets in Le Sud-Ouest borough, such as rue Charlevoix, cross the Lachine Canal. In those cases, the addresses south of the Lachine Canal have an \\"O\\" prefixed to their street numbers.)  Climate  Montreal lies at the confluence of several climatic regions. Usually, the climate is classified as humid continental or hemiboreal (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa). Precipitation is abundant with an average snowfall of per year in the winter. Regular rainfall throughout the year averages . Summer is the wettest season statistically, but it is also the sunniest. The coldest month of the year is January, with a daily average temperature of ‚Äî averaging a daily low of , colder than either Moscow () or Saint Petersburg (). Due to wind chill, the perceived temperature can be much lower than the actual temperature, and wind chill factor is often included in Montreal weather forecasts. The warmest month is July with an average daily high of ; lower nighttime temperatures make an average of , thus air exchangers often achieve the same result as air conditioners. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 15 January 1957 and the highest temperature ever was on 1 August 1975. High humidity is common in the summer, which makes the perceived temperature higher than the actual temperature. In spring and autumn, rainfall averages between a month. Some snow in spring and autumn is normal. Similarly, late heat waves as well as \\"Indian summers\\" are a regular feature of the climate. 2006 was noted as the only year in the history of Montreal when there was more rain than there was snow. There were of snow, and there were of rain. That year, Montreal received more rain than Vancouver, British Columbia.Montreal Monthly Data Report for 2006 Montreal is ranked 160 out of 190 world cities in the 2018 STC Climate index, a ranking of the best climates to live and work in.The STC 2018 Climate Index  Winter  Winter in Montreal is often cold and snowy, and can be windy at times. Most days stay near or below freezing, and temperatures remain well below freezing at night. Sometimes with windchill, temperatures may feel colder than the actual temperature. Typical winter daytime temperatures are between and overnight temperatures are between . Temperatures in the downtown core can be warmer than those in the northwestern suburbs by up to due to the urban heat island effect. Some days are milder with temperatures staying well above freezing; conversely, night temperatures occasionally plunge below , especially with windchill. Montreal receives plenty of snow throughout the winter season. Snow mainly falls between early December and early March, although it mostly snows in January and February. Although it is rare, light snow could fall in late October and April. Average yearly snowfall is . Despite plenty of snow during winter, Montreal is seeing an increasing amount of rain rather than snow during the winter. But Montreal still sees plenty of days with sunshine compared to other places at similar latitudes, or even farther south, and more winter sunshine than anywhere in northern and northwestern Europe. Precipitation occurs between 13 and 17 days per month, including an average of 59 days of snowfall.  Spring  Spring in Montreal ranges from chilly to warm weather. Spring-like weather, by Montreal standards, usually arrives in mid-March, sometimes earlier or later, with temperatures around , but the weather is very unpredictable. April brings temperatures between , but hot humid weather and snow are possible in the same week. Trees usually start leafing out during the last week of the month. May is a rather warm month. Temperatures are usually in the high teens ¬∞C (60's ¬∞F) during the first week, but by the last week of the month the weather is warm enough to herald warm summer days, with temperatures around . Spring is also slightly sunnier than autumn. Precipitation occurs on average between 12 and 14 days per month.  Summer  The summer months of June all the way to mid-September bring warm and hot humid weather. Average daytime temperatures stay between and overnight temperatures around . However, temperatures reach and even exceed on many days; combined with high humidity, it feels much hotter. Some nights, temperatures remain at an uncomfortable . While summer is the sunniest season, short-lived thunderstorms are also common. Rain typically occurs on average between 12 and 13 days per month.  Autumn  Temperatures start to cool off towards the end of September, allowing for brilliant fall foliage in October. Daytime temperatures in October are around , and in November hover at . Late autumn receives slightly less sunshine than early spring. Autumn usually turns to winter in early December. Precipitation occurs on average between 12 and 15 days per month.  Sunshine  Montreal and the southern Quebec region receive slightly over 2,000 hours of sunshine annually, with summer being the sunniest season. The sunniest month is July with 272 hours, and the least sunny is December with 84 hours. Montreal receives more sunshine than northern and northwestern Europe, even in locations at similar or even somewhat farther south latitudes, especially during winter.  Precipitation  The city's average annual precipitation is , including of rain and of snow. As in the Northeastern U.S. and most of Southeastern Canada, precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year, with no wet or dry seasons. Montreal has 163 days annually with some rain or snow. Thunderstorms can occur any time between late spring and early autumn.

He was the founding member of the New World Guitar Trio and is recognized as a solo performer and arranger.  Biography  David Patterson was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father, John Patterson, was an amateur pianist and organist. His mother emigrated from Cuba in the late 1950s and became a school teacher in Rumson, New Jersey where she met John Patterson. David Patterson attended several schools in his youth including boarding school, which he later left to more seriously pursue musical studies. As a youth, Patterson studied piano and violin as well as the guitar. Among his many teachers were jazz guitarist Harry Leahey, theorist and arranger Dr. Henry Melnik, and classical guitarist Francis Perry. He went on to study at New England Conservatory of Music, where he received both his bachelor's and master's degree with distinction in classical guitar performance. His teachers were David Leisner and Neil Anderson. Patterson's influences include: Jimmy Page, John McLaughlin, Julian Bream, John Williams, Miles Davis, Jeff Beck, Paco de Lucia, Beethoven, Bach, and Heitor Villa-Lobos.  The New World Guitar Trio  In 1988, Patterson founded the New World Guitar Trio, a group dedicated to commissioning and performing new music as well as creating original arrangements of the standard repertoire. As the group‚Äôs producer and arranger, Patterson was praised for his innovative programming and his ‚Äúingenious transcriptions of solo piano, chamber, and orchestral works\\" (Guitar Player magazine). His approach merged the traditional genres of Beethoven and the folk music of Portugal, with the sounds of late 20th-century repertoire. Patterson has collaborated with such composers as Osvaldo Golijov, Claudio Ragazzi, Chiel Meijering, David Leisner, and Dana Brayton on works commissioned by the Trio. The ensemble was praised for its recordings: ‚ÄúIndeed, what‚Äôs remarkable‚Ä¶is how fluidly and fluently the New World Guitar Trio makes this program seem idiomatic to three guitars, while providing a refreshing new perspective on the music itself‚Äù (Audio Magazine). Between 1988 and 1997, the members of the Trio included David Patterson, Dean Harada, and Thomas Noren. Harada left the group and was replaced by Thomas Rhode in the summer of 1997. After 15 years of success, the Trio members disbanded in 2003 to pursue individual projects.  Solo career  In addition to his work with the New World Guitar Trio, Patterson has maintained an active solo career, performing with such ensembles as the Auros Group for New Music, Boston Musica Viva, the Boston University Chamber Orchestra, the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Opera Boston, and the Fromm Players for the Harvard Group for New Music as an artist-in-residence. He has been a guest artist at the Tanglewood Music Festival and Bowdoin International Music Festival. In 2003, Patterson collaborated with composer Osvaldo Golijov and soprano Dawn Upshaw as an arranger and performer in the world premiere of the opera Ainadamar under the baton of Robert Spano at Tanglewood. He was a performer in the Boston premiere of Ainadamar in 2007, with Opera Boston under the baton of Gil Rose and renowned director Peter Sellars. In 2008, Patterson was a guest artist at the Longy School of Music‚Äôs tribute to the 100th birthday of legendary American composer, Elliott Carter. He performed Changes, Carter‚Äôs most important work for the classical guitar.  Discography  David Patterson can be heard on two New World Guitar Trio recordings: the eponymous New World Guitar Trio (1994) and Exiled (2000). In 2005, his debut solo recording, Esordio was released featuring the music of Bach, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Leo Brouwer, Johann Kaspar Mertz, and Ginastera. Patterson‚Äôs work for guitar includes his 2003 recording of Jimmy Page‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhite Summer/Black Mountainside‚Äù, featured in a compilation CD Guitar Harvest alongside guitarists Andy Summers, Bill Frisell, and Ralph Towner, among others.

He was the only classical composer to survive the concentration camp in Theresienstadt.All About Jewish Theatre - Come to the Thereisenstadt cabaret  Life  He was born in ≈Ωatec, Bohemia into a Jewish family. His father Josef was a kantor in ≈Ωatec's synagogue. He studied law, and acquired his doctorate in 1934. In 1929 he also studied composition privately with Alois H√°ba and composed Fantasia for Quarter - tone piano. In 1931 he graduated from the Master School of Composition with Orchestral suite, as a student of Josef Suk. Reiner was also a concert pianist who cooperated with Theatre of Emil Franti≈°ek Burian (1934‚Äì38). During World War II; he was imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, first in Theresienstadt (deported on 7 July 1943), he participated in musical activities there, created incidental music for the play Esther, directed by Norbert Fr√Ωd. Later, on 28 September 1944, he was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, afterwards to Landsberg and finally to Kaufering, a subcamp of the Dachau camp. Following the death march and liberation he returned to Prague, where he reunited with his wife Hana (she also survived the imprisonment in concentration camps). He had problems with gaining his Czech citizenship after the war, even though as an adult he considered himself always as a Czech, not a Jew or German.Kuna, p. 167 He began to participate in music life again, but soon after the communist Victorious February in 1948 he was accused of formalism. Reiner was member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia since 1948, but he left in 1969.Kuna, p. 382 He died in Prague in 1979.Kuna, p. 378  Style  Reiner's musical output was created during fifty years, since 1928/9 to 1979, and was firmly connected with the political situation in Czechoslovakia in the 20th century.Kuna, p. 379-380 His first artistic period was influenced by his teachers and models (Alois H√°ba, Josef Suk, Emil Franti≈°ek Burian, and Erwin Schulhoff), it was part of Czech artistic avant-garde, and it was later rejected by communists as formalism.Kuna, p. 379 After the critique of the party he was forced to find new, more traditional and conservative ways of composing. This period lasted roughly to 1960. The last period (1960‚Äì79) is considered the most artistically valuable. The musical trends in Czechoslovakia were freer in that time and Reiner thus was able to show his expressive musical thinking. He composed almost in all musical categories, created vocal works (songs, choirs), instrumental works (for solo instrument, chamber, symphonic), vocal- instrumental works (cantata, opera), film music, incidental music, composed popular dance songs at the start of his career, and was inspired also by jazz and folk music. He composed for almost all instruments, including bass clarinet, dulcimer, solo drums and for baritone saxophone.

It is the region's only nationally verified Level I Trauma Center. In 1998, it became an independent entity that receives no funding from the state of Kansas. The hospital is affiliated with the University of Kansas Medical Center, which comprises the schools of medicine, nursing and allied health. The University of Kansas Health System combines education, research and patient care. Physicians represent more than 200 specialties. The center has 910 staffed beds; per year, there are 298,920 outpatient visits, 27,380 inpatient admissions and 47,771 emergency department visits. The center performs annually 10,124 inpatient and 8,743 outpatient surgeries. History Originally apart of the University of Kansas, the School of Medicine in Lawrence began as a one-year premedical course in 1880 and then offered a two- year course in 1899. It became a four-year school on April 21, 1905, when three private medical schools in the Kansas City area merged: the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Kansas City Medical College and the Medico- Chirurgical College. In 1906, Dr. Simeon Bishop Bell donated the land and cash totaling more than $100,000 to establish the original Eleanor Taylor Bell Hospital, in honor of his wife. That same year, the School of Medicine moved into the hospital, located on \\"Goat Hill\\" in Rosedale, at what is now Southwest Boulevard and 7th Street, in Kansas City, Kansas. Basic sciences were still taught in Lawrence, while clinical studies were taught at the Rosedale facility. A School of Nursing was also established in 1906. In the early 1920s, the medical school moved south to its present location at 39th and Rainbow Boulevard, and in the late 1940s, it was renamed the University of Kansas Medical Center. During the 1960s and 1970s, all studies moved to Kansas City, the School of Allied Health was established, and a new hospital officially opened in 1979. In 1998, the hospital became an independent Hospital Authority, receiving no state funding. The hospital's official name is \\"The University of Kansas Health System\\" as it now incorporates more than 80 campuses across the Kansas City Metro. A sixth-floor was added to the hospital in 2003 to meet a growing demand for patient services. An expanded and renovated Cancer Center and new Breast Center, both featuring the latest technology and many patient amenities, opened that same year. Also in 2003, construction began on the Center for Advanced Heart Care, an expertly designed cardiac complex focused on serving the needs of patients and families, from curbside to bedside. The Health System has partnered with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals to provide healthcare.

Begun in the 1880s, it is now managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, and provides irrigation water to a large area around Carlsbad, diverted from the Pecos River and the Black River. The late 19th and early 20th-century elements of the project were designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1964. and History and description The city of Carlsbad is located in the northern reaches of the Chihuahuan Desert. In order to work this area agriculturally settlers arriving in the late 19th century turned to irrigation to provide water for their crops. By the late 1880s, this resulted in a patchwork of private canals irrigating small patches of land. Charles B. Eddy and Pat Garrett, two local ranchers and businessmen, hatched the idea of a larger and more organized corporate-run irrigation system to serve the entire lower Pecos River valley. The project got underway in 1889, when construction began on the Avalon Dam, which now serves as a diversion and regulation point for the system. In 1893 the Avalon Dam had to be rebuilt after its destruction in a flash flood, and the McMillan Dam was built further upriver as a major storage facility. The Avalon Dam was once again destroyed by flooding in 1903, sending the system into effective bankruptcy. It was then taken over by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, which completed reconstruction of the Avalon Dam in 1907, and has overseen the project since. The system has since then been augmented by the Brantley Dam, which now serves as its primary storage, and a dam on the Black River near Malaga that provides additional capacity in that area. In addition to the two major dams, the district manages the major canals that distribute water to users, and the various gatehouses that control water flow. Its offices are located in the First Bank of Eddy building in downtown Carlsbad.

Bertram Fletcher Robinson (22 August 1870 ‚Äì 21 January 1907) was an English sportsman, journalist, author and Liberal Unionist Party campaigner. Between 1893 and 1907, he wrote nearly three hundred items, including a series of short stories that feature a detective called \\"Addington Peace\\". However, Robinson is perhaps best remembered for his literary collaborations with his friends Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äì BFRonline.BIZ and P. G. Wodehouse. Early life and family Bertram Fletcher Robinson (affectionately referred to as either 'Bobbles' or 'Bertie') was born on 22 August 1870 at 80 Rose Lane, Mossley Hill, Liverpool. In early 1882, he relocated with his family to Park Hill House at Ipplepen in Devon. His father, Joseph Fletcher Robinson (1827‚Äì1903), was the founder of a general merchant business in Liverpool (c. 1867). Around 1850, Joseph travelled to South America and was befriended by Giuseppe Garibaldi. Thereafter, he fought in the Guerra Grande alongside Garibaldi and the Uruguayans against the Argentine dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas. Robinson's uncle, Sir John Richard Robinson (1828‚Äì1903), was the long-time editor-in-chief of the Daily News and a prominent committee member of the Liberal Reform Club. Bertram Fletcher Robinson was educated at Newton Abbot Proprietary College (1882‚Äì1890) and Jesus College, Cambridge (1890‚Äì1894). Other notable 'Old Newtonians' include the writer Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and the explorer Lieutenant Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. Robinson won three Rugby Football Blues between 1891 and 1893 and, according to his obituary in the Daily Express (22 January 1907), he would have played for England but for an \\"accident\\". He also rowed for Jesus College and was a member of the crew that won the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta on 7 July 1892. On 12 February 1894, The Times reported that Robinson was tried for the position of fourth oar with the Cambridge 'Trial Eight' ahead of the fifty-first annual Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. Jesus College awarded Robinson with a Second Class History Tripos Bachelor of Arts degree (1893), Part I of the Law Tripos Bachelor of Arts degree (1894) and a Master of Arts degree (1897). Robinson became a barrister in June 1896 but he never practised that profession. On 3 June 1902, 31‚Äëyear‚Äëold Robinson married 22-year-old Gladys Hill Morris at St. Barnabas Church, Kensington, London. Gladys was a self-proclaimed 'actress' and a daughter of the noted Victorian artist Philip Richard Morris (1833‚Äì1902). The couple had no children of their own. However, the Robinsons acted as godparents to Geraldine Winn Everett, the daughter of Percy Everett. Writing and editorial career The Chronicles of Addington Peace by Bertram Fletcher Robinson (London: Harper & Brother, June 1905) Bertram Fletcher Robinson held editorial positions with The Newtonian (1887‚Äì1889), The Granta (1893‚Äì1895), The Isthmian Library (1897‚Äì1901), Daily Express (July 1900 ‚Äì May 1904), Vanity Fair (May 1904 ‚Äì October 1906), The World, a journal for Men and Women (October 1906 ‚Äì January 1907), and the Gentleman's Magazine (January 1907). Between 1893 and 1907, Robinson wrote or coauthored at least nine satirical playlets (including four with his friend, PG Wodehouse), fifty-four short stories (including seven with his friend, Sir Malcolm Fraser, 1st Baronet), four lyrics, forty-four articles (for fifteen different periodicals), one hundred and twenty-eight newspaper reports, twenty-four poems and eight books. He also edited eight books about various sports and pastimes for The Isthmian Library (1897‚Äì1901). In July 1900, Robinson and the creator of Sherlock Holmes, (Sir) Arthur Conan Doyle, 'cemented' their friendship while aboard a passenger ship that was travelling to Southampton from Cape Town. The following year, Robinson told Doyle legends of ghostly hounds, recounted the supernatural tale of Squire Richard Cabell III and showed him around grimly atmospheric Dartmoor. The pair had previously agreed to co-author a Devon-based story but in the end, their collaboration led only to Doyle's celebrated novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Robinson also contributed an idea to the plot of a Sherlock Holmes short-story entitled \\"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\\", which was first published in Collier's Weekly on 31 October 1903., ‚Äì BBC Radio Wales Doyle is sometimes seen as downplaying the importance of Robinson's contribution to The Hound of the Baskervilles. The literary scholar and critic, Professor William Wallace Robson wrote that it is 'impossible to determine' the precise extent of Robinson's role, but in all probability he merely acted as a 'creative trigger'. He adds that once the element of Sherlock Holmes was added to the original idea, the novel evolved beyond the joint project that was originally posited. Robinson himself conceded that his part in the collaboration was restricted to that of an 'assistant plot producer'. Death The grave of Bertram Fletcher Robinson at St. Andrew's Church in Ipplepen, Devon Bertram Fletcher Robinson died aged just 36 years and 153 days on 21 January 1907, at 44 Eaton Terrace, Belgravia, London. The official cause of his death is recorded as 'enteric fever (3 weeks) and peritonitis (24 hours)'. Others with a bent for the occult attributed his death to a curse linked with an Egyptian artefact called the Unlucky Mummy.‚Äì Fletcher Robinson & the 'Mummy' (Part I) by Paul R Spiring, ‚Äì Fletcher Robinson & the 'Mummy' (Part II) by Paul R Spiring, ‚Äì The Atlanta Constitution newspaper, 19 June 1904 at BFRonline.biz Robinson was buried beside his parents at St. Andrew's Church, Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot in Devon. Obituaries were published in The World, The Times, Daily Express, The Western Guardian, The Western Morning News, The Sphere, The Athenaeum, The Illustrated London News, The Mid-Devon and Newton Times, Vanity Fair, The Book of Blues and the Annual Report of the Jesus College Cambridge Society (1907). The English poet and journalist, Jessie Pope also wrote the following eulogy to Robinson, which was published in the Daily Express newspaper on Saturday 26 January 1907: Memorial service Alfred Harmsworth employed Bertram Fletcher Robinson at the time of his death. At 4pm on Thursday 24 January 1907, The Reverend Septimus Pennington conducted a memorial service for Robinson at St. Clement Danes, Strand, London. According to a report in the Daily Express newspaper (Saturday 26 January 1907), the congregation included the following notable figures: Arthur Hammond Marshall, Owen Seaman, Max Pemberton, Cyril Arthur Pearson, Percy Everett, Alfred Harmsworth, Joseph Lawrence, Sir Felix Sermon, Sir William Bell (former member of the British Iron Trade Association & tax-reform campaigner), Anthony Hope, Clement King Shorter, Gerald Fitzgerald Campbell, Leslie Ward ('Spy'), Thomas Anstey Guthrie, Evelyn Wrench and Henry Hamilton Fyfe. The congregation sang a hymn entitled Peace, Perfect Peace. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was unable to attend either the funeral or the memorial service because he was at that time, busily campaigning for the release from prison of one George Edalji. He did however send a floral tribute to the funeral service in Ipplepen with a message that read \\"In loving memory of an old and valued friend from Arthur Conan Doyle\\". Legacy In 1908, the British author Max Pemberton had a story entitled Wheels of Anarchy published by Cassell & Company (London). This story is based upon notes that were written by Robinson shortly before his death. It is an adventure tale about anarchists and assassins that is set across Europe. The novel's hero, Bruce Driscoll, is a recent graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge and he appears to be modelled upon Robinson. Wheels of Anarchy by Max Pemberton was republished in facsimile form in December 2010 In 1909, Gladys Robinson sold both Park Hill House and 44 Eaton Terrace and she then appears to have moved to continental Europe. During World War I, Gladys met Major William John Frederick Halliday (Distinguished Service Order), a Royal Artillery officer born in London in 1882 and affectionately referred to as \\"Fred\\". The couple got married at the British Diplomatic mission in Paris on 7 January 1918 and thereafter, they relocated to Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. In October 1912, Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World was published. This story is narrated by a character named Edward E. Malone. It is possible that Malone is also partially modelled upon Robinson. Like Robinson, Malone was raised in the West Country, became an accomplished rugby union player, worked as a London-based journalist and loved a woman called Gladys. In 1951, Robinson's book entitled The Chronicles of Addington Peace (London: Harper & Brother, 1905) was listed in the influential Queen's Quorum: A History of the Detective-Crime Short Story as Revealed by the 106 Most Important Books Published in this Field Since 1845.See both Ellery Queen & In January 2009, Ipplepen Parish Council gave permission for a commemorative bench and plaque to be situated outside Caunters Close in Ipplepen. The inscription on the plaque reads as follows: 'Bertram Fletcher Robinson (1870‚Äì1907). Journalist, Editor, Author and former resident of Ipplepen. He assisted Arthur Conan Doyle with The Hound of the Baskervilles'.http://www.ipplepenparishcouncil.gov.uk/Uploads/Site890/Files/jan.09.doc and In June 2010, Brian Pugh, Paul Spiring and Sadru Bhanji had a book published that is entitled Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and Devon. This book contends that the success of Sherlock Holmes is partly attributable to Bertram Fletcher Robinson and two other former Devon residents called George Turnavine Budd and George Newnes. On 1 September 2011, Short Books Ltd. released a novel entitled The Baskerville Legacy by John O'Connell. The book presents a highly fictionalised account of the circumstances that led Arthur Conan Doyle and Bertram Fletcher Robinson to conceive The Hound of the Baskervilles.

Tecnu is made from deodorized mineral spirits, water, propylene glycol, octylphenoxy-polythoxethanol, mixed fatty acid soap, and fragrance. History The cleanser was invented by former Mead Johnson executive and chemist Dr. Robert Smith during the early 1960s. Tecnu, for \\"Technically New,\\" was intended to remove radioactive fallout dust from skin. Several years later, his wife discovered another use for the cleanser. After an exposure to poison oak, she washed with Tecnu and did not get urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. In 1977 the company began to market Tecnu to foresters, firefighters, surveyors, and utility crews. It has since become a popular remedy for gardeners and others who live and work around poison ivy.

It was one of the oldest monasteries in Norway, and also one of the wealthiest and best- documented. There are no visible remains today. History Munkeliv Abbey was founded as a Benedictine abbey by King Eystein I of Norway (√òystein 1 Magnusson, reigned 1103‚Äì 1123) in about 1110 and was dedicated to Saint Michael. The abbey was strategically positioned on the dominant height of Nordnes over the then newly established town of Bergen, with a view to encouraging the town's development. Its first centuries were successful and prosperous, but the arrival of the Black Death in the mid-14th century brought about a decline. In addition, the buildings suffered great damage in 1393 when the abbey was attacked by pirates known as the Victual Brothers (vitaliebr√∏drene). Thanks to its great wealth it managed to survive these catastrophes, but could not avoid a further decline. In the 1420s it was taken over by the Bridgettines, with the Pope's approval, and was occupied as a double house by both monks and nuns. This was a very disturbed period: the abbey was again damaged by fire in 1455, when it was attacked by Hanseatic merchants pursuing Olav Nilsson, commander of the royal castle in Bergen, who had sought sanctuary in the abbey. Both Olav Nilsson and Leif Thor Olafsson, Bishop of Bergen, died during the attack. During the 1460s, the occupants of Munkeliv were obliged to seek shelter in Hoved√∏ya Abbey in Oslo. The monastery was re-constructed by the Cistercian Order and reoccupied by the Bridgettines in 1480. When the abbey was suppressed during the Protestant Reformation, the Bishop of Bergen took it over for his residence and used the church as the cathedral of Bergen. The entire building complex however was destroyed by fire in 1536. The monks' herb garden near Puddefjord was later cultivated by the Bergen pharmacist, L√∏veapoteket, for medicinal plants until the surrounding areas were built up in the 19th century. Site and buildings The monastery remains today are beneath the open space known as \\"the Monastery\\" (Klosteret) at Nordnes, near numbers 2-6, and nothing is visible. Excavations of the site took place in 1857 and 1860, during which many extremely well crafted structural fragments were recovered. These artifacts are now in the Museum of Cultural History (Kulturhistorisk Museum), part of Bergen Museum. These include the well-known marble head of King Eystein I discovered by Nicolay Nicolaysen, supposedly the oldest-known portrait of a Norwegian. At that time there were still remains of walls above ground up to a height of roughly 2.4 metres, but these were demolished after the excavations. The church was approximately 32 metres in length and 11 metres wide, consisting of a single aisle the same width as the choir, which ended in an apse at the east end and also a crypt. A west tower was added in the 13th century. The conventual buildings were to the south of the church. Presumably under the Bridgettines, who carried out extensive building alterations, the cloisters were incorporated into the church.

History  The town of Thornton developed during the 1820s, and in 1833 was established as Henrysville (or Henry's Corners) after early settler John Henry, who was the first teacher and then the schoolmaster, and later became the postmaster when an office opened in 1854. The name Henrysville caused confusion in the mail system at the time, so the community became Thornton in 1854 after Henry Thornton, who owned a grist mill, saw mill and planning mill. Recent history Thornton has had two subdivisions built within the hamlet in the last 10 years. As of January 2019, there is a new residential subdivision of estate homes currently under development on the west side of Hwy. 27 (Barrie Street).

It is also the historic population center of Nevada, with the state capital in Carson City, the University of Nevada in Reno and several state historic parks, notably Mormon Station State Historic Park in Genoa, the state's first permanent European settlement. Geography Western Nevada encompasses the western edge of the state, with the term generally applied to areas within of the California border, from Mineral County northward. On the west along the California border, the Sierra Nevada mountains rise sharply from the Great Basin desert floor. Basin and Range Province topography extends east from the Sierras, with mountain ranges such as the Virginia Range, Pah Rah Range and Pine Nut Mountains separating the more densely populated Sierra front with the desert plains to the east. The mountains act as a second rain shadow for Pacific storms rolling east. Three rivers flow off the Sierras to the Great Basin ‚Äî the Truckee River, Carson River and Walker River. The Truckee Canyon through the Virginia and Pah Rah mountains serves as the route for Interstate 80 between Fernley and Reno. Pyramid Lake and Washoe Lake collect water in their respective endorheic basins, and Lake Lahontan impounds the Carson River to distribute water for irrigation in Churchill County. Transportation The main roads in the region are Interstate 80, U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 395. US 395 runs from the Los Angeles area to the Pacific Northwest along the eastern Sierras and is a freeway for about 51 of its through Nevada. Part of US 395 is also I-580. About 35,000 cars daily use I-580 and US 395 between Reno and Carson City. I-80 is the main east-west route through the region, connecting with Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area to the west and the Great Basin and Salt Lake City to the east. It also connects the rapidly growing community of Fernley with Reno and serves as a route to access the resort communities at Lake Tahoe.

In his thirty-year tenure at the FBI, Coulson created and commanded the FBI‚Äôs Hostage Rescue Team and commanded four field divisions. As of Spring 2009, Danny Coulson is a successful security consultant, author, and guest speaker. History Danny received his bachelor's degree in Government from Texas Christian University. He then attended Southern Methodist University where he earned his Law Degree. He passed the Texas Bar. Coulson worked for the next nine years in the FBI's New York Division, where he specialized in Police Assassination, Fugitive, and Bank Robbery Investigations. Additionally he served on the FBI's Sniper Team and commanded one of the most active SWAT Teams in the FBI. In 1982, after a rise through the ranks of the FBI, Coulson was assigned to create the Hostage Rescue Team (HRT). While in command of HRT, Coulson personally negotiated the surrender of domestic terrorists at Mountain Home, AR, without any loss of life. For his actions, Coulson received the Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service. In 1984, Coulson led a team of FBI agents to Whidbey Island to arrest Robert Jay Mathews, the leader of the neo-Nazi terrorist group The Order. Mathews was killed in the resulting shootout. In 1986 Coulson was the Inspector In Charge of the Iran Contra Investigation for the FBI and later headed up the same investigation for Independent Counsel Judge Lawrence Walsh. In 1987, Coulson was the tactical commander at the Atlanta Prison Riots. That situation culminated with the release of over a hundred hostages. He has secured the release of over two hundred and seventy five hostages in his career. As deputy assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Investigation Division, Coulson managed all investigations of violent crimes, and terrorism worldwide, as well as civil rights and special inquiries for the White House. As Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the FBI office in Dallas, Texas, he was detailed as one of the Commanders of the Oklahoma City bombing investigation.

Adopted and proclaimed by the Frankfurt Parliament after the Revolutions of 1848, the constitution contained a charter of fundamental rights and a democratic government in the form of a constitutional monarchy. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was designated head of state as \\"Emperor of the Germans\\" (Kaiser der Deutschen), a role he rejected. The constitution is called by its more common names in order to distinguish it from the Constitution of the German Empire enacted in 1871 and initiated by Otto von Bismarck. Emergence The 1849 Constitution was proclaimed by the Frankfurt Parliament, during its meeting in the Paulskirche church on 27 March 1849, and came in effect on 28 March,Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs (\\"Paulskirchenverfassung\\") vom 28. M√§rz 1849 when it was published in the Reichs-Gesetz-Blatt 1849, pp. 101‚Äì147. Thus, a united German Empire, as successor to the German Confederation, had been founded de jure. De facto, however, most Princes on German soil were not willing to give up sovereignty and resisted it, so it did not succeed on land, with the German Confederation being restored a year later. On the other hand, this first and democratic German Empire, with its small Reichsflotte (Imperial Fleet) founded a year earlier, fought the First War of Schleswig at sea with the Battle of Heligoland. The fleet's black-red-gold war ensign was one of the first instances of the official use of the modern republican Flag of Germany. After long and controversial negotiations, the parliament had passed the complete Imperial Constitution on 27 March 1849. It was carried narrowly, by 267 against 263 votes. The version passed included the creation of a hereditary emperor (Erbkaisertum), which had been favoured mainly by the erbkaiserliche group around Gagern, with the reluctant support of the Westendhall group around Heinrich Simon. On the first reading, such a solution had been dismissed. The change of mind came about because all alternative suggestions, such as an elective monarchy, or a Directory government under an alternating chair were even less practicable and unable to find broad support, as was the radical left's demand for a republic, modelled on the United States. The constitution's text opens with ¬ß 1 Sentence 1: \\"Das deutsche Reich besteht aus dem Gebiete des bisherigen deutschen Bundes.\\" (\\"The German Empire consists of the area of the hitherto existing German Confederation\\"). The Frankfurt deputies had to answer the German question, i.e. the debate whether a unified Germany should comprise those Austrian crown lands included in the Confederation's territory or not. As the Habsburg emperors would never renounce any constituent lands of their multinational state, the delegates with the designation of King Frederick William IV opted for a Prussian-led \\"Lesser German solution\\" (Kleindeutsche L√∂sung), though the Constitution explicitly reserved the participation of the Austrian lands. The German people were to be represented by a bicameral parliament, with a directly elected Volkshaus (House of commons), and a Staatenhaus (House of States) of representatives sent by the individual confederated states. Half of each Staatenhaus delegation was to be appointed by the respective state government, the other by the state parliament. Sections 178 and 179 called, at one and the same time, for public trials, oral criminal proceedings, and jury trials for the \\"more serious crimes and all political offenses.\\" The introduction of the jury trial was followed by its adoption by the overwhelming majority of German states, and continued with the German Empire Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz (GVG) of 27 January 1877, and would last until the Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924 during the Weimar Republic.

It is a modest single-story adobe structure, built in 1825, that is an east-facing U shape with a central courtyard. The oldest portion of the house consists of the front three rooms, and the next room to the north. The interior of these rooms has been furnished in the Spanish Colonial and Territorial styles of the Carson period, while other rooms house museum offices and displays. The house in the 2000s Kit Carson grew up in the frontier west, and became renowned as a fur trapper and guide on numerous United States Army expeditions against Native Americans and also during the American Civil War. In 1843 he married Josefa Jarmillo, who was from a leading Taos family, and purchased this house. It remained the couple's principal home until 1868. They were away from it 1851-54 and 1866‚Äì67, when Carson was stationed elsewhere. In early 1868 the family moved to the Colorado Territory, where both died.

He was also instrumental in protecting wolves from eradication and in preserving the biological integrity of the Denali National Park and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In 1989 Professor John A. Murray of the English Department at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks received an NEH grant to inventory the extensive Adolph Murie written and slide archives at Rasmusson Library in the Arctic and Polar Collection. He wrote a forty-page report and biographical narrative of Adolph Murie, which remains unpublished but which is in his papers. Early life Adolf Winstrom was born on September 6, 1899, in Moorhead, Minnesota, the child of Ed and Marie Winstrom.Joachim Murie died in 1895. His widow, Marie, married Ed Winstrom, their son Adolf was born in 1899, Winstrom died shortly thereafter, and Marie resumed using the surname 'Murie.' Once he was old enough, Adolf legally changed his surname to Murie to match his half-brother and mother and subsequently began spelling his first name 'Adolph.' See: In 1922, prior to completing college, Adolph Murie joined his brother, Olaus Murie, on an expedition to Mt. McKinley National Park, the first of many trips he would make to Alaska to do biological research. Murie received a bachelor's degree from Concordia College, and attended graduate school at the University of Michigan, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1929. He subsequently worked on projects for the university's Zoology Museum, among other things doing research on mammals in Guatemala and British Honduras. Books and articles In 1934, Adolph Murie went to work for the Wildlife Division of the National Park Service. In total, he would spend the better part of thirty-two years working for the National Park Service and earned the National Park Service Distinguished Service Award. In 1937, Murie conducted a study of coyotes in Yellowstone National Park, published as Ecology of the Coyote in Yellowstone. This book set off a storm of controversy within the Service, and represents one of the first studies published that argued against the Service's long tradition of predator eradication. In 1939, the National Park Service assigned Murie to assess the relationship between the Dall sheep and the wolf in the Mount McKinley area. The resulting book, The Wolves of Mt. McKinley, is considered a classic, especially given the detailed field observations which Murie spent hours collecting from 1939‚Äì1941, including the discovery that wolves ate mice. The publication of these two works led directly to the termination of the predator eradication programs in Yellowstone and Mount McKinley national parks. He based himself in 1939 at Sanctuary River Cabin No. 31, in Denali park, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Service, research and wildlife organizations Along with his brother, Olaus, Murie helped to enlarge existing national park boundaries and to create additional new units, notably the Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943 (it was upgraded to national park status several years later, then incorporated into the Grand Teton National Park). Murie's book, A Naturalist in Alaska, won the John Burroughs Medal in 1963. In addition to his books, Murie published numerous articles against predator control programs and excessive human intrusion on wilderness areas. He wrote letters and submitted testimony to Congress regarding Isle Royale, Jackson Hole, Mount McKinley, and other wilderness areas threatened by development or predator control programs, including an article against pesticide use in Grand Teton National Park in 1966. Legacy Adolph Murie suffered from epilepsy and died from a seizure on August 16, 1974, at the STS Ranch, now part of the Murie Ranch Historic District in Moose, Wyoming. The ranch was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998, and the house and grounds are the headquarters for the Murie Center, a non-profit organization which, in partnership with Grand Teton National Park, engages people to understand and commit to conserving wildlife and wild places‚Äîthe same values to which the Muries dedicated their lives. In 1976 the Stanford University Law School established the \\"Olaus and Adolph Murie Award\\" for the best work done by a student in Environmental Law, and continues to give the award annually. The Murie Science and Learning Center in Denali National Park was opened and officially dedicated to Adolph Murie on August 16, 2004. The center is open all seasons and serves as the visitor's center for the park in the winter.

It was released in 1979 on Columbia. Recording Coe closed out the decade with his ninth album for Columbia. The songs, all Coe originals, sequence into the next, which was becoming a hallmark on his records. It was produced again by the team of Ron Bledsoe and Billy Sherrill. Thom Jurek of AllMusic contends, ‚ÄúWith Bledsoe's gritty, in-your-face, performance-based approach and Sherrill's polish and sense of space and texture, they were able to balance all of the inherent contradictions in Coe's music, from the gorgeous balladry of ‚ÄòGone,‚Äô ‚ÄòHeads or Tails,‚Äô and the elaborately arranged dark honky tonk of ‚ÄòMerle and Me‚Äô (not Haggard) to the rocking bluegrass stomp of ‚ÄòHoney Don't‚Äô and the boozy Tex-Mex swagger of ‚ÄòLost.‚Äô‚Äù Musically, several of the songs on Compass Point look to the Caribbean, with shuffling back-beats and breezy rhythms, such as on ‚ÄúLoving Her (Will Make You Lose Your Mind)‚Äù and the tongue-twisting closing track. Lyrically, Coe covers some of his favourite themes, such as crime and prison on ‚ÄúThree Time Loser‚Äù and ‚ÄúMerle and Me,‚Äù tunes that echo Coe‚Äôs own youth spent in jail and youth reformatories. ‚ÄúHoney Don‚Äôt‚Äù sounds like Coe striking back at anyone who would dare question his musical credentials (‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a roadie for Satan, honey/I was the sound man for the Devil‚Ä¶‚Äù) and includes the repeated line ‚ÄúHoney don‚Äôt you pull that shit on me,‚Äù a rare expletive on a major label country record at the time. Opener ‚ÄúHeads or Tails‚Äù ruminates on the chance nature of romance, with Coe singing the title in a Johnny Cash drawl.

Following Alexander the Great's brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region known today as Afghanistan. In 305 BCE, they ceded much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush. Their decline began 60 years after Ashoka's rule ended, leading to the Hellenistic reconquest of the region by the Greco-Bactrians. Much of it soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo- Greeks had been defeated and expelled by the Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE. Much of Afghanistan has been influenced by Buddhist, Hindu and Zoroastrian cultures until the arrival of Islam in the 7th century. But despite many Afghans converting to Islam, the Muslims and Hindus lived side by side. Between the 10th century to the mid 18th century, northern India has been invaded by a number of invaders based in what today is Afghanistan. Among them were the Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khaljis, Suris, Mughals and Durranis. During these eras, especially during the Mughal period (1526‚Äì1858), many Afghans began immigrating to India due to political unrest in their regions. Border crossing between British India and Afghanistan in 1934 Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Khan Sahib were prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement and active supporters of the Indian National Congress. Although the NWFP became part of Pakistan in 1947, active Pashtun support for the Indian freedom struggle led to great sympathy in India for the cause of Pashtun autonomy and freedom. The Indian government continued to support Pashtun leader Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan in lobbying for greater Pashtun freedom in the NWFP. Indians are working in various construction projects, as part of India's rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan, although the Indian intelligence agency RAW is accused by countries such as Pakistan of working to malign Pakistan and train & support insurgents. These workers are estimated to be anywhere between 3,000 and 4,000. Indian nationals stationed in Afghanistan have often faced continuous security threats in the country, with kidnappings and many attacks (such as the February 2010 Kabul attack) deliberately carried out on them. In January 1950, a five-year Treaty of Friendship was signed between the two countries in New Delhi. Other than affirming \\"everlasting peace and friendship between the two Governments\\", the treaty provided for establishment of diplomatic and consular posts in each other's territories. India recognized the new Republic of Afghanistan on July 19, 1973. Indian foreign minister Swaran Singh visited Afghan President Mohammed Daoud Khan in October that year, and Khan visited India in March 1975. On July 7, 1974, the two countries signed a trade protocol. Soviet occupation to Taliban regime The Republic of India was the only South Asian nation to recognise the Soviet- backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union's military presence in Afghan territories, and provided humanitarian aid to President Najibullah's Government in Afghanistan. Following the withdrawal of the Soviet armed forces from Afghanistan in 1989, India continued to support Najibullah's government with humanitarian aid. After its fall, India together with the international community supported the coalition government that took control, but relations and contacts ended with the outbreak of another civil war, which brought to power the Taliban, an Islamist militia supported by Pakistan. The Taliban regime was recognized only by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha monuments by the Taliban led to outrage and angry protests by India. Similarly the Taliban's move in 2001 to require Afghan Hindus to wear identification patches, reminiscent of Nazi policies, was heavily criticised by India. In 1999, the hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 landed and stayed in Kandahar in Afghanistan and the Taliban were suspected of supporting them. India became one of the key supporters of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. Since 2001 The new Afghan Parliament building has been built by India. During the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, India offered intelligence and other forms of support for the Coalition forces. After the overthrow of the Taliban, India established diplomatic relations with the newly established democratic government, provided aid and participated in the reconstruction efforts. India has provided $650‚Äì750 million in humanitarian and economic aid, making it the largest regional provider of aid for Afghanistan. India's support and collaboration extends to rebuilding of air links, power plants and investing in health and education sectors as well as helping to train Afghan civil servants, diplomats and police. India also seeks the development of supply lines of electricity, oil and natural gas. Also to give Afghan students scholarships. The Indian Army's Border Roads Organisation constructed a major road in 2009 in the remote Afghan province of Nimroz, connecting Delaram to Zaranj. This has proved a viable alternative route for the duty-free movement of goods through the Chabahar port in Iran to Afghanistan. Key to India's strategy in Afghanistan is to build up transportation links that bypass Pakistan, helping reduce the Afghan economy's dependence on Pakistan. In 2005, India proposed Afghanistan's membership in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Both nations also developed strategic and military cooperation against Islamic militants. Owing to the killing of an Indian national by Taliban militants in November 2005, India deployed 200 soldiers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) to provide security for Indian nationals and the projects supported by India. Afghanistan strengthened its ties with India in wake of persisting tensions and problems with Pakistan, which was suspected of continuing to shelter and support the Taliban. India pursues a policy of close collaboration with countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Iran in order to bolster its standing as a regional power and contain its rival Pakistan, which stands accused of aiding and abetting Islamic militants in Kashmir and other states of India. Three memorandums of understanding (MOUs) for strengthening cooperation in the fields of rural development, education and standardisation between the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Afghan National Standardisation Authority were signed between Afghanistan and India during Hamid Karzai's visit to India in April 2006.India 2008, Pg 494 An agreement providing $50 million to promote bilateral businesses between Afghanistan and India was signed during the visit of the Afghan Foreign Minister Dr. Spanta between 29 June ‚Äì 1 July 2006. During the same year, India raised its aid package to Afghanistan by $150 million, to $750 million. In 2007, Afghanistan finally became the eighth member of SAARC. In July 2008 the Indian embassy in Kabul was attacked by a suicide car bomb ‚Äì the deadliest attack in Kabul since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. The bombing killed 58 people and wounded 141. Senior Indian Army officer Brigadier Ravi Datt Mehta was entering the embassy gates in a car along with V. Venkateswara Rao when the attack took place. Both were killed in the blast. The Afghan government's official position implies that Pakistan's ISI was involved in the attack. This position has found support in recent leaks of classified information by WikiLeaks. During the 15th SAARC summit in Colombo, India pledged another $450 million alongside a further $750 million already pledged for ongoing and forthcoming projects. In August 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai visited New Delhi. This visit further strengthened bilateral relations, and Prime Minister Singh pledged further aid for Afghanistan.Relationship with Neighbors On 18 October 2009, the Indian embassy in Kabul was attacked again by a car bomb, little more than a year after the previous attack. The attack killed at least 17 people. Another attack conducted by the same Pakistan-based terrorist organisation took place at the Arya guest house where Indian doctors were staying, resulting in the death of 18 people. India's pledge to rebuild Afghanistan has reached a total of $2 billion in May 2011 after Manmohan Singh arrived to Kabul for a two-day visit.Pajhwok Afghan News ‚Äì Singh given ceremonial reception, 12 May 2011. In the same year India donated 250,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan as part of humanitarian assistance program. The September 2011 assassination of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani was condemned by India, which stated that, \\"Tragically, the forces of terror and hatred have silenced yet another powerful voice of reason and peace in Afghanistan. We unreservedly condemn this act of great brutality,\\" and reiterated the steadfast support of the people and government of India in Afghanistan's \\"quest for peace and efforts to strengthen the roots of democracy\\".Former Afghanistan President Burhanuddin Rabbani assassinated India promised to stand by the people of Afghanistan as they prepare to assume the responsibility for their governance and security after the withdrawal of international forces in 2014.

The attack will not dilute India's development assistance and its contribution to rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan,\\" India's ambassador to Kabul Amar Sinha said at the time. On 24 December 2015, India donated three Mi-25 attack helicopters (with an option to send one more in future) to Afghanistan as part of the bilateral strategic partnership to counter the Talibans. The next day, 25 December, Indian PM Narendra Modi visited Kabul to open the newly constructed Afghan parliament opposite the ruins of the Darul Aman Palace, which had been built by India for $90 million. Modi said \\"It will stand as an enduring symbol of the ties of emotions and values, of affection and aspirations that bind us in a special relationship\\". President Ghani tweeted \\"Though, India and Afghanistan need no introduction, we are bound by a thousand ties‚Ä¶ We have stood by each other in the best and worst of times\\". On 4 June 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani formally inaugurated the $290-million Salma Dam with a capacity of 42 MW power generation. Water from the dam will also serve irrigation purposes. The dam is expected to help Afghanistan capitalize on opportunities that will open up once the India backed Chabahar project, linking the port in Iran to Central Asia's road and railway networks, is completed. On 15 August 2019, on Indian Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended greetings to Afghanistan who were due to also celebrate Afghan Independence Day, the 100th year, four days later. Modi said: \\"Afghanistan is a good neighbour of India, and I wish the country for celebrating 100 years of independence this year.\\" President Ashraf Ghani also sent congratulations with the comment \\"May our friendship last forever.\\" Economy Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani inaugurating the Salma Dam.India seeks to expand its economic presence in Afghanistan as the international coalition fighting the Taliban withdraws combat forces through 2014. Especially, it wants to improve transport connectivity and economic collaboration with countries in Central and South Asia. India has already invested $10.8 billion in Afghanistan as of 2012. More such projects are likely to come up after Nato's withdrawal. This includes setting up Iron ore mines, a 6 MTPA steel plant (by SAIL‚ÄîSteel Authority of India Limited), an 800 MW power plant, Hydro-electric power projects, transmission lines, roads etc., India helped Afghans in the reconstruction of Salma Dam in the Herat province. Besides producing 42 MW power, this Indo-Afghan friendship dam provides irrigation for 75,000 hectares of farmland in the Chisti Sharif district. India and Iran are set to ink a transit agreement on transporting goods to landlocked Afghanistan. The Indian government is investing more than US$100 million in the expansion of the Chabahar port in southeastern Iran which will serve as a hub for the transportation of transit goods. Besides as a goodwill gesture, India has also constructed a new Parliament complex for the Afghan government at a cost of INR 710 crores ($115 million). This building was inaugurated on 25 December 2015. Since Pakistan refused land access, India & Afghanistan have established two air corridors to facilitate bilateral trade. India Afghanistan Friendship Dam Salma Dam, officially the Afghan-India Friendship Dam, is a hydroelectric and irrigation dam project located on the Hari River in Chishti Sharif District of Herat Province in western Afghanistan. The Afghan cabinet renamed the Salma Dam to the Afghan-India Friendship Dam in a move to strengthen relations between the two countries. The hydroelectric plant produces 42 MW of power in addition to providing irrigation for 75,000 hectares of farmland (stabilising the existing irrigation of 35,000 hectares and development of irrigation facilities to an additional 40,000 hectares of land). The dam was opened on 4 June 2016 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

It is the sequel to the book Thunder Cave, (also published by Hyperion Books). Chapter 1 summary Fourteen-year-old Jake is forced to be left to live at a retirement home in Poughkeepsie, New York while his father, Dr. Robert Lansa, travels to help his friend Bill set up a jaguar preserve. Doc, as everyone calls him, takes longer than expected in Brazil and sets up a plane ride for Jake to visit during his Spring Break. When he arrived in Manaus, Jake met Buzz, the expedition's pilot who is supposed to track jaguars at the preserve. Jake meets Doc but is angry with him for not arriving home, not keeping in touch, and not meeting him at the airport. A couple mornings later, Bill is working on the boat they received, and Buzz, Doc, and Jake are heading outside when the boat explodes. This explosion kills Bill, injured Buzz's leg, and injured Doc's arm. At first, the expedition is called off, but Silver, a skipper who lives in his boat nearby, offers his boat. At first, the expedition declines, but they decide that Jake could be the pilot and they could take the boat up the Amazon. Flanna, the expedition's botanist, goes with Doc to Brasilia to get the exploration permit changed. Meanwhile, Buzz teaches Jake how to fly the Morpho, a small ultralight plane. One night, Jake goes into Silver's boat and while looking at some of Silver's books, he is attacked by a man with a scar on his face and knocked out. Jake keeps this a secret between himself and Silver. When Doc and Flanna return, Doc, Flanna, Silver, and Jake get ready for the trip up the Amazon. Silver is the captain of his boat, named the Tito. Silver secretly knows about the man with the scar and encourages everyone to keep a shotgun nearby on the boat. The boat breaks down and they must stop at a village while Silver finds a mechanic there. This is a miserable shantytown with an Indian camp nearby and a gold mine that has small claims from virtually everyone in the shantytown. Jake sees the man with the scar through binoculars and runs to warn Silver. Soon Jake finds Silver and Doc is worried and finds Jake. Then, Doc learns of a jaguar that comes to the town every night and \\"vandalizes\\" the town. There is a betting pool for whoever gets the weight of it right when it is caught. Doc meets with the Indian, Raul, who helps him tranquilize the jaguar under the conditions that he gets to come on the expedition to see it let go and that it gets weighed. Doc agrees and they successfully capture the jaguar, get it weighed, and quickly leave the village. Raul wins the betting pool and donates the money to his camp before he leaves. The expedition continues until Silver wants to go up a tributary that he said might lead to the center of the preserve. Doc, Flanna, and Jake agreem not knowing that he would try to look for the Lost Mines of Muribeca. They try to turn around but the reverse control malfunctions so they continue up the narrow tributary. They find a beautiful lake at the end of the tributary and set up camp there. For several weeks, Doc and Raul tag animals while Flanna studies the plants. Jake tracks the tagged animals using the Morpho. Meanwhile, Silver takes trips out into the rain forest by himself and looks for the lost mines. Things are going well until Doc and Raul take a week-long trip to the rain forest and Silver disappears. Doc returns without Raul and is extremely sick with malaria. Jake lands from one of his flights and Tyler ( the man with the scar) and Fred, who threatened Jake and Doc at the shantytown are both behind him. Tyler holds an automatic rifle and ties up Flanna and Jake. Since Doc can't move, they leave him in the tent. After Fred disobeys Tyler, Fred is shot. Tyler asks Jake and Flanna about Silver, but they don't have any information. Jake is able to deceive Tyler after Tyler wants to know how the tracking equipment worked in order to track down Silver. Jake gives Tyler the frequency for a jaguar's collar and Tyler sets out. Doc comes and untieds Flanna and Jake, afterwards, Jake flies off to find Silver. He purposely crashes into the canopy and finds Silver nearby. Silver talks with Jake and Silver indicates he found the Lost Mines of Muribeca but that he did not want to steal from the natives. They rescue Raul, captured by the isolated Indian camp and they trap Tyler using the killed jaguar's collar. He falls into a pit and after a brawl with Raul and Jake, Silver has to drop his gun and step back. Jake is ordered to sit down by Silver and is almost killed but Flanna shoots Tyler with a compound bow. The night before they would leave the lake and find another place to set up camp, Woolcott, the one who is willing to fund the preserve, along with Buzz, lands in a very nice floatable private plane. He accepts the preserve and Jake flies back to Poughkeepsie, New York for a few more weeks of high school and a trip with his grandfather, Taw, to Arizona while Flanna and Doc stay to run the preserve.

It is illuminated by the star V1647 Ori.  Overview  \\"Only recently discovered by amateur astronomer Julian W. McNeil II [Jay McNeil], this peculiar looking object is currently classified as a cometary- type reflection nebula. The newborn nebula was found while processing a wide field image of Orion's Messier 78 nebular region which was taken from McNeil's suburban backyard using a 3-inch refractor. Images taken of the area before September 2003 show absolutely no signs of the nebula nor its ruddy illuminating star, which can be seen near the object's southern apex. Preliminary research by Bo Reipurth (Univ. of Hawaii) reveals that the nebula was created when the deeply imbedded fetal star previously catalogued as IRAS 05436-0007 somehow erupted and went into outburst. The young star's sudden increase in brightness consequently resulted in the surrounding cocoon of gas and dust becoming illuminated much like a lighthouse would light up a foggy harbor. To actually capture such an eruption of a pre-main sequence star so early in its evolution is an extremely rare occurrence. Often regarded as FU Orionis or EX Lupii type events, these sudden outbursts represent a very elusive stage through which most stars are thought to pass as they make final adjustments with their surroundings before settling down and becoming stable objects much like our very own Sun.\\" Best of AOP: McNeil's Nebula.

The name stilbene was derived from the Greek word , which means shining. Isomers Stilbene exists as two possible isomers known as (E)-stilbene and (Z)-stilbene. (Z)-Stilbene is sterically hindered and less stable because the steric interactions force the aromatic rings 43¬∞ out-of- plane and prevent conjugation. (Z)-Stilbene has a melting point of , while (E)-stilbene melts around , illustrating that the two compounds are quite different. Uses * Stilbene is used in manufacture of dyes and optical brighteners, and also as a phosphor and a scintillator. * Stilbene is one of the gain mediums used in dye lasers. Properties * Stilbene will typically have the chemistry of a diarylethene, a conjugated alkene. * Stilbene can undergo photoisomerization under the influence of UV light. * Stilbene can undergo stilbene photocyclization, an intramolecular reaction. * (Z)-Stilbene can undergo electrocyclic reactions. Natural Occurrence Many stilbene derivatives (stilbenoids) are present naturally in plants. An example is resveratrol and its cousin, pterostilbene.

M√∂ller grew up in North Frisia after its conquest by Germany in the German‚ÄìDanish War of 1864 and attended German universities (Pulsiano and Treharne 2001:447). He began teaching Germanic philology at the University of Copenhagen in 1883 and continued to do so for over thirty-five years (ib.). Also in 1883, he published Das altenglische Volksepos in der urspr√ºnglichen strophischen Form, 'The Old English Folk Epic in the Original Strophic Form', in which he argued, among other things, that Beowulf had been composed in a fixed meter which was corrupted by later poets (ib.).  Indo-European and Semitic  M√∂ller's magnum opus was the Vergleichendes indogermanisch-semitisches W√∂rterbuch, 'Dictionary of Comparative Indo-European‚ÄìSemitic', published in 1911. Although M√∂ller's association of Semitic and Indo-European reflected a high level of linguistic expertise and was the fruit of many years of labor, it did not receive general acceptance from the linguistic community and is rarely mentioned today. It was, however, accepted as valid by a number of leading linguists of the time, such as Holger Pedersen (1924) and Louis Hjelmslev. According to Hjelmslev (1970:79), \\"a genetic relationship between Indo-European and Hamito-Semitic was demonstrated in detail by the Danish linguist Hermann M√∂ller, using the method of element functions\\". M√∂ller's work was continued by Albert Cuny (1924, 1943, 1946) in France and more recently by the American scholar Saul Levin (1971, 1995, 2002). It was doubtless thanks to M√∂ller's work that Holger Pedersen included Hamito-Semitic in his proposed Nostratic language family, a classification maintained by subsequent Nostraticists (e.g. Vladislav Illich- Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky). The Hamitic family was shown to be invalid by Joseph Greenberg (1950), who consequently rejected the name Hamito-Semitic, replacing it with Afroasiatic, under which Semitic is classed today, along with some but not all of the languages formerly classed as Hamitic. The American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard began his career with work in the tradition of M√∂ller and Cuny, initially comparing Indo-European and Semitic (1975). He subsequently broadened the base to include Afroasiatic in general, an approach found in his first major work, Toward Proto-Nostratic: A New Approach to the Comparison of Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Afroasiatic (1984). He later expanded his comparisons to include other language families, such as Uralic and Kartvelian (cf. Bomhard 2008:6). In carrying out his Indo- European‚ÄìSemitic comparison, M√∂ller produced a reconstruction of Proto-Semitic of hitherto unparalleled sophistication. According to Edgar Sturtevant (1908:50): :The theory that Indo-European and Semitic sprang from a common origin has often been suggested and rejected. The first scholar equipped with exact knowledge of both fields to undertake its defence is H. M√∂ller in his book Semitisch und Indogermanisch, I Konsonanten (Kopenhagen and Leipzig, 1906). His argument rests necessarily upon a series of phonetic laws which describe the variations of the two main branches from the assumed parent language. On the Indo-European side M√∂ller starts with the hypothetical forms that all Indo-European scholars use (though with varying views as to their value). For the other term of the comparison, however, he has to construct for himself a prehistoric Semitic. Some reviewers see in this preliminary task the chief value of the book.  The laryngeal theory  M√∂ller is also well known for his contributions to the laryngeal theory. In 1878, Ferdinand de Saussure, then a 21-year-old student at the University of Leipzig, published his M√©moire sur le syst√®me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ√©ennes, 'Dissertation on the original system of vowels in the Indo-European languages', the work that founded the laryngeal theory. According to Saussure, Indo-European had had two \\"sonantic coefficients\\", vanished sounds that had two properties: they lengthened a preceding vowel; one of them gave the vowel e or a timbre, while the other gave the vowel o timbre. Saussure's argument was not accepted by any of the Neogrammarians, the school, primarily based at the University of Leipzig, then reigning at the cutting-edge of Indo-European linguistics. Several of them attacked the M√©moire savagely. Osthoff's criticism was particularly virulent, often descending into personal invective (De Mauro in Saussure 1972:327-328). One of the few scholars to come to Saussure's defense was M√∂ller, beginning in an article in 1880 ‚Äì a defense which earned him Osthoff's scorn as well (ib. 328). M√∂ller offered several refinements over Saussure's original version of the theory: * He argued that a third coefficient was needed: one that produced o timbre, another e timbre, a third a timbre (1880). This view was adopted by most scholars who subsequently endorsed the laryngeal theory.Szemer√©nyi 1996:123-124. * He argued that the coefficients changed not only a preceding but also a following vowel to these timbres.Szemer√©nyi 1996:123 This argument has also been widely accepted. * In 1917, M√∂ller published a major work on the theory, Die semitisch- vorindogermanischen laryngalen Konsonanten, 'The Semitic‚ÄìPre-Indo-European Laryngeal Consonants'. In this work, he argued that the vanished sounds were laryngeals, a type of sound also found in Semitic languages. He also argued that the presence of laryngeals in both Semitic and Indo-European constituted a proof of these families' relationship. As a result of M√∂ller's thesis, the theory originated by Saussure came to be known as \\"the laryngeal theory\\" and the vanished sounds it posits as \\"the laryngeals\\". Today, relatively few scholars believe these sounds were actually laryngeals (indeed there is no consensus on their phonetic value or even whether this is knowable), but the term remains in general use.Zgusta 2006: 2463. For the first half-century of its existence, the laryngeal theory was widely seen as \\"an eccentric fancy of outsiders\\". \\"In Germany it was totally rejected\\" (ib. 134). In 1927, the Polish linguist Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz announced that Hittite ·∏´ was found in two of the positions predicted for a \\"laryngeal\\" by the Saussure‚ÄìM√∂ller theory. The evidence was crushing, overwhelming. As a result, the laryngeal theory is generally accepted today in one form or another, although scholars who deal with the theory disagree on the number of laryngeals to be accepted, with most positing three (like M√∂ller) or four, but some positing as few as oneproposed in Oswald Szemer√©nyi, Einf√ºhrung in die vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1970). or as many as thirteenproposed in Andr√© Martinet, ‚ÄúPhonologie et ‚Äòlaryngales‚Äô‚Äù, Phonetica 1 (1956): 7‚Äì30.. In Oswald Szemer√©nyi's appreciation (1996:124), although \\"Saussure is the founder of modern views on the IE vowel system\\", \\"the true founder of the laryngeal theory is the Danish scholar M√∂ller.\\"  Notes   Works cited  *Bomhard, Allan R. 1975. \\"An outline of the historical phonology of Indo-European.\\" Orbis 24.2:354-390. *Bomhard, Allan R. 1984.

Biography Origins and childhood Born on 3 June 1950 in Lercara Friddi in Sicily, in a very modest Italian family, he is the second child of Antonina (Nina) Salemi and Giuseppe (Peppino) Barracato. His mother was a seamstress in Lercara and his father was initially a miner in a sulphur mine in Lercara. He emigrated to Belgium in the coal basin of Li√®ge, where he signed a three-year contract as a miner.Term of the contract that entitled him to bring his family. In 1951, Nina and her two sons joined Giuseppe in Tilleur Tilleur is 8 km from Li√®ge. in a Red Cross Convoy. Francesco Barracato grew up in a family of eight children. Peppino used to sing Neapolitan songs and opera arias for pleasure and accompanied himself on the guitar. Young Francesco was only 10 when he sang O Sole Mio for the first time in public in a caf√© frequented mostly by Sicilians in Tilleur, \\"Le Passage √† Niveau\\" [The Level Crossing]. Early days In 1963, he turned semi-professional as a singer- guitarist in a group called \\"Les Eperviers\\" [The Sparrow hawks]. He left the technical college in 1965 for the Li√®ge conservatoire to study violin, where he took courses particularly in diction, declamation and voice. In 1966, he joined a new group called \\"Les Tigres Sauvages\\" [Wild Tigers] and won the \\"Microsillon d'Argent\\" [Silver Microgroove Record] at the Festival of Ch√¢telet in Belgium ‚Äì a prize that included the recording of a single. He recorded two titles: ‚ÄúPetite fille‚Äù [Little Girl] and \\"‚ÄùNe pleure pas\\" [Don't cry], under the pseudonym of Fran√ßois Bara. His father bought the 500 records that were pressed and managed to sell them for jukeboxes. The winner also got to perform as a warm-up act for three confirmed artists: Johnny Hallyday, Pascal Danel and Michel Polnareff, his idol. In 1969, his meeting with the Belgian producer Constant Defourny led to his first contract with a record company: Barclay- Belgique. He recorded ‚ÄúSylvie‚Äù in July 1969, and released his first single under the name of Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois, in homage to the composer Chopin, whose real first name was Fr√©d√©ric-Fran√ßois. He gave his first performances as a solo artist in venues in the Li√®ge region during the tour of The Best Group orchestra: he performed five of his own compositions, including Sylvie, of course.Sylvie is the first name of the lyricist‚Äôs daughter. He released a new single, ‚ÄúLes Orgues de Saint Michel‚Äù [The Organ of Saint Michael], which was not at all successful, then another one, \\"Marian,\\" accompanied by a second title \\"Comme tous les amoureux,\\" [Like all people in love], which was written especially to represent Belgium at the Eurovision contest in 1970, but was not selected. 1970s In 1970, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois recorded a new title \\"Jean\\",Jean is pronounced as in English. an adaptation of the song in the British film The Prime of Miss Jean BrodieThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Ronald Neame (1969). Distributed on the AZ label, this song crossed the Franco-Belgian border, thanks to Lucien Morisse, the programming director of Europe 1, who played it on his channel and enabled the young singer to have a number one single on the hit parade for the first time, though it was not enough to make him famous. He subsequently released two singles \\"Le pays d'o√π tu viens\\" [The Country you come from] and \\"Shabala\\": the first was broadcast on the Formule J programme of the Belgian radio corporation, the RTB. The fan base begins to grow. In 1970, he married Monique Vercauteren, a miner's daughter, whom he had met a year earlier. He recorded a new song, this time spoken and not sung, \\"I love you je t'aime\\" as a duet with Monique. Their first child, Gloria, was born on 13 February 1971. \\"I love you, je t'aime\\" was played over and over on the Dutch pirate station Veronica, which broadcast from a boat anchored outside territorial waters. The 30,000 sold copies of this record are to be considered as the first real recognition on the part of the public. But Monique continued to work at the factory; Fr√©d√©ric was not earning much from his music and experienced a certain discouragement when he composed \\"Comme on jette une bouteille √† la mer\\" [Like a bottle thrown in the sea] and \\"Je n'ai jamais aim√© comme je t'aime\\" [I have never loved the way I love you], with lyrics by Marino Atria.Sicilian by his mother, Neapolitan by his father and a miner's son himself. Having stayed at the no. 1 spot of the Formule J hit parade for thirteen weeks, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois emerged from anonymity, which made his new label, Vogue-Belgique, decide to distribute \\"Je n'ai jamais aim√© comme je t'aime,\\" prudently only in French record shops in Pas-de-Calais, a region next to Belgium: 250,000 copies were sold. He considers this sixth single, recorded under the name of Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois, as his first real hit. His second child, Vincent, was born a few months later, on 15 May 1972. The real hit was to come in the summer of that year: ‚ÄúJe voudrais dormir pr√®s de toi‚Äù [I would like to sleep near you], which sold 500,000 copies and went to number one in several countries. As hit followed hit, (\\"Laisse-moi vivre ma vie\\" [Let me live my life] (end of 1972‚Äì one million records sold), \\"Viens te perdre dans mes bras\\" [Come and lose yourself in my arms] (1973), \\"Chicago\\" (1975), tour would follow tour. That is when his second son and third child, Anthony, was born, on 8 January 1976. Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois is classified among the \\"romantic crooners for young girls\\",The term \\"romantic crooners for young girls\\" was not pejorative at the time. (like Patrick Juvet, Christian Delagrange, Dave, Mike Brant). He could capitalise on his success until 1979, when the arrival of disco would dislodge him from the top of the pops. 1980s The crossing of the wilderness would last three years, until 1982. This low ebb took its toll with psychosomatic effects: he suffered serious attacks of spasmophilia which would become less frequent only when he started having hits again, thanks to free radios, which had just made their appearance, and played the title ‚ÄúAdios Amor‚Äù [Goodbye love] at every turn ‚Äì an adaptation by the lyricist Michel Jourdan of a Germany song by Andy Borg. 500,000 copies the single sold in a few weeks, followed by \\"Aimer\\" [Love] (adaptation M.Jourdan/Andy Borg) in 1983. This return to grace enabled him to go on tour again, which would take him to Haiti where he sang for the first time in that country. In 1984, he signed with Trema, the record company of Michel Sardou and Enrico Macias. Up until then, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois had sold mainly singles, in spite of thirteen LPs at Vogue. He released a new album \\"Mon c≈ìur te dit je t'aime\\" [My heart tells you that I love you], which went three times gold. The creation of the Top 50 that same year would prove a decisive turning point in his career, since for the first time in recording history, singers were ranked according to their actual sales and not on subjective criteria. And yet, showbiz circles in Paris were still reticent. He was 34 years old when he performed at the Olympia for the first time, thanks to his impresario, Mo√Øse Benitah, who managed to convince Jean-Michel Boris and Paulette Coquatrix. The show was sold out. And the craze for his new song \\"Je t'aime √† l'italienne\\" [I love you, Italian style] was such that his name would be in lights once again the following year (1985) on the great music hall on the right bank, while his first book Les yeux charbon [Coal Eyes] (Carr√®re-Lafon) was a homage to his family and his public. On 14 April 1987, his father Peppino Barracato died. The success of his new album \\"Une nuit ne suffit pas\\" [One night is not enough] (first joint effort with a female lyricist, Michaele) and the preparation of his third Olympia show in 1988, helped him to overcome this shock. In 1989, he sang in twenty-five cities in Canada, as well as in the United States (April 1989) in Miami and in New York, where he gave five performances in three different venues: Brooklyn College and Queen's College at the CUNY, and the Town Hall Foundation. 1990s For three weeks, from 1 to 18 March 1990, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois performed at the Olympia. The first evening, as he went off stage, he was told that his fourth child, Victoria, had been born while he was performing the last song of his show, \\"Je t'aime √† l'italienne.\\" Two years later, he would perform on that fabled stage for an entire month ‚Äì the longest run in his career. In 1993, he left Trema to create his own production company, MBM, in order to gain complete creative freedom, and signed a contract with BMG for the distribution. He released the last vinyl single of his career, \\"L'amour c'est la musique\\" [Life is music]. Then came his first CD entitled \\"Tzigane\\" [Gypsy] (as well as a first excerpt from the same single title in Belgium). On 20 December 1996, he was received in a private audience by Pope John Paul II in Rome, with other distinguished guests.Dionne Warwick, Nathalie Cole, Laura Pausini and Los del Rio Note 8. On that occasion, he sang for the first time in his life before the Pope, accompanied by 70 musicians and the choruses of the Rome opera. His mother, whom he always admired, died on 17 August 1997. Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois dedicated to her his eighth appearance at the Olympia in March 1998, followed by a tour that attracted more than 300,000 spectators. He knew that he was going to sing for the first time in his life in his native village of Lercara Friddi in Sicily on 30 May 1999. A few months before that event, he recorded an album with Italian classics (\\"Volare\\", \\"Come Prima\\", \\"Ciao Ciao Bambina\\") entitled \\"Les plus grandes m√©lodies italiennes\\" [The Greatest Italian Melodies]. He also introduced a family song known to many Sicilians \\"La porta abanidduzza\\" [The door ajar], and for the first time in his career, he sang in the Sicilian language. He considered it as a return to his roots and a way to celebrate thirty years of success. In 1999, the Editions LCJ Productions released a VHS of the film \\"Les d√©dales d'Icare\\" [The maze of Icarus] Armand Rocour (1981 Belgium); the song of the film Je voyage [I am travelling], was performed by Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois who was playing his first role in a film. 2000s Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois entered the 21st century by publishing his second book, Ma vie [My life] (Editions Hors Collection) with the journalist Serge Igor, where he talks about his life as never before, and opens his personal photo archives for the first time. His tour in 2002‚Äì2003 featured more than 100 consecutive performances in France, Belgium and Switzerland. He decided to pay homage to Tino Rossi by covering his biggest hits in 2003: M√©diterran√©e, Marinella, Ave Maria, Petit Papa No√´l. In 2004, during his eleventh appearance at the Olympia, he sang in English for the first time in his career, Elvis Presley's song, \\"Love Me Tender\\", to a standing ovation. In 2005, after three years without any recordings, he released a CD with 15 songs, including \\"Et si on parlait d'amour\\" [And if we spoke of love]. It sold 200,000 copies in a few weeks. In October 2005, he published his third book, \\"Autobiographie d'un Sicilien\\" [Autobiography of a Sicilian] (Editions Ramsay), where he presents his values and ideals. That year, some of his lady admirers would give him another nickname than the famous \\"Fr√©do,\\" by calling him \\"La voix de l'amour\\" [The voice of love]. Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois likes to share snippets of his private life. That is why the album released on 14 June 2006, entitled \\"Mes Pr√©f√©rences\\" is emblematic, because it marks out the highlights of his career and family life: a song sung for the first time in public at the age of ten (‚ÄúO Sole Mio‚Äù); his first recording (Petite fille); his first big hit (‚ÄúLaisse-moi vivre ma vie‚Äù); the song written in honour of his mother while she was alive ‚ÄúMamina‚Äù (‚ÄúMy little mamma‚Äù in Sicilian); the tender declaration for his latest little child, Victoria \\"Fou d'elle\\" [Mad about her]; the title which he composed for the sixth anniversary of his father's death, \\"Le Strapontin de papa\\" [Dad's folding chair]. Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois said \\"Merci la vie!\\" [Thank you life] twice in a year's time: The first time on 22 October 2007, with his CD entitled, literally, ‚ÄúMerci la vie!‚Äù [Thank you life], and the second time on 22 October 2008 with the publication of the book with photos devoted to him, with more than 300 shots by Patrick Carpentier, \\"Merci la vie !\\" (Editions Du Rocher). Nevertheless, he fell ill on 26 October 2008 a little before his concert at the Forum of Li√®ge, overcome by an excessive dose of cortisone. He was hospitalised twice at the Li√®ge Academic Medical Center. He stayed there for nearly a month the first time, from 28 November to 22 December 2008, and fifteen days the second time in February 2009. Whilst on his hospital bed, the live album then the DVD version of the Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois tour from the Olympia to Forest National were released, which mixed recordings of his performances on stage in Paris and in Brussels. The doctors recommended complete rest. He put his career on hold for a year. He would sing again in public, exceptionally, during the T√©l√©vie programme on the Belgian RTL-TVI channel for cancer research. He is seen performing Frank Sinatra's Something' Stupid with his daughter Victoria, a duet created together in March 2008 on the Olympia stage on his daughter's eighteenth birthday.

After that show, Michel Drucker said that he had attracted the season's biggest audience thanks to Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois. The \\"Amor Latino\\" album was a new development in the \\"Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois\\" style: a real ‚Äúmusical blend‚Äù came into being, with the creation of new musical styles: classic-pop, rock- tango, r&b; ‚Äì tango, electro-swing, etc. He celebrated his 14th run at the Olympia from 28 February to 9 March 2014, then went on tour until 2015.

‚Äì Olympia 2014 (Pr√©vue pour le 27 Avril 2915) Audiovisual It was in the summer of 1969 that people heard Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois sing on the radio for the first time: on the Belgian station RTBF. He performed \\"Sylvie.\\" He was a guest on his first radio show a few weeks later on that same station. In France, in 1970, it was Europe 1 that broadcast a song by Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois for the first time, \\"Jean,\\" which put him in the charts (of that station) for the first time. In the second half of 1971, \\"Je n'ai jamais aim√© comme je t'aime\\" was played for the first time on the \\"Formule J\\" programme of the RTBF. This song stayed at number one for thirteen weeks. The French in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, who listen often to radio stations transmitting from Belgium, could not find this single at their record shops, because it was not distributed in France, and crossed the border to buy it in Belgian record shops. He participated in his first radio show in France in 1972 on Europe N¬∞1, in \\"5, 6, 7\\" presented by Jacques Our√©vitch, at the time that \\"Je voudrais dormir pr√®s de toi\\" came out. Michel Jonasz and Michel Berger were in the same studio, as they were embarking on their careers. His first television show was broadcast in 1972, on the sole French station at the time, the ORTF. Presented by Guy Lux, it was transmitted live from the little white wine feast in Nogent-sur-Marne (Val-de-Marne). He was roosted on a float in the company of Mike Brant, and both of them were driven through all the streets of the city! That same year, he took part in his second television show: ‚ÄúMidi-Premi√®re‚Äù presented by Dani√®le Gilbert and Jacques Martin. He met there his fellow Italian/Sicilian/Belgian countryman, Salvatore Adamo, who was already a big star. It was the start of an enduring lifelong friendship. In 1973, the presenter Christian Morin on Europe N¬∞1 was the first to use the diminutive \\"Fr√©do\\" to refer to him, during a programme called \\"Le hit parade\\" where he was invited to reward the millionth buyer of his single \\"Laisse-moi vivre ma vie.\\" In December 1974, he sang live on RTL. He was not in the major studio, but in the Church of Chesnay in the Yvelines, before two hundred children and their parents. The proceeds went to the handicapped children of Garches (Hauts-de-Seine) and to fatherless children of the \\"Le Nid de la ville d'Antony\\" [The Nest of Anthony's City] foundation. In the beginning of 1975, in the programme entitled \\"Samedi est √† vous\\" [Saturday over to you] presented by Bernard Golay on the first station of the ORTF, he was tied, with Mike Brant, for first place, as the favourite singer of television viewers. From 1975 to 1979, he appeared on \\"Ring-parade\\" on Antenne 2, presented by Guy Lux and Jean-Pierre Foucault. Radio has been decisive in Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois's career, because it was thanks to free radio stations that he tasted success, when they had just come into being, by playing \\"Adios Amor\\" extensively in 1982, which brought him out of three long years in the wilderness. From 1983 to 1998, he was invited many times to the Jacques Martin's \\"√âcole des Fans\\" [School of Fans] as part of the programme \\"Dimanche Martin\\" [Sunday Martin]. As of 1984, Pascal Sevran invited him regularly to appear in \\"La Chance aux Chansons\\" [Give songs a chance]. In 1995, he was the main guest of the show for an entire week, when his second album, \\"Les Italos-Am√©ricains\\" [Italian Americans] was released. In 1988, he was on hand for the launch of a brand new show of the Belgian station RTL-TVI, \\"T√©l√©vie\\" [Telelife], which raised funds for leukaemia. He would make it a point of honour to participate every year down to the present day. In France, during a broadcast of Jean-Pierre Foucault's \\"Sacr√©e Soir√©e\\" [Hell of an evening] in 1988, his son Anthony surprised him by singing Chicago, accompanied by his sister Gloria (on guitar) and his brother Vincent (on piano). On 17 December 1988, Patrick Sabatier devoted a broadcast of \\"Avis de Recherche\\" [Wanted] on TF1. He and his seven brothers and sisters are united for the first time in a television studio. His wife, Monique, has sung only once in public, during a \\"Sacr√©e Soir√©e\\" show for Valentine's Day, on 14 February 1991, when she joined him in a rendition of \\"Mon c≈ìur te dit je t'aime.‚Äù On 12 April 1991, \\"Tous √† la Une\\" [All in the headlines] asked him to be its exceptional editor in chief on TF1. Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand devoted his \\"C'est notre vie\\" [It's our life] show on 17 June 1994, during which he met the actress who made him dream in his youth, Gina Lollobrigida. He improvised \\"Le Chaland\\" [The Barge] on the guitar, in Italian, because he knew it was one of her favourite songs, which served as a leitmotiv for several cult films in Italy. In 1999, RTL-TVI and Maryl√®ne Bergmann devoted to him a special show recorded live at the Cirque Royal [Royal Circus] in Brussels. On 25 April 2009, he sponsored a new programme on the Belgian station RTL-TVI entitled \\"Au c≈ìur de T√©l√©vie\\" [At the heart of Telelife] to get people to understand the scourge that is cancer through reports and interviews. On the same day, he was on stage at the same station, as every year, for \\"T√©l√©vie\\" for research on all forms of cancer. It was during this evening that he sang for the first time again, after having ceased all activities for six months. In France, although he had not appeared in public since his concert on 17 October 2008 at Micropolis in Besan√ßon, he wanted television viewers to see that he was doing well by making a surprise appearance on 14 May 2009 in Sophie Davant's show \\"C'est au programme\\" [It's on the programme] on France 2. On the radio, he broke his silence only once, at the request of Dave, who presented a revamped version of Top 50 the entire summer on Europe 1. The footage was broadcast on 17 August 2009. In 2010, during Daniela Lumbroso's \\"Chabada\\" show, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois was surrounded by Salvatore Adamo and the tenor Roberto Alagna. None of the three singers stuck to the initial programme (they were to pay homage to Polnareff, Brassens and Luis Mariano respectively), and together, they created a \\"Sicilian\\" ambiance on stage, bringing their childhood memories musically back to life. In 2011, during a special \\"Vivement Dimanche\\" [Ever on Sunday] show devoted to Italy, Michel Drucker invited Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois, who joined Ornella Muti, Arturo Brachetti and \\"Les Pr√™tres\\" [The Priests] on stage. That same year, St√©phane Pauwels launched a new show on the Belgian RTL-TVI station: \\"Les orages de la vie\\" [The storms of life], the aim of which is to show that even the biggest stars have gone through stormy patches. He asked Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois to be the first \\"subject\\" of his show, and took him back to Tilleur, the neighbourhood of his youth, in the house where his parents used to live when his first producer, Constant Defourny, came knocking on their door. During the 2010s, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois was a regular guest on many shows such as Patrick S√©bastien's \\"Les Ann√©es Bonheur\\" [Years of happiness], Humbert Ibach's \\"Les Grands du Rire\\" [The great comedians], presented by Yves Lecoq, or \\"Face √† Face\\" [Face to Face] on RTL-TVI. In the beginning of 2014, Fr√©d√©ric was invited to Sophie Davant's \\"C'est au programme,\\" during the course of which the writer Marc L√©vy paid him a stirring tribute, as if he had written the exceptional destiny of little Francesco Barracato. Fr√©d√©ric was very moved, to the point of wishing to include this video in his new tour, in a segment entitled \\"Hommage √† mon p√®re\\" [Homage to my father].
