The work is based on the Winnie Winkle series, but Lichtenstein changed both the graphical description and the narrative accompaniment that he presents in a speech balloon. As with most of his early romance comics works, this consisted of \\"a boy and a girl connected by romantic dialogue and action\\". Details The source for Engagement Ring was the July 16, 1961 Winnie Winkle by Martin Branner The original source was a Martin Branner panel from the July 16, 1961 Winnie Winkle published in the Chicago Tribune. Measuring 172.1 cm √ó 201.9 cm (67 3/4 in √ó 79 1/2 in), Engagement Ring's \\"patchy\\" screen of small flesh coloring Ben-Day dots and \\"staccato\\" drawing are considered tentative. The general \\"rawness\\" of the work links it to Lichtenstein's work from the 1950s, while its \\"integrated formality\\" links it to his subsequent works. Lichtenstein used only a few basic colors, with the same red being used for the fingernails, lips, drapes, and wall, while the same yellow provided the color for the hair and the lampshade. Although the painting is considered \\"a fully characteristic painting, conceptually and manually\\", it is not as poised a composition as his subsequent works. The style of the painting is described as \\"dry\\" and with \\"the color compression and linear simplification of the comics are dilated to the scale of easel painting\\". Using a single frame of a comic book source draws the reader in without providing closure with a clear expected outcome and without explaining the circumstances. When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at The Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Engagement Ring was one of the works in the show (along with works such as Look Mickey, Blam and The Refrigerator) and it sold for $1200 ($ in dollars). The show ran from February 10 through March 3. In 1962, Lichtenstein produced several paintings about engagement rings and wedding bands.

It is considered to fall within the art movement known as Pop art. It depicts \\"a single sphere with patterned, variously directional semi-circular grooves.\\" The work is commonly associated with black-and-white Piet Mondrian works. It is one of the works that was presented at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and one that was critical to his early association with pop art. The work is commonly critiqued for its tension involving a three-dimensional representation in two dimensions with much discussion revolving around the choice of a background nearly without any perspective. History When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball was one of the works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein included Golf Ball in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context. Golf Ball is said to reflect the black and white elements of Compositions in Black and White, 1917, Piet Mondrian. The use of black and white is regarded as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition in Black and White. Alternatively, it may have been a reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-World War I black and white oval paintings, such as Pier and ocean, 1915. For someone familiar with modern art, the formally related oval paintings of Piet Mondrian from before the First World War (Ill. p. 26) may come to mind. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. \\"Lichtenstein's dramatic use of black and white is also a feature of subsequent paintings such as Golf Ball, 1962 ... Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings. Description In 1962, Lichtenstein produced several works in which he depicted \\"...the repetitive regularity of their patterned surfaces...\\" Golf Ball is a depiction of a golf ball using a Mondrianesque set of black and white arcs to depict the three-dimensionality of the subject. However, the neutral background manipulates the image and diminishes the volumetric characteristics by stripping the viewer of his perspective. It is described as a \\"pure graphic mark on a gray ground\\" as well as a \\"totality of abstract marks.\\" Lichtenstein described Golf Ball as \\"the antithesis of what was thought of as having 'art meaning'\\" because of its lack of perspective. Golf Ball is an example of the emerging \\"confident authority\\" of his single- image paintings with its \\"Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness\\". The \\"frontal and centralized presentation\\"'s directness lacked the sophistication to market the images of household goods for advertising but was considered daring artistically. The black and white painting on a grey background challenges both the natural perception of realism and the boundaries of abstraction. The work \\"gives us both the impression of space and the fact of surface\\". Golf Ball was one of the bases by which \\"critics aligned him with other practitioners of Pop Art\\", although much is made about the painting's references to abstract painting, especially its likeness to Mondrian's works. Furthermore, the painting leverages tensions regarding three-dimensional representation in two dimensions resulting from spatial ambiguities caused by the lack of cues in the background. Reception Diane Waldman refers to the subject of Golf Ball as a freestanding form. This is one of the figures in which Lichtenstein demonstrates his draftsman experience. \\"Lichtenstein's experience as a draftsman is reflected in his spare presentation of kitchen stoves, washing machines, bathroom interiors, golf balls, ice cream sodas.... This work demonstrated his maturation as an artist with standardized contours that present uniformity and solidified inflections. This is a strong example of presenting the tension of volumetric potential balanced against two- dimensional presentation. \\"Both Black Flowers and Golf Ball are successful examples of this dialectic. It also shows how placement against a neutral background diminishes three-dimensionality. Despite Lichtenstein's techniques to display/minimize dimensionality, the viewer imposes his or her own visualization experiences on the painting, which minimizes the effect of spatial illusion. \\"We know that a golf ball is three-dimensional, and so most of us project the additional dimension onto such a two-dimensional image even though it may not be depicted in that manner.\\" See also * 1962 in art Notes References * * External links *Golf Ball at the Lichtenstein Foundation website Category:1962 paintings Category:Paintings by Roy Lichtenstein Category:Sports paintings Category:Still life paintings Category:Golf culture ","title":"Golf Ball"},{"id":"35823789","text":"M-Maybe is a 1965 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein. It is one of his romance comics-based works. History Lichtenstein's first solo show at The Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962 sold out before opening. Engagement Ring sold for $1200 and Blam sold for $1000. Prices for his work rose quickly. In 1965, German collector Peter Ludwig asked Castelli, what price Lichtenstein might accept to sell M-Maybe from his personal collection. By then, the going rate for a Lichtenstein was $6000 and Castelli estimated $12,000. Ludwig offered Lichtenstein $30,000 to purchase the work. Details M-Maybe depicts an blonde attractive girl, which is typical of Lichtenstein's romance comics adaptations. As is a common theme among these works, she awaits a man in a vague but urban setting. The thought bubble reads \\"M‚ÄìMaybe he became ill and couldn‚Äôt leave the studio\\". The text and her expression jointly capture her continuing worry and anticipation. David Britt likens the work to Victorian narrative painting because Lichtenstein invites much speculation with the work, including the identities of the present and absent subjects of the work as well as the \\"nature of the situation\\". I.e, what might be holding up his arrival. Eckhard Schneider describes this single-frame style of art as stills suddenly halting a narrative associated with young women's predicaments, noting that \\"The private tone of the words increases the paintings‚Äô aura of authenticity, like verbal snap-snots ‚Äì an aspect especially apparent in the hesitantly voiced ‚ÄòM-Maybe‚Äô.\\" However, Lichtenstein idealizes the appearance with graphic tension that separates the emotional subject matter from the apparent poise of the depiction. Lichtenstein had a desire that his paintings look as mechanical as possible although he was a painter. Rather than selecting subject matter from photographs by an individual, he selected teen and action comics, such as the obvious source for this work, as subjects since they were illustrated by teams that produced source material that was devoid of \\"personal elements of style\\". After 1963, Lichtenstein's comics-based women \\"look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup.\\" This particular example is one of several that is cropped so closely that the girl's hair flows beyond the edges of the canvas. This is an example of Lichtenstein humorously presenting a subject that might be crowded out in a newspaper with a sort of ironic self-awareness that relies on the difference between art and the rest of the world.

(sometimes I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It! or simply I Can See the Whole Room!) is a 1961 painting by Roy Lichtenstein. It is a painting of a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting. The work is based on a William Overgard-drawn comics panel from a Steve Roper cartoon. Lichtenstein's derivation augments the presentation of the narrative and expands the use of color in the image. As with the original the image employs the theme of vision, and focuses specifically on mechanized vision as well as monocularity. Description of the artwork The source of I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! is August 6, 1961 Steve Roper cartoon Based on a 1961 William Overgard drawing for a Steve Roper cartoon story published by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein‚Äôs I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking through a hole in a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon. The picture teases the viewer who is given the feeling that they are in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the painting who is a man that peeks through a hole in the door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption \\"I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It\\", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic. The speech bubble makes the entire canvas relevant by broadening the attention to the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, there is reason to describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self- reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin. The work is an example of Lichtenstein's presentation of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It is considered to be a work on the subject of \\"focal vision and blindness\\", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as \\"the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze\\", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology. Ownership of the artwork, and at auction The painting was purchased by art and design director / collector Emily Hall Tremaine and her husband in 1961 for $550. From 1961-87, Tremaine lent the artwork to many exhibitions, and she extensively facilitated reproduction of the artwork in various media. Several photos of the artwork were taken over the years as installed in a glass barn on the Tremaine farmhouse property in Madison, CT. A photograph of an installation view, featuring I can see the whole room‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs nobody in it!, was taken as part of Louise Lawler's Tremaine pictures series in 1984.

Chesnutt which was edited by Matthew Wilson and Marjan Van Schaik.Chesnutt, Charles W. Evelyn's Husband. University Press of Mississippi, 2005, p. 4. In addition to being an author, Chesnutt was an educator, lawyer and political activist who was involved in the early works of the NAACP. Few details about writing of the work are known, other than a rejection letter from McClure Phillips in 1903. The book portrays a love triangle of white high-society in early 19th century Boston. His writing straddles both the local color and literary realism schools of genre in American writing. Plot overview Evelyn's Husband is the African American author Charles W. Chesnutt's attempt at portraying white life in Boston in the early 1900s. The book examines the role of fate on the lives of two men, one older and one younger, in their pursuit of the same woman. Plot summary The novel Evelyn's Husband revolves around four major characters, placing them in extraordinary situations under the power of coincidental fate in order to examine human nature, morality, and love. The primary plot involves Edward Cushing‚Äîan older, rich gentleman who acted as Evelyn's guardian for much of her life‚Äîand Hugh Manson‚Äîa young newly successful architect‚Äîwho compete for the love of Evelyn Thayer. Her widow mother, Alice Thayer, has a romantic interest in Cushing, the friend of her deceased husband who has acted as a guardian and benefactor of the Thayer family. Despite this romantic interest, Alice feels compelled to repay Cushing for his kindness towards the Thayer family. This book starts in the Thayer household, where Edward Cushing waits to take Alice and Evelyn to an opera. The background details of Mr. Thayer's death and Cushing's presence in the Thayer's life are explained, as well as the proposed marriage of Evelyn to Cushing. After Mr. Thayer's death, Alice had a romantic interest in Cushing, but now regards these feelings as those of friendship. Cushing, business partners and friends with Mr. Thayer, gained a huge respect for the Thayer family and helped them economically after Mr. Thayer's death. He regards Alice as a great friend bound to her husband's memory. Alice now greatly desires her daughter, Evelyn, to marry Cushing in order to repay the family's debt to Cushing. At the opera, Evelyn becomes the center of attention for many young men, including Hugh Manson and William Rice. These men approach Evelyn and her mother when Cushing leaves to use the telephone. Manson cannot take his eyes off Evelyn, and invites the ladies to his office to review plans for Rice's new house. Evelyn finds Manson attractive and bold, and questions if she feels love for Cushing. Regarding him as a guardian her entire life, Evelyn contemplates whether she loves him at all. The next day, Cushing travels to New York. Alice's son, Wentworth, went to college and began drinking and using drugs. He also ran away with a woman, leaving little contact with his family. Cushing goes to New York to help Wentworth, who is now ill. While he is away, Evelyn and Alice go to an art gallery that Manson talked about at the opera. Manson spends the entire day periodically checking the art gallery, and subsequently runs into the two women. They all spend the day together, and learn of an upcoming party thrown by Mrs. Archer. The following day Evelyn goes to an art museum alone, where she again runs into Manson. He reveals his past, telling her of his poor upbringing in Kentucky. After their time together, Manson reveals his love for Evelyn. She informs him of her engagement, to which he remarks that she is not bound to Cushing until marriage. Cushing, tied up with Wentworth in New York, cannot make Mrs. Archer's party. He sends gifts to the women, and Evelyn feels dread and regret towards her engagement with him. Questioning the power of love, she remarks that she feels like a prisoner in her engagement. At the party, many men ask Evelyn to dance, and her beauty bewilders the men. Manson and Evelyn share many dances and explore the grand house together. Alice becomes concerned about their disappearance and searches the house for them. Outside, she finds Evelyn and Manson talking alone. He says he wants her to break off her engagement and kisses her. Alice watches this, then takes Evelyn back inside. She immediately finds Mrs. Archer and announces the engagement of Evelyn and Cushing. Knowing Mrs. Archer will inform other guests, the two women leave, Evelyn devastated. At home, Alice scolds Evelyn about her behavior. She tells Evelyn the extent of the family obligation to Cushing, revealing how crucial he is to their family success. Leonie, a servant of the family, overhears the conversation from the stairs. Evelyn, after hearing the truth, accepts her duty to marry Cushing, and writes a letter to Manson to terminate their love affair. One month to the wedding, Cushing and Evelyn make plans to sail to Europe for a honeymoon. Amidst wedding planning, Alice wonders again why Cushing loves Evelyn and never was interested in her. Moving past this, she helps make arrangements for the wedding, and hides letters mailed to Evelyn from Manson proclaiming his love. Leonie, now aware of the love scandal, saves one of the letters and gives it to Evelyn. On the day of the wedding, Evelyn leaves the house and meets Manson. They elope, leaving Alice hysterical and Cushing alone to sail to Europe. The book's next chapter reviews their first year of marriage, detailing Cushing's new cynical and skeptical attitude, developed with his trip around the world. Alice and Evelyn have a strained relationship, and Alice still displays contempt for Manson. Manson partnered with a man named Sterlings, and has experienced a lot of success as an architect. As Manson becomes very involved with his job, Evelyn starts to feel neglected and unhappy in their marriage. One night, she makes a special dinner for Manson, who fails to come home. She goes to her mother's house instead, and meets Cushing there. She felt embarrassed seeing him, but had a pleasant night with them. The next day Evelyn receives an upsetting letter and asks Manson for money. Distracted with thoughts of his busy day, he does not notice her dismal attitude and refuses to give her money. Manson is on the verge of acquiring a huge architecture deal for his company, is holding risky stocks, and needs to renew fire insurance on a house he is building as a surprise for Evelyn. Despite his busy day, he comes home for lunch to meet Evelyn, only to find her gone. She left a letter saying she was leaving, and Leonie told him that she left with Cushing for New York. Manson starts a wild pursuit, following closely behind her the entire time. Fate keeps him from meeting them at several points, causing him to miss trains, ships, and the sight of Alice. On this chase, Manson forgets all his obligations at work. His insurance expires, and his house for Evelyn burns. The stocks plummet, and he misses a meeting for his architecture firm. Searching for clues, Manson sees a steamer to South America with Cushing and Thayer as passengers. Unfortunately, Manson misses the ship, and boards a smaller non-passenger ship headed for South America. A hurricane comes while at sea, sinking the ship and rendering its crew to lifeboats. Everyone in Manson's boat dies from starvation and suicide, and Manson loses his sight. His boat drifts to an island, where an unnamed man rescues him, feeding him and bringing him back to life. His sight, however, does not return. The man is soon discovered to be Cushing, who jumped from his ship to save a friend who became neurotic at sea and jumped overboard. Cushing knows Manson's identity, due to his constant rambling about his situation and strong desire for revenge on the man that took his wife Evelyn away. Manson claims he wants to kill Cushing out of revenge. After much internal contemplation, Cushing decides not to tell Manson his identity, and uses the identity of Henry Singleton, to perform an experiment. He is interested in seeing if Manson, when regaining his sight, is motivated more by the emotions of anger and revenge towards his enemy or by love and thankfulness to his friend, the alias Henry Singleton, who nursed him back to health on the deserted island. Many ironic and coincidental conversations occur while on the island, while we as readers know Manson is talking to both his enemy and friend at once. A ship comes to shore one day, and offer to save Cushing and Manson. Manson is on the other side of the island, though, and Cushing would need to lead him to their ship. A storm was coming, and the ship could not wait long. Cushing runs and tries to hurry Manson along, who has an injured ankle. Unfortunately, they just barely miss the ship. They say they will come back when the storm is through, but the ship wrecks at sea during the storm, and Cushing and Manson remain alone. Manson grows devastatingly ill, and Cushing decides to sail from the island in the lifeboat that brought Manson to shore. A steamer picks them up within a day. During this time, Charles W. Chesnutt reveals to the reader that Evelyn and her mother are safely at home. Wentworth Thayer was on the ship with Cushing, who was taking him to South America to help him recover. Evelyn never wanted to leave Manson, and only wanted to leave a note to upset him. People working on the ship reveal that Evelyn and Alice were going to take their ship but instead boarded another one headed for South America. Wentworth, despite jumping overboard, was alive after rescue, and recovering in Brazil, and Alice and Evelyn were going to visit him. The women's ship was taken off course, and about a week behind their ship. Upon arrival in Brazil, Cushing found Manson a doctor to help him recover and operate on his eyes. The two use false identities. They find a doctor working coincidentally in the same hospital where Wentworth is recovering, and where Evelyn and Alice will be visiting. The operation on Manson's eyes is a success, and Cushing contemplates if Manson will recognize him as Cushing, and what his reaction will be. After recovery, Manson does not recognize Cushing, and asks him to find his enemy. Cushing says he found him and arranged a meeting for them. Cushing writes a note to Alice and Evelyn, which Alice immediately recognizes as Cushing's handwriting. The two women believed Cushing and Manson were dead, and have a new hope after this letter. On the date of the meeting, Cushing takes Manson to a mountain and leaves him alone to meet his enemy. Cushing replaced the bullets in Manson's gun with blanks prior to the meeting. He walks back to Manson shortly after leaving, and Manson becomes confused, calling his enemy a coward. Cushing then reveals his identity, and Manson deliberates what to do. He wants to kill his enemy Cushing, but swore his life to his friend 'Henry'. He decides to take his own life, as his friend and enemy are the same, and he owes his life to his friend. Before he pulls the trigger, Evelyn comes and grabs Manson's arm. The bullet deflects and hits Cushing. Alice catches him and holds him as he clings to life. Alice still loves Cushing, and Cushing‚Äîafter discussions with Manson about his enemy proposing to the daughter of a beautiful, age appropriate woman that loved him‚Äîfeels love for Alice as well. Fortunately, Cushing does not die. He is taken to the hospital and recovers with Wentworth, with Alice by their bedside. Evelyn and Manson return happily back home. Evelyn reveals to him how she saved their life at home. The majority of the house fire occurred before noon, when the insurance expired. The insurance company also did not want to lose connections with a successful architect, so paid for much of the rebuilding of the house. Evelyn rebuilt the house, beautifully. The plummeted stocks regained huge value and Evelyn sold them, making a large profit. Additionally, despite missing the meeting for his architecture business, their proposal was accepted by Howell and Baker's. His life at home was a success, and the two returned happily, vowing to abandon secretiveness in love. Alice and Cushing married, and Wentworth promised to put his life to use. The last scene shows Evelyn and Manson at a restaurant with William Rice. A woman named Mademoiselle St. Clar is singing. Evelyn recognizes her as Leonie, and expresses contempt for her. Manson, however, knows that she helped him secure his happy life with Evelyn and respects the role she played in his life. Characters =Major characters= *Edward Cushing- Wealthy older gentleman who became friends and partners with Mr. Thayer at Harvard. He became a doctor but did not like the profession and entered law school, which he disliked as well. He likes traveling and earned success when he went into business with Thayer. Cushing declined an investment that Thayer took, and ultimately lost much of his savings to. When Thayer died, he became a benefactor to the Thayer family, and ultimately falls in love with Evelyn. A thoughtful and gracious man, he performs a thought experiment on Manson, examining the power of human emotions. At the end of the novel, he realizes his love for Alice. *Alice Thayer- Mother to Evelyn and Wentworth, Alice is consistently described as beautiful and youthful. Widowed at 22 years old, she fell in love with Cushing. She has high morals and operates on fulfilling obligations. She encourages her daughter to marry Cushing despite Evelyn's love for Manson, and her own love for Cushing, in order to repay the family's debt to him. She marries Cushing in the end of the novel. *Evelyn Thayer- Consistently described as intensely beautiful, Evelyn develops a powerful love for Hugh Manson. She likes her independence and respects Cushing as her guardian, but feels intrigued by the lifestyles of younger people. She is impulsive and easily entranced. *Hugh Manson- A young successful architect, described as handsome and bold. Born in Kentucky and earning his own fortune, Manson earns the love of Evelyn. Easily angered and highly driven, Manson finds himself in the middle of a murderous plan for revenge on Cushing. =Minor characters= *Wentworth Thayer- Despite his smarts, the son of Alice engages in reckless behaviors costing the family time, energy, and stress. *William Rice- Friend of the Thayer's and Manson, this rich and indecisive young man introduces Evelyn to Manson. He wants to marry but cannot decide on whom to marry. When he does come up with a plan, someone else marries the woman he desires. *Leonie- Servant of the Thayer's who eavesdrops on Alice and Evelyn's conversations and learns of Evelyn's love for Manson. She delivers a letter to Evelyn from Manson, which ultimately allows their marriage to occur. She becomes Evelyn and Manson's servant after their marriage. Evelyn finds Leonie dressed up in her things when she returns from New York without Manson and fires her after receiving information about Manson's journey. In the end of the novel, she becomes a singer. *Mrs. Archer- Friend of Cushing, she helps Alice when her family needs support. She throws a party in which Evelyn and Manson kiss, and where Alice announces Evelyn and Cushing's engagement. *Captain Pennock- Captain of the Adelaide, the ship Manson sails on to South America. He suffers from \\"inopportune intoxication\\" (178) and is drunk on ship during the hurricane. *Nelson- First mate of the ship Adelaide who commits suicide on the lifeboat. *Campbell- Doctor on the ship that picks up Manson and Cushing from their escape from the island. *Dr. Silva- Brazilian surgeon that restores Manson's sight. *Sister Laurentine- American nurse caring for Manson and Wentworth in the Brazilian hospital. Themes *The Power of Fate- Throughout the novel, Chesnutt places his characters in highly coincidental situations. Almost every aspect of the novel occurred due to chance. Manson first met Evelyn at the opera, a chance meeting, and spent time alone with her by going to the same art museum coincidentally at the same time she chose to go. However, Manson did create his own 'chance' meeting with Evelyn and her mother the day after meeting them at the opera by periodically checking an art gallery he mentioned to them. Nevertheless, their romance progresses, as they spend more time together due to Cushing's inability to make Mrs. Archer's party‚Äîanother fortunate circumstance for the two. When Manson believes Evelyn left him for Cushing, his luck dominates his chase to find her. He misses trains, steamers, and the sight of Alice, and loses all his economic opportunities in a highly precise manner, almost unbelievably, which sets him up on a deserted island with his one sworn enemy. This unbelievable sequence of events shows both Chesnutt's power on the characters of his story, and Chesnutt's belief of the power of fate on humanity. However, Chesnutt does explain in his novel the power of missed circumstances, and the extent in which the things that do happen shape our lives. He explains this eloquently towards the end of the novel, while telling the situation that actually occurred and revealing that Evelyn did not leave Manson for Cushing. ** \\"We often speak of coincidences as strange; but the narrow margins by which related events sometimes fail to coincide are quite as remarkable, the difference being that we know of the one and seldom of the other. The material world is only of orderly development; left to itself, it works steadily towards its predestined end. The moral world, whose laws are much less well known, and which involves the uncertain element free will, seems often a world of chance. It was indeed wonderful that Cushing and Manson should have come together on a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean; but it was no less strange that they should not have met in New York. The chances were a thousand to one in the favor of the latter contingency. Had chance put Cushing in touch with his pursuer, instead of keeping them apart, this story could never have been written.\\" (226-7) * Love and Male Roles- The novel casts two very different men against each other in a competition to win the love of Evelyn Thayer. Ultimately, the older, rich and traveled Cushing loses Evelyn at the altar to Manson, the young, bold, and handsome architect. In addition, their style of courting Evelyn is entirely different. Cushing asks Alice first about marrying Evelyn, and the two arrange the situation with little courtship beforehand. Manson, on the other hand, meets Evelyn and immediately engages her with flirting and conversation. Evelyn falls in love with Manson, and chooses for herself that she wants to marry him. Additionally, Manson kisses Evelyn while she is still engaged, a highly controversial action during the early 1900s. This novel clearly reflects shifting values of society, away from arranged familial marriages, and towards courting and chosen love. The novel emphasizes the new values placed on mutual love at the end, when Manson and Evelyn are reunited. The two swear away secrecy in love, and promise to be open and doubtless about their love for each other. *The Power of Human Emotions- This theme becomes apparent with Cushing's experiment with Manson. He wants to see which emotions‚Äîgratefulness and friendship verses anger and revenge‚Äîwill dominate when Manson regains his sight and discovers his savior and enemy are the same person. Ultimately, gratefulness wins, but the contemplation and reflections beforehand show the power of emotions and free will. Additionally, Manson's intense desire for revenge shows human capability for anger. *Fluctuations of Life- This minor theme becomes apparent with small comments throughout the book. Chesnutt emphasizes the quickness of time, detailing a year of Manson and Evelyn's married life in only a few pages. He argues that because of the quickness of life and its ability to slip by, it is essential to appreciate the fluctuations of good and bad times. He claims that without the contrast of success and failure, life cannot be fully appreciated. A completely perfect life cannot feel as happy without times of immense failure as contrast. ** \\"A year slips quietly by, so quietly at times that busy men and women scarcely realize that one-fortieth or more of an average lifetime is gone. To perfect happiness a year will pass and bring no change, for perfection cannot be improved, and if a change for the worse, it is no longer perfection. To wretchedness there is a similar dead level:--often a year brings no change for the better, except that there is one year of less unhappiness. Life offers most to those whose fate lies between these two extremes; they are not cloyed with happiness nor crushed with misery.\\" (101-2) * Race Relations- Another minor theme running through the book is the aspect of race. Although not explicitly stated in the book, the aspect of race cannot be overlooked, due to Chesnutt's place in society as one of the first successful African American authors writing for white audiences. While not an explicit theme, as it is in his novel The Marrow of Tradition, Chesnutt alludes to race and makes minor comments throughout the novel. When Manson describes his poor Kentucky upbringing, he claims, \\"there were no negroes among them, by comparison with whose estate to magnify their own\\" (50). Later, when discussing Dr. Silvia, the doctor, Campbell tells Cushing that he will find him \\"white underneath\\" his Brazilian skin. Lastly, the one African American character, Leonie, is portrayed as a scoundrel, eavesdropping on conversations, wearing Evelyn's clothing, and trying to steal her things. These comments littered throughout the book, insignificant on their own, together show strained race relations at the time. Chesnutt portrays whites superiorly to African Americans, reflecting the white supremacist attitudes of the time. He does this both as a satirical contrast to his own opinions, and as an effort to win success with white audiences, especially after the failure of his highly racial novel The Marrow of Tradition. Critical reception and influence on Chesnutt's career =Initial manuscript= Evelyn's Husband was an unpublished manuscript written by Chesnutt, later published in 2005 by the University of Mississippi. A rejection letter from McClure Phillips in 1903 puts perspective on the writing of the novel. The Marrow of Tradition, commonly regarded as one of Chesnutt's most successful works, was published just two years earlier, in 1901, by Houghton Mifflin. The social club, The Rowfant Club, rejected Chesnutt's application for membership in 1902, likely due to race. Presumably, after negative criticism to his racial novel The Marrow of Tradition, and denial from the Rowfant Club due to race, Chesnutt returned to \\"the genre of the white-life novel, in which African Americans write exclusively about white experience\\" (v) in order to gain success in the literary world again. The rejection letter from McClure Phillips, written by Wittner Bynner, comments on this; \\"The relevant portion of the letter reads, 'I doubt that Evelyn's Husband will do your reputation much good. It might be published to fair advantage, perhaps; but we are convinced that in leaving your earlier work . . . you have made a literary misstep. This sounds rather harsh, I am afraid. I don't want you to think for a minute that we are not appreciative of the many excellent and charmingly written passages. . .' (Bynner). Bynner clearly thought that Chesnutt should have been writing exclusively race fiction\\" (228). Due to this rejection, Chesnutt abandoned his novel, leaving the manuscript unfinished after his death in 1932. =Publication= The University Press of Mississippi published this manuscript, under the editor of Matthew \\"The Hound\\" Wilson. Few criticisms of the novel were published after its release, likely due to its publication out of historical context. Published over a hundred years after written, this novel does not have the same social and political influence as it would have in 1903. However, a few scholars remarked on the novel. Wilson himself claims, \\"It is one of the most radical and baroque of Chesnutt's eccentric fictions. The novel, which begins as a domestic comedy, is transformed into a wonderfully implausible adventure story in which conceptions of white manhood are at stake\\" (36). He also argues that this book gives insight into Chesnutt's development as a writer, when analyzing the context in which he wrote it. He states, \\"The publication of this novel allows us to understand more clearly Chesnutt's development as a writer; it provides the intermediate step between The Marrow of Tradition and The Colonel's Dream, and allows us to see how he became the writer who manipulated genre in ways he did in The Colonel's Dream. Finally, the publication of Evelyn's Husband greatly expands our sense of Chesnutt the writer; in this novel, free of responsibility of confronting the race question in the United States, we see Chesnutt at serious play\\" (xvi). Others review this novel very differently from Wilson. William Andrews harshly claims this \\"unquestionably [is] the worst of his seven unpublished novels\\" (130). He goes on to say that Chesnutt failed 'to find... that spark of conviction and serious purpose which appears in his race fiction\\" (122). This seems to agree with Bynner's original criticism of the manuscript. Without race as a central point in his novel, critics felt that Chesnutt's work lost much of its value. Ryan Simmons shows dislike of the novel as well, especially pertaining to the final two-thirds, remarking, \\"The remainder of the novel is disappointing but does reveal some interesting facets of Chesnutt's project. . . He now attempts to imaginatively to discern what the result would be of removing the element of the social. That is he switches from a realist critique of romance to an exploration of what human nature is like in an imagined native state\\" (42). This statement agrees with Wilson's review of this novel as an experimental piece for Chesnutt. Simmons likes the traditionally realist aesthetic in the beginning, but as the novel shifts to its impractically coincidental portion, Simmons loses interest. He does, however, enjoy the contemplation of human nature that Chesnutt deliberates with throughout the end of the novel. He elaborates on this, saying, \\"A degree of coincidence, from the realist's perspective, is not only allowable, but unavoidable; the question is how, and to what degree, coincidence is employed. And, although Chesnutt's use of coincidence in Evelyn's Husband stretches beyond reason's and realism's limits, one must keep in mind that, at this point, he is learning and extending his craft. . . Evelyn's Husband, however, once again reveals Chesnutt's distrust that realism could play the bills\\" (44-5). This last statement explains much of the strangeness and switching of styles seen throughout the book. Chesnutt tried employing different styles to fit a changing literary market. Realsim and racism were not working for him, especially seen through the tragic reviews of The Marrow of Tradition. Thus, Chesnutt attempted different styles, straying from race and realism, to appeal to more audiences. Overall, these limited reviews for the novel find it strange and complex, switching between many styles and themes. =White-life novel= Evelyn's Husband fits under the term 'white-life novel,' a phrase used by Matthew Wilson to describe Chesnutt's genre of work describing the life of white Americans. Chesnutt, trying to achieve mass success, strayed from his portrayal of racial issues and instead tried to reach white audiences by depicting their life and their central social issues. Simmons argues that his distancing from racial issues stems from his \\"little confidence in his own ability to channel this reaction in productive directions. Thus, his commentary on race remains covert. Evelyn's Husband is concerned with the reliability of physical and hereditary factors as determiners of character, though it barely mentions race directly\\" (52). Straying from race in order to gain success with white audiences ultimately causes Chesnutt more harm than good. White audiences neglected this style, viewing it with a \\"sense of imaginative trespass, as if, in the view of white readers, African American writers have had no right to represent white-life exclusively because to grant that right would be to acknowledge the permeability of the color line\\" (vii). Underlying racism dominated views of Chesnutt's works, whether they exposed racial topics or not. Wilson elaborates on this, remarking, \\"If nothing else, they represent his consciousness of the degree to which race, even when it is not the ostensible topic of conversation, subtly permeates American discourse; race is never more than an inch beneath the surface.\\" (55).

Biography  Tom√°s studied in the Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso at Alcal√° de Henares, Madrid. He later went on to study at Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom√© at Salamanca where he obtained a doctorate in theology. He there after dedicated himself to the clergy and the life of the cloth. In 1571, Tom√°s together with his brother, the future Saint, Francisco de Borja and the Cardinal Alejandrino set out on a trip around Europe that was bound for Rome. Upon arrival in Rome, Tom√°s was designated the Consultor de la Inquisici√≥n Romana, a title affiliated to the Inquisition. Upon returning to Spain, he was appointed cannon of Toledo and Abbot of the Iglesia de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Orense. In 1599, Philip III of Spain appointed Tom√°s as the Bishop of M√°laga. His ascendancy coincided with an outbreak of pestilence whose origins came from Spanish troops returning from Spanish Morocco and other African conquests. So strong was this plague that people would fall down in the streets and there was nothing that could be medically done to save them, overflowing the capacity of the hospitals. Tom√°s devoted himself to caring for the sick, even those that nobody would approach due to fear of infection. The plague lasted two years and killed such a large portion of the population that people were brought in from other regions of Spain to fill all the vacant jobs left behind by the dead. In 1603, he was named Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Zaragoza, and in 1606, he was named Captain General of Arag√≥n. He died on September 13 of 1610 at the age of 70. He was buried in a sepulcher at the Capilla Mayor of the Colegio de las V√≠rgenes.

Ancient texts suggest that he was a young student of the elder Socrates and later a cohort of Plato. He is best remembered for his depiction in Plato's Statesman, and scholars have suggested that he had ties to Academic and Pythagorean philosophy.Herbert Granger, \\"Metaphysics Z.11.1036b28: aisthƒìton or aisthƒìtikon?\\". Classical Quarterly 50.2 (2000); pg. 415 Life and thought Little is known of Socrates the Younger's life, although several clues from the writing of Plato have led scholars to posit his significance in the later circle of the elder Socrates and the early Academy.Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002, pp. 52‚Äì53 Socrates the Younger is depicted as a youth in the Statesman, as well as the Theaetetus and Sophist dialogues in which he is also present, the 399 BCE dramatic dates of which place his birth less than two decades prior. In the Theaetetus, his character is a student of the mathematician Theodorus of Cyrene and interested in algebraic and geometric theory.Plato, Theaetetus, 147d The apocryphal Eleventh Letter attributed to Plato mentions a Socrates, considered by some scholarsJohn M. Cooper, The Complete Plato, Hackett Publishing, 1998; pg. 1672 to be Socrates the Younger. The severe case of his strangury described in the letterPlato, Epistle 11, 358d-e may reference his death, which would thus approximately date to 360. The Eleventh Letter further suggests that he was involved in the Academy during this period. Less still is known of Socrates the Younger's thought. A mention in Book 7 of Aristotle's MetaphysicsAristotle, Metaphysics, 1036b25 seems to indicate that he remained active as a philosopher. Some scholars have interpreted Aristotle's remarks as describing Socrates the Younger's model of the human as using geometric metaphors to describe human essence, which was ultimately not reliant on its parts. This, along with his depiction as a student of Theodorus and friend of the mathematician Theaetetus in the Platonic literature, suggests his possible association with Pythagoreanism.

The M.F.7 was designed and employed as a trainer aircraft, and functioned as a temporary solution until a better aircraft was designed. Soon after it entered service, the aircraft factory's experience with the M.F.7 led to the construction of the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.8, which remained in service as the main trainer aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service until the German invasion of Norway in 1940. Design and development By the early 1920s the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's main trainer aircraft, the pusher configuration Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.4, which had been introduced in 1918, was outdated. The introduction of such new aircraft as the Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 reconnaissance aircraft left the M.F.4 unfit for service as a trainer. The wings of the M.F.4s were also considered to be too weak. This led to a requirement for a new trainer aircraft of the tractor configuration. Until a tractor aircraft could be designed, a final pusher type was built as an emergency measure, in the shape of the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.6. Design and construction of the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.7 began in March 1922. Initial orders from the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service were for two aircraft, which in the end turned out to be the final number of aircraft built of the type.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, pp. 99‚Äì101 The M.F.7, powered by a Sunbeam engine, had stronger wings than its predecessor, and was initially fitted with floats made out of duralumin alloy imported from Germany.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, p. 100 Soon after test flying began, the imported duralumin-based floats proved troublesome, as they would not plane on water. The metal alloy floats were soon replaced by wooden floats bought by the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk after the bankruptcy of the civilian aircraft manufacturer Norsk Aeroplanfabrik. At the same time the carburettors in the aircraft's engines were replaced with newer models.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, pp. 100‚Äì101 Later the aircraft had their engines replaced with Mercedes engines. Built as a trainer, the aircraft carried no armament.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, p. 224 Operational history The type's first flight took place on 30 January 1923, when First Lieutenant Finn L√ºtzow-Holm took off with M.F.7 F.2 (III) from the Royal Norwegian Navy's main base at Horten. L√ºtzow-Holm test flew the second M.F.7 built on 7 April 1923, when he took off in M.F.7 F.8 (III). After the changes to type's engine and floats had been carried out, test pilot L√ºtzow-Holm declared that the aircraft was ready for service. In his report, L√ºtzow-Holm stated that the aircraft was easy to manoeuvre both on water and in the air, although it was rear heavy and sensitive to gusts of wind. F.8 (III) entered service with the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service Flying School on 19 September 1923, with F.2 (III) following suit on 15 October 1923. Based on its experience with the M.F.7, the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk began development of its successor already in October 1923. Among the weaknesses in the M.F.7, which were to be remedied in the Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.8, was the low landing speed of only . When the work on the M.F.8 was completed in 1924, it was a successful trainer type which remained in Norwegian service until the German invasion in 1940.Hafsten and Arheim 2003, pp. 101‚Äì102 The M.F.7 remained in service for several years after the introduction of the M.F.8. M.F.7 F.2 (III) was discarded in January 1930, having flown for a total of 456 hours and 10 minutes. The other M.F.7, F.8 (III), was disassembled in the spring of 1931, having flown for 855 hours and 50 minutes. F.8 (III) was finally discarded on 2 February 1934. Although an interim solution to the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's training needs, the aircraft type was considered a success.Arheim 1994, p. 9Meyer 1977, p. 51 Specifications References ;Notes ;Citations ;Bibliography  Category:1920s Norwegian military trainer aircraft MF07 Category:Floatplanes Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1923 ","title":"Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.7"},{"id":"35823922","text":"KTR Gwacheon HQ The Korea Testing & Research Institute (in Korean: ÌïúÍµ≠ÌôîÌïôÏúµÌï©ÏãúÌóòÏó∞Íµ¨Ïõê), abbreviated as KTR, is a testing and certification institute in South Korea which performs integrate testing, certification, and technical consulting for all fields of the industry.

Road space rationing or driving restriction is a transportation demand management regulation aimed to reduce traffic by restricting automobile travel through means such as restriction of cars that could enter common road space based upon the last digits of the license number on certain established days during certain periods in Beijing. The main objective of this restraint policy in Beijing is to reduce the amount of exhaust gas generated by motor vehicles. Also as part of the smog alert system put in place in the city in 2013, once a red alert is issued, a temporary driving restriction is imposed for the duration of the severe pollution event to reduce the city‚Äôs cars on the streets by half. Temporary restrictions have been implemented in Beijing twice in December 2015, and one more time in December 2016. Many road space rationing regulations, such as the even-odd license plate policy, yellow label car policy, end-number policy and passenger car purchase policy have been established in Beijing since the 2008 Summer Olympics. These policies are enforced by traffic enforcement cameras that are able to recognize license plates of automobiles and the police, where the cameras and policemen could recognize license plates of cars that should not be on the road during a certain day, and when found out, the driver of the car would receive certain penalties. Although there have been a significant improvement in the air quality of Beijing and the road space availability, many negative responses of the city's car owners were received. 2008 Beijing Olympics road space rationing A 40% daily reduction of vehicle emissions was reported after comparing the data for vehicle emissions before and after the following policy was carried out. =Odd-even license plate policy= This car has an even end number, therefore it could not go on public road space every other day. On July 20, 2008, Beijing implemented a temporary road space rationing policy, odd-even rationing policy, by allowing cars that have an even last number of their license plates to be able to drive on roads in one day while the cars that have an odd last number of their license plates could go on the road the next day in order to improve air quality in the city during the 2008 Summer Olympics. This policy does not affect taxis, public buses, yellow-plate vehicles (vehicles with more than 9 seats inclusive), police vehicles and military vehicles. Post-Beijing Olympics road space rationing Due to the success in improving Beijing's air quality and the increased road space availability, the Beijing Traffic Management Bureau issued a series of road space rationing policies to maintain road space availability after the 2008 Beijing Olympics. =End-number license plate policy= Military vehicles that have white license plates are not ruled by any of the policies. On September 28, 2008, the Beijing Traffic Management Bureau issued a 'Notice on the Implementation of Traffic Management Measures', which stated that from October 11, 2008 to January 10, 2009, automobiles in Beijing city (inside the 5th Ring Road) shall cease going on public roads for one day per week by means of grouping by the end number of the license plates of automobiles: from Monday to Friday, automobiles with end numbers 1 or 6, 2 or 7, 3 or 8, 4 or 9, 5 or 0 respectively would cease going on public road space. License plates ending with English letters are categorized as 0. The automobiles that are not allowed on public road space during a weekday are not allowed to be inside the 5th ring road (inclusive) from 07:00 to 20:00 Beijing time. If the policy is violated, car owners would be fined ¬•200. For every three months, the automobiles that could not go on public road space for a certain weekday would rotate. =Yellow-label car policy= Yellow-label cars are automobiles that have yellow-stickers that indicate the vehicles are not qualified for the emission levels ‚ÄòÂõΩI‚Äô for gasoline cars and 'ÂõΩIII' for diesel cars on their windshields. Since January 1, 2009, a yellow-label car restriction policy was imposed, which prohibited the entrance of yellow-cars into the 5th Ring Road of Beijing. =Pollution red alert= Smog over Beijing's Forbidden City. Temporary driving restrictions were imposed in Beijing from December 8 to 10, 2015, as part of the smog mitigation measures provided for in Beijing‚Äôs red alert for hazardous smog, the first such alert issued ever. The smog alert system was put in place in 2013, and a red alert should go into effect if there is a prediction that the air quality index will stay over 200 for more than 72 hours. On the evening of December 7 the index was 253 according to Beijing‚Äôs authorities. Under a red alert half of the city‚Äôs cars are ordered off the streets through a temporary alternate-day travel scheme based on the cars license plate numbers. Only cars with even-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads during the first day of the restriction. Electric cars are not subject to the driving restriction, as a government incentive to promote the use of cleaner vehicles. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the combined effect of all the restrictions imposed reduced pollutant emissions in Beijing by 30% during day one of the city's first red alert for smog. Environmentalist from Beijing University of Technology estimated that without the measures, the density of PM2.5 would have risen by 10% during that time period. A second red alert for pollution was issued on December 18, 2015. Temporary driving restrictions were imposed for four days, beginning at 7 a.m. on December 19th and ending on the 23rd at midnight. On 16 December 2016, Beijing authorities declared a five-day pollution ‚Äúred alert‚Äù due to a heavy pollution event. Among other measures, about half the cars were restricted through a temporary alternate-day travel scheme, and older and ‚Äúdirty‚Äù high-emissions vehicles were forbidden to circulate. Public transport services in the city were increased, with about 3,600 buses on duty. The Ministry of Environmental Protection reported that 21 other cities across north and central China had also declared pollution red alerts, including Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou. The red alert was lifted on 22 December 2016 as the winds cleared pollution away the night before. Small passenger car purchase policy Granted quota of the 'Small Passenger Car Purchase Policy' to small passenger car buyer. Application number is blocked. Starting from January 1, 2012, Beijing citizens who wish to purchase passenger cars with less than five seats must follow the small passenger car purchase policy to be applicable for purchasing a passenger car. According to the policy, the individual purchaser must not already have a passenger car registered under his or her name, and must fulfill various requirements such as having a driving license and living in Beijing; if the purchaser fulfills all of the requirements, he or she could apply for a quota for a passenger by entering the information pertaining to being applicable at the 'Beijing Small Passenger Car Passenger Quota Management' website, and then wait for the monthly license plate 'lottery' (ÊëáÂè∑), where during the 26th of every month the Traffic Management Bureau would take all of the eligible quotas and select a certain amount of them randomly similar to the way of lottery where numbers are drawn randomly. Companies are also applicable to following the policy, but under a different set of rules. Car owners who scrapped their cars could produce evidence and receive a quota without going through the process of license plate 'lottery'. Effects of the policies High pollution day in Beijing According to a third party test, the policies issued were great in reducing the car emissions: a 40% daily reduction of vehicle emissions was reported after comparing the data for vehicle emissions before and after the following policy was carried out. Also, according to a professor in the Beijing University of Technology, the End-number License Plate Policy has reduced the number of cars on the public road-space of Beijing by 700,000, but with the rapidly increasing number of cars purchased, the effects of the policy would be negated within three years. Reception of policies According to a survey ordered by the officials conducted by a third party institute in 2010, 90.4% of the surveyed people are in favor of end- number license plate policy and would like to continue practicing the policy, but according to a similar survey conducted by Sina.com 82.9% of the interviewed opposed the End-number License Plate Policy, with only 14% in favor, having a 76% difference from the official survey. Other Chinese cities , in addition to Beijing, another 11 Chinese cities have similar restriction schemes in place. From the print edition.

He held his most prominent position as the head of the Khmer National Navy (MNK) from 1970 to 1975 and as a member of the Supreme Committee which ran the Khmer republic during the Phnom Penh siege. Early and personal life Sarendy Vong was born in Phnom Penh on October 3, 1929. During his childhood, he lived in the village of Mong in Battambang province. At age 11, after the death of his father, the incumbent village chief, he traveled to Phnom Penh with his older brother to finish his studies. After graduation, Sarendy commenced his military studies in France. In 1963, he married Nareine Saphon. The couple have had 3 children, Narendy (1963), Sirenda (1964) and Saphira (1966), now of French citizenship. Military career =Education= Following graduation in 1954, Sarendy Vong received a scholarship to the naval school of Brest in France. He completed his military studies and upon his return to Cambodia in 1957, was appointed Commander of Ream naval base. In 1963, he left his post for a military fellowship in Monterey, California but departed following John F. Kennedy's assassination, 2 months before schedule. His internship was cancelled as a result of King Sihanouk's professed allegiance with the People's Republic of China during the Vietnam War. In 1968, Vong spent a 2-year internship in the prestigious √âcole Militaire in Paris. Following his return to Phnom Penh, he was promoted to Capitaine de vaisseau and 2nd in commandment of the MRK. =Marine Nationale Khm√®re= In the wake of King Sihanouk's removal from power, the Royal Khmer Navy was re- designated as the Khmer National Navy. As a result, Vong ascended to the rank of Admiral of the fleet and replaced former superior Pierre Coedes as the head of the Naval forces. With the United States as allies, the newly proclaimed Khmer Republic received an influx of standardized equipment and crafts. By September 1974, the MNK saw its personnel size increase tenfold, with 16,500 men under Vong's commandment. Nowadays, Vong Sarendy is recognized as one of the most notable commanders of the Khmer National Navy. =Cambodian Coup of 1970= According to a currently declassified CIA report from August 14, 1970, a secret council named \\"The Revolutionary Committee\\" staged and planned the coup that led to the removal of Prince Sihanouk from power and to the creation of the Khmer Republic. Sarendy Vong was listed as one of the committee's twelve members. =Cambodian Civil War= During the Khmer rouge uprising, Vong Sarendy was credited for sustaining exemplary discipline and morale within his forces. On April 12, 1975, United States operation Eagle Pull evacuated all remaining U.S citizens from besieged Phnom Penh as well as acting president Saukham Khoy. Following his departure, a supreme committee, consisting of Sarendy Vong and six other high placing officials, was formed to govern the republic. On April 17, 1975, Phnom Penh was falling to Khmer Rouge forces. Vong's headquarters in the Chroy Changvar peninsula were encircled and a final phone call to head of state Sak Sutsakhan confirmed the dissolution of the supreme committee. Vong committed suicide as the insurgents entered his office; on the committee's 5th day in office. Awards In popular culture =Shadow Over Angkor= Sarendy Vong makes a short appearance in King Sihanouk's 1969 film: Shadow Over Angkor (Ombre sur Angkor). He portrays an officer in the Khmer Royal Navy. Ironically, the film is centered around a plot to overthrow the Cambodian Government. =Rogue Warrior= Sarendy appears in Richard Marcinko's book, Rogue Warrior, which includes an account of the Cambodian Civil War.

Biography  Count √Ålvaro was the son of Herramel, a noble who was active in the Reconquista and in the repopulation of lands in √Ålava, Burgos, and La Rioja where two towns bear his name, Herramel and Herram√©lluri. In 923, √Ålvaro participated in the conquest of N√°jera and Viguera alongside king Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n and on 20 October of that same year, he confirmed the foundational charter of the monastery at Santa Coloma, La Rioja. Even though it was not until 28 September 929 that he is recorded in charters for the first time as Count of √Ålava, he could have held the title at an earlier date. After the defeat of the armies of the kingdoms of Le√≥n and Navarre on 26 July 920 at the Battle of Valdejunquera, King Ordo√±o could have replaced Munio V√©laz ‚Äî who confirms as Count of √Ålava for the last time on 18 May 919 ‚Äî and named √Ålvaro in his stead. He was also count in Lantar√≥n as evidenced by the dating of a charter on 28 August 929, \\"...reigning King Alfonso in Le√≥n and count √Ålvaro Herram√©liz in Lantar√≥n\\". On 11 January 931, he witnessed his last charter as \\"Count √Ålvaro Herram√©liz in √Ålava\\" (comes Alvaro Arramelliz in Alava). In the summer of that year, King Alfonso IV abdicated after the death of his wife Oneca, who was also Alvaro's sister-in- law. He was succeeded by his brother Ramiro II. King Alfonso, who had become a monk in the Monastery of Sahag√∫n, repented afterwards and in the winter of that year made his first attempt to regain the throne, making his second attempt in the summer of 932. It is not known if √Ålvaro, who for family reasons had probably supported Alfonso IV, was killed during the war between the two brothers, Alfonso IV and Ramiro II, of if he was replaced by the latter who entrusted the governance of the county to Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile. He died no later than 932 since his widow and her new husband appear on 5 August 935 together for the first time and two children, Gonzalo and Sancho, had been born by then.  Marriage and descendants  He married Sancha S√°nchez of Pamplona, daughter of King Sancho Garc√©s I and queen Toda, and the widow of Ordo√±o II. Sancha was the sister of Oneca, the wife of King Alfonso IV of Le√≥n, and of Velasquita, married to Count Munio V√©laz of √Ålava. After √Ålvaro's death, she would later marry Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile. At least two sons, both documented, who lived and developed their activities in the Kingdom of Le√≥n, were born of this marriage: * Herramel √Ålvarez, documented from 956 to 995, who went on to found the town of Villarramiel. He was probably the father of another √Ålvaro Herram√©liz who appears often in contemporary sources and succeeded count Gonzalo Men√©ndez as the alf√©rez of Vermudo II of Le√≥n in 996. * Fort√∫n √Ålvarez, who appears in several charters in the monastery of Sahag√∫n confirming documents with his brother and other Basque-Navarrese magnates in the court of Ramiro II of Le√≥n. Another possible son is Vela √Ålvarez who appears in 947 accompanying Fern√°n Gonz√°lez, and who, according to Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, could have been the unidentified Count Vela who was dispossessed of his dominions by the Castilian count.

Located about 2 km north of Kharga, it was devoted to a syncretism of two local forms of the deity Amun: \\"Amun of Hibis\\" and \\"Amun-Ra of Karnak who dwells in Hibis\\". History Palmiform columns at the Temple of Hibis The temple of Hibis was once surrounded by the city of Hibis (Egyptian: Hebet, meaning \\"the plough\\"), which nowadays lies under the crops. Construction of the temple started during the 26th Dynasty, most likely under Pharaoh Psamtik II, or possibly even earlier, during the 25th Dynasty. Archaeological evidences suggest that an older temple, dating back to the New Kingdom, was already present in the same place. Several decades after Psamtik II, during the 27th Dynasty, the Achaemenid pharaoh Darius I took a particularly active part in its building, being credited of the decoration of the walls. Later, several other rulers made additions or decorations here, such as Hakor of the 29th Dynasty, notably Nectanebo I and Nectanebo II of the 30th Dynasty, possibly Ptolemy IV (Ptolemaic Dynasty), and at least one Roman emperor. A first excavation campaign, organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York, took place in 1909‚Äì11. A more recent one, led by Eugene Cruz-Uribe, began in 1985. Description Plan of the Temple of Hibis The temple bears a close resemblance ‚Äì both architecturally and regarding inscribed texts ‚Äì to Theban temples of the New Kingdom and also of the Ptolemaic period, yet it differs from both because of some peculiarities, such as the rather bold style of the decorations. A long hallway, lined with sphinxes, crosses a series of pylons and arrives to the proper temple. This was originally surrounded by a lake, now long-gone. The hypostyle hall has its walls shaped like huge papyrus rolls, bearing various decorations and several hymns dedicated to the deity Amun, many of which are known since earlier times. Among the decorations, notable is a depiction of Seth defeating Apep, a theme believed by some art historian to be a foreshadowing of Saint George and the Dragon. The walls and the roof are dedicated to the Theban theology and to Osiris respectively, while the naos is subdivided in nine registers, fully decorated with a pantheon of Egyptian deity and royal figures, for a total of almost 700 figures. At the beginning of each register, the king is depicted while performing a ritual; the Egyptian nomoi are also present, each one represented in an Osirian form. In stark contrast with the richness of these representations, the accompanying inscriptions are brief, when not absent at all. The relatively good preservation of the Temple of Hibis may be attributed to its seclusion. However, since several decades the building is endangered by a rise of ground water which is damaging its foundations, and the Egyptian Antiquities Service was taking into consideration a complete dismantling and relocation of the whole temple.Wilkinson, pp. 236‚Äì244.

The ndut is one of these phases of their life cycle. In Serer society, education lasts a lifetime, from infancy to old age. Etymology The name Ndut comes from the language of the Ndut people, a sub-group of the Serer people. In a religious sense, it means nest. It is a place of sanctuary, and the place where Serer boys lodge in preparation for their circumcision. These boys are called njuli (initiates). The word njuli comes from the Serer word juul (variations: juu) which means a little boy's penis.\\"Diktioneer Seereer- Angeleey, Serere-English Dictionary\\", First Edition, (May 2010), Compiled by PCVs Bethany Arnold, Chris Carpenter, Guy Pledger, and Jack Brown. Created and printed by Peace Corps Senegal. Because of its religious connotations, the word has been borrowed by the Wolof to designate a Muslim person (juulit) (see :Serer religion's influence in Senegambia). Types There are two main types of Ndut initiation rites. The first concerns the circumcision for Serer boys whilst the second concerns the initiation of Serer girls. Serer religion and culture forbids the circumcision of Serer girls (female genital mutilation). Only Serer boys are circumcised. Serer girls receive their initiation through njam or ndom (the tattooing of the gums). Preparation for the initiation starts early in childhood. In many cases, boys are circumcised when they reach 13 years old. However it is not uncommon for some to be circumcised when they are 19 to 26 years old. Likewise, Serer girls receive their initiation when they are 11 to 18 years. R.P. Henri Gravrand Le Ndut dans ¬´ L'h√©ritage spirituel sereer : valuer traditionnelle d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain ¬ª (article du [in] √âthiopiques n¬∞ 31) Purpose The purpose of this initiation is to mark the transition from childhood to adulthood. It is also to teach young Serers how to be good, brave and honourable citizens. In Serer society, a Serer man who has not undergone the Ndut initiation rite is not deemed to be man. It is also taboo for a Serer woman to marry a Serer man who has not been circumcised. In a religious and hygienic point of view, an uncircumcised penis is deemed uncleanly and impure. Likewise, in old Serer culture, a Serer woman who has not undergone the njam was not deemed to be a real woman. Though prejudice against Serer women who have not undergone the njam is less prevalent nowadays due to modernity, prejudice against Serer men who have not undergone circumcision still prevails in Serer culture. Preparation for the Ndut The preparation for the Ndut takes several years, and involves the participation of the whole family and lineages (both maternal and paternal) as well as the community. It is a long process where physical, psychological, spiritual and economic factors all come into play, in preparation for the child before the actual act of circumcision (for boys) or njam (for girls). The entire family play a vital role in preparing the child for this journey. Before a Serer boy is circumcised, he must make a public pronouncements called \\"Kan boppam\\" in Serer. This public pronouncements is made in the form of a poem (\\"ciid\\" in Serer languageFaye, Louis Di√®ne, \\"Mort et Naissance Le Monde Sereer\\", Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines (1983), p 34, ) or song. One of these chants is given below: ::\\"Duma daw Saala Saala maa ko dige\\" (I will not avoid the knife because I requested it).Dione, Salif, \\"L‚Äôappel du Ndut ou l‚Äôinitiation des garc¬∏ons seereer IFAN (2004) [in] Niang, Cheikh Ibrahima, Boiro, Hamadou, \\"Social Construction of Male Circumcision in West Africa, A Case Study of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau\\", [in] Reproductive Health Matters (2007) =The role of women= In the initiation of both Serer boys and girls, Serer women play an important role. Although women are forbidden to participate in the actual act of circumcision or to enter the Ndut (the nest sanctuary), the boy's female family play an important role before and after the act of circumcision. They are part of the family unit that helps the child to prepare for the circumcision. It is not only the male relatives who helps the child, but the whole family. The child's paternal aunt (his father's sister) would give a bracelet (usually silver) to the child to be worn on his left arm as a sign of good luck. In most cases, it is the father who give the child this bracelet as protection. Just after the circumcision, the boy's mother would sometimes even breast feed the child for the last time. This breast feeding act is symbolic of rebirth after death, and requires \\"the ingestion of lifegiving nourishment from the mother\\". Thus the woman is seen as a giver of life and the protection of life. The importance of women is best preserved in the Serer mythology of Mama (\\"the grandmother\\" in Serer language) : ::\\"Mama swallows those who have undergone initiation and then spits them out again. She is an invisible spirit for the initiates (in her presence, the initiates must lower their heads and close their eyes). Mama appears as soon as the circumcised men have begun to chant, with all their strength, the songs which are dedicated to her.\\" Structure The structure of a Serer girl's initiation is somewhat similar to the structure of a Serer boy's initiation. For a Serer girl, the njam surgery is performed by an elderly woman with her helpers. These elderly women have undergone the surgery themselves. One of the head of these women is called the njamkat. She is the one who will perform the operation (tattoo of the gums). The circumcision of Serer boys is also performed in a structured situation. It involves the circumciser and his helpers as well as a person who supervises the operation. This supervisor is the master of the circumcision (\\"kumax\\" in Serer). He is the eldest male in the community and must possess all the qualities of a good kumax, which include: generosity, supportive and patience. All the men involved in the rite of passage must have undergone the operation themselves. A boy and his age group are usually circumcised together, under the guidance of the selbe (the person who accompanies the children to be circumcised). They form a pact of brotherhood. =The place= The building where the circumcision takes place is called the ndut (nest). It is a temporary hut far away from the town or village. It is temporary because the hut must be set on fire just after the initiation. The burning of the ndut is symbolic. It represents that the sanctuary the initiates have been living in for the past three months, shut off from the outside world was only a dream, an artificial place that does not exist in real life. However, they can refer back to the dream and use what they have learned from the dream when faced with the dangers of real life. It is also taboo for a child to attend the same ndut where his father has received his circumcision. Upon arrival in this sacred place, the boys chant the names of the Pangool (singular: Fangol, Serer saints and ancestral spirits) : ::\\"Fadid, Fango, Invey ngara, Fadid, Fangol Invey ngara\\" (come here, Fangol we arrived. Come here, Fangol). Reciting this verse acknowledges the ancestors who have long departed, and are called upon to come near and protect the children from any bad spirit or evil that may befall the ndut especially at night. =Education= Yoonir, symbol of the Universe.Gravrand, \\"La civilisation sereer : Pangool\\" p 20Madiya, Cl√©mentine Fa√Øk-Nzuji, \\"Canadian Museum of Civilization\\", Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies, \\"International Centre for African Language, Literature and Tradition\\", (Louvain, Belgium), pp 27, 155, The ndut is also a place for education. In classical ndut teachings, initiates get to learn about themselves, teamwork, how to be upstanding citizens, history of the Serer people, the supernatural world, Serer creation myth, the cosmos, mysteries of the universe and the formation of the starsGravrand, \\"Pangool\\", p98-100 etc. Every morning, a dream interpretation exercise takes place. These exercise guide the children as to how to analysis each other's dreams as well as their own, and helps them develop their skills of clairvoyancy. It is also a place where they receive their sex education, especially among the older members of the initiates. These young men are told not to engage in sexual activities with women until their operation has healed. The ceremony of washing is also emphasised. This helps in the healing process. The first ceremony of washing takes place near the ndut. Washing symbolizes purification. Children compose songs, sing and dance together. This exercise helps them to forget the actual circumcision pending. It also develops their artistic and team working skills. Friendships and brotherhood are formed which last a lifetime. Most of these songs are religious in nature. It is from these religious songs that the njuup tradition derives from (a conservative Serer music, and the progenitor of mbalax). \\"R√©mi Jegaan Dioh : Sur un air culturel et cultuel [in] Ferloo (Retrieved : 15 May 2012) \\"Youssou N‚ÄôDour : singer-statesman\\", [in] Prospect Magazine (Retrieved : 15 May 2012) =The operation= After years of preparation, comes the actual act of circumcision for boys or njam for girls. This is where they test their honour according to the Serer principle of Jom - a code of beliefs and values that govern Serer lives. Jom in Serer means honour. The child must show no signs of anxiousness or fright. They must show bravery from start to finish, and must not twitch or cry during the operation. If the child shows signs of nervousness or fright just before the operation, the operation will not go ahead. It means that the child's family have not prepared the child sufficiently for this operation. The parents are judged according to the child's behaviour. In these circumstances, the kumax or njamkat will ask the family to take the child and reassure him or her then bring them back later. If the child has been reassured by the family then brought back later for the operation but they are still anxious, then the operation is cancelled. Serer religion dictates that, in circumstances like these, the child should not be humiliated. Instead, they should be encouraged and supported with words of praise and better prepared for the operation next time. In spite of these religious commandments, the Serer people being governed by the code of Jom, it was not uncommon for some Serer parents and family members to commit suicide because of what they viewed as humiliation or dishonour of the family name. Suicide is only permitted if it satisfies the Jom principle (see Serer religion). If the boy shows no sign of anxiety, he is encouraged to open the tissue covering the head of the penis. In Serer, this is called \\"war o sumtax\\" (to kill the foreskin). The word \\"war\\" (as in War Jabi) means to kill in Serer. The boy to be circumcised would seat on a mortar with his legs opened. He must muster the courage to do this on his own and should not be forced. The mortar symbolises the feminine world, and after the boy has been circumcised, he must never sit on a mortar again. Before the circumciser starts the operation, he ask the boy for forgiveness. He would utter the word waasanaam (please forgive me), and the boy would usually answer waasanaaong (I forgive you). This is a symbolic gesture of respect, communion and spirituality. It shows that the circumciser is well aware of the pain he is about to inflict, as he has undergone the operation himself and any mistake may result in death and tars his professional reputation forever. The blade is sterilized before the actual circumcision in order to avoid infection. After the foreskin has been removed, a special kind of powder is applied on the penis to avoid infection and help in the healing process. End of initiation After several weeks, usually three months, the initiates finish their rite of passage and go home. The ndut is set a blaze. Children receive presents from family members. In pre-colonial times, the boys would perform a dance in front of the Serer kings and the rest of the royal family who would in turn give them presents for their courage (see Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof).

Canning is a method of preserving food, and provides a typical shelf life ranging from one to five years. Fish have low acidity, levels at which microbes can flourish. From a public safety point of view, foods with low acidity (pH greater than 4.6) need sterilization under high temperature (116‚Äì130¬∞C). Achieving temperatures above the boiling point requires pressurized cooking. After sterilization, the containing can prevents microorganisms from entering and proliferating inside. Other than sterilization, no other method is dependable as a preservative. For example, the microorganism Clostridium botulinum (which causes botulism) can only be eliminated at temperatures above the boiling point. Preservation techniques are needed to prevent fish spoilage and lengthen shelf life. They are designed to inhibit the activity of spoilage bacteria and the metabolic changes leading to a loss of fish quality. Spoilage bacteria are the specific bacteria that produce the unpleasant odours and flavours associated with spoiled fish.Huss HH (1988) Quality and quality changes in fresh fish FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 348, Rome. .FAO: Preservation techniques Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2011. Background The \\"father of canning\\" is the Frenchman Nicolas Appert. In 1795, he began experimenting with ways to preserve fish in jars. He placed jars of fish in boiling water. During the first years of the Napoleonic Wars, the French government offered a 12,000 franc prize to anyone who could devise a cheap and effective method of preserving large amounts of food. The larger armies of the period required increased and regular supplies of quality food. Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. The reason for lack of spoilage was unknown at the time, since it would be another 50 years before Louis Pasteur demonstrated the role of microbes in food spoilage. However, glass containers presented challenges for transportation. Shortly after, the British inventor and merchant Peter Durand patented his own method, this time in a tin can, creating the modern-day process of canning foods.Klooster, John W (2009) Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates p. 103, ABC-CLIO. . Canning was used in the 1830s in Scotland to keep fish fresh until it could be marketed. By the 1840s, salmon was being canned in Maine and New Brunswick.Newell, 1990, p. 4. The commercial salmon canneries had their origins in California, and in the northwest of the US, particularly on the Columbia River. They were never significant on the U.S. Atlantic coast. By the 1940s, the principal canneries had shifted to Alaska.Jarvis ND (1988) Curing and Canning of Fishery Products: A History Marine Fisheries Review, 50 (4): 180‚Äì185. Salmon The first industrial-scale fish cannery, a salmon cannery established in 1864 on a barge in the Sacramento River in California A salmon cannery is a factory that commercially cans salmon. It is a fish processing industry that pioneered the practice of canning fish in general. It became established on the Pacific coast of North America during the nineteenth century, and subsequently expanded to other parts of the world that had easy access to salmon. Prior to canning, fish were salted to preserve them. Cobb says that at the start of the 19th century, the Russians marketed salted salmon caught in Alaska in St. Petersburg.Cobb JN (1917) Pacific salmon fisheries. Government Printing Office, Bur. Fish., Doc 1092. 297 pages. Shortly after, the Northwest Fur Company started marketing salted salmon from the Columbia River. It then merged with the Hudson's Bay Company, and the salmon was marketed in Australia, China, Hawaii, Japan and the eastern United States. Later, some salmon salteries were converted to salmon canneries. The first industrial scale salmon cannery in North America was established in 1864 on a barge in the Sacramento River by the four Hume brothers together with their partner Andrew S. Hapgood.Columbia River History: Canneries Northwest Power and Conservation Council. Retrieved 19 March 2012. In 1866 the Hume brothers relocated the business to a site 50 miles inland on the Columbia River. The history of North American salmon canneries is exemplified by their history on the Columbia River. Within a few years each of the Hume brothers had his own cannery. By 1872, Robert Hume was operating a number of canneries, bringing in Chinese willing to work for low wages to do the cannery work, and having local Native Americans do the fishing. By 1883, salmon canneries had become the major industry on the Columbia River, with 1,700 gillnet boats supplying 39 canneries with 15,000 tonnes of salmon annually, mainly Chinook. Sardines Sardines (or pilchards) are canned in many different ways. At the cannery, the fish are washed, their heads are removed, and the fish are cooked, either by deep-frying or by steam-cooking, after which they are dried. They are then packed in either olive, sunflower or soybean oil, water, or in a tomato, chilli or mustard sauce. Canned sardines in supermarkets may actually be sprat (such as the ‚Äúbrisling sardine‚Äù) or round herrings. Fish sizes vary by species. Good quality sardines should have the head and gills removed before packing. They may also be eviscerated before packing (typically the larger varieties). If not, they should be purged of undigested or partially digested food or feces by holding the live fish in a tank long enough for them to empty their digestive systems. Sardines are typically tightly packed in a small can which is scored for easy opening, either with a pull tab (similar to how a beverage can is opened), or a key, attached to the underside of the can. Thus, it has the virtues of being an easily portable, nonperishable, self-contained food. The close packing of sardines in the can has led to their metaphorical use of the name (\\"packed like sardines\\") in describing any situation where people or objects are crowded together, for instance, in a bus or subway car. \\"Sardines\\" has also been used as the name of a children's game, where one person hides and each successive person who finds the hidden one packs into the same space until there is only one left out, who becomes the next one to hide. Tuna Canned tuna for sale at a alt=Photo of grocery shelves Tuna is canned in edible vegetable oils, in brine, in water, or in various sauces. In the United States, canned tuna is sometimes called tuna fish and only albacore can legally be sold in canned form as \\"white meat tuna\\";Ellis, Richard. Tuna: A Love Story. New York: Random House, 2009, p. 119. in other countries, yellowfin is also acceptable. While in the early 1980s, canned tuna in Australia was most likely southern bluefin; it was usually yellowfin, skipjack, or tongol (labelled \\"northern bluefin\\").Choice: Jan/Feb 2004. Tunas are often caught far from where they are processed for canning, so poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage. Tuna is typically gutted by hand and later precooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours. The fish are then cleaned and filleted, canned (and sealed), with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for pet food (cat or dog). The sealed can itself is then heated (called \\"retort cooking\\") for 2‚Äì4 hours. The retort cooking process kills any bacteria but retains the histamine that can produce rancid flavors. The international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram. An Australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level, although some had \\"off\\" flavors. The level of omega-3 oils found in canned tuna can be highly variable, since some common manufacturing methods destroy omega-3 oils.Is canned tuna a good source of omega 3 fats? WHFoods. Retrieved 22 September 2012. Australian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna meat, but these regulations were dropped in 2003.Choice, August 2003. The remaining weight is usually oil or water. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the amount of tuna in a can. (see part (c)) In 2008, some tuna cans dropped from to due to \\"higher tuna costs\\".

The rest of the Bible has secondary importance. Sources are lacking on whether the Book of Lamentations is excluded from the canon, or whether it forms part of the Book of Jeremiah as it does in the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon. Also in the canon are: Sirach, Judith, Esdras 1 and 2, Meqabyan, Jubilees, Baruch 1 and 4, Tobit, Enoch and the testaments of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; most of these are also found among the Deuterocanonical books or the Biblical apocrypha.

Permitted and forbidden animals and their signs appear on Leviticus 11:3‚Äì8 and Deuteronomy 14:4‚Äì8. Forbidden birds are listed on Leviticus 11:13‚Äì23 and Deuteronomy 14:12‚Äì20.

Birds of prey are forbidden according to Leviticus 11:13‚Äì19. Gid hanasheh is forbidden per Genesis 32:33. Mixtures of milk and meat are not prepared or eaten but are not banned either: Haymanot interpreted the verses Exodus 23:19, Exodus 34:26 and Deuteronomy 14:21 literally \\"shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk\\" (like the Karaites). Nowadays, under Rabbinic influence, mixing dairy products with meat is banned. Ethiopian Jews were forbidden to eat the food of non-Jews. A Kes only eats meat he has slaughtered himself, which his hosts then prepare both for him and themselves. Beta Israel who broke these taboos were ostracized and had to undergo a purification process. Purification included fasting for one or more days, eating only uncooked chickpeas provided by the Kes, and ritual purification before entering the village. Unlike other Ethiopians, the Beta Israel do not eat raw meat dishes like kitfo or gored gored.Shelemay, Music, page 42 Calendar and holidays The Beta Israel calendar is a lunar calendar of 12 months, each 29 or 30 days alternately. Every four years there has been a leap year which added a full month (30 days). The calendar is a combination of the ancient calendar of Alexandria Jewry, Book of Jubilees, Book of Enoch, Abu Shaker and the Ge'ez calendar.Quirun, 1992, p. 71 The years are counted according to the Counting of Kushta \\"1571 to Jesus Christ, 7071 to the Gyptians and 6642 to the Hebrews\\",Ae≈°coly, Book of the Falashas, p. 56 according to this counting the year 5771 () in the Rabbinical Hebrew calendar is the year 7082 in this calendar.

It currently consists of David Bayu Danangjaya (vocals), Fajar Endra Taruna Mangkudisastro (guitar & backing vocals), Franki Indrasmoro Sumbodo (drums), and Mohammad Amil Hussein (bass & backing vocals). They are known for their retro sound and style. Two of their songs, \\"Mobil Balap\\" (\\"Racecar\\") and \\"Posesif\\" (\\"Possessive\\"), were listed by Rolling Stone Indonesia in its 2009 list of the best Indonesian songs of all time. History Naif was formed by Franki Indrasmoro Sumbodo (Pepeng; drums), David Bayu Danangjaya (David; vocals), Fajar Endra Taruna Mangkudisastro (Jarwo; guitar), and Shendy (keyboard) ‚Äì all students of the Jakarta Art Institute () ‚Äì in 1995, when the young men gathered at Shendy's house to work on an assignment. Inspired by a televised Nirvana concert, they wrote their first song, \\"Jauh\\" (\\"Far\\"). Shendy was soon replaced by Chandra Sukardi (Chandra), while Mohammad Amil Hussein (Emil; bass) joined some time later. They began to play on campus and visit several recording studios. After a friend suggested that their music was simple yet harmonic, the group took up the name Naif; it had the added benefit of being easy to remember. After hearing that Indo Semar Sakti, a label of Bulletin Records, was preparing a compilation album, Naif sent a demo cassette to the company. This demo, consisting of \\"Picnic '72'\\", \\"Benci Libur\\" (\\"Hate the Holidays\\"), and \\"Just B\\", was at first refused. However, with the inclusion of the more upbeat \\"Mobil Balap\\" (\\"Racecar\\"), the group were accepted and booked for a self- titled album; their sound was deemed unsuitable to the compilation album. This debut album, released in 1998, spawned several singles, including \\"Mobil Balap\\" (\\"Racecar\\"). However, it was a commercial failure, selling only 20,000 copies; it had been released in the middle of a recession. Two years later, Naif released the album Jangan Terlalu Naif (Don't Be Too Naive); it sold 500,000 copies. In 2002 they released Titik Cerah (A Point of Clarity). Chandra left the band few days before Naif band held their 8th years anniversary \\"Sewindu Naif\\" in 2003 to pursue a career in graphic design, which he had majored in. The following year the band collaborated with senior singer Chrisye on the song \\"Tjah Ayoe\\" (\\"Beautiful Face\\"), for the latter's 2004 album Senyawa (One Soul). The members wrote the song together, while David sang a duet with Chrisye. Naif released a comic and children's music album in 2008 as the animated band BonBinBen (short for ; or Zoo Band). This featured the band members as anthropomorphic animals, based on their nicknames for each other: David became a gorilla named Si Gori, Emil became a wolf named Si Gala, Jarwo became a pony named Si Kupon and Pepeng became a monkey named Si Dungde. The band described BonBinBen as a separate band than Naif. The debut album for BonBinBen, entitled Di Rimba Hijau Kemilau (In the Shining Green Jungle) included eight songs. In 2009 Naif covered several songs for the soundtrack to Ruma Maida (Maida's House), including songs from the 1940s such as \\"Juwita Malam\\" (\\"Beauty of the Night\\", by Ismail Marzuki), \\"Di Bawah Sinar Bulan Purnama\\" (\\"Under the Light of the Full Moon\\"; by R. Maladi) and \\"Ibu Pertiwi\\" (\\"Motherland\\"). The covers were recorded over a period of five days. Naif established their own indie label, Electrified Records, in 2009; they found work with major labels to be overly restrictive. Around that time the members began working on their own side-projects. Jarwo released a solo instrumental album entitled Mr. J. - 1st Journey, then David created a sneaker design for Cosmic clothing; the vocalist later released a solo album entitled DVD Boy. The following year, Pepeng released a series of five comics detailing a fictionalised version of the band's formation and development. Style Hera Diani, writing in The Jakarta Post, describes the band as having a sound reminiscent of music from the 1960s and 1970s. She describes them as having a tacky style of fashion, and David as having a \\"hilarious stage act\\" involving off-key dancing and jumping. Legacy In 2009, Rolling Stone Indonesia listed two of Naif's songs in their list of the best Indonesian songs of all time. \\"Mobil Balap\\" placed at 55 and was described as Naif's most popular song at concerts. The song \\"Posesif\\" (\\"Possessive\\"), which placed at number 96, was described as one of their most recognisable songs.

It was commenced in April 1896 and finished on 29 June,Michael Steinberg, The Concerto: A Listener's GuideClassical Archives and was written while Chausson was holidaying in Florence, Italy.Philadelphia Orchestra He wrote three different versions of Po√®me: with orchestra; with piano accompaniment (later rewritten by other hands); and a recently discovered version for violin, string quartet and piano, a companion to his Concert in D for piano, violin and string quartet, Op. 21 (1892). The solo violin parts of these versions are identical except for one minor detail. The work is notionally in the key of E-flat, and lasts about 16 minutes. It was dedicated to Ysa√øe, who gave its early performances. Genesis of the title Chausson initially called it Le Chant de l'amour triomphant, then changed it to Po√®me symphonique, and finally to simply Po√®me. The first two rejected titles are crossed out on the extant manuscripts. The original title came from the 1881 romantic novella The Song of Love Triumphant (Le Chant de l'amour triomphant; –ü–µ—Å–Ω—å —Ç–æ—Ä–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–µ–π –ª—é–±–≤–∏) by the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, who lived on the estate of the famed mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot and her husband near Paris; all three were acquaintances of Chausson's. The Viardots' daughter Marianne was engaged for some time to Gabriel Faur√©, but broke it off and instead married Alphonse Duvernoy. Turgenev's novella seems to mirror this set of relationships, and it may be that Chausson initially attempted to portray it in music. However, it is clear his final intention was to create a work without extra-musical associations. Early performances In the autumn of 1896, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, Ernest Chausson and their wives were holidaying at Sitges on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. At a party hosted by the Catalan painter Santiago Rusi√±ol,Colorado Public Radio Ysa√øe and Chausson's wife on piano gave an impromptu sight-read performance of Po√®me; local townspeople who overheard it demanded it be encored three times.Sanjuan Symphony Orchestra Present at the party were Enrique Granados and possibly Isaac Alb√©niz. Po√®me's formal premiere was at the Nancy Conservatoire on 27 December 1896, conducted by Guy Ropartz, with Ysa√øe as soloist. But it was not really noticed until Ysa√øe gave the Paris premiere, at a Colonne Concert on 4 April 1897.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol II, p.191, Chausson, Ernest (Am√©d√©e) Chausson was overcome by the sustained applause, something he had not experienced in his career to that point. Ysa√øe also gave the first London performance of Po√®me, a week after Chausson's untimely death in 1899.Diablo Symphony Orchestra Publication Po√®me was published in May 1897, but not at Chausson's own instigation. His friend Isaac Alb√©niz submitted the score to Breitkopf & H√§rtel while he was in Leipzig on a concert tour. They were reluctant to publish the work, considering it \\"vague and bizarre\\" and of \\"extraordinary difficulty\\", and consequently would have \\"few adherents\\" (letter to Alb√©niz of 27 April 1897). They agreed to publish only when Alb√©niz undertook to pay for the costs of publication himself. He also gave Breitkopf 300 marks, which they were to send Chausson under the pretence of a royalty. Chausson never knew of Alb√©niz‚Äôs role in this episode, which was done solely to boost his confidence in his compositional skills (he did not need the money, as he had financial security through wealth inherited from his father).Walter Aaron Clark, Isaac Alb√©niz: Portrait of a Romantic It was also a way for Alb√©niz to repay Chausson's support and encouragement of him when he was a struggling student in Paris.music festival.com Orchestration The orchestration of Po√®me is solo violin, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, harp and strings.IMSLP Structure The work starts Lento e misterioso. Subsequent tempo indications are Molto animato, Animato, Poco lento, Poco meno lento, Allegro, Tempo I and the work ends Tranquillo. It does not follow any formal model but is rhapsodic and moody, with rising and falling tensions and an advanced harmonic style. It strongly reflects the melancholy and introspection with which Chausson was imbued from an early age. (He once wrote to his godmother about his childhood: \\"I was sad without knowing why, but firmly convinced that I had the best reason in the world for it\\".) Joseph Szigeti always believed \\"the typically Ysa√øean sinuous double-stop passages\\" in the exposition could not have been written without the inspiration - or, indeed, the direct involvement - of Ysa√øe himself. This was later confirmed by Ysa√øe, who acknowledged he wrote the double-stopping \\"over Chausson's framework\\".Michael Steinberg, The Concerto: A Listener‚Äôs Guide Recordings Violinists who have recorded Po√®me include Joshua Bell, Nicola Benedetti, Kyung-wha Chung, James Ehnes, George Enescu, Christian Ferras, Julia Fischer, Zino Francescatti, Erick Friedman, Ivry Gitlis, Itamar Golan, Philippe Graffin (both the orchestral and piano accompaniment versions), Arthur Grumiaux, Ida Haendel, Jascha Heifetz, Leila Josefowicz, Chantal Juillet, Nigel Kennedy, Rudolf Koelman, Leonid Kogan, Fritz Kreisler, Gidon Kremer, Jack Liebeck, Yehudi Menuhin, Nathan Milstein, Lydia Mordkovitch, Ginette Neveu, David Oistrakh, Itzhak Perlman, Vadim Repin, Aaron Rosand, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Vladimir Spivakov, Akiko Suwanai and Jacques Thibaud.

Known internally as the RC62, the Integra was originally unveiled as the New Mid Concept in 2010, before being presented in production form at EICMA 2011 in Milan. The Integra shares a platform with two motorcycle variants, the NC700S (RC61) and the NC700X (RC63). All three variants are powered by a 670 cc engine derived from the unit used in the Honda Fit automobile. The Integra will be available with two different power outputs, one version develops a peak power output of at 6,250 rpm and of torque at 4,750 rpm, while the other has a lower output of and to meet 2013 A2 European licensing regulations. The Integra features motorcycle style high-pressure die-cast aluminum alloy wheels and has only of under-seat storage, as the fuel tank is also located under the saddle. Power is delivered through a six-speed dual-clutch transmission with one manual and two automatic drive modes, while combined ABS brakes provide stopping power. German magazine Scooter und Sport tested the Integra and reported a time of 5.6 seconds on the way to a measured top speed of ( indicated). The Integra was updated for the 2014 model year with engine capacity increased to 745cc. Engine The Integra is powered by a single overhead camshaft parallel-twin engine that is essentially the 1.3 L Honda Fit engine chopped in half -- it even retains the same bore and stroke dimensions -- tilted 62¬∞ forward to provide a low centre of gravity, with near uniform weight distribution. The undersquare engine has programmed fuel injection, separate timing profiles for each cylinder, and is tuned to deliver powerful torque in the low- to mid-speed range. The engine was designed to deliver a \\"pleasant throbbing feel\\" of a V-twin through the use of a 270¬∞ crankshaft, which Honda \\"deliberately designed with a uniaxial primary balancer\\" even though the primary vibration of the crankshaft could have been balanced perfectly using a biaxial balance shaft. The fuel consumption figure of has been attributed to the low number of moving parts in the engine: The oil pump is driven by the balance shaft, while the camshaft also drives the water pump. The design also resulted in water hoses that are 30% shorter. The pistons are resin-coated and lightweight aluminum material is used for the friction-reducing roller rocker arm. Transmission The Integra comes standard with a second generation of the six-speed dual-clutch transmission first used on the Honda VFR1200F. The version used on the Integra is lighter and more compact due to a simplified hydraulic circuit; a learning function has also been added to each of the drive modes to detect a variety of riding environments. The system uses heavy duty large-diameter clutches to deal with the rigours of use in stop/start city traffic. \\"Drive\\" mode on the transmission generally selects a high gear ratio, keeping engine speeds between 2,000 and 2,500 rpm, while selecting \\"Sport\\" keeps the engine running at a higher speed for more power on the open road. Marketing The Integra is sold as a scooter in many marketsHonda Australia (urban scooter)Honda Germany (Roller/scooter)Honda UK (scooter) but as a touring motorcycle in some. For example, it appears in the 2012 Honda Netherlands \\"touring\\" brochure alongside well known tourers like the Goldwing 1800. Reviewers have noted the model as a hybrid of scooter (or maxi-scooter) and motorcycle. Guy Procter from Motor Cycle News referred to the Integra as a ‚Äúsuper-scooter‚Äù, but wrote that it might be ‚Äúbetter understood as the conclusive bridge-builder between mainstream commuting and motorcycling‚Äù, noting that it appealed to riders of both motorcycles and scooters, as well as switchers from cars, something that a previous hybrid, the Honda DN-01 had failed to do. 2014 update The NC series was updated for the 2014 model year with an increase in engine capacity to 745 cc (through a 4 mm increase in bore), with power rising to 40.3 kW at 6,250 rpm and torque to 68 Nm at 4,750 rpm. The NC750 Integra also received a new aluminum swing arm, which superseded the box section steel arm of the NC700 Integra . The increased performance was also matched with a software update to the dual clutch transmission and taller gearing that provide improvement to fuel economy. Minor changes to the fairing and seat also provide increased leg room for taller riders.

The Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), has taken over from President Hosni Mubarak a year ago, and was said to transfer power to a civilian administration. Started in the late 2011, the campaign was launched by a group of young people in Egypt to circulate information about the military‚Äôs ‚Äúlies.‚Äù They used grassroots media tools, such as screening of videos, marches, and social media to make citizens aware of the criminal activity committed by the military. The Kazeboon campaign consists of film screenings held in public spaces, characteristically done by projecting video clips against building walls. The video clips depict actions taken by Egyptian military personnel against civilians since SCAF took power in February 2011 following Hosni Mubarak's resignation in an effort to counter the narrative portrayed by state media. The goal of Kazeboon is to ‚Äúremove the military from power‚Äù and ‚Äúget Tahrir Square out of Tahrir Square and into every neighbourhood.\\" Because the Kazeboon campaign has no dedicated coordinators or organizational hierarchy, it is hard to calculate how many screenings have taken place. According to the estimation of some Egyptian activists, dozens of Kazeboon screenings happen across the country every day. Origins The Kazeboon movement started as a response to an incident that occurred on December 17, 2011 in Cairo. A young woman was attacked and dragged along the ground by Egyptian army soldiers, exposing her torso and bra. A picture of the attack appeared the next day on the front page of Tahrir newspaper, accompanied by the word \\"liars.\\" The image was widely shared and became an important visual symbol of abuse of power by the Egyptian military, galvanizing activists that would constitute the organizers of the Kazeboon campaign. To educate the public about this crime and others like it committed by Egyptian police, a film collective known as ‚ÄúMosireen,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Insistent,‚Äù collected hours of film and archived protest footage that they uploaded as videos to YouTube and distributed as DVDs to be played at Kazeboon screenings. The collective first started showing footage of protests on big screens in Tahrir Square in July 2011. The campaign is also known as Askar Kazeboon, which translates to \\"the military are liars\\" or \\"the generals are liars.\\" The target audience of Kazeboon is not protesters and other activists, but people who outside of Egypt and those who support the government and state-run media. The campaign hopes \\"to reach the people who don't know, and are getting their information from SCAF-controlled state media.\\" Screenings =2011= Kazeboon screenings began on December 29, 2011, taking place in public squares in El Mansheya, Alexandria and the Cairo districts of Zamalek, Maadi, Nasr City and Giza. Activists in El Mansheya and Zamalek met resistance from SCAF supporters and security forces. The screenings continued the following day in Cairo's Sayeda Zeinab district. =2012= The campaign quickly began to spread around Egypt in early January 2012, as rallies gained momentum in Dokki, Al-Matariyyah, Shubra and other districts within the first week of the new year, occasionally resulting in clashes with Mubarak supporters. On January 5, 2012, a screening held at Saad Zaghloul Square in Alexandria was preceded by a seminar where prominent activists provided context and shared personal accounts. In the following weeks, the Kazeboon screenings continued around Egypt in anticipation of the anniversary of the January 25th protests in Tahrir Square. On January 26 and 27, 2012, activists projected Kazeboon videos on the facade of the state media headquarters in the Maspero television building to protest for media reform. 2013 Kazeboon in the name of religion (which refers to the Muslim Brotherhood, Salfist groups and any other political groups use region to reach their goals) now has been launched, and her is a Media Release. (Arabic version - English version) Complaints The Kazeboon receives not only applause, but also complaints as well. Several screenings have been broken up with violence after locals objected to activists arriving on their doorsteps. According to an authorized news, In the upmarket Cairo district of Zamalek, which sits on an island in the middle of the Nile, organisers were accused of trying to \\"bring bloody Tahrir to our peaceful island.\\" References External links * Kazeboon official YouTube Channel * Kazeboon official Facebook Page * Kazeboon Twitter official Account Category:Egyptian Crisis (2011‚Äì2014) ","title":"Kazeboon"},{"id":"35824382","title":"V.

The debate between Euthyphro and Socrates therein influenced generations of theologians and gave rise to the question of the relationship between God and morality known as the Euthyphro dilemma. Life Stephanus edition of Plato's Euthyphro, the dialogue for which the ancient prophet is best remembered. Euthyphro's biography can be reconstructed only through the details revealed by Plato in the Euthyphro and Cratylus, as no further contemporaneous sources exist.Debra Nails, The people of Plato: a prosopography of Plato and other Socratics. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002; pg. 152. While the dramatic date of the former may be definitively set at 399 BCE, the latter is uncertain, argued alternately as 422 and 399;John Sallis, Being and Logos, University of Indiana Press, 1997; pg. 230. this makes gauging Euthyphro's period of activity difficult, but the former dating paradigm suggests that he may have been a long-lived figure in Athens. He was an Athenian citizen of the Prospalta deme old enough to have appeared multiple times before the Athenian assembly in 399, placing his birth somewhere in the mid-5th century. Euthyphro had evidently farmed on Naxos,Plato, Euthyphro, 4c probably as part of the cleruchy established by Pericles in 447 to which his father may have belonged. If in fact historical, the trial he instigated against his father depicted in the Euthyphro may have begun as early as 404.John Burnet, Plato's Euthyphro, Apology and Crito. Oxford: Clarendon, 1924 Euthyphro's status as a \\"mantic\\" seer is supported by both texts. Although Socrates seems to treat this faculty with ironic disdain, he never criticizes it openly. Both dialogues attest to Euthyphro's particular interest in father- gods such as Uranus, Cronus and Zeus,Plato, Cratylus, 396bPlato, Euthyphro, 5e and Socrates accredits Euthyphro with igniting deep inspiration during the etymological exercise he embarks upon in the Cratylus. Legacy While little remains of Euthyphro's life, his depiction in Plato sparked interest in many generations of scholars and commentators. Diogenes La√´rtius depicts him as being swayed away from the prosecution of his father following the aporia demonstrated in his eponymous dialogue.Diogenes La√´rtius, 2.29 Inspired by this aporia, the Euthyphro dilemma arose within antiquity and was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries,Terence Irwin, \\"Socrates and Euthyphro: The Argument and its Revival\\" (2006) remaining relevant in theological and philosophical discussions for centuries thereafter.

It was approved in 2014 in adult patients with chronic, non- cancer pain. Doses of 25 mg were found safe and well tolerated for 52 weeks. When given concomitantly with opioid analgesics, naloxegol reduced constipation-related side effects, while maintaining comparable levels of analgesia. The most common side effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting and headache. As a pure opioid antagonist Naloxegol has no potential for abuse. Naloxegol was previously a Schedule II drug in the United States because of its chemical similarity to opium alkaloids. It was officially decontrolled on 23 January 2015. It was reclassified as a prescription drug after the FDA concluded that the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier to this compound made it non-habit-forming, and so without the potential for abuse.  Medical use  Naloxegol is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non- cancer pain. It is recommended that any maintenance laxative be discontinued before starting naloxegol or be held for at-least 3 days. Naloxegol should be taken on an empty stomach at least two hours after the last meal.  Pharmacodynamic properties  Naloxegol inhibits opioid binding in Œº-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, thus decreasing the constipating effects (slowing of gastrointestinal motility and transit, hypertonicity, increased fluid reabsorption) associated with opioids. If naloxegol is coadministered with other opioid antagonists, there is a potential for additive effect and increased risk of opioid withdrawal.  Mechanism of action  Chemically, naloxegol is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol-modified) derivative of Œ±-naloxol. Specifically, the 6-Œ±-hydroxyl group of Œ±-naloxol is connected via an ether linkage to the free hydroxyl group of a monomethoxy- terminated n=7 oligomer of PEG, shown extending at the lower left of the molecule image at right. The \\"n=7\\" defines the number of two-carbon ethylenes, and so the chain length, of the attached PEG chain, and the \\"monomethoxy\\" indicates that the terminal hydroxyl group of the PEG is \\"capped\\" with a methyl group.Technically, the molecule that is attached via the ether link is O-methyl-heptaethylene glycol [that is, methoxyheptaethylene glycol, CH3OCH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)5CH2CH2OH], molecular weight 340.4, CAS number 4437-01-8. See The pegylation of the 6-Œ±-hydroxyl side chain of naloxol prevents the drug from crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). As such, it can be considered the antithesis of the peripherally-acting opiate loperamide which is utilized as an opiate-targeting anti-diarrheal agent that does not cause traditional opiate side-effects due to its inability to accumulate in the central nervous system in normal subjects.

It was raised in 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force for service during World War I and formed part of the 6th Brigade, attached to the 2nd Division. It fought during the Gallipoli campaign and on the Western Front before being disbanded in 1919. In 1921, it was re-raised as a part-time unit and was merged with the 29th Battalion in 1930 to form the \\"29th/22nd Infantry Battalion\\". Split in August 1939 and known as the \\"22nd Battalion (South Gippsland Regiment)\\", the battalion saw action against the Japanese during World War II in the Huon Peninsula and New Britain campaigns. The battalion was disbanded in June 1946. It was re-established as part of the Royal Victoria Regiment in the mid-1960s as a remote area battalion within the Citizens Military Force, and later became a part of the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. History =World War I= The 22nd Battalion was raised at Broadmeadows Camp in Victoria, on 26 March 1915, as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the all-volunteer force raised for service during World War I. The battalion was assigned to the 6th Brigade, which formed part of the 2nd Division. After completing rudimentary training, the main part of the battalion left Australia on 8 May 1915, sailing for Egypt where they were to complete their training. In September 1915, the 2nd Division was despatched to the Gallipoli Peninsula as reinforcements, and after this the battalion saw their first action after relieving elements of the 2nd Brigade holding positions north of Anzac Cove, allowing them to be withdrawn for rest. The 22nd remained at Gallipoli until the final evacuation took place in December 1915, primarily undertaking defensive duties. During their involvement in the campaign, the battalion's transport drivers were reposted to Salonika to provide support for the Serbian contingent, along with drivers from other units within the 6th Brigade. They returned to the battalion after the final evacuation of Gallipoli. After being withdrawn back to Egypt, the battalion was strengthened by reinforcements from Australia as the AIF's infantry divisions were reorganised and expanded before being sent to France to take part in the fighting on the Western Front. William Ruthven, the 22nd Battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient Embarking in March 1916, after landing in France the 22nd Battalion entered the front line around Fleurbaix in April. Its first major action came a few months later during the Battle of Pozi√®res, which was part of the wider Battle of the Somme. The battle proved a very costly introduction to the Western Front for the 22nd Battalion, with their losses between 25 July and 7 August 1916 totalling 27 officers and 656 other ranks killed or wounded. After this, the battalion spent the next two-and-a-half years rotating through the trenches in France and Belgium. In early 1917, the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, after which the 22nd Battalion took part in a number of actions including the Battle of Bullecourt and the Battle of Broodseinde. In early 1918, the Germans launched a large-scale offensive ‚Äì the Spring Offensive ‚Äì following the collapse of Russia on the Eastern Front. Throughout March and April, the 22nd Battalion undertook defensive duties as the German offensive was blunted, before the Allies launched their own offensive around Amiens in August. After this, the 22nd Battalion took part in a number of battles including the Battle of Mont St Quentin and the Battle of Montbrehain. The fighting around Montbrehain, which took place on 5 October 1918, was the final action fought by Australian infantrymen on the Western Front during the war, and came as part of a series of attacks made by the Allies to breach the Hindenburg Line following the launch of the Hundred Days Offensive. Following the successful attack, the 22nd Battalion moved to Abbeville where, along with the rest of the Australian Corps, they were withdrawn for rest and reorganisation due to heavy casualties. In November 1918, an armistice came into effect, ending the war before the battalion could return to the front. After this, the AIF was slowly returned to Australia and the battalion's personnel were demobilised. By May 1919, the battalion ceased to exist. During the war, one member of the battalion received the Victoria Cross: Sergeant William Ruthven, who received the award for his actions during an attack on Ville-sur-Ancre on 19 May 1918. (Victoria Cross) According to the Australian War Memorial, the 22nd Battalion's casualties during the war amounted to 854 killed and 2,378 wounded. =Inter-war years, World War II and beyond= In 1921, after the demobilisation of the AIF was completed, Australia's part-time military forces ‚Äì the Citizens Forces ‚Äì was reorganised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF. As a result, the 22nd Battalion was re-raised from previously existing Citizens Forces units, drawing personnel and lineage from the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment as well as elements of the 6th and 29th Infantry Regiments and the 29th Light Horse. In 1927, the battalion adopted the territorial designation of the \\"Richmond Regiment\\", and the motto of Extendere Factis. In 1930, an alliance was approved with The Cheshire Regiment. That same year, the 22nd was merged with the 29th Battalion to form the 29th/22nd Infantry Battalion, because of reduced manpower and government funding as a result of the Great Depression. The two units were split in August 1939 as the Australian military was expanded just prior to the outbreak of World War II. At this time, the battalion became known as the \\"22nd Battalion (South Gippsland Regiment)\\", as it was re-established around Leongatha in South Gippsland, Victoria. Early in the war, the 22nd was assigned to the 4th Brigade and undertook garrison duties and training camps in Australia ‚Äì based mainly in Queensland. In early 1943, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea to take part in the fighting against the Japanese serving mainly with the 5th Division, but also briefly as part of the 9th. The battalion initially deployed to the Milne Bay area in March 1943 undertaking garrison duties and jungle training before moving to Lae shortly after its capture by Australian forces in early September. Later in the month, the 9th Division carried out a landing on the Huon Peninsula, and the 22nd Battalion played a support role, advancing towards Finschhafen overland from Lae, while the 9th Division advanced on the town from the north from their lodgement at Scarlet Beach. In order to relieve the 2/13th and 2/15th Infantry Battalions around the beachhead to free them up for the advance west on Lae, the 4th Brigade had landed to the east of Lae on 10/11 September. The 22nd had then began the pursuit of the Japanese that were withdrawing to the east, marching from Hopoi Mission Station to Finschhafen, with a view to placing pressure on the Japanese southern flank. This feat was described by the Kalgoorlie Miner as the \\"greatest march\\" of the New Guinea campaign and in 10 days the battalion covered of rugged terrain. Later, after Sattelberg was captured, they joined the advance along the northern coast of the Huon Peninsula towards Madang. After a total of 16 months overseas, the battalion was withdrawn back to Australia for rest and reorganisation in September 1944. After a period of training around Strathpine, Queensland, the 22nd Battalion was deployed to New Britain in January 1945. After landing at Wunung Bay, the 22nd Battalion undertook patrols around the local area as the Australians undertook a campaign to contain the larger Japanese force to the northern part of the island. The fighting came to an end in August 1945 and after the war, the 22nd Battalion garrisoned Rabaul. It was disbanded on 26 May 1946. During the war, the 22nd Battalion lost 43 men killed in action or died on active service, while a further 72 were wounded. In 1966, following the reintroduction of national service, the 22nd Battalion was re-raised as part of the Royal Victoria Regiment, as a remote area battalion within the Citizens Military Force, offering special conditions of service for those eligible for call up who elected to serve in the CMF rather than the Regular Army, but who could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence. The battalion also included a small detachment of Tasmanians, who had originally been recruited into the 50th Battalion, but who were reallocated when the decision to re-raise that unit was cancelled. With the abolition of national service in late 1972, 22 RVR lost the vast majority of its soldiers. To keep the battalion viable C Company of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (2 RVR), with depots in Shepparton and Echuca, was attached to 22 RVR. 22 RVR was closed on 30 June 1975 and C Company returned to 2 RVR, which subsequently became the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment in 1987.

Few special achievements in Parliament: # This was for the first time that the then Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, while replying to his question, had to accept in Rajya Sabha, that Indian Farmers are victims of Negative Support amounting to 72% of value of agriculture produce. This was done after extensive research work on agriculture costing, subsidisation and other parameters governing the intricate economics of agriculture. # Agriculture Minister Mr. Balram Jakhar, was made to admit on the floor of Rajya Sabha that Farmers cannot freely add value to their produce, not even shell rice from their paddy produce. # Main focus in the Rajya Sabha remained to explore and raise the economic issues if Farmers of the country. In 1995, continuing his struggle, and to highlight the Zonal restriction levied by the Government to suppress the costs of agriculture produces, he led an agitation to press government to allow free movement of wheat. He being a Sitting Member of Rajya Sabha was arrested along with hundreds of farmers while breaking un-announced restrictions on movement of wheat. He was a member of delegation of Indian Members of Parliament to UN in 1995. Later activities In 1997, he led a march to Wagha Border, along with Sh. Sharad Joshi and thousands of farmers from Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab, as a symbolic gesture to impress for free trade route through Pakistan. In 1998, there was a spate of suicides by farmers in Punjab due to rising debt. Alarmed, he led thousands of farmers to pray and pledge before Shri Akal Takhat Sahib, Amritsar, not to commit suicides, but to fight against anti-farmer policies, on 15 August 1998. An agitation was launched in 2000 against procurement of Paddy at prices even lower than Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the Government of India. During 2001, there was an ongoing debate on the benefits of WTO. Many people were raising doubts on the opening of the Indian economy. He organised a talk on WTO by Sh. Sharad Joshi and other renowned scholars at Chandigarh, to highlight the rights of farmers to be liberated from the unconstitutional and inhuman economic blockade. Thousands of farmers attended and got educated on the true picture. In 2002, under his leadership, the BKU in Punjab supported Congress to power in Punjab. In 2003 he led a successful Agitation against the Punjab Government (Congress which his party had supported to Power) to get the arrears of sugarcane, by organising a massive Dharna, at National Highway at Dina Nagar, Gurdaspur district, and afterwards Gheraoing DC Gurdaspur Office Complex for continuous 16 days. This resulted in release of all the arrears of 800 million rupees. He participated in Global Forum on Agricultural Research at Dakar, Senegal. May 2003. He was re-elected Chairman of the KCC for three years in 2003. He led a massive Kisan rally in front of Parliament of India in New Delhi highlighting lower than cost of production procurement prices of food grains, paddy, wheat and sugar cane and payment of arrears of sugar cane in 2003. The Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh also sat in the agitation along with the farmers. In 2004, he organised a seminar on the significance and importance of the River Water issues. Capt Amarinder Singh, CM Punjab was honoured for taking a bold step on protecting the rights of Punjab in this regard. In 2005, he was invited to attend the World Agriculture Forum meet at St. Louis, USA from 16‚Äì18 May 2005 on the issue \\"The key to Peace, Security and Growth- Local Regional and Global Agri Food System\\". He was nominated as a Member of Sub Committee of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission in 2009. BKU, under his leadership supported Congress in Punjab and Haryana for the Lok Sabha Elections. In 2010, he organised meeting of the Kisan Coordination Committee in September 2010 under his Chairmanship in which one of the main issues discussed was regarding land acquisition, which is a burning issue in India at the moment. While discussing the issue of land acquisition, it was stressed that the fact that in India, companies are allowed to purchase thousands of acres of land and earn profits to the tune of crores of rupees whereas on the other hand, land Ceiling Act is implemented against the poor farmers who cannot even sustain themselves on whatever little land they have. This clearly shows the callous attitude of the governments towards the farmers. That the Companies, either themselves or through the government, which takes the land from the poor farmers and after acquiring it, gives it to multinational companies at throw away prices who can otherwise also purchase the said land at market price and when it comes to farmers, the land Ceiling Act comes into play. It was also stressed that such a policy should not be made by the Government without consulting the members of the Kisan Coordination Committee and in case the Government went ahead with the draconian laws and policies framed against the farmers, the Kisan Coordination Committee would start its nationwide protest against the Government from its next Convention proposed to be held at Kerala. In 2012, he and his BKU fully supported the Congress party under the command of Capt Amarinder Singh because of his pro farmer approach, clean governance and administrative skills. In 2012, he led a delegation to Sh Rahul Gandhi to request him that Government should start giving payments to the farmers directly instead through the commission agents (direct payment to farmers). Gandhi was convinced and he deputed a team to visit Punjab to carry out a detailed study on this aspect. In 2012, UPA government had opened up FDI in retail. He led a team to thank Smt Sonia Gandhi ji for this farmer friendly step. He presented a badge of BKU to Smt Sonia Gandhi ji for this historic step. In 2013, he gave a detailed memorandum to Sh. Jai Ram Ramesh, the then Rural Development Minister to request him to include small and marginal farmers in the MNREGA. This suggestion was greatly appreciated and this scheme was included in MNREGA as an amendment to the act. In 2014, Sh Rahul Gandhi invited him for suggestions on the Congress Manifesto (2014 polls). He gave very elaborate suggestions to him during a session organised at Ghanaur, Panipat. UPA government had passed a historic Act to protect farmers in land acquisition. But when Modi Government came to power, they wanted to dilute this Act. However, he on behalf of BKU and KCC submitted his strong opposition (2015) to any dilution to this Act before the committee headed by SS. Ahluwalia, MP. In 2014 and 2015 he led a delegation (three times) of BKU to submit memorandum to Punjab Governors (Sh. Shivraj Patel and Prof Kaptan Sinh Solanki) to highlight the plight of Punjab farmers because the then Punjab Government had fully failed in protecting the interests of farmers. In 2016 he led a delegation of BKU to meet the Chief Electoral officer Punjab requesting him to make the election manifesto legally binding document. In 2016/2017 he and his BKU fully supported Capt Amarinder Singh led Congress party. He canvassed for Congress candidates in many constituencies and highlighted the leadership qualities of Capt Amarinder Singh and his pro-farmer work done during his last tenure. In 2017 April he organised a National Level meeting of KCC at Chandigarh. From here he launched a uniqu andolan ‚ÄúJo vada kia vo nibhana padega‚Äù to force Modi Government to fulfil his poll promise of implementing Swaminathan Report.

She established the first UDA women's unit on her native Shankill Road in Belfast. Her two sons Herbie and James \\"Sham\\" Millar are also high-profile UDA members and her daughter's husband is former West Belfast brigadier \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson. UDA women's unit Born into a Protestant family in Belfast, Northern Ireland in about 1944, Millar was raised on the staunchly loyalist Shankill Road. She was one of the founding members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) which was set up in September 1971 as an umbrella organisation for the many local vigilante groups that had sprung up in loyalist areas to protect their communities from attacks by Irish republicans following the outbreak of the violent religious-political conflict known as the Troubles in the late 1960s. She had the nicknames of \\"Bucket\\" on account of her outspoken, loud-mouthed personality, and \\"Queen of the UDA\\" for her devotion to the paramilitary organisation. Described as tough and fearless, she was a heavy smoker and a \\"leading light in UDA circles\\". A street off the lower Shankill Road in the early 1970s Shortly afterwards, Millar established the first UDA women's unit on the Shankill Road. Although there were other women's units set up in other areas, the Shankill Road group was particularly active and highly visible on account of the beehive hairstyles the women typically wore.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.136 In May 1974 during the Ulster Workers' Council strike, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Len Murray went to Belfast to lead the striking shipyard workers on a 'back to work' march. Just as the marchers set out for the Harland and Wolff shipyard, furious members of the Shankill Road women's unit arrived on the scene and proceeded to pelt Murray with flour, eggs and other objects. Glen Barr, the chairman of the strike co-ordinating committee witnessed the assault. In an interview with British journalist Peter Taylor he described the UDA women with their beehives as looking \\"quite frightening\\" and resembled six feet tall Amazons. Barr had had encounters with the women on previous occasions and was intimidated by them. Another group, the Sandy Row women's unit gained notoriety in July 1974 when its commander Elizabeth \\"Lily\\" Douglas ordered her \\"Heavy Squad\\" (a gang within the unit who meted out punishment beatings) to bring Protestant single mother Ann Ogilby to a \\"Romper Room\\" where she was subsequently beaten to death.Simpson, Alan (1999). Murder Madness: True Crimes of The Troubles. Dublin: Gill & McMillan. pp.38‚Äì39 \\"Romper Rooms\\" were locations where UDA victims were brought to be \\"rompered\\" which was a UDA slang term for a torture and beating session prior to \\"execution\\". The name derived from the children's television programme. The brutality of the attack greatly shocked the Protestant community and the UDA leadership which had not sanctioned the killing. Douglas and ten others were imprisoned for Ann Ogilby's murder and the unit was subsequently stood down.Wood, p.59 Jean Moore and later Hester Dunn headed the UDA women's department from the UDA headquarters on Gawn Street, in east Belfast.Dillon, Martin; Lehane, Denis (1973). Political murder in Northern Ireland. Penguin. p.232Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: a History of the UDA. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. p.94 The women's units were typically involved in local community work and responsible for the assembly and delivery of food parcels to UDA prisoners. The latter activity was a source of pride for the UDA.Women Loyalist Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland: Duty, Agency and Empowerment ‚Äì A Report from the Field\\". All Academic Research. Sandra McEvoy. 2008. p.16 As the Northern Ireland conflict continued over the years and decades, Millar remained within the UDA to serve as a loyal and dedicated member. Her sons Herbie (born c.1965) and James \\"Sham\\" Millar (born c.1966) later became high- profile figures inside the organisation, and her daughter married high-ranking member \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson. Johnny Adair and C Company Johnny Adair's house in Boundary Way, during the period when he was West Belfast brigadier Millar, her sons and son-in-law were part of the UDA West Belfast Brigade's C Company 2nd Battalion based on the Shankill Road which in the early 1990s came under the command of Johnny Adair who was made West Belfast brigadier. On 10 August 1992, the UDA was proscribed by the British government. Up until then it had been a legal organisation. Millar became an ardent supporter of Adair and set herself up as resident cook in the \\"Big Brother House\\", a community centre in the lower Shankill which Adair used as his headquarters and where his henchmen brought disobedient locals for punishment beatings. In the early 2000s, however, Millar found herself deeply embroiled in an internal feud within the UDA. On 24 December 2002 as part of the feud, a rival, anti-Adair unit set fire to Millar's caravan home in Groomsport park, burning it to the ground. Millar, who was in Belfast at the time, was devastated by the arson attack as she regarded the caravan as a second home for her and her 63-year- old husband. Describing herself as a \\"community worker in the lower Shankill\\" who worked with \\"the young and old, trying to make life better for them\\", she claimed she knew the identity of the perpetrators calling them \\"the scum of the earth\\". Ulster Democratic Party member and staunch Adair ally John White laid the blame firmly on the North Belfast UDA. She had previously suffered a stroke and told the News Letter how saddened she was to have lost the caravan, \\"I have a lot of memories of the place and the people there. I used to go down to the caravan in March and stay there until around the end of September because I loved it so much\\". Following the incident, Millar turned her Shankill Road home into a fortress in case of further attacks. In early 2003, Adair, who was imprisoned at the time, allegedly gave orders from his prison cell for the elimination of his biggest rival John Gregg, leader of the UDA South East Antrim Brigade. C Company's young military commander Alan McCullough hastened to do Adair's bidding and orchestrated Gregg's killing. The brigadier was shot dead in a taxi near Belfast docks along with Rab Carson after the men had returned from a Rangers F.C. match in Glasgow on 1 February 2003. The killing of Gregg infuriated the UDA Inner Council which had already expelled Adair and his entire C Company unit from the mainstream organisation the previous September.The Inner Council was the UDA leadership made of the brigadiers who represented the six brigade areas. Gregg enjoyed much popularity among the loyalist community for his attempted assassination of Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams in 1984. On the day of Gregg's funeral, carloads of angry UDA men led by South Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald convened on Adair's Boundary Way stronghold in the lower Shankill. McDonald also detested Adair and had been one of the UDA leaders who sanctioned his expulsion. Adair's wife, Gina, John White, and about 20 of his supporters including Millar's sons were compelled to leave Northern Ireland. The rogue group headed for Scotland and afterwards England.McDonald, Henry & Cusack, Jim (2004). UDA: Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror. Penguin Ireland. p.386 =Expulsion from Northern Ireland= Millar believed her years of devotion to the organisation would allow her to remain in her Shankill Road home. Her pleas fell on deaf ears as the UDA Inner Council maintained she was fully aware of her sons' drug-dealing and loan-sharking activities, and that they had stolen over ten thousand pounds of UDA funds. Two weeks after the Adair faction was kicked out of Northern Ireland, Millar was also ordered to leave and told she'd be executed if she failed to comply. She reluctantly joined her sons and the other Adair supporters in Bolton where they became known as the \\"Bolton Wanderers\\". Adair's former friend Mo Courtney had already defected back to the mainstream UDA and was appointed commander of Adair's West Belfast Brigade in lieu of Millar's son-in-law, \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson who had served as brigadier during Adair's imprisonment. He had also fled to England. Millar could not adjust to her new life as an exile in England and felt homesick for Northern Ireland. Defying the UDA leadership, she returned home and immediately applied to the Housing Executive for a house in Bangor, County Down. Once the UDA in Belfast discovered she had disobeyed orders by returning, she was immediately subjected to threats and had the windows of her home smashed with bricks. When English journalists called to her house she loudly announced, \\"I'm staying, no-one will put me out!\\". The next day the Bolton hideout her sons were sharing with Gina Adair, \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson, and Sham's girlfriend was raked with machinegun fire. Nobody was injured in the attack which was carried out by Alan McCullough as a means to ingratiate himself with Mo Courtney and the new C Company leadership to be allowed to return home.cowan \\"Family fears for fate of missing loyalist\\".

Based on the view that music is speech and speech is music, Lessac's work and books focused on body and speech energies and how they go together. Arthur Lessac's textual annotation system, which was originally developed to assist actors, singers, and orators in marking up scripts to prepare for performance, is adapted in LTI's speech synthesis system as the basic representation of the speech to be synthesized (Lessemes), in contrast to many other systems which use a phonetic representation.M.

LTI‚Äôs software has two major components: (1) a linguistic front-end that converts plain text to a sequence of prosodic and phonosensory graphic symbols (Lessemes) based on Arthur Lessac's annotation system, which specify the speech units to be synthesized; (2) a signal- processing back-end that takes the Lessemes as acoustic data and produces human-sounding synthesized speech as output, using unit selection and concatenation.

The village has a population of about 500 and lies southeast of Putbus on the Bay of Greifswald. Lauterbach has a harbour and a connexion, via a branch line, to both the standard gauge railway network and the R√ºgen Light Railway.  History  The first known modern settlement in the area was in 1819 when a paper mill was built between the Goor woods and Neuendorf. Previously, Prince Wilhelm Malte of Putbus had established the first seaside resort on R√ºgen in 1816 on the beach at Neuendorf further to the south. Initially this resort only consisted of tents and bathing machines. In 1817/1818 a permanent bathing house was built in the Goor. In order to enable boats to land, it was decided in 1834 to build a landing stage. The site chosen for this, however, was the calmer bay of the present-day Lauterbach, and not Neuendorf. Between 1833 and 1836 the first settlement appeared here as a result. The first records of this date to 1840. At that time the settlement had 7 houses. Thanks to the construction of the jetty, boats from Sweden and Oderk√§hne and steamships from Stettin and Stralsund docked. Bathing services soon reduced, but boat-building, fishing and trade remained prominent for many years. The name of the village comes from the wife of the Prince of Putbus, whose maiden name was von Lauterbach. In 1890 the railway line from Bergen to Lauterbach was completed. The station building is a listed building. In 1901, construction of the harbour started and it was completed the following year.  Economy  There are various small businesses in Lauterbach running restaurants and accommodation. The harbour is important for the local economy, being also used as a marina. Passenger boats also call at the harbour. An important tourist destination is the island of Vilm, not far from Lauterbach. Boatbuilding and fishing are still carried on.

It comprises four essays addressing Rand's life and writings and her philosophy of Objectivism. The book's title essay is Barbara Branden's authorized biography of Rand. The Brandens subsequently repudiated the book, deeming its approach too uncritical toward Rand. Summary The first section of the book contains three essays by Nathaniel Branden, under the heading \\"An Analysis of the Novels of Ayn Rand\\". The first discusses the ethical philosophy presented in Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged (1957). The second discusses the implications that Objectivism has for the field of psychology. The final essay in this section discusses Rand's literary techniques. The book's second section contains a biographical essay of Rand by Barbara Branden, which was written with Rand's full cooperation and review. Background and publication history At the time the book was written, Nathaniel and Barbara Branden had been close friends with Rand for over a decade. The couple worked through the Nathaniel Branden Institute and The Objectivist Newsletter to spread Rand's philosophical ideas. The book was inspired by a series of radio talks that Nathaniel Branden gave on radio station WBAI in New York. He suggested the idea of basing a book on the talk to Bennett Cerf, Rand's editor at Random House. Cerf suggested including a biographical essay about Rand. Nathaniel Branden turned this portion of the book over to his wife Barbara, who conducted a series of audiotaped private interviews with Rand to collect biographical information. In 1968, several years after the publication of Who Is Ayn Rand?, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens. Subsequently, the Brandens repudiated their own book, saying the approach they took was too uncritical towards Rand. The book was first published in June 1962 in a hardcover edition from Random House. A paperback edition was released in June 1964 by Paperback Library. Reception Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein said Nathaniel Branden's essays are \\"illuminating\\", but the biography is limited because it required Rand's review and approval. Historian Jennifer Burns called it \\"hagiographic\\". In an essay accusing the Objectivist movement of being a cult, Murray N. Rothbard described the book as an \\"authorized exercise in uncritical adulation\\". Other critics of Rand have called it \\"gushingly adulatory\\" and \\"sycophantic\\".

Route description  The line branches off at Bergen auf R√ºgen station from the Stralsund‚ÄìSassnitz railway. It runs southeast, through Putbus to Lauterbach Mole and ends on the shore of the R√ºgischer Bodden. In Putbus there is a junction with the steam-operated, narrow gauge R√ºgen Light Railway to G√∂hren via the Baltic Sea resort of Binz. Standard-gauge trains are diesel railcars. Narrow-gauge trains are hauled from Putbus to Lauterbach Mole by steam; as there is no passing loop there, are hauled back by a diesel engine attached to the rear.  History  Until the opening of the R√ºgen Causeway (R√ºgendamm) in 1935, there was only an isolated railway network on the island of R√ºgen. There were two standard gauge lines, Altef√§hr to Sassnitz and the branch from Bergen to Lauterbach. This branch was opened on 15 August 1889 as far as Putbus and extended to Lauterbach on 15 May 1890. To 1945 there was a siding to the Lauterbach landing stage. In 1998 the terminal halt, Lauterbach Mole, was opened and the station in Lauterbach itself closed. Since 28 May 1999 the section from Putbus to Lauterbach Mole has been dual gauge (750/1435 mm), enabling the narrow gauge trains of the R√ºgen Light Railway (R√ºgenschen B√§derbahn, R√ºBB) as well as standard gauge trains to operate during the summer. Since 9 December 2006, Lauterbach has been opened again as a halt. After the bankruptcy of the Karsdorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft (KEG), who had developed the timetable after 2003/2004, the Ostmecklenburgische Eisenbahn (OME) were given the contract by the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to run local passenger rail services. In February 2004, services were taken over by the OME. From 2005 to December 2009, services were delivered by the Ostseeland-Verkehr (OLA). This was formed by a merger of the Ostmecklenburgischen Eisenbahn (OME) and the Mecklenburg Bahn (MEBA). On the change of timetable in December 2009 the Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsgesellschaft Pressnitztalbahn (PRESS) took over operations on the line for 9 years.Pressemeldung Ministerium f√ºr Verkehr, Bau und Landesentwicklung dated 5 August 2009  Services  Since the timetable change on 13 December 2009, the line has operated two-hourly services (hourly from May to August) by PRESS using a RegioShuttle unit from Stadler.

The Trust was established under the Victorian Conservation Trust Act 1972 to enable people to contribute permanently to nature conservation by donating land or money.Trust For Nature website. Trust for Nature has since evolved into one of Victoria's primary private land conservation organisations. Purpose \\"Victoria's most threatened native plants and wildlife are conserved for future generations.\\" \\"We work collaboratively to protect nature on private land forever.\\" Conservation tools Trust for Nature has developed five key mechanisms to achieve conservation gains on private land: #Conservation covenants: Private landowners protect quality native vegetation on their land by placing a covenant on the title, protecting the land in perpetuity. Trust for Nature developed conservation covenants in 1978 as a tool to protect native plants and wildlife on private land. Conservation covenants are backed by Victorian State legislation through the Victorian Conservation Trust Act 1972 and the Trust currently has more than 1,115 conservation covenants in effect which protects more than 47,000 hectares of private land. The Trust has also purchased and preserved more than 55 properties across Victoria through its Revolving Fund, as well as currently owning and managing 46 properties that cover over 36,000 hectares of Victoria. #Stewardship program: Land management advice and information is provided to landowners who have covenanted their property. #Revolving fund: The Trust purchases land of high vegetation quality and on-sells the property with a covenant attached. Proceeds from the sale go back into the Revolving Fund. #Land acquisition: Trust for Nature acquires land of high conservation value and manages it with the help of volunteers. Trust-owned properties are often used for open days and education purposes, demonstrating land conservation practices. #Markets: The Trust organises native vegetation offset agreements between private landowners and proponents who have an offset requirement. Landowners receive a payment from the proponent to improve native vegetation quality on their land.  Regions  Trust for Nature operates within Victoria's ten catchment areas, often in partnership with the region's Catchment Management Authority (CMA).

As the ninth most populous country and twelfth most densely populated countries in the world, its rising population and limited land space have put tremendous strains on the urban ecosystem. The capital of Dhaka itself underwent severe transformations in recent years to catch up the increased rate of urbanisation. This change was paralleled by a boom in the real estate, construction and housing industry. According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Unified measures have been adopted from the national community in an effort to avoid further man made calamities due to climate change and higher emissions. There are six main sectors most likely to be affected by climate change in Bangladesh ‚Äì water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity, fisheries, and human health. Deforestation has resulted in several man made disasters in the country's history. Green buildings assure efficient usage of water and energy and the nation is struggling in the production of electricity and suffering from a shortage of water. The First Government Green Building Initiative was taken by the Housing and Building Research Institute in 2007 http://www.hbri.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/hbri.portal.gov.bd/page/4af59f2d_c867_4be0_98f3_4c9e6a9dc6e2/2020-02-04-12-53-e6d4972994978c3a5f6b34763df25275.pdfThe Eco-Housing Project designed by Ar. Md Nafizur Rahman. The with the support of IFC-world bank the HBRI Drafted the Guideline for Grenbuilding Code in 2012, in the same year a new chapter on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability was included in BNBC. The Building Energy and Environment Rating System for Bangladesh has been Drafted by Ar. Md. Nafizur Rahmanhttps://www.thedailystar.net/science-arts-construction-materials/energy- efficient-building-materials-144643 in 2018 for the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Authority (SREDA) The Bangladesh Bankhttps://bb.org.bd/openpdf.php with te support of SREDA also created a point-based rating system for their Refinancing scheme in 2017. In the private sector, the first green building in Bangladesh was by EPIC group in May 2011. Since 2008, Sustainable Built Environment Initiative ‚Äì Bangladesh (later Bangladesh Green Building Council) founder, Sanwar Azam had worked to unify the stake holders towards a greener country, saying that with growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanisation to major cities, 'Going green' had become a marketing ploy for various organisations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability. He offered a centralised board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms. In addition, he proposed a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture. Azam also stressed the need for educational programs in sustainable designs and various universities in Bangladesh planned to promote Green Building principles in their curriculum, such as in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, State University of Bangladesh-SUB, North South University, BRAC University and Asia Pacific University. Dr. Saleh Uddin was the Events and Education Committee of Bangladesh Green Building Council. Citing that in cramped environment, such buildings and structures would be far more comfortable and satisfying but most importantly directly address some national issues, like conserving water and energy. The Government of Bangladesh in 2009 stopped giving connections to newly constructed buildings meaning that new homes would not have access to energy, and even water due to shortages. Experts agreed that a rating tool would not only facilitate government incentives to sustainable communities but achieve the six-point goals of the National Water Policy of 1999 by the World Bank as well as the Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 by the Ministry of Power and Energy. In an event with Architecture and construction experts, he urged for a national need for sustainable development in the nation's growing building industry and brought a forum together to act as the national GBC of Bangladesh. He stressed reductions of carbon emissions from buildings. National and international energy companies like Energpac and Siemens attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative. The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the Seventh Target from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as for the first time the council provided support for green building certifications. Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. In another interview with The Independent, Sanwar said \\"there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction,\\" and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. About the feasibility of widespread utilisation of LEED certifications, he said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context. These activities were also promoted by national and region experts. Prominent national award-winning architects such as Mustapha Khalid Palash, the 2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and Rafiq Azam, defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define 'Green' according to the national circumstances. The Institute of Architects Bangladesh, which works with different government organisation to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool. In 2011, BGBC founder pointed out that such green building standards and tools will lead to conservation as buildings would less consumption of electricity and water, and also 'the need for reduction of carbon emissions' in the current building and construction scenario. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh spoke about the government's role.

He specialized in decapod crustaceans and fisheries science. Biography Burkenroad was born in New Orleans in 1910 as the only child of coffee importer David Burkenroad and his artist wife Flora Salinger. His family contained many eccentrics, and Martin was similarly labeled \\"headstrong\\". He entered Tulane University in 1926, but although he published his first papers during that time, his studies ended when he was \\"'encouraged' to leave\\" in 1929. He then began working for the Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory in the Dry Tortugas, before joining the Louisiana Department of Conservation in 1931, where he studied the local shrimp fishery. After brief spells at several museums, he joined Yale University under the guidance of A. E. Parr. Burkenroad spent many productive years at Yale, where the usual time limit for research for a dissertation was permanently waived for him, but he never submitted a dissertation. Burkenroad left Yale in 1945 and was married to Marianne Algunde Schweitzer soon after. He became the chief biologist of the North Carolina Survey of Marine Fisheries, but fell out with his superiors, and so moved to Port Aransas to work at the marine facilities of the University of Texas. This was followed by what Burkenroad considered to be his most meaningful position, as a consultant on shrimp fishery to the governments of Panama and Costa Rica. Following a burst dam, however, Burkenroad's attempts to build a shrimp farm were thwarted. In the 1960s, Burkenroad and his family (his wife and three children) returned to New Orleans, where he worked in association with Tulane University. From 1978, he was affiliated with the San Diego Natural History Museum. Work Burkenroad's research interests were unusually broad, including astrophysics, Acheulean hand axes, and Lewis Carroll, as well as several fields of biology. In the world of fisheries science, he is best known for his radical views, first presented in 1947, on the history of Pacific halibut stocks. Contrary to the widely held view that conservation measures were responsible for reversing the species' decline, Burkenroad argued that a natural fluctuation was responsible, possibly related to cyclical environmental changes. Burkenroad was highly critical even of his own work, although it was known for its soundness and reliability. His most famous carcinological paper was titled \\"The evolution of the Eucarida (Crustacea, Eumalacostraca), in relation to the fossil record\\", and was published in 1963. This revolutionized the classification of the order Decapoda; instead of a suborder Natantia and a suborder Reptantia, Burkenroad placed the Dendrobranchiata as the sister group to all remaining decapods, in a group he named Pleocyemata. The 1963 paper was intended only as a preliminary analysis, although its sequel would not appear for another 20 years. Frederick R. Schram concluded his obituary of Burkenroad by stating that \\"Few individuals have had as great an effect on his science with so relatively few publications as has Martin Burkenroad\\". Burkenroad is commemorated in the names of several species, including Bentheogennema burkenroadi, \\"Metapenaeus burkenroadi\\" (a synonym of Metapenaeus moyebi) and Sicyonia burkenroadi. Bibliography According to his obituary, Burkenroad published over 50 scientific papers.                  * * References Further reading * External links *Martin Burkenroad papers, M-1283, Tulane University Archives and Special Collections *Finding aid to the Martin Burkenroad Collection, Online Archive of California. * The San Diego Natural History Museum Research Library houses a significant collection of Martin Burkenroad‚Äôs papers.

Founding and history In the late 1980s there were many changes in the trade union movement in Japan. The two major bodies of trade unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (S≈çhy≈ç) and the Japanese Confederation of Labor (D≈çmei), formed the National Confederation of Trade Unions (Rengo) in 1989, advocating the importance of the Japanese Labor Union movement being unified. On the other hand, a number of other labor unions which felt Rengo was too conservative, formed the National Confederation of Trade Unions (Zenroren), which had a close relationship with the Japanese Communist Party. There were some other labor unions which did not wish to join either Rengo or Zenroren, who formed the National Trade Union Council on December 9, 1989 with its slogan of being a \\"Real fighting labor union movement\\". This organization was born out of the Labor Research Center, which had been created by former S≈çhy≈ç chairmen Kaoru Ota and Makoto Ichikawa and former secretary general Akira Iwai. Unlike organizations such as S≈çhy≈ç or Zenroren, Zenrokyo regards itself as a council of its affiliated labor unions, rather than a national center of labor unions. Despite this, given that it has national coverage with its affiliated member organizations being widely spread throughout the nation, it is often regarded as one of the national centers of labor unions in Japan. Currently May Day march, Tokyo Zenrokyo holds a regular annual conference. Its most recent, the 23rd annual conference, was held in September 2011. Estimates of Zenrokyo's membership vary. Zenrokyo itself declares its membership to be some 300,000, while according to the investigation by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare its numbers were reported as 118,000 as of December, 2010. In terms of its membership, Zenrokyo is much smaller than Rengo and Zenroren. However, it is also the only one of the major trade union federations to actively organize foreign workers in Japan.General Union website General Union Affiliation Retrieved on May 16, 2012 Its membership rose to 128,000 as of the end of June 2011. Politically, Zenrokyo has had a close relation with the left group of the Social Democratic Party, and it supports both the Social Democratic Party and the New Socialist Party. However, Zenrokyo does not force its members to raise funds as an organization or to support the political parties mentioned above, and it regrets that this was done in the S≈çhy≈ç period.

The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season was an event in the annual hurricane season in the north Atlantic Ocean. It featured the third-most named storms for the third consecutive year on record. The season officially began on June 1, 2012, and ended on November 30, 2012, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. Surprisingly, two preseason storms formed: Alberto on May 19, and Beryl on May 26\\\\. This was the first such occurrence since the 1908 season. The final storm to dissipate (second-to-last to become organized) was Sandy, on October 29. Altogether, there were 19 named storms during the season, including ten hurricanes of which two intensified into major hurricanes. Storm impact during the season was widespread and ruinous, with the most significant storms in term of loss of life and damage being hurricanes Isaac and Sandy. A Category 1 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, Isaac was a large system that moved ashore the coast of Louisiana on August 12; the storm resulted in 41 deaths overall. Sandy, the second and final major hurricane of the season, was the largest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, with a wind diameter of more than . The system moved ashore the southern coast of New Jersey as an extratropical cyclone in late October. During its duration as a tropical cyclone, Sandy caused at least $68 billion (2012 USD) in damage and 285 fatalities. Sandy is the second-costliest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, surpassed only by Hurricane Katrina during the 2005 season. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

The project is based on national competitions which take place every year since 2006 and results in the selection of a ‚Äúdestination of excellence‚Äù for each participating country. The winners are emerging, lesser known destinations located in the 27 EU Member States, the Candidate Countries and the EFTA/EEA countries.  The objectives of EDEN  Tourism is a strategic economic activity in the European Union, whose importance is likely to continue to increase in the coming years. It has a great potential as regards contributing to the achievement of several major EU objectives, such as sustainable development, economic growth, employment as well as economic and social cohesion. For achieving these goals the European Commission has launched the EDEN project.  Selection process of the EDEN destinations  Every year, the European Commission publishes one call for proposals to offer its support to the national public administrations in charge of tourism in the Member States (as a rule the National Ministries or other public bodies having the same tasks) to take part in the project and organize a national selection procedure. Candidate Countries and EFTA/EEA are admitted as well and will benefit from the same promotional activities as all the EU Member States. Each participating country manages its own selection process during the first half of the year, organising a communication campaign to inform all possible candidates about the competition. Destinations taking part have to show that economically viable tourism has been developed based on each year‚Äôs EDEN theme. The winning destinations are those that best reflect the yearly theme and that offer a unique tourism experience, in line with sustainable patterns. In the middle of the year, a winning destination per country is selected on the basis of a set of award criteria established at both European and national level. The names of the winners are then communicated to the European Commission, who is in charge of organising a European Award Ceremony.  The EDEN editions  Each EDEN edition is developed around an annual theme, chosen by the Commission together with the relevant national tourism bodies. This theme functions as a leitmotif: so far, rural tourism (2007), local intangible heritage (2008), protected areas (2009), aquatic tourism (2010) and regeneration of physical sites (2011) have been the main EDEN themes. Each of the chosen theme serves to highlight different aspects of European regions‚Äô assets and is related to sustainable development in one way or another, whether from a cultural, economic, local involvement or environmental point of view. EDEN topics provide an opportunity for demonstrating the wealth of diversity Europe can offer, including its natural resources, historical heritage, traditional celebrations, local gastronomy, and so on.  EDEN 2012  In May 2011 a call for proposals was launched by the European Commission to support National Administrations in charge of tourism for the purpose of promoting the EDEN destinations awarded in 2007-2011 and for enhancing awareness of the EDEN rationale in trans- national partnerships. 18 countries participate in the project from November 2011 until August 2012: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Spain, France, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Turkey.

As such it is related to tunnel vision and \\"the slowing of time in the mind\\". The phenomenon is discussed in the literature on law enforcement officers and soldiers. In 2016, the attorney for Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby wanted the jury to hear about how auditory exclusion could have played a role when the officer fatally shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old black male. Auditory exclusion happens as a physiological side effect of increased heart rate. When the heart rate approaches roughly 175 beats per minute, the sympathetic nervous system is activated enough that the brain reduces the amount of attention it pays to hearing in order to focus on sight. Auditory exclusion only occurs when the increase in heart rate is caused by hormonal changes, and will not occur if an individual is voluntarily participating in an intense form of exercise.

Life  Prince Henry XXXV was the son of the prince Christian William I of Schwarzburg- Sondershausen (1647-1721) and his wife, Christiane Wilhelmine (1658-1712), the daughter of Duke John Ernest II of Saxe-Weimar. As a second son, Henry XXXV was, under the terms of an inheritance and succession treaty closed in 1713, not entitled to a share of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, but only to a small apanage). When he received Schwarzburg-Keula, he was upset with his family, including his siblings, and left the principality. He settled on a country estate in B√ºrgel and maintained good contacts with his uncle, Duke William Ernest of Saxe-Weimar. His elder half-brother G√ºnther XLIII died childless in 1740, and Henry XXXV succeeded him as the ruling Prince. He resided in Sondershausen Castle and in the market town of Reichelsheim. Although the Seven Years' War was raging during his reign, he did little to support his subjects. He was wasteful and loved ostentatious displays of wealth. For example, he owned a collection of diamonds worth half a million Taler, giving him his nickname Prince of Diamonds. He was also a passionate collector of state coaches. He owned 37 coaches, including two magnificent French specimens. His Gold State Coach is now on display in Sondershausen Castle. Henry XXXV was the most controversial ruler of his dynasty. He was very far from his subjects emotionally, and travelled outside his principality very often. Because of his strained relationship with his siblings, he left his allodial possessions to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg. He died unmarried in 1758, and was succeeded by Christian G√ºnther III, the eldest son of his younger brother August I.

He was the brother of Pavle Popoviƒá, also a literary critic and professor and one of the most influential critics. Biography Bogdan Popoviƒá, a Serbian writer, aesthetic and literary theorist, university professor, member of the Serbian Royal Academy, one of the founders of the Serbian Literary Herald and the creator of the 'Belgrade literary style,' was born in Belgrade on 20 December 1863. His work signalled the city's leadership of Serbian cultural aspirations. Popoviƒá studied literature and philosophy at both Belgrade's Grandes √©coles and at the University of Paris. Returning home in 1893, he became a professor at his alma mater, and twelve years later when the Grandes √©coles became accredited as the University of Belgrade he continued teaching French, comparative literature, literary theory and aesthetics until his retirement in 1934. Pavle Popoviƒá, his brother, was also a professor of Serbian Literature at the University of Belgrade. Bogdan Popoviƒá published his Anthology of Modern Serbian Lyric (Antologija novije srpske lirike) in 1911, the first attempt to create a literary canon of the most significant poems down the ages. He chose examples that reveal a constant and highly developed poetic expression as the hallmark of Serbian literary achievement. He was the first to distance poetry from folk heritage, proposing an alternative view of sophisticated forms with a broad poetic range and insight into the kind of understanding art offers. Popoviƒá founded the Serbian Literary Herald (Srpski knji≈æevni glasnik) in 1901, the most prestigious literary magazine in Serbia. Jovan Skerliƒá who died suddenly on the eve of World War I, was one of Popoviƒá best pupils at the Grandes √©coles, and later, one of his closest collaborators and colleagues. Following his mentor's footsteps, Skerliƒá first taught French at the institution where he had been educated before becoming Professor of Serbian Literature when the university was established (1905). Skerliƒá then went on to join Popoviƒá's editorial board of the Serbian Literary Herald, becoming chief editor for a time. The Serbian Literary Herald, however, ceased publication for the duration of World War I, but continued after the liberation of Belgrade until the Nazi invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941. All important Serbian writers published their work in its pages, while the magazine also included reviews, criticism and general articles on film, foreign literature, feminism and women's writing. As a result of Popoviƒá's hard work at the university and the literary journal, he was admitted to the Serbian Royal Academy of Arts (now known as the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) on 3 February 1914. Popoviƒá was one of the founders of the Serbian PEN Club (a branch of International PEN, and The Society of Modern Languages and Literature. He was also an art critic and a musician. Bogdan Popoviƒá was the great, unfulfilled young love of Draga Ma≈°in, n√©e Miliƒáeviƒá Lunjevica, the tragic wife of Alexander I of Serbia. The great love was fettered by the sad fact that Bogdan apparently was not deemed a good enough match for Draga's family, which had close ties to the Obrenoviƒá court. To compound the tragedy, Draga was killed in 1903 coup d'√©tat which toppled the Obrenoviƒá dynasty, in large part because of the royal marriage, considered inappropriate at the time, while Bogdan lived out the remainder of his life as a bachelor. Popoviƒá lived long enough to see the liberation of Belgrade in 1944, though the fall of Nazi Germany came as a blessing, the rise of Yugoslav communism was a total shock, especially the liberation of Belgrade by some Bulgarian troops who were formerly on the side of the Axis powers. He died in his hometown of Belgrade on 7 November 1944. General Estimate A photo of Popoviƒá. Long disregarded, Bogdan Popoviƒá's criticism has of late attracted increasing attention. With formal education, tutored systematically about reading and writing by the best authors, Popoviƒá was better equipped than any other Serbian literary critic, probably in quantity, quite certainly in quality. His emphasis upon form was French. He delighted in the well-constructed essay, adhering closely to a plan, and leaving no loose ends. His criticism still important because he made use of principles in judging a work. He developed a Leibnitzian conception of the oneness of the universe, and he may have tried to make art fit into this scheme. His judgements of Serbian contemporaries and his admiration for the French language and literature are important factors to note. And even more are his contributions to critical theory. Though moderated with advancing years, his demand was for new literature springing from Serbia, for a style growing from within rather than imposed from without ('the Belgrade style'). Power he regarded as more important than form. Truly great poetry he believed must spring from a great national spirit. Quiet, dignified, reserved, Popoviƒá was a professor and a person of great repute. He collaborated with his brother Pavle Popoviƒá, Jovan Skerliƒá, Branko Lazareviƒá, Slobodan Jovanoviƒá and foreign literary scholars, like Canadian Watson Kirkconnell, introducing modern Serbian literature to the world. He was a man of pronounced civil decency, without any exclusive attributes, committed to the hierarchy of civil society values, an absolute enthusiast for France, which was his model in values and culture. Bogdan Popoviƒá was a man of great learning and analytical consistency. His approach was to examine the internal working of the text, what makes art a special category of human experience and a creative expression. He had a deep and sincere belief in the influence of literature on the soul and mind as a source of inspiration. For him, this was the realm where language was able to reveal not empirical truths but symbolic ones that might point to greater understanding of the human condition. In his teaching and writing he tried to develop there qualities in his students and the reading public, to raise their aesthetic awareness. In the twentieth century Popoviƒá's legacy has reasserted itself on occasions as a contrast to the Yugoslav communists' utilitarian approaches towards culture and the purpose of art in society. Perhaps for these reasons he was left ignored and forgotten until 1981.

History In October 1874, a petition was sent to the Minister of Education to have a school established in the vicinity of Rosebud. However, it was only signed by 25 residents and was unsuccessful. Then in 1894, another petition was made for a schoolhouse and a schoolmaster to be built, as children had to walk to Dromana or Boneo to get to school. It was again unsuccessful. Another application in 1882 was rejected, even though there were 32 children living in the area. But the next year, parents and school-aged children managed to find success with the Department of Education. A decision was made in 1883 to lease a building to be used as a school. A Head Teacher was appointed to the building and the school finally opened on 4 September 1884. 37 students attended; 21 of those were transferred from Dromana State School (now Dromana Primary School). In 1885, after complaints from parents about the schools problems, the Education Department purchased two-acres of land on the opposite side of Nepean Highway. The cost was ¬£20 per acre. In November, a school house with a teacher's residence was built on the two-acres of land. The building consisted of a 24 foot by 16 foot school room with an iron gable roof and a front porch. A skillion verandah ran the length of the building. 7 April 1887, school furniture from the original building was moved to the new building. The principal at the time moved into the residence, enrolling his four school-aged children. Then in 1888, a split post fence was built around the school site to stop the problem of wandering cattle and sheep from grazing in the schools shelter. By May 1893, 40 students were now attending the school. Most being children from lighthouse keepers' parents in McCrae. Enrolments continued to increase, as well as additional buildings. In 1944, there were now 114 pupils at the school. In 1954, Rosebud Secondary College opened, which meant the school didn't have to cater for Grades 7 and 8. But with secondary students being moved, the school was still overcrowded with 400 students now attending. As 1966 came around, the school committee wanted a library at the school. The Education Department paid a grant of $6000 for a library. And then a further $9630 was raised through fundraising. Construction started in February 1968 and finished in April that year. It was officially opened in November and named in the honour of the principal at the time. A farm is also one of the school's main features, with chickens, ducks and rabbits. There are four bunnies and three ducks. The duck names are: Daffy, Moth and Princess Lucy. There are also about 20 chickens. The idea of a farm came to Mr Fisher, the school's assistant principal. In 2012, MP Martin Dixon funded $190,000 for the school to complete planning for its $3 million modernisation.

The scheme also needs to be developed in a spirit of cooperation, not negative campaigns and other various forms of coercion and unfair pressures from one party to another. This is the spirit behind the establishment of the Indonesian Forestry Certification Cooperation- Kerjasama Sertifikasi Kehutanan (IFCC-KSK). Aims and objectives IFCC-KSK was established on October 19, 2011. Its objectives is to promote SFM by implementation of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) Scheme, which includes among others, but not limited to, certification of forest management, forest products, forest product-processing industries and the chain of custody. To achieve its objectives IFCC-KSK will coordinate and develop a credible PEFC-based forestry certification scheme in Indonesia, and establish a mutually beneficial cooperation between business community and the general public (civil society) in achieving SFM. Scope of activities IFCC-KSK intends to join PEFC as a full member and to become PEFC's National Governing Body in Indonesia. Scope of IFCC-KSK's activities includes, among others, the following: * To promote and strengthen cooperation between the business and civil societies in attempts to achieve SFM, * To faster a closer, mutually respectful and more productive relation among all forestry stakeholders at the national and global levels, * To work together with government institutions, including Ministry of Forestry, the National Standardization Agency and the National Accreditation Committee, in forestry certification. * To carry out training for auditors and undertake competency tests. Organization structure The IFCC-KSK structure consists of the General Meeting of Members (RUA), the Governing Body, and the Board of Supervisors. The Governing Board as the body that manages the whole management of IFCC-KSK, currently consist of one Chairman by Dr. Ir. H. Dradjad H. Wibowo, one General Secretary by Saniah and one Treasurer by Dewi Suryati. Board of Supervisors establish a Secretariat to carry out daily activities of the IFCC-KSK led by one Executive Director by Zulfandi Lubis,SH., one Program Manager who oversees the program staff, a Training Manager who oversees the training of staffs, one Public Relations Manager who oversees the staff communication/ public relations, a financial Manager who is in charge of an administration and financial staffs.

This conjecture has been referred to as \\"Grexit\\", a portmanteau combining the English words \\"Greek\\" and \\"exit\\",Economist Who Coined ‚ÄòGrexit‚Äô Now Says Greece Will Stay in Euro. By Flavia Krause-Jackson. Bloomberg Business, 28 June 2015 A year in a word: Grexit. By Ralph Atkins. Financial Times, 23 December 2012 and which has been expressed in Greek as ŒµŒªŒªŒ≠ŒæŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ,Pulse, 13/2/2012 (from ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨œÇ + Œ≠ŒæŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ). The term \\"Graccident\\" (accidental Grexit) was coined for the case that Greece exited the EU and the euro unintentionally. These terms first came into use in 2012 and have been revitalised at each of the bailouts made available to Greece since then. Proponents of the proposal argue that leaving the euro and reintroducing the drachma would dramatically boost exports and tourism, while discouraging expensive imports, which would give the Greek economy the possibility to recover and stand on its own feet. Opponents argue that the proposal would impose excessive hardship on the Greek people, as the short-term effects would be a significant consumption and wealth reduction for the Greek population. This may cause civil unrest in Greece and harm the reputation of the eurozone. Additionally, it could cause Greece to align more with non-EU states.  Detailed events  The term 'Grexit' was coined by the Citigroup economist Ebrahim Rahbari and was introduced by Rahbari and Citigroup's Global Chief Economist Willem H. Buiter on 6 February 2012. On 27 January 2015, two days after an early election of the Greek parliament, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the new Syriza (\\"Coalition of the Radical Left\\") party, formed a new government. He appointed Yanis Varoufakis as Minister of Finance, a particularly important post in view of the government debt crisis. During 2015 and 2016, the chance of a Grexit or even a 'Graccident' (accidental Grexit) in the near future was widely discussed.lefigaro.fr 18.

After the announcement of the bailout referendum on 27 June 2015 speculation rose. That day BBC News reported that \\"default appears inevitable\\", though it later removed the online statement. On 29 June 2015 it was announced that Greek banks would remain closed all week, cash withdrawals from banks would be limited to ‚Ç¨60 per day, and international money transfers would be limited to urgent pre-approved commercial transfers.  Background  = IMF's projection = The International Monetary Fund (IMF) admitted that its forecast about Greek economy was too optimistic: in 2010 it described Greece's first bailout programme as a holding operation that gave the eurozone time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members, but in 2012 the unemployment rate of Greece became about 25 percent, compared to IMF's projection of about 15 percent.IMF admits mistakes on Greece bailout BBC News, Business, 5 June 2013 IMF conceded that it underestimated the damage that austerity programmes would do to the Greek economy,IMF concedes it made mistakes on Greece M. Steves and I. Talley, The Wall Street Journal, Europe, 5 June 2013 adding that, in terms of Greece's debt, IMF should have considered a debt restructuring earlier.Greece:Staff report on request for stand-by arrangement IMF, Country report No. 10/110 (2010) As can be seen from the Figure A, IMF's forecast in the 2010 standby agreement said that the Southern European country would start to grow in real terms after 2011. But in fact the economy continued to shrink, and Greek real GDP in 2013 was about 76 percent of that in 2008.Breaking Greece P. Krugman, The Conscience of a Liberal, The New York Times, 25 June 2015OECD, National Accounts of OECD Countries detailed tables 2006-2013, Volume 2014/2  Dynamics  = Financial dynamics = In mid-May 2012, the financial crisis in Greece and the impossibility of forming a new government after elections led to strong speculation that Greece would leave the eurozone shortly. This phenomenon had already become known as \\"Grexit\\". Economists who favour this approach to solve the Greek debt crisis argue that a default is unavoidable for Greece in the long term, and that a delay in organising an orderly default (by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years) would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighbouring European countries even more. Fiscal austerity or a euro exit is the alternative to accepting differentiated government bond yields within the Euro Area. If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields, reflecting its high government deficit, then high interest rates would dampen demand, raise savings and slow the economy. An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result. The implementation of Grexit would have to occur \\"within days or even hours of the decision being made\\" due to the high volatility that would result. It would have to be timed at one of the public holidays in Greece. = International law dynamics = One US economist has argued that the legal grounds upon which the \\"troika\\", composed by the EU Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, has pursued the harsh macroeconomic adjustment plans imposed on Greece are shaky, claiming they infringe upon Greece's sovereignty and interfere in the internal affairs of an independent EU nation-state: \\"the overt infringements on Greek sovereignty we're witnessing today, with EU policy makers now double-checking all national data and carefully 'monitoring' the work of the Greek government sets a dangerous precedent.\\" He argues that a withdrawal from the Eurozone would give the Greek government more room for maneuver to conduct public policies propitious for long-term growth and social equity.  2012 Plan Z \\"Plan Z\\" is the name given to a 2012 plan to enable Greece to withdraw from the eurozone in the event of Greek bank collapse.Peter Spiegel, \\"Inside Europe's Plan Z\\", Financial Times, 14 May 2014 It was drawn up in absolute secrecy by small teams totalling approximately two dozen officials at the EU Commission (Brussels), the European Central Bank (Frankfurt) and the IMF (Washington). Those officials were headed by J√∂rg Asmussen (ECB), Thomas Wieser (Euro working group), Poul Thomsen (IMF) and Marco Buti (European Commission). To prevent premature disclosure no single document was created, no emails were exchanged, and no Greek officials were informed. The plan was based on the 2003 introduction of new dinars into Iraq by the Americans and would have required rebuilding the Greek economy and banking system ab initio, including isolating Greek banks by disconnecting them from the TARGET2 system, closing ATMs, and imposing capital and currency controls.  Implementation  The prospect of Greece leaving the euro and dealing with a devalued drachma prompted many people to start withdrawing their euros from the country's banks. In the nine months to March 2012 deposits in Greek banks had already fallen 13% to . A victory for anti-bailout lawmakers in the 17 June 2012 election would likely trigger an even bigger bank run, said Dimitris Mardas, associate professor of economics at the University of Thessaloniiki. Greek authorities, Mardas predicted, would respond by imposing controls on the movement of money for as long as it takes for the panic to subside. Against this plan, a political initiative, the so-called Menoume Europi was founded in 2012 by students in Oxford University, and it spread among Greek students in other European universities. The first demonstration took place in Athens, Syntagma Square in June 2012 in between two major elections that brought to the country political instability and financial insecurity. A Grexit, assuming that it coincided with adoption of a new currency, would require preparation, for example with capacity for banknote stamping or printing a stock of new banknotes. However, information leaking out on such preparations might lead to negative dynamic effects, like bank runs. Conversely, leaving the Eurozone, but retaining the Euro as de facto currency, would avoid the practical issues and relieve the country of the burden of its Eurozone responsibilities. In the event of a new currency being introduced, all banks would close for several days to allow old (Euro) banknotes to be stamped to denote that they were now drachmas, and/or a newly printed currency to be distributed to bank branches for distribution to the public when banks reopened. The British money printing company De La Rue was, according to rumours on 18 May 2012, preparing to print new drachma notes based on old moulds, which De La Rue refused to comment. The typical time between an order for a new currency being placed and the delivery of the banknotes is about six months. = Wolfson Economics Prize = In July 2012, the Wolfson Economics Prize, a prize for the \\"best proposal for a country to leave the European Monetary Union\\", was awarded to a Capital Economics team led by Roger Bootle, for their submission titled \\"Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide\\".\\"Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide\\" full text The winning proposal argued that a member wishing to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of its debts. The net effect, the proposal claimed, would be positive for growth and prosperity. It also called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the eurozone, along with a strict regime of inflation- targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by \\"independent experts\\". The Roger Bootle/Capital Economics plan also suggested that \\"key officials\\" should meet \\"in secret\\" one month before the exit is publicly announced, and that eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed \\"three days before\\". The judges of the Wolfson Economics Prize found that the winning plan was the \\"most credible solution\\" to the question of a member state leaving the eurozone.  Immediate economic fallout inside Greece  On 29 May 2012 the National Bank of Greece (not to be confused with the central bank, the Bank of Greece) warned that \\"[a]n exit from the euro would lead to a significant decline in the living standards of Greek citizens.\\" According to the announcement, per capita income would fall by 55%, the new national currency would depreciate by 65% vis-√†-vis the euro, and the recession would deepen to 22%. Furthermore, unemployment would rise from its current 22% to 34% of the work force, and inflation, which was then at 2%, would soar to 30%. According to the Greek think-tank Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE), a new drachma would lose half or more of its value relative to the euro. This would drive up inflation, and reduce the purchasing power of the average Greek. At the same time, the country's economic output would drop, putting more people out of work where one in five is already unemployed. The prices of imported goods would skyrocket, putting them out of reach for many. Analyst Vangelis Agapitos estimated that inflation under the new drachma would quickly reach 40 to 50 per cent to catch up with the fall in the new currency's value. To stop the falling value of the drachma, interest rates would have to be increased to as high as 30 to 40 per cent, according to Agapitos. People would then be unable to pay off their loans and mortgages and the country's banks would have to be nationalised to stop them from going under, he predicted. IOBE head of research Aggelos Tsakanikas foresaw an increase in crime as a consequence of a Grexit, as people struggled to pay bills. \\"We won‚Äôt see tanks in the streets and violence, we won‚Äôt see people starving in the streets, but crime could very well rise\\".  Political opinion  The centre-right New Democracy party has accused the leftist SYRIZA of supporting withdrawal from the euro. However, SYRIZA's leader, Alexis Tsipras, has stated that Greece should not leave the eurozone and return to the drachma because \\"...we will have poor people, who have drachmas, and rich people, who will buy everything with euros.\\" Past opinion polling had shown that generally most Greeks favored keeping the euro. Of all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in May 2012, the Communist KKE expressed support for leaving both the euro and the European Union.BBC News report 15 June 2012 ‚Äì \\"Greek election is euro versus drachma, Samaras says\\" However, its General Secretary, Dimitris Koutsoumpas, pondered: \\"The exit from the EU and the euro will be hazardous, a blind alley unless it is combined with a concrete plan, a programme for the economy and society, with a new organization of society, i.e. a socialist society with the socialization of the concentrated means of production, unilateral cancelation of the debt, working class and people's power.\\" Golden Dawn is also staunchly Eurosceptic, opposing Greece's participation in the European Union and the eurozone. On 21 August 2015, 25 MPs from SYRIZA split from the party and formed Popular Unity, which fully supports leaving the euro. In the September 2015 Greek legislative election, the party won 2.8% of the popular vote, winning no seats. Both the Greek government and the EU favour Greece staying within the Euro and believe this to be possible. However, some commentators believe an exit is likely. In February 2015, the former head of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said \\"it is just a matter of time\\" for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone,\\"Greece: Greenspan predicts exit from euro inevitable\\", BBC News, 8 February 2015 and former United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke described it as inevitable.Jon Stone, \\"Tory grandee Ken Clarke warns euro exit is 'inevitable' as Greece's supporters rally in London\\", The Independent, 15 February 2015 A leaked document revealed that, during informal discussions with one of the European leaders, then UK Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that Greece might be better off if it exited the eurozone. British officials declined to make their comments on the leaked document.Cameron told EU leader Greek exit from euro may be best option A. Nardelli and N. Watt, The Guardian, Politics, 26 June 2015  Economic criticism  Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Research Institute, accused IMF and EU of basing their negotiation position on unrealistic assumptions. As Koo pointed out, IMF's argument was that if the austerity programme had been implemented as assumed, no further debt relief would have been needed under 2012's framework.Nomura slams the IMF: The Greek bailout is highly unrealistic O. Williams-Grut, Business Insider, Finance, 15 July 2015 The EU's argument was that Greece encountered a difficult situation in 2015 because it delayed implementation of structural reforms. Koo said that the argument was highly unrealistic because structural reforms do not work in a short run, adding that the US did not benefit from the Reaganomics structural reforms during Reagan's era. After publishing documents which admit that the southern European country needs debt relief and a moratorium on debt repayment for 30 years,IMF stuns Europe with call for massive Greek debt relief A. Evans-Pritchard, The Daily Telegraph, 14 July 2015 the IMF was only \\"slowly beginning to understand\\" the Greek economy, said Koo.  2015 Grexit speculation  In January 2015, speculation about a Greek exit from the eurozone was revived when Michael Fuchs, deputy leader of the center-right CDU/CSU faction in the German Bundestag, was quoted on 31 December 2014: \\"The time when we had to rescue Greece is over. There is no more blackmail potential. Greece is not systemically relevant for the euro.\\" A following article in the weekly Spiegel citing sources from Wolfgang Sch√§uble's ministry of finance further spurred these speculations. Both German and international media widely interpreted this as the Merkel government tacitly warning Greek voters from voting for SYRIZA in the upcoming legislative election of 25 January 2015. Germany's largest selling tabloid, the right-wing populist Bild, raised further anger when it compared Greece to an unfair footballer: \\"What happens to a footballer who breaks the rules and does a crude foul? ‚Äì He leaves the pitch. He is sent off as a punishment. No question.\\" The German government's interference in the January 2015 elections in Greece was strongly criticized by leaders of European Parliament groups including Socialists & Democrats (S&D;), the liberal ALDE and the Greens/EFA group, when S&D; president Gianni Pittella said, \\"German right-wing forces trying to act like a sheriff in Greece or any other member states is not only unacceptable but above all wrong.\\" It has also been criticized by the German opposition party The Greens', with its speaker Simone Peter calling the debate over a Grexit \\"highly irresponsible\\". Economists of German Commerzbank said that preventing a Greek exit was still desirable for Germany, since a Greek exit would wipe out billions of euros in European taxpayer money, and \\"it would be much easier politically to renegotiate a compromise with Greece, albeit a lame one, and thus maintain the fiction that Greece will pay back its loans at some point in time.\\" FTSE \\"considers Grexit following the election to be highly unlikely...\\". On 9 February, UK Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting to discuss any possible ramifications in the event of an exit. According to a Bloomberg report George Osborne said at the meeting of the G-20 finance ministers in Istanbul: \\"A Greek exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the European economy.\\" In February 2015, the Russian government stated that it would offer Greece aid but would only provide it in rubles.Dow Jones Newswires Russia Fin Min: Could Only Provide Greece With Rubles If Athens Asks 10 February 2015 Kathimerini reported that after 16 February Eurogroup talks Commerzbank AG increased the risk of Greece exiting the euro to 50%. The expression used by Time for these talks is \\"Greece and the Euro Zone dance on the precipice\\". After an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers (20 February 2015), European leaders agreed to extend Greece's bailout for further four months. By late June 2015 negotiations on a deal had collapsed, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum for 5 July on the revised proposals from the IMF and the EU, which he said that his government would campaign against. The referendum was defeated by a margin of 61% to 39%. Eurozone finance ministers have refused to extend the bailout. Questioned on whether the referendum would be a euro- drachma dilemma, Greece's finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said that European Treaties make provisions for an exit from the EU but do not make any provisions for an exit from the Eurozone. A referendum as a choice involving exit from the Eurozone would violate EU Treaties and EU Law.  Theorized effects on world economies  = Effect upon the European economy = A political cartoon of the \\"domino effect\\" view of a Grexit. Claudia Panseri, head of equity strategy at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, speculated in late May 2012 that eurozone stocks could plummet up to 50 percent in value if Greece makes a disorderly exit from the eurozone. Bond yields in other European nations could widen 1 percent point to 2 percent points, negatively affecting their ability to service their own sovereign debts. = Effect upon the world economy = Europe in 2010 accounted for 25 percent of world trade, according to Deutsche Bank. Economic depression within the European economy would ripple worldwide and slow global growth. However, Greece represents just a small fraction‚Äîless than 2 per cent‚Äîof European gross domestic product (GDP).  Legality  A working paper published by the European Central Bank concluded: In the absence of any ruling by the European Court of Justice, the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is unclear. The Williams Stamps Farish Professor in Law at the University of Texas School of Law has suggested that under certain conditions, it is possible for a Member State to do so.Jens Dammann: \\"The Right to Leave the Eurozone\\" Texas International Law Journal, Volume 48 Issue 2 pp. 126‚Äì155, (PDF).

Gabriella Lev, artistic director and co-founder initiated the formation of the company in 1982 to release the silenced voice of women within Jewish tradition. She was joined by fellow artists Aliza Elion-Israeli, Ruth Wieder-Magan and Joyce Miller. Their vision of forging a theatre which is reflective of Jerusalem‚Äôs cultural and geographical context, grounded in Jewish texts and employing new forms and techniques of theatrical expression is forever coming into being. Theatre Company Jerusalem (TCJ) also performs and teaches throughout Israel and the world, in both English and Hebrew. TCJ has created 36 original theatrical and musical works ‚Äì see list below. Theatrical Influences and Techniques Major artistic influences in their works were; Director Jerzy Grotowski's work with Serge Ouaknine (a pupil of Grotowski), Andre Gregory and The Roy Hart Theatre. =Midrash Performance= *The Hebrew term Midrash (Hebrew: ◊û◊ì◊®◊©; plural midrashim, \\"story\\" from \\"to investigate\\" or \\"study\\") is a homiletic method of biblical exegesis. The term also refers to the whole compilation of homiletic teachings on the Bible. Midrash is a way of interpreting biblical stories that goes beyond simple distillation of religious, legal or moral teachings. It fills in many gaps left in the biblical narrative regarding events and personalities that are only hinted at. *The Hebrew word Bama has three meanings; 1) a stage on which a theatrical creation is presented 2) The raised area in a synagogue on which there is a table. This table is used to lay The Torah Scroll on, in order that the reader can read aloud the weekly portion from the Bible, 3) In ancient times, the plural of the word bama, bimot, signified raised areas of ritual which included an altar and some kind of sculpture. In ‚Äúmidrash Bama‚Äù the tern coined by the company, it is explained that the practice of ‚ÄòMIdrash bama‚Äô is throwing new light on the meaning of ancient texts by their transformation from the medium of the written word to the stage and performance Midrash performance uses the whole range of the human capability in art, to convey a meaning that only becomes fully apparent when placed in front of an audience. The performer, must have a highly trained body and voice, and spend many years refining and making the flexible connection between feeling, thought, psychic life and physical action. Thus on stage, they can interpret the midrash in its original language, using different tones of voice and singing, dance and movement and the particular juxtaposition of all these different human elements. It is the interpretation of the language, and the real-time encounter with the audience which gives birth to a particular meaning. Into midrash-bama come elements of colour (Often seen in costume and scenery), elements of rhythm, texture and editing (direction) additions (writing), which have been highly thought out and prepared before. But the actual midrash-bama which takes place in real time, is often very different in each performance, (just as the study of the same text is often very different depending on your state of mind and with whom you are learning.) See also Contemporary Midrash Educational-Artistic Programs The company‚Äôs work has led to the creation of a method for learning, perceiving and internalizing texts. TCJ creates and Produces an annual Midrash Bama festival whose aim is to present multidisciplinary theatre in an intimate setting in order to promote dialogue and intimacy. Throughout the years a diversified community of artists and teachers has grown around the company.

As of December 2015 Edward Hands and Lewis is in the top 2% of largest solicitors in the UK and forms part of the EHL Group. The firm has undergone several changes in recent years, having grown from a company of 20 staff with 3 offices to over 190 staff and 12 offices nationwide. History Edward Hands & Lewis was founded in 1897 and has served the Leicestershire area from a number of premises in the years since. In April 2010, the firm opened The Law Shop on Market Street, Loughborough - Leicestershire's first retail-style solicitors' office in a high-street location, and a response to the partial deregulation of legal services outlined under the Legal Services Act 2007, which was expected to see supermarkets such as Tesco introduce new drop-in centres for basic legal issues such as will-writing. In February 2011, Edward Hands & Lewis opened a new solicitors' office in Market Harborough, its third new premises in the previous two years. The new site created four jobs under the supervision of Edward Hands & Lewis managing director Jason Hathaway, who led the team at the St Mary's Road office from its opening. In March 2012, Edward Hands & Lewis opened refurbished offices at The Old School Rooms on Loughborough Road, Leicester - the company had outgrown its previous Queens Road premises, and the new site offered capacity for up to 50 people. Managing director Jason Hathaway told the Leicester Mercury that rapid growth had led to the firm \\"doubling up\\" in its previous, smaller locations, while the new premises would allow Edward Hands & Lewis to continue its plan of diversification into complementary professional services. Since then Edward Hands and Lewis have grown significantly and now have offices across the country and a growing staff, supporting a diverse range of services to UK clients.

This species is a perennial grass which is variable in appearance. The smooth, erect stems are up to 3 feet tall or more. The leaves and inflorescences are variable in length. The panicles are open and spreading or dense and spike- shaped. Plants from the main islands look different from those growing on the other Hawaiian islands. There are about 3,136,000 seeds in a pound.Eragrostis variabilis. USDA NRCS Plant Fact Sheet. This plant grows in several types of island habitat from dunes at sea level to ridges and cliffs at up to 3700 feet in elevation. It grows in areas that receive 40 to 100 inches of precipitation per year. On Laysan Island this plant provides the main nesting habitat for the rare Laysan finch (Telespiza cantans). The bird hides its nest in clumps of the grass. The grass also provides important nesting cover for the rare Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis). It is used by other bird species, such as the brown noddy (Anous stolidus), wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), and red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda). This plant was used as thatching by Native Hawaiians. It is also used as an ornamental grass. This grass is displaced by the introduced weed sandbur (Cenchrus echinatus). This displacement reduces the amount of available nesting habitat for birds.Flint, E. and C. Rehkemper.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 23, 2012. In the episode, a high-society bachelor party ends when an escort is found dead, and the Special Victims Unit must proceed with caution as influential people try to bury the truth, which may destroy the life of one of the detectives. Meanwhile, Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek) is blackmailed, and later he awakens in the middle of the night to find blood on his hands and a hooker's (portrayed by Pippa Black) dead body in his bed, her throat slit. The episode was written by showrunner/executive producer Warren Leight and Julie Martin and was directed by Norberto Barba. The episode featured a guest appearance from Dean Winters, who reprises his role as Detective Brian Cassidy for the first time since the episode \\"Disrobed\\". \\"Rhodium Nights\\" received fairly positive reviews from critics, with critics commenting mostly on the cliffhanger ending. According to the Nielsen ratings, the episode's original broadcast was watched by 7.16 million total viewers and received a 2.0/5% share in the 18‚Äì49 age demographic, making it the most watched program on NBC of the night. Plot During a bachelor's party at a penthouse, Clayton Hannigan (Eric Ladin) and an escort, Carissa Gibson (Pippa Black) find a dead pretty girl in a bedroom. Detectives Benson and Amaro (Mariska Hargitay and Danny Pino) respond and find the body in a swimming pool. A police officer explains that party-goers claim they found her floating in the pool and do not know her. Hannigan tells Benson and Amaro that he was trying to save the unknown victim. Detectives Fin Tutuola and Rollins (Ice-T and Kelli Giddish) learn that one of the partygoers is groom-to-be Will Brady and the police commissioner's son. He tells Benson he does not know the dead girl. Dr. Warner (Tamara Tunie) tells Fin and Rollins the victim had a lethal amount of sedatives in her blood, suggesting she was drugged, and semen in her vaginal cavity. Through her breast implants, SVU identifies her as Maggie Murphy (Meg McCrossen), a 16-year-old girl from Winnipeg who ran away from home six months ago. Will shows up with his lawyer (Sam McMurray) and presents Benson and Cragen with a video taken the night of the party that proves his innocence. The video, however, shows Hannigan and Gibson entering the same room Maggie did before she died. Hannigan confesses to putting Maggie's body in the pool, reasoning a drowning would create less suspicion, but still says he does not know her. Carissa and her lawyer (Reg E. Cathey) arrive and the former tells Benson and Amaro that she works for an escort service and knew all of the girls at the party except Maggie. The detectives decide to talk to Carissa's booker, Bart Ganzel (Peter Jacobson). When Rollins and Amaro arrive at Ganzel's residence, they discover an escort party and that Detective Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), formerly of the SVU, is now working as Bart's bodyguard. After a fight, Cassidy and Ganzel are arrested. Cassidy says he been working undercover for the past three years. Rollins and Fin question Ganzel, who says Maggie does not work for him and that the only escort he has not heard from is Anya, who flew home to Colombia the day after the murder. The detectives search Anya's apartment and find an empty pill bottle that matches the drug Maggie was poisoned with. Cassidy tells Benson that Anya used to work for another escort booker, Delia Wilson (Brooke Smith), who is Ganzel's main competition. Benson and Amaro visit Delia at her farm to question her about her escort service; Delia describes it as a \\"match-making service\\" and says she does not know Ganzel personally. Cragen urges Benson to back off of the case, because he is being blackmailed with photos taken from his undercover stint in the episode \\"Russian Brides.\\" Later, a former governor who was at the bachelor's party is found dead in his home. The detectives learn that he was with one of Delia's escorts and at his autopsy, Warner discovers the same drug in him she found in Maggie's body. Fin and Rollins interrogate the escort assigned to the governor. She says he was dead when she arrived and called her booker, Iris, who told her to leave the home immediately. The detectives call in Iris, who too denies knowing anything about drugs in the governor's body. Iris then tells Benson and Amaro everything: that Delia is a notorious madam waging a war against Bart Ganzel. She claims that Delia sent Maggie to Hannigan's party and had another escort drug her to destroy Bart's business. The detectives head back to Delia's farm and arrest her. Delia's lawyer Exley (Ron Rifkin) pays her $2 million bail, then warns the detectives that Delia has influence over extremely powerful people and they should leave her alone. That evening as Amaro is leaving the station, Carissa tells him she is afraid for her life. Amaro wants to take her into the station house, but Carissa insists she has to leave. At home, Cragen wakes up in the middle of the night, confused, to find Carissa in his bed with her throat slit. Production \\"Rhodium Nights\\" was written by executive producer/show runner Warren Leight with Julie Martin and directed by Norberto Barba. On April 25, 2012, Warren Leight noted on his Twitter profile that he had just finished the first draft of the season finale. \\"Thanks to everyone at SVU for all your hard work. Thanks to all tweeps/fans for your support.\\" Dean Winters returns to the show in this episode as Detective Brian Cassidy, who was last seen in the first season episode, \\"Disrobed\\", where he felt he should transfer to a narcotics unit of the NYPD. On May 16, 2012, Ice-T said on his Twitter profile that filming on the episode had finished: \\"Just shot the last scene of the 13th SVU season.. See y'all for season 14. #SVU Season Wrapped!\\" Being interviewed by Zap2It at the NBC 2012-13 upfronts, Danny Pino noted, \\"There is a huge cliffhanger at the end, so it's worth sticking around to the end.\\" Ice-T added, \\"Some people end up in harm's way, I mean the show is really about us going up against pretty much an organized crime family, well not really a crime family but some criminals who have their hooks pretty deep in the system. They got their hooks in the politicians, and really we're pushing against people who can push back, and it turns out to be a little hazardous for us.\\" And Dann Florek joked, \\"I think it's the biggest cliffhanger we've ever had in the show, stuff is flying, you know what I'm saying, stuff hits the fan. [...], there are deaths. Generally there's some deaths, there's some blood, you know what, I'm going to tell you the honest truth, I'm not one-hundred percent sure everyone walks away or not, it's exciting you know.\\" Dann Florek noted to TV Guide; \\"It looks like he could be a little shady, and it's up to Cragen to say, 'I know Brian and he's a good cop,'\\"; Detective Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), is now an undercover cop who is involved in the team's latest case. Unfortunately, Detective Amaro (Danny Pino) doesn't quite believe him. \\"It's contentious with Amaro,\\" Pino says. \\"Dean's character is not as affable as Amaro would like.\\" Dean Winters portrayed Detective Brian Cassidy throughout the first season of SVU. His character goes undercover again in this episode. In \\"Rhodium Nights\\", one part of Pino‚Äôs Detective Amaro's personal life ‚Äî a shaky marriage to Laura Benanti's Maria ‚Äî will be touched on. \\"There‚Äôs a scene that may or may not illuminate where their future is headed,\\" Pino hinted to TV Line. He also noted about the cliffhanger, \\"It doesn‚Äôt end well [for certain characters], let‚Äôs put it that way. In fact it‚Äôs such a cliffhanger, if I say anything more, I‚Äôm going to give it up!\\" Kelli Giddish said of the episode, \\"It‚Äôs a great cliffhanger, one that really mirrors a lot of stuff that‚Äôs been going on in front-page news.\\" Ice-T added, \\"A lot of people end up in harm‚Äôs way.\\" And having been down this annual road before with SVU, he reminds, \\"You don‚Äôt want to go into the finale bleeding or shot, because that is not good. It‚Äôs hard for [contract] negotiations, too!\\" In an interview with Yahoo TV, show runner/executive producer Warren Leight noted, \\"This episode is a real potboiler that involves a lot of politics, and in politics, you never know who to trust.\\" With a smirk, Leight continued, \\"I know viewers hear this about shows a lot, but I'm very serious when I say, do not turn off the last five minutes of this episode.\\" Bringing on Cassidy falls right into Leight's vision for the show throughout the 13th season, \\"A lot of what I was trying to do this year was pick up the interesting threads that have been left over the years. We brought Olivia's brother back in \\"Child's Welfare\\" and Fin's son showed up in \\"Learning Curve\\".\\" With the recent renewal of the show, Leight says there will be adjustments for next season, although he's not sure what those are as yet. He did mention that at some point during the show's 14th season the show will hit episode number 300, certainly a major milestone. \\"I think we really have to do something for that,\\" he offers. \\"I'm not sure what it is, but I'd like to figure out something special to do.\\" Pippa Black's (pictured) character is killed after she figures that someone is after her. Her body is found in Captain Cragen's (Dann Florek's) bed, with her throat slit. Pippa Black who portrayed Carissa Gibson said of the episode to the Australian News.com, \\"Playing this character was something new for me,\\" Black says. \\"Any role you do, you go outside of yourself, but you don't want to stretch it so far that it's unbelievable to you. Carissa is someone who felt no man would say no to her. I loved doing the role. And working with Danny Pino (Nick Amaro)... he's a very handsome man, isn't he?\\" Black added with a laugh. Black said to Yahoo Australia, \\"I thought, 'Oh my god, I'm going to have to be naked and on a stripper pole,' but my manager said it was a really great role and that I should have a look,\\" she explained. \\"So I was sitting there trying to scroll through the episode (script), and my god it was such a page turner. I loved the character, it was such a strong story of who-done- it.\\" Just two days after agreeing to take on the part, Black flew to New York to begin filming. \\"I love New York,\\" she said. \\"Spending two weeks there was great. We were filming New York stories on New York streets, so it felt very real.\\" She continued, \\"I guess the thing that sticks out to me is that last scene where I'm with (detective) Nick, it was the first time he sees her scared, when she's around him she's always seductive or very in control of herself but at this point she's almost helpless.\\" \\"Rhodium Nights\\" was partially inspired by a woman who claimed to be raped by New York City FOX 5 news reporter, Greg Kelly, who is the son of the actual NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. Kelly was accused by this woman who said Kelly took advantage of her after she had too much to drink. The case was handed to the district attorney's office, which later decided not to charge Kelly, based on insufficient evidence that a rape had occurred. Warren Leight has confirmed that the guest stars from \\"Rhodium Nights\\" will return for the 14th season's premiere episode, which will possibly be a two-parter itself, and it will pick up where the finale left off. \\"In fact, there were a number of scenes we shot that didn't make it into this cut that may make it into the next one. ... It's good to know who did it and why, and who's pulling the strings. I don't think we have every beat plotted out, and we may even do a two-parter to open the season. That's still in discussion. We have booked many of the actors so they're available when we begin shooting again in July. So just on that basis, we had to know who was complicit, because we had to know who was coming back.\\" Leight said to Zap2It. After filming for season 14 started, Warren Leight said to Today that while they were filming the season finale, NBC hadn't yet renewed SVU for a 14th season. Leight admitted that having a cliffhanger was a bit of a wink at NBC: \\"I thought, let's make it as difficult for the network as possible,\\" he chuckled. \\"I don't think that swayed them one way or the other.\\" Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on May 23, 2012, \\"Rhodium Nights\\" was viewed by 7.16 million viewers and acquired a 2.0 rating/5% share in the age 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Rhodium Nights\\" was the most watched program on NBC that night, beating both the season finale episode and an encore episode of Betty White's Off Their Rockers as well as a repeat of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which preceded this episode's broadcast. It was the second-most watched program in its time slot, behind ABC's Revenge but ahead of a repeat episode of CBS's Criminal Minds. =Critical response= Kristen Elizabeth of TV Equals said of the season finale, \\"Wow. After a somewhat lackluster season, Law and Order: SVU came to life in \\"Rhodium Nights,\\" their season finale, and gave us one crazy cliff-hanger. I certainly didn‚Äôt see it coming, but I will back in the fall to see what happens, so score one for SVU!\\" Teresa L. of TV Fanatic ranked the episode a 5.0/5.0 and noted, \\"The cliffhanger really renewed my interest in catching the next season.\\" Valerie Milano of Hollywood Today felt differently about the episode and left a mixed-to-negative review: \\"Without revealing any spoilers, I can tell you that this show maximized uncomfortable tension within the team surrounding the sensitive nature of the investigation and what they could and could not focus on. Further, there were some familiar faces, including a former cast member from several years ago. This episode gets messy and involved. It does not, however, get resolved. It doesn‚Äôt even partially resolve. It merely sets up the next season and then offers a nasty cliffhanger. The whole thing strikes me as a cheap way to get people to come back and watch. I‚Äôve been a fan of the show for the several years and I‚Äôm sorry to say that I am disappointed. This is the first season without Detective Stabler, and frankly, the show suffers because of it. The chemistry and tension between characters just doesn‚Äôt hit the same mark. The show seems to need more and more outrageous situations because it lacks the underlying charm, friction, and character dichotomy of the main characters. Even Tutuola and Munch seem to have lost something. All in all, the show is not what it once was.\\" Milano continued with, \\"That being said, it‚Äôs still more solid than a number of shows out there. While attempting to look at the show through new eyes, it‚Äôs still watchable; it just isn‚Äôt as enjoyable as it used to be. There‚Äôs still lots of drama and horror at the depravity the human race can sink to. However, I do believe that this next season will be the last unless they can get back some of the magic that they have lost.\\" Former sex crimes prosecutor Allison Leotta positively reviewed the episode saying, \\"The SVU finale ‚ÄúRhodium Nights‚Äù ended Season 13 with a bang. This was a fast-paced, fun episode (to the extent anything involving two murdered escorts can be ‚Äúfun‚Äù), based on a couple of interesting real-life cases.\\" And she also said, \\"I can‚Äôt believe we have to wait until Season 14 to find out what happens with Cragen.\\" But she gave the episode an \\"A-\\".

An advertisement for Balmbras music hall in Newcastle from the Newcastle Courant November 27th 1840 when Balmbras was first opened In about 1848 a first floor room of the Wheatsheaf Public House at 6 Cloth Market, Newcastle, was opened and in later advertisements was called \\"The Royal Music Saloon\\" (this name appears in advertisements dated 1859). A token to gain entry to Balmbras music hall in Newcastle Around 1862, the room was rebuilt/converted, and the proprietor at this time was John Balmbra. It was here that the song \\"Blaydon Races\\" was first performed by George \\"Geordie\\" Ridley in 1862, The song referring to the Music Hall by name, as the starting point of the trip - \\"I took the bus from Balmbra‚Äôs and she was heavy-laden, Away we went along Collingwood Street, that‚Äôs on the road to Blaydon.\\"‚Äù In 1864 The Wheatsheaf was taken on by Mr T Handford. Thomas Handford (1835-1876) and his elder brother, Henry (1829-1888), blackface artistes, were the sons of John Handford (b.1801), who in 1841 was the licensee of The Green Man in Jackson‚Äôs Row, Manchester. In May 1856, or thereabouts, the Brothers Handford, as they were known, worked a six- month engagement in the Saloon at the Wheatsheaf with John Balmbra who had been running the place since 1850, if not before. The Handfords took their customary, farewell benefit at which, 'The Era' reported on 9 November, ‚ÄòMr Thos. Handford danced in a pair of splendid Morocco clogs the extraordinary number of 150 steps, and was most rapturously encored.‚Äô In 1857, the Handfords were back in harness at Balmbra‚Äôs Wheatsheaf. On 11 October 'The Era' decided that they had ‚Äòestablished themselves as public favourites, and appear to be the chief attraction.‚Äô They took their benefit before a bumper house on 3 December 1857. In 1863 Balmbra, whose health was ailing, struck a deal with Tom Handford - now known as 'The Black Diamond' - to take on The Wheatsheaf for a year. It seems likely that John and Isabella Balmbra may have retired to Alnwick where Isabella Balmbra died in 1870, two years after her husband‚Äôs death in Newcastle on 26 October 1868. Circumstances suggest that Handford took over on New Years Day 1864 and, by way of honouring his friend, he re- branded the Wheatsheaf as Balmbra‚Äôs Music Hall. Balmbra‚Äôs became home to Tom, his wife, Helen, his daughter, Catherine, and son, Thomas. On 24 January 1864 Handford put out a shout in 'The Era' for ‚ÄòBALMBRA‚ÄôS CONCERT HALL - (Lessee, Mr Tom Handford.)‚Äô where a host of talent was headed for ‚Äòthis old and favourite Music Hall‚Äô including a ‚ÄòMr J D Kelly (who appears in conjunction with Mr Handford in an excellent Negro extravaganza nightly).‚Äô A number of civic events had been arranged in Newcastle to mark the 300th anniversary of the birth of Shakespeare on 26 April 1864 one of which, according to the 'Newcastle Chronicle' of 26th, suffered, due to the icy cold conditions in the Town Hall. The 'Newcastle Journal' picked up on the report the following day and pointed out that among the reviews of the 26th, lay a suggestion that the civic party would have been far better directed elsewhere. ‚ÄòAmong those notices occurs the following modest paragraph which we venture to say is unique of its kind:- ‚Äò ‚ÄúThe glories of the Wheat Sheaf Music Saloon have suffered no diminution under the management of Mr. Tom Handford, and comic and sentimental vocalisation, and some very clever clog-dancing, were appreciated by a full house.‚Äù Why did not the reporter who discovered the astounding success of ‚ÄúMr. Tom Handford‚Äù rush off to the Executive Committee and announce the fact. With what haste would they have proceeded to the ‚ÄúWheat Sheaf Music Saloon‚Äù and then and there engaged the ‚Äúvery clever clog dancers for the edification of the icy audience in the Town Hall who, at that stage of the proceedings, had probably begun to yawn and vote the whole thing a bore. Whilst we acknowledge the unequivocal success attained by Mr. Handford in his celebration of the Tercentenary, we must be permitted to express our deep regret that our Local Committee were not permitted to share in it. . . . Good people all, please to consider Shakespeare ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù and your arduous labours at an end: for the future, regard yourselves as entirely free to exercise your little natural partialities, and to desert Hamlet and Othello for the more congenial ‚Äúcomic and sentimental vocalisation‚Äù of Mr. Handford, and the clever clog-dancing which you appreciate so highly.‚Äô Having served time with John Balmbra and eased Tom through his early days in the Cloth Market, Balmbra‚Äôs right-hand man, a Mr J E Jones decided to call it a day. On 3 August 1864 the 'Newcastle Journal' reported that he was presented with ‚Äòa massive gold chain and appendages‚Äô, presumably the gift of John Balmbra. ‚ÄòLikewise a splendid gold signet ring , by Mr. T. Handford, proprietor of the Wheat Sheaf Music Saloon, as a token of respect and esteem, and for his attention as manager and secretary to the establishment. The presentation was given by Mr. Handford himself; and in a few words, was suitably acknowledged by the recipient.‚Äô On Monday 17 October, as Handford‚Äôs time at Balmbra‚Äôs was coming to an end he persuaded his ailing wife to join him on stage. He placed a celebratory shout in the 'Newcastle Guardian and Tyne Mercury' on Saturday 15 October 1864. ‚ÄòMrs Handford, The most accomplished Actress and Danseuse of the day‚Äô was to appear alongside her husband, ‚ÄòThe Great Black Diamond, in their Celebrated Drawing Room Entertainment.‚Äô Handford‚Äôs departure was noticed by 'The Era.' ‚ÄòThe performances . . . under the management of Mr T Handford, concluded on Saturday evening, and on Monday the establishment opened under new Management, a very handsome new proscenium having been introduced, which gives the hall a very gay appearance.‚Äô The hall had been taken on by Joshua L Bagnall and Walter William Blakey and was henceforth known as the Oxford Music Hall. The name change appeared in adverts c1865, and new owner/managers in the form of Joshua L. Bagnall and Walter William Blakey. Adverts for the Music Hall appeared to cease c1879. Details published at the time showed that the stage was only in the region of 5 feet (1.5m) deep from front to back and the gallery was modified into a showroom c1883. Around 1891 reflected the end of the Music Hall heyday, the building becoming the \\"Oxford Restaurant and Public Hall\\". Unfortunately the building and its contents were completely destroyed by fire in 1899, by which time it was being used as a billiard hall. A new building, also containing a billiards room, was erected and opened 1901 as the ‚ÄúCarlton Hotel‚Äù. In about 1962 it became \\"Balmbra's Music Hall\\" complete with balcony at one end, but it was a poor imitation of the famous mid-Victorian Venue.

A microculture ‚Äì whether formed by a racetrack, a university, a holiday camp or a pub ‚Äì can be seen as having its own social micro-climate, with values and norms of behaviour of its own, to an extent differing from those of the general culture.Kate Fox, Watching the English (2004) p. 89 Such micro-climates are situational, specific to their own circumstances.Paul Stephens/Andrew Leach, Think Sociology (1998) p. 207 For instance, although a pub is considered part of the English culture, it also contains its own microculture wherein one can find a structured and temporary relaxation of social norms. The same is true in the case of a racetrack where spectators from all social classes converge amid a relaxation of the constraints of respectability. Kate Fox considered that \\"the social micro-climate of the racecourse is characterized by a unique combination of disinhibition and exceptional good manners\\".Kate Fox, The Racing Tribe (London 2002) p. 87 Microculture/mainstream Arguably the wider range of choices offered by the new mass media are increasingly allowing individuals to cohere within their own microcultures, rather than exposing themselves to the cultural mainstream.Nasar Meer, Sociology for Dummies (2011) p. 98 The fragmentation of postmodern consumer microstructures, with their volitional and ephemeral nature, also presents a pattern of mainstream erosion in the face of an increasing number of competing microcultures.R.

History In 1926, South Canterbury Finance Ltd started as a small-time lender to local businesses and households in the south Canterbury town of Timaru. It was then named South Canterbury Loan and Finance and it specialised in small personal loans. Allan Hubbard bought South Canterbury Finance in either the 1950s or in 1960. Lee says that Hubbard and Hugo Fanning established South Canterbury Acceptances and South Canterbury Credit Corp by 1960. They acquired South Canterbury Finance (SCF) by 1963 from a group of businessmen including a member of the Todd family. In 1964 Hubbard bought Fanning out, becoming the sole owner. The \\"originally modest\\" company began to achieve \\"real size\\" after buying Canterbury Finance from Humphrey Rolleston in 1986, in return for a 23% holding in Southbury Group, the owner of SCF and Hubbard‚Äôs other assets. Rolleston and Hubbard established a series of regional finance companies. Rolleston left SCF in 2004. By 1992, South Canterbury Finance had become New Zealand's tenth largest finance company, and in 1992 it was the seventh largest. Hubbard was considered the driving force behind the company's growth as it ultimately became the largest financial institution in the South Island. By the late 2000s, South Canterbury Finance had 35,000 investors and its assets were considered to be worth almost $NZ2 billion. South Canterbury Finance owned 13 companies including fruit packaging and warehousing company Scales Corporation, helicopter and tourism business Helicopters NZ, and a third shareholding in Dairy Holdings Limited, New Zealand's largest dairy farming group. In November 2008, SCF was accepted into the New Zealand Deposit Guarantee Scheme. In June 2010, Allan Hubbard stood down as Chairman of South Canterbury Finance and was replaced by Bill Baylis. Lending Despite its reputation as a South Island rural lender, South Canterbury Finance had made loans to property development throughout New Zealand, Australia and Fiji. At 30 June 2009, property loans were $414.2 million. Real estate lending represented 207 loans with an average net loan value of $1.15 million. Further, 37 per cent of lending was secured by a second or lower ranking mortgages. There were ten property loans greater than $10 million. For some lending, the interest was capitalised into the loan debt, so borrowers did not have to immediately fund interest payments. One example of a bad property investment was Oakridge Resort, the largest resort in Wanaka. In September 2009 Oakridge went into receivership, after a default on loan payments for a collapsed a 48-villa 25-hectare development. SCF was owed millions of dollars. As of December 2009, SCF had $1.55 billion of deposits and debentures which were guaranteed under the government's Crown Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme until October 2010. Rating agency Standard and Poor's stated that SCF had \\"urgent problems to tackle\\" and it moved SCF from \\"negative creditwatch\\" to a BBplus credit rating. South Canterbury Finance appointed corporate recovery specialist Sandy Maier as chief executive with a brief to restructure the finance company and its loan book. Collapse In August 2009, South Canterbury Finance announced a net loss after tax of NZ$67.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and reported that it had been in breach of lending covenants. Standard and Poor's downgraded SCF's credit rating from BBB- to BB+. By May 2010, perpetual preference shares in SCF with a face value of $1, which were not covered by the government retail deposits guarantee scheme, were trading at 30 cents, reflecting a high perceived risk of default. On 31 August 2010, South Canterbury Finance asked its trustee to place it in receivership after negotiations over a recapitalisation deal failed. At that time South Canterbury Finance owed depositors as much as NZ$1.7 billion and owned assets valued at approximately NZ$1.9 billion, including subsidiary companies in property development, vehicle leasing and insurance. The Government immediately paid out to all 35,000 investors $NZ1.6 billion under the Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Alan Hubbard was reported as blaming the Government and the other South Canterbury Finance directors for the receivership: as the directors had sidelined him and the Government had placed him in statutory management. Former Chief Executive Sandy Maier stated that SCF's collapse was caused by excessive debt, poor risk management, unnecessary complexity, poor governance and a \\"too big to fail\\" attitude. Maier said the global financial crisis accentuated some of these problems, but had not caused South Canterbury Finance‚Äôs collapse. Serious Fraud Office charges On 7 December 2011, the Serious Fraud Office laid 21 charges against five individuals in respect of South Canterbury Finance. The charges relate to a variety of allegedly fraudulent transactions which have a total estimated value of approximately $1.7 billion. This includes an estimated $1.58 billion from the Crown Retail Deposits Guarantee Scheme. The charges include entering the Crown Guarantee Scheme by deception, omitting to disclose a related party loan of $64.185m from SCF to Southbury Group and Woolpak Holdings, failing to disclose related party loans of $19.1m from SCF to Shark Wholesalers, and breaching the crown guarantee scheme by lending $39m to Quadrant Holding Limited. The five accused are; former South Canterbury Finance chief executive Lachie McLeod, former South Canterbury Finance directors Edward Oral Sullivan (a lawyer with Raymond Sullivan McGlashan) and Robert Alexander White, former chief financial officer of South Canterbury Finance, Graeme Brown, and Timaru chartered accountant Terry Hutton, formerly of Hubbard and Churcher. The alleged offences include theft by a person in a special relationship, obtaining by deception, false statements by a promoter of a company and false accounting. All five defendants deny the charges. Leading up to trial charges against Brown and Hutton were withdrawn. After a trial lasting five months, on 14 October 2014 the Timaru High Court handed down verdicts on the three defendants who stood trial. Robert White and Lachie McLeod were found not guilty on all charges, while Edward Sullivan was found guilty on five charges he faced, and not guilty on four other charges. Aorangi Securities On 20 June 2010, the New Zealand Government placed Allan Hubbard, his wife Jean Hubbard and his business Aorangi Securities and seven charitable trusts into statutory management, with Trevor Thornton and Richard Simpson of Grant Thornton appointed as statutory managers. This decision was based on recommendations from the Securities Commission of New Zealand after a complaint from an investor. Allan Hubbard established Aorangi Securities Limited in 1974. The directors were Allan and Margaret Hubbard and the share capital was owned by another Hubbard-owned company, Forresters Nominee Company Limited. Aorangi had operated as a finance company, having raised $98 million from 407 investors living in Otago and Canterbury and making loans of approximately $134 million to borrowers. The review of the Securities Commission concluded that many of the loans were inadequately documented, appeared to be unsecured and contrary to instructions from investors. The Serious Fraud Office initiated an investigation for fraud. Hubbard Funds Management In July 2010, Grant Thornton reported that Allan Hubbard also controlled an additional business entity that they had not been aware of when appointed. This was Hubbard Funds Management, an investment management business estimated to be worth $70 million. It had inadequate accounting records consisting of a hand written cashbook and journals maintained by Mr Hubbard. In September 2010, two further companies related to Hubbard Funds Management, Hubbard Churcher Trust Management Ltd and Forresters Nominee Company Ltd, were also placed under statutory management. In April 2012, Grant Thornton paid out an interim distribution of $9 million (or 13.4c in the dollar) to investors in Hubbard Management Funds. In May 2012, Grant Thornton reported that investors in Hubbard Management Funds were owed $82 million, and the fund was valued at $44.8m. Grant Thornton asked the High Court to decide how to distribute the fund given the lack of a prospectus and given that the 'largely fictional' investor statements had not been reconciled to investment assets for three years.  Subsequent events  In 2017 Kapiti sharebroker Chris Lee investigated the possibility of legal claims by investors, to be funded by an Australian litigation funding company, but these have not eventuated. In 2017 the High Court ruled that former investors would receive more than $9.4 million from the proceeds of Alan Hubbard's estate. In 2019 Kapiti sharebroker Chris Lee wrote a book The Billion Dollar Bonfire criticising the sale of SCF assets by the receivers as a \\"fire sale\\" and asking why overseas offers were not taken up.

Diplomatic and military career  In 1451 Gritti served as the Venetian ambassador to the Papal States. When the news of Ottoman preparations for the siege of Scutari reached Venice in early 1474, Triadan Gritti, who was 84 years old then, was appointed as the Venetian captain general instead of Pietro Mocenigo. Gritti commanded the Venetian fleet of six galleys that sailed early in May 1474 to protect the coasts of Albania, Veneta, and especially the mouths of the Bojana River. By summer Gritti's forces were joined by the fleet commanded by Mocenigo, who left Cyprus after first installing Caterina Cornaro as queen of the island. Gritti and Mocenigo were later co-commanders of the Venetian relief forces sent to Scutari. Ottoman forces attempted to blockade the Venetian fleet in the Bojana by clogging the mouth of the river with tree trunks, just as the Serbian voivode Mazarek did during the Second Scutari War. Gritti returned down the river with his fleet and destroyed the Ottoman forces on 15 June 1474. In Scutari, Gritti and Mocenigo ordered Leonardo Boldu to find Ivan Crnojeviƒá and urge him to mobilize as many of his men as possible to help the Venetians during the siege. Boldu was also ordered to transport Crnojeviƒá's cavalry and infantry over Lake Scutari. After the discovery of the treason committed by Andreas Humoj, a member of Humoj family, during the Siege of Scutari, Gritti sentenced him to death and had him executed by a man from Tuzi. In spite of his efforts, however, Gritti was not able to deliver to Scutari all the goods that his fleet carried because many of his ships were trapped in the shallow waters of the Bojana near Sveti Srƒë.  Death  Gritti and Bembo died of malaria in 1474 in Kotor. They both contracted it during the siege of Scutari when they participated in several skirmishes with Ottoman forces near the mouth of the Bojana River.

Much of its output is in the form of visible light, as well as heat or light in the non-visible wavelengths. An early study of flame luminosity was conducted by Michael Faraday and became part of his series of Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, The Chemical History of a Candle.  Luminosity  Circus fire arts rely on a brightly luminous flame, ideally with minimal heat output In the simplest case, the yellow flame is luminous due to small soot particles in the flame which are heated to incandescence. Producing a deliberately luminous flame requires either a shortage of combustion air (as in a Bunsen burner) or a local excess of fuel (as for a kerosene torch). Because of this dependency upon relatively inefficient combustion, luminosity is associated with diffusion flames and is lessened with premixed flames. The flame is yellow because of its temperature. To produce enough soot to be luminous, the flame is operated at a lower temperature than its efficient heating flame (see Bunsen burner). The colour of simple incandescence is due to black-body radiation. By Planck's law, as the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to longer wavelengths, i.e. from the blue to the yellow. However, the blue light from a gas burner's premixed flame is primarily a product of molecular emission (Swan bands) rather than black-body radiation. Other factors, particularly the fuel chemistry and its propensity for forming soot, have an influence on luminosity. The Victorian chemist, Edward Frankland, studied luminosity in flames and discovered that their luminosity also increased with pressure.  Bunsen burner  A variety of Bunsen burner flames. Bunsen burners may be adjusted from a highly luminous flame (left) to a hotter 'roaring blue flame' (right) One of the most familiar instances of a luminous flame is produced by a Bunsen burner. This burner has a controllable air supply and a constant gas jet: when the air supply is reduced, a highly luminous, and thus visible, orange 'safety flame' is produced. For heating work, the air inlet is opened and the burner produces a much hotter blue flame.  Combustion efficiency  Efficient combustion relies on the complete combustion of the fuel. Production of soot represents a waste of fuel (the soot could have been burned further) and may also be a problem for its build-up around jets and burners. Heating burners are thus usually designed to produce a non-luminous flame.  Oil lamps  Lamps for illumination rather than heat may use a deliberately luminous flame. A more efficient method overall uses a mantle instead.A Brief History of the Incandescent Mantle Pressure Lamp Like the incandescent soot in a luminous flame, the mantle is heated and then glows. The flame does not provide much light itself, and so a more heat-efficient non-luminous flame is preferred. Unlike simple soot, a mantle uses rare-earth elements to provide a bright white glow; the colour of the glow comes from the spectral lines of these elements, not from simple black-body radiation.  Flame testing  When performing a flame test, the colour of a flame is affected by external materials added to it. A non-luminous flame is used, to avoid masking the test colour by the flame's own colour.

He was mostly known in France under the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Empire, for his cataract surgery.  Biography  Son of Felice and Vita Pagano, Forlenze was born at Picerno (Basilicata), at the time part of the Kingdom of Naples, from a family of physicians. His father Felice, his uncles Sebastiano and Giuseppe were barber surgeons of the noble family Capece Minutolo from Ruoti. After attending the catechism class at Ruoti, he moved to Naples to study surgery and continued his formation in France under the teachings of Pierre-Joseph Desault, of whom he became a close friend and collaborator for his anatomical studies. Subsequently, Forlenze went to England, where he stayed two years, increasing his experience at the St George's Hospital in London, then directed by John Hunter; he also traveled in the Netherlands and Germany. Returning to France, he began his ophthalmologist career. He determined the different eye diseases and represented them on masks of wax.Rabbe, Sainte-Preuve, Biographie universelle et portative des contemporains, Chez l'√©diteur, 1836, p.1721 In 1797, he practised an eye surgery at a retirement home in Paris, in the presence of a commission appointed by the Institute, as well as several members of the government, and French and foreign scholars. In 1798, he became surgeon at the H√¥tel national des Invalides and the H√¥tel-Dieu of Paris, where he made many remarkable interventions. Forlenze cured the soldiers of Napoleon's army returning from Egypt, affected by serious eye diseases. He healed renowned personalities such as Jean-√âtienne-Marie Portalis, minister of Worship, and the poet Ponce Denis Lebrun, removing a cataract which had been present for twelve years from one of his eyes. Lebrun dedicated to him a verse in his ode called Les conqu√™tes de l‚Äôhomme sur la nature.O lyre, ne sois pas ingrate ! Qu‚Äôun doux nom dans nos vers √©clate Brillant comme l‚Äôastre des cieux ! Je revois sa clart√© premi√®re; Chante l‚Äôart qui rend la lumi√®re; Forlenze a d√©voil√© mes yeux. Joseph Fr.

The French Psychiatric Profession in the Nineteenth Century, Chicago Press, 2002, p. 63 thus Forlenze was sent into the French provinces to treat eye diseases. His activity extended to England and Italy, where he performed free surgeries in cities such as Turin and Rome. In Rome, he cured the Cardinal Doria and was publicly honored by Caroline de Bourbon, Duchesse de Berry. His manuscript Consid√©rations sur l'op√©ration de la pupille artificielle (1805) is considered one of the most important medical works of the time.Salvatore De Renzi, Storia della medicina Italiana, Volume 5, Filiatre-Sebezio, 1848, p.430 Forlenze died on 22 July 1833, stricken with apoplexy at the \\"Caf√© de Foy\\", in Paris, where he spent often his evenings.

Career Buckley scored a last-minute goal for Castleisland Desmonds in the final of the 1985 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship to defeat St Vincents. Soon after retiring from playing he became involved in coaching. His coaching career began in Clare where he led Milltown Malbay in 1990 and Faughs in 1994 to Clare Senior Football Championships. He served as joint manager with Michael Brennan of the Clare county team in 2006. He then moved on to the Galway county team, working as forwards coach under the management of Peter Ford for a year. Then onwards to Galway club Moycullen, whom he led to the 2008 All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship. Buckley then served as selector alongside Mickey Ned O'Sullivan with Limerick for three years, during which time the county experienced narrow losses in the finals of the 2009 and 2010 Munster Senior Football Championships. He joined the Kerry senior setup in 2011. He then had to have knee surgery. He stood down from Kerry ahead of the start of the 2012 Championship, when Donegal knocked them out in the All-Ireland quarter-final.

Donie never stands still, he is pushing back his own concepts of the game the whole time. The game is always evolving so Donie will always evolve and find new ways, new approaches, new creativity.

He acted as a Swedish governor in Swedish Pomerania and later, under Prussian rule, as the chairman of the regional council (Kommunallandtag) of Pomerania and R√ºgen. As a result of his extensive building activity, Wilhelm Malte left many traces of the first half of the 19th century on the island of R√ºgen. Under his rule, his home town of Putbus was greatly expanded in the classical style and is still known today as \\"The White Town\\".  Life  Wilhelm Malte was born on 1 August 1783 in Putbus, when R√ºgen still belonged to Sweden as a result of the Thirty Years' War. He was the son of the Swedish Marshal of the Court, Malte Friedrich of Putbus and his wife Sophie Wilhelmine, n√©e Countess von der Schulenburg. After studying at the University of Greifswald and G√∂ttingen, he entered military service in Sweden on 21 July 1800 with the Stockholm Life Hussars. After becoming a Swedish chamberlain on 14 September 1802, Wilhelm Malte was elevated on 25 May 1807 by King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden to the rank of a prince (F√ºrst). After the end of French occupation, he was nominated in 1813 by the Swedish king, Charles XIV John Bernadotte, as Governor-general of Swedish Pomerania. This office was traditionally linked to the office of Chancellor of the University of Greifswald. As a result of the Treaty of Kiel, R√ºgen became Danish for a short time in 1814 and then went to Prussia in 1815, not least because of the involvement of the prince. In 1817, Wilhelm Malte's princely rank was confirmed by Frederick William III of Prussia, and so was his position as Governor-general. The office of university chancellor was approved and the honour of a hereditary Lord Marshal (Erblandmarschall) of the House of Putbus was bestowed on the prince. This also gave him the right to preside over the regional council (Kommunallandtag) for Neuvorpommern and R√ºgen.Norbert Buske: Pommern - Territorialstaat und Landesteil von Preu√üen : ein √úberblick √ºber die politische Entwicklung. Thomas Helms, Schwerin 1997, , p. 65. and an individual vote (Virilstimme) in the Pomeranian provincial parliament.Johannes Weise: Die Integration Schwedisch-Pommerns in den preu√üischen Staatsverband: Tranformationsprozesse innerhalb von Staat und Gesellschaft. GRIN Verlag, 2008, , p. 205. In the same year, he acquired the lordship of Spyker from Count Magnus Fredrik Brahe. He held the title of a governor-general as well as the corresponding salary, because an appointment as the President (Regierungspr√§sident) of the government district of Stralsund would have been tantamount to a curb of his powers. King Frederick William III entrusted him with diplomatic missions, such as the coronation of the British Queen Victoria. Under his rule, there was a building boom that has left an indelible mark on the island of R√ºgen, and he also presided over economic and cultural development. He was involved in sugar mills and chalk factories, had shipbuilding established in Seedorf and founded the first seaside resort on R√ºgen at Lauterbach. He had 655 acres of land settled with indivisible peasant holdings, held under hereditary leases. In addition, in 1836, he founded the Pedagogium Putbus, a school for boys from the middle classes and aristocracy. This laid the foundation of a tradition of education in Putbus that continues to the present day. The prince died on 26 September 1854 at Putbus of a bladder disease after a long illness. He was laid to rest in the family vault of Putbus in the church at Vilmnitz.  Progeny  With the death of Wilhelm Malte I, the House of Putbus died out because of the untimely death of his only son, Malte (born 16 September 1807, died 28 April 1837). The title of prince and primogeniture went to his grandson, Wilhelm Carl Gustav Malte, Count of Wylich and Lottum (born 16 April 1833, died 18 April 1907), son of his eldest daughter, Clotilde (born 23 April 1809, died 19 October 1894), who took the title Wilhelm Malte II, Prince of Putbus, bestowed by the Prussian king. He left two daughters and was succeeded by the elder one, Asta, Countess of Wylich und Lottum, Princess of Putbus. Upon her death in 1934, she left her estate, including one sixth of the island of Rugen, to her sister Viktoria Wanda's son, Malte von Veltheim (1889-1945), who took on the name ‚Äûvon Putbus‚Äú (with consent of the German minister of the Interior). He later turned against the Nazi regime and died on 10 February 1945, allegedly killed with a poisonous injection, at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His only son, Franz von Putbus (b. 28 May 1927, d. 5 April 2004), styled himself as Prince and Lord of Putbus (recognized by the judicial committee of the umbrella organization of Germany's nobility associations, and such entered into the Almanach de Gotha). He tried in vain to recover his father's expropriated fortunes, but his claim was turned down by the Federal Administrative Court in 1998. He however bought back minor parts of it, including a house on the Circle in front of Putbus Castle (which had been demolished by the East German Government in 1962). He was succeeded by his only son, Malte, prince of Putbus (born 1964).

It linked in County Armagh with in County Monaghan. The Armagh ‚Äì section was opened in 1909 and closed in 1957. The Castleblayney ‚Äì Keady section was opened in 1910 and closed in 1924. History In 1899 a Bill was presented to Parliament to build a railway linking on the Midland Great Western Railway (MGW) with Armagh on the Great Northern Railway (GNR). It was defeated. The next year Parliament passed an Act to incorporate the Kingscourt, Keady and Armagh Railway Company, but the new company was unable to begin construction. Instead it reached agreement with the GNR to build the section between Castleblayney and Armagh, and abandoned the planned section between Castleblayney and Kingscourt. A new bill in 1902 reincorporated it as the Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh Railway Company. Construction began in 1903 but the first services did not run until 31 May 1909, when the between Armagh and Keady was opened. The section between Castleblayney and Keady was opened on 11 November 1910, and the GNR took over the company on 1 June 1911. The line attracted some freight but passenger traffic was light. Some passenger services were worked by a push‚Äìpull train formed of a single coach worked by a locomotive such as a BT class 4-4-0T dating from the 1880s. Freight trains were commonly worked by UG class 0-6-0s. The Partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the Armagh‚ÄìMonaghan county boundary between and into an international frontier that adversely affected traffic. The GNR closed the Castleblaney ‚Äì Keady section on 10 August 1924 and withdrew passenger services from the Keady ‚Äì Armagh section in 1932. In 1957 the Government of Northern Ireland made the GNR close much of its remaining network in Northern Ireland, including the remaining section of the CKA. Features Tassagh Viaduct The line's summit at Carnagh was above sea level, the highest place on the GNR. The ‚Äìlong Tassagh Viaduct, north of Keady, is a composite. Its spandrels and parapets are stone, but its piers are reinforced concrete and the piers and the undersides of its 11 arches are faced with brick. This is a substantial saving in weight and construction compared with earlier purely stone or brick viaducts. The viaduct over the Callan River at Ballyards, by contrast, is faced entirely with stone.

It is produced, marketed and distributed by CBR Brewing Company, Inc., which is a Virgin Islands-owned holding company located in Hong Kong. It jointly owns the brand and breweries along with Guangdong Blue Ribbon Group under a sub-licensing agreement with the Pabst Brewing Company. According to a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, the CBR Brewing Co. was established in 1988.Company Overview of CBR Brewing Company Inc., Bloomberg Businessweek (accessed May 11, 2016). China Pabst beer was first produced in China under the Pabst trademark in Zhaoqing Brewery located in Zhaoqing, Guangdong. The brewery itself is located in the suburbs between the streets of Ban Yue road, Kangle North road and Cui Xing road. Its exact geolocation is labeled as Blueribbon beer on the Google map of Zhaoqing. The beer is now produced in three other breweries in other parts of China as well and it is uncertain as to whether the Zhaoqing brewery remains the main location for brewing. The cooperation between the two sides started with Pabst selling three previously mothballed breweries to their future partners in China. As of 1999, the Zhaoqing brewery offered free tours of the inside of the brewery including the bottling area, brewery outside grounds and the actual beer making facilities. The brewery also offered beer tastings at that time. Unlike the American version of Pabst Blue Ribbon, China Pabst has sought to position itself as a luxury brand, with bottles of its 1844 branded beer costing $44 (by 2018 standards).Barbara Kiviat, In China, Pabst Blue Ribbon is Pure Gold, Time, 28 July 2010.

He was born in 1918 in Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan and learned English from an American Methodist in a college in Tokyo. He was one of the officers in charge of the construction of the \\"Death Railway\\" which ran between Thailand and Burma and included the famous bridge over the River Kwai, and is known for the use of forced labour of Allied prisoners of war in addition to romusha - local civilians pressed into labour - who formed the majority of the workforce and resulting deaths. Nagase was first introduced to the British public in the documentary made by ex-POW John Coast about the realities of life on the Thai-Burma Railway, which was first broadcast in the UK on BBC2 on 15 March 1969. It was repeated on BBC1 on 4 August 1969 and again on Boxing Day 1974. The documentary was an early colour broadcast and part of the series One Pair of Eyes. Return to the River Kwai featured interviews with Nagase and two other Japanese soldiers who had worked with the prisoners on the railway. Nagase acted as both interpreter for the two other soldiers and interviewee. A transcript of the documentary and Nagase's responses to Coast's questions about the treatment of the POWs and some of the Japanese accused of war crimes after the war (plus some of Nagase's responses that did not make it into the final edit of the documentary) can be found in the new 2014 edition of Coast's book Railroad of Death originally published in 1946. Nagase was also noted for his reconciliation with former British Army officer Eric Lomax, whom he interrogated and tortured at a Japanese prisoner- of-war camp in 1942. Lomax then went on to discuss his reconciliation and eventual friendship with Nagase in his autobiography, The Railway Man. The book chronicled his experience before, during, and after the Second World War. It won the 1996 NCR Book Award and the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography. Nagase also wrote a book on his own experiences during and after the war entitled Crosses and Tigers, and financed a Buddhist temple at the bridge to atone for his actions during the war. The reconciliation between the two men was filmed as a documentary Enemy, My Friend? (1995), directed by Mike Finlason. After the end of the Second World War, Takashi Nagase became a devout Buddhist priest and tried to atone for the Japanese army's treatment of prisoners of war. He made more than 100 missions of atonement to the River Kwai in Thailand. He died in 2011. In television and films Nagase is portrayed by Randall Duk Kim in the 1996 BBC TV film Prisoners in Time, based on the story of Eric Lomax, who is played by John Hurt, with Rowena Cooper as his wife, Patti. In the 2001 film To End All Wars, based on the autobiography of Ernest Gordon, Nagase is portrayed by Yugo Saso, with Ciar√°n McMenamin as Gordon. In the 2013 film The Railway Man, based on Lomax's autobiography, Nagase is portrayed by Hiroyuki Sanada, with Colin Firth as Lomax and Nicole Kidman as Patti.

It occurred in second-growth-forest as well as Polynesian 'ohe thickets (and likely bred exclusively in the latter) in river valleys and hillsides. It was last seen in 1987, and is presumed to have gone extinct due to habitat destruction by hydroelectric power, road-building, and exploitation of bamboo, as well as the introduction of the invasive species such as the miconia tree, the common myna, and the feral cat. However, two unconfirmed sightings in the 21st century indicate that it may possibly survive in very low numbers.

It took to the skies over Newcastle four times in the Spring/Summer of 1825 and three times in September 1831. This in itself was a remarkable achievement in the days when travel was usually by foot, or horse, or by 1831 rail, but rail was still restricted to a few small areas of the country. Details At the time there were a family of Balloonists from London, Charles Green, who flew from London to Weilburg, Duchy of Nassau (Germany) in 1836 and by the time he retired in 1852, he had flown in a balloon more than 500 times. He had a son George who was born in 1807 and made 83 ascents. It is not certain that this family are the ones making the Newcastle ascents. The ascents were recorded in short comments in both Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings of 1891 (on page 222) and France's Songs of the Bards of the Tyne ‚Äì 1850 (on page c331). Ascents On Wednesday 11 May 1825 Messrs George and C Green ascended from Nun's Field in Newcastle. Unfortunately it was cloudy and they were soon lost to the gathered spectators. They subsequently descended slightly to gratify the throngs before re-ascending and eventually landing at Newbiggen (a distance of approx 4 miles) On Whit Monday, 23 May, they again lifted off from the same spot, but due to a faulty valve made a forced landing at Low Elswick White-Lead Works, damaging the basket in the process. Not to be beaten, they tried again a week later on Monday, 30 May, also from Nun‚Äôs Field, and ascended almost vertically to the great delight of the onlookers, before heading south and landing near the Tontine Inn, near Northallerton in North Yorkshire, almost 50 miles away The balloon was taken to Stockton where another 45-minute flight took place on 16 June. George Green made a shorter 13-minute flight from Palace Green, Durham on 5 July and reached a height 2,200 feet. On Race Thursday 14 July both Mr George & a Mr W Green made a fourth flight from the Nun's Field. The weather was perfect and after 20 minutes in the air they landed near (then known as) Long Benton, approx 3 miles away. There were great celebrations all over the country on 8 September 1831, The day of King William IV's coronation. In Newcastle, Mr Green and his companion, a Major Callender, lifted off again, this time from Spittal Field. It was Mr Green's 96th flight in total. The balloon hovered for some time before being carried of westerly, landing after a flight of approx. 30 minutes and 8 miles, at Close House, near Heddon-on- the-Wall. On 12 September, Green and Callendar again ascended, this time from the yard of the gas company in Manors, Newcastle. The weather on the day was quite favourable and the huge crowd took over virtually every space in the areas which had a view of the yard. After hovering for a considerable time, the balloon slowly drifted first West, and then to the North-East and after about an hour, landed 3 miles away in Low Gosforth. On 19 September Mr Green again ascended, but this time he had a passenger, a Miss Oyston, daughter of a South Shields Brickmaker, and the first female to \\"fly\\" from Newcastle. The flight took off from the Corporation Depot at Manors, Newcastle, lasted approx.. 35 minutes, landing in a field, which was known locally as Saltwick Hawes, near Stannington.

It was heard in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Cloete J from 9 to 13 October 1995, with judgment handed down on 16 October. AO Cook and DN Unterhalter appeared for the accused, and ZH de Beer and H. Louw for the state. The case is especially significant for South African criminal law.  Facts  Friedman, the accused, was charged in the Supreme Court with fraud involving the smuggling of stolen, unwrought gold. Millions of rands were involved, and the charges were of an intricate and complex nature. The accused contended, in the first instance, that the charge against him should be quashed, arguing that it did not comply with the provisions of section 84 of the Criminal Procedure Act, relating to the essentials of the charge. The accused furthermore contended that the common-law definition of fraud, as accepted by the courts, was unconstitutional insofar as the courts have held that the prejudice does not have to be financial or proprietary, may be potential, and does not have to be suffered by the represent. The court dealt first with the contention that the charge should be quashed for want of compliance with the Act. After analysing the charge, the court pointed out certain aspects which lacked clarity. The prosecutor conceded that the charge lacked clarity in the respects pointed out by the court, and requested an opportunity suitably to amend the charge. Despite this, the accused persisted in his application for the indictment to be quashed.  Judgment  In S v Nathaniel,1987 (2) SA 225 (SWA). the court did indeed quash an indictment without giving the State an opportunity to amend the charge or supplement the further particulars. The present court held, however, that, assuming such an approach was permissible, it should only be adopted where the indictment was so patently unsalvageable that no purpose would be served in giving the prosecutor an opportunity to cure the defects. The court held that, in casu, the charge was not unsalvageable and that the State should be given the opportunity to rectify the situation. The request for the quashing of the charge was dismissed. After briefly dealing with the accused's second contention, the court turned to the question regarding the constitutional validity of the common-law crime of fraud. The accused argued that the crime, as presently formulated, would punish the individual without sufficient regard to the actual consequences of his or her actions. It was submitted # that actual prejudice, and not merely potential prejudice, should be proved; # that the prejudice ought to have been patrimonial; and # that the prejudice had to have been suffered by the represent, not by third parties. From this, it was argued, would flow a constitutionally consistent definition of fraud. As presently formulated, the definition thus infringed upon the accused's right to freedom of the person and constituted an infringement of the substantive concept of a fair trial. The court reaffirmed that radical and sweeping changes could not be embarked upon lightly. The radical approach suggested by counsel for the accused was found to be neither necessary nor desirable. The court held that, although wide, the present definition of fraud did not make it difficult, much less impossible, to ascertain the type of conduct which fell within it. Redress at civil law was confined to persons actually prejudiced, whereas it was not the primary function of the criminal law to satisfy wronged individuals, but rather to punish people who have transgressed defined norms. The court therefore held that the type of prejudice relied on by the State, and hitherto accepted by the courts, was not so far removed from the moral values of the man on the street that a reappraisal of the common-law definition of fraud was either warranted or necessary.

The Mountaineers Books, Seattle, Washington. (softcover, ) p. 179. at its maximum, of the 3-member Tonto Group. It is famous for being the highly-resistant mostly-horizontal unit above the 1,000 my (1 by), Great Unconformity expressed areally in the Grand Canyon of Arizona; also in other areas of Arizona and adjacent Nevada. The Tapeats Sandstone is the highly erosion-resistant unit laid upon the Vishnu Basement Rocks in the central, parts of east, and parts of west Grand Canyon, Arizona. The unit comprises the 'base horizontal unit' of the platform around Granite Gorge (Inner Gorge) on the Colorado River, and because of its hardness, creates the Tonto Platform upon which the slope-forming, Bright Angel Shale, (extensive, and distinctively soft drab-greenish), and above it low cliff-forming cliff of Muav Limestone lie. The Tapeats Sandstone and the Tonto Platform follow the Colorado River, and surrounding tributary canyons, creeks, watercourses, or washes, in a dendritic fashion, much like the branches of a tree. The Tapeats unit is the bottom member of the Tonto Group, a typical marine transgression series of sandstone-(conglomerate)-shale- limestone, all part of a paleo sea, initially adjacent to land, the source of the Tapeats rocks-(conglomerates) and sand; (a regressing sequence has the reverse order). The Tapeats Sea at the early Devonian ceased to deposit more Muav Limestone, and a period of erosion ensued, a deposition unconformity. The Tapeats Sandstone was laid upon the Vishnu Basement Rocks, after an unconformity of erosion, the Great Unconformity, of 1,000 million years (1.0 billion). Besides the erosion unconformity, the Unkar Group of the basement rocks are also at an angular unconformity, being an 8-member sequence tilted at 45 degrees. The horizontal Tonto Platform has hiking trails that cross it from the South Rim to North Rim, Grand Canyon for instance. The extensive Tonto Trail lies on parts of the Tapeats Sandstone, and the platform on the south side of Granite Gorge.

She was one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. Delaporte was the widow of a baker. She was a professional fortune teller who claimed to see visions in a glass of water after it had been prepared with spells. During the Poison Affair she was pointed out as a customer of the master poisoner Maitre Pierre, who claimed that she, as well as Marie Bosse, La Voisin, and Catherine Trianon, all bought poison from him for the use of their clients. Delaporte herself claimed, that when a customer asked her to foretell the death of her spouse, she would always answer that it was in the hands of God. It was Delaporte who introduced La Voisin to her lover, the alchemist Denis Poculot. Poculot was later kidnapped by the marquis de Termes, who demanded that he manufacture gold for him, and it was the release of Poculot which would be the official errand of the poisoned petition La Voisin attempted to present King Louis XIV of France in her attempted regicide. Delaporte was also among those pointed out by Marguerite Monvoisin to have participated in the black masses arranged by Etienne Guibourg for Madame de Montespan. She was to have participated together with La Pelletier. Delaporte belonged to the group consisting of 14 individuals to have had direct contact with de Montespan, alongside Monvoisin, Guibourg, Adam Lesage, Romani, Bertrand, Monsieur and Madame Vautier, Magdelaine Chapelain, Philippe Galet, Latour, La Pelletier, Lafrasse and La Belliere, and who were therefore not put on trial, but imprisoned for life without trial by a lettre de cachet.

Retrieved 13 May 2012. Early life Loiseau was born in Paris and was brought up there, and at Pontoise, by parents who owned a butchers shop. He served an apprenticeship with a decorator who was a friend of the family. In 1887, when a legacy from his grandmother allowed him to concentrate on painting, he enrolled at the √âcole des arts d√©coratifs where he studied life- drawing. However, a year later he left the school after an argument with his teacher.\\"Gustave Loiseau (1865 - Paris - 1935 - Paris)\\", Galeries Hurtebize. Retrieved 15 May 2012. Career While working as a decorator, Loiseau redecorated the apartment of the landscape painter Fernand Quigon (1854-1941). After he left the √âcole des arts d√©coratifs, he invited Quignon tutor him in painting. In 1890, he went to Pont-Aven in Brittany for the first time, fraternizing with the artists there, especially Paul Gauguin and √âmile Bernard. After experimenting with Pointillism, he adopted his own approach to Post-Impressionism, painting landscapes directly from nature. His technique known as en treillis or cross-hatching gave his works a special quality, now recognized as his speciality. Loiseau first exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in 1893 and at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale in 1895 as well as at impressionist exhibitions in 1890 and 1896. Loiseau died in Paris on 10 October 1935. Paintings La rue de village, Saint-Cyr-du-Vaudreuil Loiseau's paintings, revealing his passion for the seasons from the beginning of spring to the harvests later in the autumn, often depict the same orchard or garden scene as time goes by. Series of this kind, which also include cliffs, harbours or churches, are reminiscent of Claude Monet. Although Loiseau did not complete many portraits, he often painted people at work: dockers together with their boats, villagers leaving a Sunday service in Brittany or arriving at the market in Pont-Aven, or even carriages in Paris driving across the Place de la Bastille and the √âtoile. He is also remembered for his paintings of Paris streets such as the Rue de Clignancourt or the Avenue de Fiedland. From the 1920s, he painted many still-lifes. His overall approach, rather than being associated with any particular theory, is simply an attempt to represent scenes as sincerely as possible.

His works include a page in a Missal for Poitiers Use, the La Rochefoucauld Hours, and two other Books of Hours. His middle period, characterised by tight compositions and sharply defined colouring, is typified by his Roman de la Rose, the Nouailher Missal and the Book of Hours, probably painted for Charles, Count of Angoul√™me about 1480. Surprisingly, 17 engravings by Israhel van Meckenem were included in the tome and coloured by Testard.

She was one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. In March 1680, Joly was arrested in connection to the Poison Affair, when she was pointed out by Etienne Guibourg. She was described as a skillful professional poisoner and poison manufacturer who equalled La Voisin in rank, and said to be extremely dangerous. During torture, Joly admitted being a professional abortionist. She also claimed to have knowledge of human sacrifices of infants during black masses. Marguerite Joly became the star witness in the case against Francoise de Dreux. Dreux had been acquitted in April 1680, but was arrested a second time because of the testimony of Joly. She pointed out Dreux as her regular client in her capacity of poisoner. She claimed that Dreux had poisoned two former lovers, Pajot and de Varennes; that she had tried to poison the Duchess de Richelieu, the wife of her lover Duke de Richelieu; that she had plans to murder her brother and sister-in-law Monsieur and Madame Saintot, as well as all rivals who was ever visible around her lover Duke de Richelieu. The first mentioned deaths could not be proven as murders, however, and the eventual attempted murders of the others had not succeeded, if they had taken place. Dreux left the country after the arrest of Joly, but a warrant for her arrest was issued. Dreux was judged guilty in her absence because of the statement of Joly. Marguerite Joly was sentenced to be burned at the stake. Before her execution, she was subjected to water torture. During the torture, she confessed to several murders and pointed out Anne Meline as her accomplice. She claimed that she had been present at the sacrifice of the nephew of La Poignard to Satan; at the sacrifice of an infant at a black mass for a Mademoiselle de Saint-Laurens to induce a desired marriage; that she had committed murder supplied with poisons by a female cosmetic in collaboration with Meline, who had also murdered Joly's former spouse. As soon as the torture stopped, however, she retracted her statements, with the exception of that regarding Saint-Laurens. She was executed the same night.

JWMI offers an online executive Master of Business Administration degree, graduate certificates, and executive certificates for working adults. The company is headquartered outside of Washington D.C. at Strayer University's corporate office - 2303 Dulles Station Blvd, Herndon, VA 20171. History The Jack Welch Management Institute was developed in 2009 in partnership with Chancellor University. The partnership was made possible due to the relationship between Jack Welch and entrepreneur Michael Clifford. Welch initially invested $2 million to purchase a 12% share of the company running the university, Chancellor University Systems. In turn, Chancellor named the MBA program The Jack Welch Management Institute. Welch wanted to create a high-quality MBA program that will integrate his philosophy of leadership and human resources into a 12-course program. Welch infused his principles of candor, differentiation, voice and dignity, people-driven management, and authentic leadership into the curriculum. The institute launched in June 2009, and classes began in January 2010. =Acquisition by Strayer Education, Inc= In April 2011, Welch approached Robert Silberman, CEO and Chairman of Strayer Education, Inc., to discuss moving the institute to Strayer University. Welch paid nearly $2 million to buy back his namesake and stated that \\"Chancellor wasn‚Äôt a good vehicle.\\" Strayer Education, Inc purchased the Jack Welch Management Institute from Chancellor University in December 2011 for $7 million. Welch invested $2.8 million to Strayer Education as a representation of his economic interest in the program. Academic Programs The institute offers an accredited Master of Business Administration, graduate certificates, and executive certificates covering various business-related topics through online classes. The online MBA can be completed in 18-months. The graduate certificates can be completed in 9 months and the executive certificates are 6-week programs. In March 2013, the institute launched a series of online, self-guided, self-paced management training programs under the Welch Way brand. Welch developed the MBA curriculum, drawing from his management experience as CEO of GE and his experience teaching managers and executives at GE's Leadership Development Center. In addition to helping shape the program's curriculum, he held the title of distinguished professor at the institute. He regularly addressed students via video stream and held video conferences with them at the end of each term. Welch expected the relatively low tuition and flexible schedule for the institute's MBA program to make it attractive to those currently employed but wishing to earn an MBA. He stated that he planned to grow the institute into the number one online business school in the world by 2016.

Archaeology features such as shell middens,Coastal Shell Middens and Agricultural Origins in Atlantic Europe. discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food. The ancient river Nile was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population.. The Egyptians had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in tomb scenes, drawings, and papyrus documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime. Ancient Israelites The Israelites ate a variety of fresh and saltwater fish, according to both archaeological and textual evidence. Remains of freshwater fish from the Yarkon and Jordan rivers and the Sea of Galilee have been found in excavations, and include St. Peter's fish and mouthbreeders. Saltwater fish discovered in excavations include sea bream, grouper, meager and gray mullet. Most of these come from the Mediterranean, but in the later Iron Age period, some are from the Red Sea. Fishermen supplied fish to inland communities, as remains of fish, including bones and scales, have been discovered at many inland sites. To preserve them for transport, the fish were first smoked or dried and salted. Merchants also imported fish, sometimes from as far as from Egypt, where pickled roe was an export article. Remains of Nile Perch from Egypt have been found, and these must have been smoked or dried, before being imported through the trade network that connected ancient Near Eastern societies. Merchants shipped fish to Jerusalem and there was evidently a significant trade in fish; one of the gates of Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate, named for a fish market nearby.(, , , , ) Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. However, even in the later Persian, Greek and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive. Ancient Greece Fishing scenes are rarely represented in ancient Greek culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably parrotfish) whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive.Dalby, p.67. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish. Ancient Rome Pictorial evidence of Roman fishing comes from mosaics.Image of fishing illustrated in a Roman mosaic . The Greco-Roman sea god Neptune is depicted as wielding a fishing trident. Fish was served only in earlier periods, and it remained more expensive than simpler meat types. Breeding was attempted in freshwater and saltwater ponds, but some kinds of fish could not be fattened in captivity. Among those that could was the formidable and potentially toxic Mediterranean moray, a valued delicacy which were reared in ponds at the seaside.Moray Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, 2012. Accessed 17 May 2012. These morays were also kept as pets and sometimes as a means of punishment. Another farmed species was the popular, mullus, the goatfish. At a certain time this fish was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place in garo, in the sauce. At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why mullus in the feast of Trimalchio (see the Satyricon) could be shown as a characteristic of the parvenu, who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish. The fish and fishing practices of the Roman era were recorded by the Greco-Roman Oppian of Cilicia, whose Halieutics was an expansive poem in hexameter composed between 177 and 180. It is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. Garum, also known as liquamen, was the universal sauce added to everything. It was prepared by subjecting salted fish, in particular mackerel intestines, to a very slow thermal process. Over the course of two to three months, in an enzymatic process stimulated by heating, usually by exposure to the sun, the protein-laden fish parts decomposed almost entirely. The resulting mass was then filtered and the liquid traded as garum, the remaining solids as alec - a kind of savoury spread. Because of the smell it produced, the production of garum within the city was banned. Garum, supplied in small sealed amphorae, was used throughout the Empire and totally replaced salt as a condiment. Today similar sauces are produced in Southeast Asia, usually sold abroad under the description \\"fish sauce\\", or nam pla. Upeneichthys lineatus (Blue-lined goatfish).jpgGoatfish Garumamphoren.JPGTwo amphores for garum China carp on a Ming porcelain pot, AD Aquaculture in China began before the 1st millennium BC with the farming of the common carp. These carp were grown in ponds on silk farms, and were fed silkworm nymphs and faeces.Parker R (2000) Aquaculture science Page 6. Delmar Thomson Learning. Carp are native to China. They are good to eat, and they are easy to farm since they are prolific breeders, do not eat their young, and grow fast. The original idea that carp could be cultured most likely arose when they were washed into ponds and paddy fields during monsoons. This would lead naturally to the idea of stocking ponds.History of aquaculture Retrieved 2 August 2009. The Chinese politician Fan Li was credited with authorship of The Fish- Breeding Classic, [Fan Li]. [Y«éngy√∫ Jƒ´ng, \\"The Fish-Breeding Classic\\"]. the earliest-known treatise on fish farming. During the 7th- to 10th-century Tang dynasty, the farming of common carp was banned because the Chinese word for common carp () sounded like the emperors' family name, Li (). Anything that sounded like the emperor's name could not be kept or killed.Nash CE and Novotny AJ (1995) Production of aquatic animals Page 22, Elsevier Science Ltd. . The ban had a productive outcome, because it resulted in the development of polyculture, growing multiple species in the same ponds. Different species feed on different foods and occupy different niches in the ponds. In this way, the Chinese were able to simultaneously breed four different species of carp, the mud carp, which are bottom feeders, silver carp and bighead carp, which are midwater feeders, and grass carp which are top feeders.FAO (1983) Freshwater aquaculture development in China Page 19, Fisheries technical paper 215, Rome. . Another development during the Tang dynasty was a mutation of the domesticated carp, which led to the development of goldfish. From AD 1368, the Ming Dynasty encouraged fish farmers to supply the live fish trade, which dominates Chinese fish sales to this day.Fisheries of Americas Retrieved 2 August 2009. From 1500, methods of collecting carp fry from rivers and then rearing them in ponds were developed.\\" Japan Bowl of Sushi by Hiroshige, 19th century In Japan, sushi has traditionally been considered a delicacy.

Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Nare-zushi was made of this gutted fish stored in fermented rice for months at a time for preservation. The fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling.Food reference The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for the Japanese. During the Muromachi period, another way of preparing sushi was developed, called namanare. Namanare was partly raw fish wrapped in rice, consumed fresh, before it changed flavor. During the Edo period, a third type of sushi was developed, haya-zushi. Haya-zushi was assembled so that both rice and fish could be consumed at the same time, and the dish became unique to Japanese culture. It was the first time that rice was not being used for fermentation. Rice was now mixed with vinegar, with fish, vegetables and dried foodstuff added. This type of sushi is still very popular today. Each region utilizes local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations. When Tokyo was still known as Edo in the early 1800s, mobile food stalls run by street vendors became popular. During this period nigiri-zushi was introduced, consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over it. After the Great Kanto earthquake in 1923, nigiri-sushi chefs were displaced from Edo throughout Japan, popularizing the dish throughout the country. Indigenous peoples of the Americas The Inuit prepared and buried large amounts of dried meat and fish. Pacific Northwest tribes crafted seafaring dugouts long for fishing. Medieval Europe Fishing lamprey in a stream; Tacuinum Sanitatis, 15th century In medieval Europe, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. \\"Fish\\" to the medieval person was also a general name for anything not considered a proper land-living animal, including marine mammals such as whales and porpoises. Also included were the beaver, due to its scaly tail and considerable time spent in water, and barnacle geese, due to lack of knowledge of where they migrated. Such foods were also considered appropriate for fast days.The rather contrived classification of barnacle geese as fish was not universally accepted. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird-like embryo in them, and the secretary of Leo of Rozmital wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served barnacle goose at a fish-day dinner in 1456; Henisch (1976), pp. 48‚Äì49. Especially important was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, and it was one of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople.Melitta Weiss Adamson, \\"The Greco-Roman World\\" in Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe, p. 11. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey, and trout were common.Adamson (2004), pp. 45‚Äì39. Religious views In Islam, the Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools allow the eating of shellfish, while the Hanafi school does not allow it in Sunni Islam. Nor does the Shi'ite school (Ja'fari) allow it. The Jewish laws of Kashrut forbid the eating of shellfish and eels.Yoreh De'ah - Shulchan-Aruch Chapter 1, torah.org. Retrieved 17 June 2012. According to the King James version of the bible, it is alright to eat finfish, but shellfish and eels are an abomination and should not be eaten.\\"All that are in the waters: all that... hath not fins and scales ye may not eat\\" (Deuteronomy 14:9-10) and are \\"an abomination\\" (Leviticus 11:9-12). Since early times, the Catholic Church has forbidden the practice of eating meat, eggs and dairy products at certain times. Thomas Aquinas argued that these \\"afford greater pleasure as food [than fish], and greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to lust.\\" See also * Food history * History of fishing * Marcus Gavius Apicius - Roman gourmet who lived in the 1st century AD References References *Adamson, Melitta Weiss, Food in Medieval Times.

Ibilaldia is essentially a volunteer walk around a circuit of 5-10 kilometers, that is surrounded by food stands and entertainment, and walkers sometimes make the walk in support of an organization. The money they collect it is used to help the Basque schools in the province of Biscay. It is celebrated too to reinforce Basque culture and language. As a solidary fest, everything is organized by the Ikastolas. Each year a different village is the organizer. Parents, teachers and students help to have everything prepared for the main day.  History  At the end of the 1970s the movement created to promote the use of Basque language in schools grew a lot and started to be structured.

Location The community of Whirlwind includes the headwaters of upper main Big Harts Creek, including the following tributaries: Henderson Branch, Lambert Branch, Bulwark Branch, Brier Branch, Tomblin Branch, and Collins Branch. History Old residence at Whirlwind, WV, 2014 Primary settlers of Upper Hart included the following families: Adams, Blair, Collins, Dalton, Farley, Mullins, Smith, Tomblin, and Workman. According to local legend, some type of skirmish occurred at the mouth of Bulwark during the Civil War. Post Office The last Whirlwind Post Office building, 2014 L.W. Riddle petitioned the Postmaster General in 1908 for the creation of a post office called Zama, located six miles northwest of McCloud Post Office and seven miles south of Dingess. The total population to be supplied with mail was 200. In January 1909, the First Assistant Postmaster General responded in a letter that marked out Zama and replaced it with Whirlwind. The proposed post office was located three miles west of the Norfolk and Western Railway, eight miles east of the Guyandotte River, and twenty feet west of Big Harts Creek. L.W. Riddle became postmaster of Whirlwind on March 31, 1910; he was replaced by Sol Riddle on May 25, 1911. On April 30, 1914, James Mullins was confirmed as postmaster; he assumed charge on May 23, 1914. On April 28, 1938, Lindsey Blair was confirmed as postmaster; he assumed charge on May 11, 1938. Shirley Smith assumed charge on October 23, 1940 and became acting postmaster on October 26, 1940. On October 29, 1940, Shirley Smith requested the post office to be relocated to a spot 5/10 of a mile southeast from the old location, fourteen miles from the Guyandotte River, 100 feet west of Harts Creek, nine miles southwest of Dingess, twelve miles southeast of Verdunville, ten miles north of Harts, and fourteen miles from Logan. She asked the post office be relocated \\"so I can take care of it at my own home.\\" Twenty-eight patrons resided within a one mile radius. Shirley Smith was confirmed as postmaster on December 5, 1940 and assumed charge of the post office on January 1, 1941. Pearl Lowe assumed charge on July 12, 1941. She wrote a letter to the Postmaster General requesting the post office be moved one mile north from its present location. It would be located ten miles from the Guyandotte River, about 40 feet west of Harts Creek, nine miles southwest from Dingess, nine miles south of Verdunville, ten miles away from Chapmanville, and two miles southwest of the county line. Pearl Lowe became acting postmaster on September 19, 1941, was confirmed on November 5, 1941, and assumed charge on January 23, 1942. On July 6, 1942, Pearl Lowe requested the post office be relocated to a new site eleven miles northeast of Harts, nine miles southwest of Dingess, twelve miles southeast of Verdunville, 300 feet east of Harts Creek, and 1/8 mile from the old post office. On July 15, 1944, an unnamed person requested it be relocated 1/4 mile south of the old post office, two miles from Mingo County, about 40 feet east of Harts Creek, thirteen miles east of Guyandotte River, nine miles southwest of Dingess, eleven miles south of Verdunville, ten miles north of Harts, and thirteen miles northeast of Chapmanville. Tema Workman assumed charge of the post office on March 1, 1947. On April 22, 1947, Tema Workman requested the post office be relocated to a site one mile north of its old site. Her letter references Bulwark as another name for the community. The new site would be 8 1/10 miles northeast of Shively, 7 1/2 miles south of Dingess, 9 1/2 miles north of Harts, 10 8/10 miles southeast of Verdunville, and 1 1/2 mile from Mingo County. Tema Workman assumed charge on October 1, 1947. Verlie Smith assumed charge of the post office on November 5, 1949 and served as acting postmaster on November 15, 1949. A November 16, 1949 letter moved the post office once again, this time to a location one mile southeast of the old site, 8 1/2 miles north of Harts, ten miles south of Dingess, 6 1/2 miles east of Shively, fourteen miles west of Kirk, and two miles from the Mingo County line. On March 31, 1951, Ernestine Tomblin assumed charge of the post office and became acting postmaster on April 17, 1951. Whirlwind Post Office was discontinued on January 5, 1952, effective January 31, 1952, mail to Harts. Economy Della Tomblin in her store at Whirlwind, WV Timbering served as the community's primary industry. The community benefited by its close proximity to Dingess, a busy town situated along the Norfolk and Western Railway on Twelve Pole Creek. As recently as the 1990s, the community had a gas station, grocery store, and a kennel. A butcher shop exists on Henderson Branch. Churches Hannah United Baptist Church was established at Whirlwind in the 1950s. The church is named for Hannah (Pack) Tomblin. Hoover Church, relocated from Hoover Fork, is now located in Whirlwind.

Life He was the son and heir of Thomas Dingley, controller of customs at Southampton; he was born about the middle of the seventeenth century, and, on his own account educated by James Shirley, the dramatist, who for some years kept a school in Whitefriars, London. In 1670 he was admitted a student of Gray's Inn. In the following year he became one of the suite of Sir George Downing, then returning as ambassador to the States-General of the United Provinces. Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, as Lord President of Wales, took Dingley with him in 1684 on an official progress. Dingley was made an honorary freeman of the boroughs of Brecknock and Monmouth, wrote and sketched. Dingley lived much at Dilwyn in Herefordshire, when not travelling. From the administration of his effects, granted in May 1695, it is known that he was at Leuven in Flanders when he died. Works Dingley left in manuscript a journal of his Travails through the Low Countreys, Anno Domini 1674, illustrated by sketches in pen and ink. Subsequently, he made a tour in France, and wrote a similar illustrated record of his journey. In 1680 he visited Ireland, perhaps in a military capacity, and the account of what he there saw, and his observations on the history of the country, were published in 1870, as a reprint from the pages of the journal of the Kilkenny and South East of Ireland Archaeological Society. The manuscripts of all these accounts of travel came into the possession of Sir F. S. Winnington of Stanford Court, Worcestershire. Ballycar Castle in western Ireland, sketch by Thomas Dineley. The manuscript of Dingley's journal of the progress in Wales was kept by the Dukes of Beaufort. Part of it, under the title of Notitia Cambro-Britannica, was edited by Charles Baker in 1864, and printed for private circulation by the 8th Duke of Beaufort. A facsimile edition of the whole work, The Account of the Official Progress of His Grace Henry, the First Duke of Beaufort through Wales in 1684 was sponsored by the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1888.The project was arranged by R. W. Banks, the Treasurer of the Association , who supplied the introductory preface to the work. It was published in London by Blades, East and Blades in 1888. The History from Marble, a collection of epitaphs, church notes, and sketches of domestic and other buildings (published by the Camden Society 1867‚Äì1868), ranges over most of the midland and western counties in England. Dingley's notes and sketches were known to Treadway Russell Nash and Theophilus Jones, who made use of them in their histories of Worcestershire and Brecon. The manuscript passed to Sir F. S. Winnington. Dingley's collections also formed the groundwork of Richard Rawlinson's History and Antiquities of the Cathedral Church of Hereford.

The site is owned by the National Trust and the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust owns and manages unit 2, which is called Old London Road reserve.Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al, 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' Location Wotton Hill lies on the Jurassic limestone scarp of the Cotswolds and includes disused quarries. It is an area of woodland, scrub, grassland and old quarries.Natural England citation for Wotton Hill It is to the west of the Coombe Hill SSSI. Woodland Westridge Wood (unit 1) and Conygre Wood (unit 3) are the two main areas of ancient woodland, which are mostly beech. Ash and pedunculate oak are widespread, and other trees include field maple and locally small- leaved lime. Historically the woods were managed as coppice and old stools remain present. The woodland is now high forest with an understorey, and a rich flora which is characteristic of beech woods. Ground flora includes nettle-leaved bellflower, goldenrod, spurge laurel and tutsan. stinking hellebore and wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) may also be found. The site is one of only two United Kingdom sites for the nationally rare limestone woundwort which is found and monitored in Old London Road reserve (unit 2). It is also now reported present in Westridge Wood and Conygre Wood.Natural England SSSI information on the Wotton Hill units Conygre Wood is listed in the 'Cotswold District' Local Plan 2001-2011 (on line).Cotswold District Local Plan, Appendix 2, Key Wildlife Sites Grassland, scrub and quarries The woods are linked by unimproved limestone grassland and scrub. (unit 5). The scrub and grassland in the disused quarries (unit 4) provides a good habitat for butterflies, which include chalkhill blue and brown argus. Geology There are important exposures of rocks of the lower and middle Jurassic Periods. The lowest part of the exposure consists of Cotswold Sand Formation which is overlain by the 'Cephalopod bed'. The 'Cephalopod bed' exposure is relatively thick and contains valuable fossil molluscs ammonites. The 'Cephalopod bed' is overlain by the 'scissum' beds (Leckhampton Limestone) of the Middle Jurassic, Aalenian Stage. The upper exposure consists of lower Inferior Oolite (Fiddler‚Äôs Elbow Limestone and Frocester Hill Oolite). This is overlain by Upper 'Trigonia' Grit. SSSI Source * Natural England SSSI information on the citation * Natural England SSSI information on the Wotton Hill units Old London Road reserve * Natural England SSSI information on Old London Road, Unit 2 =Location= This reserve () is a site on the top of the Cotswold scarp, which is one and a half miles north of Wotton-under-Edge. It was purchased by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust in 1972, primarily to safeguard one of the only two remaining British locations of limestone woundwort. It lies on Inferior Oolitic limestone and is part of a row of small narrow fields known locally as 'The Cupboards'. It lies between the Old London Road and the ancient Conygre Wood; the wood is on the steep-sloping scarp. =Plants= Limestone woundwort is protected under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, and was found in the area in 1897 by Mr C Buckenall. It has not been previously recorded in the United Kingdom. Another site was then discovered in Denbighshire. The plant grows in mountainous regions in central and southern Europe, and its alternative name is alpine woundwort. When the reserve was purchased only a few limestone woundwort plants remained. Dr M Martin (Bristol University) grew some from local seed. These were transplanted into the site. In a good season, a number of flowering spikes can be seen beneath the hedgerow on the site.2011, 'Nature Reserve Guide', Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust for its 50th anniversary The hedgerow supports a diverse woodland flora which includes wood anemone, bluebell, ramsons (wood garlic), nettle-leaved bellflower and wood millet. The hedge comprises hawthorn, buckthorn, dogwood, hazel, ash, spindle and traveller's-joy. The fields support grassland flowers such as common fleabane, agrimony, cuckooflower, marjoram and bulbous buttercup. =Invertebrates and birds= The hedgerow and fields support many butterflies including chalkhill blue and silver-washed fritillary. Birdlife includes long-tailed tit, blackcap and robin. =Conservation= The prime aim is to increase the numbers of limestone woundwort, which are now reported present in the woodland units of the SSSI. Nettles are kept under control and the hedgerow is laid. Meadows are cut in June.

The building Interior Its origins date back to 1792, but it was not until 1843 when the Museum was inaugurated in Madrid. The then Spanish Naval Ministry was provided with a new headquarters in the 1920s, and the museum moved there in 1932. (Until 1977 there were three ministerial portfolios, one for each of the different branches of the Armed Forces: the army, navy, and air force. During the Transici√≥n, Adolfo Su√°rez combined them into one). The architects were Jos√© Espelius and Francisco Javier de Luque. Visitors enter the museum through a modernist facade on the Paseo del Prado, and pass to the first floor where former courtyards (now exhibition halls of the Naval Museum) are covered by spectacular stained-glass roofs with naval and decorative motifs made by Maumejean (a family glass- making business which had a branch in Spain). At weekends a doorway onto the grand staircase of Navy Headquarters is opened to allow visitors to appreciate the architecture. Collections The map of Juan de la Cosa, the earliest preserved map of the Americas, is on permanent display in this museum. Since 2007 the museum has hosted a specimen of moon rock. One of two such samples given to Spain, it was collected on the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. The rock, which weighs one gram, was put on display in 2009, to mark the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing. It was put on display as part of a Nuit Blanche.

The inflorescence is a series of branching stems with clumps of small white, pink, or reddish flowers. Eriogonum heracleoides, the parsnipflower buckwheat Native American groups had several medicinal uses for this plant. It was used as a remedy for colds and cuts.Eriogonum niveum. University of Michigan Ethnobotany. The roots of this plant and Eriogonum heracleoides were brewed into a tea which was taken to treat diarrhea. This plant grows on grassy plains, sagebrush deserts, and ponderosa pine forests mainly east of the Cascade Range. It is a pioneer species, taking hold in thin, dry soils where other plants have not yet established. Other plants in the habitat may include Artemisia tridentata, Purshia tridentata, Juniperus occidentalis, Pseudoroegneria spicata, Sporobolus airoides, Elymus wawawaiensis, Poa secunda, Achnatherum hymenoides, and Nassella comata.

He is generally recognized as the father of \\"Direct Response\\" radio advertising.  Early career  Upon his graduation from East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania with a degree in health and physical education, Catona became a high school health-science teacher and athletics coach. As a child, he dreamed of one day owning his own sandwich shop. In an effort to realize his dream and also further support his family, he opened ‚ÄúThe Country Grocer‚Äù located in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. In 1983, as his business thrived, Catona saw a void that up to this time had not been filled. Having been raised in Philadelphia, a city known for many local food specialties, he started a mail-order food company called \\"A Taste of Philadelphia\\". The first of its kind anywhere, ‚ÄúA Taste of Philadelphia‚Äù afforded people around the world the opportunity to send or receive a gift package complete with such delicacies as cheesesteaks, hoagies (submarine sandwiches), soft pretzels, Tastykakes, and many other food items not easily found outside the Philadelphia area. Also in that year, Catona made national headlines for attempting to be the first to ever send a Philadelphia hoagie into space. He contacted astronaut Guion S. Bluford Jr., a Philadelphia-area native and first African-American in space, asking if he would take one of Catona's hoagies on board the space shuttle Challenger for mission STS-8 that would be taking place in August of that year. After spending for two years with researches and microbiologists from Widener University to develop a hoagie safe for space travel, it was decided by NASA that due to its size and many ingredients, a Philadelphia hoagie would not be a part of that particular space mission. Life after mail-order =Radio Direct Response= In promoting his mail-order business, he realized the tremendous power that radio had for selling his product. Specifically, he found incredible success giving radio interviews in exchange for advertising by way of commercials and promotional giveaways. As a result of this success, he developed a direct-response format for radio advertising. Before long, businesses in the infomercial industry began to take notice of Catona's methods and asked for his help getting their message to a larger audience. As more businesses asked for his help, Catona, in 1993, decided to start ‚ÄúRadio Direct Response‚Äù, the first advertising agency focusing solely on direct response radio marketing. As the success of ‚ÄúRadio Direct Response‚Äù grew, he was approached by entrepreneur Jay Walker with an idea for a new website where consumers could name their own price for airline tickets. Tapping William Shatner as a celebrity spokesperson, Catona developed a campaign for this new website, now called Priceline.com. Within just the first 18 months of its inception, Priceline.com went on to generate 1 billion dollars using direct- response radio alone. Some of Catona's other achievements have included launching FreeCreditReport.com and many other multimillion-dollar companies. = Direct response radio marketing = Others since the 1920s have used direct response radio marketing but no full service (strategize offer, write commercials, produce the commercial, place the media and track response of how many people called or sent in money) agency was created until 1995 that strictly promoted the use of direct response radio marketing. The principals of direct response radio marketing are similar to all types of direct response marketing ‚Äì direct offer to purchase direct from the manufacture, no middle man or broker. The theory is that because there is no middle men there will be lower pricing. For example, it is a common practice for a retail store to double the price for want they paid for a product before selling it to the public. Also chances are the retailer did not buy the product from a manufacture but rather from a broker who also had a mark-up on the product. Direct response radio marketing usually works directly with manufacturers. = Catona today = Catona was the founder and chief marketing strategist of Bulldozer Digital, an advertising agency utilizing both direct response radio advertising and Catona's newest development called ‚ÄúDigital Convergence Marketing‚Äù, which generates leads to maintain contact with clients potential customers.

It is a London borough council, one of 32 in the United Kingdom capital of London. Wandsworth is divided into 20 wards, each electing three councillors. After the May 2018 election, 33 of these councillors were Conservatives and 26 were Labour, with 1 independent. The Conservatives have had an overall majority on the council since 1978. History A map showing the wards of Wandsworth since 2002 There have previously been a number of local authorities responsible for the Wandsworth area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the London Borough of Wandsworth on 1 April 1965. Wandsworth replaced the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea and the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, but excluding the former parish of Clapham and most of the former parish of Streatham which were transferred to the London Borough of Lambeth. It was envisaged through the London Government Act 1963 that Wandsworth as a London local authority would share power with the Greater London Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \\"wide area\\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for \\"personal\\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Wandsworth London Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. Wandsworth became an education authority in 1990. Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a \\"most purpose\\" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions. From 1992 to 2011, Wandsworth was an early adopter of 'Thatcherite' policies of privatisation of street cleaning and refuse collection, and sale of council housing, under the leadership of Edward Lister. Between 2007 and 2010 only 11% of the \\"affordable\\" homes built in Wandsworth were for social rent - the lowest in the whole of London. Many ex-council homes became owned by concentrated and absent private landlords. However Wandsworth became the most successful value for money local authority in the country, with the country's lowest council tax charge and top satisfaction ratings from its residents. As of 2019 Wandsworth council tax remained the lowest in the UK, which the council ascribed to continued cost focus. Powers and functions The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation. Wandsworth has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. It is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. The council shares responsibility with the Greater London Authority for strategic policies including housing, planning and the environment. Finances Wandsworth London Borough Council is the billing authority for Council Tax, and collects a precepts on behalf of the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. Summary results of elections The Labour Party won the first election in 1964, and also in 1971 and 1974. The Conservative Party has been in power since 1978.

It was originally known as the Atkinson Memorial Clock Tower and sits in solitary on the bluff along Signal Hill Road overlooking this seaside city and capital of Sabah, Malaysia.The history of the Atkinson Clock Tower, Heritage Sabah.  History  Atkinson Clock Tower, . The clock tower was built in the memory of Francis George Atkinson, Jesselton's first district officer who died of Malaria or ‚ÄòBorneo Fever‚Äô at the age of 28 in December 1902. His mother Mrs Mary Edith Atkinson presented a two-faced clock to Jesselton town as a tribute to the memory of her son and it was decided later that a clock tower would be built in his honour. The structure was commissioned on 20 April 1905. A road was also named after him ‚Äì Atkinson Drive, now renamed as Jalan Istana that links Tuaran Road over the ridge and downtown Kota Kinabalu.Stella Moo (2005) The Atkinson Memorial Clock Tower - Commemorating its Centenary, Sabah Society Journal Vol 22(2005) The clock tower was originally built using Mirabau wood. Its construction was financed by Atkinson's friends and most probably built with additional funds channelled from shipwright of visiting naval vessels (the internal carpentry of the clock tower has all the hallmarks of a ship's carpenter). While still under construction the clock started working on 19 April 1905 and its chimes could be heard all over the town. The structure was finally completed in 1905. The clock was made by William Potts and Sons in Leeds, England. The company was established in 1883 and became the part of Smith of Derby Group in 1933. The UK office is now at 112 Alfreton Road, Derby. Measuring 50 feet (15.24 metres) high x 6‚Äô3‚Äù x 6‚Äô3‚Äù at its base the clock tower stood from its lookout point on the hill facing towards the township of Jesselton. A weather vane with initials of the wind direction added a few more inches to the height of this elegant monument. Ships calling port at the wharf used the Atkinson Clock Tower as their navigation landmark, as it could be seen from the sea. The clock tower was illuminated at night and was used as a shipping landmark right up to the 1950s.  Function  Atkinson Clock Tower seen at night. It is hard to imagine how this relatively small but historical clock tower, standing on its own on this hill could ever be any ship's point of reference; after 105 years, the narrow strip of land in front of the tower has been extensively reclaimed, with tall commercial buildings blocking the views of the clock tower to the sea. But one has only to look at early photos of Jesselton township from its formation in the 1900s to present day to see how vital the clock tower was as a reference point ‚Äì and still is ‚Äì as a marker for the growth of this quaint former British Colony township known as 'Jesselton' into 'Kota Kinabalu' - the bustling modern Malaysian city that it is now. Radio Sabah's broadcasting department used to be located near the clock tower in the 1950s and some old timers still remember the chimes over the radio before the BBC world news broadcast.  Repair and renovation  Over the years, the clock tower underwent many transformations. Subsequent repairs and renovations have altered its appearance. Machine-gun fire during the war damaged the dial and cog of the clock tower's mechanisms. It was repaired by Yick Ming Watch Dealers of Kota Kinabalu who have continued to be the maintenance contractors until today, a practice passed down from father to son. Therefore, the story of this historical clock tower is intricately tied to the lives of generations of Sabahans who have lived in its vicinity over the past one hundred years. The clock tower was extensively renovated and altered for Jesselton's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 1959. Defective structural members caused by the tropical weather were substituted with other hardwoods, while the roof timbers were stripped and replaced. Its new facelift was completed on 7 November 1959. However, the brass plaque that was placed at the foot of the clock disappeared after the Jubilee renovations. In 1961, the Atkinson Clock Tower's clock face was altered yet again. The dials of the clock were changed and the face replaced with translucent Perspex, with black figures on white background for internal lighting. But the building itself has remained intact in its exact location for more than a century.  Gazetted  The clock tower is protected under the Sabah Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Enactment 1997 and its Antiquities and Treasure Trove Enactment 1977; with its site was gazetted in 1983. In May 2012, the clock tower was repaired again. The Daily Express made a complaint in July 2016 on the clock tower malfunction; which were responded by Sabah Museum to repair it. On 23 February 2018, it is one of 24 heritage sites in the state that were gazetted by Sabah's State Heritage Council under new enactment of \\"State Heritage Enactment 2017\\".  Issues  = Impact from proposed development = In 2011, it was reported that developers intend to use the land located closely to the clock tower for malls development; leading to a protest by various heritage protectors and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as the structures would completely overshadow the historical tower. This resulted the plan being shelved. However the plan was returned in mid-2017 when the Sabah state government gave permission to the developer with a proposal to relocate the clock tower to a new site. Kota Kinabalu City Hall (DBKK) have stressed that they did not have the power to relocate the tower to another place and said any approvals made by DBKK have to go through the state government. Malaysian Architect Association (PAM) have strongly voiced their opposition to the state government decision and said any heritage sites that have been gazetted in the state should be treasured and protected.

Police stations, Circle office, sub-divisional police offices, district police offices, campus networks at COP, CID, Chief office and other offices of special units. It has been brought under CCTNS now. The software comprises 12 modules over which MIS is overlaid to support different workflows and their interdependence in regular policing. It has identified 64 end users who have different roles in the day to day policing work and user interfaces catering to their individual needs have been created. The software could generate 417 different reports which help in supervision, the ultimate aim being to support the executive in policy-making, saving much time in surveying and paper work. Currently the software is in the verge of integration with seven other legacy systems in different departments of the Karnataka Government so that the whole of policing could go digital in the days to come. Background Several initiatives have been introduced in the past to leverage IT in police functioning. Some of these include central government initiated programs such as the NCRB-led CCIS (Crime and Criminals Information System) and CIPA (Common Integrated Police Application), and State-led initiatives such as e-COPS in Andhra Pradesh, Thana Tracking System in West Bengal, CAARUS in Tamil Nadu and HD IITS in Gujarat. In 2008 CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems) was conceived as a Mission Mode Project fully sponsored by the Government of India under the National e-Governance Plan to provide a comprehensive integrated application platform and a nationwide networked environment for sharing real time crime and criminal information across more than 15000 Police stations, nearly 6000 higher offices of the country. Since all these systems were standalone in nature covering only processes regarding Crime in general, a strong need was felt to create a comprehensive system supporting all the police requirements in the state and the Karnataka state police has come up with Police IT as its ERP for policing. Objectives The reports generated and the workflows included are designed considering the following objectives *Help executive in Planning by easy access to information and real time statistics generation *Optimum Staffing of men by deploying them for core tasks *Effective Direction and Control by higher offices *Improved Coordination between various offices *Customized Reporting by generation of a wide range of reports *Reduction in paper work and manual register maintenance Technology The Police IT software is built on .NET 2.0 framework on Windows 2008 Enterprise Server. Database interface has been built using ADO.NET. Data storage is UNICODE based resulting in comprehensive support of Kannada, the official language of the state. Reports have been developed using Crystal Reports and transmission is in Adobe PDF Document. Database layer is developed using MS SQL 2005. MPLS is used to connect the major LANs at District Police Office (DPO), Commissioner of Police (COP offices), Crime Investigation Department (CID), Chief's Office etc. through a 2-4 Mbps MPLSnetwork to the State Police Data Center at Madiwala. VPNoBB connects all other locations inclusive of all police stations with a 512- 2048kbit/s bandwidth to the State Police Data Center. A central aggregation bandwidth of 155 Mbps, fiber optic MPLS connects the Data Center to the whole state. Work Flow Modules The Police IT software application has been divided into 12 modules with different workflows with the facility of exporting data across modules along with the possibility of generating reports with information across different modules. The core functions of policing are incorporated in Crime, Law & Order and Traffic modules. The three modules namely Finance, Administration and Stores provide the administrative support required for the department. Armed, Motor Transport and Training modules provide the ancillary support and the Wireless and the FSL are technical modules. The functionalities of these modules are achieved from inception till conclusion in each case by providing users at different levels in hierarchy with different rights to update and supervise by role based access. The whole application in its journey towards a paperless office helps the police which is a documentation intensive department do away with hundreds of records the maintenance of which is both manpower intensive and time consuming. =Crime= This module facilitates the collection of detailed information about the history of the crime and criminals and assists in investigation process. It allows for capturing of crime data from the time of registration of First Information Report and monitors the case even after conviction. In addition it allows generation of a comprehensive account of the crime. Workflow of crime module The workflow for crime process starts with registration of First Information Report which can be done by an SHO and then the case can be investigated by him on his own or assigned/transferred to another investigating officer. In property offences, details of property have to be entered and classification of crime is required for report generation at later point of time under different heads. The investigating officer then starts a case diary detailing the progress of the case. The Investigating Officer, on completion of the investigation files the charge sheet or final report in the court of jurisdiction. Court progress of these cases are noted till disposal and on disposal, if the accused is convicted, conviction memo is prepared and then the case may go for appeal. The application captures all the details in each of these processes under different components of the crime module such as FIR, Case Assignment, Crime Classification, Case Diary, Crime Details, Property Seizure, Property Movement, Arrest and Court Surrender memo, Bail Bond, Remand Application, Witness Details, Charge Sheet, Court Progress Diary, Court Disposal, Conviction Memo, Result of Appeal, MOB (Modus operandi Bureau), BCR(a), BCR(b)History sheet, Case Transfer, and FSL (Forensic Science Labaratory Request). Similar workflow based components are designed in all the modules to cater to the respective services. =Law and Order= This module collates data relating to activities involved in facilitating maintenance of law and order in the state. It is subdivided into Law and order activities, Intelligence and Foreigners‚Äô registration modules. Law and order activities are mainly carried out at police station level while Intelligence and Foreigners‚Äô registration module will be used at District and Commissioner‚Äôs districts. =Traffic= This module covers various activities of law and order issue related to traffic. This captures and collates data relating to accidents and enforcement of IMV Act (Indian Motor Vehicles Act 1988) and fine collection. The module generates 53 reports related to the traffic incidents, accidents and violations based on various criteria like age of vehicle and driver and accident prone areas which help in perspective planning for better traffic management and avoiding accidents. This module in future is expected to be integrated with BTRAC, the Bangalore Traffic Police‚Äô technology-driven traffic-management system and Black Berry systems for a totally digitized traffic control system across the state. =Finance= This module covers information pertaining to the budget and expenditure of the department which includes financial transactions like payables to various vendors, loans to police personnel =Administration= This module helps in managing the activities related to police administration in an orderly manner and gives brief or comprehensive reports as required. The module supports personnel administration related activities. Business processes covered under this module cover the entire period of engagement of the police personnel with the department starting from recruitment till retirement through maintenance of service records, transfers, leave, punishments, promotions, retirement and into pension initiation. =Stores= The Stores module takes care of stocks, purchases, indent, issues of all items used in Police Department such as General Items, Motor Vehicles, Wireless Instruments, FSL Instruments, Arms and Ammunition, Vehicle Spare parts, Fuel, Oil and Lubricants and properties like land, building and quarters. The details pertaining to kit articles are also maintained. =Armed Reserve (AR)= The state police reserve includes State Reserve Police, City Armed Reserves and District Armed reserves. They supplement the regular police in the maintenance of law and order. The module captures details of deployment of platoons and personnel at various places for performing law and order duties from the state, district and city reserve. This module, apart from helping in administration and maintenance related activities of reserve police personnel, assists the higher authorities in getting the details of availability of platoons in various reserve police units at any point of time which acts as an important input in planning deployment of available platoons. Armory is generally located in the District Armed reserve and also the State reserve police has its own Armory in many cases. Armory is a sub module in the Armed reserve module of police IT which captures the details of the issue and return of all weapons and ammunition to the men and maintains the details stock of all weapons and ammunition at various levels and places and also captures the details of firing practice. =Motor Transport (MT)= This module maintains the history of the vehicles of the police department throughout the lifetime from procuring and maintenance till disposal or condemnation. The comprehensive coverage includes maintenance of history sheets, capturing of day-to-day activities of vehicles, drivers, fuel consumption, petrol bunk transactions and regular inspections. This module eliminates the maintenance more than 15 kinds of forms and other records and also eliminates the time in formal communication for vehicle repairs, maintenance and overhauls. =Training= Various state and national level academies, institutes and units provide training to officers of all ranks, and other police and clerical personnel. The courses offered vary from induction courses to refresher and theme courses. This module covers all the activities relating to handling of these courses at various institutes and units along with library management activities like book keeping and issuing. Details related to on the job training provided to personnel at all levels is captured in this module =Wireless= This module captures operations of the police wireless and control room and includes information relating to both equipment maintenance and operations. The operations include maintenance of wireless log, transmission of approved messages, message logs, etc. and equipment maintenance includes maintenance of registers related to purchase, usage and repairs. =Forensic Science Lab (FSL)= FSL is the testing laboratory of the police department with its laboratories at national and state levels which conducts various tests on the requests coming from the police department and other Government departments. This module captures the administrative functionality of the FSL Unit as a whole. This involves capturing and maintaining the information of the cases registered in FSL on request from police station or otherwise, flow of the case through the different sections in FSL, status of the case at each point of time till its final disbursement back to the requested unit. It also captures the various other day-to-day activities of FSL like scene of crime requisition, court duty attendance and ammunition and equipment usage. =MIS= Management Information system module is the dashboard of Police IT. This dashboard gives all the details in a tabular and graphical format pertaining to all modules of Police IT. =KGSC Services= Apart from functionalities in these modules, the software also caters to capturing of the details of petitions and other requests that come under the purview of the police department as identified by the Karnataka Guarantee of Services to Citizens‚Äô Act 2011 which specifies timelines and standards for the services to be provided to citizens by the government agencies including law enforcement departments. KSPWAN KSPWAN is the Karnataka State Police Wide Area Network created exclusively for facilitating real time exchange of information among smaller computer networks prevalent at DPOs, campus networks at COP, CID, Chief office etc. and all other locations such as Police Stations, Circles, SDPOs, and other offices of special units by integrating them into one network. This network presently caters to the information exchange within the department but intends to create a wider network bringing all other departments related with policing as a part of the same network. Currently the network includes *906 Police Stations *234 Circle Offices *129 Sub-Divisional Police Offices *30 District Police Offices *6 Range Offices *6 Regional Forensic Laboratories *12 Karnataka State Reserve Police Battalions *1 Railways Police Unit *1 Police Headquarters *1 State Crime Record Bureau *Special Units Legacy Systems These are digitized modules which are already functional in certain wings in police department and in various departments of the Karnataka government catering to different requirements of administration. =E-Beat= It is the new system of Beat service adopted by Karnataka Police with an aim to introduce technology for ensuring accountability and efficiency. The system uses radio frequency based technology to perform beat service, wherein in place of the Point books in the Beat area, an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Tag is installed; the RFID Tag contains a microchip with a unique identifier stored on it. This unique identifier can only be read using a RFID Reader which operates at a similar frequency. The information regarding the beat constables performing the beat, the beat no to which it should be used for beat service, the beat point locations to be visited is fed into it before assigning it to the beat constable and deployed. The beat constables carry the reader to the beat, read the unique ids from the beat point location, complete the beat and return the reader to the Station House Officer with a detailed report along with it. The SHO will download the contents from the reader which is basically the date and time of visit to a beat point along with name and designation of the person who visited the beat points. The system ensures physical presence of the police personnel on beat which itself is a deterrent for unlawful activities. Also the system keeps track of manpower utilization and assists the SHO in devising strategies for crime prevention and monitoring of human resources. The e-beat application provides various reports which assist the SHO in keeping track of the offences and correlate with the beat performance and crime occurrence. =GCARE= GIS Based Crime Analysis and Reporting Engine is a desktop-based Geographic Information System (GIS) developed for State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB), Karnataka State Police by the Karnataka State Remote Sensing Applications Centre (KSRSAC). With this application, the information stored in the Crime Criminal Information System (CCIS) database can be viewed against spatial background over a map. The main functionalities in G-CARE are Crime mapping, Crime Analysis, Village Analysis and Hotspot Analysis. The Data Capture involves creation of point data by capturing each and every FIR number on the correct location of the map. In Crime analysis, the CCIS data queried according to user defined criteria are displayed on the map with help of graphical symbols. In village analysis the information about a location and its sensitivity will be displayed on the map with graphics. Hotspot Analysis involves identifying spots of repeated occurrence of a particular crime over a district boundary. G-CARE allows viewing of all the police station boundaries, their subsequent circles and subdivisions up to the district level. A module has also been developed to monitor and display the areas spatially, affected by illegal mining/quarrying along with the villages affected by the rampant usage of illicit liquor. The system retrieves information which helps to analyze the situation which in turn will help easy and fast decision making in SCRB. =Black Berry= This is an initiative of the Bangalore traffic police which brings together all aspects of operational traffic policing in one unified system. The Bangalore traffic police Officers are provided with a Black Berry Smart phone and a Bluetooth printer and they can access the history of any driver and vehicle and issue challans on the spot to offenders. The system is capable of pulling out data from more than two million cases in less than two minutes. Vigilance is also observed through video cameras set up at different traffic signals and the traffic staff at the control room continuously update the database of offenders‚Äô vehicles monitoring the footage recorded. Online booking of violations using Black Berry and video monitoring also ensures tracking of habitual offenders and unpaid violation notices issued in the past. The system has resulted in better traffic management and increased revenue and has been replicated by the Hyderabad Traffic Police in Andhra Pradesh. =Dial 100= It is the Public Distress Response system which uses GSM, Wireless Media, and Computer based Command and control from Police control room, multiple vehicle mount terminals and GIS based navigation and guidance. On receipt of complaint / grievance from public by Dial 100 to Control Room, an incident report is generated and is transferred to the dispatcher electronically in real time. The wireless operator/dispatcher assesses the incident report along with all details of complaint, address, telephone number and scene of crime and GIS map (Digital Map) of the city / locality to help dispatcher to see the address on the map for the incident. GPS based Vehicle tracking system displays the real time availability of the PCR(Police Control Room) vehicles which will respond to the emergency call. The dispatcher based on above information will instantaneously transfer the incident report to the identified Patrol van on to its Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) for attending to the emergency and the system enables the dispatcher to monitor the patrol van in real time on his computer. After successfully attending the emergency calls the system /dispatcher closes the event. The calls handled by the Police control room are fully monitored and stored in computer systems to facilitate the response process to be computerized. =Automated Finger Print Identification System (AFIS)= It is a software used to capture and search Finger Prints of suspects, arrested and convicted persons. The software facilitates search of ten digit finger prints of arrested and suspected persons and chance prints developed at crime scene by FP Experts. It uses Minutiae based search after converting the fingerprints available on ten-digit F.P. slips and lifted chance prints to their digital form. Since it is a Minutiae based search even the most partial chance prints not having delta or core i.e., complete pattern, are successfully searched on the entire database of AFIS and the search results are offered with great speed and fool-proof accuracy. The Karnataka State Police installed an imported portable live scan device in various police stations in the State under the Police Modernization scheme for obtaining ten-digit fingerprints of arrested and convicted persons at Police station level and to get the search results on-line from the jurisdiction finger print units/central AFIS server within the least possible time limit. At present each District FP Unit is connected to the DPO via network and also the central AFIS server installed in State FPB, to facilitate fast & accurate search of ten prints and chance prints on-line and communication of search results within few minutes. =e-Procurement= This is the digital platform created by the department of e-governance for facilitating the process of procurement of supplies/ work/ services to all government departments. The e-procurement value chain consists of suppliers/vendors registration, indent management, E-tendering, e-auctioning, catalogue management, and contract management. More than 400 suppliers/vendors have enrolled through the website after fulfilling qualifying criteria to participate in the e-tendering. The departments and their sub-units opting for e-procurement have to register themselves with the Centre for e-governance. When a tender is published on the e-procurement portal, it gets notified to all the vendors along with different dates, cut off dates in the process. The department can receive bids in the electronic form which will be saved in an encrypted format. A total of 24 government departments including the Karnataka state police are utilizing this service =HRMS= This is the web-based application merging basic HR activities and processes with Information technology. Currently it is rolled out in the entire state and is generating salary bills of more than five lakh employees of all categories and pay scales like State, Centre, UGC, AICTE, Judicial etc. and is also maintaining employee service history. The HRMS system takes care of the two main functions Service Record Maintenance and Payroll Generation of employees. The Payroll module automates the pay process by gathering data on employee time and attendance, calculating various deductions and taxes, and generating periodic pay cheques and employee tax reports. The pay bill is then submitted to Treasury for payment. The SR(Service Record) or maintenance function covers all other HR aspects from recording the details of new employee joining service to his retirement. The system records basic demographic and address data, training and development, capabilities and skills management records and other related activities. =Khajane= The Online Treasury Project of the Karnataka State Government is a Government-to- government (G2G) project which computerizes all the 216 Treasury offices in Karnataka and is connected to a central server at the State Secretariat. A citizen interface is provided for service pensions and Social security pensions which is an exception to its G2G nature. The entire treasury activity can be tracked through this system from the time of approval of the state Budget to the point of rendering accounts to the government. The applications being supported by the system presently are payments, receipts, deposits, pensions, stamps, social security pensions and report generation etc. =GPS based Automatic Vehicle Location System (AVLS)= GPS based Automatic Vehicle Location System (AVLS) is an electronic device installed in a vehicle to enable the owner or a third party to track the vehicle's location and also receive additional information about vehicle. Karnataka state police has taken a decision to equip all their deployment vehicles, especially those of the Karnataka State Reserve Police(KSRP) and district armed reserve with AVLS. This enables police officials to find out the deployment location of any vehicle in real time. By this senior officials can supervise deployment effectively as well as can deploy the nearest police vehicle in case of law and order situations or any other emergencies and this would ensure faster police presence whenever required. Deployment Team The application is deployed by the SCRB Police IT team. The team monitors the training, deployment, implementation and hand holding tasks related to Police IT. A team is also constituted in every unit under the overall leadership of the Unit Officer which consists of the officers and officials of various levels to deploy the application in their concerned units. The table shows the deployment status of each of the modules and some of the important sub components. Challenges The project was started from scratch and faced different challenges at different stages. Due to the lack of skilled manpower and the nature of works being multifaceted in nature the requirement validation had proved a difficult task and identification of processes and workflows was another big task. Then the bureaucratic resistance to change and the need for giving technical training to semi-skilled manpower had been biggest problems in implementation. The project currently being under phased deployment, duplication of works is another problem. The coordination with other departments which are comparatively less digitized is another major problem currently being faced by the department. Rewards and recognitions Mr. Suresh P, Police Inspector and Mr.Raja Imam Kasim, Police Inspector of SCRB were honored with the Karnataka Chief Minister's Medal for Meritorious Service for remarkable contribution in the field of Capacity Building for Police IT Central e-Mission Team of CCTNS project has recognized the utility of the software and has requested for sharing of the source code. Way forward Integration of Police IT Project with Legacy Systems and CCTNS has been approved by the state government and is in progress under the Challenge Fund Scheme established to support innovative ideas in technology by the state government. Provision of digital signature to officers at different levels and persuading other departments like judiciary and revenue departments to go online to accept the reports of the police online forms next priority after integration with CCTNS. The state government has expressed its willingness to provide technical support to the center and other states in their efforts at digitizing their respective policing processes and departments.

He studied for a medical degree at the University of Zurich and studied psychiatry at Burgh√∂lzli, the University of Zurich's psychiatric hospital. He then studied psychoanalysis under Sigmund Freud in Vienna before moving back to Warsaw in 1921 and translating Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis into Polish. During his career, he wrote a large number of books on psychoanalysis including Evil in Man: The Anatomy of Hate and Violence and Dictators and Disciples from Caesar to Stalin. The latter looks specifically at Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Maximilien Robespierre, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. The psychoanalyst Frank M. Lachmann describes Bychowski as not being a traditional Freudian: \\"Here was a Freudian analyst who was clearly more interested in connecting with the patient and finding areas of strength than in demonstrating how clever he could be in eliciting psychopathology\\". Lachmann writes that Bychowski eventually adopted similar views to that of Heinz Kohut. Amongst his patients was noted American filmmaker James Toback.https://deadline.com/2011/08/james-toback-on-the-gambler-remake- rudeness-and-disrespect-164341/  Selected bibliography  * Specialized Techniques in Psychotherapy (ed. with J.

He was one of the inventors and developers of the life-saving method called oral rehydration therapy for adults and children suffering fluid loss from cholera and other infectious diarrheal illnesses. It is estimated that his work has saved around 50 million people suffering from dehydration. In the past decade, he has conducted research on tobacco control, particularly examining once-secret, now publicly available tobacco industry documents. In retirement he devotes himself to writing and publishing poetry and literary book reviews.  Life and education  Hirschhorn was born in Vienna, Austria in 1938. He escaped the Nazi regime with his parents to London, where they spent the war until immigrating to the United States. He has three children from his first marriage: Elisabeth Hirschhorn Donahue, John Hirschhorn and Robert Hirschhorn. Hirschhorn grew up in New York, attending the Bronx High School of Science. He graduated from Columbia College, Columbia University in the City of New York in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts, and later received his medical degree at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1962. He specialized in internal medicine with internship and residencies at Boston City Hospital, Harvard II and IV medical services (1962‚Äì64, 1967‚Äì8), and gained certification in 1970 from the American Board of Internal Medicine. Hirschhorn joined the US Public Health Service in 1964, and was assigned to the Pakistan-Seato Cholera Research Laboratory, Dacca, East Pakistan (now the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Control, Bangladesh), where he conducted research on cholera and other diarrheal diseases and demonstrated the proof of concept of oral rehydration therapy.  Career  After a post- doctoral fellowship from the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Disease in electrophysiology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Hospital in Boston (1968‚Äì1970), he was appointed Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine at Baltimore City Hospital, and Lecturer, Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health (1970‚Äì1973). In that time, he introduced oral rehydration therapy on the White River Apache Indian Reservation with a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It was demonstrated that children would voluntarily drink as much of the solution as needed to restore hydration; and that rehydration and early re-feeding would protect their nutrition. Wide application of the therapy in both clinical and non-clinical settings resulted. From that work, Hirschhorn established the clinical physiology of rehydration in children. In 1978, Joel Lamstein and Hirschhorn founded John Snow, Incorporated (JSI), named after the father of epidemiology, John Snow, and initially launched as a small for-profit business focused on health care in the United States. In 1980, the organization began working internationally, with Hirschhorn serving as Vice-President of the International Division. From 1983 to 1991, JSI implemented the USAID-Ministry of Health sponsored National Control of Diarrheal Diseases Project in Egypt. Country-wide implementation of oral rehydration therapy and other control measures dramatically reduced child mortality. From 1990‚Äì1993, with a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization team, Hirschhorn conducted research on pesticide poisoning in Indonesian farmers. From 1993 to 1995, Hirschhorn was Visiting Professor of Public Health at the University of Minnesota. He then left JSI to join the Minnesota Department of Health, directing the Division of Family Health (1995‚Äì1998). Between 1998‚Äì2005, he served as lecturer at the Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health; Visiting Senior Lecturer and Consultant, Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Beirut, Lebanon; Visiting Lecturer, Princeton University, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs; and Visiting Researcher at the National Public Health Institute in Finland. In those intervening years, he also served as a consultant to the World Health Organization Tobacco-Free Initiative, conducting research on tobacco industry documents. Several seminal papers were produced. Since his retirement, Hirschhorn has published several essays on the life and illnesses of famous personalities of the 19th century. He writes book reviews, and has published five collections of poetry. He splits his time between Lebanon and London.  Achievements  For his work in oral rehydration therapy, Hirschhorn was recognized by President William J. Clinton at a White House ceremony in 1993 as an \\"American Health Hero\\"; received the Charles A. Dana Foundation Award for Pioneering Achievement in Health in 1990; and the Pollin Prize for Pediatric Research in 2002.

Since DeLuna's execution by lethal injection in 1989, doubts have been raised about the conviction and the question of his guilt.Andrew Cohen, \\"Yes, America, We Have Executed an Innocent Man\\", The Atlantic Monthly, May 14, 2012. An investigation published by the Columbia Human Rights Law Review in May 2012 has strengthened these claims of innocence by detailing a large amount of evidence suggesting the actual murderer was Carlos Hernandez, a similar-looking man who lived in a nearby neighborhood. Crime Carlos DeLuna was charged with killing a gas station attendant, 24-year-old Wanda Lopez, on the evening of February 4, 1983, in Corpus Christi, Texas. The young woman died from multiple stab wounds, apparently from a buck knife. Lopez was killed while on the phone with the police, having just called 911 to report a suspicious person who turned out to be her killer. The crime was particularly senseless because, according to the 911 tape, Lopez seemed to be giving her attacker the money at the time she was stabbed, saying \\"You want it? I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'm not going to do nothing to you. Please!!!\\" =Eyewitnesses= The crime was observed by two eyewitnesses. The first, Kevan Baker, had stopped for gas at the Shamrock gas station. As he approached the office to ask the attendant to activate the pumps, he saw an unshaven man in a flannel shirt inside the gas station struggling with Lopez and trying to drag her by her hair to the back of the station. The man apparently saw Baker, as he released Lopez and headed out of the station, coming face-to-face with Baker. Sergeant Steve Fowler reported that Baker said the man told him, \\"I got a gun. Get back,\\"Police Report at 000004 but Baker testified in court the man simply said, \\"Don't mess with me.\\" Baker then reported the man ran away from the store, the exact direction in which he ran being a source of debate given conflicting wording from various reports. In his police report, Sergeant Fowler reported that Baker told him the attacker \\"ran east from the store.\\" Baker testified at the trial that the attacker \\"ran in an easterly direction.\\" On the other hand, Sergeant Olivia Escobedo's report indicated Baker had said the man \\"fled off behind the station.\\"Police Report at 000016 The original police radio alert from the scene (from Sergeant Bruno Mejia) reported the suspect was \\"northbound on foot, to the rear\\" of the store. Police also reported several other bystanders saying they'd seen a man \\"running to the rear of the store.\\" Baker then saw Lopez staggering out of the station saying \\"help me, help me\\" before she slumped to the ground. Baker attempted to help her, and went inside the station to grab some paper towels to stanch the bleeding until the police and paramedics arrived. George Aguirre also witnessed the attack. Aguirre stopped for gas at the Shamrock station at approximately 8 p.m. As he was filling his van with gas, he saw a man standing just outside the gas station store, wearing either \\"blue pants\\" and a \\"long- sleeved T-shirt\\", or dark pants and a white shirt with sleeves rolled up. The man was drinking beer and playing with a knife like the one used to kill Lopez. Nervous about the knife, Aguirre watched the man closely as he pumped his gas. The man approached Aguirre and asked for a ride to the Casino Club, a local bar. The man offered to pay for the ride and showed Aguirre a black wallet containing a \\"few\\" bills inside. Aguirre declined, but was concerned about the knife, so when he went inside to pay for his gas he told the cashier, victim Lopez, to call the police. As Aguirre returned to his van, he saw the man heading into the gas station. Aguirre drove off and made a U-turn onto the adjacent freeway, and when he looked back, he saw the man and victim Lopez struggling inside the store. Aguirre pulled off the freeway and drove to a nearby bowling alley to ask a security guard to call the police. He then returned to the Shamrock at about the time the police began arriving. Aguirre identified DeLuna that evening as the man he had seen with the knife, except DeLuna no longer had on the white shirt. Aguirre was not asked to identify DeLuna at trial. At around the same time, John and Julie Arsuaga were pulling into a nearby club when they observed a Hispanic man jogging towards the east, away from the Shamrock, in an untucked white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and dark \\"uniform-style\\" pants. Both witnesses identified DeLuna at trial as the man they saw running away from the Shamrock gas station. =Police dispatcher and pursuit of suspects= The Columbia University team documented numerous discrepancies in the various accounts from police radio alerts, police reports, eyewitnesses, and other bystanders: * Baker - who came face-to-face with the attacker after the attack - told police the suspect was \\"wearing a light colored shirt and dark pants,\\" dressed shabbily, wearing a flannel shirt under a gray sweatshirt; the Arsuagas insisted the man they saw jogging near the store wore a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up, untucked and \\"uniform-type\\" pants * Aguirre told police that the man he saw with the knife wore \\"a white shirt (long-sleeve), untucked, and dark pants;\\"Police report at 000005 the Arsuagas told police the subject they saw running was \\"wearing a white long-sleeve shirt untucked and unbuttoned\\"Police Report at 000006 * The first police radio alert advised of a suspect \\"northbound on foot, to the rear\\" of the store; other people in the area reported to police they had seen a man running northbound. The Arsuagas reported the man they saw was jogging eastward, a few hundred yards east of the store. * Baker reported that the suspect had a mustache and approximately 10 days worth of growth in his beard. The Arsuagas reported that the man they saw jogging from the store was \\"clean shaven.\\" * Columbia University researchers showed early 1980s photos of Carlos DeLuna and Carlos Hernandez to numerous family members and acquaintances of the men; many of these people were unable to correctly identify the two men. Police arrived shortly after Lopez's 911 phone call ended and spread out across the area searching for the suspect. The police radio traffic describing the manhunt reveals a chaotic search, with police pursuing several leads towards differing locations with varying suspect descriptions. After first chasing a suspect - repeatedly identified in police radio calls as a male suspect - fleeing on foot several blocks away and further north of the store, police received a 911 call from a neighborhood resident Esther Barrera, who saw someone hiding under a truck in front of her home. Police briefly detained a female several blocks from where they last reported to be chasing the suspect. Police also briefly stopped a car described as \\"a blue Mercury or LTD\\" and occupied by \\"two Hispanic males\\" in the area of the chase for the suspect. =Arrest= Police eventually found DeLuna, 30‚Äì40 minutes after the crime, hiding a few blocks away from the Shamrock gas station underneath a parked truck. Despite it being a cold February night, he had on no shoes or shirt and was lying in a puddle of water. The police pulled him out, and found that he had a black wallet containing 2 one dollar bills in his rear pocket, and a \\"wad\\" or \\"clump\\" of bills totaling $149 in the front pocket of his dark pants. Despite the extremely bloody crime scene, no blood was ever found on Carlos DeLuna. Allan Bayle, a forensic expert assisting the Columbia team, opined that Lopez was behind the counter handing her attacker the money, while the attacker remained in front of the counter. This opinion conflicts with the report of two eyewitnesses to the attack (Baker and Aguirre) who both said they saw the attacker wrestling with Lopez. Baker told police he saw the attacker attempting to drag Lopez by the hair into a room at the back of the store. Pretrial investigations The police put DeLuna in the back seat of a patrol car and brought him to the crime scene for a \\"show-up.\\" After initial hesitation about participating in the \\"show-up\\" due to fear, both Baker and Aguirre looked into the police car and identified DeLuna as the man they'd seen attack Lopez. Interviewed in 2004, Baker told the Columbia team that he was \\"seventy percent\\" sure the man in the police car was the man he had seen fleeing the store. He also said he was trying to be very careful when identifying the man because \\"This is a human being's life‚Äù and \\"it‚Äôs tough you know to identify cross cultures. I didn‚Äôt wanna be, I didn‚Äôt wanna screw anybody.\\" The Arsuagas were too afraid to participate in the \\"show-up\\" at the gas station, but John picked DeLuna out of a photo line-up later that evening, and both positively identified DeLuna at trial. At the time of his arrest, DeLuna had fresh fingernail scratches under his right arm and on his face, and he appeared unshaven. Photos of the scene show an open cash drawer, the bill slots empty, and a $5 bill on the floor.Interior photo Interior photo Shamrock's area manager, Pete Gonzalez, testified that approximately $166 was missing from the inventory since he had personally inventoried it 4 days before the crime, whereas it was typically only off by around $25‚Äì50 over the period of an entire week. Twenty-two years later, the Corpus Christi location's store manager from 1982-1990, Jeff Stange, told investigators that 1) the inventory being $166 short of the last inventory count was not an unusual amount, 2) per store policy, Lopez most likely would have had no more than $75 in cash in the register at the time of the attack, and 3) he recalled that \\"somewhere between 70 and 134 dollars\\" was missing from inventory.Stange interview (24 February 2005) Liebman, James; et al thewrongcarlos.net (Columbia DeLuna Project) p. 49 Two days after the crime, a nearby homeowner was mowing his grass and found white track-type shoes and a white shirt on his property. Forensic tests on the shirt and shoes were negative for blood, and no blood was found on the pants DeLuna was wearing when he was arrested or on the wad of money that was in his pocket. Prior to trial, DeLuna was examined by two psychiatrists to determine whether he might have a mental defense. DeLuna told both of them that he had no recollection of being arrested and that he had total amnesia about the night in question.Psychiatric reports The trial Ellis Unit, where DeLuna was held on death row Huntsville Unit, where DeLuna was executed Two attorneys were appointed to represent DeLuna at trial. The first, Hector De Pena Jr., was the son of a local judge and a former Deputy District Attorney and County prosecutor who had been in practice since 1972. After the trial, De Pena was elected to the bench, where he has remained. Since De Pena had never represented a criminal defendant in front of a jury on any kind of serious criminal charge, the judge also appointed a seasoned criminal defense attorney, Jimmy Lawrence, to serve as the \\"first chair\\" trial attorney. As the more experienced attorney, Lawrence conducted most of the direct and cross-examinations, and gave the closing argument in both the guilt and penalty phases. DeLuna took the stand in his own defense and testified as follows: He spent the early evening with two sisters, Mary Ann Perales and Linda Perales. A man named Carlos Hernandez approached them. Although DeLuna did not originally recognize Hernandez, after talking to him he realized that they had known each other as kids. DeLuna testified that he was wearing a blue shirt, black pants, and black slip-on shoes. Thereafter, DeLuna and Hernandez went to a bar named Wolfy's, located directly across the street from the Shamrock gas station. Hernandez said he was going over to the Shamrock to buy something, so DeLuna ordered a beer at Wolfy's and waited. DeLuna began wondering why Hernandez was taking so long, so he stepped outside Wolfy's to see what was going on. DeLuna could see across the street and into the Shamrock and observed Hernandez attacking Lopez. Worried that people might say he was involved with Hernandez, DeLuna started walking away on Dodd toward Nemec (i.e., not in the direction of the Phase III where the Arsuagas saw a man running). When DeLuna heard sirens, he started running. He testified that his shirt was ripped clean from his body while climbing over a fence. The rolled up bundle of bills in his pocket was from two recent paychecks. On cross-examination, DeLuna was asked about the white shirt and shoes that were found in a nearby yard, and he testified that they were not his. DeLuna admitted that he was a twice convicted felon and that he had lied to the psychiatrists who examined him. DeLuna admitted he was unable to identify Carlos Hernandez from his mugshot. The prosecution offered rebuttal evidence to show that 1) one of the sisters that DeLuna claimed to have been with that evening, Mary Anne Perales, was actually attending her baby shower, 2) DeLuna lied about his whereabouts that afternoon to his parole officer, and 3) DeLuna frequented the Casino Club. Carlos Hernandez was also known to be a regular at the Casino Club. After deliberating for four and a half hours, the jury convicted DeLuna of capital murder. At the penalty phase, the prosecution introduced evidence that DeLuna had committed two attempted rapes. The prosecution called Juanita Garcia, the 54-year-old invalid mother of DeLuna's best friend. DeLuna attempted to rape her just 2 days after his release from prison on an earlier conviction for attempted rape, breaking three of Garcia's ribs. This incident caught DeLuna's lawyers by surprise, since he had only been charged with misdemeanor assault in this incident so they did not thoroughly investigate it. The jury deliberated for six hours before deciding that DeLuna was likely to reoffend, whereupon the judge sentenced him to death. One of DeLuna's lawyers, Hector De Pe√±a, believes that DeLuna and Carlos Hernandez robbed the convenience store together (though he offers no specific arguments for the theory and it seems to be contradicted by eyewitness testimony), but \\"DeLuna was in front of the counter with Hernandez when Hernandez leapt over the counter and stabbed Lopez.\\" De Pe√±a suggests that DeLuna was afraid to identify Hernandez: \\"He didn't want to risk possibly getting hurt in the county jail or even killed on the street.\\" DeLuna's other lawyer, James Lawrence, said \\"If you tell me they killed the wrong guy, I don't know\\", and that \\"it still bothers me to this day\\" that DeLuna refused to identify Hernandez from photos. Lawrence added, \\"Of course he was guilty.\\"Interview with James Lawrence Subsequent investigations In a death row interview, DeLuna told a local news reporter \\"I was standing there when somebody else did what they did, you know. But I don't want to name no names.\\"TV interview at 1:44-55 In June 2006, the Chicago Tribune published a series of investigative news stories that examined evidence that DeLuna may have been convicted in error. Extensive further research on the case was published in May 2012 by the Columbia Human Rights Law Review. Their lengthy report is based on six years of research by law professor and anti-death penalty advocate James Liebman and 12 students from Columbia Law School in New York. Their team went through the case, interviewed more than 100 witnesses, and examined up to 900 source files. Both investigations focused on DeLuna's claim that another man, Carlos Hernandez, had committed the crime. Police had not investigated Hernandez for the murder, and at trial, prosecutor Steve Schwietz referred to Hernandez as a \\"phantom\\" because DeLuna was unable to identify any specific individual as the Carlos Hernandez he was placing the blame on, despite having been shown mug shots of every Carlos Hernandez in the Corpus Christi system (including the Carlos Hernandez that the Columbia team later focused on). According to DeLuna's sister, even his trial lawyers did not believe the \\"Carlos Hernandez\\" story. \\\\- Whilst according to the Chicago Tribune \\"Not only was he [Hernandez] well-known to police in this Gulf Coast city as a violent felon, but the co-prosecutor at De Luna's trial and the lead detective in the case knew Hernandez too. [...] Jurors heard none of that information. The prosecutor sat silently as his colleague branded Hernandez a figment of De Luna's imagination.\\" However, the Chicago Tribune and Columbia University teams rather easily discovered extensive details about and acquaintances of the Carlos Hernandez to whom DeLuna had long referred. Hernandez, who died from cirrhosis in a Texas prison in 1999, was a career criminal living in the same neighborhood and had a history of assaulting women, robbing gas stations, and carrying knives. The Columbia team found people who knew Hernandez and said he bragged to them about murdering Lopez and letting DeLuna take the fall. They also learned Hernandez had been arrested as a suspect ‚Äì before charges were dropped ‚Äì in the death of a woman, Dahlia Sauceda, killed several years earlier in the same area of Corpus Christi. Sauceda's body was found with a large \\"X\\" carved in her back via knife. Hernandez also later served 19 months (of a 10-year sentence) in prison for stabbing another woman, Dina Ybanez, with a lock-blade knife nearly identical to the one used in the Lopez killing. The Columbia report documented numerous cases in which Hernandez was arrested while in possession of lock- blade knives similar to the one used to kill Lopez. Additionally, numerous people interviewed by the Columbia team said they knew Hernandez carried lock- blade knives. (Conversely, Carlos DeLuna was never in possession of a knife at the time of any of his many arrests during his lifetime.) The report also documented problems with the show-up identification of DeLuna by Baker, the preservation of the crime scene, failure by the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence, and DeLuna's representation by overworked and inexperienced defense counsel.Columbia Human Rights Law Review 43.3:711, Chapter IV The passion of Carlos Deluna, Retrieved 19 May 2012Liebman, James S. et al Los Tocayos Carlos Epilogue, Page 6, Retrieved 19 May 2012 The Columbia report has drawn criticism from some officials in Corpus Christi. Nueces County District Attorney Mark Skurka, who was not involved with DeLuna's case and has not read the Columbia report, said that the researchers are arguing the same issues and complained that \\"[those] people have already made up their mind, it doesn't matter what anyone says.\\" Corpus Christi police investigator Paul Rivera says that at the Columbia team's request, he reviewed the police and trial records but continues to believe DeLuna killed Lopez. On the other hand, Wanda Lopez's brother, Richard, issued a statement in June 2006 saying, \\"After carefully reviewing the information recently uncovered and printed by Steve Mills and Maurice Possley in the Chicago Tribune, I am convinced that Carlos DeLuna did not kill my sister and that Carlos Hernandez was the real murderer.\\" See also * At the Death House Door * Cameron Todd Willingham * Capital punishment debate in the United States * Carroll Pickett * List of people executed in Texas, 1982‚Äì89 * List of wrongful convictions in the United States * Reasonable doubt * Texas Moratorium Network * Wrongful executions in the United States References Category:20th-century executions by Texas Category:1989 deaths Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Executed people from Texas Category:People convicted of murder by Texas Category:People executed by Texas by lethal injection Category:People executed for murder Category:1962 births Category:People from Corpus Christi, Texas Category:20th-century executions of American people ","title":"Carlos DeLuna"},{"id":"35829415","text":"Students on Ice (also known as SOI) is a Canadian charitable organisation that leads educational expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic for international high school and university students. Its mandate is to provide youth, educators and scientists from around the world with learning and teaching opportunities in the polar regions, with the goal of fostering new understanding of and respect for the global environment.  History  Students on Ice (SOI) was founded in 2000 by Geoff Green, a Canadian explorer and educator. Before founding the organization, Green had led numerous expeditions to the Arctic, Antarctica, and other destinations around the world. Believing that expeditions to the polar regions had the power to inspire and transform, he decided to create an organization aimed specifically at secondary school students that would provide them with learning opportunities in circumpolar regions. The objective of a Students on Ice expedition is to inspire and challenge youth at a critical time in their lives to think and act positively and proactively as global citizens. SOI creates attachments between the world and the young citizens who inhabit it by putting them physically in contact with issues relating to the planet‚Äôs well-being. This concept is supported by the work of educational researchers such as David Sobel, David A. Gruenewald, and Gregory Smith, who argue that place-based learning or place-conscious learning ::introduces children and youth to the skills and dispositions needed to regenerate and sustain communities. It achieves this end by drawing on local phenomena as the source of at least a share of children‚Äôs learning experiences, helping them to understand the processes that underlie the health of natural and social systems essential to human welfare. The first SOI expeditions were to Antarctica in 2000 and the Arctic in 2001. As of 2012, twenty-five polar expeditions had been completed including two expeditions to Antarctica for university students. More than 2,000 high school and university students, teachers, and experts from fifty- three countries have participated on SOI expeditions. The Students on Ice slogan \\"Protect the poles, protect the planet\\" was adopted in 2008.. In June 2012, a delegation of SOI alumni attended the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio +20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where they addressed world leaders and tabled a recommendation paper emphasizing the need for long-term polar sustainability. The alumni delegation was also represented at the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar.  Operations  Students on Ice is currently based in Gatineau, Quebec. It conducts two ship-based journeys annually: typically one to the Eastern Canadian Arctic and western coast of Greenland (and occasionally Iceland); and the other to southern South America, the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding Southern Ocean. Expeditions typically involve 100 international students, aged 14 and up. The students travel with a team of staff and educators including scientists, historians, artists, elders, explorers, polar experts and others. SOI also offers a biennial expedition offering university-level course credits for undergraduate and graduate students through a program of Zodiac boat excursions and ship-board presentations and research activities in partnership with several international universities and educational institutions. Additionally, SOI has led occasional Arctic floe edge expeditions (to the region where the frozen Arctic Ocean meets the open ocean) during which students travel by snowmobile and qamutiq (komatik) across the sea ice. SOI also organized a Gulf of St. Lawrence research trip with whale expert Richard Sears and Mingan Island Cetacean Study biologists to observe and survey the endangered blue whale.  Founder, Geoff Green  Geoff Green is the founder and executive director of Students on Ice Expeditions, and President of the Students on Ice Foundation and the Polar Education Foundation. He has been leading polar expeditions for more than two decades. In 2012, he was appointed to the Order of Canada in recognition of \\"his contributions as an environmental educator and explorer, notably his commitment to conservation issues in the Arctic and Antarctic.\\" He was recognized as one of 25 Transformational Canadians in 2010 by The Globe and Mail, the CTV Television Network and La Presse; one of Canada‚Äôs ‚ÄòTop 40 under 40‚Äô and as Outpost Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄòTop 5 Canadian Explorers‚Äô to watch. Geoff received a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition by the U.S. Congress in 2005 for his work with youth and the environment and a Citation of Merit for outstanding feats of exploration and service from the Explorers Club, New York City. His Inuktitut name, bestowed upon him by the Commissioner of Nunavut in 2010, is ‚ÄúPitsiulak.‚Äù Green is a veteran expedition leader of over one-hundred Antarctic and Arctic expeditions. He is the first person to have water-skied in both polar regions, has been through the Northwest Passage three times, and has retraced parts of Sir Ernest Shackleton‚Äôs famed Endurance journey six times. This included a 1998 expedition with descendants of Shackleton‚Äôs crew. He is a Fellow of the Explorers Club, a board member for the Ottawa Riverkeeper, the Mingan Island Cetacean Study, the Arctic Circle Club, and the Canadian National Committee for the International Polar Year 2007‚Äì2008. He is also the national ambassador for the Jardin des Glaciers project in Baie Comeau, Quebec, and the national spokesperson for Brita's Filter for Good campaign. Green has addressed schools, conferences, and corporate and special events around the world. He has been a guest speaker at the Royal Geographical Society in London, England, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., and the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. Green and SOI expeditions have been featured in international media, and in numerous documentaries and television programs. Antarctic Youth Expeditions Students on Ice organizes annual ship-based journeys to southern South America, the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding Southern Ocean during the Austral summer when the weather conditions are suitable. It is at this time of year that the surrounding sea ice has melted sufficiently to allow access to Antarctic waters, which are abundant with millions of penguins, seals, seabirds and whales. During this season, Antarctica is home to the greatest concentration of wildlife on Earth. On board activities for students include presentations, seminars and other hands-on activities focused on topics including the history, geography, and the flora and fauna of the Antarctic. Students have the opportunity to assist international scientists who are conducting on-going research projects and fieldwork. During forum sessions, students examine the complex environmental, geopolitical and economical issues facing Antarctica, while simultaneously exploring solutions and policy alternatives to the challenges facing the Antarctic and the planet. Students make shore landings on the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula in Zodiac boats operated by qualified guides. They also visit islands noted for their abundant penguin populations. Students on Ice is a member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), a member organisation founded in 1991 to advocate and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic. All activities adhere strictly to industry-generated Antarctic Visitor and Tour Operator Guidelines. =Route and itinerary= The Antarctic itinerary is always subject to change due to weather and ice conditions. The SOI website states: ‚ÄúWe take advantage of all our opportunities, while at the same time respecting the power of the Antarctic climate.‚Äù Expeditions begin in late December when students travel to gateway cities of Toronto, New York, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, or Santiago, Chile, ultimately to convene as one international group in Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost town in the world. Students typically spend a day in Ushuaia hiking into the Tierra del Fuego backcountry and participating in pre-expedition educational activities. The ship-based expedition begins as the expedition vessel exits the Beagle Channel and heads for the Drake Passage. SOI Antarctic expedition participants have the unique experience of celebrating Christmas or ringing in the New Year as they cross the Antarctic convergence and make their first landing in the South Shetland Islands. Itinerary items in Antarctica include Zodiac boat landings and cruises to Paulet Island and the Argentine Esperanza Base; Deception Island, a dormant volcano inhabited by chinstrap penguins; Koerner Rock, Neko Harbour and Ukraine's Vernadsky Station, a scientific research base in Antarctica; Petermann Island, home of gentoo penguin and Ad√©lie penguin colonies, Pleneau Island, Danco Island, and Goudier Island, and the rocky Wauwermans Islands. On the return trip through the Drake Passage, the lecture series continues and student forum activities commence. The return trip, weather conditions permitting, includes a sail around famous Cape Horn. Students return to Ushuaia to disembark from the expedition vessel and catch return flights home via Buenos Aires, Santiago, New York and Toronto. According to the SOI website, a ‚Äújourney that once took explorers two years to accomplish will now take us just over two weeks!‚Äù =The expedition vessel= In past years, a number of expedition vessels have been engaged for SOI Antarctic expeditions. They include MV Polar Star, which has been converted for expedition cruising, and the MV Akademik Shokalskiy. The SOI‚Äôs southern expeditions have been conducted on the research vessel, the MV Ushuaia, built in 1970 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). She has served for the NOAA under the names Researcher and Malcolm Baldrige. The ship can carry approximately 84 passengers and staff and has more than 40 cabins as well as an open bridge policy, deck space, dedicated research areas and public areas including a dining room, an observation lounge, a conference room with modern multimedia equipment and a well-stocked library. Arctic Youth Expeditions Each Arctic ship-based journey follows a unique itinerary, but past SOI Arctic expeditions have explored Iceland, southern Greenland, in coastal regions of Baffin Island, the north shore of Labrador, coastal regions of Manitoba, and Canada‚Äôs high Arctic. The expedition focus is on making links between local realities and global issues. Students visit Arctic communities and meet with local Inuit to consider how the Arctic shapes northern identity. They learn about the effects of climate change on Arctic ecosystems and explore options toward the advancement of a sustainable Arctic and a sustainable planet. While on the expedition, participants encounter a wide variety of wildlife, including whales, seals, polar bears, and seabirds, and they participate in hands-on educational and research activities. Activities include Zodiac cruises, shore landings, hikes, community visits, and ship- based presentations, workshops, small group discussions and time for personal reflection. =Route and itinerary= On average, the summer expedition is 15 days in length. After participants have assembled in Ottawa, they fly north. The itinerary changes from year to year and expeditions have variously embarked from Iceland, Iqaluit, Nunavut, Kuujjuaq, Nunavik, Churchill, Manitoba, or Pangnirtung and Baffin Island. Once aboard the ship, students have the opportunity to observe humpbacks, minke whales, orcas, narwhals, bowhead whales, belugas, walruses, polar bears and dozens of seabird species, and to explore high Arctic coastal regions via Zodiac boat excursions and landings to see glaciers, icebergs, fjords, and the world‚Äôs northernmost communities and research stations. Expeditions beginning in Iceland have in the past included land-based activities such as a day in Reykjav√≠k; visits to the Blue Lagoon, active geysers, Iceland‚Äôs icecap, ancient fishing villages, the volcanic Vestmannaeyjar, or Westman Islands; a tour of a geothermal power plant; a hike in Thingvellir National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site or along the shores of Skagafj√∂r√∞ur, aka the Skaga Fjord, Saudarkrokur; a trip to Hvammstangi, home of the Icelandic Seal Centre, or the Husavik Whale Museum, located on the eastern shore of the Skjalfandi Bay. Itineraries involving Greenland have featured visits to Herjorlfsnes, the Nordic settlement founded by Erik Thorvaldsson aka Erik the Red c. 985, the ancient hot springs on the island of Uunartoq, Jakobshavn Glacier; and Tasermiut Fjord. Expeditions to Labrador have included trekking in the Torngat Mountains National Park and Zodiac landings at Killiniq Island and Cape Chidley. Past eastern Arctic Archipelago expeditions have focused on Baffin Island with excursions to Pangnirtung Fjord, Sam Ford Fjord, or Sunneshine Fjord, home of a Cold War-era Distant Early Warning Line (or, DEW Line) radar station; Sirmilik National Park and Auyuittuq National Park; the Grinnell Glacier or Cape Dorset; and Butterfly Bay. Arctic expeditions itineraries also routinely venture to the smaller islands in the Davis Strait, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay. Day trip destinations have included Kekerton Historic Park, an abandoned whaling station, Monumental Island, named in honour of early Arctic explorer, Sir John Franklin, the uninhabited Lower Savage Islands, and Akpatok Island, which with International Biological Program status, is a Canadian Important Bird Area (IBA) and a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site. Expeditions typically conclude with a final celebration with students, expedition experts, and local dignitaries and citizens in Resolute Bay, Iqaluit, or Kuujjuaq, Nunavik. From there, participants board a First Air charter flight to return to Ottawa, Ontario. =The expedition vessel= In past years, a number of expedition vessels have been engaged for SOI Arctic expeditions. They include the Akademik Ioffe, the Kapitan Khlebnikov, the MV Explorer, and the Polar Ambassador. Most recently, the SOI‚Äôs expedition vessel of choice has been the MV Clipper Adventurer, an ice-capable charter ship operating in both polar regions. She was built in 1975 in the former Yugoslavia and operated as the Alla Tarasova. In 1998, she underwent a $13 million refit. She has capacity for 122 passengers in 61 cabins, all with exterior views. She also has a window-lined dining room, a library, and two common lounges. Antarctic University Expeditions In February 2009, SOI inaugurated its biennial Antarctic University Expedition in partnership with the University of Alberta, the University of Northern British Columbia, and the University of Ottawa as well as numerous corporate and government agencies. This ship-based expedition was the first of its kind and offered undergraduate and graduate students from any university anywhere in the world an opportunity to take university-level credit courses while on expedition to the Antarctic continent. The 2009 expedition involved 71 international students and 17 university faculty, scientists, policy makers and polar experts. A second university expedition was made in 2011, this time attracting more than 60 students from 23 universities and a team of 30 educators and other staff. The list of supporting universities included Carleton University, Lule√• University of Technology, Sweden, McGill University, the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. The United Nations also became one of the sponsoring agencies for this expedition through the UN Environment Programme, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, and the UN Programme on Youth. The 2009 and 2011 university expeditions included field trips and landings on the Antarctic mainland. These were supplemented by lectures, presentations, seminars and lab exercises in a dedicated space aboard the expedition ship, the MV Ushuaia. Lectures and workshop subjects included geology, geopolitics, social and cultural history, terrestrial ecology, marine biology, glaciology, oceanography and hydrology, atmospheric sciences, ornithology, and environmental studies. Students were also given a chance to work with the education team members on ongoing scientific research (e.g., wildlife surveys, measuring pollution levels in ice core samples, plankton tows focusing on marine diversity, etc.) A third Students on Ice Antarctic University Expedition occurred December 27, 2013 ‚Äì January 10, 2014.

Life Theophilus Jones was the son of Hugh Jones (d. 1799), vicar of Llangammarch and then Llywel, Brecknockshire, and a prebendary of the collegiate church of Brecon; and his wife, Elinor (d. 1786), daughter of the historian Theophilus Evans.Roberts 2004. For many years he practised as a solicitor in Brecon. The death of his father gave him an additional degree of financial security, and following his appointment as deputy-registrar of the archdeaconry of Brecon, he sold his business in 1808 to have time to write. Jones married Mary Price in 1783. He died on 15 January 1812, and was buried in the church of Llangammarch; his widow died on 22 July 1828. Works Jones's History of the County of Brecknock was published in two volumes in Brecon in 1805 and 1809. It was reprinted in one volume in 1898; and in a considerably enlarged form in four volumes, edited by Joseph Russell Bailey, 1st Baron Glanusk, in 1909 to 1930. Jones also published antiquarian communications in magazines, two papers in the Cambrian Register in 1795 and 1796, and another in Archaeologia, journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1814. He planned to write a history of Radnorshire which, however, never materialised; and he began a translation of Ellis Wynne's romance Gweledigaethau y Bardd Cwsg (Visions of the Sleeping Bard).

The album concept, and initial production was initiated by Executive Producer Jason Samel. Jason Samel later recruited Producers Maegan Hayward, Alex Emanuel and Shirley Menard to assist with the project. The set consists of 99 songs inspired by or related to the Occupy movement. Proceeds from the album went \\"directly towards the needs of sustaining this growing movement.\\" Composition Occupy This Album is a four-disc compilation box set containing 76 songs by various artists; the digital version contains 99 tracks. Michael Moore contributed vocals on his cover of Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\", produced by Jason Samel and Eric Weinrib, a song he had previously performed in his 1998 film The Big One. Moore, who had been approached to direct a music video for the compilation, is accompanied by Tom Chapin on guitar and harmonica. Approximately two thirds of the way into the track, Moore leads a human microphone chorus with the chant: \\"We are here to conduct an intervention\\". One of the album's standout tracks \\"We Can't Make It Here\\" was written and performed by James McMurtry and recorded along with Steve Earle and Joan Baez on vocals. Critically acclaimed, it's been cited among The Nation's \\"Best Protest Songs Ever\\"; one of the \\"25 Best Songs of the 2000s\\" in Rolling Stone magazine; and declared \\"a triumph ‚Äî the anthem of the 99%,\\" by Bob Lefsetz. Promotion City Winery in New York City hosted a record release party on May 8, 2012, which included performances by Matt Pless, the initial inspiration for the album. Other performers included Ace Reporter, David Amram, Angels of Vice, Jennie Arnau, Richard Barone, Chroma, Dave Dreiwitz, and Kevin Twigg, the Fear Nuttin Band, Nanci Griffith with Pete and Maura Kennedy, DJ Logic, Jesse Lenat, Los Cintron, George Martinez and The Global Block Collective, Michael Moore with Tom Chapin, Rejectionist Front, Greg Smith and Broken English, and Taj Weekes. Critical reception Critical reception of the album was mixed. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson gave the compilation series a B+ rating and wrote, \\"the spirit of the compilation feels more positive than negative ‚Äî the best that can be asked of any grassroots revolution\\". Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones called the album a \\"mashup of sometimes discordant messages\\" lacking in \\"musical cohesion\\", though he complimented the album's \\"star power\\" and felt the best songs were contributed by rappers. Many reviewers criticized or complimented select tracks. Anderson's favorite songs included Ace Reporter's \\"propulsive\\" rendition of \\"The World Is on Fire\\" and Deborah Harry's \\"glitchy\\" \\"Safety in Numbers\\". Harkinson called Michael Moore's version of the Bob Dylan song \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" \\"rotten\\", but considered Third Eye Blind's \\"If There Ever Was a Time\\" a \\"gem\\".

Based upon parallax measurements obtained during the Hipparcos mission, it is located roughly distant from the Sun. The system consists of a binary star (Zeta Piscium A) and a triple star system (BC), the latter consisting of a spectroscopic binary (B) and a single star (C). A's two components are themselves designated Zeta Piscium Aa (officially named Revati ) and Ab; B's two components as Ba and Bb. As the star system is 0.21¬∞ south of the ecliptic, it can be eclipsed (occulted) by the moon, when close to or at one of its two nodes of its orbit; and is eclipsed by the sun from about 8-10 April.In the Sky Earth astronomy reference utility showing the ecliptic and relevant date as at J2000 - present.  Nomenclature  Œ∂ Piscium (Latinised to Zeta Piscium) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the three constituents as Zeta Piscium A, B and C, and those of A's and B's components - Zeta Piscium Aa, Ab, Ba and Bb - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system is identified with Revati (‡§∞‡•á‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä rƒìvatƒ´, ), one of the Indian nakshatra (lunar mansions). In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Revati for the constituent Zeta Piscium A on 30 June 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. Where a component letter is not explicitly listed, the WGSN says that the name should be understood to be attributed to the brightest component by visual brightness (component Aa in this case).

In 1690, the astronomer Johannes Hevelius in his Firmamentum Sobiescianum regarded the constellation Pisces as being composed of four subdivisions. Xi Piscium was considered to be part of the Linum Austrinum, the South Cord. The star is visible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 4.60. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 11.67 mas as seen from Earth, it is located about 280 light years from the Sun. It is moving away from the Sun, having a radial velocity of +26 km/s. This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 4.6 years and an eccentricity of around 0.18. The spectroscopic binary nature of this star was discovered in 1901 by William Wallace Campbell using the Mills spectrograph at the Lick Observatory. The visible component is an evolved K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It is a red clump star, which indicates it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core.

Over the course of several decades, he has planted and tended trees on a sandbar of the river Brahmaputra turning it into a forest reserve. The forest, called Molai forest after him, is located near Kokilamukh of Jorhat, Assam, India and encompasses an area of about 1,360 acres / 550 hectares. In 2015, he was honoured with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. He was born in the indigenous Mising tribe of Assam. Career In 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to excessive heat after floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the sandbar. He started working on the forest in 1979 when the social forestry division of Golaghat district launched a scheme of tree plantation on 200 hectares at Aruna Chapori situated at a distance of 5 km from Kokilamukh in Jorhat district. Molai was one of the labourers who worked in that project which was completed after five years. He chose to stay back after the completion of the project even after other workers left. He not only looked after the plants, but continued to plant more trees on his own, in an effort to transform the area into a forest. The forest, which came to be known as Molai forest, now houses Bengal tigers, Indian rhinoceros, and over 100 deer and rabbits. Molai forest is also home to monkeys and several varieties of birds, including a large number of vultures. There are several thousand trees, including valcol, arjun (Terminalia arjuna), ejar (Lagerstroemia speciosa), goldmohur (Delonix regia), koroi (Albizia procera), moj (Archidendron bigeminum) and himolu (Bombax ceiba). Bamboo covers an area of over 300 hectares. A herd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year and generally stay for around six months. They have given birth to 10 calves in the forest in recent years. His efforts became known to the authorities in 2008, when forest department officials went to the area in search of a herd of 115 elephants that had retreated into the forest after damaging property in the village of Aruna Chapori, which is about 1.5 km from the forest. The officials were surprised to see such a large and dense forest and since then the department has regularly visited the site. In 2013, poachers tried to kill the rhinos staying in the forest but failed in their attempt due to Molai who alerted department officials. Officials promptly seized various articles used by the poachers to trap the animals. Molai is ready to manage the forest in a better way and to go to other places of the state to start a similar venture. Now his aim is to spread his forest to another sand bar inside of Brahmaputra. Personal life Jadav Payeng belongs to the Mising tribe in Assam, India. He lives in a small hut in the forest. Binita, his wife, and his 3 children (two sons and a daughter) accompany him. He has cattle and buffalo on his farm and sells the milk for his livelihood, which is his only source of income. In an interview from 2012, he revealed that he has lost around 100 of his cows and buffaloes to the tigers in the forest, but blames the people who carry out large scale encroachment and destruction of forests as the root cause of the plight of wild animals. Honours Jadav Payeng receiving Padma Shri award from President Pranab Mukherjee Jadav Payeng was honoured at a public function arranged by the School of Environmental Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University on 22 April 2012 for his achievement. He shared his experience of creating a forest in an interactive session, where Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh and JNU vice- chancellor Sudhir Kumar Sopory were present. Sopory named Jadav Payeng as the \\"Forest Man of India\\". In the month of October 2013, he was honoured at the Indian Institute of Forest Management during their annual event Coalescence. In 2015, he was honoured with Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. He received honorary doctorate degree from Assam Agricultural University and Kaziranga University for his contributions. In popular culture Payeng has been the subject of a number of documentaries in the recent years. A locally made film documentary, produced by Jitu Kalita in 2012, The Molai Forest, was screened at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Jitu Kalita, who lives near Payeng's house, has also been featured and given recognition for good reporting by projecting the life of Payeng through his documentary. The 2013 film documentary Foresting life, directed by the Indian documentary filmmaker Aarti Shrivastava, celebrates the life and work of Jadav Payeng in the Molai forest. These are also the focus of William Douglas McMaster's 2013 film documentary Forest Man. With US$8,327 pledged on its Kickstarter campaign, the film was brought to completion and taken to a number of film festivals. It was awarded the Best Documentary prize at the Emerging Filmmaker Showcase in the American Pavilion at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. An illustration of Jadav Payeng, from the biographical children's book Jadav and the Tree-Place by Vinayak Varma Payeng is also the subject of the children's book Jadav and the Tree-Place, written and illustrated by Vinayak Varma. The book was published by the open-source children's publishing platform StoryWeaver, and its production was funded by a grant from the Oracle Giving Initiative.

Young had attempted and failed to successfully institute the United Order a second time among the members of the church. President Taylor had seen the success of the Cache Valley Board of Trade and saw it as vehicle to prepare the people for voluntary economic unity.  Purposes & Objectives  = General Purposes = The long-run purpose of the association was \\"to prepare the way for a more completely cooperative society\\" among the Mormon settlements. Utah historian, Edward Tullidge, reported that the movement promised to overcome the perennial conflict between Capital and Labor through the creation of industrial cooperatives. This perspective was echoed by the editor of the Deseret News at the time, \\"Here is the grandest opportunity for the building up of a self- sustaining, industrial and powerful system of cooperative effort ever offered in the history of the world.... What is needed? Practical cooperation. Union of capital and labor, mutual interest between consumer and producer.\\" = Specific Objectives = The Preamble of the Articles of Association of Zion's Central Board of Trade offers a long list of specific objectives for the association: * To maintain a commercial exchange; * to promote uniformity in the customs and usages of producers, manufacturers, and merchants; * to inculcate principles of justice and equity in trade; * to facilitate the speedy adjustment of business disputes; * to arrange for transportation; * to seek remunerative markets for home products; to foster capital and protect labor, uniting them as friends rather than dividing them as enemies; * to encourage manufacturing; * to aid in placing imported articles in the hands of consumers as cheaply as possible; * to acquire and to disseminate valuable agricultural, manufacturing, commercial and economic information, * to secure to its members the benefits of co-operation in the furtherance of their legitimate pursuits, * to unite and harmonize the business relations of the Stake Boards of Trade, now and hereafter to be organized throughout the Territory, with those of the Central Association.  Activities  = Central Board of Trade = * On May 17, 1881, the Zion's Central Board of Trade held a convention in Salt Lake City, inviting representatives of the various Stake boards of trade, \\"for the purpose of arriving at a better understanding of what is needed to more thoroughly develop and assist our home industries; to establish them on a better and firmer footing, and to utilize the natural resources of the Territory.\\" Nineteen industries were on the agenda led by the manufacture of iron and coke. * Iron and Coke - As a direct result of the Board of Trade convention, a committee organized a company in 1881 for the manufacture of iron and coke. They raised 1 million dollars in capital for the Utah Iron Manufacturing Company. Their energies were dissipated for three years during a court battle over alleged claim-jumping by a wealthy non- Mormon. Afterwards, they reorganized the company with a new influx of capital from the LDS Church and were able to hire 20 men to move needed railway equipment from Nevada to southern Utah. * Sugar - The Central Board put a great deal of energy in studying and experimenting with various sources of sugar. In the years following the anti-polygamy raids, the Utah Sugar Company was organized by several prominent leaders of the LDS Church and was the beneficiary of that preliminary work. * Wagons & Agricultural Implements - Here the Board of Trade had its first long-term success. After noting various failed attempts to manufacture these items, the board committee opted to create a buyer's cooperative (similar to the modern consumer cooperative) for importing wagons and farm tools. They launched the Cooperative Wagon and Machine Company with $100,000 of capital in 1883. It later merged with another company and lasted 4 decades. = Stake Boards of Trade = LDS historian, Leonard Arrington, reported the following activities of the local boards of trade: * Contract negotiations in behalf of local Mormon railroad workers. * Established a centralized marketing agency for farm produce. * Creating cooperatives for importing agricultural implements, wagons, buggies, etc. * Setting of agencies to regulate hay and grain prices. * Regulation of specific industries to prevent excessive price and product competition. * Countering the \\"monopoly\\" and \\"discriminatory tactics\\" of the Union Pacific Railroad.  Demise  \\"[T]he enforcement of the Edmunds Anti-polygamy Act in 1884 and thereafter destroyed Zion's Board of Trade. There is no alternative explanation. Board of Trade activities were not declining, but gaining momentum when 'the raid' started.\\" References Category:Defunct organizational subdivisions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:Economic history of Utah ","title":"Zion's Central Board of Trade"},{"id":"35829948","title":"Bluebell Hill transmitting station"},{"id":"35829961","text":"Mali Hebaj is a settlement in the former B√´rdic√´ municipality, Shkod√´r County, northern Albania.

Mordovian Erzia Museum of Visual Arts holds the world's largest collection of more than 200 works done by the famous sculptor of the 20th century Stepan Dmitrievich Erzia. The museum also contains collection of works of Mordovian folk artists, such as F. Sychkov, and I. Makarov. Both of them, as well as Erzia were born in Mordovia. The museum exhibits collections of all the major art forms: painting, drawing, sculpture. There are also expositions and collections of Russian art of the 18th and 19th centuries and of the modern Russian and Mordovian art as well. In 2002, the museum was classified by the Government of Mordovia as one of the most valuable objects of cultural heritage of Mordovian people. History of the museum In 1941, soon after establishing of the Union of Mordovian artists it was decided to found a gallery in order to stimulate young artists and to promote art among working class. On March 14, 1941, in accordance with the resolution of the Counscil of National Mordovian Comissars, the gallery of arts was opened in Saransk. The World War II prevented the establishment of the museum in Saransk. The issue was raised again in 1950's. There were many new artists, some of them were the soldiers who had come back from the war, joined the Union. On January 10, 1960 they established the Mordovian Republican gallery named after a famous Mordovian artist Fedor Sychkov. Also, the museum received a big collection of works of Mordovian famous sculptor Stepan Erzia. At first the museum was in a single-storey building on Sovetskaya Street, but when the permanent exhibition of Erzia sculptures was moved in, the museum was given with another building. The modern building of the museum was given after Erzia‚Äôs 100‚Äôs anniversary. In 1978 the Gallery was reorganised into Mordovian Erzia Museum of Visual Arts. Buildings =The main museum building= The main museum infrastructure consists of two buildings standing side by side. The west wing was built in 1976 (architect V. Sologub), by the 100th anniversary of Erzia. In 1985 the second building was constructed next to the first one. They are connected by the gallery on the 2nd floor. In 2001, on the 125th anniversary of Erzia, the museum was reconstructed and its appearance was greatly improved. =The exhibition hall= The exhibition hall of the museum (Sovetskaya street, 29, Saransk, Russia), was built in the mid 1950s by the architect S.

The instruments shown here include a condensation particle counter, aerosol photometer, and two air sampling pumps for filter-based analysis. A condensation particle counter or CPC is a particle counter that detects and counts aerosol particles by first enlarging them by using the particles as nucleation centers to create droplets in a supersaturated gas. Aerosol Measurement: Principles, Techniques, and Applications, edited by Pramod Kulkarni, Paul A. Baron, Klaus Willeke, p384, retrieved 15 May 2012 Three techniques have been used to produce nucleation: * Adiabatic expansion using an expansion chamber. This was the original technique used by John Aitken in 1888. Kulkarni, Baronand and Willeke, p381 * Thermal diffusion. * Mixing of hot and cold gases. The most usually used (also the most efficient) method is cooling by thermal diffusion. Most abundantly used working fluid is n-butanol; during last years water is also encountered in this use.Condensation Particle Counters (CPC) Condensation particle counters are able to detect particles with dimensions from 2 nm and larger. This is of special importance because particles sized down from 50 nm are generally undetectable with conventional optical techniques. Usually the supersaturation is ca. 100‚Ä¶200 % in condensation chamber, despite the fact that heterogeneous nucleation (droplet growth on surface of a suspended solid particle) can occur at supersaturation as small as 1 %. The greater vapour content is needed because, according to surface science laws, the vapour pressure over a convex surface is less than over a plane, thus greater content of vapor in air is required to meet actual supersaturation criteria. This amount grows (vapor pressure decreases) along with decrease in particle size, the critical diameter for which condensation can occur at the present saturation level is called Kelvin diameter. The supersaturation level must, however, be small enough to prevent homogeneous nucleation (when liquid molecules collide so often that they form clusters ‚Äì stable enough to ensure further growth is possible), which will produce false counts. This usually starts at ca. 300 % supersaturation. Operation of a diffusional thermal cooling CPC is depicted on the right. Air passes through a hollow block of porous material in contact with the working liquid, the block being heated to ensure high vapour content. Then the humified air enters the cooler where nucleation occur. Temperature difference between the heater and the cooler determines the supersaturation, which in its turn determines the minimal size of particles that will be detected (the greater the difference, the smaller particles get counted). As proper nucleation conditions occur in the center of the flow, sometimes incoming flow is divided: most of it undergoes filtering and forms the sheath flow, which the rest of flow, still containing particles, is inserted into via a capillary. The more uniform is obtained supersaturation, the sharper is particle minimal size cutoff. During the heterogeneous nucleation process in the nucleation chamber, particles grow up to 10‚Ä¶12 Œºm large and so are conveniently detected by usual techniques, such as laser nefelometry (measurement of light pulses scattered by the grown-up particles).

Life He was the son of George Probert, who married Magdalen, daughter of Charles Williams (of Llangibby). He was therefore nephew of Sir Trevor Williams; and shared his extreme Protestant views. Probert matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford in 1663, and entered the Inner Temple in 1664. He lived at The Argoed, Penalt. Probert was an associate of John Arnold of Monmouthshire in his campaign against local Catholics and the Jesuits. The two were twice removed as Justice of the Peace by the Marquess of Worcester, in 1677 and 1680, the second time being part of a larger purge of local magistrates by the Tory Worcester. At the beginning of this period Probert and Arnold were pressing the local justices to take action against practising Catholics.Nathan Rogers and the Wentwood Case: a continuing issue in Monmouthshire politics from Charles I to the Chartists, p. 36, Welsh History Review - Vol. 14, nos. 1-4 1988-89.

The population was 16,381 at the 2010 census. The 2012 estimate of Gorham's population was 16,667. In addition to its urban village center known as Gorham Village or simply \\"the Village,\\" the town encompasses a number of smaller, unincorporated villages and hamlets with distinct historical identities, including South Gorham, West Gorham, Little Falls, White Rock, and North Gorham. Gorham is home to one of the three campuses of the University of Southern Maine. In 2013, Gorham was voted second best town in Maine after Hampden by a financial website. Gorham is part of the Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland‚ÄìBiddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Initially named Narragansett Number 7, the village was renamed Gorhamtown Plantation in honor of the famous New England Ranger John Gorham I,Josiah Pierce. A History of the town of Gorham, Maine. p. 169 the great grandfather of John Gorham 4th. Hugh Davis McLellan, History of Gorham, Maine; Smith & Sale, printers; Portland, Maine 1903 History First called Narragansett Number 7 was one of seven townships granted by the Massachusetts General Court to soldiers (or their heirs) who had fought in the Narragansett War of 1675, also called King Philip's War. The land was first settled in 1736 by Captain John Phinney and his family, followed in 1738 by Hugh McLellan and Daniel Mosher. By 1743, the first sawmill was established by John Gorham at Little River. Without window-glass, the first dwellings were constructed of logs chinked with moss and clay. Narragansett Number 7 suffered its first Indian raid in 1745 during King George's War, when the meeting house and Gorham's sawmill were burned. It was attacked again in 1746, when five colonists were killed and three abducted. Incursions during the French and Indian Wars would finally end, however, with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The town was incorporated as Gorham in 1764. It would annex land from Standish in 1831 and 1839, and from Scarborough in 1864. Good soil benefited agriculture, and numerous falls provided water power for industry. The town developed into a manufacturing center, with Portland a nearby market. Products included textiles, clothing, carpet, lumber, barrels, chairmans, carriages, wagons and sleighs. There was also a box factory, corn-canning factory, paper pulp mill, brickyard, tannery, and granite and marble works. The Cumberland and Oxford Canal opened in 1829 connecting Casco Bay with Sebago Lake, although it would be discontinued in 1871, having been rendered obsolete by John A. Poor's York and Cumberland Railroad (later the Boston and Maine Railroad), which entered Gorham in 1851. The railroad was dismantled in 1961, but the former grade serves as a multi-use recreational trail. On September 12, 1870, the first train of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad (later part of the Maine Central Railroad Mountain Division) traveled from Portland to Sebago Lake through White Rock. White Rock station closed in 1921. In 1803, Gorham Academy was founded. Designed by Samuel Elder, the Federal style Gorham Academy Building was erected in 1806. The institution would evolve into Western Maine Normal School, and later Gorham State Teachers College. Today, it is the University of Southern Maine at Gorham. Gorham currently has a much smaller industrial infrastructure than it did in the earlier years. The majority of Gorham's industry is based along the border with Westbrook, and many of the mills that formerly existed along the Presumpscot River are now under water, flooded with the construction of the Dundee Dam. In recent decades Gorham has increased in popularity as a bedroom community of Portland. Its residents and town officials have been confronted with various issues related to managing suburban growth in a historically rural town. Today, Gorham has grown from a small village to a flourishing town. Its popularity has attracted many new housing developments and businesses. Positioned near Sebago Lake, Gorham also offers a plethora of recreational activities such as trails for hiking and the river for kayaking, canoeing and swimming.
