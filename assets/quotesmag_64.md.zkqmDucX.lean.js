The White Carnation is a 1953 play by English playwright R. C. Sherriff. Its premiere production had a cast led by Ralph Richardson, but it was not revived until a 2013 Finborough Theatre production featuring Aden Gillett and Benjamin Whitrow. In 2014, the play was performed at the Jermyn Street Theatre Plot John Greenwood says goodbye to the guests from he and his wife's Christmas Eve, but a gust of wind shuts the front door and leaves him locked out of his own house. He breaks a window to gain entry and finds the house ruined and deserted. A policeman questions him what he is doing in the house, all of whose inhabitants were killed by a V-1 flying bomb during a Christmas Eve party in 1944, but Greenwood indignantly insists that he is in his own house. A coroner and doctor are summoned and inform Greenwood that he was one of the inhabitants killed and that he has returned to the house as a ghost - and that is now 1951. Greenwood is visited by Lydia Truscott, niece of the town clerk, who agrees to help him in his attempts at self-education and returning to the spirit-world. He also meets with a welcome from the local vicar Mr Pendlebury and his next door neighbour Mrs Carter, but also has to deal with the coroner and the Home Office, who are determined to move Greenwood out, knock the house down and build new flats on the site. As the house's demolition begins, Greenwood finally vanishes and in a final scene re-runs his last Christmas Eve party, reconciling with his wife, whom during his haunting he had realised that he had emotionally ill-treated during his lifetime. Critical reaction  Writing in The Sunday Times, the critic Harold Hobson called the original production of the play \\"extremely and touchingly human\\". Of the revival Dominic Cavendish writing in the Telegraph observed, \\"what a neglected little treasure it proves: not life-changing, maybe, but life-affirming\\". However, writing in The Guardian, Michael Billington called the play \\"passably entertaining, but much of its feels like quilted padding.\\" 1963 Australian TV Version The play was adapted for Australian TV in 1963 directed by Christopher Muir.The White Carnation at IMDb Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time.

Scott Rodarte, (member of another L.A. local band, Ollin) who was their instructor, called up bassist Damiano Gatto (another of his students) and asked If he would play in a band. Damian said yes and he started to play with Silva and Samora. When no one was always able to sing the vocals to songs, he asked Kai Knight, and Lani DeSoto to join. Kai Knight and Lani DeSoto were vocal students of Scott's. Soon, the three boys and two singers were performing together, collectively known as the Old Souls. Shortly after forming and practicing for a month or so, they gave their first public performance at the Yosemite Recreation Center in Eagle Rock. Career The band played shows all throughout Los Angeles County. One of their biggest was at the BB King Blues Club in Universal City. The band never did release an album. The closest thing to albums were demos of the band, sometimes given out at concerts. The demos were recorded by Manager Scott Rodarte through Ollin Records.

The original magazine stories have since been adapted into books, comics, television, and film. Liwayway In 1925, Reyes wrote a series of short stories under the series title Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang for Liwayway, the Tagalog-language magazine. Reyes, also known as \\"Don Binoy\\", adopted the persona of Lola Basyang, an elderly woman fond of telling stories to her grandchildren, a character similar in form and function to Mother Goose. The name Basyang is a localized provincial name for the Spanish name Basilia. Tagalog Klasiks In 1949, Reyes' son Pedrito Reyes, decided to revive the Lola Basyang stories in comic book form, locally known as komiks. It was a golden age for Philippine komiks and Pedrito used his father's original scripts to produce the comics that appeared in the earliest issues of Tagalog Klasiks. The illustrations were done by Maning De Leon, Jesus Ramos, and later on Ruben Yandoc. Movie adaptations=Sampaguita Pictures From 1946 to 1972, the golden ages of komiks and movies in the Philippines coincided. Since komiks were a popular form of entertainment in the Philippines, movie producers created some of the greatest box-office blockbusters from them. Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang was produced by Sampaguita Pictures in 1958 as a quartet feature of two Lola Basyang stories: Dolphy starred in Si Pedrong Walang Takot (\\"Fearless Peter\\"). The cowardly Pedro gains courage by means of an enchanted bell that he used to scare away a kapre (a hairy giant from Philippine mythology). The second story is Ang Mahiwagang Kuba (\\"The Enchanted Hunchback\\"). Prince Jorge (Carlos Salazar) is an enchanted prince, who was cursed to become a hideous hunchback until a beautiful lady with a golden heart gives her love to him. In his quest for this beautiful lady, he meets Princess Lucinda, who promises to marry anyone who can heal the ailing king. He also meets a kind-hearted beggar named Feli (Marlene Dauden), who helps him without expecting anything in return. Can the prince heal the ailing king? Is Princess Lucinda the answer to the prince's prayer? Who will truly break the curse? The third story is Ang Dakilang Puso ng Isang Ina (\\"A Mother's Great Heart\\") is a family drama which starred Rosa Mia, Tony Marzan and Priscilla Valdez. The fourth story was Ang Prinsesang Naging Pulubi (\\"The Princess Who Became a Pauper\\"). A Princess from a faraway land (portrayed by Gloria Romero) rejected all of her high-profile suitors, believing that material riches cannot provide genuine happiness. Her constantly spurning her suitors provoked the ire of her father, the King, who decreed that she be given in marriage to the first beggar who enters the royal garden. In that fortunate Beggar (played by Juancho Gutierrez), the Princess found true love. Regal Films In 1985, Regal Films produced Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang. The trilogy's lovable Lola Basyang was portrayed by Chichay, with whom the role is still associated. Directed by Maryo J. de los Reyes, the three stories featured the most popular love teams of the era: Gabby Concepcion and Snooky Serna; William Martinez and Maricel Soriano; and Nora Aunor and Tirso Cruz III. The first story is Nah√≠himbing na Kagandahan (\\"Sleeping Beauty\\"), starring Gabby Concepci√≥n and Snooky Serna, with appearances by Lani Mercado, Nova Villa and Gretchen Barretto. The second story, Zombie, had a horror-comedy slant, and starred Maricel Soriano and William Martinez, along with Manilyn Reynes. The three get lost while on a camping trip, and enter an eerie house manned by the creepy and funny Palito. While eating a stew filled with human entrails, they accept his offer to sleep at the decrepit house, and manage to stay alive. The third episode is a semi-musical titled Kerub√≠n (\\"Cherubim\\"). A group of child labourers work for three, mean old ladies led by Bella Flores. Kerub√≠n (played by Chuckie Dreyfus), an angel sent from heaven, frees the children from the clutches of the evil crones. Nora Aunor stars as the virtuous niece of the mean old hags, while Tirso Cruz III, Lou Veloso, Sheryl Cruz and Tina Paner also appear. The stories in this production did not use original Mga Kwento ni Lola Basyang stories. Unitel Pictures In 2012, Unitel Pictures announced its remake movie which was supposed to be a part of MMFF 2012, but the firm postponed it. As of today, the movie's fate is uncertain. Books=Tahanan Books In 1997, Tahanan Books published a collection of twelve Lola Basyang tales. Poet and literary critic Bienvenido Lumbera sifted through hundreds of manuscripts to select the best of Reyes' tales, while author and publisher Gilda Cordero-Fernando gave an original English translation. The series was illustrated by renowned children's book illustrator Albert Gamos, who produced over 30 drawings. The books won the Gintong Aklat (\\"Golden Book\\") for Children's Literature and the National Book Award for Best Anthology. Anvil Publishing picture books In 2006, Anvil Publishing, Inc. relaunched Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang as a series of picture books based on Reyes' material, retold by Christine Bellen. All books were illustrated by Frances C. Alcar√°z, Albert Gamos, Elbert Or, Liza A. Flores and Ruben de Jes√∫s. The eleven picture books are: *Ang Alamat ng Lamok (The Legend of the Mosquito; originally titled Ang Parusa ng Higante, The Giant's Curse) *Ang Mahiwagang Biyulin (The Magical Violin) *Ang Sultan Saif (Saif the Sultan) *Parusa ng Duwende (The Dwarf's Curse) *Plautin ni Periking (Periking's Flute) *Rosa Mistica (Mystical Rose) *Ang Binibining Tumalo sa Hari (The Maiden Who Defeated a King) *Ang Prinsipe ng mga Ibon (The Prince of the Birds) *Ang Prinsipeng Duwag (The Cowardly Prince) *Si Pandakotyong (Pandakotyong) *Ang Prinsipeng Mahaba ang Ilong (The Prince with the Long Nose) GMA Network In 2007, GMA Network bought the rights for a TV serialization of Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang.

The owner's business connection in lumber and construction presumably helped control building costs, which are nevertheless reported to have been $125,000. A St. Louis newspaper cited it as the finest residence in the state soon after [he, his wife and four daughters] moved into the house in 1900. When the family moved out in 1924 after Cruikshank's death, no one else ever moved in; the house sat empty for 43 years, except for a caretaker family who lived there for a number of years.Oral history from caretakers' granddaughter, Charlotte Yount Cordry, who lived in the house from 1939 to 1943. Arranged around the central hall are grand public rooms meant for entertaining. To one side is the Reception Room, with gilded wallpaper, quarter-sawn oak paneling, and Tiffany fixtures, furnished with a lemonwood sideboard and olivewood reception table commissioned in Florence. The pink and green Music Room is anchored at each end by a grand piano; the Green Room reflects the sensibilities of Mrs. Cruikshank in its gold leaf and garlands, lace and velvet drapes, and white onyx fireplace. Friend and writer Mark Twain [the guest of honor on his last visit to Hannibal] addressed 300 guests and Hannibal citizens from the double staircase [leading to] the second floor during his visit in 1902. The Moorish Room provides the de rigueur eclecticism embraced by the period [including L.C. Tiffany lighting fixtures and stained glass windows].\\" The house has 125 windows [including several large Palladian windows] and 10 fireplaces [of marble and tile]. Cruikshank prided himself on the structural and decorative use of wood on the property, and employed mahogany, oak, and walnut throughout the house. Greek Revival and Art Nouveau decorative motifs recur in various rooms. \\"Most of the rooms had individual thermostatic heat control from a central coal burning steam heating plant. The building originally had electric lighting, but auxiliary gas lights were installed. Rock walls were constructed as part of the landscaping of the property.\\"C. Millstein & C. Grove.

Rockcliffe is in the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public for tours and special events.\\" Rockcliffe still boasts its original furniture, wall coverings, lighting fixtures, bathroom fixtures, books, clothing and personal artifacts of the Cruikshank family.

In 1846, he was appointed Professor (ordentlicher Professor) and head of the general hospital at T√ºbingen. He moved to Leipzig University as Professor and Medical Director of the university hospital four years later. There he introduced clinical pedagogy, combined with a rigorous methodology of diagnosis, and empirical observation of patients. He introduced temperature charts into hospitals, holding that fever is not a disease, but a symptom.

He was known for his lectures on psychiatry and on the \\"pathology and therapy of illnesses of the nervous system.\\" He described an extremely rare eponymous syndrome that consists of retroperitoneal bleeding from the kidney, which tracks into the surrounding tissues.

Lead vocal duties in the original incarnation of the band were shared between Dallaway and The Shend. Current members are The Shend (vocals), Svor Naan (sax), Viscount Biscuits (guitar), Joe 91 (bass) and Rampton Garstang (drums). History The first single from the Cravats was the self-financed \\"Gordon\\", released in 1978. On 31 July 1979 they recorded their first session for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1. Soon after they received a recording contract with Small Wonder Records. Three further Peel Sessions followed on 6 October 1980, 18 August 1981 and 15 November 1982. Debut album In Toytown was released in 1980. The band had a rest at the close of 1982 although a second Cravats LP The Colossal Tunes Out was released in 1983 on the Corpus Christi label. Dallaway and The Shend formed The Very Things, as well as DCL Locomotive and The Babymen \\\\- the latter two had originally featured Svor Naan on guitar. A final release by Dallaway and The Shend as 'The Cravats DCL' was The Land of the Giants EP (1985) however, this incarnation did not include either Svor Naan (saxophone) who had joined Pigbros or, Dave Bennett (on drums) who had joined The Poison Girls. Reformation In 2006, a double CD compilation of Cravats singles and other material was released as The Land Of The Giants - The Best Of The Jazz-Punk Colossals on Overground Records, including new track \\"Seance\\" mixed by Paul Hartnoll of Orbital, and also released as a single. Seance was the last Cravats release to feature Dallaway as lead vocalist. The Cravats original members The Shend and Svor Naan put together a 'live ensemble' for the Rebellion Festival in August 2009. The band continued to play live with gigs in Dublin, London, and further appearances at Rebellion in August 2010, 2011/ and 2012, at the Incubate Festival in Tilburg, and as special guests of Steve Ignorant (Crass) at his final 'Last Supper' show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. A CD reissue of their first LP, The Cravats In Toytown was released in 2012. It includes all five singles (A & B sides) originally released by Small Wonder including the band's 1st single Gordon / Situations Vacant.

The chemical is released from onions, Allium cepa, as they are sliced. The release is due to the breaking open of the onion cells and their releasing enzymes called alliinases, which then break down amino acid sulfoxides, generating sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, formed when onions are cut, is rapidly rearranged by a second enzyme, called the lachrymatory factor synthase or LFS, giving syn- propanethial S-oxide. The gas diffuses through the air and, on contact with the eye, it stimulates sensory neurons creating a stinging, painful sensation. Tears are released from the tear glands to dilute and flush out the irritant. A structurally related lachrymatory compound, syn-butanethial S-oxide, C4H8OS, has been found in another genus Allium plant, Allium siculum.

Background Peter Westerstr√∏m was born in Ljungby in Sweden around 1779. His father Jonas was the local sexton, but died when Peter was 8 years old. His mother died in 1804 and Peter was raised by his brother. He started his professional career as a man-servant; later on he started training as a tailor, but never became more than an apprentice. He later claimed to have tried to have started an enterprise refining cotton, but he had to borrow money and the enterprise failed. This story was never corroborated as there was a state of war between Norway and Sweden at the time and serious doubt was cast on his curriculum. By 1806, he had moved to Norway. By his own confession, the move was in order to avoid being thrown into the debtors' prison after his bankruptcy. An unconfirmed rumour stated that he had fled Sweden after having murdered and robbed his late employer, Lieutenant General Liljehorn. In Norway, he established himself as a tailor in the city of Moss, traveling around the local countryside to obtain work from the surrounding peasantry. The crime During the night of 31 December 1808-1 January 1809, he killed the four inhabitants at the station Sakseb√∏l in Hob√∏l. The victims were the station manager Johannes Jensen and his three servants Lars Arvesen, Jens Svensen and Karen Olsdatter. The murder weapon was an axe he had brought with him for the explicit purpose of murder. The motive was greed; the station manager's strongbox was forced and the house robbed of valuables. Westerstr√∏m fled with 20 daler in cash, some clothes, some silver spoons, a pair of boots and a pipe. After the crime, he tried to reach Sweden but was hindered by foul weather. The investigation The autopsy was undertaken by Dr Hans Munk. An investigative commission was established consisting of Christian Magnus Falsen (judge in Follo), sheriff Jacob Wulfsberg in Christiania (now Oslo), Lieutenant Colonel Hans Jacob von Scheel and the judge in Moss, Ove Hiorth. A reward of 1,000 daler was offered for information that would lead to arrest of the guilty. This reward led to Westerstr√∏m being turned in by friends. On 6 February 1809, Peter Westerstr√∏m was arrested at Moss and brought before the commission. He confessed to the murders after some attempts at denial. The case was open and shut: He was found in possession of much of the stolen goods and could lead the authorities to where he had hidden the rest. As for the motive, Westerstr√∏m first claimed mental depression, stating that he wanted to commit suicide and this way he could get the state executioner to do the job. His second explanation stated that, as he was an unreformable criminal, he wanted to be remembered as the greatest crook in Norwegian history. His third confession stated that the murder was done out of revenge, as he believed the station manager had been instrumental in breaking up his engagement to a rich heiress. Trial and execution On 24 July 1809, he was sentenced by the commission to be pinched five times with red-hot pincers by the executioner; after this his hand would be lopped off with an axe and finally he would be beheaded. The head, the hand and the body would then be publicly displayed on poles until they rotted. This was the punishment recommended for murders within the family (patricides, matricides, but also murders of employers). On 16 August 1809, this sentence was moderated in the Supreme Court. He was sentenced for premeditated homicide only, and the punishment was reduced to simple beheading with axe; the torture was dropped. Only his head would go on the pole. On 23 September 1809, King Frederik VI approved of the sentence of the Supreme Court. On 27 October 1809, Westerstr√∏m was executed in front of the prison in Moss. With him at the scaffold was his parson Niels Wulfsberg. The executioner was Anton L√¶del, this being his fifth execution. After 24 hours, the head was taken down again and buried next to the corpse.

He had surgery on his knee, and then returned on July 31, 2008, much earlier than expected. Dukes landed on the disabled list yet again with a calf strain shortly thereafter, on August 7, 2008. Dukes returned to the Nationals on August 26, 2008 and hit .267 with 7 home runs and 26 RBI over his last 29 games. Overall, Dukes hit for a .264 batting average, with a .386 on-base percentage, .478 slugging percentage, 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in with a total of 276 at bats in 81 games during the 2008 season. Dukes was released by the Nationals on March 17, 2010. =Newark Bears (2010)= Following his release from the Nationals, Dukes reportedly agreed to a deal with the Tabasco Olmecas of the Mexican League in early April, but backed out after not showing up for a reporting date. Dukes signed with the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball on July 2, 2010. Off-the-field problems In 1996, Dukes' father was convicted of second-degree murder. One year later, Dukes was arrested for the first time. Dukes has been arrested at least three times for battery, and once for assault.WFAN radio broadcast, New York Mets v Washington Nationals, September 10, 2008. According to court records, he fathered at least five children with four women between 2003 and 2006. On May 23, 2007, Dukes's wife NiShea Gilbert sought a restraining order against him after he threatened her life and the lives of their children.Encina, Eduardo, and Abbie Vansickle. \\"Ballplayer's wife: He threatened me, kids\\", The St. Petersburg Times, May 23, 2007. On May 2, Dukes had sent a photo of a gun to her cell phone and left her the following voicemail: \\"Hey, dawg. It's on, dawg. You dead, dawg. I ain't even bulls--. Your kids too, dawg. It don't even matter to me who is in the car with you. Ni----, all I know is, ni----, when I see your motherf- a-- riding, dawg, it's on.

When the girl confronted Dukes to inform him about the pregnancy, he allegedly got angry and threw a bottle of Gatorade at her. Dukes has received anger-management training. When Dukes was traded to the Nationals, the team also hired an ex- police officer in the role of \\"Special Assistant: Player Concerns\\". This person accompanied Dukes everywhere to ensure that he kept himself free of trouble. Dukes was arrested in November 2010 for contempt due to failure to pay child support, on March 2, 2011 for assaulting a pregnant ex-girlfriend. and on January 22, 2013 for driving with a suspended license.Elijah Dukes. florida.arrests.org See also * Home run in first Major League at-bat ReferencesExternal links * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:George D.

Details After leaving a fashion sales position to take care of his daughter in 2005, Scott Schuman began carrying a digital camera around on the streets of New York City, taking pictures of people who had dressed in a way that caught his eye, and then posting them to his blog, sometimes with comments about what he'd found. He pioneered fashion photography in blog form. Scott Schuman Schuman began The Sartorialist with the idea of creating a two- way dialogue about the world of fashion and its relationship to daily life. He describes his philosophy as trying to echo how fashion designers looked at what they saw on the street: Schuman collaborated with numerous advertising campaigns: for The Gap and Verizon, with Kiehl's on an exclusively commissioned product and campaign surrounding Father's Day, Nespresso, DKNY Jeans, Gant, OVS, Crate & Barrel. Burberry, meanwhile, tapped Schuman to shoot the groundbreaking social media-cum-advertising ‚ÄúArt of the Trench‚Äù project. Schuman began getting other work from serious fashion publications. Cond√© Nast tapped him to do something similar during Paris Fashion Week for its style.com website. He also regularly works events for Saks Fifth Avenue, and says French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld has also talked to him about doing something for her magazine.

Like many of her class, she was not originally named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. Later she was named for Addison County, Vermont. She was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction LST-31 was laid down on 2 February 1943 at Pittsburgh by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 5 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Maurice Endres; accepted by the Navy and placed in reduced commission on 10 July 1943; and sailed to New Orleans, where she was placed in full commission on 21 July 1943, with Lieutenant John D. Schneidau Jr., USNR, in command. Service history The new tank landing ship got underway on 29 July, for Panama City, Florida, where she conducted a series of beaching exercises. LST-31 returned to New Orleans, on 7 August, to take on cargo for transportation to the Pacific. After a brief port call at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, she transited the Panama Canal, on 24 August, and joined the US Pacific Fleet. She then continued on to San Diego, where she arrived on 13 September. After participating in beaching exercises in the San Diego area, the ship stopped at Port Hueneme, and at San Francisco, to take on cargo. She left the west coast on 15 October, bound for Hawaii, reached Pearl Harbor on 25 October, and began unloading. When this task was completed, LST-31 again weighed anchor on 5 November, and shaped a course for the Gilbert Islands. As a member of 5th Amphibious Force, the ship was slated to take part in the assault on Makin Island. LST-31 arrived off Makin, on 20 November, and began discharging troops and cargo ashore. She remained off that atoll until 3 December, when she got underway to return to Pearl Harbor. Shortly after her arrival, the vessel entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for repairs and alterations. While her engines were being overhauled, additional Bofors guns and Oerlikon cannons were installed. The yard period ended in early January 1944, and the refurbished vessel then took part in training exercises off Maui, in preparation for the forthcoming invasion of the Marshall Islands. The tank landing ship left Pearl Harbor on 19 January and set a course for Kwajalein. She anchored off that atoll on 1 February, and began discharging her cargo in support of operations in the Marshalls. On 12 February, the ship began embarking troops for the invasion of Eniwetok and, five days later, sortied with LST Group 8. She beached at Eniwetok, on 20 February, and began landing her soldiers and discharging cargo ashore. LST-31 remained there until 20 March, when she got underway for Hawaii. She stopped en route at Kwajalein and Tarawa, to take on cargo and passengers and finally reached Pearl Harbor on 15 April. Following repairs in dry dock there, she resumed operations on 10 May, with a series of training exercises in Hapuna Bay, Hawaii. On 25 May, LST-31 left Hawaiian waters, bound for Eniwetok. Upon her arrival at that atoll on 7 June, she refueled and took on cargo in preparation for operations against Saipan. The vessel arrived off Saipan, on 14 June, and began discharging troops and supplies ashore. She cleared the area on 23 June, and returned to Eniwetok to replenish her cargo. LST-31 arrived back at Saipan on 17 July; unloaded supplies and small craft; and, during the next few weeks, served as a hospital ship. At night, she anchored off Saipan to receive casualties and was underway off Tinian, during daylight hours. This assignment occupied the ship through 21 August, when she began a round-trip voyage to Eniwetok. After returning to Saipan, the vessel underwent three days of voyage repairs and got underway on 23 September, for the west coast of the United States. En route, she touched at Eniwetok; Apamama and Makin Islands, Gilbert Islands; and Pearl Harbor. She left the latter port on 6 November, and reached San Francisco on 17 November 1944. After one day in port there, LST-31 sailed to San Pedro, to enter the West Coast Shipbuilding Company yards for extensive alterations and repairs. The ship left the yard in early February 1945, conducted sea trials, and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 18 February, to take on an amphibious craft. She then visited Seattle for additional repair work. On 10 March, the vessel got underway for Hawaii and reached Pearl Harbor on 23 March. LST-31 off-loading over the beach at Okinawa, July 1945. LST-31 left Hawaii on 4 April, for Okinawa. She embarked passengers and loaded supplies at Eniwetok and Guam, before proceeding on to the Ry≈´ky≈´s, and anchoring in waters off southwestern Okinawa on 3 May. She remained in the area for approximately three weeks providing logistic support to troops fighting on Okinawa. The ship arrived at Ulithi on 28 May; took on cargo; and, on 2 June, set a course for the island of Leyte, in the Philippines. During the months of June, July, and August, LST-31 operated between the Philippines and Okinawa, transporting supplies and troops between the two points to build up Okinawa as a base for the conquest of the Japanese home islands. However, this invasion was obviated when Japan capitulated on 15 August. The ship then began moving occupation troops and equipment to Japan from various points in the Philippines. She first arrived in Japanese waters on 15 September, when she dropped anchor in Tokyo Bay. On 30 November, LST-31 was assigned to duty in Japan with the 5th Fleet, Amphibious Group 11, LST Flotilla 35. However, these orders were superseded late in December; and the ship was slated for decommissioning. She was scheduled to be turned over to the Japanese merchant marine to be manned by a Japanese crew under American control for use in repatriating Japanese citizens and shuttling supplies between Japanese ports. Post-war service After the ship was stripped of all armament and other wartime equipment, LST-31 was decommissioned on 8 January 1946, and transferred to the Japanese. The vessel operated under Japanese control into May 1948, when she was returned to US Naval custody. She left Yokohama on 3 May, and shaped a course for the west coast of the United States. The tank landing ship was later berthed in the Seattle area. On 1 July 1955, LST-31 was named Addison County. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 August 1955, and she was subsequently sunk as a target. Awards LST-31 earned five battle stars for her World War II service.

Besides the original comics, the second run of the series also featured material related to Kurtz's fascination with junk culture, including movies, toys, Halloween, UFOs, and a number of other oddball subjects. Credited as Joseph Kurtz, Frank co-wrote and co-directed a horror film titled Carnivore. This feature length film was shot professionally on 16mm over a period of three years. In addition, along with a small crew, he designed and built the full body title monster suit, as well as providing additional make-up special effects along the way. In the mid-1990s, Kurtz was managing editor of the comics-related news magazine HERO Illustrated, published by Sendai Publications. HERO won the 1995 Eisner Award for Best Comics Related Publications. At the same company, later called MVP Media, Kurtz was the editor (as well as writing loads of editorial) for a best selling Roswell UFO Encyclopedia magazine. The magazine caught the attention of the press during the 50th anniversary of the so-called crash, prompting Kurtz to participate in television and radio interviews and talk shows. The magazine itself was seen nationally on network news, including NBC and CNN as well as a number of documentaries on the Roswell subject. Kurtz was also an entertainment news and rumor reporter/editor for Cinescape Online magazine and its website. Kurtz is one of the co-creators and regular contributors of the highly respected, late-lamented Monsterscene magazine. Within the pages of Monsterscene, Kurtz was able to pursue subjects such as Japanese giant monster movies, Mexican horror cinema, and an interview with Bob Burns that was the highlight of his participation there.

This includes a range of alternatives to cells made of semiconducting p-n junctions (\\"first generation\\") and thin film cells (\\"second generation\\"). Common third-generation systems include multi-layer (\\"tandem\\") cells made of amorphous silicon or gallium arsenide, while more theoretical developments include frequency conversion, (i.e. changing the frequencies of light that the cell cannot use to light frequencies that the cell can use - thus producing more power), hot-carrier effects and other multiple-carrier ejection techniques. Emerging photovoltaics include: * Copper zinc tin sulfide solar cell (CZTS), and derivates CZTSe and CZTSSe * Dye-sensitized solar cell, also known as \\"Gr√§tzel cell\\" * Organic solar cell * Perovskite solar cell * Quantum dot solar cell The achievements in the research of perovskite cells, especially, have received tremendous attention in the public as their research efficiencies recently soared above 20 percent. They also offer a wide spectrum of low-cost applications. In addition, another emerging technology, concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), uses high-efficient, multi-junction solar cells in combination with optical lenses and a tracking system.  Technologies  Solar cells can be thought of as visible light counterparts to radio receivers. A receiver consists of three basic parts; an antenna that converts the radio waves (light) into wave-like motions of electrons in the antenna material, an electronic valve that traps the electrons as they pop off the end of the antenna, and a tuner that amplifies electrons of a selected frequency. It is possible to build a solar cell identical to a radio, a system known as an optical rectenna, but to date these have not been practical. The majority of the solar electric market is made up of silicon-based devices. In silicon cells, the silicon acts as both the antenna (or electron donor, technically) as well as the electron valve. Silicon is widely available, relatively inexpensive and has a bandgap that is ideal for solar collection. On the downside it is energetically and economically expensive to produce silicon in bulk, and great efforts have been made to reduce the amount required. Moreover, it is mechanically fragile, which typically requires a sheet of strong glass to be used as mechanical support and protection from the elements. The glass alone is a significant portion of the cost of a typical solar module. According to the Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit, the majority of a cell's theoretical efficiency is due to the difference in energy between the bandgap and solar photon. Any photon with more energy than the bandgap can cause photoexcitation, but any energy above the bandgap energy is lost. Consider the solar spectrum; only a small portion of the light reaching the ground is blue, but those photons have three times the energy of red light. Silicon's bandgap is 1.1 eV, about that of red light, so in this case blue light's energy is lost in a silicon cell. If the bandgap is tuned higher, say to blue, that energy is now captured, but only at the cost of rejecting lower energy photons. It is possible to greatly improve on a single-junction cell by stacking thin layers of material with varying bandgaps on top of each other ‚Äì the \\"tandem cell\\" or \\"multi-junction\\" approach. Traditional silicon preparation methods do not lend themselves to this approach. Thin-films of amorphous silicon have been employed instead, notably Uni-Solar's products, but other issues have prevented these from matching the performance of traditional cells. Most tandem-cell structures are based on higher performance semiconductors, notably gallium arsenide (GaAs). Three-layer GaAs cells achieved 41.6% efficiency for experimental examples.David Biello, \\"New solar- cell efficiency record set\\", Scientific American, 27 August 2009 In September 2013, a four layer cell reached 44.7 percent efficiency. Numerical analysis shows that the \\"perfect\\" single-layer solar cell should have a bandgap of 1.13 eV, almost exactly that of silicon. Such a cell can have a maximum theoretical power conversion efficiency of 33.7% ‚Äì the solar power below red (in the infrared) is lost, and the extra energy of the higher colors is also lost. For a two layer cell, one layer should be tuned to 1.64 eV and the other at 0.94 eV, with a theoretical performance of 44%. A three-layer cell should be tuned to 1.83, 1.16 and 0.71 eV, with an efficiency of 48%. A theoretical \\"infinity- layer\\" cell would have a theoretical efficiency of 68.2% for diffuse light. While the new solar technologies that have been discovered center around nanotechnology, there are several different material methods currently used. The third generation label encompasses multiple technologies, though it includes non-semiconductor technologies (including polymers and biomimetics), quantum dot, tandem/multi-junction cells, intermediate band solar cell, hot- carrier cells, photon upconversion and downconversion technologies, and solar thermal technologies, such as thermophotonics, which is one technology identified by Green as being third generation. It also includes: * Silicon nanostructures * Modifying incident spectrum (concentration), to reach 300‚Äì500 suns and efficiencies of 32% (already attained in Sol3g cellsSol3g secures Triple Junction Solar Cells from Azur Space) to +50%. * Use of excess thermal generation (caused by UV light) to enhance voltages or carrier collection. * Use of infrared spectrum to produce electricity at night.

In 1993, he joined the journalism faculty of the University of Iowa, where he serves as professor and Bessie Dutton Murray Professional Scholar.Professor Stephen Bloom‚Äôs appointment as Bessie Dutton Murray Professional Scholar Bloom has been a visiting scholar at Columbia University's Center for the Study of Society and Medicine and, during the 2011-2012 academic year, he served as the Howard R. Marsh Visiting Professor of Journalism in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan. Writings Bloom has also written a number of short stories, and co-written a play called Shoedog. He wrote the book Postville: A Clash of Cultures in Heartland America, a look at a Chabad hasidic community that moved into a small Midwestern town. His book was heavily criticized in Jewish religious circles as having an anti-religious bias. He has published The Oxford Project with photographer Peter Feldstein. The book consists of a series portraits of residents of Oxford, Iowa, taken 21 years apart with first-person text from the subjects. Tears of the Mermaid, his book about the history of pearls and the people who collect, trade, sell, and obsess over them, was published by St. Martin's Press in 2009. Observations From 20 Years of Iowa Life In December 2011, Bloom wrote an essay entitled \\"Observations From 20 Years of Iowa Life\\" for The Atlantic, characterizing Iowans in terms of his assessment of economic and social challenges facing the state, and questioning whether Iowa's status as the first-in-the-nation caucus is justified. In an e-mail to a fellow faculty member, Bloom said that he submitted the column to more than 40 publications before The Atlantic Online accepted it; among those that rejected it were Politico. He also hoped to appear on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report and John King's show on CNN, appearances that never materialized. In an e-mail of Dec. 11, Bloom said that he was scheduled to appear on Colbert on January 3, the night of the Iowa Caucuses, but the appearance did not materialize. The article provoked outrage from many Iowans, who took offense at Bloom's negative tone, broad stereotypes, and factual errors. The Atlantic ran several corrections, which is \\"unusual,\\" according to the senior editor who accepted Bloom's submitted article, Garance Franke-Ruta. Bloom's article prompted a rebuttal by University of Iowa president Sally Mason (who said \\"he does not speak for the university,\\" described the article as \\"riddled with inaccuracies and factual errors,\\" and said, \\"the Iowa I see is one of strong, hard-working, and creative people\\"), an op-ed by four of Bloom's colleagues in the University of Iowa School of Journalism and Mass Communication detailing their \\"profound and professional disagreement with Professor Bloom concerning the practice of 'good journalism'.'\\" Peter Feldstein, the photographer with whom Bloom collaborated on the book The Oxford Project, wrote an article in the Cedar Rapids Gazette that concluded, \\"I wish Stephen Bloom's name was not on The Oxford Project.\\". Bloom also received almost 250 mails responding to the article on his University of Iowa account; these were made available online to the public after a Freedom of Information Act request by the Iowa City Press- Citizen. After the controversy erupted, Bloom declined interview requests from Iowa Public Radio, the Des Moines Register, and other Iowa press. He did appear on NBC's Rock Center with Brian Williams on January 2, 2012, telling interviewer Willie Geist, \\"...this is the way I do it. This is called satire.

The Abbey of Sainte-Trinit√© (the Holy Trinity), also known as Abbaye aux Dames, is a former convent in Caen, Normandy, now home to the Regional Council of Normandy. The complex includes the Abbey Church of Sainte-Trinit√©. History The abbey was founded as a Benedictine monastery of nuns in the late 11th century by William the Conqueror and his wife Matilda of Flanders as the Abbaye aux Dames (\\"Women's Abbey\\"), as well as the Abbaye aux Hommes (\\"Men's Abbey\\"), formally the Abbey of Saint-√âtienne. The works began in 1062, starting from the rear and finished in 1130. Matilda, who died in 1083, was buried in the choir under a slab of black marble. William and Matilda's son, William II of England, also granted the abbey the manor of Horstead, in Norfolk, where Horstead Priory was established by the order, and continued until 1414. The original spires were destroyed in the Hundred Years' War and replaced by less striking balustrades in the early 18th century. The community of nuns were dispersed and suppressed by the French Revolution. In 1823 the local city council decided to transfer the ancient H√¥tel-Dieu (possibly also founded by William the Conqueror, but more likely King Henry II of England), to the former cloister for use as a hospital, and the canonesses regular, who had assumed responsibility for the hospital from the two abbeys during the 14th century, established themselves there. The canonesses continued to operate there until 1908 when the facility was given to the Hospice Saint- Louis for use as a nursing home. The vault was demolished and rebuilt in 1865. The church was last restored between 1990 and 1993. Burials *Matilda of Flanders *Cecilia of Normandy Architecture Detail of the abbey's stonework. The fa√ßade has two large towers on the sides, each with doors leading to the aisles. The pediment of the central bay echoes the nave roof. The tympanum of the central portal depicts the Trinity and the four apocalyptic beasts, symbols of the Four Evangelists. The nave is surmounted by a gallery (triforium). Over the aisles is a groin vault, the first of this type built in Normandy (1130). The transept, in the centre of the church, houses the main altar. The northern transept is in Romanesque style, opening over a small apse (the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament) which houses the tabernacle. The southern transept is characterised by Gothic columns integrated within the Romanesque decoration. The choir ends with an apse decorated by four columns and a gallery with fantastic figures.

He has published over 30 books in interdisciplinary philosophy, especially on art, literature, ethics, and metaphysics, from American pragmatism through poststructuralism, from human beings to animals and things. Biography He was born May 4, 1935 to Allan Ross and Bessie Schlosberg. He studied mathematics at Columbia University where he received an MA in 1957, and a PhD in philosophy in 1961. He taught philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of Colorado in Boulder before moving to Binghamton University/State University of New York in 1967. He married Marilyn Gaddis Rose in 1968. He spent the rest of his teaching career in Binghamton where he helped create two interdisciplinary PhD programs, one in Philosophy, Literature, and the Theory of Criticism in the Department of Comparative Literature, the second in Philosophy, Interpretation, and Culture (PIC), located first in the Department of Philosophy, later becoming an independent program. He was appointed Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Interpretation, and Culture and of Comparative Literature in 2006. He is currently Alfred North Whitehead Fellow in the European Graduate School, Saas-Fee, Switzerland. He was editor of the journal International Studies in Philosophy from 1979-2011. Work His career has been devoted to different possibilities of expressing and living with uncertain beliefs, unsettled experiences, and inexhaustible realities. He has explored different forms of writing and varied terminologies for expressing what resists expression, based on the conviction that such a resistance requires constant vigilance and innovative writing, the constant production and transformation of forms of knowledge, especially including philosophy, whose relations to art, literature, science, and religion enrich it profoundly with novel and imaginative questions and answers. He began in American pragmatism, reading it to question itself fundamentally and to entail the inexhaustibility of nature and reason, the mysteriousness of things. He wrote several books on ordinality and an ordinal metaphysics, influenced by his mentor, Justus Buchler. He turned then to Alfred North Whitehead and his notion of prehension or perspective. A universe of orders composed of orders composing other orders, of perspectives, is an inexhaustible universe without totality. Everything is limited, including every limit, an inexhaustible play of limit and unlimit. In 2002 he came to believe that such a sense of inexhaustibility required a very different style of writing, more literary and oblique, and found this in post-Heideggerian writings, especially Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, and Deleuze and Guattari. The Ring of Representation was written in sonorous and voiced verbs‚Äîringing, sounding‚Äîavoiding all forms of the verb \\"to be\\" so as to question the question of Being. An ongoing theme throughout his work was that of an infinite ethics, infinite in each decision and inclusive of all things. This led him to Levinas's notions of betrayal and generosity, two notions that would deeply influence his writing. Betraying contains a double meaning, violation and revelation. He linked it with Anaximander's notion of injustice in all things, later defining it as the nonidentity of every identity with itself, a systematic and pervasive sense of how nature and reason exceed themselves, with evolution a foremost example of the first, art and literature of the second. This was followed by seven volumes on gifts and generosity, undercutting the sense of possessing and having that color traditional views of knowledge, truth, and being. Then followed explorations of images in philosophy and art, understanding the world as images, a different way of thinking of perspectives. Images proliferate from other images, revealing and betraying them. This double movement of betraying led to books on enchantment and disenchantment, on asking and telling, to a novel, returning to an infinite and inclusive ethics through animals and other things. These all express a sense of unceasing questioning, and questioning that questioning, that he suggests is profoundly ethical: ethical fullness.

The road runs from Candelaria through the city of Presidio as well as several smaller communities and former settlements to State Highway 118 in Study Butte near Big Bend National Park. The road also passes through the southern portion of Big Bend Ranch State Park. The highway was first designated in 1945 and over the years was gradually extended outward from Presidio.

This spur continued on to connect with the main highway at the present junction of the north end Old Maverick Road and the road to Panther Junction within Big Bend National Park.

At that time, SH 118 south of Alpine departed from its present route near Adobe Walls Mountain to Terlingua rather than going directly to Study Butte as it does today. From Terlingua, SH 118 then proceeded eastward through Study Butte to SH 227. =State Highway Spur 121= 50px In 1941, the designation of SH 118 along the road between Alpine and Terlingua was canceled and returned to county maintenance. The road from Terlingua through Study Butte to SH 227 was re-designated as Spur 121 until that designation was canceled in 1946. The portion within the newly created Big Bend National Park was incorporated into the park's road system. The remainder between Terlingua to the park boundary near Study Butte reverted to county maintenance. =Ranch to Market Road 2462= By 1951, SH 118 had been incrementally extended south of Alpine to the park boundary along its present alignment through Study Butte and over the portion of the former spur road to the park boundary. State maintenance between Terlingua and Study Butte was reestablished as RM 2462 in 1956. RM 2462 was then extended westward to the Presidio County line just west of Lajitas in 1957. Current designation and extensions beyond Presidio FM 170 was originally designated as a highway from US 67 in Presidio northwest to Ochoa. On December 16, 1948, the road was extended to the northwest an additional to Adobes and to the southeast to a point from Presidio. On July 15, 1949, the road was extended to Redford. The road was extended on October 29, 1953 further to the northwest to Pinto Canyon. Further construction to the northwest would then undergo a long hiatus. On July 28, 1955, with construction focusing toward the southeast, the road was extended beyond Redford. On October 31, 1958, the road was extended an additional , and FM 170 was changed to RM 170. On February 5, 1960, RM 170 received its final extension to the southeast to RM 2462 at the Brewster County line. The RM 2462 designation was then canceled with that road combined with RM 170 for a total extension of to its present terminus at SH 118. 40px With southeastward road-building complete, expansion to the northwest resumed on June 2, 1967 with an to Ruidosa. Between 1967 and 1981, RM 170 was changed to FM 170. Ruidosa would remain the northwest terminus for fourteen years until the road was finally extended an additional to its present terminus at Candelaria on October 21, 1981. Also, sometime between June 2, 1967 and October 21, 1981, RM 170 was changed to FM 170. On June 18, 1996, FM 170 was rerouted on Presidio's north side to follow concurrently along the route of US 67 and Bus. US 67-A abandoning a short section of road east of US 67. This was due to the relocation of US 67 away from the town center toward the Presidio- Ojinaga International Bridge with much of US 67's former route through town being replaced by the newly designated Bus. US 67-A, Spur 203, and Spur 310. Route description Ruins of Sacred Heart Mission along FM 170 in Ruidosa FM 170 begins at Candelaria at the termination of the Chispa Road, a rugged, unpaved county road in Presidio and Jeff Davis counties that connects to US 90 by way of FM 2017 between Van Horn and Valentine. Although the two-lane road follows along the Rio Grande between Candelaria and Presidio, the river is largely obscured from the road by farm land. Approximately from Candelaria, the road reaches Ruidosa where the road passes directly by the ruins of an historic adobe Catholic church and intersects the Pinto Canyon Road, an unpaved county road to Marfa by way of RM 2810. Along the remaining to Presidio, the road passes through the former communities or ghost towns of Chinati, Adobes, Indio, and Ochoa. The road merges with US 67 just north of Presidio, the only incorporated city along its route. At a point where Bus. US 67-A separates from US 67, FM 170 follows the business route. At Erma Ave., the route intersects Spur 203 and the route turns south to O'Reilly St. where FM 170 separates from Bus. US 67-A. FM 170 then follows a winding path west along O'Reilly St., then south along Hurd Ave. where it crosses the South Orient Rail Line, then west along Millington Blvd., then south along Fourth St. before leaving the city's street grid to the southwest. Just outside Presidio, FM 170 passes Fort Leaton State Historic Site. The \\"Welcome to Presidio sign\\" West of Redford, FM 170 intersects Casa Piedra Road, an unpaved county route that provides access to the headquarters of Big Bend Ranch State Park and Marfa by way of RM 169. From this point forward to Lajitas, much of the road passes through Big Bend Ranch State Park where the road becomes more mountainous with sharp curves and steep grades. Within the park, there are several campgrounds, picnic areas, trail heads, and an old movie set. The road briefly turns away from the river at Colorado Canyon. At Lajitas, the road permanently turns away from the river to go to Terlingua. Just east of Lajitas is the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Barton Warnock Environmental Education Center. At Terlingua, FM 170 passes near the old ghost town of this former mining community. The road then terminates at Study Butte from the entrance to Big Bend National Park.

Most of the development in Strathearn dates to the 1940s and 1950s. The neighbourhood is bounded on the south west by Connors Road, on the east by 85 Street, and on the north west by the North Saskatchewan River valley. To the north, it overlooks the North Saskatchewan River valley and the river valley neighbourhood of Cloverdale. To the east is the neighbourhood of Holyrood, and to the south west is the neighbourhood of Bonnie Doon. To the south east is the neighbourhood of Idylwyle. Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre and Whyte Avenue are located a short distance to the south of the neighbourhood.  History  Part of the area of Strathearn was annexed by the City of Strathcona in 1907, and became part of the City of Edmonton when Strathcona amalgamated with Edmonton in 1912. The name Strahearn, which is Scottish Gaelic for \\"the valley of the river Earn\\", or \\"the valley of the Irish\\", has been used in Edmonton since 1912Edmonton Bulletin, Nov. 16, 1912 and is likely a reference to the Governor General of the day, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Large lots were subdivided during this period but only a few scattered houses were actually constructed. After World War II Edmonton's city planners replotted the area and development began in earnest. Most of the structures in the neighbourhood date from 1948 to 1954. Extension of Connors Road to the Bonnie Doon Traffic Circle in the early 1960s clearly defined the neighbourhood's boundary with Bonnie Doon.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Strathearn had a population of living in dwellings, a -0.9% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.  Housing  A home overlooking the North Saskatchewan River valley from Strathearn Drive. According to the 2001 federal census, one in ten (9.7%) of residences were constructed prior to the end of World War II. Just over half the residences (52.5%) were constructed between the end of the war and 1960. One in seven residences (15%) were built during the 1970s and one in five (20.1%) were built during the 1980s. Residential construction in the neighbourhood was substantially complete by 1990. The most common type of residence in Strathearn, according to the 2005 municipal census, is the single-family dwelling. Single-family dwellings account for just under half (44%) of all the residences in the neighbourhood. Another one in three (36%) are rented apartments in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories. One in five (20%) are rented apartments in high-rise buildings with five or more stories. In total, two out of three residences (66%) are rented.  Amenities  Shops and services are found in the Strathearn Centre strip mall and at two other smaller commercial sites (a fourth commercially zoned site, formerly occupied by a gas station/convenience store, now sits vacant). There are three parks within the neighbourhood‚Äîthe school grounds, Silver Heights Park and Strathearn Park‚Äîand three churches: Strathearn United Church, Assumption Catholic Church and the Bonnie Doon Stake Centre of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other amenities include tree-lined streets and the scenic view of downtown Edmonton from Strathearn Drive.  Schools  Most elementary-aged students living in Strathearn attend the nearby Holyrood or Rutherford schools. Strathearn Elementary/Junior School was a fixture in the neighbourhood from the early 1950s until 2005, when the Edmonton Public School Board closed it, citing declining enrollment.Edmonton Journal, 14 May 2005, p. B4. In September 2006, the √âcole publique Gabrielle-Roy, a francophone school run by the Conseil scolaire Centre-Nord, opened in the building that had housed Strathearn School.Edmonton Journal, 6 Sep 2006, p. B1.  Transportation  Strathearn residents have a variety of transportation options in addition to the car. Downtown and services and institutions in adjacent neighbourhoods and at Bonnie Doon Mall are within walking distance. Cyclists have access to a large portion of central Edmonton plus the network of trails in the river valley system. The neighbourhood is served by bus routes on Connors Road, 95 Avenue, 85 Street and 92 Street. In December 2009 Edmonton City Council approved a southeast LRT alignment that would run through Strathearn on Connors Road, 95 Avenue and 85 Street.  Community league  The Strathearn Community League is a neighbourhood organization established in 1953. The league's original impetus was to provide local recreational opportunities. In cooperation with the City of Edmonton it built a playground, skating rink and associated rink shack/league hall in Silver Heights Park at the centre of the neighbourhood, and organized child sports teams. More recently the league has become involved in social matters (it sponsored a preschool from the mid-1990s until 2005) and has been active in urban planning matters within and near its boundaries.Edmonton Journal, 28 Jun 2007, p.

The construction of the church began in the late 17th century and it opened in 1690. Due to renovations and reconstruction, the current structure dates back to 1907. The church is noted for containing stained glass windows that were donated by Charles de Gaulle. History In 1668, French settlers began inhabiting the islands, bringing their Catholic faith along with them. Construction of the cathedral most likely started after this time and it was completed in 1690. The building remained standing until November 1902, when it was obliterated‚Äîalong with the majority of the town‚Äîin the Great Fire, which originated from the cathedral. St. Pierre was subsequently rebuilt from 1905 to 1907 using Basque-style architecture. Architecture=Exterior St. Pierre Cathedral was built in the Basque style of architecture and is noted for its mixture of European and local Saint-Pierrais features in its design. This is demonstrated in the church's incorporation of Alsatian sandstone and native pink granite. When the cathedral was rebuilt in 1905, the reconstruction used cement‚Äîan innovative construction material at the time. However, this did not withstand the elements well and resulted in damage to the exterior walls. As a result, restoration was undertaken in 1975, with the belfry being completely rebuilt. Stained glass windows The church contains both early 20th century and modern stained glass windows. The former depicts saints from France‚ÄîSt. Marguerite Marie Alacoque, St. Bernadette and Our Lady of Lourdes‚Äîas well as the cathedral's namesake in Montmartre, whose architectural style was emulated by the cathedral. The modern windows were given by Charles de Gaulle during his 1967 visit to the overseas territory. These show scenes from the Gospel involving the sea and ships‚Äîa symbol of the islands depicted on their unofficial flag‚Äîas well as Pope John XXIII convening the Second Vatican Council.

It was first published in the October 1956 issue of Satellite Science Fiction and reprinted in the 1957 collection Earth Is Room Enough. It is Asimov's only science fiction story set in Idaho. Plot summary \\"The Watery Place\\" is narrated by the unnamed deputy sheriff of Twin Gulch, Idaho, who opens the story by explaining that humanity will never achieve space travel. This, he says, is due to his boss, Sheriff Bart Cameron. The deputy explains that Cameron is an impatient man generally, and becomes particularly impatient when he's working on his income taxes. It was the world's bad fortune that the first extraterrestrials to land on Earth happened to arrive in Twin Gulch, Idaho on the evening of 14 April 1956. The deputy sees a flying saucer land while staring out the window of the sheriff's office, and sees the two occupants approach. The aliens look perfectly human, and are dressed in ordinary business suits. The deputy notes, \\"I would have thought they were city fellows if I hadn't seen the flying saucer land in the scrub.\\" Cameron is too busy working on his taxes to notice the landing. The aliens enter and explain to Cameron that they have chosen to make first contact with humanity in Twin Gulch because it is isolated and peaceful, and that they have chosen Cameron to make first contact with because he is the local leader. \\"We come from the watery place your people call Venus.\\" They want Cameron's help contacting the leaders of the United States of America. This sets Cameron off. He storms at them, calls them wise-guy jerks, and threatens to lock them up for disturbing the peace. He finishes by saying, \\"Get the hell out of here and back to wherever you're from and don't ever come back. I don't want to see you and no one else around here does.\\" The alien can tell that Cameron is serious, so he says that he will leave, and see to it that nobody ever returns and that Cameron's people will never have to leave. The deputy can tell that he means it, and that humanity will be fenced in on Earth forever. After the aliens leave, the outraged deputy drags Cameron over to the window and makes him watch as the flying saucer takes off. He asks why Cameron sent them away. When Cameron says he thought they were just foreigners, the deputy reminds him that they said they were from Venus. Cameron responds, \\"Venus!

Since 2000, the company has been a fully owned subsidiary of the Swiss luxury group Richemont. Jaeger-LeCoultre is regarded as a top-tier Richemont brand. It has hundreds of inventions, patents and over one thousand movements to its name, including the world's smallest movement, one of the world's most complicated wristwatches (Grande Complication), and a timepiece of near-perpetual movement (the Atmos clock).  History = Early history  Monument of Antoine LeCoultre The earliest records of the LeCoultre family in Switzerland date from the 16th century, when Pierre LeCoultre (circa 1530 ‚Äì circa 1600), a French Huguenot, fled to Geneva from Lisy-sur-Ourcq, France to escape religious persecution. In 1558, he obtained the status of ‚Äúinhabitant‚Äù but left the following year to acquire a plot of land in the Vall√©e de Joux. Over time, a small community formed and in 1612, Pierre LeCoultre's son built a church there, marking the founding of the village of Le Sentier where the company's Manufacture is still based today. In 1833, following his invention of a machine to cut watch pinions from steel, Antoine LeCoultre (1803-1881) founded a small watchmaking workshop in Le Sentier, where he honed his horological skills to create high-quality timepieces. In 1844, he invented the world's most precise measuring instrument at the time, the Millionom√®tre, and in 1847 he created a keyless system to rewind and set watches. Four years later, he was awarded a gold medal for his work on timepiece precision and Mechanization at the first Universal Exhibition in London. In 1866, at a time when watchmaking skills were divided up among hundreds of small workshops, Antoine and his son, Elie LeCoultre (1842-1917), established the Vall√©e de Joux's first full-fledged manufacture, LeCoultre & Cie., pooling their employees‚Äô expertise under one roof. Under this set-up, they developed in 1870 the first partially mechanised production processes for complicated movements. By the same year, the Manufacture employed 500 people and was known as the ‚ÄúGrande Maison of the Vall√©e de Joux‚Äù, and by 1900, it had created over 350 different calibres, of which 128 were equipped with chronograph functions and 99 with repeater mechanisms. From 1902 and for the next 30 years, LeCoultre & Cie. produced most of the movement blanks for Patek Philippe of Geneva.  Re-organization  Share of the SA de la Fabrique d'Horlogerie LeCoultre & Cie, issued 30. June 1899In 1903, Paris-based watchmaker to the French Navy, Edmond Jaeger, challenged Swiss manufacturers to develop and produce the ultra-thin movements that he had invented. Jacques-David LeCoultre, Antoine's grandson who was responsible for production at LeCoultre & Cie., accepted the challenge, giving rise to a collection of ultra-thin pocket watches, including the thinnest in the world in 1907, equipped with the LeCoultre Calibre 145. The same year, French jeweller Cartier, one of Jaeger's clients, signed a contract with the Parisian watchmaker under which all Jaeger movements for a period of fifteen years would be exclusive to Cartier. The movements were produced by LeCoultre. Edmond Jaeger also acquired the patent for the atmospherically driven clock Atmos from its inventor Jean-L√©on Reutter and licensed it to LeCoultre from 1936 for France, and in 1937 for Switzerland. The collaboration between Jaeger and LeCoultre led to the company being officially renamed Jaeger-LeCoultre in 1937. Before that, LeCoultre of Switzerland and Jaeger of France also formed a company in England, Ed. Jaeger (London) Limited, in 1921 to make instruments for prestige car manufacturers. In 1927 Jaeger LeCoultre sold 75 per cent of the company to S Smith & Sons and in 1937 the company name was changed to British Jaeger Instruments Limited.John Glanville and William M Wolmuth, Clockmaking in England and Wales in the Twentieth Century: The Industrialised Manufacture of Domestic Clocks, Crowood Press 2015 The 1930 Bentley Speed Six also features gauges made by Jaeger and a clock by S. Smith & Sons.  Recent development  From 1932 to approximately 1985, due to the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act, watches were cased in locally produced cases in North America and sold under the name LeCoultre by the company Vacheron-LeCoultre, a subsidiary of Longines-Wittnauer, with slightly different case designs. After 1985, Jaeger-LeCoultre was adopted uniformly worldwide. According to factory records, the last movement to be used in an American LeCoultre watch was shipped out of Le Sentier in 1976. Some collectors and misinformed dealers have made the erroneous claim that American LeCoultre is not associated with Jaeger-LeCoultre Switzerland. The confusion stems from the 1950s, when the North American distributor of LeCoultre watches was the Longines-Wittnauer Group, which was also responsible for the distribution of Vacheron Constantin timepieces. Collectors have confused this distribution channel with the manufacture of the watches. According to Jaeger-LeCoultre enthusiast Zaf Basha, the \\"Galaxy\\", an upmarket mysterious dial diamond watch, is a collaboration between Vacheron & Constantin and LeCoultre for the American market. It features ‚ÄúLeCoultre‚Äù on the front and ‚ÄúVacheron & Constantin ‚Äî LeCoultre‚Äù stamped on the case. The LeCoultre trademark expired in 1985 and was replaced by the Jaeger-LeCoultre trademark.  Watch manufacturing = Notable inventions and patents  Speedometer 1934 Talbot 105 Since Jaeger- LeCoultre's founding, the company has produced over 1,242 different calibres, registered approximately 400 patents and created hundreds of inventions. * In 1844, Antoine LeCoultre invented the Millionom√®tre, which was the first instrument in history capable of measuring the micron, allowing for the precise manufacture of watch parts. The invention was never patented, as no such system existed in Switzerland at the time. However, its unique composition was kept a closely guarded secret, used by the company for more than fifty years. It was presented at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900. * In 1847, Antoine invented a keyless watch, the second simple and reliable winding and time-setting system to do without a key after Patek Philippe's version of 1845.Stacy Perman: A Grand Complication: The Race to Build the World's Most Legendary Watch. Simon and Schuster, 2013. p. 155. . Instead, it relied on a small push-piece that activated a lever to change over from one function to another. Again, the invention was not patented, allowing other watchmakers to quickly implement the system. * In 1866, for the first time in watchmaking history, LeCoultre & Cie. began to manufacture calibres with small complications in small series, and in 1891 combined the chronograph and minute repeater complications into a double complication calibre. This subsequently led in the mid-1890s to the production of grandes complications, or watches comprising at least three classic horological complications, such as a perpetual calendar, chronograph and minute repeater. In 2004, the Manufacture created the Gyrotourbillon I, its first grande complication wristwatch, featuring a tourbillon gravitating on two axes, along with a perpetual calendar with double retrograde indicators and a running equation of time. In 2006, it released the Reverso grande complication √† triptyque, the first watch in history to be equipped with three dials driven by a single movement, and in 2009 the company produced one of the world's most complicated wristwatches, the Hybris Mechanica √† Grande Sonnerie with 26 complications. * In 1907, the LeCoultre Calibre 145 set the record for the world's thinnest movement at 1.38 mm thick, appearing in pocket watches that remain to this day the thinnest in their category. From 1907 until the 1960s, the movement was produced in some 400 copies.  Environmental rating  Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Jaeger-LeCoultre, along with 3 other manufacturers including Vacheron Constantin and Cartier, was given an average environmental rating as \\"Upper Midfield\\", suggesting that the manufacturer has taken first actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change. In jewelry and watchmaking industry, there are general concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies.  Notable models = Reverso  complication and power reserve indicator Its name inspired by the Latin ‚ÄúI turn around‚Äù, the Reverso was created in 1931 as a watch capable of surviving the hard knocks of a polo game: The origin of the watch creation is rooted n the early 1930s when a group of Polo players asked C√©sar de Trey, a watch dealer, to create a timepiece that could withstand the rigours of their sport. C√©sar de Trey followed up on the request with a letter to his colleague and watch manufacturer, Jacques-David LeCoultre. Ren√©-Alfred Chauvot, was a French engineer with LeCoultre, and was engaged to develop this new watchcase. Mr. Chauvot designed a reversible case that could protect the fragile dial and glass of the watch. The final design, that is still in use today, allows for the case to be swivelled in its carrier to protect the watch glass. The design is considered a classic of Art Deco A list of notable watches from the Reverso line include the following: * The Reverso Classic Large Duoface Small Second, available in stainless steel. * The Reverso Tribute Small Seconds Burgundy Red, available in stainless steel. * The Grande Reverso Ultra Thin Tribute to 1931, available in stainless steel.  Duoplan In 1925, the LeCoultre Calibre 7BF Duoplan was created in an effort to bring together miniaturisation and precision. The fashion of the period was for small wristwatches, however small calibres often suffered from a loss of reliability. Created by Henri Rodanet, the technical director of Etablissements Ed. Jaeger, the Duoplan was built on two levels ‚Äì hence its name ‚Äì enabling it to maintain a large-size balance. The Duoplan was also one of the first gem-set steel watches and, in 1929, its glass was replaced with sapphire crystal, a first in watchmaking. The Duoplan was ensured by Lloyd's of London with a special after-sales service, and a damaged movement could be replaced in a few minutes, leading London-based store owner Tyme to display in its shop window: ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have time to finish your cigarette before your watch is repaired‚Äù.  Joaillerie 101  The Duoplan led to the creation in 1929 of the world's still-smallest mechanical movement, the Calibre 101, whose 74 original parts (98 today) weighed a total of approximately one gram. The second family of watches equipped with the Calibre 101, Joaillerie 101 √âtrier appeared in the 1930s. In 1953, Elizabeth II of England wore a Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 101 wristwatch for her coronation.  Atmos  The Atmos The Atmos Clock is a timepiece of near-perpetual movement needing no human intervention and almost no energy. Invented by Swiss engineer Jean-L√©on Reutter in 1928 in Neuch√¢tel, the Atmos clock has been the Swiss government's official gift for important guests since 1950. Patented in 1928, the first version ‚Äì known today as the Atmos 1 ‚Äì was marketed by La Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Radiologie (CGR) in 1930. It derives energy from small temperature and atmospheric pressure changes in the environment, and can run for years without human intervention. Wound by a capsule filled with a mixture of temperature-sensitive gases, a 1 ¬∞C fluctuation is enough to store sufficient energy to supply the clock with two days' autonomy. Its balance, suspended from a steel-alloy wire thinner than a hair, performs two vibrations per minute; its gearing requires no lubricant. The Atmos' gearing is known for its accuracy: the moon-phase model, for example, accumulates a one-day discrepancy only once every 3,821 years. The patents were subsequently purchased by Jaeger-LeCoultre in France 1936 and in Switzerland in 1937. The company then spent ten years perfecting the clock before beginning to manufacture it in its current technological form in 1946. In 1988, the Kohler and Rekow design agency created a two-piece limited edition showcase for the clock and, in 2003, the Manufacture released the Atmos Myst√©rieuse, driven by the Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 583 and comprising 1,460 parts.  Futurematic  In 1951, the Manufacture released the Futurematic, the world's first 100% automatic watch, the calibre 497, Calibre 497 debuted with the Jaeger-LeCoultre Futurematic and was much more advanced than the earlier JLC 476 and JLC 481. It features a larger balance for improved accuracy and hacking seconds. One unique feature is a lock that holds the swinging weight in place when the mainspring is fully wound. It also features a special 6 hour power reserve, allowing the watch to immediately function when it is put on, rather than requiring it to be wound first. The Calibre 497 featured a power reserve indicator along with small seconds located at the unusual position of 3:00. Calibre 817 was used in the Jaeger- LeCoultre Futurematic and was a modification of the existing Calibre 497. Like that movement, it has a power reserve indicator at 9:00 and small seconds 3:00, but in Cal. 817 and Cal. 837 these are tiny round windows rather than being full subdials. Calibre 827 returned to the full subdial format, Calibres 817, 827, and 837 were produced from 1956 through 1958, with just 3,500 movements made. About 3,000 of Cal. 817, 1,000 of Cal. 827, and just 500 of Cal. 837 were made. Approximately 52,500 examples of Calibre 497 were produced between 1951 and 1958. It has been said that the whole project for the Futurematic almost made the company bankrupt, as they never fully recovered their investment from sales of the Futurematic series of watches.  Memovox  Memovox In 1950, the Manufacture released the Memovox (portmanteau of memoria and vox, ‚Äúvoice of memory‚Äù), a year after the model cricket was released by Vulcain. Its striking mechanism could be used as an alarm for waking up, appointments, timetables, etc. The first models were hand wound and equipped with the Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 489. In 1956, a Memovox featuring the Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 815 became the first self-winding alarm watch in history, while shortly thereafter the company marked its 125th anniversary by releasing the Memovox Wordtime. In 1959, the Memovox Deep Sea was equipped with a specific alarm to remind divers to begin their ascension, and in 1965, the Memovox Polaris was released with a patented triple case back to optimise the transmission of sound under water. The latter model would go on to inspire the current Master Compressor and AMVOX lines. It was reproduced in 2008 under the name Memovox Tribute to Polaris.  Geophysic  Jaeger-Lecoultre 285x285pxIn honour of the International Geophysical Year in 1958, Jaeger- LeCoultre created a watch protected against magnetic fields, water and shocks. The Geophysic chronometer was proposed by long-time employee Jules-C√©sar Savary as a watch intended for scientific bases in Antarctica. The watch was fitted with the Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 478BWS and featured seventeen jewels, a Breguet overcoil, a regulating spring on the balance-cock, a shock-absorber and a Glucydur balance. The year of its release, the Geophysic was offered to William R. Anderson, the captain of the Nautilus, the first American nuclear submarine to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans via the North Pole.  Grand Complication  JLC produces some complicated watches (Grand complication), e.g. the Master Gyrotourbillon 1Master Gyrotourbillon 1 (WatchAdvisor - YouTube) with a spherical Tourbillon. The Duom√®tre Sph√©rotourbillon is equipped with a tourbillon adjustable to the nearest second; the Reverso R√©p√©tition Minutes √† Rideau is equipped with a minute- repeater shutter as a third face covering one of its two dials; the Master Grande Tradition Grande Complication is equipped with a flying tourbillon that follows the rhythm of celestial phenomena and indicates sidereal time, and a minute repeater comprising cathedral gongs; the Hybris Mechanica √† Grande Sonnerie is equipped with gongs capable of playing the entire Big Ben chime; the Reverso Gyrotourbillon 2 is equipped with a spherical tourbillon principle, a reversible case and a cylindrical balance; the Master Compressor Extreme LAB is oil-free; the Gyrotourbillon 1 is equipped with a tourbillon evolving in three dimensions to compensate for the effects of gravity in all positions.

In 2004, Jaeger-LeCoultre teamed with Aston Martin to launch the Aston Martin Jaeger-LeCoultre gentleman's watch - the AMVOX1. The design of the timepiece was inspired by a 70-year historical link between the two companies. The dashboard of the 1930s, 1.5-litre Aston Martin LM ‚Äì a regular class winner in international motorsport ‚Äì contained instruments created by Jaeger-LeCoultre. In October 2011, the Responsible Jewellery Council announced that Jaeger-LeCoultre had obtained certification for its commitment to human rights and for meeting the ethical, social and environmental standards established by the RJC's Member Certification system. In 2012, in partnership with the Italian luxury leathergoods brand Valextra, Jaeger-LeCoultre began offering a two-tone version of its ladies‚Äô Reverso watch. Jaeger-LeCoultre and the International Herald Tribune have joined forces with UNESCO's World Heritage Centre in support of the World Heritage Marine Programme. The partnership provides funding and media exposure for one of the World Heritage Committee's priority programmes, leading to the listing of new marine sites and protection measures for the 46 sites already listed. Each year, the programme as well as the sites are featured in print and online news articles by the International Herald Tribune, thus offering increased visibility to the partnership. In addition, the company partners with the Venice Film Festival to present the Jaeger-LeCoultre Glory to the Filmmaker Award.

Instead, borrowers are simply asked to state their income, and taken at their word. These loans are sometimes called liar loans or liar's loans. Agency Sounds Warning On Stated-Income And Interest-Only Mortgages, Realty Times, January 10, 2005 Stated income loans were originated by Ameriquest. Reasons for stated income loans These loans are nominally intended for self-employed borrowers, or other borrowers who might have difficulty documenting their income. Stated income loans have been extended to customers with a wide range of credit histories, including subprime borrowers. The lack of verification makes these loans particularly simple targets for fraud.'Liar Loans' Contribute to Mortgage Problems, NPR, March 17, 2007 Stated income loans fill a gap of situations which normal loan standards would not approve. For example, a standard rule is that a customer's mortgage and other loan payments should take up no more than 45% of the person's income. This would seem prudent for a person just owning their main home. However, a real estate investor may have multiple properties and for each may receive only a small amount more than their loan payments on each house, but end up with $200,000 in disposable income. Nevertheless, a non- stated income loan would decline this person since their debt to income ratio would not be in line. The same issue can arise with self-employed borrowers, where the bank with a fully documented loan would include the borrower's business debt in their debt to income calculation. Stated income loans also help borrowers where fully documented loans normally would not consider the source of income as being reliable and stable, such as investors who consistently earn capital gains. Fully documented loans also do not consider potential future income increases. Another type of loan that uses the same principles is the no income disclosure loan. In August 2006, Steven Krystofiak, president of the Mortgage Brokers Association for Responsible Lending, in a statement at a Federal Reserve hearing on mortgage regulation, reported that his organization had compared a sample of 100 stated income mortgage applications to IRS records, and found almost 60% of the sampled loans had overstated their income by more than 50 percent.Steven Krystofiak, , statement at a Federal Reserve, August 1, 2006, cited in Mark Gimein, Inside the Liar Loan: How the Mortgage Industry Nurtured Deceit, Slate Magazine, April 24, 2008 In 2010, the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, restricting stated income loans, went into effect. Section 1411 of the Act states: \\"A creditor making a residential mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability...\\"Section 1411 of Financial Reform Bill, , August 2010 Currently, lenders are conducting their own version of income and asset verification. Stated income loans are still offered typically by small local banks. Qualification requirements are based on stable employment, good reserves, good FICO and no less than 40% equity position in the property. Stated income loan availability changes state to state, county to county.  See also  * Alt-A mortgage * William K. Black * Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 References Further reading  * Kenneth R.

The Westernhagens are members of an old Thuringian nobility and originated in Lower Saxony. The first reference to the family was made in 1258. The original family name was von Hagen. The family acquired a fiefdom in 1283 and built Westernhagen Castle in Berlingerode, from which their name derives. History The family is first mentioned in 1258 with Conradus and Hermannus Indagine (Latin for Hagen meaning hague, an area fortified and fenced with a hedge). With the latter Hermannus, an uninterrupted ancestry line begins. The name changed from de Indagine, Hayn, Hagen to Westernhagen. Already in 1123 (however first mentioned in documents in 1288) the lords of Berlingerode in the Eichsfeld district built the old moated Castle Hagen (Westernhagen Castle) near Berlingerode. Around 1300 some relatives, probably tribally related to the lords of Berlingerode, built Castle Osternhagen (Eastern Hagen) at Hundeshagen. Some later members of this family named themselves after the old moated castle of Western Hagen, when they had moved there. Westernhagen Castle was destroyed in 1525 during the German Peasants' War. The main seat of the family, among other properties, became nearby Teistungen, which they had owned since 1283 and where they had built two tower houses that were later replaced by manor houses. The family converted from Catholicism to Protestantism after the Reformation in the sixteenth century. Members of the family served in the Prussian military under Frederick the Great. In the twentieth century, most of the family properties were seized by the Communist government of East Germany. After the German reunification, the Oberhof manor and estate in Teistungen was re-purchased by Burghard von Westernhagen, the father of Princess Heinrich of Hanover.

For thirty four years she ran Mary Baldwin College, which was named in her honor in 1895 and later became Mary Baldwin University. Early and family life Born to Margaret Sarah Sowers Baldwin Heiskell (1810 - 1855) and her husband William Daniel Baldwin (1803-1830) in Winchester, Virginia at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley on October 4, 1829, Mary Julia Baldwin never knew her father, who died when she was a baby. Raised by her maternal grandparents in Staunton, Virginia after her mother remarried, in 1842 Mary became a member of the first class of sixty girls at the Augusta Female Seminary. Local Presbyterian ministers had organized it and the Virginia General Assembly incorporated it on January 30, 1845.History p. 15 After four years of studies, Mary Baldwin graduated at the top of her class. Baldwin suffered a high fever as a child that permanently twisted and paralyzed the left side of her face. She never married, nor permitted a photograph or portrait to be made of her. An animal lover, she had numerous pets including two dogs (Midget and Beauty), who followed her around campus. Career After graduation, Mary Baldwin taught Sunday school for young women, and another class for African American children. She also taught her grandmother's slaves to read and write. During the American Civil War, the Augusta Female Seminary faced closure when its principal and his two daughters (both teachers) relocated to Texas. The remaining trustees persuaded Baldwin (then operating a local school a year after her grandmother's death) to assume its leadership as principal in August 1863, with her long-time friend Agnes McClung as matron.History pp. 29-33 Baldwin borrowed furniture, books, and supplies for her pupils, and asked them to pay tuition (and for some room and board) with food and fuel. They also used various ruses to preserve their supplies from various military raiding parties.History pp. 33-37 Thus, unlike the other three schools in town (and most other Southern schools), the female academy remained open during the conflict. After the war, aided by William Holmes McGuffey, professor of moral philosophy at the University of Virginia, and brother of teacher Eliza Howard, Baldwin improved the school's curriculum. It came to include rhetoric, composition, higher mathematics, chemistry and physics, as well as topics traditionally taught to well-bred women such as music, visual arts, and elocution. Baldwin wanted it to become a college or even university (as would happen after her death). The curriculum also offered practical courses in bookkeeping, nutrition, and calisthenics. Death and legacy She died at her campus home on 1897 and was buried in Thornrose Cemetery in Staunton. The Virginia General Assembly had renamed the school in her honor in 1895,History p. 53 nearly two decades after former students had donated sculptures of her beloved dogs, which were sometimes renamed and became the subject of several campus traditions. During her lifetime, Baldwin accumulated and improved about ten acres of land, which she left to the college. Her estate of about $250,000 was divided among the college, her church and her relatives. The college also preserved her home, and is currently renovating some of the furnishings she left.. By 1922, the school was fully accredited and renamed \\"Mary Baldwin College.\\" The Library of Virginia honored Baldwin as a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History in 2000.

The school serves students in grades 9-12 and has an approximate student population of 930 students. It is the only high school serving the town of Pembroke. Students come directly from Pembroke Community Middle School (PCMS). The three elementary schools in the town include Hobomock Elementary, Bryantville Elementary, and North Pembroke Elementary School. History Pembroke High School was formed in 2004 when the town of Pembroke split away from the Silver Lake Regional School District over concerns about overcrowding, and that Pembroke consisted of half of the population of the then four town district. The building was constructed as the Pembroke campus of the Silver Lake Regional High School and opened in October 1976, and was subsequently the Silver Lake District's middle school. Pembroke's middle school is located on Rte. 27, and was the Silver Lake Junior High School from 1968 to 1991, when the district's middle school shifted to the Learning Lane building.

The prison was built to house 220 prisoners in the pre-independence era and now holds around 2,000 prisoners. Many prisoners were subject to prolonged stays in holding cells because of a massive backlog in court cases. History Formal incarceration resulting from criminal offences in Sierra Leone began in 1787. At that time, abandoned slave ships were used as makeshift prisons. The first purpose built prison building in the country was built in Freetown, at the location of the current State House, the official residence and principal workplace of the President of Sierra Leone. Some years later, the prison was moved to a new location in the city, which is currently the location of the Connaught Hospital. The present Freetown Central Prison, located on Pademba Road, was founded on 14 March 1914, by the British colonial authorities. In 2010, a number of high security prisoners, including those convicted of murder and armed robbery, escaped from the prison, precipitating a manhunt. Prison officers claimed an official figure of 19 escapees, although some eye witnesses claimed the number was 30. The escapees were armed with a pistol, which they fired close to the prison's main gate, causing the guards to flee. They then escaped through the main gate, during the day. National director of jails, Moses Showers, was sacked following the break out and 18 people, including prison officers, were arrested. In 2013, with the prison population sitting at over 1000, against a design capacity of just 300 inmates, the government initiated proposals to relocate it.

A pharmacist is looking at a liquid solution. Clinical pharmacy is the branch of pharmacy in which clinical pharmacists provide direct patient care that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention. Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics. Clinical pharmacists often work in collaboration with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other healthcare professionals. Clinical pharmacists can enter into a formal collaborative practice agreement with another healthcare provider, generally one or more physicians, that allows pharmacists to prescribe medications and order laboratory tests. Education and credentialing Clinical pharmacists have extensive education in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, socio-behavioural and clinical sciences. Most clinical pharmacists have a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree and many have completed one or more years of post-graduate training (for example, a general and/or specialty pharmacy residency). In the United States, clinical pharmacists can choose to become Board-certified through the Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS), which was organized in 1976 as an independent certification agency of the American Pharmacists Association. The BPS certifies pharmacists in the following specialties: *Ambulatory care pharmacy (BCACP) *Critical care pharmacy (BCCCP) *Nuclear pharmacy (BCNP) *Nutrition support pharmacy (BCNSP) *Oncology pharmacy (BCOP) *Pediatric pharmacy (BCPPS) *Geriatric pharmacy (BCGP) *Pharmacotherapy (BCPS) *Infectious disease pharmacy (BCIDP) *Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy (BCSCP) *Cardiology pharmacy (BCCP) *Transplant Pharmacist (BCTXP) *Psychiatric pharmacy (BCPP) There are several types of clinical pharmacists in the United States. In California they are called advanced practice pharmacists (APh). In New Mexico, they are known as Pharmacist Clinicians (PhC) and lastly in Montana and North Carolina they are known as Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners (CPP). Clinical pharmacists in the Veteran Administration are known as Clinical Pharmacy Specialists (CPS). Role in the health care system Within the system of health care, clinical pharmacists are experts in the therapeutic use of medications. They routinely provide medication therapy evaluations and recommendations to patients and other health care professionals. Clinical pharmacists are a primary source of scientifically valid information and advice regarding the safe, appropriate, and cost-effective use of medications. Clinical pharmacists are also making themselves more readily available to the public. In the past, access to a clinical pharmacist was limited to hospitals, clinics, or educational institutions. However, clinical pharmacists are making themselves available through a medication information hotline, and reviewing medication lists, all in an effort to prevent medication errors in the foreseeable future. In the United Kingdom, clinical pharmacists are routinely involved in the direct care of patients within hospitals, and increasingly, in doctors surgeries. They also develop post registration professional education, professional curricula for workforce development, provide expertise on the use of medicines to national organizations such as NICE, the Department of Health, and the MHRA, and develop medicines guidelines for use in therapeutic areas. Clinical pharmacists interact directly with patients in several different ways. They use their knowledge of medication (including dosage, drug interactions, side effects, expense, effectiveness, etc.) to determine if a medication plan is appropriate for their patient. If it is not, the pharmacist will consult the primary physician to ensure that the patient is on the proper medication plan. The pharmacist also works to educate their patients on the importance of taking and finishing their medications. Studies conducted into Pharmacist-led Chronic Disease Management show that it was associated with effects similar to usual care and might improve physiological goal attainment. In some states, clinical pharmacists are given prescriptive authority under protocol with a medical provider, and their scope of practice is constantly evolving. In the United Kingdom clinical pharmacists are given independent prescriptive authority. Basic components of clinical pharmacy practice include prescribing drugs, administering drugs, monitoring prescriptions, managing drug use, and counselling patients.

The scheme was similar to the way banks were required to withhold an amount at a set rate on interest earned on bank deposits before it is paid to the account holder. In general, this payment meant that the recipients of the dividend were considered to have already paid basic rate tax on the dividend income. Non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, who would not otherwise have paid income tax on the dividend income, became entitled to claim a refund of the ACT amount, or after 1993 a lesser amount. The refund of ACT for non-taxpayers was scrapped in 1997, and in 1999 the ACT was itself scrapped, effectively making dividend income of non-taxpayers tax-free again. The amount of ACT paid by a company could also be offset against the company's profits reducing its final corporation tax bill. The ACT was scrapped in 1999.  History  Until 1973, company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies were required to withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits.Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 ‚Äì ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction, HMRC.

Retrieved 12 April 2007 Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount. When introduced in 1973, the ACT rate on the gross dividend (the amount distributed plus the ACT withheld) was 30%, the basic rate of income tax at the time. Until 1993 the income tax rate payable on dividends was the same as all other income, and the ACT rate was adjusted to align it to changes in the basic rate of income tax. From April 1993, the ACT rate was cut to 22.5% while the tax rate on dividend income was set at 20%, the first time it was set at a different rate to that payable on other income (25%). The tax credit was tied to the 20% rate rather than the ACT rate of 22.5%, meaning that non-taxpayers could no longer claim a refund for the full amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The ACT rate was cut to 20% from April 1994. In 1997, the tax credit was scrapped for non-taxpayers (except charities and PEPs), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.That pensions raid, Evan Davis 2 April 2007. The Times obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act in April 2007 that showed the chancellor Gordon Brown had been advised that pension funds would suffer a ¬£67 billion loss of the actuarial value of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.Gloomy predictions that the Chancellor chose to ignore - Times Online ACT was scrapped from 6 April 1999,HM Revenue & Customs: A modern system for corporation tax payments and replaced by a tax credit on dividend income of 10%.

He is otherwise notable in relation to the tangled marital history of his mother, the Marchioness Townshend. Life Baptised John Townshend on 26 December 1823 at St. George's, Bloomsbury, he was the eldest surviving son of the brewer John Margetts and the heiress Sarah (n√©e Dunn Gardner), estranged wife of George Townshend, 3rd Marquess Townshend. All the children of this union were declared illegitimate by a private Act of Parliament in 1843. Dunn Gardner, who had styled himself \\"Earl of Leicester\\" (the courtesy title used by the heir apparent to the marquessate of Townshend) before his election to parliament, then assumed his mother's maiden name of Dunn Gardner. He was Member of Parliament from 1841 to 1847, elected to represent Bodmin as a Conservative. He was also a Justice of the Peace, a Deputy Lieutenant, and High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1859. In 1872, John Dunn Gardner was the sixth largest landowner in the county of Cambridge, ranking immediately after the Earl of Hardwicke, the Duke of Bedford, John Walbanke Childers MP, the Duke of Rutland, and William Hall. He was the second largest landowner to be resident principally in Cambridgeshire, and owned , or about 0.7% of all land in that county.Kevin Cahill (2001). Who Owns Britain (and Ireland) Dunn Gardner died in January 1903, aged 91. Sarah, Marchioness Townshend Sarah and her husband married on 12 May 1807, and were known as Lord and Lady Chartley, a courtesy title from his grandfather, the 1st Marquess Townshend. In September 1807, on the death of the 1st Marquess, the couple became the Earl and Countess of Leicester, also by courtesy. They separated a few months later, in May 1808, and she filed an ecclesiastical suit for annulment, alleging non- consummation, i.e. that the couple had never had sex. While the suit was still pending, Lady Leicester eloped with John Margetts, a brewer, and married him in a bigamous ceremony at Gretna Green in October 1809. Her first marriage was never dissolved, which became a legal problem for the succession of the Townshend peerage. In 1811 her legal husband became the 3rd Marquess Townshend, but after leaving him, she did not use his name for over a decade, calling herself Mrs. Margetts; and Margetts gave his name to their children. Sarah survived both men: Margetts died in 1842, and Marquess Townshend died abroad in December 1855. She remarried a few weeks after her legal widowhood, to James Laidler on 10 January 1856, and died on 11 September 1858. Settling of the grandfather's estate in 1831 Chatteris House In August 1831, her father William Dunn-Gardner, formerly Dunn, Esq., of Chatteris House (died 10 November 1831) devised (bequeathed) the estate of Soham Mere, bought with the funds originally settled on his daughter and her husband, to his eldest natural grandson John Dunn Gardner, described in 1863 as a stranger in blood under the law.Attorney General vs Gardner, 1863 Hilary Term in The Exchequer Reports: Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Courts of Exchequer & Exchequer Chamber edited by Edwin Tyrrell Hurlstone and Francis Joseph Coltman, and published 1863. However, at the time (1831), John Dunn Gardner was his legitimate grandson, as the son born to his daughter within wedlock (albeit not by her husband). William Dunn-Gardner apparently devised the estate by name to ensure that his grandson would not be disinherited by any future legal steps taken by the Townshend family, which in fact happened in 1842. Soham Mere was given to the second brother William Dunn-Gardner, of Fordham Abbey, and descended in the family until 1974 when it was sold to the present owner. Formal bastardization in 1843 Sarah, Lady Townshend, and John Margetts had several children who bore their father's name until 26 December 1823, when there was a wholesale christening under the Townshend name, but they were all declared illegitimate by a private Act of Parliament brought in 1842 and passed the next year.Private Act (Not Printed), 6 & 7 Victoria I, c. 35 (12 July 1843), An Act to declare that certain Persons therein mentioned are not Children of the Most Honourable George Ferrars Marquis Townshend.

July 1811), born and known as John Margetts and so enrolled in school although styling himself Earl of Leicester, but christened December 1823 (with his other siblings) with the surname of Townshends, and then assumed the style of Earl of Leicester until 1843. 3\\\\. William Dunn-Gardner, of Fordham Abbey, nr Newmarket, co. Cambridge, JP (23 June 1812 ‚Äì 1879), known as Lord William Townshend from 26 December 1823 until 1843 (as the alleged second surviving son of the 3rd Marquess Townshend), when he and his siblings were declared illegitimate by private act. He inherited the Fordham Abbey estate from his maternal grandfather, but came into possession only in 1839 when his maternal grandmother died, and was at first an unpopular landlord.A.F. Wareham and A.P.M Wright (2002). Ibid. He married Angelina Wainwright (d. 1923), by whom he had one surviving son and heir Cyril. 3.1. Cyril Dunn-Gardner, of Fordham Abbey (d. 1911).\\"Fordham Abbey is the seat of Cyril Dunn-Gardner esq.\\". He is possibly the same as Captain Francis Cyril Dunn-Gardner or Captain F.C. Dunn Gardner, who was commissioned into the army in 1891, promoted to Lieutenant in 1893, served in the Boer War, and disappeared from Army Lists by 1901, with the note \\"Removed from Army\\". Cyril was of age in 1895, and owned about in Fordham in 1910. He died without issue in 1911, leaving a life interest in the Abbey estate to his mother and former guardian, who died 1923, as above. The Fordham Abbey estate then passed in 1923 to Algernon Charles Wyndham Dunn Gardner (d. 1929), apparently by then the next heir male. (The estate fell to about by his death). 4\\\\. Rosa-Jane Dunn-Gardner (born 2 January 1814, or June 1815 per Townshend Peerage Case), used the name of Lady Rosa Jane Townshend December 1823 - 1843, wife of Charles Mottram by 1842. 5\\\\. Frederick Thomas Margetts (born 3 July 1816) who died in infancy according to the Townshend Peerage Case. 5\\\\. Lavinia-Charlotte-Sarah Dunn-Gardner (b. 5 June 1820), known as Lady Lavinia Charlotte Sarah Townshend from December 1823 to 1843. 6\\\\. Cecil Mina Bolivar Dunn-Gardner (born 1825, d.1903),Date of birth listed as 1825 in the Townshend Peerage Case. However, his date of birth was listed as 1827 in the accessions list of the National Archives. His library was partly sold in June 1880; such sales often took place after the death of the collector in question. However Janus says he died 1903 formerly of the 13th light Dragoons, known as Lord Cecil Townshend from birth to age 21 (a second private act forbidding him to use that name and style was then passed). His death is recorded, 7 September 1903. This Cecil Dunn-Gardner was the father of two sons, Robert Cecil,born 18 Sep. 1868, Francis Cyril, bapt. 2 Aug. 1872 (both unmarried)and four daughters - (Lucy) Cecilia or Cissie, Maude, Violet, and Flora: 6.1. Robert Cecil Dunn-Gardner (b. 18 Sep 1868) unmarried 6.2. Francis Cyril Dunn-Gardner (bapt. 2 August 1872) 6.3. (Lucy) Cecilia Dunn-Gardner, or Cissie (d. 24 November 1931), who married 1stly in 1887 Col. Robert Ashton (1848‚Äì1898) by whom she had one son and one daughter, and 2ndly in 1899 the 10th Earl of Scarbrough (16 November 1857 ‚Äì 4 March 1945), by whom she had an only daughter. According to her daughter's obituary (2000), the Countess ignored her daughters, and was known for her vulgarity, solecisms, and malapropisms. 6.4. Violet Dunn Gardner, the artist. 6.5. Maude Dunn Gardner, aged 15 in 1881 (born circa 1865) 6.6. Flora Dunn Gardner, who had issue.Her son Robin wrote the first account of his great-grandmother Sarah's life. Robin was a close friend of his first cousin Dorothy Wellesley; both were poets, but he was also homosexual while she was bisexual. See blurb for Campion's book. Marriages and children Dunn Gardner married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1847, was Mary Lawson (d. 13 April 1851), elder daughter of Andrew Lawson, of Boro Bridge, Boroughbridge, co York formerly MP for Knaresborough, and granddaughter maternally of the late Sir Thomas Gooch, Bt., of Benacre, co. Suffolk. By her, he had issue, one son and one daughter.Ruvigny. The Plantagenet Roll: The Anne of Exeter Volume, p.555 and Burke's Landed Gentry 1862, p. 531. His second wife, whom he married in 1853, was Ada Piggott, daughter of William Pigott, Esq., of Dullingham House, Newmarket, co Cambridge, and granddaughter of Sir George Pigott, Bt., of Knapton, Queen's County. By his second wife, he had further issue, a second son and a second daughter. Children: # (by 1st wife) Arthur Andrew Cecil Dunn-Gardner, J.P. (8 January 1851‚Äì28 July 1902), who was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, and was called to the Bar. His obituary states that he ¬¥devoted his life to the interest of others¬¥, and he was involved with the Society for the Relief of Distress and the Charity Organization Society. He was apparently also a notable book collector like his father.: A Calendar of the Names of Over 17,000 Men and Women by William Carew Hazlitt (published 1971) lists Cecil (1897), his father John Dunn-Gardner (1854), and a Cyril Dunn-Gardner, apparently son of William Dunn-Gardner, of Fordham Abbey. He married 1890 Rose Lawrie, daughter of Andrew Lawrie.Ruvigny. The Plantagenet Roll: The Anne of Exeter Volume, p.555 She was apparently the Rose Dunn-Gardner, who was active in 1895 in the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity (formed 1869), known later as Charity Organisation Society (COS).Robert Whelan, based on research by Barendina Smedley. \\"Helping the Poor: Friendly visiting, dole charities and dole queues\\", Civitas: Institute for the Study of Civil Society, London, first published October 2001.

Rose Dunn-Gardner was an advocate for formal training, and published a paper that year, which led to the formation of a Committee on Training, which eventually gave rise by 1903 to a de facto school of social work, now part of the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics. Rose herself disliked the growing professionalization of social work, and resigned in protest over a paid appointment some years later. # (by 1st wife) Mary Marianne Mariana, later Mrs William Robinson (b. 1848‚Äì1850) md 1870 her stepmother's brother (Christopher) William Robinson (23 January 1830 ‚Äì 23 June 1889),(Christopher) William Robinson of Dullingham House, Newmarket, co Cambridge (the house formerly owned or rented by her stepmother's father) and Denston Hall, co. Suffolk; he was son of William Pigott, Esq., of Dullingham House, Newmarket, co Cambridge (see above) by his wife Harriet Jeaffreson. He changed his name twice from Pigott to Jeaffreson to inherit Dullingham House under the terms of his grandfather's will, and then again to Robinson to inherit Denston Hall, Suffolk, from another relative. He died 23 June 1889, apparently leaving no issue.Ruvigny. Ibid.

Like many of her class, she was not originally named, and only referenced by her hull designation. Later she was named for Alameda County, California, the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction LST-32 was laid down on 17 February 1943, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 22 May 1943; sponsored by Miss Dorothy M. Manko; and commissioned on 12 July 1943, with Lieutenant Gardnar P. Mulloy, USNR, in command. Service history After commissioning, LST-32 served as a training platform in Chesapeake Bay, until March 1944, when she crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the Mediterranean Sea. On 1 April, while proceeding in a convoy from the Algerian coast to the island of Majorca, she and her consorts endured a low level attack by a formation of three German twin-engine bombers. Antiaircraft fire splashed one of them and drove off the other two. The ship operated into the summer with the task group that resupplied the Anzio beachhead. Early in August, she prepared for the invasion of southern France, and, during the landings on 15 August, was among the LSTs off the √éles d'Hy√®res as senior radar ship. She sent two separate radar units ashore on Port Cros, one on 15 August, and the second on the following day. LST-32 spent the next 10 months carrying supplies and munitions between various ports in the Mediterranean. In January 1945, she lifted British troops to Greece to help suppress a communist attempt to take over the government. On the return trip, the vessel rescued about 100 survivors from the Greek ship SS Ionia wrecked in a storm. She later transported prisoners, elements of the French Foreign Legion, railroad cars, and other vehicles between ports in Italy, France, and North Africa, before returning to the United States at New York, in July 1945. The ship then moved to Norfolk, to undergo repairs and alterations preparatory to her transfer to the war in the Pacific. However, the Japanese capitulation in mid-August caused both alterations and reassignment to be cancelled. Instead, LST-32 remained in the Atlantic Fleet until July 1946, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida. Post-war service Reactivated as a part of the Navy's expansion of its active fleet following the communist invasion of South Korea, the ship was recommissioned on 7 March 1951, with Lieutenant John W. Leonard, in command and operated with the Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Force until reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet Naval Air Force in April 1953. By September, she was operating out of Naples, Italy, serving as an advanced base support ship with Air Logistics Support Division 2. With the exception of occasional voyages to the United States for alterations and repairs, LST-32 operated in the Mediterranean Sea for the remainder of her active Navy career providing the 6th Fleet with the capability of establishing forward NATO air bases anywhere in the Mediterranean on short notice. On 1 July 1955, she received the name Alameda County. Most of her missions consisted of training evolutions and exercises, but once she had the opportunity to put all that practice to use. Late in October 1956, Israel, Britain, and France retaliated against Egypt after the latter country had seized the Suez Canal. In response to the crisis, Alameda County moved to Suda Bay, Crete, and had an emergency air base in operation by 22 November. From then until 4 December, she staged United Nations forces into the troubled area while evacuating Americans and other foreign nationals. Soon thereafter, she resumed normal operations out of Naples. On 28 September 1957, the ship was redesignated Advance Aviation Base Ship AVB-1. In July 1958, Alameda County again demonstrated her capabilities when United States Marine Corps forces landed in Lebanon, to help stabilize the volatile situation in that country. She returned to Suda Bay, on 14 July, and spent the next three months housing, feeding, rearming, and refuelling the air squadrons flying support missions for the marines in Beirut. The landing force departed Lebanon in October, and Alameda County resumed her drills and exercises put of Naples. On 25 June 1962, Alameda County was decommissioned at Naples; and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 June 1962. She was sold to the government of Italy on 20 November 1962. She served the Italian Navy as Anteo (A 5306) into the mid-1980s. Her final fate is unknown. Awards LST-32 earned two battle stars for her World War II service.

Her principal subject of research has been the history of early Jewish mysticism. Academic career Elior is the John and Golda Cohen Professor of Jewish Philosophy and Jewish Mystical Thought at the Hebrew University, where she has taught since 1978. Currently she is the head of the Department of Jewish Thought. She earned her PhD Summa cum laude in 1976. Her specialties are early Jewish Mysticism, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Hekhalot literature, Messianism, Sabbatianism, Hasidism, Chabad, Frankism and the role of women in Jewish culture. She has been a visiting professor at Princeton University, UCL, Yeshiva University, the University of Tokyo, Doshisha University in Kyoto, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, in the University of Chicago and at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Elior claims that the Essenes, the supposed authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls never existed. She contends (as have Lawrence Schiffman, Moshe Goshen-Gottstein, Chaim Menachem Rabin, and others) that the Essenes were really the renegade sons of Zadok, a priestly caste banished from the Temple of Jerusalem by Greek rulers in the 2nd century BC. She conjectures that the scrolls were taken with them when they were banished. \\"In Qumran, the remnants of a huge library were found,\\" Elior says, with some of the early Hebrew texts dating back to the 2nd century BC. Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the earliest known complete version of the Old Testament dated back to the 9th century AD. \\"The scrolls attest to a biblical priestly heritage,\\" says Elior, who speculates that the scrolls were hidden in Qumran for safekeeping. She is a member of the board of the international council of the New Israel Fund. Awards and recognition In 2006, Elior received the Gershom Scholem Prize for Research in Kabbalah from the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Criticism and controversy On her primary field of expertise, Hasidism, Yohanan Petrovsky- Shtern, Professor at Northwestern, states \\"Elior uses a rather outdated concept of the [hasidic] movement to cement her narrative. She leaves aside theories, ideas, insights, and data amassed by scholars who have long departed from the thinking patterns of Dinur or Scholem.\\" And that Elior, among others, \\"should revisit [the early writers of hasidic stories'] conceptual framework, in which sources coexist in a nontemporal fashion and freely talk to one another, as ideas in the Platonic world of forms.\\" Dead Sea Scrolls Her theory of the origins of mysticism in the priestly class has been challenged by Prof. Yehuda Liebes of the Hebrew University, and her understanding of the ancient calendar was rejected by Sacha Stern. Eibert Tigchelaar noted that her examples have a \\"lack of historical specificity that are disturbing and frustrating.\\" She has been defended by Joseph Dan. Princeton professor Peter Schaefer says she blurs distinctions between texts and periods, and is not sensitive to important nuances. He also notes that her views of angels at Qumran and the calendar are wrong. Prof Martha Himmelfarb finds Elior's work \\"simply untenable\\". Himmelfarb says that Elior creates tenuous links, historical connections without a basis, and sees things that just are \\"not there.\\" Elior claims that the Essenes, the supposed authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls never existed. She contends (as have Lawrence Schiffman, Moshe Goshen- Gottstein, Chaim Menachem Rabin, and others) that the Essenes were really the renegade sons of Zadok, a priestly caste banished from the Temple of Jerusalem by Greek rulers in 2nd century BC. She conjectures that the scrolls were taken with them when they were banished. \\"In Qumran, the remnants of a huge library were found,\\" Elior says, with some of the early Hebrew texts dating back to the 2nd century BC. Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the earliest known version of the Old Testament dated back to the 9th century AD. \\"The scrolls attest to a biblical priestly heritage,\\" says Elior, who speculates that the scrolls were hidden in Qumran for safekeeping. James Charlesworth, director of the Dead Sea Scrolls Project and professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, said there is \\"significant evidence for the Essenes‚Äô existence\\" and \\"It is impossible that Josephus created a group already mentioned by Philo, who had visited Jerusalem.\\" Princeton religion professor Martha Himmelfarb said she doesn‚Äôt think Elior‚Äôs work is as \\"historically informed\\" as other research on the Scrolls, saying, \\"[Elior] does not tend to engage the historical nitty-gritty that other scholars‚Äô work does.\\" \\\\-->  See also  * Ada Rapoport-Albert * Moshe Idel ReferencesBibliography * Israel Ba'al Shem Tov and his Contemporaries, Kabbalists, Sabbatians, Hasidim and Mithnagdim, Jerusalem : Carmel Publication House 2014 * Memory and Oblivion: The Secret of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Van Leer Institute and Hakibutz haMeuchad, 2009 * The Dybbuk and Jewish Women, Jerusalem and New York, Urim Publications, 2008 * * * Heikhalot Literature and Merkavah Tradition Ancient Jewish Mysticism and its Sources, Tel Aviv: Yediot Ahronot; Sifrei Hemed: 2004 (Hebrew) * * Herut al Haluhot ‚Äì Studies in the Mystical Foundations of Hasidism, Tel Aviv: Broad Cast University: Defense Ministry Press 1999. * Paneiah ha-Shonot shel ha-Herut -Iyunim be-Mistika Yehudit (Alpayim 15, Am Oved 1998) * * Torat HaElohut BaDor haSheni shel Hasidut Habad, Jerusalem: Hebrew University: Magnes Press 1982 (Hebrew) * Heikhalot Zutarti: An Early Mystical Manuscript of the Mishnaic Talmudic Period, Jerusalem: Hebrew University: Magnes Press 1982 (Hebrew) * Galia Raza: 16th Century Kabbalistic Manuscript, Jerusalem: Hebrew University 1981 (Hebrew) * Yehudah Liebes, \\"Children of the sun vs. children of the moon\\" Haaretz 4/6/2003 * Sacha Stern, \\"Rachel Elior on Ancient Jewish Calendars: A Critique\\" Aleph: Historical Studies in Science and Judaism - Volume 5, 2005, pp. 287‚Äì292 * Peter Schaffer, Critical edition of Heikhalot Zutarti, Tarbiz 54 (1985)Hebrew, critical review of her work * David Tamar, Critical review of her edition of Galia Razia Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 2 Hebrew (1983) External links * Facebook page * Prof. Elior's homepage at the Hebrew University * Dead Sea Scrolls‚Äô origins spark debate * Category:Israeli academics Category:Israeli Jews Category:Jewish mysticism Category:Kabbalah Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:Philosophers of Judaism Category:Historians of Jews and Judaism Category:Jewish historians ","title":"Rachel Elior"},{"id":"10425279","text":"In clothing, heather refers to interwoven yarns of mixed colors, and possibly the type of fiber, producing another color. It is typically used to mix multiple shades of grey or grey with another color to produce a muted shade (e.g., heather green), but any two colors can be mixed, including bright colors. Heather yarn is more expensive than other yarn. A mixed fabric color is achieved by using different colors of fiber and mixing them together (a good example is a grey heather t-shirt). Black and white fiber mixed will combine to give grey heather fiber. Heather is blended fibers combined to create a multicolored effect. Heather fabric typically contains three fibers: cotton, polyester or rayon. Heather grey fabric is never 100% Cotton. Another fiber must always be added with the cotton in order to achieve the necessary color. It is important to note that depending on the percent of cotton, the fabric can still be legally labeled 100% cotton.

Many species were formerly classified, along with other genera since segregated elsewhere, in a more inclusive genus Hedyotis. Bluets are often small and delicate. For example, H. rosea may grow only one inch tall. Some species are single stemmed and others have multiple stems in bunches. Flowers are blue, purple, lavender, white, or rose, often with shades of one color present in an individual population. Flowers have 4 sepals, colloquially denominated \\"petals\\", a salverform corolla with 4 lobes, and an inferior ovary. Some species exhibit heterostyly. The fruit is an often roughly cordate capsule enclosing many seeds and which usually dehisces via a suture across its apex. Houstonia consists of 20 species native to North America. Another 5 species are classified in the genus Stenaria; Houstonia without Stenaria is paraphyletic. Close relatives of the genus are Oldenlandia microtheca and, more distantly, Arcytophyllum.

The name in Valencian is Adem√∫s, but the local language is Spanish, not Valencian. History The many archaeological remains still present from different time periods‚ÄîNeolithic, Iberian, Roman‚Äîreveal an early occupation of the area. Notwithstanding, the first written references are Arabic ones, focusing on its castle, whose advantageous emplacement dominated the Turia river and its natural passage from the lands of Aragon to the city of Valencia. The Muslim fortress of Al-DƒÅm≈´s was conquered by Peter II of Aragon in 1210, with the aid of the hospitalier and templar knights, who were rewarded with the right to collect some taxes from the area. It fell back into Muslim hands shortly thereafter. It was finally incorporated into the kingdom of Valencia by James I of Aragon, who put it under direct control of the crown, together with the other historical village of the comarca, Castielfabib. As a royal villa, Ademuz periodically sent an elected representative to the Corts Valencianes. As a frontier fortress, it suffered from the wars with Castille in the 14th century: both Ademuz and Castielfabib were invaded and occupied by Peter I of Castile. The heroic defense and the loyalty of its population were later rewarded by Peter IV of Arag√≥n and his immediate successors, who gave the villa new rights and privileges. From the beginnings of the 14th century onwards, Ademuz and its countryside were also an Encomienda of the Order of Montesa, which anyway never ruled over Ademuz, limiting itself to collect some taxes they had rights over. On June 7, 1656, the villa suffered a massive earthquake which destroyed the primitive church of San Pedro Intramuros, the city council and forty other houses; the ramparts and the towers of the castle, which had been built surrounding the top of the mountain were also destroyed. Notwithstanding, Ademuz's castle will still prove its worth during the many civil wars of the 19th century, with it being occupied and (supposedly) rebuilt several times by carlist troops. The two original municipalities which existed in the Rinc√≥n's comarca, Castielfabib and Ademuz, became fragmented over time, affecting specially that of Ademuz, from which several villages seceded as they reached some populational and economical importance: Vallanca (17th century), Puebla de San Miguel (18th century), Casas Altas y Casas Bajas (both during the 19th century). Geography Ademuz is situated in the middle of the Rinc√≥n de Ademuz, a Spanish comarca belonging to Valencian Community representing an exclave situated between the territories of the provinces of Cuenca (Castile-La Mancha) and Teruel (Aragon). The town counts three pedan√≠as (civil parishes): Mas del Olmo, Segsa and Val de la Sabina. Demography As of the 2008 census of INE, the population of Ademuz was 1,269.Source: INE - Demographics of Spanish municipalities since 1842 and since 1996 ImageSize = width:450 height:220 PlotArea = left:70 right:40 top:20 bottom:20 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify Colors = id:gray1 value:gray(0.9) DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:0 till:5000 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5000 start:0 gridcolor:gray1 PlotData = bar:1842 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:3033 width:15 text:3033 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1877 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:3339 width:15 text:3339 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1900 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:3415 width:15 text:3415 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1920 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:4092 width:15 text:4092 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1940 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:3866 width:15 text:3866 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1960 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:2827 width:15 text:2827 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1981 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1545 width:15 text:1545 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2001 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1115 width:15 text:1115 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2005 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1157 width:15 text:1157 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2008 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1269 width:15 text:1269 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2009 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1286 width:15 text:1286 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2011 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1250 width:15 text:1250 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2019 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:1042 width:15 text:1042 textcolor:red fontsize:8px Gallery File:Verge de l'Horta -Adem√∫s-.JPGChurch of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Huerta, 14th century File:Castell d'Ademuz.jpgAdemuz castle File:Casa de la Villa- Ademuz.JPGTown hall ReferencesLiterature *Candel Tortajada, F.: Viaje al Rinc√≥n de Ademuz.

Born at Campagna,F. Gibbone, La vita del Santo Abate Antonino, 1885 he left his native town to become a monk at Monte Cassino. During that time, Italy was suffering from barbarian invasions and Antoninus was forced to leave this monastery. Monte Cassino had been plundered by the Lombards and the monks escaped to Rome to seek protection from Pope Pelagius II. Antoninus, however, headed for Campania where he ended up at Castellammare di Stabia. Here Saint Catellus (San Catello) was bishop. Catellus, wishing to become a hermit, gave up his office as bishop and entrusted Antoninus with the task of serving as the town's bishop. Catellus withdrew to Monte Aureo. The desire to remain a hermit himself led Antoninus to convince Catellus to return to his see. Antoninus retired to Monte Aureo himself and lived in a natural grotto. However, Catellus again decided to withdraw to this mountain and dedicate himself only sporadically to the cares of his diocese. An apparition of Saint Michael is said to have convinced the two to construct the stone church now known as Monte San Angelo or Punta San Michele. Subsequently, Catellus was accused of witchcraft by a priest named Tibeius (Tibeio) of Stabia and was held captive at Rome until a new pope released him. Catellus returned to Stabia and dedicated himself to expanding the church that he had helped found. Inhabitants of Sorrento, meanwhile, convinced Antoninus to settle at Sorrento. Antoninus became an abbot of the Benedictine monastery of San Agrippino, succeeding Boniface (Bonifacio) in this capacity. Veneration A miracle attributed to Saint Antoninus states that he saved a young child from a whale after it had been swallowed up by this sea creature. The sorrentini erected a crypt and basilica in honor of Antoninus. He was credited with saving the city from many dangers: a Moorish naval invasion; the revolt of the Sorrento leader Giovanni Grillo against Spanish domination; demonic possession; bubonic plague; and cholera.

The mine involved is usually of a high-value commodity such as gold, silver or diamonds. Often there is a map (sometimes called a \\"waybill\\") purportedly showing the location of the mine. Common reasons given for the mines being lost include: * The mine is discovered and worked by a recluse who refuses to divulge the location, and dies without revealing the location. * The mine is worked by native peoples who refuse to divulge the location to others. * The mineral deposit is discovered in a remote location, and upon returning to the area the discoverer cannot find it again. * The discoverer dies of hunger, thirst, or exposure shortly after discovering the deposit, and his body is found with rich ore specimens in his possession. * The discoverers are killed by hostile natives. Sometimes the natives cover up the entrance to the mine. * In Spanish Empire colonies in the New World, many lost mines were supposedly worked under the direction of Jesuit priests before their sudden expulsion in 1767. Some lost mine legends have a historical basis; some have none. But the lure of lost mine legends is attested by the many books on the subject, and the popularity of publications such as Lost Treasure magazine.

The company was established in 1994, and is now owned by Frasers Property. History Malmaison Edinburgh was the first hotel in the chain to open Malmaison was founded by Scottish hotelier Ken McCulloch in 1994 in collaboration with hotel group Arcadian International. The first hotel opened in Leith, Edinburgh, with a second opening in Glasgow a month later. The chain is named after the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison on the outskirts of Paris, which inspired the design and style found within its hotels. Malmaison owner MWB Group went into administration in November 2012. US private equity firm KSL Capital Partners purchased Malmaison for an estimated ¬£180 million in March 2013. Under KSL ownership a hotel was opened in Dundee. In May 2014, Malmaison stopped serving foie gras in their hotel restaurants after a campaign by animal rights group PETA. In January 2015, under guidance from investment bank UBS, KSL sought prospective buyers for Malmaison and the Hotel du Vin chain (HDV). Private equity firms, Terra Firma Capital Partners and TDR Capital, were identified by Sky News in March 2015 as being two of three bidders for the chain. Four months later in June 2015, the chain along with Hotel du Vin was sold to Frasers Hospitality of Frasers Property Group for ¬£363.4 million.

The chain has fifteen hotels, fourteen of which are converted historic buildings, including a prison, postal sorting office, a church and a building once used as a brothel. As of January 2017, Malmaison's only new-build hotel is located in Liverpool. Malmaison was subject of protests in February 2017 when wedding fairs at their London and Liverpool hotels were targeted by trade union Unite. The union accused the hotel chain of low pay, long hours, unfair tipping practices, health and safety breaches and alleged management bullying. In response Malmaison stated that ‚ÄúIt operates a fair, transparent policy regarding all aspects of remuneration. All employees, regardless of age requirements, are paid at least the National Living Wage. Additionally, it is the rule that 100% of the service charge received is paid out to food and beverage employees and any breach of this will be thoroughly investigated.‚Äù Operational locations= Aberdeen  Opened in 2008, Malmaison Aberdeen was formerly the category C listed Queen‚Äôs Hotel which was converted and extended at a cost of ¬£7 million under the direction of London-based Curious Architecture.

Early life Savoldi was born two months premature in Castano Primo (Italy). He spent his childhood in Castano Primo and Bergamo (Milan, Italy) and was raised by his grandmother and an aunt before finally joining his family in Three Oaks, Michigan at age twelve. Giuseppe Savoldi anglicized his first name to \\"Joe\\" and became an athlete in high school, excelling in football, basketball, baseball, and track. Football career=Notre Dame After graduation from Three Oaks High, he enrolled at the University of Notre Dame, where, beginning in 1928, he played football for the Fighting Irish teams coached by Knute Rockne. His first start for Notre Dame came during his sophomore year against would-be national champion, Georgia Tech, after Rockne's first, second, and third string fullbacks all fell to injuries. The following week, coach Rockne moved Savoldi from running back to the line, and Savoldi briefly quit the squad before being moved back to the running back position. The All-American fullback was first nicknamed, \\"Galloping Joe,\\" followed by \\"The Wandering Wop,\\" followed by \\"The People's Choice,\\" before finally earning the moniker \\"Jumping Joe.\\" The nickname that finally stuck, was a result of a play he made in a 1929 game against Carnegie Tech, when he scored a touchdown by diving up and over the goal line to win the game. Although commonplace now, diving over the line of scrimmage could be dangerous during a period of leather helmets and little, or no, shoulder padding. Other career highlights for Savoldi came on October 4, 1930, when he scored the first ever Notre Dame touchdown at the newly opened Notre Dame Stadium; and one week later, when he scored three touchdowns against Navy, sealing his fame as \\"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's $750,000.00 stadium.\\" Savoldi averaged 11 yards per carry and 40 yards per kick off return,Based on 1929-1930 game statistics provided by the Notre Dame athletic dept and due to his size (5'11\\" 218lbs) was known for his punishing style of running the ball. His career came to a sudden end on November 17, 1930 when he withdrew from school after divorce papers were filed, and news of his secret marriage was leaked to the press. Savoldi and his Notre Dame teammates were undefeated national champions during both the 1929 and 1930 seasons. NFL Upon Savoldi's expulsion from Notre Dame, he was first signed by Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers, but when local Chicago Bears fans heard the news, their harsh criticism of George Halas not signing Savoldi led to an elaborate double-cross of Lambeau. According to Halas, Lambeau had broken the newly created \\"Grange Rule\\" by signing Savoldi prior to his senior class having graduated. But as soon as Lambeau retracted Savoldi's contract, Halas signed Savoldi, and Jumping Joe joined the Bears. Lambeau and the Packers then protested with commissioner Carr, but the commissioner allowed the Bears to keep Savoldi as long as they were willing to pay a fine of $1,000 per game that Savoldi played in. The Bears started Savoldi at the halfback position opposite Red Grange, and in his first game (only ten days after leaving Notre Dame), he scored the only touchdown in a 6‚Äì0 victory over Ernie Nevers' Cardinals on Thanksgiving Day in Wrigley Field. After helping the Bears win their final three games of the season (including a 21‚Äì0 upset of Lambeau's Packers on December 7, 1930 at Wrigley Field), Savoldi was invited to re-join his fighting Irish team in a Notre Dame All-Star vs West/South All-Star game in the Los Angeles Coliseum. During the 20‚Äì7 victory, Savoldi scored three touchdowns. Professional wrestling career During the All-Star game, he caught the eye of two famous spectators‚Äîwrestling promoter Billy Sandow and former world champion Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis. Savoldi agreed to meet Lewis and Sandow the following day at a local gym, and after an informal tryout in which Strangler Lewis proclaimed Savoldi the strongest man he had ever wrestled, Sandow eventually signed Savoldi to a contract in May 1931. Savoldi's debut match took place in February 1931, wrestling under the management of Puss Halbritter, and before formalizing his contract with Sandow, he appeared in a final charity football game in Kezar Stadium with the Savoldi all-stars. As a wrestler, Savoldi became known for his finishing move, the flying dropkick (the pro wrestling move known today as simply the \\"dropkick\\"). From the early 1930s through the end of his career in 1950, Savoldi was credited as having originated the move but today that attribution is disputed between him and Abe Coleman. Interpromotional wars were raging at the time, and on April 7, 1933 at Chicago Stadium, Savoldi was involved in a double cross on heavyweight champion Jim Londos. After a tangle by the ropes, referee Bob Managoff declared Savoldi the winner by pinfall and awarded him the title. Vigorous arguments were waged over whether Savoldi had truly won the match, and whether Londos' title had even been on the line. As a result, Savoldi and Managoff were suspended in some territories and the title change was not universally recognized. Londos continued to bill himself as world champion, while Savoldi went to the New York area claiming the same, until he was defeated by Jim Browning on June 12 at Yankee Stadium. After peace was made between rival promotions, a Londos/Savoldi rematch was held at Chicago Stadium on January 31, 1934. Londos won the contest. Savoldi continued his wrestling career throughout the decade, touring New Zealand in 1936, appearing in Hawaii and Australia in 1937, and spending a lengthy time in Europe shortly before World War II. World War II Savoldi was approached by the U.S. government in 1942 about joining the war effort in an espionage role. He was chosen due to his fluency in multiple dialects of Italian, his expertise in hand-to-hand combat, and his deep knowledge of the Italian geography‚Äîincluding the interior of Benito Mussolini's compound. Burke, Michael. Outrageous Good Fortune, page 94. \\"Savoldi was brought in from a training site. He was built like a gorilla but moved as lightly as a leopard. He would terrify Girosi and maybe the entire Italian fleet.\\" Savoldi was assigned to the Special Operations branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), with the code name \\"Sampson\\". He took part in missions in North Africa, Italy, and France during 1943‚Äì1945. As a member the 2677th Regiment APO 512, Savoldi took part in multiple missions behind enemy lines. His service in Special Operations included at least three successful, high-visibility missions, all within the McGregor Project under the assumed identity of Giuseppe DeLeo. The real Giuseppe DeLeo was a captain in the Italian Army who had been captured in North Africa. The McGregor Project used Savoldi and other Italian and Italian-American contacts to expedite the Italian surrender to the Allies in 1943. Savoldi's first operation (July‚ÄìDecember 1943) was with Lt. Mike Burke, Lt. John Ringling North, and Peter Tompkins. Their mission was to escort Italian-American film producer Marcello Girosi (whose brother Massimo was commander of the Italian Navy) around the Mediterranean theater. Savoldi may have provided security for OSS chief \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan, when he met with General George S. Patton in Palermo on 10 July 1943. Savoldi's second operation as part of the ongoing McGregor Project was to extract Italian scientist Carlo Calosi from the German-occupied part of Italy. Calosi was the inventor of the highly effective magnetic trigger used in the Silvrifici Italiano Calosi (SIC) torpedo, which the Germans used extensively. Savoldi and colleagues Donald Downes and Andre Pacatte located Calosi in Rome. They moved him, his commander Admiral Minisini, their wives, several technicians, and secret documents on the SIC to the Amalfi Coast, where they were picked up by US forces. Calosi's party went to the US and developed countermeasures against the SIC for the Allies. During his third major mission, Savoldi worked undercover in Naples, where he infiltrated the local Camorra and helped break up one of the largest black market operations in all of Italy. While undercover, Savoldi again assumed the identity of Giuseppe De Leo, but he worked in civilian clothing, posing as a rogue operator. Savoldi spoke Italian in several dialects as well as French, Spanish, and some German, and his dangerous work behind enemy lines was highly regarded according to several, now declassified, documents. The 1946 book Cloak and Dagger by Alastair MacBain and Corey Ford includes an entire chapter titled \\"The Saga of Jumping Joe\\", recounting Savoldi's participation in the McGregor Project.References to Savoldi's missions are also covered in The OSS in Italy by Max Corvo.Brown, Anthony Cave. Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero The book was later adapted to film under the same title, Cloak and Dagger starring Gary Cooper. Savoldi's friend, former OSS agent, E. Michael Burke acted as technical advisor. A 1950 NBC radio show of the same title based on Ford and MacBain's book lasted 26 episodes. Retirement Savoldi resumed his wrestling career before war's end, but his ability to move around in the ring would begin to diminish due to the onset of arthritis. He tried promoting in the Chicago area for a while between 1946 and 1948, and is credited with nicknaming and training the first African-American pro wrestling champion Bobo Brazil. Savoldi returned to the ring for a couple more years, wrestling his final match in 1950. He then went back to university to work towards earning his qualifications for a teacher's degree, and eventually started a program to mentor hard-to-reach kids before becoming a full-time science teacher at Henderson County High School in Henderson, Kentucky. Savoldi died in 1974 at the age of 65, and is buried in Henderson. Other media In October 1931, Savoldi signed a motion picture contract with Hollywood and committed to appear in football and wrestling pictures. In 1941, he brought a new energy drink to market, called Dropkick, The Drink For \\"All Americans\\". Despite excellent pre-sales, including a contract with the University of Notre Dame to feature the drink in their stadium during the 1942 season, the business venture fizzled when the United States entered the war, and the ensuing sugar rationing eliminated his ability to mass-produce the drink.

Jarrett was given a contract and in April 1972 went into the studio to record Expectations.

His best known extant building is Sokol (Falcon) luxury Art Nouveau apartment building in Kuznetsky Most Street, Moscow. A prolific architect, Mashkov built mostly eclectic buildings with Russian Revival features. Biography=Education and early career Ivan Mikhailovich Sokolov (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ï–≤–¥–æ–∫–∏–º–æ–≤), son of a village blacksmith, lost both his parents in early childhood. He was adopted by Pavel Karpovich Mashkov, a Lipetsk businessman, and his wife, Natalya Yefimovna (n√©e Andreyeva), thus acquiring the name of Mashkov. Natalya's brother, Alexey Yefimovich Andreev, was a town architect in Lipetsk. In 1881, Ivan was admitted to Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He graduated Alexander Kaminsky class of architecture with an honorary medal and a construction license in 1886 at the age of 19 ‚Äì an exceptionally quick education by any standard (normally, it would take 10 to 15 years from admissions to professional license). In 1885‚Äì1888, Mashkov assisted Konstantin Bykovsky on Devichye Pole campus planning and August Weber on the completion of Polytechnical Museum in Moscow. In 1889‚Äì1890 he visited Lipetsk and completed there two schools, a hospital and a prison chapel ‚Äì at the age of 23. Back in Moscow, Mashkov completed over a dozen buildings still in his twenties, and his masterpiece ‚Äì the Sokol ‚Äì at the age of 36. Sokol Building Sokol Building, 2007 photo Sokol Building, detail, 2007 photo Mashkov's Sokol (Falcon) building is unique not only for his career, but to Moscow Art Nouveau in general. It is the only building in the city designed in original Vienna Secession style (see Illarion Ivanov-Schitz for a modified version of Secession). Its gilded roof and abundant forged iron ornaments looked like a citation from Otto Wagner (these ornaments were eventually lost). At the same time, the building is definitely Muscovite; the shape of its frieze repeats the lines of nearby Hotel Metropol. The majolica mosaic of a falcon flying over a stormy sea was made by Nikolay Sapunov (of Mir Iskusstva art group). The subject of this picture itself is a double citation ‚Äì from Maxim Gorky's Song of a falcon (1899) and from nearby Moscow Art Theater's Seagull symbol (1903). However, the building has nothing to do with these symbols or with Mashkov's natural name ‚Äì it was named after M.V. Sokol, the owner. Neoclassical revival Mashkov's work prior to Sokol belongs to traditional muscovite eclectics and moderate Russian Revival of 1880s-1890s, and does not stand out among hundreds of similar buildings of this period. An unusually large share of his work was built for public charities, which ruled out expensive decorations and interiors. The only decoration he allowed was Abramtsevo majolica. After the Russian Revolution of 1905, the public lost the interest in Art Nouveau; architects responded with a revival of Neoclassicism. Mashkov completed two private buildings (Tverskoy Pawn Shop and Eggert Apartments) in a stern, Saint Petersburg version of this style. In 1912-1913, he built his last major project - psychiatric hospital in Poteshnaya Street (now, Gannushkin Hospital). These buildings didn't make architectural landmarks; Mashkov, however, did make a lasting statement with his iconic monument to Ivan Fydorov (sculpture by Sergei Volnukhin). Preservation and public activities Like many contemporary architects, Mashkov was keen on studying and preserving historical national architecture, and in 1898 joined the Moscow Archaeological Society. He surveyed many historical churches and monasteries in Moscow, Dmitrov, Borovsk etc., published his own studies and edited the journal of Society. Mashkov supervised restoration of Kremlin cathedrals, Sukharev Tower, St. Basil Cathedral and other memorial buildings. In 1908-1918, he also co-chaired Moscow Architectural Society and contributed to the construction of House of Architects (17, Yermolayevsky Lane, currently Museum of Modern Art). In 1908-1933, he managed the Architectural Department of Polytechnical Museum, the forerunner of present-day Museum of Architecture. He is credited with editing the best guide to architecture of Moscow (1913). Despite his reputation as preservationist and archaeologist, Mashkov joined the emerging skyscraper movement in 1913, and proposed a 13-story highrise on Tverskaya Street. The City Hall blocked this proposal and banned further highrise construction in the center of Moscow. Soviet period At the time of Russian Revolution of 1917, Mashkov was employed by the City of Moscow as deputy to City Architect. Bolshevik administration retained him in his office, and for some time Mashkov acted as the City Architect, engaged mostly in maintenance of the city in the middle of a civil war. In 1929, Mashkov and sculptor Nikolay Andreyev erected the neoclassical monument to Aleksandr Ostrovsky near Maly Theater. Mashkov continued surveying memorial buildings (some of them already scheduled for demolition) and headed the restoration of Pashkov House (then known as Rumyantsev Museum, later Lenin Library and Russian State Library). He took no part in architectural disputes of 1920s, but was present in professional journals and wrote college textbooks (1935). In 1934, Mashkov became a professor in Moscow Architectural Institute; since 1935 he chaired the department of architecture of Moscow Construction Institute. In 1937, he was awarded the title of Hero of Labor (1927 statute, predecessor of 1938 Hero of Socialist Labor title). Mashkov remained well established in Soviet academic circles until his death and was buried with honors at Novodevichy Cemetery; his book on Novodevichy Convent was reissued posthumously in 1949.

Isaac Titsingh seated on the far left of the picture (wearing a hat) and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest seated to his right. Isaac Titsingh FRS ( January 1745 in Amsterdam ‚Äì 2 February 1812 in Paris) was a Dutch scholar, merchant-trader and ambassador.Nussbaum, Louis- Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Isaak Titsingh\\" in . During a long career in East Asia, Titsingh was a senior official of the Dutch East India Company (). He represented the European trading company in exclusive official contact with Tokugawa Japan, traveling to Edo twice for audiences with the shogun and other high bakufu officials. He was the Dutch and VOC governor general in Chinsura, Bengal. Titsingh worked with his counterpart, Charles Cornwallis, who was governor general of the British East India Company. In 1795, Titsingh represented Dutch and VOC interests in China, where his reception at the court of the Qing Qianlong Emperor stood in stark contrast to the rebuff suffered by Britain's ambassador George Macartney's mission in 1793, just prior to celebrations of Qianlong's sixty-year reign. In China, Titsingh effectively functioned as ambassador for his country at the same time as he represented the Dutch East India Company as a trade representative. Early life Dutchmen with Courtesans in Nagasaki c. 1800 Isaac Titsingh was born in Amsterdam, the son of Albertus Titsingh and his second wife, Catharina Bittner. His baptism took place at the Amstelkerk in Amsterdam on 21 January 1745. His father was a successful and prominent Amsterdam surgeon. He thus possessed the means for Titsingh to be brought up with an \\"enlightened education\\" of the 18th century. Titsingh became a member of the Amsterdam Chirurgijngilde (English: Barber surgeon's guild) and received the degree of a Doctorate of Law from Leiden University in January 1765. In March 1764, Titsingh was appointed as a freeman and 1766 went within his employment to Batavia, now Jakarta. Japan, 1779‚Äì1784 Dejima and Nagasaki Bay, circa 1820. Two Dutch ships and numerous Chinese trading junks are depicted. Titsingh was the commercial opperhoofd, or chief factor, in Japan from 1779 to 1780, from 1781 to 1783, and again in 1784. The singular importance of the head of the VOC in Japan during this period was enhanced by the Japanese policy of Sakoku, the self-imposed isolation of Japan that lasted from 1633 to 1853.Edo-Tokyo Museum exhibition catalog. (2000). A Very Unique Collection of Historical Significance: The Kapitan (the Dutch Chief) Collection from the Edo Period ‚Äì The Dutch Fascination with Japan, p. 207. Because of religious proselytizing by Europeans during the 16th century, the Tokugawa shogunate introduced a policy in the early 17th century that no European or Japanese could enter or leave the Japanese archipelago on penalty of death. The sole exception to this \\"closed door\\" was the VOC \\"factory\\" (trading post) on the island of Dejima in Nagasaki Bay, on the southern Japanese island of Ky≈´sh≈´. During this period of seclusion, Titsingh is believed to have been the first Freemason in Japan.Far East Lodge No. 1, \\"A Brief History of Freemasonry in Japan\\"; excerpt, Titsingh \\"is believed to be the first mason to visit Japan\\" in 1779 In this highly controlled context, the traders became the sole official conduit for trade and for scientific-cultural exchanges between Europe and Japan. The VOC opperhoofd was accorded the status of a tributary of the shogun; Titsingh twice had to pay an obligatory annual visit of homage to the shogun in Edo. Given the scarcity of such opportunities, Titsingh's informal contacts with bakufu officials of Rangaku scholars in Edo may have been as important as his formal audiences with the shogun, Tokugawa Ieharu.Edo-Tokyo Museum exhibition catalog, p. 210. During the 18th century there was an improvement of the social position of the Dutch merchants and the treatment of the Dutch vis-√†-vis the Japanese, who showed a higher degree of respect and recognition than in the centuries before. Nevertheless, the average opperhoofd was not interested in the customs or culture of the Japanese. Titsingh showed an almost incredible interest and distinguished himself as an attentive observer of Japanese civilization for a European of his time when compared to his colleagues in Dejima. Titsingh arrived in Nagasaki on 15 August 1779, where he took over the factory from Arend Willem Feith. He established cordial and amicable relations between the interpreters and Japanese; before his arrival there had been constant fights over trade issues and a deep hostility towards the Japanese interpreter, who seemed in trade issues corrupt to the Dutch traders. During his first audience with Ieharu in Edo from 25 March 1780 until 5 April 1780, he met a lot of Japanese daimyo with whom he later established vivid letter correspondence. He became incredibly prominent within the elite society of Edo and became friends with several current and retired daimyo of the area. After a short return to Batavia in 1780, Titsingh returned to Nagasaki on 12 August 1781, due to his successes with the Dutch-Japanese trade in Dejima. There were no Dutch shipments from Batavia in 1782 due to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and thus the trading post in Dejima was cut off from communication with Java during this year. In this year Titsingh stayed in his position as opperhoofd and concerned himself with befriending Japanese scholars, deepening relations with Japanese friends and researching on all scopes of Japanese customs and culture. He also achieved, due to the absence of Dutch shipping that year, important trade talks and great concessions with the Japanese on a long-debated increase to copper exports from Japan to the Dutch traders. Titsingh stayed a total of three years and eight months in Japan before finally leaving Nagasaki at the end of November 1784 to return to Batavia, where he arrived on 3 January 1785. India, 1785‚Äì1792 In 1785, Titsingh was appointed director of the trading post at Chinsurah in Bengal. Titsingh was described by William Jones, the philologist and Bengal jurist, as \\"the Mandarin of Chinsura\\".Jones, William. (1835). Memoirs of the life, writings and correspondence of Sir William Jones, by Lord Teignmouth. London. Batavia, 1792‚Äì1793 Titsingh's return to Batavia led to new positions as Ontvanger-Generaal (Treasurer) and later as Commissaris ter Zee (Maritime Commissioner). While at Batavia, he met with George Macartney who was en route to China. Titsingh's comments were important factors in McCartney's decision to abandon a planned expedition to Japan in 1793. Mccartney's report to London explained: : \\"... the expediency of attempting an intercourse with the Japanese subsists in its full force. Tho from the conversations I had at Batavia with a Dutch Gentleman of a very liberal disposition who was several years resident in Japan, Isaac Titsingh, I collected nothing that could induce me to depend on a favorable reception there, I learned nothing to deter me from the trial. The risk would, at least, be personal, as we have hitherto there no trade to lose. And no moment, if any, could be so propitious for opening up a new trade with them , as when, from the present general confusion of affairs of the Dutch East India Company, their connection with the Japanese is greatly on the decline.\\"Macartney to Dundas, 23 December 1793, British Library, India and Oriental, Factory Records, China, 1084 G/12/20. China, 1794‚Äì1795 Titsingh was appointed Dutch ambassador to the court of the Emperor of China for the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. In Peking (now Beijing), the Titsingh delegation included Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeestvan Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus. (1797).

Titsingh's gruelling, mid-winter trek from Canton (now Guangzhou) to Peking allowed him to see parts of inland China which had never before been accessible to Europeans. His party arrived in Peking in time for New Year's celebrations. By Chinese standards, Titsingh and his delegation were received with uncommon respect and honors in the Forbidden City, and later in the Yuanmingyuan (the Old Summer Palace).van Braam, An authentic account..., Vol. I (1798 English edition) pp. 283‚Äì284. Unlike the unsuccessful British embassy of the previous year under George Macartney, Titsingh made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex imperial court etiquette ‚Äì including kowtowing to the Emperor. Neither the Chinese nor the Europeans could have known that this would be the last appearance by any European ambassador at the Imperial court until after the First and Second Opium Wars of the next century. Titsingh is believed to have been the first Freemason in China,Screech, Timon. (2006).

On 1 March, 1796 the Dutch East India Company, already in decline, was nationalized by the new Batavian Republic.TANAP, The end of the VOC In that year, Titsingh returned to Europe. For some time he lived in Britain, at London and Bath, and was a member of the Royal Society. In 1801 he went back to Amsterdam, and thence to Paris, where he lived until his death.Screech, Timon. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779‚Äì1822, pp. 61‚Äì62 Titsingh died in Paris on 2 February 1812, and is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

Died at Paris the 2nd of February 1812, aged 68 years.] Family Titsingh had a son, Willem, born about 1790 of Titsingh's Bengali mistress. He took his son to Europe in 1800 so that he could be recognised as legitimate. When Titsingh moved to Paris, Willem went with him and attended the French Maritime Academy, graduating in 1810.Screech, Timon. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779‚Äì1822, pp. 56, 62 Library and Collections Titsingh's library and his collection of art, cultural and scientific material was dispersed; and some entered the collections of the French state. Among the Japanese books brought to Europe by Titsingh was a copy of by Hayashi Shihei (1738‚Äì93). This book, which was published in Japan in 1785, deals with Joseon (now Korea), the Ryukyu Kingdom (now Okinawa), and Ezo ( now Hokkaido).Cullen, Louis M. (2003).

After R√©musat's death, Julius Klaproth (1783‚Äì1835) at the Institut Royal in Paris was free in 1832 to publish his edited version of Titsingh's translation.Pouillon, Fran√ßois. (2008). Dictionnaire des orientalistes de langue fran√ßaise, p. 542. Legacy Isaac Titsingh can be described as being the only philosopher employed by the VOC in its almost two hundred years existence and the most sophisticated of all VOC employees in the trading post history of the VOC in Japan (1600‚Äì1853). Due to his extensive private correspondence on religious as well as human topics and his endeavours in the exchanges between the outside world and his own, he can be considered as a true philosopher of the 18th century. Compared to the other VOC employees he was a polyglot, who spoke eight languages (Dutch, Latin, French, English, German, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese). His enthusiasm to introduce the European society to Japanese customs and culture was rooted in his overall passion for Japan and everything Japanese. Therefore, he became a prominent figure, transmitter and interpreter in a two-way cultural, learning and knowledge exchange between the Japanese and the Europeans. For example, he imported Dutch books on European knowledge to Japan. In addition, he collected authentic source materials on Japan, which consisted of the first ever European collection on Japan, entailing printed books, manuscripts, prints, maps, city plans and coins. This collection was thus to form the basis of a then unique history of Japan. This Cabinet Titsingh, consisted hence of two- dimensional materials. Isaac Titsingh can as a result be seen as the founder of European Japonology. Within this scope and his ambitions for a friendly exchange of knowledge, he urged the VOC officials to send learned employees, who could speak Japanese to the trading post in Dejima, to better the European-Japanese relations in Dejima, which can be found in his letter of 28 August 1785. Titsingh had also translated as one of the first Europeans Japanese verses into Latin verses, which can be found together with an essay on Japanese poetry in his collection work on Japanese customs and culture in Bijzonderheden over Japan/Illustrations of Japan. Due to his position as a \\"voyageur philosophique\\", Titsingh had been a member of the following societies: the Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, located in Haarlem, the Asiatic Society of Bengal located in Calcutta and the Royal Society of London. His posthumous work and legacy, especially his collections were to some extent blurred later as he was unable to find Japanese or Chinese translators and scholars in Europe that could help him with the translation of his gathered sources. As his own knowledge of the Sino-Japanese written characters was limited he could only edit the translations of the Japanese accounts that were already prepared by himself and others in Dejima during his stay abroad. The majority of his work thus was published posthumously and consisted of only small parts of his broader overall work. Moreover, some parts were altered and modified to a great extent by his editors and publishers. This was due to the fact that after the bankruptcy of Titsingh's son Willem Titsingh sold the collections and manuscripts, which then were spread all over 19th century Europe. Titsingh's experiences and scholarly research were the genesis for published articles and books. The Batavian Academy of Arts and Sciences (Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen) published seven of Titsingh's articles about Japan. viaLibri: Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen: Verhandelingen (Batavian Academy of Arts and Sciences: Transactions).

His work was more widely disseminated throughout Europe by the beginning of the 19th century.Morewood, Samuel. (1824).

(1781). \\"Eenige Japansche Woorden\\" (\\"Some Japanese Words\\"), Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap (Transactions of the Batabian Academy), Vol. III. was only the early evidence of a project which continued for the rest of his life. On Isaac Titsingh's values and perceptions Titsingh was very keen on having his scholarly questions answered and showed an enormous inexhaustible thirst for knowledge. Looking at his private correspondence three mottos of his behaviour and values can be identified: the rejection of money, as it did not satisfy his enormous thirst of knowledge; an acknowledgment and consciousness of the brevity of life and wasting this precious time not with featureless activities; and his desire to die in calmness, as a \\"forgotten citizen of the world\\". In this light he displayed the values of a European philosopher of the 18th century, who was as well interested in his fellow Japanese scholars. Therefore, he also acknowledged their intellectual competences and sophistication and contributed to an intense exchange of cultural knowledge between Japan and Europe in the 18th century.

The style is properly called Shorin-Ryu.  History  After the death of Anko Itosu in 1915, one of Itosu's most senior students, Choshin Chibana, wanted to continue to teach the Shorin-ry≈´ style of karate he learned from his instructor. Chibana named his system Shorin-ry≈´, but using the Chinese characters for \\"small\\" (Â∞èSHO, chiisai, ko, o - http://www.thejapanesepage.com/node/kanji/kk52.htm) and \\"forest\\" (ÊûóRIN, hayashi - http://www.thejapanesepage.com/node/kanji/k673.htm). Chibana lineage schools are commonly referred to as \\"kobayashi,\\" but this is technically incorrect, as Chibana never used this term to refer to his karate. It was meant to be ‚ÄúShorin‚Äù as tribute to the Shaolin Temple. (Shorin is the Japanese and Okinawan pronunciation of Shaolin). However, he believed strongly that Shorin-ryu was largely Okinawan and purposely modified the first character from the Chinese \\"Shao/Sho\\" so it would retain its originality. As other schools later adopted the name \\"Shorin-ry≈´,\\" the term \\"kobayashi\\" was probably added to describe which exact characters were used to write the term \\"Shorin,\\" but was never meant to be the official name of the style. In 1920, Chibana opened his first dojo in the Torihori district of Shuri. Spellings such as \\"Tottoribori\\" or \\"Tottori-cho\\" are erroneous and incorrect. The old name of Torihori was Tunjumui, so it is unknown where these erroneous names originated. He later taught in other parts of Shuri such as Gibo and Yamakawa, and in Naha at Kumoji and Asato, with the main Chibana dojo being in Yamakawa.Murakami Katsumi, Karate no Kokoro to Waza, 1991.Nakamoto Masahiro, Okinawa Dentou Kobudo, 2006. Chibana taught this style of Shorin-ry≈´ until his death in 1969. Each of his top students went on to create his own branch of Shorin-ry≈´: Nakama Chozo created Shubokan, Yuchoku Higa created Kyudokan, Katsuya Miyahira created Shid≈ç-kan, Isamu Arakaki created Shorin-ryu Kodokan, Sh≈´gor≈ç Nakazato created Shorinkan and Joki Uema created Shubukan. About the name \\"... now the Japanese call it 'kobayashi style' but that is incorrect - but that is all right because only people who do not know Okinawan karate will call it by that name. Since they do not know you must gently remind them or the Okinawan people will laugh at their ignorance. After all, it is funny, many foreign people call it kobayashi shorin-ryu (Â∞èÊûóÂ∞èÊûóÊµÅ)- that is just like saying shorin shorin-ryu. It doesn't make much sense ...\\" Kobayashi = Â∞èÊûó, Shorin = Â∞èÊûó The kanji are never written as Â∞èÊûóÂ∞èÊûóÊµÅ (kobayashi shorin-ryu) but always as Â∞èÊûóÊµÅ (shorin-ryu). The term Kobayashi Shorin-ryu is only used in the west and only by certain branches of Shorin-ryu.

The population supported the Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. At the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912 seven people from Barakovo joined the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps that was formed in support the Bulgarian war effort against the Ottomans. In 1903 the entrepreneur Todor Balabanov founded a timber factory in the village that after the liberation of Barakovo in 1912 employed between 500 and 1000 people. The factory grew to have its own power station, clinic, school, cinema and casino. In the 1930s the prominent Bulgarian poet Nikola Vaptsarov worked there.

When Olaf II of Norway fled up the Storfjorden to escape the forces of Canute the Great, he and his men journeyed up the fjord until he passed through the Norddalsfjorden and reached the Tafjorden. From there they passed north up the Valldalen valley and across the mountains to Lesja on his way to exile in Russia.

Since the load factor is the ratio of two forces, it is dimensionless. However, its units are traditionally referred to as g, because of the relation between load factor and apparent acceleration of gravity felt on board the aircraft. A load factor of one, or 1 g, represents conditions in straight and level flight, where the lift is equal to the weight. Load factors greater or less than one (or even negative) are the result of maneuvers or wind gusts.McCormick, p. 464‚Äì468.  Load factor and g  The fact that the load factor is commonly expressed in g units does not mean that it is dimensionally the same as the acceleration of gravity, also indicated with g. The load factor is strictly non-dimensional. The use of g units refers to the fact that an observer on board an aircraft will experience an apparent acceleration of gravity (i.e. relative to their frame of reference) equal to load factor times the acceleration of gravity. For example, an observer on board an aircraft performing a turn with a load factor of 2 (i.e. a 2 g turn) will see objects falling to the floor at twice the normal acceleration of gravity. In general, whenever the term load factor is used, it is formally correct to express it using numbers only, as in \\"a maximum load factor of 4\\". If the term load factor is omitted then g is used instead, as in \\"pulling a 3 g turn\\".L. J. Clancy (1975). Aerodynamics. Pitman Publishing Limited. London A load factor greater than 1 will cause the stall speed to increase by a factor equal to the square root of the load factor. For example, if the load factor is 2, the stall speed will increase by about 40%.  Positive and negative load factors  Variation of the load factor n with the bank angle Œ∏, during a coordinated turn. Pink force is the apparent weight on board. The load factor, and in particular its sign, depends not only on the forces acting on the aircraft, but also on the orientation of its vertical axis. During straight and level flight, the load factor is +1 if the aircraft is flown \\"the right way up\\", whereas it becomes ‚àí1 if the aircraft is flown \\"upside-down\\" (inverted). In both cases the lift vector is the same (as seen by an observer on the ground), but in the latter the vertical axis of the aircraft points downwards, making the lift vector's sign negative. In turning flight the load factor is normally greater than +1. For example, in a turn with a 60¬∞ angle of bank the load factor is +2. Again, if the same turn is performed with the aircraft inverted, the load factor becomes ‚àí2. In general, in a balanced turn in which the angle of bank is Œ∏, the load factor n is related to the cosine of Œ∏ as : n = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos\\\\theta}. Another way to achieve load factors significantly higher than +1 is to pull on the elevator control at the bottom of a dive, whereas strongly pushing the stick forward during straight and level flight is likely to produce negative load factors, by causing the lift to act in the opposite direction to normal, i.e. downwards.  Load factor and lift  In the definition of load factor, the lift is not simply that one generated by the aircraft's wing, instead it is the vector sum of the lift generated by the wing, the fuselage and the tailplane, or in other words it is the component perpendicular to the airflow of the sum of all aerodynamic forces acting on the aircraft. The lift in the load factor is also intended as having a sign, which is positive if the lift vector points in, or near the same direction as the aircraft's vertical axis, or negative if it points in, or near the opposite direction.  Design standards  Excessive load factors must be avoided because of the possibility of exceeding the structural strength of the aircraft. Aviation authorities specify the load factor limits within which different category of aircraft are required to operate without damage. For example, the US Federal Aviation Regulations prescribe the following limits (for the most restrictive case): * For transport category airplanes, from ‚àí1 to +2.5 (or up to +3.8 depending on design takeoff weight) * For normal category and commuter category airplanes, from ‚àí1.52 to +3.8 * For utility category airplanes, from ‚àí1.76 to +4.4 * For acrobatic category airplanes, from ‚àí3.0 to +6.0 * For helicopters, from ‚àí1 to +3.5 However, many aircraft types, in particular aerobatic airplanes, are designed so that they can tolerate load factors much higher than the minimum required. For example, the Sukhoi Su-26 family has load factor limits of ‚àí10 to +12. The maximum load factors, both positive and negative, applicable to an aircraft are usually specified in the aircraft flight manual.  Human perception of load factor  When the load factor is +1, all occupants of the aircraft feel that their weight is normal. When the load factor is greater than +1 all occupants feel heavier than usual. For example, in a 2 g maneuver all occupants feel that their weight is twice normal. When the load factor is zero, or very small, all occupants feel weightless. When the load factor is negative, all occupants feel that they are upside down. Humans have limited ability to withstand a load factor significantly greater than 1, both positive and negative. Unmanned aerial vehicles can be designed for much greater load factors, both positive and negative, than conventional aircraft, allowing these vehicles to be used in maneuvers that would be incapacitating for a human pilot.

Boland's Mill, the Alto Vetro building, and The Marker Hotel can be seen. The western (inner) basin and Boland's Mill (2009 - concrete mill now demolished) Grand Canal Dock (Irish: Duga na Can√°lach M√≥ire) is a Southside area near the city centre of Dublin, Ireland. It is located on the border of eastern Dublin 2 and the westernmost part of Ringsend in Dublin 4, surrounding the Grand Canal Docks, an enclosed harbour where the Grand Canal comes to the River Liffey. The area has undergone significant redevelopment since 2000, as part of the Dublin Docklands area redevelopment project. The area has been nicknamed \\"Silicon Docks\\"Google by Google and Facebook (a reference to Silicon Valley) as it has become a popular location for multinational technology firms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Airbnb. The area has been the subject of debate over the balance of development and gentrification as well as the subject of derision over the clich√©d nature of its new nickname. Location There is no precise definition of the Grand Canal Dock area but it is generally understood to be bounded by the Liffey to the north, South Lotts Road to the east (or Barrow Street if separating South Lotts as its own area), Grand Canal Street to the south and Macken Street to the west (although some maps show the area including as far west as the corner of Leeson Street and Fitzwilliam Place). Grand Canal Dock contains Grand Canal Dock railway station (also known as Barrow Street Station), the national Waterways Ireland Visitor Centre, the site of the planned U2 Tower, and a number of other notable buildings. Access Grand Canal Dock railway station, accessed from Barrow Street, opened in 2001 (although the line has been in use since 1834). In early 2014, five new Dublin Bikes stations were opened in the area. History The Grand Canal Docks first opened in 1796. At the time they were the world's largest docks. They fell into decline within just a few decades, due mostly to reduced canal usage with the arrival of the railways. The landscape was overwhelmed by Dublin Gas Company's mountains of black coal, along with chemical factories, tar pits, bottle factories and iron foundries. However, bakers and millers maintained business along the southern edge of the inner basin. By the 1960s, the Grand Canal Docks were almost completely derelict. Around 1987 it was decided that Hanover Quay was too toxic to sell. Regeneration began in 1998, when Bord G√°is sold the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) the former gasworks site located in the area between Sir John Rogerson's Quay and Hanover Quay, for ‚Ç¨19 million. The DDDA spent ‚Ç¨52 million decontaminating the land, even though the likely return was estimated at just ‚Ç¨40 million. The decontamination took place under the supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency, between 2002 and 2006. The process involved constructing an underground wall eight metres deep around the affected area, and the contaminated soil being dug out and removed. By the time the decontamination was finished, an inflated property bubble and increased demand in the area (brought on, in part, by the decision by Google to set up its European headquarters nearby), allowed the authority to sell the land for ‚Ç¨300 million. The DDDA injected some of its new funds into the area's infrastructure including seats, street lighting, and civic spaces. A number of significant developments have happened since involving the construction of millions of euros worth of real estate, the arrival of several thousand new residents, and the establishment of what is now sometimes known as Silicon Docks. Sites control and planning On 22 May 2014, it was announced that a fast-track planning process was approved by An Bord Pleanala, with 366,000 square metres of office space and 2,600 homes to be developed across 22 hectares of land in the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock areas under the Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) planning scheme. A number of site plan notices have been posted in the area including the following: *On 14 October 2014, it was reported that U2 would buy 16 Hanover Quay from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for ‚Ç¨450,000. The authority had forced the band to sell its old riverfront studio on Hanover Quay for an undisclosed price in 2002 to allow development of the Grand Canal Harbour area. As part of that deal the authority had promised the band the top two floors of the 32-storey tower it was planning to build on an adjacent quay, a project that was subsequently put on hold. In light of its imminent dissolution and the recent approval by An Bord Plenala for the North Lotts and Grand Canal Planning scheme, the authority decided it would not be proceeding with a proposed compulsory purchase order of 16 and 18 Hanover Quay. *On 4 December 2014, a site plan notice was posted describing the developments to take place at the Boland's Mill site including retaining and restoring old stone buildings to accommodate retail/restaurant/cafe use, cultural/exhibition use, and residences; and the construction of three new towers (13 to 15 storeys, maximum height 53.65m) to accommodate offices and residences. There will also be three new pedestrian routes from Barrow Street, and a new civic waterfront square adjacent to the dock. *On 12 December 2014, two site plan notices were posted for Targeted Investment Opportunities PLC describing the developments to take place at the former Kilsaran Concrete site at 5 Hanover Quay. One notice is for the construction of a 7-storey office building. The other notice is for the construction of a 7-8 storey building to accommodate residences and mixed-use, including 100 apartments, a leisure centre, and space for 1 retail and 2 cafes at ground level. Buildings Several of the buildings surrounding Grand Canal Square, such as the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre, The Marker Hotel, and the HQ office development, were designed by McCauley Daye O‚ÄôConnell Architects. Notable features of the Grand Canal Dock area include: Grand Canal Square The front of the Daniel Libeskind designed Bord G√°is Energy Theatre pictured from the Martha Schwartz Partners designed Grand Canal Square Grand Canal Square Square was completed in 2008. The ‚Ç¨8 million plaza consists of red resin-glass paving that juts out into the water, dotted with illuminated red poles. Planted sections are arranged diagonally across the square. Alto Vetro (2010), and the National Waterways Visitor Centre Alto Vetro The Alto Vetro apartment building was awarded the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland‚Äôs (RIAI) Silver Medal for Housing (2007-2008). It was built by the Montevetro developers Treasury Holdings. Boland's Mill Boland's Mill was a functioning mill until 2001, after which the site, including older stone buildings and taller concrete silos, became derelict. , the site is currently undergoing a ‚Ç¨150 million reconstruction to become Bolands Quay, accommodating new residences, commercial, retail, and civic spaces.

He was educated at Harvard College. During his father's first term as Secretary of State, Fletcher served as Chief Clerk of the United States State Department which, at the time, was the second most powerful office in the State Department. As Chief Clerk, he delivered the news of President William Henry Harrison's death to the new President, John Tyler. Webster graduated from Boston Latin School circa 1829 and from Harvard in the class of 1833. Fletcher Webster married Caroline S. White on November 11, 1836. They raised two sons, Daniel (April 1840 ‚Äì 2 September 1865) and Ashburton (7 December 1847 ‚Äì 7 February 1879), and four daughters but three died in childhood. His third daughter Caroline W.

He had been one of the leading bull riders in the world since the mid-1990s, with two titles at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) and three Professional Bull Riders (PBR) world titles to his credit. Moraes is to be inducted into the Class of 2020 in the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in August. Early years Mor√£es was born April 20, 1970, on his relatives' farm in Quintana, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, but grew up on the ranch his father managed in Cachoeira Paulista. Moraes says he is of Portuguese, Italian and African ancestry. \\"Most of us, we are a big mixture of races\\", Moraes says, \\"We have in us the best of every single breed\\". He grew up wanting to follow in his father's footsteps, but started riding bulls when he was 15. At age 17, he rode in his first professional rodeo in Brazil, and placed second in his third rodeo. Shortly after this, he quit school to ride bulls full-time. Career Mor√£es began his career at small rodeos throughout Brazil, eventually becoming a regular winner on that circuit. After being encouraged by a former PRCA bull riding world champion, Charles Sampson, he set a goal of riding full-time in the United States. After winning Brazilian national titles in 1992 and 1993, he moved to the United States in 1994, riding on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), Bull Riders Only (BRO) and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuits. He immediately emerged as a major star, winning the averageIn rodeo, \\"the average\\" refers to the average score (in rough stock events) or time (in timed events) for all rounds in a competition. at both the Calgary Stampede and the NFR, as well as winning the year's PBR title. Most notably, Moraes became only the third man ever to ride 10 out of 10 bulls at the NFR. Mor√£es would again win the average at the NFR in 1996, and in 1997 was on track to win his second PBR world title until breaking a leg during that summer, forcing Adriano to sit out the rest of the year while Michael Gaffney overtook him for the world title. Mor√£es did become the first man to win a second PBR world title, which he won in 2001. His success on that circuit was instrumental in the expansion of the PBR tour to include events in Brazil. He went on to win a third PBR title in 2006, narrowly beating fellow Brazilian, Guilherme Marchi, despite severe back problems during the PBR Finals. Adriano was the first bull rider in the PBR to win three World Champion Bull Rider titles. In that year, he won an all-time series record of $1.36 million‚Äîmore than three times as much as any other rider. At the end of the 2006 season, his all-time earnings on the PBR circuit were $3.37 million, also a record. Mor√£es has been honored for his accomplishments with a life- size bronze statue of him on Little Yellow Jacket that stands at the entrance to the new PBR headquarters building in Pueblo, Colorado. Mor√£es announced in January 2008 that the 2008 Built Ford Tough Series season would be his final season of bull riding. He qualified for his last PBR Finals in October/November 2008. His last ride saw him buck off of a bull named Grey Dog, as Adriano failed to qualify for the championship round. Mor√£es' overall PBR career earnings at career's end total nearly $3.5 million. In 2011, he received the ultimate honour from the PBR Heroes and Legends Celebration: the Ring of Honour. In 2018, Moraes was inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. Mor√£es qualified for the PBR World Finals a total of 14 times (1994 to 1998 and 2000 to 2008, though he did not compete at the 1997 Finals due to his broken leg). Personal life Mor√£es and his wife Fl√°via, married since 1989, have four children (V√≠ctor, Jerem√≠as, Ant√≥nio, Pedro) and currently have homes in Tyler, Texas and Cachoeira Paulista. A devout Catholic who lists his favorite book as the Bible and the late Pope John Paul II as a personal idol, he is also a member of the Canc√£o Nova missionary community in Brazil. He and his wife opened a Can√ß√£o Nova mission in Texas. He chose to ride only half of the 1998 PBR season in order to participate in a religious mission in Brazil, but nonetheless finished fourteenth in that year's PBR standings, despite suffering another broken leg in the middle of the season.

Her best-known poem, The Three Children (Near Clonmel), has been republished five times since its original publication in The Atlantic Monthly in 1929, and was included in the Oxford Book of Irish Verse (1958). She was born in Dublin, where her father George Shanahan (1856‚Äì1944) was Assistant Secretary of the Irish Board of Works, 1895‚Äì1921 and Honorary Treasurer of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, 1925‚Äì44. Her maternal grandfather was J. J. Clancy (1847‚Äì1928), Irish Nationalist MP for North County Dublin from 1885 to 1918. Via her maternal grandmother Margaret Hickie, she was related to the revolutionary, poet and author Piaras B√©asla√≠. She was educated at St Catherine's Dominican Convent, Sion Hill, Blackrock, Dublin and at Alexandra College. She worked as a secretary in Dublin and from 1929 at the League of Nations in Geneva. She married a Scot, Richard Webster, in 1936 and had five children. When France was invaded in 1940 she moved with her family to D√∫n Laoghaire, Ireland and then to Wallington, Surrey in England, where she lived for the rest of her life. Her most productive period as a poet was the later 1920s. She first achieved significant publication with four of her poems in The Atlantic Monthly (Boston, USA) during 1929. Her poetry was highly regarded by Lord Dunsany (1878‚Äì1957), who helped her to gain publication of The Three Children and Shankill in The London Mercury. Some of her then unpublished poems were broadcast by the Dublin radio station 2RN on 31 May 1930. She also wrote a nativity play The Inn at Bethlehem, related in theme to her poem Epiphany, which was performed at the Theatre Royal, Dublin on 2 December 1928 and broadcast by Radio Eireann on Christmas Eve 1944. The themes of her poetry include birth and childhood, the trials of love, the contrasts of passionate and cautious approaches to life, and Ireland and its predicament. Many have a powerful sense of place, several, including The Three Children and Moon and Swan, being inspired by visits to her Hickie relatives at Clonmel, Co. Tipperary and another, Shankill, by the countryside near her childhood home at Dalkey. She herself admired the poetry of F. R. Higgins and Francis Ledwidge. Although she wrote around 70 poems,Collins (2012), p.194. only eleven were published in her lifetime, and fourteen have been published to date.

Geography Located in the east side of the \\"comarca\\" at the North of Benicadell Mountains. Its district occupies about 2000 ha. the great majority of which are dedicated to agriculture, the other part are gullies and mountain ranges. The highest hills are La Lloma de l'Ullastre (820 m) Pe√±a Blanca (530 m) Algebas√≥ (503 m), other hills are La Buitrera, El Morqui or L'Ermita. The town is situated at the side of L'Ermita hill over 320m. high. The Benicadell Mountains separate the district from Cocentaina County. At the North, West and East there is the plain with many gullies and ravines. Neighboring localities The Castello district borders with next localities: Aielo de Rugat, Beniatjar, Llutxent, Pobla del Duc, El R√†fol de Salem, Rugat and Salem, all of them in the Valencia Province, and L'Orxa in the Alicante Province.  History The first testimonies of the occupation of the Castell√≥ lands can be found at the Llopis and at La Cerradura caves dated at the Neolithic era. other rests of the same time were also found in many district places like L'Ofra, El Planet, La Loseta Etc. Some testimonies of the Valencian Bronze Age are the villages found at the Buitrera, Algebass√≥ or Pe√±a Blanca. About the Roman era, many sites were found all over the district, even should be distinguished for each quality and quantity the recent find of a Roman villa at the L'Ofra place. The Spanish Reconquista of this region was carry out by King James I of Aragon, it was no easy because of the important resistance put by the Muslim leader named Al Azraq whose troops even kill some king knights there. When the conquest was managed by the Christians this territories became part of the Rugat Baron properties given to Lord Bellvis till 1499, year in which were bought by the Duke of Gandia who keep a manor there, some parts of it still remain. Since then the town was named Castell√≥ del Duc, the inhabitants were in the great majority moorish (moriscos), because of that in 1609 when King Felipe III sending off the moorish people from Spain, Castell√≥ became underpopulated. Castell√≥ remains in the Duke states till the nobility dominion abolition with the 1812 Cadiz Constitution.  Economy The local economy has been historically based on agriculture, usually non-irrigated agriculture which was first cereals and vineyard later introducing gradually tree fruit cultivation however Castell√≥ kept an ancient ceramics industry of earthenware jars manufacturers which were so famous in the zone. The progressive decline of the agricultural economy during the last third part of the 20th century turns this activity into a secondary partial one, however still exist there an agricultural cooperative and many fruit stores dedicated to export and trading fruits keeping the sector in a relatively main place. The great and varied number of all kind services which exist in Castell√≤ turn it in a very dynamic and attractive place for the other towns in the zone. It also exist several mixed farming exploitations producing chicken, lamb, pork or eggs. Lately the building sector has become an important part in the Castello economy.

These varying rock-types are responsible for the three major areas of the county, each with its own distinctive scenery and land-use - the Forest of Dean in the west, bordering Wales, the Cotswolds in the east, and in between, the Severn Vale. Forest of Dean The Forest of Dean, situated between the rivers Severn and Wye, is formed of a raised basin of Palaeozoic rocks folded in the Variscan Orogeny, similar to the South Wales Coalfield to the west. Underlain by great thicknesses of the Old Red Sandstone, the basin is filled with Carboniferous limestones, sandstones and coal measures - all of which have contributed to the industrial history of the region. Sometimes called ‚Äòthe prettiest coalfield in Britain‚Äô, the Forest's main coal output was in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, although for hundreds of years coal has been won in the area via ‚Äòfree-mines‚Äô, which could only be operated by local people known as freeminers. One or two survive today. Small-scale mining has been enabled by the exposed nature of the coalfield, with seams often outcropping at surface. Iron-ore has been extracted from labyrinthine mines or 'Scowles' in the limestone since at least Roman times. Several large quarries are still at work in the area, providing Carboniferous Limestone for road surfacing and also Pennant sandstone (see picture) - a popular building stone used notably by Thomas Telford for the Over road bridge, spanning the River Severn near Gloucester. Pennant Sandstone being quarried at Bixslade, in the Forest of Dean The scenic Wye Valley defines the western edge of Dean as well as the England/Wales border. Impressive cliffs have been cut by the river in lower dolomitic sections of the Carboniferous Limestone, most notably at the popular ‚ÄòSymonds Yat‚Äô viewpoint, which affords one of the most famous views in England. Other ‚Äòkarst‚Äô features such as caves, rock pillars and sink holes abound in this area. On the north-east edge of Dean the Silurian period is represented by the distinctive inlier of May Hill, which rises to some 970 feet, crowned with a pine plantation. This isolated hill lies on the north-south Malvern Line and affords superb views from its summit of the Severn Vale, with the Cotswolds forming the horizon beyond. A high degree of faulting complicates the geology of the May Hill area, causing outcrops of Wenlock limestone and Downton Castle Sandstone on its flanks, as well as a possibly Precambrian section of the core of the hill exposed at Huntley quarry. The hilltop is of Llandovery age May Hill Sandstone. Severn Vale To the east is the wide fertile Severn Vale, floored by Triassic 'New Red' sandstones and marls of the Mercia Mudstone Group (formerly known as the 'Keuper Marls'), and Jurassic lias clays further east. The Triassic deposits were formed in a Sahara -like desert when the British Isles lay about 15 degrees north of the equator, whereas the clays represent deep-water sediments. The landscape here is flattish, with the only feature of note a rather weak low scarp which meanders across the vale from SW to NE marking the Triassic/Jurassic border. This is superbly illustrated at the ‚ÄòGarden Cliff‚Äô, Westbury-on-Severn (see picture), where the river Severn has sliced a convenient ‚Äòcut-away‚Äô section of this transition from the red Triassic marls, through the thin Penarth Group (formerly 'Rhaetic') strata, to the lias clays and limestones of the lower Jurassic. The 'Garden Cliff' at Westbury-on-Severn. Triassic marls of the Mercia Mudstone group. The green/grey streaks, known as 'Tea Green marls' are caused by ferrous oxide formed in reducing conditions Traditional building stone in the Severn Vale is scarce, necessitating brick or half-timbered construction in the main, although along the scarp mentioned above harder limestone bands in the Lower Lias (known as 'Blue Lias') have been used in vernacular building. Towards the east side of the Severn Vale the Lias clays are overlain by the sands and limestones of the Middle Lias - well displayed on the slopes of Robinswood Hill, a Jurassic outlier overlooking the city of Gloucester. Further east, forming a rather unstable base to the Cotswold escarpment, are the sands and clays of the Upper Lias. Superficial deposits are widespread. Floodplain alluvium accompanies the course of the Severn itself as well as tributaries such as the Leadon, Chelt, Frome and Cam. Ancient terraces of former, more elevated floodplains mark the position of the major rivers through various glacial and inter-glacial periods in the last Ice Age. A sheet of mainly Jurassic limestone fan gravel probably covered most of the vale in the past but has since been eroded away leaving isolated deposits, most notably the Cheltenham Sand, which forms a well-draining light soil in the Cheltenham- Gloucester region. Inferior oolite exposed below Crickley Hillfort on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment. The Precambrian Malvern hills snake along the background. The Severn Vale is cloaked in fog in this picture The Cotswolds The Middle-Jurassic oolitic limestone series which forms the bulk of the Cotswolds hills contains the best-known of the county's rocks on account of its extensive use throughout the area as a building stone. All from churches to humble cottages have been imbued with a mellow, warm character from the golden yellow colour of the stone - to which many ‚Äòhoney-pot‚Äô Cotswold towns owe their modern popularity and prosperity. The series is divided into the Inferior and Great Oolite Groups. The Inferior Oolite, capping the main north-west facing escarpment, comprises up to 100m of mainly oolitic limestones including the Cheltenham freestone - quarried most extensively at Leckhampton and used widely in the distinctive Regency architecture of Cheltenham. The Great Oolite, forming much of the rather barren Cotswold plateau, encompasses a variety of oolitic, shelly, sandy or marly limestone beds, many of which are used for building purposes such as dry-stone walling and roof tiles. The limestones were predominantly laid down in a shallow warm continental sea, similar to that off the present-day Bahamas, and are rich in fossils of hard-shelled sea creatures such as brachiopods and sea urchins. Clay bands (e.g. the Fuller's Earth Clay at the base of the Great Oolite Series) represent deeper water periods. As the Cotswold dip-slope is followed toward the south-eastern county extremities these clays and mudstones begin to predominate as the Upper Jurassic period Oxford Clay. Most of the Cotswold rivers flow south-eastwards down the dip- slope, supplying the river Thames, whose headwaters lie at the bottom of the slope on the Upper Jurassic clays. Terrace deposits up to 6m thick of mainly local oolitic limestone gravels have been left by the river Thames in its upper course during glacial and peri-glacial periods. Downcutting and a gradual southerly migration of the river has left a succession of four terraces at varying heights, chiefly north of its present course.

The area is home to more than 130 wineries and tasting rooms, including several of the state's notable wineries, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, Columbia Winery, Novelty Hill Januik, Silver Lake, Matthews Winery, and Tenor Wines. While located within the Puget Sound AVA area, the majority of wineries in Woodinville wine country source their grapes from Eastern Washington American Viticultural Areas like Columbia Valley and Yakima Valley. In addition to making wine, several of the wineries in Woodinville wine country are open for tours and tastings, with Chateau Ste.

History Bottle of Brian Carter wine, signed by the winemaker himself, a longtime resident of Woodinville wine country. The Woodinville area developed as a farming and logging community along the Sammamish River Valley in the 1880s. Its close location to the major metropolitan area of Seattle as well as its natural wooded landscape and surroundings made it an inviting area for wineries to develop, with its first winery, Chateau Ste. Michelle, opening up in 1976. In 1988,Columbia winery history Columbia Winery opened up across the street.K. Fay Sideways From Seattle: Exploring the Woodinville Wine Country Novus Vinum Chateau Ste. Michelle's decision to build in Woodinville was a catalyst for the development of this wine country. Founded in 1934, a group of investors bought the winery in 1974 and wanted to move the bulk of the sales and marketing operation to the western side of the Cascade Range where the majority of the state's population resides. The winery then split up its wine making facilities, bringing the white wine production to Woodinville. This decision was also facilitated by the difficult commute through the mountain passes to Eastern Washington during the winter months, after the grapes have been harvested and the wine needs to be monitored and observed for the development of wine faults. Today the winery and tasting room host over 200,000 visitors a year.R. Irvine & W.

Within the United States, there are currently only 25 holders of this title.IMW Until his death in 2009, Master of Wine David Lake also contributed to Woodinville wines. Events Although many of the individual wineries host a number of events throughout the year, there are some annual events which involve multiple wineries. The Passport to Woodinville event was held once a year, usually in April, from 2002‚Äì2014, and provided the public with an opportunity to sample many of the area wineries for a single tasting fee. Participants received a passport filled with labels and information, a glass, and the opportunity to tour many local wineries, some of which were not regularly open to the public. 2014 was the last year for Passport, dubbed \\"Passport: Last Call\\".Final Year for Passport to Woodinville Passport was criticized for limiting people to visiting all of the wineries in a single weekend, which often led to public intoxication and an under-appreciation of the subtle differences in wine flavors. It also put a huge burden on wine tasting rooms, because of the crowds of people swarming the tasting rooms all at once. In 2016, Passport to Woodinville was reinstated as a year-round event, rather than a single event on a particular weekend. For a yearly Passport fee of around $50‚Äì60, the buyer is granted a free tasting at all participating wineries listed in a red life- sized Passport book, which is stamped or signed by each winery to indicate that a free tasting has been redeemed. The new Passport is good at any participating winery during the entire year, except during busy weekends at a small number of select wineries. Because it is distributed year-round instead of concentrated in a single weekend, the new Passport to Woodinville has approximately twice as many participating wineries as the old one (around 60 vs 30). The Saint Nicholas Day Open House is a similar event typically held during the first weekend in December.

Geography  Known as \\"the small Albarrac√≠n\\", Castielfabib is located on a hill near the right bank of the river Ebr√≥n. Located in the northwest corner of Rincon de Ademuz, it is mountainous with elevation ranging between . The most important points of elevation are: Mill Creek (1,338 m), Pe√±a de √Åguila (1,112 m), Peral (1481 m), Cabezo (1,442 m), Macarron (1,222 m), Umbria La Muela (1,068 m) and Cross of the Three Kingdoms (1,552 m), so named because its summit joined the old kingdoms of Aragon, Castile and Valencia. The river Turia flows from the north, serving as the border with Teruel. It flows on the east of Riodeva, bordering Torre Baja. Ebr√≥n River crosses the territory from northwest to southeast, flowing into Turia, the boulevard of Palomarejos runs north and comes to the precipice of the Canaleja. The climate is continental, with prevailing winds from the north and east, the latter bringing rains in April.  Civil parishes  In the municipality of Castielfabib, there are the following civil parishes (pedan√≠as): * Arroyo Cerezo * Cuesta del Rato * Mas de Jacinto * Mas de los Mudos * Los Santos  Bordering towns  The municipality of Castielfabib shares borders with the towns of Ademuz, Torrebaja and Vallanca, all of them situated in the province of Valencia. Farther afield to the west, the municipality borders Salvaca√±ete in the province of Cuenca, Castilla-La Mancha; Torm√≥n, Veguillas de la Sierra, El Cuervo, Tramacastiel and Libros of the province of Teruel, Aragon to the north and the north-east.  History  View of the church-fortress of Castielfabib In Soreico Solana, there are remnants of Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Iberian cultures. West of the town, Faber Castle had been built on a Roman ruin. In 1971, a Roman tombstone fragment was found in Castillejo and has been preserved in the Museum of Prehistoric Valencia. The area was captured in 1210 by Peter II of Aragon, recovered by Muslims shortly afterwards, and captured in the Reconquista by James I. Castielfabib, along with Ademuz, became part of the Kingdom of Valencia, and held in the royal domain under direct control of the crown. In 1304, the village was used as collateral for a loan from the Knights Templar. When they were disbanded, their rights fell to the Order of Montesa which collected tithes from Castielfabib and Ademuz. In 1390, the pope intervened in a dispute between the Montesa and the bishop over religious practises in the village. As a royal town, Castielfabib periodically sent a representative to the Generalitat Valenciana, the Valencian Parliament. During the Peninsular War, Castielfabib was occupied by the French. In the civil wars of the 19th century it was occupied by Carlist forces, who rebuilt the castle; it was later demolished and won back by nationalist forces. The township has remained virtually unchanged since medieval times and has only been a municipality at the expense of the territory of Torrebaja.  Demographics  Economy  The economy is traditionally based on agriculture and livestock. Rivers provide irrigation for apples, pears, vegetables and cereals. In the rain-fed area, cereal and vine are grown. The sheep are the most important, followed by pork and goat. Beekeeping is also practised. The town entrance is from the road N-420, and the Tourism Office of the Rinc√≥n de Ademuz is located at \\"Los Centenares\\" of Castielfabib, along with a rural tourism complex. There is currently a youth hostel, with room service and swimming pool.  Festivals and traditions  * A festival to Our Lady of Grace is held 7‚Äì11 September. * A festival celebrates San Guillermo, the patron of Castielfabib, on 10 February. * Easter celebrations have many traditions. Two poplar trees are brought from the banks of the river on Friday, to be planted in the square on Saturday, with a popular dance that night, the singing of the \\"Aurora\\" in the early hours of Sunday and bellringing and Sunday services.  Cuisine  Castielfabib shares with the other towns of Rincon de Ademuz several recipes such as gachas (porridge), puchero and others, in which pork and its derivatives are central. Almond, apple and other fruits are grown in the fertile plain of the River Ebr√≥n and they are a key ingredient in the local bakery. In recent times other local products such as mushrooms and tomatoes have been promoted.

He was a close friend of Saint Antoninus of Sorrento. Tradition states that Antoninus, fleeing the Lombard invasions, headed for Campania where he ended up at Castellammare di Stabia. Here Catellus was bishop but wishing to become a hermit, gave up his office as bishop and entrusted Antoninus with the task of serving as the town's bishop. Catellus withdrew to Monte Aureo. The desire to remain a hermit himself led Antoninus to convince Catellus to return to his see. Antoninus retired to Monte Aureo himself and lived in a natural grotto. However, Catellus again decided to withdraw to this mountain and dedicate himself only sporadically to the cares of his diocese. An apparition of Saint Michael is said to have convinced the two to construct the stone oratory now known as Monte San Angelo or Punta San Michele. Subsequently, Catellus was accused of witchcraft by a priest named Tibeius (Tibeio) of Stabia and was held captive at Rome until a new pope released him. Catellus returned to Stabia and dedicated himself to expanding the church that he had helped found.Sant' Antonino di Sorrento Inhabitants of Sorrento, meanwhile, convinced Antoninus to settle at Sorrento. Antoninus became an abbot of the Benedictine monastery of San Agrippino, succeeding Boniface (Bonifacio) in this capacity. Veneration Details of his life are based on an account written towards the end of the ninth century by an anonymous chronicler. His life is also mentioned in those sources describing that of his friend Antoninus. The Theatine father Antonio Caracciolo edited one of these in 1626. The cult of this saint was confirmed by the Sacred Congregation on September 13, 1729. A Chapel of San Catello is found in the Castellammare Cathedral.

Scharf managed Maccabi Haifa to three championships, and was Israel national football team manager from 1992 to 1999. Managerial career As manager of the national team in Israel, Scharf is remembered for beating France 3-2 on French soil wrapping up his first European cycle with the national team. Impressive during his tenure as Israeli national coach were the defeats were transformed to draws, and later into victories. His contract was always running for the next two years, and because of the visible improvement in the side, extensions followed. More games on which good results had been gained was a win against Poland, starting the qualifying campaign for the European Championships, as well as a sound defeat of the Bulgarian national team without their star Hristo Stoichkov, again in the first match of the qualifying round, this time for the World Cup in France, with the presence of a strong crowd in their home stadium of Ramat Gan. Scharf's top achievement came when long-time nemesis Austria was defeated, with an impressive score of 5-0, Israel's biggest competitive win against an arguably stronger team. On the negative side were both losses to Cyprus as visitors, as well as the humiliation against Denmark in the Euro 2000 playoffs, which ended the experienced trainer's spell as the national team's manager. Following a short spell with Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Be'er Sheva, Scharf retired, ending a highly prominent coaching career. He is still respected in the local media, and his opinion is periodically sought to characterize what's new and old in Israeli football. His catchphrase on the Israeli \\"Sport5\\" channel is \\"Extraordinary, good!\\" when he appreciates a certain football team or player.

Initially Boyd competed both in North American and international promotions as part of the Royal Kangaroos with his cousin Norman Frederick Charles III. Later on Boyd would team up with Luke Williams as the Sheepherders and compete in many North American federations such as Continental Wrestling Association, Southeast Championship Wrestling and Southwest Championship Wrestling. Boyd would also act as a manager for Luke and Butch Miller as they competed under the \\"Sheepherder\\" name. Professional wrestling career Boyle made his professional wrestling debut in 1966, wrestling initially in his native Australia before he and his cousin travelled to North America to compete as The Royal Kangaroos, a name inspired by the legendary tag team the Fabulous Kangaroos. Boyle and Charles worked mainly for Pacific Northwest Wrestling in Oregon, capturing their first NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship from Kurt and Karl Von Steiger on 11 July 1971, their first reign lasted only 6 weeks but the cousins would win the tag team title a further four times between June 1971 and December 1975. Boyd would also work in the singles ranks capturing the main NWA Pacific Northwest title on 31 July 1971 when he defeated Kurt Von Steiner for the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. Boyd lost the title to Dutch Savage only to regain it a month later on 28 November. On 28 December, Savage once again beat Boyd for the title and subsequently managed to keep it away from him. After working for Pacific Northwest, the Royal Kangaroos headed further north to join Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion. In June 1977, the duo defeated Leo Burke and Keith Hart for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship but dropped it to Leo Burke and his new tag team partner Bobby Burke only a short time later. After their run in Stampede together, the Royal Kangaroos broke up after a disagreement in Calgary Canada over differences in how to promote themselves. Charles remained with Stampede for some time while Jonathan Boyd returned to the Pacific Northwest. On 22 August 1978, Boyd defeated Ed Wiskoski (the future Colonel DeBeers) to win his third NWA Pacific Northwest title. Boyd reigned for six months until he was defeated by PNW's fastest rising star \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper. After his run with PNW ended Boyd began travelling the other NWA territories working under such names as \\"Wild Colonial Boy\\" Johnny Boyd and \\"Maniac\\" Jonathan Boyd. His first stop after leaving the Oregon/Washington territory was due south to the Los Angeles area, specifically the NWA Hollywood Wrestling area. In LA, Boyd teamed up with Coloso Colosetti to defeat Hector Guerrero and Barry Orton to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on 18 May 1979, only to turn around and lose the title to \\"The Twin Devils\\" the very next day. In September, Boyd made his mark on Georgia Championship Wrestling when he beat Ray Candy for the NWA Georgia Television Championship. The mark was short lived as Candy regained the title about 2 weeks later. The Sheepherders In 1981, Butch Miller of the Sheepherders decided that he wanted to return closer to home and went to Australia to wrestle. Luke remained in the United States and started teaming with Boyd as \\"the Kiwi Sheepherders\\" and \\"The New Zealand Sheepherders\\". The duo of Williams and Boyd quickly gained a reputation of one of the most violent, hard hitting teams in the business. One of the first people to feel the wrath of the \\"new and improved\\" Sheepherders was Robert Fuller in South Eastern Championship Wrestling. In later 1981, Robert Fuller and Jos LeDuc had split up when LeDuc turned on Fuller during a match. LeDuc brought in the Sheepherders to be a part of his \\"Commonwealth Connection\\" to fight against Robert Fuller and the entire Fuller family. In December 1981, the Sheepherders won the NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship that had been vacated when Fuller and LeDuc split and defended the titles against Robert Fuller and various partners including his brother Ron Fuller and his cousin Jimmy Golden (later known as Bunkhouse Buck). One act that made the Sheepherders the most hated men in SECW for a while was when the duo attacked and injured (storyline) Jimmy's father Billy Golden. Williams and Boyd kept the upper hand for months as Robert Fuller recruited partner after partner to defeat the dastardly duo. On 11 September 1982, the Sheepherders were finally defeated by Fuller and Golden ending the feud on a high for the face duo as the Sheepherders were \\"run out\\" of the territory. Boyd and Williams moved slightly more north as they began to work in the Memphis, TN based promotion Continental Wrestling Association owned and operated by Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler. Making their debut in October 1982 the team quickly became involved in a heated feud with Jacques Rougeau and Terry Taylor, clashing week after week at the Mid-South Coliseum with the Sheepherders brawling their way to victory time and again. Taylor and Rougeau redeemed themselves in the end by defeating the Sheepherders in a brutal \\"Coal Miner's Glove\\" match. Showing how incredibly resilient the duo was, they returned to the ring later in the night and defeated the territory's main stars Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee. The next feud for Boyd and Williams stands as their most memorable and certainly their most bloody and brutal as the team kicked off a long running feud with The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). The \\"pretty boy\\", well polished Fabulous Ones made and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made for the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started out pretty evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In late 1982, the Sheepherders won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and Mid February, the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On 28 March, the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA. Boyd and Williams resurfaced in Southwest Championship Wrestling only weeks later, continuing their brutal and destructive ways. Their first target was the reigning Southwest Tag Team Champions \\"The Grapplers\\" (Len Denton and Tony Anthony). In May, the Sheepherders won the gold from the duo through nefarious means: before the match Williams and Boyd had bribed the Grapplers' manager Don Carson and promised he would become a tag team champion; Carson turned on the Grapplers mid match to ensure the Sheepherders' victory. The Sheepherders run with the gold was short lived because, in June, Jonathan Boyd legitimately broke both his legs in a car accident which forced the SWCW to name Bobby Jaggers as a replacement for Boyd. After Williams and Jagger lost a non-title match to Bob Sweetan and Sweet Brown Sugar, Williams turned on Jaggers and the titles were vacated. While Boyd was out with the broken leg, Williams was reunited with his old tag-team partner, Butch, straight in from Australia. Once Boyd was recovered enough, he began acting as the Sheepherders' manager despite still on crutches. Over the next year or two, Boyd works mainly as a manager for the Sheepherders and as a booker for SWCW. In 1985, Boyd once again began wrestling as a Sheepherder, but this time he did not team up with Luke Williams but instead teamed with Rip Morgan (a former flag bearer for the Sheepherders) and continued the Sheepherder legacy of violence under the name \\"The Kiwi Sheepherders\\". Boyd and Morgan quickly made a mark on Memphis by beating their longtime opposition the Fabulous Ones for AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on 17 June 1985. The team was soon stripped of the titles due to excessive cheating, but had the titles returned to them when Boyd and Morgan threatened to sue CWA management. Instead of taking the titles from the Sheepherders by stripping them, the Fabulous Ones took the Southern tag team titles from them the old fashioned way ‚Äì 4 times in a row between 5 September and 12 October. After the series of violent matches with the Fabulous Ones came to an end, the Sheepherders came face to face with another team that would turn out to be a constant thorn in their side: The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). Jonathan Boyd reunited with the Sheepherders in the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. In the winter of 1985, the Kiwi Sheepherders and the Fantastics traded wins back and forth with no side gaining a clear advantage in their feud. In January 1986, the Kiwi Sheepherders defeated the teams of Koko Ware and Rick Casey and also the team of Tojo Yamamoto and Dirty Rhodes to reach the finals of a tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions, but in the finals they fell to the Fantastics. The loss to the Fantastics only intensified the Sheepherders' anger, bringing the feud to its high point as the two teams clashed in a \\"No DQ Loser Leaves Town\\" match on 20 January 1986. The Kiwi Sheepherders lost and left Memphis while the Fantastics rode a wave of popularity thanks to the feud. In late November, the Kiwi Sheepherders returned to the CWA for a brief run. Boyd and Bob Hallow (billed as \\"Bigfoot\\") cut through the competition and won a 4th Southern Tag Team championship when they beat Jeff Jarrett and Billy Joe Travis in a tournament to crown new tag team champions. Their run with the titles was brief as Jarrett and Travis won the titles a week later and then ran the Kiwi Sheepherders out of the area in a \\"Loser Leaves Town\\" match a week after beating them for the title. After the Sheepherders On 11 January 1988, Boyd defeated Ranger Ross for the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship in Continental Championship Wrestling. Boyd held the title for just over a month before dropping the gold to \\"Doctor\\" Tom Prichard. On 28 December of that year, Boyd won his last title when he defeated Joe Savoldi for the ICW Heavyweight Title (Savoldi version). Boyd once again only held the title briefly losing it back to Joe Savoldi in January 1989. On 25 December 1989, \\"Lord\\" Jonathan Boyd wrestled and defeated Rex King in his retirement match in Portland, Oregon for the same promotion that gave him his first break in the US, Pacific Northwest Wrestling. Boyd died on 7 August 1999 of a heart attack.

Dad Shah was support by Iraq through local Balochi politician Mir Abdi, who went into self-exile in Iraq for his people national struggle. Dad Shah killed tribal chief Sardar Muhammad Darani of Zahedan. Sardar Darani was the commander-in-chief of Zahedan area during Reza Shah. In 1957, Daad Shah's tribal chiefs who betrayed him, by called him for negotiation and where he was killed in a gun battle by Iranian Forces. Mir Abdi persuaded by the Shah to return to Iran and gave privileges to stop his struggle for Baloch people. The struggle came to an end by an agreement between Iran and Iraq, where Iran stopped support for the Kurdish struggle in Iraq, while Iraq deprived the Baloch from theirs. But later Iraq gave support to Balochi secretly till the 1980s, when Iraq-Iran War began Balochi groups given large amount of support in financial and weapons.

Reddy (born 1948 in India) is a cardiologist and an owner of Prime Healthcare Services, Inc., which owns 45 hospitals in California and the United States.  Life and career  Reddy was born in a rural village called Niduguntapalem, Nellore district in southern India. He graduated from Sri Venkateswara University Medical College in 1973. In 1976 Reddy and his wife immigrated to the United States. Reddy, holding an MD, FACC, and FCCP, is a board-certified physician in internal medicine and cardiology. He is a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology and the American College of Chest Physicians. During two decades of practice, Reddy performed more than 5,000 cardiac procedures (such as coronary angiography and angioplasty, and permanent pacemaker implantations).My Life Shows American Dream Is Achievable , India Tribune, 17 May 2003. Reddy is no longer licensed to practice medicine in California.  Healthcare management and entrepreneurship  In the early 1980s, Reddy founded Desert Valley Medical Group in Victorville, CA and established Primecare Medical Group in 1992. He also founded PrimeRx, with 250,000 managed care patients, generating over $500 million in revenues a headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. He established Desert Valley Hospital in 1994 which today stands as the flagship hospital in the California healthcare system known as Prime Healthcare Services. Desert Valley Hospital has been recognized as a Top 100 Hospital in the Nation on numerous occasions.Desert Valley Hospital recognized again, hospital, reddy, hospitals - Local News - Victorville Daily Press In 2013 eight Prime Healthcare Hospitals were named in the \\"Top 100 Hospitals in the Nation\\" by Truven, formerly Thomson Reuters. Hospitals that receive these awards are noted for their high clinical standards, \\"that achieve the highest national scores based on 14 separate measures of hospital performance - operational, clinical and financial - that affect patients as well as the quality of care in the community.\\" Prime Healthcare Services was recognized as a \\"Top 15 Health System\\" in 2013, the third time they have been on the list in five years.  Charity  Reddy and his family have established the Dr. Prem Reddy Family Foundation, which has supported a number of efforts, including the California University of Science and Medicine, the Dr. Prem Reddy Nursing Laboratory at CSUSB, and the Dr. Prem Reddy Lecture Hall at Western University of Health Sciences. Controversy On 8 July 2007, the Los Angeles Times ran a news story that alleged that the policies of Prime HealthCare Services, Inc. resulted in higher than average profits at the possible cost of patient care. According to the Times story, \\"When Reddy's company, Prime Healthcare Services Inc., takes over a hospital, it typically cancels insurance contracts, allowing the hospital to collect steeply higher reimbursements. It has suspended services ‚Äî such as chemotherapy treatments, mental health care and birthing centers ‚Äî that patients need but aren't lucrative.... On four occasions since 2002, inspectors have found that Prime Healthcare facilities failed to meet minimum federal safety standards, placing their Medicare funding at risk.\\"Daniel Costello, Hospital group rejects system and cashes in, 8 July 2007 In 2005, two former nurses at Desert Valley Hospital won a lawsuit in which they claimed they were improperly fired after they accused hospital management of providing inadequate care to save money and Reddy of repeatedly reporting to work while under the influence of alcohol. In February 1999, Reddy was arrested for allegedly attacking Harry Lifschutz at Desert Valley Medical Group. Reddy jumped over a desk in the doctor's waiting room and allegedly attempted to choke him and take a laptop from Lifschutz's office. Prime Healthcare Services is understood by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the California Department of Justice about concerns over a reported spike in sepsis. The investigation centers around whether the spike in sepsis represents a large public health issue or potential Medicare fraud. Six Prime hospitals ranked in the 99th percentile of U.S. hospitals for sepsis and five were in the 95th percentile. Prem Reddy was personally liable in a negotiated settlement regarding False Claims at 14 Prime Hospitals. Out of the $65 million settlement, he had to pay $3.25 million.

He was a patron and friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Life At Binsey, near Oxford (1862) Boyce was born in Gray's Inn Terrace in London, and was the son of George Boyce, a wine merchant turned pawnbroker.Newall and Egerton (1987), p.4 His sister was the painter Joanna Mary Boyce. He went to school in Chipping Ongar in Essex, and then studied in Paris. In October 1843 he was articled to an architect named Little, with whom he remained for four years, until joining the architectural firm of Wyatt and Brandon. Already disillusioned with architectureNewall and Egerton (1987), p.5 a meeting with the artist David Cox in August 1849 persuaded him to give up the profession and take up watercolour painting instead.Newall and Egerton (1987), p.6 His early work shows the influence of Cox who he met again in Bettws-y-Coed in 1851,Newall and Egerton (1987), p.12 but he went on to develop his own detailed style under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, having met Thomas Seddon and Rossetti in about 1849 and William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais in 1853, in which year he painted in Dinan, Brittany, with Seddon.George Price Boyce RWS (1826‚Äì1897): An Overview at Victorianweb.org (Accessed 2 April 2007) In 1854 he went to Venice, where he sketched subjects recommended to him by the critic John Ruskin.Newall and Egerton (1987), p.14 who corresponded with him during his four months in the city.Newall and Egerton (1987), p.16 Much of his work from the late 1850s concentrated on English landscapes, often incorporating views of vernacular architecture,Newall and Egerton (1987), p.22 especially around the Thames Valley villages of Pangbourne, Mapledurham, Whitchurch and Streatley, and in Sussex and Surrey.

In humans, transaldolase is encoded by the TALDO1 gene. The following chemical reaction is catalyzed by transaldolase: * sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate \\\\rightleftharpoons erythrose 4-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate Clinical significance The pentose phosphate pathway has two metabolic functions: (1) generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced NADPH), for reductive biosynthesis, and (2) formation of ribose, which is an essential component of ATP, DNA, and RNA. Transaldolase links the pentose phosphate pathway to glycolysis. In patients with deficiency of transaldolase, there's an accumulation of erythritol (from erythrose 4-phosphate), D-arabitol, and ribitol. The deletion in 3 base pairs in the TALDO1 gene results in the absence of serine at position 171 of the transaldolase protein, which is part of a highly conserved region, suggesting that the mutation causes the transaldolase deficiency that is found in erythrocytes and lymphoblasts. The deletion of this amino acid can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged spleen and liver) during early infancy. Transaldolase is also a target of autoimmunity in patients with multiple sclerosis. Structure Active site of the transaldolase enzyme highlighting the key amino acid residues (Asp-27, Glu-106, and Lys-142) involved in catalysis. Transaldolase is a single domain composed of 337 amino acids. The core structure is an Œ±/Œ≤ barrel, similar to other class I aldolases, made up of eight parallel Œ≤-sheets and seven Œ±-helices. There are also seven additional Œ±-helices that are not part of the barrel. Hydrophobic amino acids are located between the Œ≤-sheets in the barrel and the surrounding Œ±-helices to contribute to packing, such as the area containing Leu-168, Phe-170, Phe-189, Gly-311, and Phe-315. In the crystal, human transaldolase forms a dimer, with the two subunits connected by 18 residues in each subunit. See mechanism to the left for details. The active site, located in the center of the barrel, contains three key residues: lysine-142, glutamate-106, and aspartate-27. The lysine holds the sugar in place while the glutamate and aspartate act as proton donors and acceptors.; Mechanism of catalysis The residue of lysine-142 in the active site of transaldolase forms a Schiff base with the keto group in sedoheptulose-7-phosphate after deprotonation by another active site residue, glutamate-106. The reaction mechanism is similar to the reverse reaction catalyzed by aldolase: The bond joining carbons 3 and 4 is broken, leaving dihydroxyacetone joined to the enzyme via a Schiff base. This cleavage reaction generates the unusual aldose sugar erythrose-4-phosphate. Then transaldolase catalyzes the condensation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate with the Schiff base of dihydroxyacetone, yielding enzyme-bound fructose 6-phosphate. Hydrolysis of the Schiff base liberates free fructose 6-phosphate, one of the products of the pentose phosphate pathway.

(2003) Ireland. Blackstaff Press. Belfast. The site compares with the Langdale axe industry based in the English Lake District and the quarries at Penmaenmawr in North Wales, where large numbers of stone axes were manufactured. Flakes, rejects and part-finished axes have been found round the hill and peak. It was here that the axes were roughed out before being finished at the sea shore. They were then exported as far afield as south-west Ireland, south-east England and north-east Scotland. No finished axes have been found at the site itself. The \\"Malone Hoard\\", consisting of 19 polished stone axes from porcellanite Tievebulliagh or similar material from Brockley on Rathlin Island, was found at Danesfort house, on the Malone Road, Belfast. Some of the axes were inserted upright in the ground. The axes may be too big and heavy for practical use, so perhaps were meant to be used for ceremonial purposes. They are currently held in the Ulster Museum in Belfast. There is a Bronze Age cairn on the mountain top.

It is refuge for the world's largest population of Great One-horned Rhinoceros. Kaziranga has the highest density of tigers in the World. The park has many Elephant, Water Buffalo and Swamp Deer and is an Important Bird Area. The park has achieved notable progress in wildlife conservation despite several constraints. Kaziranga is a vast stretch of tall elephant grass, marshland and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests crisscrossed by four main rivers‚ÄîBrahmaputra, Diphlu, Mora Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri and has numerous small water bodies. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, documentaries and songs. Seasons The Middle Brahmaputra Valley is one of the rainiest places on earth (see Climate of India), and Kaziranga gets around of rain per year. The park is flooded often by the Brahmaputra which is necessary for maintaining the biological balance of the park. It is not uncommon for the park to be flooded for 5-10 days at a time, and around three-quarters of the Western reaches of the park consisting of the Baguri area is annually submerged. The park roughly experiences 3 seasons‚Äîsummer, monsoon and winter. The dry and windy summer extends approximately from February to May with mean maximum and minimums of and , respectively. The hot and humid Monsoon season extends from June to September. During the monsoon, Kaziranga receives mean rainfall of brought by the South West monsoon.

During winter the shallow Beels and nullahs (small water channel) dry up and the growth of short grasses cover up their beds. The grasses also grow around the perennial Beels. With the end of the monsoon season, herbivorous animals, especially the Rhinoceros rush in these areas for grazing. In the other parts of the park the tall coarse grasses dry up by the month of December and January and are then control burnt by the park staff. After such burning some animals begin to concentrate in the burnt patches and relish the ash and the partially burnt stems of the reeds. With few winter showers fresh grass blades shoot up in the burnt patches attracting larger number of animals to these areas. With the onset of the summer season the grasses in the burnt patches grow up quickly and the tender shoots turn into coarse blades, which no longer attract the animals. The temperature also goes up and the animals prefer to remain near the water sources especially around the numerous perennial beels and water streams inside the park. During the monsoon, the shallow Beels and the nullahs start to get filled up, firstly by the monsoon showers and later by the floodwaters. The animals gradually start moving towards higher grounds, which are situated around the tree forests. When the flood water covers most of the areas the animals migrate to the nearby Karbi Anglong Hills and other adjoining areas.

His work has been credited as influences on Robert Caro, Ralph Nader and others. Early life and education Born in Chicago, Illinois, Ferdinand Lundberg received B.A. and M.A. degrees from Columbia University. Career Early in his career, Lundberg was a business reporter for United Press International, and the Chicago Daily News. From 1927 to 1934 he reported for the New York Herald Tribune. Described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"witty, articulate, opinionated, marvelously well-read and not the least bit shy about telling us exactly what he thinks about America and the mess we've made of it\\", Lundberg was vocal in his contrarian viewpoints, describing the United States as an oligarchy, eviscerating prominent American families including the Rockefellers and Hearsts, and denouncing the United States Constitution while calling for its replacement with a parliamentary system. Several of his dozen-or-so books on these topics were best-sellers. Lundberg's debut book, Imperial Hearst, was lauded by Foreign Affairs as \\"an annihilating study of the newspaper magnate\\" worthy of \\"wide attention\\" while, in modern times, Robert Caro and Ralph Nader have both cited Lundberg's America's 60 Families as early influences on themselves. Betty Friedan, meanwhile, wrote The Feminine Mystique as a rebuttal to Lundberg and Marynia F. Farnham's Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, taking its title from a phrase used by Lundberg in his book. In addition to his journalistic writing, Lundberg also spent 16 years as an adjunct professor of social philosophy at New York University. He was also an editor for the Century Foundation. Personal life Lundberg was married to Elizabeth Young, with whom he had two sons. At the end of his life he lived in Chappaqua, New York.

The last step of the oxidative reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway is the production of ribulose 5-phosphate. Depending on the body's state, ribulose 5-phosphate can reversibly isomerize to ribose 5-phosphate. Ribulose 5-phosphate can alternatively undergo a series of isomerizations as well as transaldolations and transketolations that result in the production of other pentose phosphates as well as fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (both intermediates in glycolysis). The enzyme ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase converts ribose-5-phosphate into phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.  Structure  left R5P consists of a five- carbon sugar, ribose, and a phosphate group at the five-position carbon. It can exist in open chain form or in furanose form. The furanose form is most commonly referred to as ribose 5-phosphoric acid.  Biosynthesis  The formation of R5P is highly dependent on the cell growth and the need for NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), R5P, and ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). Formation of each molecule is controlled by the flow of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) in two different metabolic pathways: the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. The relationship between the two pathways can be examined through different metabolic situations.  Pentose Phosphate Pathway  Conversion of ribose 5-phosphate open chain form to furanose form. R5P is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway in all organisms. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic pathway that runs parallel to glycolysis. It is a crucial source for NADPH generation for reductive biosynthesis (e.g. fatty acid synthesis) and pentose sugars. The pathway consists of two phases: an oxidative phase that generates NADPH and a non- oxidative phase that involves the interconversion of sugars. In the oxidative phase of PPP, two molecules of NADP+ are reduced to NADPH through the conversion of G6P to ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P). In the non-oxidative of PPP, Ru5P can be converted to R5P through ribose-5-phosphate isomerase enzyme catalysis. Isomerization of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate. When demand for NADPH and R5P is balanced, G6P forms one Ru5P molecule through the PPP, generating two NADPH molecules and one R5P molecule.  Glycolysis  When more R5P is needed than NADPH, R5P can be formed through glycolytic intermediates. Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) during glycolysis. Transketolase and transaldolase convert two molecules of F6P and one molecule of G3P to three molecules of R5P. During rapid cell growth, higher quantities of R5P and NADPH are needed for nucleotide and fatty acid synthesis, respectively. Glycolytic intermediates can be diverted toward the non-oxidative phase of PPP by the expression of the gene for pyruvate kinase isozyme, PKM. PKM creates a bottleneck in the glycolytic pathway, allowing intermediates to be utilized by the PPP to synthesize NADPH and R5P. This process is further enabled by triosephosphate isomerase inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate, the PKM substrate.  Function  R5P and its derivatives serve as precursors to many biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, ATP, coenzyme A, FAD (Flavin adenine dinucleotide), and histidine.  Nucleotide biosynthesis  Nucleotides serve as the building blocks for nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. They are composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and at least one phosphate group. Nucleotides contain either a purine or a pyrimidine nitrogenous base. All intermediates in purine biosynthesis are constructed on a R5P \\"scaffold\\". R5P also serves as an important precursor to pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis. During nucleotide biosynthesis, R5P undergoes activation by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase (PRPS1) to form phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). Formation of PRPP is essential for both the de novo synthesis of purines and for the purine salvage pathway. The de novo synthesis pathway begins with the activation of R5P to PRPP, which is later catalyzed to become phosphoribosylamine, a nucleotide precursor. During the purine salvage pathway, phosphoribosyltransferases add PRPP to bases. Activation of ribose 5-phosphate to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase. PRPP also plays an important role in pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis. During the fifth step of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, PRPP covalently links to orotate at the one-position carbon on the ribose unit. The reaction is catalyzed by orotate phosphoriboseyltransferase (PRPP transferase), yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP).  Histidine biosynthesis  Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in humans. Like nucleotides, biosynthesis of histidine is initiated by the conversion of R5P to PRPP. The step of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of ATP and PRPP by ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase, the rate determining enzyme. Histidine biosynthesis is carefully regulated by feedback inhibition/  Other functions  R5P can be converted to adenosine diphosphate ribose, which binds and activates the TRPM2 ion channel. The reaction is catalyzed by ribose-5-phosphate adenylyltransferase  Disease relevance  Diseases have been linked to R5P imbalances in cells. Cancers and tumors show upregulated production of R5P correlated to increased RNA and DNA synthesis. Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency, the rarest disease in the world, is also linked to an imbalance of R5P. Although the molecular pathology of the disease is poorly understood, hypotheses included decreased RNA synthesis. Another disease linked to R5P is gout Higher levels of G6P lead to a buildup of glycolytic intermediates, that are diverted to R5P production. R5P converts to PRPP, which forces an overproduction of purines, leading to uric acid build up. Accumulation of PRPP is found in Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome. The build up is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which leads to decreased nucleotide synthesis and an increase of uric acid production. Superactivity in PRPS1, the enzyme that catalyzes the R5P to PRPP, has also been linked to gout, as well as neurodevelopmental impairment and sensorineural deafness.

He served the Church in the western parts of what is now Canada both before and after Confederation and was an early supporter of the Canadian Indian residential school system. Early life Grandin was born in Saint-Pierre-sur-Orthe, France, on 8 February 1829. He was the ninth son in a family of fourteen children of Jean Grandin and Marie Veillard. He was ordained as a priest in 1854; one month later he was sent by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate to Canada to perform missionary work in what was then Rupert's Land. Upon arrival he was sent to Saint-Boniface, where Bishop Alexandre-Antonin Tach√© was in charge. Grandin was subsequently assigned to a mission at Fort Chipewyan (now in Alberta). He next served at √éle-√†-la-Crosse (now in Saskatchewan) for a number of years. Life as bishop In 1867, Tach√© proposed that the vicariate of Saskatchewan be formed with Grandin as vicar of missions. This took place in 1868; in the same year, Grandin attended the council of Quebec bishops in 1868 to discuss new religious boundaries in the Canadian northwest. As a result of these discussions, St. Boniface was elevated and the suffragan diocese of St Albert was created. In 1871, Vital- Justin Grandin was appointed bishop. Grandin was an early supporter of the Canadian Indian residential school system believing that the best way to civilize Indigenous peoples was to educate the young. In 1880 he wrote a letter to then Public Works Minister Hector-Louis Langevin explaining that boarding schools were the best way to ensure children \\"forget the customs, habits & language of their ancestors\\". Grandin was never completely healthy; he had been a sickly child and also had a speech impediment, and his health deteriorated during his later years. He did however preside over the development and expansion of the Diocese of St. Albert, including the founding of new missions and churches throughout Alberta and the construction of hospitals and schools which, unusually for the time, were administered by members of female religious orders and lay clergy. Grandin's efforts to increase Francophone settlement in Alberta were less successful, but many francophone communities founded at the behest of Grandin (such as Beaumont, Lacombe, and Morinville) still exist in central and Northern Alberta. Bishop Grandin died in office on 3 June 1902. He was declared venerable by the Roman Catholic Church in 1966. Upon his death, Grandin was succeeded by Bishop √âmile-Joseph Legal in the St. Albert diocese.

It started on 2 April 2007 as a culmination of long lasting crisis and degradation of the parliamentary coalition when the President of Ukraine (Viktor Yushchenko) attempted to dissolve the parliament. The following day, in light of impending political unrest, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Francis Martin O'Donnell following an earlier call to deepen democracy and liberalize the economy, exceptionally issued an advisory statement of principles on behalf of the Country Team (followed by a visit by former Estonian President Arnold R√º√ºtel on 23 April). The president signed a presidential decree based on several articles of the Constitution of Ukraine ordering early parliamentary elections in Ukraine to be held on 27 May 2007, though they were later postponed to 24 June 2007. He also ordered the government of Ukraine to finance the appointed elections. The Parliament and the government of Yanukovych called this decree unconstitutional and prevented fund allocation for elections. An appeal against the President's decree was lodged in Ukraine's Constitutional Court, which was considering the appeal. The Constitutional Court was expected to conclude its public hearing on Wednesday, 25 April 2007, following the presentation of the Government and Parliament's submission. The Court would then retire to consider their ruling. Viktor Yushchenko suspended the decree and postponed date of the election in order to have approved legislation on elections, the opposition, and the operation of Parliament. Dismissal of parliament and new elections Leading up to the dissolution of parliament was the eight-month power struggle between the president and the parliament. Ongoing power struggles between the Coalition of National Unity and the opposition supported by the president Viktor Yushchenko frequently resulted in the opposition boycotting the parliament's plenary sessions. Prior to the President's 2 April decree dismissing Ukraine's Parliament, 11 members of the opposition supported the governing Coalition of National Unity (formerly the Anti-Crisis Coalition). The President of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, claimed that the right of individual members of a parliamentary faction to support the governing coalition was contrary to the provisions of Ukraine's Constitution. Article 83 clause six, in what is commonly referred to as the Imperative mandate stated \\"According to election results and on the basis of a common ground achieved between various political positions, a coalition of parliamentary factions shall be formed in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to include a majority of People‚Äôs Deputies of Ukraine within the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine\\". The \\"Imperative mandate\\" provision of Ukraine's Constitution came under strong criticism by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe as being undemocratic. The Parliamentary Assembly in its Explanatory memorandum dated 17 April 2007 had emphasized The week before the president's initial decree, on 2 April, dismissing Ukraine's Parliament, thousands of supporters of the opposition gathered in Kyiv, calling on the President dissolve the parliament. A similar number of supporters of Verkhovna Rada Governing majority also gathered in Kyiv supporting Ukraine's parliament. On 2 April, the President, Viktor Yushchenko, following a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and Speaker of the Parliament Oleksandr Moroz, signed the first decree dismissing Ukraine's Parliament sparking another political and constitutional crisis in Ukraine. At 11 PM the President, in a televised speech to the nation, announced his decree dismissing the parliament and ordering early parliamentary elections to be initially held on 27 May. The Rada, passed a motion declaring the decree unconstitutional, in defiance of the president's decree continued to function, issued orders preventing funds allocation for elections, and canceled the order assigning election commission members. The cabinet, supporting the parliament, refused to allocate funds for the new election. The legality and authority of the President's determination to dismiss Ukraine's previous parliament has been the subject of a challenge in Ukraine's Constitutional Court. On 30 April 2007, on the eve of the Court's ruling on the legality of the President's decrees, Viktor Yushcheko intervened in the operation and independence of Ukraine's Constitutional Court by dismissing three Constitutional Court judges. The President's actions were later determined by Ukrainian courts of have been illegal and one of the judges dismissed has been reinstated; the other two judges resigned. Following the President's intervention the Constitutional Court has not ruled on the legality of the previous parliament's dismissal. Meeting of Verkhovna Rada on 11 April 2007: the empty seats to the left are allocated for the Opposition. In a separate issue, some politicians have claimed that identification cards for voting changed hands, as many deputies do not attend parliament in violation of Article 84 of the Constitution. Story on how Akhmetov card was voting. The Central Election Commission has estimated direct costs of the elections to be at about 340 million UAH ($67 million, ¬£34 million). Official rate UAH/USD = 5.05 Yulia Tymoshenko, leader of the parliamentary opposition, commented on the issue of costs: Political crisis The Constitutional Court of Ukraine is examining an inquiry submitted by a group of 53 members of parliament who question the constitutional legitimacy of the parliament's dissolution. This inquiry is based on interpretation that the President had no authority under Ukraine's constitution to dissolve parliament under the conditions listed in Article 90 Unofficial translation. of the Constitution of Ukraine. which is the only article in Ukraine's Constitution that empowers the President to dismiss Ukraine's Parliament. Instead, the decree mentions Articles 5, 69, 77, 83, 102, and 106. On 4 April, Ivan Dombrovskyy, the Chairman of the Constitutional Court, filed for resignation, stating that he is under pressure. However, the judges rejected it. On 5 April, Yanukovych has announced that during telephone conversation asked the Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer to mediate in the dispute. There was no immediate response from Gusenbauer's office, and Austrian diplomats were surprised by the news about his help request. On 6 April, the Alliance of National Unity tried to compromise by dismissing the individuals from opposition fractions who had joined them and ratifying a parliamentary law banning individual membership in coalitions. Four members of Central Election Commission - Yuriy Donchenko, Ihor Kachur, Bronislav Raykovskyy, and Oleksandr Chupakhin (reportedly affiliated with the Anti-Crisis Coalition) took sickness leave - thus effectively blocked work of commission as there is no quorum. As of 6 April in Constitutional Court, there are constitutional legitimacy questions from the President on an order of the Cabinet Ministers supporting the Verkhovna Rada and from 102 deputies on changes done to constitution in 2004. On 7 April, Feodosiya city court has canceled own order from 5 April that originally disallowed to start elections. Vladimir Kolesnichenko, a spokesperson for the Party of Regions has said that this court ruling is a fake and that the elections are still banned. On 9 April, the Rada has passed a declaration, stating: Furthermore, the Rada called upon the heads of European states, governments, and parliaments to send its representatives to mediate the political crisis. Ukraine's parliament on 9 April, raising the stakes in the country's ongoing political confrontation, stated that it would only support early parliamentary elections a presidential vote is held at the same time. On 10 April, a Luhansk municipal courts' ruling, dated 6 April, banning all preparations for the election was publicly announced. The ruling was a response to an inquiry, submitted by Vladimir Ivanov, a Party of Regions member of parliament. Reportedly, this ruling was canceled. Ivanov has attempted to use labor laws in order to keep his deputy mandate: Five Constitutional Court judges (Dmytro Lelak, Volodymyr Kampo, Viktor Shyshkin, Petro Stetsyuk, Yaroslava Machuzhak), three of whom were appointed under the presidential quota, refused to participate in review of president order unless they will be given protection by law enforcement. They noted that \\"certain political forces, acting through their representatives, publicly apply rude pressure on the individual judges and on the Constitutional Court as a whole.\\" On 12‚Äì13 April, both Yanukovych and Yushchenko agreed to abide by the Court's ruling, regardless of its verdict. Furthermore, Yanukovych stated he might agree to parliamentary elections, if the other parties would also agree to participate, even if the Court rules in favor of the Rada. On 17 April, Ukraine's Constitutional Court, with all 18 judges in attendance, decided to study the appeal against the President's decree non-stop until a final ruling is passed. 11 out of 18 Judges passed this decision. Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko described a Constitutional Court decision to review the President's decree dissolving parliament as \\"a farce,\\" and urged the president to recall the judges appointed on his quota. The Court has yet to make its decision on the appeal, and is scheduled to announce it on 27 April. Tent camp of Alliance of National Unity supporters near the building of the government. Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych address Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly stating that the coalition of the majority in Ukraine biggest concern is not that of elections, but the choice between whether Ukraine will be a state ruled by law and all of the emerging problems will be resolved in courts, or on the streets. Although 17 April was the deadline under established law to submit documents to the Central Election Commission for the registration of party lists, no political force has done so. Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe On 19 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe held an emergency session to consider issues related to Ukraine's current political crisis. The Assembly passed a resolution calling on all parties to disputation to respect the decision of Ukraine's Constitutional Court whilst criticizing Ukraine's Constitution Imperative mandate provisions. Parliamentary Assembly rapporteurs on Ukraine - Hanne Severinsen and Renate Wohlwend commented: The \\"imperative mandate\\" provision of Ukraine's Constitution came under strong criticism by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe as being undemocratic. The Parliamentary Assembly in its Explanatory memorandum had emphasized Opposition Members First Resignations On 20 April, leaders of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko and Our Ukraine have declared that about 150 deputy members of Our Ukraine and Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko have resigned from Ukraine's parliament, as result it claimed that the parliament will be no longer able to operate constitutionally per Article 82. Their resignations have been submitted to Vikor Yushchenko, Ukraine's president, who has accepted their resignation. Dmitry Vydrin from the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT), has declared that he had not written an application on abdication, as nobody has not made this request. According to him, \\"there are three reasons\\" why he did not give his mandate, reports Delo. \\"At first, nobody addressed to me with my proposal. Nobody phoned me and told me to write down this application. So how could I write it?\\" declared the deputy. Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski, Poland's former President, believes that Ukraine must find a political compromise and solution to the current political crisis facing Ukraine. When asked who is to blame he responded: On 25 April, Viktor Yushchenko announced that he has rescheduled the early parliamentary elections to 24 June. On 30 April, the Rada passed a motion calling for presidential and parliamentary elections to be held on 9 December 2007. After negotiations on 4 May, Yanukovych and Yushchenko finally agreed to hold elections in autumn (without specifying a date). Dismissal of Constitutional Court judges and Prosecutor General=Constitutional Court The authority of the President to dismiss Ukraine's parliament was challenged in Ukraine's Constitutional Court amidst concern that the President's actions were unconstitutional in that he had exceeded his authority to dismiss Ukraine's parliament. An appeal against each of the president's decrees was lodged in the Constitutional Court. On 19 April the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe passed a resolution in consideration of a report titled Functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine. (Items 13 and 14) stated: The associated explanatory report under the sub-heading of Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe - Resolution 1549 (2007) Functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine expressed concern that In emphasis the report (item 68) stated On 30 April, on the eve of the Constitutional Court's ruling on the legality of the president's decree dismissing Ukraine's parliament, President Yushchenko, in defiance of the PACE resolution of 19 April intervened in the operation of Ukraine's Constitutional Court by summarily dismissing two Constitutional Court Judges, Syuzanna Stanik and Valeriy Pshenychnyy, for allegations of \\"oath treason.\\" His move was later overturned by the Constitutional Court and the judges were returned by a temporary restraining order issued by the court. On 16 May,Viktor Yushchenko, for a second time, issued another decree dismissing the two Constitutional Court Judges Syuzanna Stanik and Valeriy Pshenychnyy. On 17 May, the Constitutional Court Chairman Ivan Dombrovskyy resigned and Valeriy Pshenychnyy was appointed chairman in replacement. On 23 May, The Constitutional Court of Ukraine acted to prevent the president's undue influence on the court system. The court's ruling was made after Viktor Yushchenko unduly sought to influence the court by illegally dismissing two Constitutional Court judges Valeriy Pshenychnyy and Syuzanna Stanik for allegations of \\"oath treason.\\" Pursuant to Article 149 of Ukraine's Constitution Judges of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine are subject to the guarantees of independence and immunity and to the grounds for dismissal from office envisaged by Article 126, and the requirements concerning incompatibility as determined in Article 127, paragraph two of Ukraine's Constitution On 20 July Susanna Stanik won an appeal against the President in the Shevchenko district court of Kyiv. The Court ruled the President's actions illegal and reinstated Ms Stanik's entitlement as a member of Ukraine's Constitutional Court. According to the ruling, the President is obliged to cancel his decree on discharge of Mrs. Stanik.\\" The other two judges who were also illegally dismissed had previously tendered their resignations and as such were not subject to the courts order. Following the president's intervention the Constitutional Court still has not ruled on the question of legality of the president's actions. Stepan Havrysh, the President's appointee to the Constitutional Court, in prejudgment of the court's decision and without authorization from the Court itself, commented in an interview published on 24 July Oleksandr Lavrynovych, Ukrainian Minister for Justice, in an interview published on 3 August is quoted as saying On 25 March 2008 Ukraine's Supreme Administrative Court ruled the President's dismissal of Suzanna Stanik as a Constitutional Court judge illegal. Ms Stanik's position has been reinstated. The decision is final and not subject to further appeal Prosecutor General Prosecutor General of Ukraine Svyatoslav Piskun breaking into his office, surrounded by Members of the State Protection Department on 24 May 2007. On 24 May, Yushchenko fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Svyatoslav Piskun, who was appointed by Yushchenko himself on 26 April, after Piskun refused to resign his place in the Verkhovna Rada as was required by the Ukrainian law, so as to not hold two positions at the same time. Yushchenko cited Constitution Article 78 which states \\"Where there emerge circumstances infringing requirements concerning the incompatibility of the deputy‚Äôs mandate with other types of activity, the People‚Äôs Deputy of Ukraine shall within twenty days from the date of the emergence of such circumstances discontinue such activity or lodge a personal application for divesting of People‚Äôs Deputy authority\\" and Item 1 of Article 3 of Law No. 2783-IV when issuing his decree on the dismissal of the Prosecutor General. The President appointed Viktor Shemchuk, the Prosecutor General of Crimea, as a replacement to Svyatoslav Piskun. After Piskun's dismissal, thousands of protesters marched to his office in Kyiv protesting his dismissal. Piskun, accompanied by several deputies from the Party of Regions, tried to enter his office in Kyiv, however, were prevented from doing so by the Members of the State Protection Department, with Valeriy Heletiy at their lead. Valeriy Heletiy and the deputies were later joined by the Communist Party leader Petro Symonenko and supporters of the Party of Regions. The Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Vasyl Tsushko, ordered Ukraine's Berkut riot police to surround the building, defying Yushchenko's order for the Ukrainian security services not to get involved in the political conflict. Tsushko responded to Yushchenko's dismissal of Piskun as a \\"coup d'√©tat.\\" On 25 May, Viktor Yushchenko ordered a decree, taking control over 40,000 interior ministry troops. Meanwhile, the troops were acting on orders of the Interior Minister of Ukraine Vasyl Tsushko, who was charged with abuse of office on 25 May. On 26 May, thousands of Interior Ministry troops moved towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv on the President's orders. The troops were only lightly armed with riot gear and no lethal weapons. On their way to Kyiv, the troops were stopped by Ukrainian Traffic Police. Deputy Interior Minister Mykhailo Kornienko stated that about 2,050 troops from 13 out of 25 of Ukrainian oblasts were deployed. According to the Vice Commander of the Interior Ministry troops Mykola Mishakin, about 3,480 troops were deployed near Kyiv. Since their entrance into the capital was blocked by Berkut and the Government Automobile Inspection, the Interior Ministry troops would walk to Kyiv. Mykola Mishakin stated: After over seven hours of discussions, Yushchenko, Yanukovych, and the Verkhovna Rada Speaker have come to an agreement by setting the date for new parliamentary elections on 30 September 2007. After coming to a compromise on an election date, the Verkhovna Rada was given two days to accept the new elections and legally prepare for them. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a bill that would allow funding for the early parliamentary elections, and the Rada approved the necessary laws on 1 June 2007. Yushchenko formally called the election on 5 June 2007, thus ending the political crisis.Ukrainian President Formally Sets Early-Election Date - RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY ReferencesExternal links * BBC news ‚Äî Ukraine leader calls early poll * Council of Europe ‚Äî resolution on Ukrainian Crisis * Council of Europe ‚Äî Explanatory memorandum * Council of Europe ‚Äî Venice Commission:Ukraine Category:Political scandals in Ukraine Political Crisis, 2007 Ukrainian political crisis Category:Government crises ","title":"2007 Ukrainian political crisis"},{"id":"10426636","text":"The National Association for the Support of Long Term Care (NASL) is a United States trade association of ancillary providers of products and services to the post acute care industry.

It was federally recognized in January 1941. For the next three and a half years the squadron was attached to the 77th Observation Group and the 76th Reconnaissance Group at various locales in the United States before arriving at Liverpool, United Kingdom on D-Day, 6 June 1944. After moving across the English Channel to France in August 1944, the 125th Liaison Squadron was attached to the U.S. Ninth Army until V-E Day, participating in the campaigns of northern France, Ardennes, Rhineland and Central Europe, and was awarded the Belgian Fourrag√®re for gallantry during the Battle of the Bulge in July 1945. Over the course of those five years, the 125th flew the Douglas 0-38E, the Curtiss O-52 Owl, and the Stinson L-5 Sentinel.http://www.138fw.ang.af.mil/138fw/resources/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=14178 On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units. The 137th Wing traces its origins to the World War II 404th Fighter Group, which was allocated to the Oklahoma Air National Guard and re-designated as the 137th Fighter Group on 24 May 1946. The unit was founded on 21 November 1946 at Norman, Oklahoma as the 137th Fighter Group, and received its federal recognition on 18 December 1947. The 125th Fighter Squadron returned to Tulsa in November 1945 and flew the F-51D Mustang until February 1947 when it was designated the 125th Fighter Bomber Squadron (Jet) and equipped with the F-84 Thunderjet. After receiving the Spaatz Trophy Award in 1950, the 125th was again ordered to active duty under the Ninth Air Force and sent to England AFB in Alexandria, Louisiana until July 1952. After returning to Tulsa under state control the squadron again flew the F-51 Mustang and the F-80 Shooting Star until becoming part of the 138th Fighter Group (AD) for duty with the Aerospace Defense Command flying the F-86D Sabre in August 1957. January 1960 brought significant change to the 125th as the unit was designated the 125th Air Transport Squadron and assigned to the 137th Air Transport Wing in Oklahoma City. For the next eight years the unit flew the C-97 Stratofreighter, transporting cargo to Vietnam and throughout the world before converting to the C-124 Globemaster II in 1968. The 137th Tactical Airlift Wing received the C-130 Hercules transport in 1972. In October 1972, the 125th was redesignated Tactical Fighter Squadron and converted to the T-33 Shooting Star in preparation for equipping with the F-100D Super Sabre in March 1973. The 125th converted to the A-7D Corsair II in July 1978. After conversion to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the 138th Fighter Wing has participated in Operation Provide Comfort, Operation Northern Watch, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit's deployment to Iraq in 2008 marked their 10th deployment to the Middle East. Additionally, the laser targeting pod system for precision guided munitions employment has been incorporated into the unit mission. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission brought an expansion to the 138th Fighter Wing's mission. The wing acquired three F-16 Block 42 aircraft from the 57th Wing located at Nellis Air Force Base as well as six F-16 Block 42 aircraft from 132d Fighter Wing, Iowa Air National Guard. The 138th FW is also the host unit for the Defense Air Sovereignty Alert mission located at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. BRAC also recommended the realignment of the 137th Airlift Wing, which lost its C-130 transport aircraft in 2008. Since then, as the 137th Air Refueling Wing, it shares the aircraft with the 507th Air Refueling Wing, Air Force Reserve Command, at Tinker AFB. On 14 March 2008 a 138th Fighter Wing-assigned fighter aircraft en route to the Smokey Hill Gunnery Range in Salina, Kansas accidentally dropped a 22-pound, non-explosive practice bomb on an apartment complex in Tulsa, damaging a building foundation and knocking out the power to the building. No one was injured and the 138th Fighter Wing announced that they were investigating the incident themselves.Associated Press, '\\"Oklahoma: Practice Bomb Dropped On Apartments\\", New York Times, 15 March 2008. In 2014 the Air Force Magazine annual almanac issue said that thirteen MC-12 Liberty electronic surveillance aircraft would be assigned to the Air National Guard, creating a new AFSOC-aligned surveillance unit at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma.

Its mission is to raise the profile of polar scientists by providing a continuum of leadership that is both internationally and interdisciplinarily focused, and to stimulate collaborative projects. Several countries (Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States) have their own APECS chapters that focus on the needs and ideas of scholars country-wise. The APECS website serves as the main contact point for APECS members and provides forums sharing news, connecting with other polar researchers, finding jobs, and announcing events relevant to polar research. APECS is an endorsed International Polar Year (IPY) project and is considered one of the major legacies of IPY. History and motivation A crucial event in the formation of APECS was a meeting in Sanga Saby, Sweden, in September 2007. This meeting saw founders and members representatives of two key initiatives combine together under the name of APECS: the International Polar Year Youth Steering Committee (YSC) formed in 2005 and including several national YSC's, and a formative APECS, formed in 2006. The International Polar Year (IPY) Youth Steering Committee (YSC), was founded in 2005 by Amber Church and Tyler Kuhn (co-chairs, Canada), Melianie Raymond (New Zealand), Jenny Baeseman (USA), Hugues Lantuit (Germany), Elie Verleyen (Belgium) and Stef Bokhorst (The Netherlands). Its aims were to ensure that IPY's goals to include the next generation of polar researchers and the world's youth were met. The YSC was designed as a decentralized institution relying on national committees, which rapidly came to life in several countries, including Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, among others. Those committees rapidly gained independence and developed their own networks as exemplified by the creation of the UK Polar Network in 2007. A contributing factor to the success of the YSC's during the IPY was strong support from the IPY International Program Office (IPO), based in Cambridge, UK, who ensured that the goals of the YSC would be heard in the community of senior researchers. The roles of Dave Carlson and Rhian Salmon, in particular, were crucial. The YSC focus was the creation, fostering and promotion of activities geared towards youth by young researchers. It largely focused on the involvement of school children and young adults in polar literacy projects and strengthening the communication between students and young researchers. Progressively, a need for a broader, more encompassing organization specifically geared towards young researchers and early career scientists arose. Discussions on IPY education and outreach forums, similar initiatives in other scientific realms and the encounter of like-minded people created an awareness of the need for an organization driven by and serving early career researchers, focused on science and career development, unlike the YSC. In the Autumn of 2006 to address these needs, Jenny Baeseman (USA), Hugues Lantuit (Germany) and Rhian Salmon (UK) laid the grounds for the rationale, structure, connections and future activities of APECS. The acronym was coined at the time and a nascent APECS was launched massively in early 2007, at the start of the IPY with Jenny Baseman and Hugues Lantuit as co-directors. In March 2007, discussions were initiated by the directors with the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to offer APECS' services as representative of early career researchers in polar science. This early version of APECS then started evolving to serve better the needs of early career researchers interested in the polar regions and the wider cryosphere. The YSC's activities developed concurrently with many (if not most) of the early career researchers involved in both organizations. Its scope, however, was limited in time, since it mainly focused on creating activities during the IPY. The need to ensure the continuation of successful initiatives and activities after the IPY led to brainstorming on post-IPY legacy. At the same time, the increase in young researcher initiatives in polar science started to create some confusion in the scientific community, questioning the structure, coordination and even the relevance of such organizations. To address these issues, a meeting was organized at Sanga Saby outside Stockholm, Sweden in September 2007 to bring together all these groups and prepare some long-term sustainable plans. The meeting was sponsored by the Swedish company Serla, the IPY IPO, and other international polar science entities The key outcomes of this meeting were the decisions to merge these groups, including the YSC, into one organization, retaining the name of APECS, and that APECS should adapt its structure to reflect better the multifaceted nature of its membership. This established APECS as a legacy of the YSC and other IPY projects. A new structure was launched at the end of the meeting including working groups, an advisory committee, an interim Council of the 24 attending participants (see below), an interim Executive Committee elected by the council Kriss Rokkan Iversen (Norway), Narelle Baker (UK), Hugues Lantuit (Germany), Dan Pringle (USA), and Jos√© Xavier (Portugal), and Jen Baeseman (USA) was appointed as an interim director. Kriss Rokkan Iversen received unanimous support of all voters and appointed by the Executive Committee as the interim President of APECS. The Executive Committee and Director were charged with establishing APECS as an organization over the next 6‚Äì12 months. A report of activities in this period was made at the online APECS Council Meeting, 21 May 2008. Key progress included forming an international Advisory Committee of senior researchers and science administrators to provide guidance and support. A website was developed by in kind support from Iceland-based Arctic Portal through the generous support of director Halld√≥r J√≥hannsson. The website was established as a virtual home of APECS and amongst other features, includes study and job opportunities, meetings, news updates, and a discussion forum. The executive committee met in March 2008 in Akureyri, Iceland to address strategic planning for APECS and draft the documents that will help sustain this organization for year to come; The Terms of Reference and the Rules of Procedure. This meeting was coordinated by Halld√≥r J√≥hannsson and supported by the University of Akureyri, Northern Research Forum and the Arctic Portal. The ROP and TOR included a revision from the interim APECS structure to an open Council who elect an Executive Committee. The Council controls issues related to APECS governance and structure, and is expected to act on time scales of months ‚Äì years. The Executive Committee is mandated by the Council with shorter time-scale decision making and running APECS on a day-to-day basis. (See the founding ROP and TOR for details.) The organization now has an International Directorate Office hosted at the University of Troms√∏, Norway. Membership The association represents people with a wide range of scientific expertise and interests including glaciology, geology, geodesy, anthropology, sociology, political science, atmospheric science, oceanography, polar biology, culture and heritage studies, linguistics, space studies, biogeochemistry, and paleontology. Membership in APECS is free and open to all early career scientists interested in natural and social sciences of the polar regions, from undergraduates through assistant professors or equivalent for non-academic positions. Participation by engineers and those interested in the cryosphere in general is also being sought. APECS encourages senior researchers to register on the APECS website and serve as mentors for the organization as well as post job openings and events at their institutions. Future plans APECS will be sponsoring several early career gatherings at IPY events and major research conferences around the world during the International Polar Year.

It is a form of Christian music and a subgenre of gospel music. Like other forms of music, the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. However, a common theme as with most Christian music is praise, worship or thanks to God and Christ.New World Encyclopedia, Gospel Music, Dec 23 2013 Traditional gospel music was popular in the mid-20th century. It is the primary source for urban contemporary gospel and Christian hip hop, which rose in popularity during the late 20th century and early 21st century. Origins and development The origins of gospel music are during American slavery, when enslaved Africans were introduced to the Christian religion and converted in large numbers. Remnants of different African cultures were combined with Western Christianity, with one result being the emergence of the spiritual. Jubilee songs and sorrow songs were two type of spirituals that emerged during the 18th and 19th centuries. Some spirituals were also used to pass on hidden messages; for example, when Harriet Tubman was nearby, slaves would sing \\"Go Down, Moses\\" to signify that a 'deliverer' was nearby. At this time, the term \\"gospel songs\\" referred to evangelical hymns sung by Protestant (Congregational and Methodist) Christians, especially those with a missionary theme. Gospel composers included writers like Ira D. Sankey and Mason Lowry, and Charles B. Tindell. Hymns, Protestant gospel songs, and spirituals make up the basic source of modern black gospel. Original music (1920s-1940s) What most African Americans would identify today as \\"gospel\\" began in the early 20th century. The gospel music that Thomas A. Dorsey, Sallie Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith and other pioneers popularized had its roots in the blues as well as in the more freewheeling forms of religious devotion of \\"Sanctified\\" or \\"Holiness\\" churches -- sometimes called \\"holy rollers\\" by other denominations -- who encouraged individual church members to \\"testify,\\" speaking or singing spontaneously about their faith and experience of the Holy Ghost and \\"Getting Happy,\\" sometimes while dancing in celebration.New World Encyclopedia. \\"Urban Gospel\\" Dec 23 2013 In the 1920s Sanctified artists, such as Arizona Dranes, many of whom were also traveling preachers, started making records in a style that melded traditional religious themes with barrelhouse, blues and boogie- woogie techniques and brought jazz instruments, such as drums and horns, into the church. Thomas Dorsey stretched the boundaries in his day to create great gospel music, choirs, and quartets. Talented vocalists have been singing these songs far beyond Dorsey's expectations. The method, dynamics and power behind the songs are different, but God's message is delivered each and every time. Dorsey, who had once composed for and played piano behind blues giants Tampa Red, Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, worked hard to develop this new music, organizing an annual convention for gospel artists, touring with Martin to sell sheet music and gradually overcoming the resistance of more conservative churches to what many of them considered sinful, worldly music. Combining the sixteen bar structure and blues modes and rhythms with religious lyrics, Dorsey's compositions opened up possibilities for innovative singers such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe to apply their very individual talents to his songs, while inspiring church members to \\"shout\\" -- either to call out catch phrases or to add musical lines of their own in response to the singers. This looser style affected other black religious musical styles as well. The most popular groups in the 1930s were male quartets or small groups such as The Golden Gate Quartet, who sang, usually unaccompanied, in jubilee style, mixing careful harmonies, melodious singing, playful syncopation and sophisticated arrangements to produce a fresh, experimental style far removed from the more somber hymn-singing. These groups also absorbed popular sounds from pop groups such as The Mills Brothers and produced songs that mixed conventional religious themes, humor and social and political commentary. They began to show more and more influence from gospel as they incorporated the new music into their repertoire. In the 1930s gospel music of the civil rights movement was referred to as the black gospel period because this was the most prosperous era for gospel music. The message of many of the civil rights activists was supported by the message gospel music was putting forth. Golden age (1940s-1950s) The new gospel music composed by Dorsey and others proved very important among quartets, who began turning in a new direction. Groups such as the Dixie Hummingbirds, Pilgrim Travelers, Soul Stirrers, Swan Silvertones, Sensational Nightingales and Five Blind Boys of Mississippi introduced even more stylistic freedom to the close harmonies of jubilee style, adding ad libs and using repeated short phrases in the background to maintain a rhythmic base for the innovations of the lead singers. Melodically, gospel songs from this era were more diatonic and conjunct. As \\"the spirit leads the vocalist\\" the melodies would become more chromatic and disjunct, evoking pure spiritual emotion that was congruent with the accompanying body or musicians.Boyer, H: \\"Gospel Music\\", page 35. Music Educators Journal, 1978. Individual singers also stood out more as jubilee turned to \\"hard gospel\\" and as soloists began to shout more and more, often in falsettos anchored by a prominent bass. Quartet singers combined both individual virtuoso performances and innovative harmonic and rhythmic invention -- what Ira Tucker Sr. and Paul Owens of the Hummingbirds called \\"trickeration\\" -- that amplified both the emotional and musical intensity of their songs. By the 1940s, gospel music had expanded to members of all denominations prompting black gospel artists to begin tours and becoming full- time musicians. In this venture Sister Rosetta Tharpe became a pioneer, initially selling millions of records with her ability to drive audiences into hysteria by sliding and bending her pitch as well as accompanying herself on steel guitar.Boyer, H: \\"Gospel Music\\", page 38. Music Educators Journal, 1978. In contrast, Mahalia Jackson used her dusky contralto voice to develop her gospel ballads as well as favouring a more joyful approach to singing the gospel. W. Herbert Brewster wrote \\"Move on Up a Little Higher\\" Jackson's first hit. At the same time that quartet groups were reaching their zenith in the 1940s and 1950s, a number of women singers were achieving stardom. Some, such as Mahalia Jackson and Bessie Griffin, were primarily soloists, while others, such as Clara Ward, Albertina Walker, The Caravans, The Davis Sisters and Dorothy Love Coates, sang in small groups. While some groups, such as The Ward Singers, employed the sort of theatrics and daring group dynamics that male quartet groups used, for the most part women gospel singers relied instead on overpowering technique and dramatic personal witness to establish themselves. Roberta Martin in Chicago stood apart from other women gospel singers in many respects. She led groups that featured both men and women singers, employed an understated style that did not stress individual virtuosity, and sponsored a number of individual artists, such as James Cleveland, who went on to change the face of gospel in the decades that followed.  The 1960s-1980s  Gospel started to break way from the traditional church setting, with the choirs, and just singing hymns. There were more solo artists that emerged during these decades. Gospel artists began to perform more than minister; they started to add more genres to gospel music. Disco Music, funk, jazz and many mainstream genres became a part of gospel music. Rock 'n' roll, country, and rhythm & blues have also been influenced by gospel music. Many blues and R&B; singers began as church musicians and later followed the secular careers. When roots music (which including spirituals) became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, a combination of the powerful rhythm and timbres found in spirituals and \\"hard gospel\\" combined with the instrumentation and lyrical content of R&B; and country contributed to various forms of rock music.0 Gospel's influences Gospel artists, who had been influenced by pop music trends for years, had a major influence on early rhythm and blues artists, particularly the \\"bird groups\\" such as the Orioles, the Ravens and the Flamingos, who applied gospel quartets' a cappella techniques to pop songs in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. These groups based their music on sounds they had been singing in church and were now releasing gospel-styled reworking of songs for a secular audience.Handyside, Chris, A History of American Music : Soul and R&B;, Heinemann Raintree Library, p. 8 The influence of gospel was apparent in new versions of pop standards or new songs in a pop style.Campbell, Michael, Popular Music in America, Schirmer Cengage Learning, 2013, p. 185 Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard were rock 'n' roll pioneers with a religious background. Like other artists, these pioneers were stylistically influenced by gospel and it contributed to their music. Elvis was successful in performing his gospel favorites, \\"Why me Lord,\\" How Great Thou Art, and \\"You'll never walk alone.\\" For all of his success as a rock 'n' roll singer, he only received awards for his gospel recordings.Thurber, Cheryl, Elvis and Gospel Music, The Gospel Music Magazine, 1988 Individual gospel artists, such as Sam Cooke, a former member of the Soul Stirrers, and secular artists who borrowed heavily from gospel, such as Ray Charles, James Brown, James Booker and Jackie Wilson, had an even greater impact later in the 1950s, helping to create soul music by bringing even more gospel inspired harmonies and traditions from rhythm and blues.PBS.org, 20th Century Music, Public Broadcasting ServiceHandyside, Chris, A History of American Music : Soul and R&B;, Heinemann Raintree Library, p.10 Many of the most prominent soul artists, such as Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Wilson Pickett and Al Green, had roots in the church and gospel music and brought with them much of the vocal styles of artists such as Clara Ward and Julius Cheeks. The underlying virtues of soul/R&B; music taken from gospel, is the direct emotional delivery, truth to a spirit and the feeling within a song transmitted to the listener.\\"Soul Music's History, soulmusichistory.net During the 1970s, artists like Edwin Hawkins with the 1969 hit \\"Oh Happy Day\\", and Andra√© Crouch's hit \\"Take me Back\\" were big inspirations on gospel music and crossover successes. Both Hawkins and Crouch incorporated secular music styles into gospel, shaping modern contemporary christian music today.McNeil, W.K., \\"Encyclopedia of American gospel music\\", Routledge, 2010 Secular songwriters often appropriated gospel songs, such as the Pilgrim Travelers' song \\"I've Got A New Home,\\" or the Doc Pomus song Ray Charles turned into a hit \\"Lonely Avenue,\\" or \\"Stand By Me,\\" which Ben E. King and Leiber and Stoller adapted from a well-known gospel song, or Marvin Gaye's \\"Can I Get a Witness,\\" which reworks traditional gospel catchphrases. In other cases secular musicians did the opposite, attaching phrases and titles from the gospel tradition to secular songs to create soul hits such as \\"Come See About Me\\" for The Supremes and \\"99¬Ω Won't Do\\" for Wilson Pickett. Representative songwriters and artists * Charles A. Tindley (1851‚Äì1933) is generally considered the \\"Father of Gospel Music\\".Petrie, Phil. \\"The History of Gospel Music\\" He composed many Christian hymns, including \\"I Shall Overcome\\", which was the basis for the now-famous anthem for the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, \\"We Shall Overcome\\". Other famous songs included \\"We'll Understand It Better By and By\\" and \\"Leave It There\\" among many others. His soulful lyrics, rooted in the depth of feeling that rises from an oppressed people, love, patience and tolerance, rather than hate, revenge or retaliation. His hymns still appear in hymnals and songbooks used by all Christian denominations. * Thomas A. Dorsey (1899‚Äì1993) had such a marked effect on the Golden Age of gospel that sheet music for songs written in his rhythmic, bluesy style were called \\"dorseys\\" at the time.Waterman, Richard Alan. (1951) \\"Gospel Hymns of a Negro Church in Chicago\\" Journal of the International Folk Music Council. Dorsey was an American pianist, arranger and composer of such standards as \\"Peace In The Valley\\", which was one of the first gospel recordings to sell one million copies. Originally focused on secular music, Dorsey began to write music with a religious theme after meeting Tindley at a National Baptist Convention. Initially, his blending of sacred themes with the secular musical styles of blues and jazz was condemned as \\"the devil's music\\" and shunned by conservative Christians. After several years' persistence, however, his style gained in popularity. Perhaps the most famous is \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\", written after losing his wife to childbirth and his newborn son the next day.Ely, Don \\"Georgia\\" Thomas A. Dorsey. Starr Gennett Foundation. Dorsey wrote over 1000 songs in his lifetime and founded The National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in 1932. * Sallie Martin (1895‚Äì1988), who was proclaimed \\"The Mother of Gospel\\" by the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses, worked with Dorsey early in her career. Her performances were characterized by her rough alto voice and the shouting and ecstatic motions associated with the Pentecostal Holiness tradition. After joining Dorsey's choir in 1932, Martin also took over Dorsey's struggling music store, to its benefit. During the 1930s, Martin traveled to organize choruses throughout the South and Midwest. In 1940 Martin left Dorsey's group and began touring. Martin and gospel composer Kenneth Morris formed Martin and Morris, Inc., a publishing company which became the biggest of its kind in the United States. She then formed her own ensemble, the first female group in gospel history, called the Sallie Martin Singers. Martin was actively involved in the civil rights movement, and a Nigerian government building was named in honor of her support for the Nigerian Health Program. * Mother Willie Mae Ford Smith (1906‚Äì1994) * Mahalia Jackson (1911‚Äì1972) * Clara Ward (1924‚Äì1973) * James Cleveland (1931‚Äì1991) * Andrae Crouch (1942‚Äì2015) helped establish the post-Dorsey style of urban contemporary Christian music. Andra√© Crouch was a key figure in the Jesus Music movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and strongly influenced future American artists such as Michael W. Smith and Amy Grant. Though his contemporary music is still subject to the age-old criticism of diluting the sacred message with contemporary music styles, his songs, such as \\"Soon and Very Soon\\", \\"The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power\\", \\"Bless His Holy Name\\", and \\"My Tribute\\" have become staples in churches all around the world and recorded by mainstream artists such as Elvis Presley and Paul Simon. He was one of the first African- American Gospel artists to crossover to mainstream contemporary Christian music. Crouch has won numerous awards and honors over the years including eight Grammy Awards, four GMA Dove Awards, and ASCAP, Billboard and NAACP Awards. In 2004, he became the third-ever gospel artist to have a star enshrined on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1943907 Andrae Crouch awarded star on Walk of Fame * Kirk Franklin * The Winans * The Clark Sisters  See also  *List of gospel musicians General: * Black church *Soul music *R&B; *rock 'n' roll ReferencesRelevant literature *Marovich, Robert. 2015.

(2003). Problems and Possibilities in the Pursuit of Diversity: An Institutional Analysis. Equity & Excellence in Education, 36(3), 213‚Äì224; also Henriksen, Helle Zinner H. H. and Jan J. D. Damsgaard. (2007). Dawn of e-government: An institutional analysis of seven initiatives and their impact. Journal of Information Technology, 22(1), 13‚Äì23. Another meaning refers to institutions as ways of thinking that have a direct impact on behaviors. Under this approach, there are several variations and usages of institutional analysis. In economics, it is used to explain why economic behavior does not conform to the theory of supply and demand. This is a relatively old school of thought that has its roots in the work of early 20th-century economists like Pareto.Pareto, Vilfredo. (1935) [1916]. The Mind and Society. New York: Harcourt. One of the most prominent contemporary figures of institutional analysis in economics is Douglass North,See, among others: Davis, Lance and Douglass North. (1971) Institutional Change and American Economic Growth. London: Cambridge University Press; and North, Douglass and Robert Thomas. (1973). The Rise of the Western World: A New Economic History. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. who received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1993. Sociology has also used institutional analysis since its inception to study how social institutions such as the laws or the family evolve over time. The foundational author of this approach is √âmile Durkheim, also founder of sociology as a discipline.Durkheim, √âmile. (1995) [1915] The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. New York: Free Press; and (1983) [1922] The Division of Labour in Society. London: Macmillan. Since the 1980s, however, there are cross-pollinations between the sociological and economic traditions in institutional analysis. A new focus is to explain how organizations and individuals within organizations make economic and managerial decisions, particularly by investigating the non-rational, non-economic, and non- psychological factors. This movement produced what is known as the New Institutional Analysis.cf. Aranson, Peter H. (1998) The New Institutional Analysis of Politics Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, Vol. 154, No. 4 (Dec. 1998), pp. 744-753 The neoinstitutional approach has several variants. One of them tries to improve economic models based on the theory of public choice, and one of its applications is known as the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework developed by Elinor Ostrom 2009 Nobel Prize for Economics.Ostrom, Elinor. (1990) Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. New York: Cambridge University. Another variant is influenced by organizational sociology and seeks to integrate Max Weber‚Äôs work on bureaucratic mentality.Weber, Max. (1978). Economy and society. Berkeley: University of California Press; and (1976) [1904]. The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism. London: Allen & Unwin.Di Maggio, Paul J. and Walter W. Powell (Eds.). (1991).

Paris: Presses universitaires de France. of institutional analysis influenced by the Durkheimian analysis of social institutions, and the anthropological school of thought established by Marcel Mauss.Marcel Mauss was the nephew and close collaborator of Durkheim. Mauss is one of the founders of cultural anthropology, and is well known for his work on the institutional dimension of gift-giving in pre-modern societies. See Mauss, Marcel. (1969). The gift: forms and functions of exchange in archaic societies. London: Cohen & West. This approach to institutional analysis is also influenced by thinkers such as Cornelius CastoriadisCastoriadis, Cornelius. (1975). L‚Äôinstitution imaginaire de la soci√©t√©. Paris: du Seuil. and Michel Foucault.Foucault, Michel. (1972). Histoire de la folie. Paris: Gallimard, and (1975). Surveiller et punir: naissance de la prison. Paris: Gallimard. The main thrust of this approach is the identification of hidden forms of power that institute behaviors and organizational procedures. Felix Guattari also proposed the use of the term in works such as The Molecular Revolution (1984), as institutional psychotherapy had evolved since its inception in the 1950s.

Created by lyricist, lead singer and producer Richard Perlmutter, the group has been a featured performer with numerous symphony orchestras. Beethoven's Wig has recorded four albums. Each Beethoven's Wig album has received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Musical Album for Children. The group has also received four Parents Choice Awards, and three of its albums have been named American Library Association Notable Recordings. In total the series has been honored with 46 national awards. The performing and recording group features singers Elin Carlson, Jonathan Mack, Susan Boyd, Jon Joyce, Jennifer Barnes and Michael Geiger. Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Symphonies: 2002 The group's first album Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Symphonies was released on Rounder Records in 2002. Prior to that time Perlmutter had released two solo albums, Tin Pan Alley Songs For Children, and Hot Diggity, and produced albums for the Grammy Award winning band Nickel Creek and Saturday Night Live cast member Victoria Jackson. Perlmutter had studied classical guitar, piano, and music composition, and had wanted to write lyrics to classical music. He described his thoughts when he came up with the words \\"Beethoven's wig is very big\\", to the tune of the allegro con brio of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, \\"The words fit perfectly with the first eight notes of the symphony. And the wig was a perfect symbol for classical music.\\" Within a week of the release of the album, Perlmutter was featured on NPR's All Things Considered, and then appeared on NBC's Today Show. The album shot to #6 on Amazon's Hot 100 Sales Chart and held the #1 position on both the Amazon Classical and Children's Music Sales Charts for four months. Pulse magazine called Beethoven's Wig, \\"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!\\" The Los Angeles Times said it was, \\"an irreverent approach to music appreciation.\\" US News and World Report said, \\"Perlmutter's got goofball charm‚Ä¶ the lyrics are truly hilarious!\\" Over the next year, Beethoven's Wig received 15 national awards including a Grammy Nomination for Best Musical Album for Children, and a Parent's Choice Award. It was also designated an American Library Association Notable Recording. Beethoven's Wig begins performing: 2004 When Beethoven's Wig 2 was released in 2004, Perlmutter appeared on NPR's Morning Edition, and his two albums took over the #1 and #2 spot on Amazon's Hot 100 Sales Chart simultaneously. While Perlmutter had not originally conceived of Beethoven's Wig as a performing group, the reception that the albums received convinced him to put together a touring group to perform with orchestras. The group featured Elin Carlson, soprano; Susan Boyd, alto; Jonathan Mack, tenor and Jon Joyce, bass. A breakthrough came in May 2006, when Perlmutter and Beethoven's Wig performed to a sold out audience at Meyerhoff Symphony Hall with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Concept albums and books 2005 - Present In 2005, Perlmutter released \\"Beethoven's Wig: Read Along Symphonies,\\" a children's book illustrated by Maria Rosetti. Then in 2006, he released his first concept album, \\"Beethoven's Wig 3,\\" in which each song featured lyrics set to a classical composition highlighting a different instrument. On the album Perlmutter also began experimenting with the form of a number of classical pieces. He took extremely short excerpts and wrote what were, in essence, little poems set to music. Some, such as an excerpt from Saint-Sa√´ns \\"Carnival of the Animals,\\" which highlights the xylophone, were as short as ten seconds. For this work Perlmutter received his third Grammy Nomination. In 2008, he released ‚ÄúBeethoven's Wig 4: Dance Along Symphonies,‚Äù another concept album in which each song featured lyrics for classical pieces written for dances and marches. In this album he expanded the reach of previous Beethoven's Wig albums by including pieces by American composers Scott Joplin and John Philip Sousa. Perlmutter co-produced the album with Michael Geiger, a bass in the Los Angeles Opera, who has also sung on three of the Beethoven's Wig albums. Beethoven's Wig 4\\" brought Perlmutter his fourth Grammy Nomination. In 2011, Alfred Music published the first Beethoven's Wig Songbook, a piano/vocal edition of all of the works from the first album. Also in 2011, Perlmutter released a new album, Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Piano Classics, featuring his lyrics set to well-known piano works by Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Schubert, Debussy, Joplin and others. The piano works were all performed by Grant Gershon, Associate Conductor of the Los Angeles Opera and Music Director of the LA Master Chorale. The album was recorded at the Village Recorders in Santa Monica, CA. In 2012, the songs from Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Piano Classics were released in an illustrated Beethoven's Wig songbook, published by Alfred Music. The songbook contained piano/vocal sheet music for all the songs, and it included a copy of the original Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Piano Classics CD. The songbook also featured extensive program notes with histories and anecdotes about each song, which are accompanied by humorous illustrations drawn by Perlmutter's son Sammy, who also did the songbook's cover illustration. In addition, there is a foreword by the author in which Perlmutter shares his thoughts about the process of adding lyrics to works of classical music. And he includes a short history of the practice. In 2012, Alfred Music also published a choral edition of the song Beethoven's Wig designed for choirs. When Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Piano Classics was released the first Beethoven's Wig animated short was produced by Smiley Guy Studios. Set to Perlmutter's song ‚ÄúMy Little Chicken,‚Äù it features a relentless hen that roams the world pecking and wrecking everything. In 2012, it was followed up with an animated video of the classic Beethoven's Wig song ‚ÄúBeep Beep Beep,‚Äù with lyrics set to Beethoven's ‚ÄúMoonlight Sonata.‚Äù To date, the Beethoven's Wig series has won a record over 50 National Awards. Perlmutter continues to perform with his group of four Beethoven's Wig singers. Hailed as opening the door to \\"serious music\\" in a way that's fun, Beethoven's Wig is a popular attraction not only with symphony orchestras, but also with college and university ensembles. Perlmutter also presents solo shows, singing Beethoven's Wig songs while accompanying himself on piano, classical guitar and mandolin. Hailed as opening the door to \\"serious music\\" in a way that's fun, Beethoven's Wig is now one of the most honored musical groups in family entertainment.

Capnoides flavulum (Raf.) Kuntze, Fumaria flavula Raf.) is an herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. Its natural habitat is open woods and slopes.  Status and phenology = Threats  Corydalis flavula (yellow fumewort) can be found throughout most of the eastern half of the US and also parts of Canada. It is a pioneer species that requires disturbance to thrive. Disturbance (mostly in the form of flooding as it is a floodplain species) helps to keep the overarching canopy at the right density for its light requirements. Because of this requirement it is threatened primarily due to human land use which often results in conversion of habitat to mowed lawns and managed streams and rivers, removing the disturbance and canopy the plant requires. = Michigan = Corydalis flavula is a state threatened plant in Michigan. It occurs in floodplains under relatively open forest canopy. It is at the north end of its range in the US in Michigan, helping to explain why it is threatened in Michigan and only one other state (Connecticut) in its range. Current focused research on the plant at one of its strongholds shows that it can adapt to some other habitats that mimic the disturbance and canopy cover of a floodplain forest. Given that the plant is in the north end of its range, and the climate change impacts will increase temperatures and flooding due to more intense and frequent rain events in Michigan in the next 50 years, the plant has a good chance of flourishing under these conditions. The National Climate Assessment predicts higher temperatures in all seasons in Michigan (summer differences from current will be larger than winter differences). It also predicts that rain events will be increasingly concentrated in the spring and fall seasons and in fewer, heavier bursts (1-3 inches average), which will increase flooding in all categories of streams. At Ft. Custer Training Center (FCTC) in southwest Michigan, C. flavula was found when an armory was being constructed in 1995. This led to Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs to seek a permit from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources for the take of the plant during the construction of the building. The permit required ten years of monitoring along a transect in a black locust dominated area near the armory construction. At the end of the ten years it was determined that further surveys needed to be conducted elsewhere on the installation, not only because it was apparent the plant occurred elsewhere on the 7,500 acre property, but also because there was the threat of more take due to new construction in 2012.Michigan Army National Guard, 2016. Report on 2016 Corydalis flavula surveys at Fort Custer Training Center and adjacent areas, and summaries of 2007-2016 monitoring. The embedded map shows the potential habitat considered viable in the 2010 consideration of where to survey to manage the construction threat in 2012.Michele Richards, Personal Communication, April 19, 2017 These surveys of the property found C. flavula in extensive areas elsewhere on the installation, some areas having healthy populations across 10s of acres. This photo shows the potential habitat areas for C. flavula, a state threatened plant in Michigan, and Black Locust, an invasive species in Michigan, at Fort Custer Training Center, where research is being conducted on habitat specifics for C. flavula. The management of the species to increase its population is unclear. However, the work being done at FCTC is showing that disturbance is key. Prescribed fire opens up the understory and seems to promote a flush either the year of the burn or the year after, depending on conditions and seasonality of the burn.Department of Defense (DoD), 2012. Fort Custer Training Center Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan. Michigan Army National Guard, Environmental Section. Lansing, MI. Other disturbance events that have promoted it on FCTC lands are large soil erosion events near an existing population, and in one instance a timber harvest.Tyler Bassett, Personal Communication, April 18, 2017 It has also become clear that this plant is not exclusively dependent on floodplains, their soil, their disturbance regime and the overstory particular to a floodplain. Indeed, the plant has been found to flourish under the black locusts (Robinia pseudoacacia) (illustrated by embedded map). Research since the map was developed has found extensive populations in many areas far from a floodplain but very much in a disturbance based system. Black locust as a species is also a pioneer and dependent upon disturbance in its early years. The tree emits an allelopathic chemical that impacts many plants and generally promotes a relatively barren understory. For reasons not yet understood, pale fumewort has taken to black locust understory quite well.  Historical uses  Corydalis flavula belongs to the Ranunculales order, an order of plants that often contains many alkaloids that make plants distasteful to toxic. Early use by Native Americans involved inhalation of the smoke of a charring plant. Because early American medicine gleaned some of the aboriginal understandings of the power of plant alkaloids like heroin for pain and belladonna for hearing issues, it was used for things like staunching a bleeding wound, and as an anti emetic. Chinese medicine uses plants in this genus as a pain reliever, muscle relaxant, and to slow the gastrointestinal system.

Her short story \\"One Thousand Braids and a Governess\\" has been translated into English and published in \\"Voices of Change: short stories by Saudi Arabian women writers\\" edited by Abubaker Bagader, Ava M. Heinrichsdorff, Deborah Akers Her birth in Mecca and her family background is highly influential to her work and outlook. She has reflected on her relationship with the now overhauled and renovated city Mecca, saying: Some of her works in Arabic have been banned. Writing in English was a significant decision for Alem. She has said: > \\"The fact is that my people are drifting away from their own culture, and > many of them no longer have a clue about what I'm writing about. So I find > myself looking for new ways to communicate, for other languages, and English > was the first one that came to hand...'Coming out' in another language is a > way of shedding inhibitions.

The novel covers one year of the lives of Cecile Auclair and her father Euclide, French colonists in Quebec. Like many of Cather's books, the story is driven by detailed portraits of the characters, rather than a narrative plot.  Plot  Book I: The Apothecary The story opens in 1697 in Quebec. Euclide Auclair stands on Cap Diamant overlooking the river, watching as the last ship of the season returns to France. He comes down to dinner with his daughter, C√©cile. After dinner, C√©cile feeds Blinker, a partially disabled man who does some of the heavy chores. Euclide Auclair came to the Quebec colony eight years prior, in the service of Count de Frontenac, as physician and apothecary. His wife has died after an illness, and the duties of housekeeping have devolved upon his daughter C√©cile. The following day, C√©cile and Euclide attend to Reverend Mother Juschereau, who has sprained her ankle. Her father replenishes the hospital supplies while Mother Juschereau tells C√©cile a story. Book II: C√©cile and Jacques On market day, in late October, Euclide goes to buy vegetables to store in his root cellar. A description is given of citizens growing lettuce and root vegetables in cold frames in their cellars during the long winter. He goes to the church to say a prayer and notices Jacques, the son of a dissolute woman, also saying his prayers. C√©cile goes to Governor Frontenac to ask for a pair of shoes for Jacques. He praises her for her charity and industry, and asks if she would like anything for herself. She asks to look at his bowl of glass fruit, and he reminisces about his experiences in Turkey, where the glass was made. Euclide sends C√©cile with medicine to the convent. C√©cile runs into Jacques and sitting in the chapel, she tells him a story. They light a candle. As they leave, they meet Bishop Laval. We learn, in a flashback, that Bishop Laval saved Jacques from freezing in a snowstorm, though Jacques does not entirely remember this. C√©cile takes Jacques to the cobbler to be measured for shoes. She reviews the collection of wooden feet that the cobbler has made to represent the measure of the feet of his wealthy customers. On Christmas Eve day, C√©cile opens a gift that has been sent by her Aunt Clotilde in France ‚Äì a cr√®che (nativity scene). C√©cile and Jacques assemble the figures in a stable of pine branches. Jacques contributes a figure of a beaver to the scene. Book III: The Long Winter The young Bishop Saint-Vallier calls at Auclair's shop for sugared fruit. We learn that Bishop Saint-Vallier has undone the system of education and parish management instituted over twenty years by Bishop Laval. Euclide does not like the young bishop because of his extravagant way of life, his snubbing of the older bishop, and because he believes Saint-Vallier makes poor decisions. Euclide derides him a ‚Äúless like a churchman than a courtier‚Äù. We learn that Blinker was a torturer in the king's service in France, and that he did not wish this trade ‚Äì it was forced upon him. He had come to Quebec to get away from this employment, but is haunted by the deaths of his victims. Book IV: Pierre Charron In June, a fur-trader named Pierre Charron calls on Euclide. He tells many stories to Euclide and C√©cile, and accompanies C√©cile on a visit to friends on the √éle d'Orl√©ans. Book V: The ships from France With many of their fellow townsfolk, C√©cile and Jacques go down to the harbor to watch as five ships arrive from France. There is a general celebration. C√©cile receives packages from her two French aunts containing clothing and jewelry. C√©cile is scheduled to return to France when the ships leave at the end of summer, but is having reservations. She tells her father that she is concerned about who will look after her friend Jacques. Her father takes no notice, and she is quite upset. She goes to the church to pray, and runs into Bishop Laval, to whom she relates her troubles. Book VI: The Dying Count The Count learns that, despite his expectations, he is not being recalled to France. He tells Euclide that he is released from his service and may return to France, but Euclide chooses to remain. The Count tells Euclide that he is dying, and directs him to take the bowl of glass fruit to C√©cile as a gift. Some time later, the Count passes away. The two bishops resolve their differences. C√©cile does not go to France. Epilogue The epilogue takes place fifteen years later, in 1713. Bishop Saint-Vallier returns to New France after thirteen years of absence, including several years of captivity in England, which has left him humbled and changed. C√©cile has married Pierre Charron, and they are raising four boys.

The organizations particularly target the distribution of files via the Internet using peer-to-peer software. Efforts by trade groups to curb such infringement have been unsuccessful with chronic, widespread and rampant infringement continuing largely unabated. Rationale The trade groups also claim that widespread copyright infringement on the Internet hurts sales, in turn affecting the artists who depend on royalties.

IRMA had previously demanded that eircom install content filters or take other steps to block IRMA's copyrighted music from being shared.Eircom rejects record firms' claims, RT√â, April 21, 2008 In November 2008, a group of 34 film and television studios (including Village Roadshow, Warner Brothers, Sony Pictures, Disney and the Seven Network), represented by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) launched action in the Federal Court of Australia against iiNet, Australia's third-largest internet service provider. AFACT alleged that iiNet customers had breached its members' copyright by using peer-to-peer software to share and download films and television programs, and that iiNet had not acted against the alleged file- sharers despite 18 notifications of copyright infringement.Foo, Fran: Film giants pursue file sharers, The Australian, 25 November 2008. The Federal Court found that this was not the case. The case was taken on appeal to the High Court of Australia where it was dismissed unanimously, finding that iiNet \\"had no direct technical power\\" to stop users from downloading copyrighted material illegally. Actions against file sharing services=Litigation The RIAA first noticed that Internet sites were offering unauthorized recordings in early 1997, so the organization began sending cease-and-desist letters to the operators of such sites, leading to voluntary shutdowns of some. In mid-1997, the RIAA took the recording industry's first collective legal action against online file-sharing of music, filing copyright infringement claims against the operators of three U.S.-based MP3 file-sharing sites.A&M; Records, Inc. v. Internet Site Known as Fresh Kutz, Case No. 97-CV-1099 H (JFS) (S.D. Cal., filed June 9, 1997, order to show cause issued June 10, 1997) (settled January 1998).Sony Music Entertainment v. Internet Site Known as FTP://208.197.0.28/, Civil Action No. 97 Civ. 4245 (S.D.N.Y., case filed June 12, 1997) (settled January 1998).MCA Records, Inc. v. Internet Site Known as FTP://Parsoft.com/MP3s, Case No. 97-CV-1360-T (N.D. Tex., case filed June 9, 1997) (settled January 1998). Each case could have resulted in a statutory damage award of over $1 million, but all three were settled out-of- court with permanent injunctions in January 1998. In 1998, the RIAA sued the operators of two more sites, resulting in permanent injunctions and monetary damage awards against the defendants, who were also required to perform community service. In late 1999, RIAA labels sued Napster for providing a peer-to-peer file sharing network for MP3 files. The plaintiffs claimed that Napster \\"facilitate[d] piracy of music on an unprecedented scale.\\"\\"Frequently Asked Questions ‚Äî Napster and Digital Music\\". RIAA Website. Napster became bankrupt during the case; and has since been taken over by Roxio and provides a download service which is sanctioned by the RIAA. In 2002, the RIAA sued Aimster, which provided a similar service. In 2003, MPAA studios sued Grokster and other file sharing services in a case that would eventually go to the Supreme Court of the United States. The court held that producers of technology could be held liable for intent to induce infringement. In 2006, RIAA labels sued the developers of LimeWire, a client for the Gnutella file sharing network. Support of police actions In a controversial May 2006 raid, Swedish National Bureau of Investigation and local police seized the servers of BitTorrent tracker The Pirate Bay, causing a three-day outage.Swedish police shut down major piracy site, AFP. June 1, 2006. The raid appeared to be motivated by pressure from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), a group that filed police complaints in Stockholm and Gothenborg in 2004 and 2005 against The Pirate Bay and sent a letter to Sweden's state secretary requesting action.Roper, Louis. \\"US government behind Pirate Bay raid\\", The Local. June 2, 2006.Doctorow, Cory. MPAA's PirateBay letter to Swedish Sec'ty of State, Boing Boing, June 20, 2006. The raid was publicized as a success by the MPAA, but ridiculed by The Pirate Bay's operators. The 2006 raid was detailed in the documentary Steal This Film. In January 2012, the Hong Kong-based file sharing website Megaupload was discovered to be hosted on servers in the state of Virginia, allowing the US government to take action against it. On January 19, the website was shut down and its founder, Kim Dotcom, along with four others involved in the website, were arrested. The indictment issued claims that Megaupload has cost copyright holders $500 million due to its facilitation of illegal downloads. The MPAA requested Carpathia, Megaupload's server host, to retain Megaupload's 25 petabytes of data in case the MPAA decided to sue Megaupload for copyright infringement. While this data includes information on 66.6 million Megaupload users, the MPAA stated that it is not interested in the identities of individual users. Peer-to-peer spoofing The RIAA has apparently in the past been revealed to and may have admitted to the practice of spoofing, deliberately flooding P2P networks with \\"junk music\\". A further reference to such activity was discovered when computer software and source code along with emails were stolen from US Company \\"Media Defender\\"; their software was designed to facilitate \\"interdiction\\" on all the then known peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The contents of the emails made it clear that both P2P network monitoring and interdiction were undertaken by Media Defender. Denial-of-service attacks Aiplex Software, an India-based technology company, revealed in 2010 that it has made denial-of-service attacks on torrent hosting websites on behalf of movie studios. Internet activists retaliated against Aiplex and industry trade groups with denial-of-service attacks of their own, coordinated through Operation Payback. Lawsuits against individuals From 2005 through 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) saw lawsuits against individual consumers as a way to combat the problem of Internet-based copyright infringement. RIAA President Cary Sherman claimed that the large number of lawsuits filed has \\"arrested the growth of a runaway solution that would have grown worse and worse.\\"\\"RIAA's next moves in Washington\\". ZDNet. May 26, 2006. As of July 2006, the RIAA had brought lawsuits against more than 20,000 people in the United States suspected of distributing copyrighted works. Yet, through 2008, album sales continued to decline from their 1999 peak. Participating plaintiffs The RIAA has brought file sharing lawsuits against individuals naming the following plaintiffs. * EMI labels: Capitol Records, Priority Records, Virgin Records * Sony BMG labels: Arista Records, Bertelsmann Music Group, LaFace Records, Sony Records, Zomba Label Group * Universal Music Group labels: Interscope Records, Loud Records, Motown Records * Univision labels: Fonovisa Records * Warner Music Group labels: Atlantic Records, Elektra Records, Lava Records, London-Sire Records, Maverick Records, Warner Bros.

Barker.\\"Elektra v. Barker\\". Recording Industry vs. The People blog. In that case, Tenise Barker, a 29-year-old nursing student in the Bronx, moved to dismiss the RIAA's complaint for lack of specificity, and on the ground that merely \\"making available\\" does not constitute a copyright infringement.\\"Is 'Making Available' Copyright Infringement?\\". Hollywood Reporter ESQ. In opposing Ms. Barker's motion, the RIAA argued that \\"making available\\" is indeed a copyright infringement. Upon learning of the RIAA's argument, which sought to expand copyright law, the Computer & Communications Industry Association, the U.S. Internet Industry Association, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) submitted amicus curiae briefs supporting Ms. Barker's motion and rebutting the RIAA's argument. The Motion Picture Association of America, in turn, submitted a brief supporting the RIAA. The U.S. Department of Justice submitted a \\"Statement of Interest\\" refuting one argument made by the EFF, but taking no position on the \\"making available\\" issue; the DOJ stated that it has never prosecuted anyone for \\"making available\\".\\"Statement of Interest of US Government in Elektra Barker\\" , page 5, footnote 3. ILRweb.com. The case was argued before Judge Kenneth M. Karas in Manhattan federal court on January 26, 2007. The same issue has been briefed in a more recent case, Warner v. Cassin.\\"Warner v. Cassin\\" Recording Industry vs. The People blog. January 2007. In March 2008, Judge Karas ruled in \\"Barker\\" that simply \\"making available\\" (such as dropping a file in a shared folder) did not constitute copyright infringement. Amnesty programs Between September 2003 and April 2004, the RIAA, through its Clean Slate Program, offered individual file sharers amnesty for past infringements, \\"on the condition that they refrain from future infringement,\\"\\"Clean Slate Program\\". RIAA Website. and delete the infringing material. Individuals were no longer eligible for amnesty once they had been sued. The program is now discontinued. The RIAA states this was an educational initiative about illegal file sharing, and was stopped due to increased public awareness in the issues. The program may also have been stopped due to the low number of takers.1,108 people signed up to the Clean Slate program, according to \\"RIAA Drops 'Clean Slate'\\". Fraser Lovatt, Digital-Lifestyles.org, April 21, 2004.

PCWorld.com. A lawsuit brought in California state court, Parke v. RIAA, alleged the RIAA had committed fraudulent business practices by offering the program.\\"Parke v. RIAA, Complaint\\". September 9, 2003. Collection of evidence The RIAA and MPAA contracted MediaSentry, on behalf of plaintiff labels and studios, to collect information about IP addresses sharing potentially infringing files on peer-to-peer networks. Collected information included lists of potentially infringing files an IP address reports as available for downloading, files actually downloaded by MediaSentry from an IP address, and dates and times of the observations. In the United States, MediaSentry is not licensed as a private investigator in some of the states in which observed files are physically located. Because of this, beginning in February 2008, some defendants have challenged the legality of MediaSentry's practices, by seeking to exclude evidence collected by MediaSentry from the lawsuits, and by filing complaints with state licensing boards. The RIAA asserted that MediaSentry is not a private investigator, so does not require licensing in any jurisdiction. Nevertheless, sometime in 2008 the RIAA quietly discontinued using MediaSentry's services. A February 2008 redesign of MediaSentry's website removed a section on \\"litigation support services\\" which described \\"gathering evidence for civil/criminal litigation and prosecution\\". Early settlement offers In February, 2007, the RIAA launched an 'early settlement program' directed to ISP's and to colleges and universities, urging them to pass along letters to subscribers and students offering early \\"settlements\\", prior to the disclosure of their identities. When accepted, these offers can save the RIAA the expense to procure the identities through a Doe lawsuit naming multiple defendants. The settlement letters urged ISP's to preserve evidence for the benefit of the RIAA and invited the students and subscribers to visit an RIAA website for the purpose of entering into a \\"discount settlement\\" payable by credit card.\\"RIAA Adopts New Policy, offers Pre-Doe settlement option if ISP Holds Logs Longer, Asks ISP's to Correct Identification Mistakes\\" Recording Industry vs. The People blog. February 13, 2007. By March 2007, the focus had shifted from ISP's to colleges and universities.\\"RIAA targets university students\\" (Variety.com)Elizabeth Lauten (April 4, 2007). \\"Recording industry battles piracy\\" The East Carolinian (East Carolina University) The average settlement amount offered by the RIAA is around $3,000, but it depends on the number of infringementsFisher, Ken (March 26, 2007). \\"Students largely ignore RIAA instant settlement offers\\". Ars Technica. In one case in 2008, 18 UC Berkeley students were informed by the RIAA's lawfirm that they were infringing on copyrights through the use of Limewire. They were offered a settlement of $750 per song in order to avoid legal action. Identification of defendants Between 2002 and 2003, the RIAA attempted to get Verizon to disclose the identities of file-sharing customers based on a simple one-page subpoena. Verizon attorney Sarah Deutsch challenged the subpoena's validity on procedural and privacy grounds.Verizon's copyright campaign Declan McCullagh In December 2003, this failed when a federal appeals court overturned a lower court order. The RIAA claims this procedure was sanctioned by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but the appeals court ruled that the DMCA regulation applies only to data actually hosted by an Internet service provider, rather than data on a customer's computer. The United States Supreme Court declined to review this ruling in 2004. As a result, the RIAA must now file individual civil suits against each accused file-sharer, and the ISP and alleged file- sharer have more legal avenues for preventing disclosure of their identity, making the entire process much more expensive, slow and complicated. The court opinion was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. The RIAA typically files suits against multiple Does. The RIAA names defendants based on ISP identification of the subscriber associated with an IP address, and as such do not know any additional information about a person before they sue. After an Internet subscriber's identity is discovered, but before an individual lawsuit is filed, the subscriber is typically offered an opportunity to settle. The standard settlement is a payment of several thousand dollars to the RIAA, and an agreement not to engage in file-sharing of RIAA music. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, American Civil Liberties Union and Public Citizen oppose the ability of the RIAA and other companies to \\"strip Internet users of anonymity without allowing them to challenge the order in court\\". The RIAA's methods of identifying individual users have led to the issuing of subpoenas to a dead grandmother,\\"I sue dead people\\". Ars Technica.

It has found California colleges and universities to have received the most pre-litigation letters and copyright infringement notices. In 2005, Patricia Santangelo made the news by challenging the RIAA's lawsuit against her. While she succeeded in getting the lawsuit against her dismissed two years later, her children were then sued.

In one file-sharing case, the RIAA has been referred by the defendants as \\"a cartel acting collusively in violation of the antitrust laws and of public policy, by tying their copyrights to each other, collusively litigating and settling all cases together, and by entering into an unlawful agreement among themselves to prosecute and to dispose of all cases in accordance with a uniform agreement, and through common lawyers, thus overreaching the bounds and scope of whatever copyrights they might have\\". In Arista v. Limewire this was as well alleged by the defendants and referred to in the defendants counterclaim. See, e.g. UMG v. Lindor,\\"RIAA Moves to Strike 'Copyright Misuse' Affirmative Defense in UMG v. Lindor\\". Recording Industry vs. The People blog.

The motion to strike the charges is pending, and was scheduled to be taken under consideration by the Court on October 2, 2007. See also Arista vs. Limewire\\"Limewire counterclaim in Arista vs. Limewire\\". ilrweb.com. for a detailed overview. In February 2008 it was alleged by a group of artist managers & lawyers that the RIAA has been withholding settlements from artists for several years. The RIAA gained the money through lawsuits claiming to defend the rights of artists, although none of the artists whose music was 'illegally' downloaded reportedly received any of the settlement money. In September 2008, Charles Nesson filed a counterclaim on behalf of Joel Tenenbaum for abuse of process, claiming \\"ulterior purposes\\" of intimidation of other users.\\"RIAA v. Joel Tenenbaum - Docket\\". CyberOne: Law in the Court of Public Opinion blog. Law.Harvard.edu. Determination of damages By US Copyright Law, between $750 and $30,000 in damages can be sought for copyright infringement. The RIAA typically seeks $750 per song file in statutory damages. In UMG v. Lindor,\\"UMG v. Lindor\\". RIAALawsuites.us. the defendant argued that the RIAA's damage theory was unconstitutional because it sought 1071 times the actual cost per track in online stores ($.70). After a Brooklyn Federal Court judge upheld the legal theory behind the RIAA's assessment of damages in November 2006, UMG dropped the lawsuit. In 2008, federal judge Xavier Rodriguez ruled that teenager Whitney Harper would only have to pay $200 in damages per song that she shared on the KaZaA network, instead of the $750 per song that the RIAA was seeking. Since KaZaa did not expressly inform Harper that her actions were illegal, Rodriguez determined that she had unknowingly committed copyright infringement. In Capitol v. Thomas, a Minnesota mother was ordered to pay $222,000 ($9,250 per song) in damages to the RIAA for illegally sharing 24 songs on Kazaa. Before they first sued, the RIAA offered a settlement of $5,000, which Thomas refused. She later refused a second settlement of $25,000, which would have been donated to music industry persons in need. After three trials and multiple appeals, at one point of which statutory damages awarded were $1,920,000, the Supreme Court refused to hear Thomas's case in March 2013. Thomas maintains that it will be impossible for the RIAA to collect the $222,000 fee due to her inability to pay. Awarding of costs to prevailing parties In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, the ACLU of Oklahoma Foundation, and the American Association of Law Libraries submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of the motion for attorneys fees that has been made by Deborah Foster in Capitol Records v. Debbie Foster, in federal court in Oklahoma, requesting that attorney's fees be awarded to the defendant and alleging a pattern of inadequate investigation and abusive legal practices by the RIAA. The RIAA asked the Court not to accept the amicus curiae brief, claiming that the \\"Movants attempt to paint a false picture of Plaintiffs and the recording industry run amok\\".\\"RIAA Opposes Motion For Leave to File Amicus Brief in Capitol v. Foster\\" Recording Industry vs. The People blog. August 28, 2006. On February 6, 2007, the attorney's fee motion was granted.\\"Judge Grants Debbie Foster's Attorneys Fees Motion in Capitol v.

Foster\\". Recording Industry vs. The People blog. July 16, 2007 In an Oklahoma case, Capitol Records v. Deborah Foster,\\"Capitol Records v. Debbie Foster\\". RIAALawsuits.us. the RIAA was forced to dismiss a case after a woman filed a motion for leave to make a motion for summary judgment and attorneys fees, stating that she had nothing to do with file sharing and that her only nexus to the case was that she had paid for internet access. The judge ruled that the RIAA's withdrawal of the case‚Äîafter one and a half years of litigation‚Äîdid not immunize it from possible liability for attorneys fees, holding that the defendant was a \\"prevailing party\\" under the Copyright Act. The Court subsequently ruled that defendant was entitled to be reimbursed for her reasonable attorneys fees, since the RIAA's pursuit of its case was, at best, \\"marginal\\", and was being pursued to extract a settlement from someone who was clearly known not to be the direct infringer. The Court noted that the mere fact that Ms. Foster was a person who paid for an internet access account was not a basis for a copyright infringement lawsuit against her. Ms. Foster's motion for attorneys fees had been supported by an amicus curiae brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Association of Law Libraries, and ACLU Foundation of Oklahoma. Other instances in which the RIAA was known to have been forced to back out of a case to avoid a loss, are Priority Records v. Brittany Chan in Michigan, Virgin Records v.

Although there is evidence that the lawsuit program has reduced the amount of files offered by large file- sharers, one source stated in 2006 that there was a limited effect on those who offer less than 1000 files. Overall, the lawsuits have had a negligible effect on the availability of files at any random time.Bhattacharjee, S., Lertwachara, K, Gopal, R. and Marsden, J, \\"Impact of Legal Threats on Online Music Sharing Activity: An Analysis of Music Industry Legal Actions\\", 49 (2006) Journal of Law and Economics 91.

The RIAA has also been criticized for bringing lawsuits against children, including 12-year-old Brianna LaHara of New York City in 2003 and 13-year-old Brittany Chan of Michigan.

Loughlin was born in Leeds, England. Her father, Thomas, was a boot and shoe operative of Irish descent. When Anne was 12 her mother died, and she had to care for her four sisters (two of whom were to go on to marry trade union officials). When she was 16 her father died, and Anne became the family breadwinner, starting work in a Leeds clothing factory for 3 pence an hour. In 1915, aged 21, she became a full-time organiser for the National Union of Tailor and Garment Workers (NUTGW) ‚Äì the union to which she was to devote her whole career. The following year, she took charge of a strike of 6,000 clothing workers in Hebden Bridge. She showed a talent for journalism, and a recognition of the sorts of things that would make young women read the union paper, The Garment Worker. She penned a series of articles in the late 1920s entitled The Woman Worker at Home, in which she instructed 'bachelor girls' on diet (tips on various ways to cook eggs), exercise and make-up. However, clothing workers, especially in London, were confronted with increased use of lower-paid workers; earnings remained low, and there was a growing discontent among the workforce in general. The NUTGW was based in Leeds, and most full-time officials came from the Leeds region; the London membership felt divorced from the centre of union power. There were also religious differences that heightened the tensions. The London membership was mainly Jewish and Protestant, while the Catholic minority in Leeds provided most of the leading officials: the National Secretary (Andrew Conley) was a Catholic, as was the London District Secretary (Bernard Sullivan), and there was Anne herself. The London organiser of the NUTGW was Sam Elsbury, founder member of the Communist Party and as combative a personality as Andrew Conley. The United Clothing Workers at first recruited rapidly in London, with quite substantial minorities in Leeds and Glasgow. However it ran into serious difficulties over strike action within two months of its formation. Apart from bitter hostility from Conley, backed by the TUC, there were growing problems with strategy and tactics within the Communist Party, which led ultimately to Elsbury's expulsion. By 1933 the United Clothing Workers was a small group in the East End of London with about two hundred members, and it was finally disbanded in 1935. Anne Loughlin moved into the top leadership of the union during the 1930s. She developed skills that would be put to great use during the Second World War. In December 1939 she was appointed to the advisory panel for the production of army clothing. She also served on the Ministry of Labour and National Service subcommittee on the wholesale clothing trade. The challenges for the union were great during the war and its aftermath ‚Äì acute labour shortages (with the loss of over a third of its workers to the forces and urgent war work), concentration of the industry and the rationing of materials. In 1942 Loughlin was elected as chairman of the General Council of the TUC (upon which she had served since 1929). She was only the second woman, after Margaret Bondfield, to hold this post and the first to preside at the annual conference (Bondfield missed out on this, having been called on to serve in the Ministry of Labour early in her year as chairman). In 1943 Anne Loughlin was made a DBE, an honour she accepted in the belief that it would open doors for the union. She went on to serve on the Royal Commission on Equal Pay (1944‚Äì1946) and was one of its honourable dissenting voices. She felt strongly that there was no justification for paying women less than men for the same job and argued that the introduction of equal pay would not have the destabilising effects prophesied in the main report by the Commission. In 1948 Anne took over from her mentor and close friend Andrew Conley as union general secretary. Her election was by no means a foregone conclusion, since there were several strong candidates. In particular, it was thought that the Communist Mick Mindel stood some chance (in the atmosphere of 1947) and the anti-Communist cause was represented by the long-serving (since 1905), devoutly Roman Catholic Bernard Sullivan. Historians of the union described Conley's ability as 'a mixture of Irish blarney, charm and sheer inspiration' in persuading young women in the NUTGW that not only were they up to the job of union organiser, but that they could do it better than most men. This was motivated by his fear of what factionalism could to a union which had won its unity only with great effort (after a complicated amalgamation and the earlier attempt at a breakaway by the communist-led National Minority Movement). Those who knew her commented on her ability to express complex arguments lucidly and in terms that everyone could understand. Employers respected this barely woman, and she could gain concessions that others could not. She was not afraid to speak out about the injustices she found ‚Äì whether these were in small, back-street clothing workshops or in large public companies employing thousands of clothing workers. But she was equally quick to laud those firms which introduced welfare facilities. Whether it was laying the foundation stone for a new factory, speaking at a professional association dinner or prize giving at a technical college (she believed passionately in the need for a well-skilled work-force), she would rise to the occasion. However, she was also known to have a rough tongue when dealing with some of her colleagues. Her great professional disappointment came in this postwar period with the dissolution of the Clothing Industry Development Council (CIDC). There had been calls for something of this nature in the deliberations of the Heavy Clothing Working Party (published in 1947), upon which Loughlin had served, along with other union representatives and employers. What was proposed was a central body that would, among other things, carry out scientific research, promote training and improve marketing and design. Anne keenly felt the need for this. Plans for the CIDC were announced by the President of the Board of Trade, Harold Wilson, in March 1948. Employers, to Loughlin's distress, were unhappy about the proposals ‚Äì in particular, the compulsory levy and the almost equal representation offered to unions as to employers' organisations. However the orchestrated protest by the employers was not enough to stop parliamentary approval of the establishment of the CIDC in November 1949. In late 1952, shortly after Anne had announced her retirement from the post of general secretary due to ill-health, the council was dissolved and replaced by an equally short-lived, and less effective, voluntary body. Dame Anne Loughlin's retirement was a long one. On retirement she made a clean break with the union, and there appear to be no records of what she did during her remaining years. In 1975 the NUTGW marked International Women's Year with a plaque in the executive boardroom (renamed the Anne Loughlin Room) marking her achievements. It was unveiled by the TUC general secretary, Len Murray. Dame Anne herself was too ill to attend but was represented by one of her sisters, Mrs. Agnes McLaughlin. Four years later, on 14 July 1979, she died intestate, leaving ¬£33,419 net (¬£34,159 gross).

She hosted one of the most celebrated salons of the Ancien R√©gime. She also led the development of the Hospice de Charit√©, a model small hospital in Paris that still exists today as the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. She was the wife of French finance minister Jacques Necker, and is often referenced in historical documents as Madame Necker. Early life and education Portrait by Jean-Etienne Liotard, c. 1761 Born in May 1737, Curchod was the daughter of Louis Antoine Curchod, Protestant pastor of the Swiss village of Crassier near Lausanne, and Magdelaine d'Albert de Nasse. The family was of modest means, but Suzanne was well educated (largely by her father), becoming fluent in Latin and showing aptitude for mathematics and science. Her first salon was a literary group called the Acad√©mie des Eaux comprising a circle of Lausanne- based students with Curchod as president. In 1757 Curchod met the historian Edward Gibbon, who fell in love with her, writing in a later recollection of their courtship that he \\"found her learned without pedantry, lively in conversation, pure in sentiment, and elegant in manners.\\" He wished to marry her, but paternal disapproval on both sides, Gibbon's own wavering, and Suzanne's refusal to leave Switzerland for England thwarted their plans. Gibbon broke off the engagement in 1762, an event that fell in between the deaths of Curchod's parents in 1760 and 1763. With the loss of income resulting from the death of her father, Curchod and her mother were left very poor, a situation she coped with by giving lessons. After her mother died, she became a companion to a young French widow, Madame de Vermenoux, who took her to Paris around 1763 or 1764. At the time, Madame de Vermenoux was being courted by the ambitious Swiss financier Jacques Necker but was uncertain whether she wanted to remarry at all. Within a few months, however, Necker turned his attention to Curchod, and in 1764 the two were married. They had one child, a daughter named Anne Louise Germaine, the future writer and philosopher now better known as Madame de Sta√´l. Life in Paris In 1776, Madame Necker's husband became Director-General of Finances, head of the French finance ministry under King Louis XVI, a position he gained in spite of the double disadvantage of his Protestant religion and Swiss origins. He owed much of his success to his wife's salon, where the luminaries of Parisian society gathered to discuss art, literature, and politics. Among the regular visitors were Jean-Fran√ßois Marmontel, Jean-Fran√ßois de La Harpe, the Comte de Buffon, the Baron von Grimm, Gabriel Bonnot de Mably, Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Antoine L√©onard Thomas, and the compilers of the Encyclop√©die including Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Madame Necker's salons were also a meeting place for Swiss expatriates such as Marie Th√©r√®se Rodet Geoffrin and Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand. It was at one of Madame Necker's dinners that a group of men of letters first proposed starting a subscription to pay for a statue of Voltaire by the sculptor Jean- Baptiste Pigalle. His statue of a nude Voltaire was finished in 1776 and is now in the Louvre. Madame Necker carried on an extensive correspondence with Grimm, Buffon, Thomas, Marmontel, and others of these men of letters, especially when they were away from Paris. The time commitment involved in running a salon, combined with her husband's dislike of bluestocking authors, prevented Madame Necker from pursuing her interest in writing to the extent she desired. Her surviving writings are few: a memoir about the establishment of hospitals (M√©moire sur l'Etablissement des hospices, 1786) and some reflections on divorce (R√©flexions sur le divorce, 1794). She devoted considerable time to ensuring that their daughter Germaine received the very best education possible. Hospice de Charit√© The French hospital system during the 18th century was not well standardized and overall lacked good patient care. Hospital conditions were unsatisfactory, especially due to overcrowding, as exemplified by the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris. After visiting this hospital, French Encyclopedist Denis Diderot described it this way: :The biggest, roomiest, richest and most terrifying of all hospitals...Imagine every kind of patient, sometimes packed three, four, five, or six into a bed, the living alongside the dead and dying, the air polluted by this mass of sick bodies, passing the pestilential germs of their affections from one to the other, and the spectacle of suffering and agony on every hand. These kinds of harsh conditions prompted discussion of hospital reform among government officials. They called for improvements to the hospital environment and for strategic siting of hospitals to make it easier for families to visit hospital-bound relatives. As finance minister, Jacques Necker was particularly influential in steering the agreed reforms.Risse 1999, p. 296. One of the first of the proposed ‚Äúneighborhood hospitals‚Äù was the Hospice de Charit√©, a small-scale hospital located in a vacated monastery. Responsibility for its development was placed on Madame Necker, and she turned it into a facility with a 120-patient capacity. She enlisted the services of around a dozen Sisters of Charity, the women who traditionally managed the day-to-day tasks and tended to patients in French hospitals. The new hospital began accepting patients in 1778, serving the areas of St. Sulpice and du Gros Caillou in Paris and especially welcoming the poor. Patients had to be residents of the area, and they also had to show proof that they were Catholic, usually by presenting a certificate of baptism and a confession.Risse 1999, p. 290. Madame Necker aimed to improve patient care while maintaining the institution‚Äôs financial efficiency, as detailed in the preface of the hospital‚Äôs first annual report from 1780. She summarized her goals for the Hospice de Charit√© project thus: :To show the possibility of nursing sick people, each one in a bed to himself, with all the care dictated by the kindliest humanity, without exceeding a fixed price. The dedication of Madame Necker and the staff to upholding a standard of good care with limited means was recognized by visitors to the hospital. John Howard, a British hospital reformer who visited in 1786, stated that the hospital was a ‚Äúnoble example of private charity‚Äù.Risse 1999, p. 297. The detailed reports released by the hospital each year further convey Madame Necker's commitment to the project. Not only were illness and patient statistics reported, but also less obvious expenses such as the cost and quantities of food and wine consumed within the hospital. Madame Necker emphasized hygiene, assigning particular importance to good ventilation.Boon 2011, p. 96. The Hospice de Charit√©‚Äôs early mortality rates were somewhat better than at other hospitals, though still high. In 1780, the mortality rate was recorded at 17%, and the next year increased to 21%; by comparison, the overcrowded H√¥tel-Dieu had a mortality rate of nearly 25%. Although some critics felt that the Hospice de Charit√© was not entirely successful in demonstrating the advantages of small hospitals, it proved to be an influential model. With fewer patients to look after and a cleaner environment, physicians were able to study patients more thoroughly and provide them with better care.Risse 1999, p. 303. Madame Necker's hospital model was employed in the development of other such hospitals, including a tiny 6-bed Montpellier hospital for Protestants that was named after her.Boon 2011, p. 95. In 1788, Madame Necker relinquished her authority over the Hospice de Charit√©. In 1792, the hospital was renamed Hospice de l‚ÄôOuest or Western Hospice.Risse 1999, p. 305. Today, it is known as the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital. Health problems Madame Necker experienced a myriad of ailments throughout her life, mostly recorded through her letters to friends. In childhood, she is said to have recovered slowly from illnesses, even suffering deafness for a year after one episode.Boon 2011, p. 91. As an adult, her afflictions included endless spells of coughs, chills, and fevers, as well as vaguely described conditions that are hypothesized to have been mental illnesses.Boon 2011, p. 107. It is thought that Madame Necker‚Äôs own extensive physical and emotional suffering ‚Äî in addition to the suffering she witnessed in childhood as the daughter of the village pastor ‚Äî contributed to her passion to improve Parisian health care.Boon 2011, p. 93. Later years Jacques Necker fell from power in 1789 and was dismissed from the ministry. The following year, the Neckers left Paris and returned to Switzerland. Madame Necker died at Beaulieu Castle in Lausanne in 1794. ReferencesFurther reading * Paul-Gabriel d'Haussonville, Le Salon de Madame Necker, Paris, Calmann-L√©vy, 1882, 2 volumes.

BCCI instituted a commission to examine the charges. Based on lack of evidence, the commission dismissed all allegations. Prabhakar's allegations Manoj Prabhakar made a public allegation against an unknown team member to the magazine Outlook in June 1997. BCCI instituted a one-man investigation commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India ‚Äì Honorable Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Specifically the following games were brought to light by Manoj Prabhakar as part of his allegations: * India vs Pakistan in Sharjah in 1991. Even with fading light, the team management asked Prabhakar and Sanjay Manjrekar to continue playing after the umpires offered light. Pakistan won the match in the last over and qualified for the finals of the trophy. * India vs Pakistan in Colombo (Singer Cup) in 1994. Manoj Prabhakar was offered Rs 2.5 million for sabotaging the match in Pakistan's favour. Manoj claims to have shouted the player out of his room. The match was washed away due to rain. * India vs West Indies in Kanpur in 1994. Nayan Mongia and Manoj Prabhakar scored 11 runs in 48 balls chasing West Indies total. Both the players were dropped for the subsequent match on charges of indiscipline * India vs Pakistan in Sharjah (Date: Unknown). Both the captains Aamir Sohail and Mohammad Azharuddin claimed winning the toss. Commission hearings BCCI wanted the commission to examine the following charges: * Was there any truth in the allegations by Manoj Prabhakar true? * Was any Indian cricketer, official, journalist or any other person involved in betting and match fixing? * Did Ajit Wadekar tap the telephones of Indian cricketers? * Was there any truth in the bribery and match-fixing reports? Justice Chandrachud started his inquiry on 7 July 1997. Manoj Prabhakar, Kapil Dev and Outlook magazine correspondent Krishna Prasad deposed to the judge on the first day. Manoj Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (Match Fixing and Phone Tapping allegation on then Cricket Manager Ajit Wadekar). Other people who appeared in front of the commission: * 22 July 1997: Ajit Wadekar, Ashok Mankad, Dilip Vengsarkar and Sanjay Manjrekar * 5 September 1997: Sachin Tendulkar, Mohammad Azharuddin, Sunil Gavaskar, Nayan Mongia and D.V.Subba Rao (Manager ‚Äì West Indies Tour) * Ajay Jadeja, Chandu Borde, Sandeep Patil, Sunil Dev (Manager ‚Äì India Tour of South Africa), Makarand Waigankar (Journalist) and Dr. Ali Irani (Physiotherapist) * Aniruddha Bahal (Principal Correspondent, Outlook), Lokendra Pratap Sahi (Sports Editor, The Telegraph), Bipin Dani (freelance journalist), SK Sham (Press Correspondent, Reuters), Pradeep Vijaykar (Assistant Editor, The Times of India), Pradeep Magazine (Sports Editor, Pioneer), H Natarajan (Sports Editor, The Indian Express) and R. Mohan (The Hindu) gave written statements to the commission Chandrachud Commission report Justice Chandrachud completed his inquiry in October 1997 and submitted the report on an undisclosed date to BCCI. When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The report concluded: * There was no plausible reason why Manoj Prabhakar had to wait 3 to 6 years to report match-fixing allegations. Manjrekar's statement contradicted Prabhakar's on the events at Sharjah in October 1991. No evidence was provided with respect to the Singer Cup incident nor was a report made to the Captain, Coach or Vice-captain. Manoj's allegation against Aamir Sohail and Mohammad Azharuddin on the toss incident was factually incorrect as there was no match when these 2 cricketers captained their countries in Sharjah. Manoj Prabhakar refused to name the attempted briber in spite of assurances from the judge himself.

The judge had no hesitation in rejecting the allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar. * The judge accepted Ajit Wadekar's statement on the phone- tapping allegation and dismissed the same. * All of these inferences of journalist of match-fixing were not unjustified as the Judge himself believes that large amount of betting took place on cricket in India.

Criticism There was criticism in the Indian media that the commission did not examine all facts available to it. Specific areas of concern for the media was the method of recording evidence, lack of initiative to dig into the disconnect in facts of the Aamir Sohail ‚Äì Mohammad Azharuddin toss, lack of questioning and evidences against people involved in betting and match-fixing, not considering the tapes of interview by Outlook with Rashead Latif (where he named five Indian cricketers involved in match fixing and which he subsequently backed out).

History  It was devised by Mohammed Turay (born ca. 1850), an Islamic scholar, at a town called Maka (Barri Chiefdom, southern Sierra Leone). One of Turay's Quranic students was a young man named Kisimi Kamara. Kamara was the grandson of Turay's sister. Kamara also married Turay's daughter, Mariama. Turay devised a form of writing called 'Mende Abajada' (meaning 'Mende alphabet'), which was inspired in part by the Arabic abjad and in part by the Vai syllabary. Some scholars have also suggested that some of the characters were inspired by certain indigenous Mende pictograms and cryptographic characters that are widely known to the Mende people. Turay's \\"Mende Abajada\\" was adjusted a bit (order of characters) by Kamara and probably corresponds to the first 42 characters of the script, which is an abugida. Kamara developed the script further with help from his brothers, adding more than 150 other syllabic characters. Kamara then popularized the script and gained quite a following as result‚Äîwhich he used to help establish himself as one of the most important chiefs in southern Sierra Leone during his time (he was not a 'simple village tailor' as suggested by some contemporary writers). Kikakui is still used today, but perhaps by less than 500 people. There is also an associated number writing system, which is entirely original (and, like the characters of the script, written from right to left). Characters There were an original 42 syllabic characters that were ordered according to sound and shape, while 150 more characters were later added without the same consistency to the character set. Some of the initial 42 characters resemble an abugida, given the standard ability for a reader to discern the vowels from seeing the character, as indicated by dots in consistent locations, but such uniformity vanishes in the remaining 150 characters. Glyphic variants have been found for certain characters. Additionally, digits are encoded by indicating the place value on each digit for a number, with the units digit alone having no special indication. Beyond the 10s digit, the further digits are written on top of the base place value indicator, which increases in vertical lines from 2 at the 100s place (indicating 2*10 + the digit above) to the millionths digit that is encoded (which has 6). All of the different possible digits are encoded separately. Unicode Mende Kikakui script was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

They currently play in Deutsche Eishockey Liga 2 (DEL2) , the second level of ice hockey in Germany. They were promoted from the third-tier Oberliga in 2019 after winning the Oberliga finals against the Tilburg Trappers. The team was founded in 1948 as Eislaufverein Landshut (EVL), but since 2002 the professional operations have been incorporated as a separate entity. From 2002 to 2013 the professional team was competing as ‚ÄúLandshut Cannibals‚Äù; in 2013 the name was changed back to \\"EVL Landshut Eishockey\\", to more closely reflect the tradition and history of the team. There is close cooperation with the non-for-profit EVL, which is still responsible for non-professional areas, i.e. junior hockey and figure skating. From 1963 to 1994 the Team was a participant in the Ice hockey Bundesliga and is a founder member of the DEL. The team won the West German National Championship in 1970 and 1983.< The home arena of the Landshut Cannibals is the Eisstadion am Gutenbergweg, where they have played since 1957, after leaving tentative other locations. The arena has since been renovated several times, last in 2019, and currently holds 4,139 people.http://www.landshut.de/portal/sport/staedtische-eissportanlage.html Landshut's player development program is counted among the best in Germany, producing numerous well-known hockey players such as ‚ÄúGermany‚Äôs hockey player of the century‚Äù Erich K√ºhnhackl, Gerd Truntschka (All Star at the 1987 World Ice Hockey Championships) and longtime NHL players Marco Sturm (Washington Capitals), Christoph Schubert (Atlanta Thrashers) and double Stanley Cup winner Tom K√ºhnhackl (Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Islanders).  History = The origins of ice hockey in Landshut and promotion to the top division (1934‚Äì1957)  The former ‚ÄúSterngarten‚Äù tavern It was not until 1934 when Landshut-born Heinz Wittmann organised an ice hockey equipment from Garmisch- Partenkirchen. The first games were played under the name of ‚ÄúTeam Brauerei Wittmann‚Äù (named after Wittmann Brewery) against squads from Wartenberg, Bavaria and Donaustauf. On February 1, 1934 the team was incorporated into the Ski-Club Landshut (SCL). The same season they got champions of the Danube region. The 1935‚Äì36 season marked the first appearance in the Kreisliga (then second division), where the squad played the following three years. In 1937 the ice hockey section was transferred from the SCL to another club, the Turngemeinde Landshut (TGL). After the 1938‚Äì39 season a regular schedule of the league was not possible any more because of the outbreak of World War II. During the war there only took place a few friendly games, for example against Straubing on January 10, 1943. From the first post-war season 1945‚Äì46 to 1947-48 the team started in the newly formed Landesliga ‚Äì again as section of the TGL. In 1948 contentions evolved concerning transferring of the earnings from the lucrative hockey games to the club's other sections. As a result of the dispute most of TGL's hockey players formed a new registered association, the ‚ÄúEislaufverein Landshut‚Äù (EVL). The founding ceremony took place on April 25, 1948 in the ‚ÄúSterngarten‚Äù tavern. The driving force behind this move was Georg Zeller, other notable players of the early time were Hans Fr√ºhmorgen, Walter Rauhmeier and Jaro Truntschka. The latter would be eight times best EVL-scorer of the year. The few players who stayed with the TGL formed a squad that broke up in 1951. The newly founded EVL-team however started in the Landesliga, the then second division. In the 1948‚Äì49 season, their first one, the team lost the finals against EV Tegernsee. The following eight seasons were also played in the Landesliga, until the team won the promotion tie 1956‚Äì57 against TEV Miesbach. That game's decisive player was Jaro Truntschka scoring two times. Following this victory the club moved up to the Oberliga, then the top level hockey league in Germany.  From the underdog to the champion of the ice hockey Bundesliga (1957‚Äì1994)  In the run-up to the first season in the Oberliga calls for the construction of an artificial ice rink grew louder, because with only having a natural ice rink the EVL would not be competitive in Germany's highest hockey league. After prolonged negotiations the city favored building an ice rink instead of a public pool, and with joint work the Eisstadion am Gutenbergweg was completed timely for the 1957‚Äì58 season (then without roof). The official inauguration took place on November 10, 1957 against EC Kitzb√ºhel. 5,000 spectators saw a 4‚Äì4 draw. Due to the new rink the EVL played against international teams (e.g. Blau- Weiss Z√ºrich, HC Bozen or HK Partizan Belgrad for the first time. Following the season the German league system was reformed and the EV Landshut was relegated to the second division (then called Oberliga). Forcing the pace of junior hockey player development the team was quite successful in the following years. Placed 1st after the 1961‚Äì62 season the EVL lost the promotion ties against TSC Eintracht Dortmund, but the consecutive season they beat Dortmund and promoted to the ice hockey Bundesliga. Without acquiring new players the Landshut-based team started in their first Bundesliga season 1963-64 as underdog and candidate for relegation. The home games attracted up to 10,000 people. Surprisingly the team reached the fifth place out of eight. 1965 marked the beginnings of a friendly relationship with HC Sparta Praha, e.g. regarding training camps and friendly games. In 1967, ten years after the construction of the ice rink, the stadium was roofed and converted into an arena. That year the EV Landshut signed coach Karel Gut from Sparta Praha for three years. In his first year at the Isar his team was placed third. The following year was rather disappointing: Being placed fourth, the squad had to play relegation. The 1969‚Äì70 season preliminary round, being under pressure to perform, was finished on the first place. As the champions round was also dominated by Landshut, the team won the German championship for the first time. The hockey euphoria in the city was immense, four out of ten home games were sold out. The most decisive players of the season were Alois Schloder, Rudi Hejtmanek and goalie Sepp Schramm. In the 1970-71 European Cup Landshut defeated SG Cortina but was disqualified due to an unlicensed player. The following years the team were runners-up for two times (both 1973-74 and 1975‚Äì76). For years, both Alois Schloder and Erich K√ºhnhackl belonged to the top-five scorers in the Bundesliga. Important task for every coach was the integration of the most talented junior players into the professional team. In a legendary game in the 1974‚Äì75 season the team faced a 0‚Äì10 loss against Krefeld, because there were only six players available (due to a flu epidemic). In the following season two young players joined the team, which would be important in the years to come: Bernhard Englbrecht and Gerd Truntschka. At the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck three EVL-players joined the German national team (Alois Schloder, Erich K√ºhnhackl and Klaus Auhuber), which won bronze behind the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia ‚Äì the greatest victory in German hockey history. After middling results in the 1977‚Äì78 season the management signed Franti≈°ek Posp√≠≈°il. Nevertheless, the team had to play relegation and the attendance dropped from estimated 4,500 to 1,700. Signing Ji≈ô√≠ Kochta for the 1979‚Äì80 season brought luck and the fourth place. In 1980 the coach of the first championship, Karel Gut, returned to Landshut. This season saw the NHL-like playoff system introduced. While the team was eliminated in the 1980-81 quarterfinals, and the 1981-82 semifinals, they knocked out the Mannheimer ERC in the 1982-83 finals and could call themselves German champions for the second time. The major players for Landshut were Bob Laycock, Robin Laycock and Michael Betz (scored the decisive 4-5 goal in the last final). In the 1983‚Äì84 season the EV Landshut only lost the finals against the K√∂lner EC and were runners-up. In the following years the club faced increasing financial troubles as did most Bavarian hockey strongholds. Depts totalled 2.7 mil. D-Mark. This was because Landshut's junior player education was expensive, and the well-educated players would be contracted by wealthy large city-clubs Despite signing a few well-known players like Tom Roulston, Matti Hagman and Tom O'Regan between 1984 and 1989 the club was not able to come through the quarterfinals. The preliminary standings declined from fourth to eighth, before the team missed the playoff qualification in the 1989-90 preliminaries. The relegation round was finished on the first rank. The 1990-91 preliminaries were also completed only on the ninth rank, but in the playdowns the EVL knocked out the EHC Dynamo Berlin. In the following season the squad finally hit rock bottom: Losing all relegation games, the EVL owed its participation in the Bundesliga the baize table (two contrahents resigned). After managing the 1992-93 relegation round, Landshut's management decided to invest in a punchy lineup to play for the championship, but was knocked out in the quarterfinals.  The founding of the DEL and the sale of the license (1994‚Äì2000)  Due to the desolate financial situation in German professional ice hockey, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga was founded in 1994. It was the first self-managed German professional league. All teams of the Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga were outsourcing their professional operations into corporations. The EV Landshut's team was transferred to the Cannibals Eissport GmbH and because of marketing purposes the professional team was known under ‚ÄúLandshut Cannibals‚Äù since then. Marco Sturm playing for the Boston Bruins In the 1994-95 DEL season ‚Äì the first ever ‚Äì coach Bernie Johnston was able to keep most of last year's squad and strengthened it with signing NHL-star Wallace Schreiber. Furthermore, benefited the team from the 1994‚Äì95 NHL lockout more than most other DEL franchises, with Pavel Bure, Scott Young and Uwe Krupp playing shortly for the Cannibals. Bure's only game for Landshut was legendary, scoring three times against the Eisb√§ren Berlin. Ranked second after the preliminaries, the Cannibals knocked out the Lausitzer F√ºchse in the round of sixteen, before defeating both Kassel Huskies and Krefeld Pinguine. In the finals they were only beaten by the K√∂lner Haie. Wallace Schreiber and Mike Bullard were top-scorers of the league with 38 and 39 goals resp. The following season the Cannibals had landed Jos√© Charbonneau (top-scorer with 42 goals), while Marco Sturm entered professional level and scored 12 times. In the 1995-96 playoff season they defeated the Starbulls Rosenheim in the first round and swept the Adler Mannheim, setting up another showdown with the K√∂lner Haie, which was lost. In the 1996-97 playoffs they played K√∂ln for the third time in a row, this time knocking them out in the quarterfinal round, before losing to Mannheim in the semifinals. Best scorer was Gino Cavallini with 28 goals. The team of following season's top-scorer, Dave McLlwain, swept ‚Äúfavorite opponent‚Äù K√∂lner Haie, but lost to the Eisb√§ren Berlin in the semifinals. For the 1998-99 DEL season the Cannibals management envisaged proceeding to the final round for the first time in the last four years. After signing Chris Valentine as coach they contracted former NHL players Dean Evason, Jason Herter, David Bruce, Mike Casselman, Peter Douris and Bob Joyce as well as Evan Marble and Jari Korpisalo. Ranked sixth after the preliminary round the squad was knocked out surprisingly in the quarterfinals by the Adler Mannheim. The disappointment of the early elimination gave way to consternation regarding the club's financial situation. With depths totaling 10 mil. D-Mark (about 6.5 mil. USD) the club management announced on May 12, 1999 they would not be able to run a team for the 1999/2000 DEL season. The corporation Cannibals Eissport GmbH (i.e. the franchise) was sold to the Anschutz Entertainment Group, renamed ‚ÄúMEC M√ºnchener Eishockey Club GmbH‚Äù (Munich ice hockey club Gmbh) and relocated to Munich, where the franchise played for three seasons as Munich Barons. In 2002 the franchise was relocated to Hamburg and started operation as Hamburg Freezers. A cooperation contract ruled out that the EV Landshut had to stay two levels below the Barons for at least three years, therefore earning 350,000 D-Mark for junior hockey development p.a. As a result, ice hockey in Landshut had to continue in the third level semi-professional Oberliga after 36 seasons of top-level participation.  The new beginning in the third division (2000‚Äì2003)  Christoph Schubert playing for the Atlanta Trashers With canceling top-level professional ice hockey in Landshut most of the squad left the team and continued their careers with the Munich Barons or other clubs of the DEL. At first it was Michael Eibl who the team, that consisted mainly of young players out of the club's junior teams (e.g. Markus Hundhammer and Christoph Schubert) but also foreign players like Kamil ≈§oupal from HC ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. Later the management signed Gary Clark as coach. On the sixth rank after the preliminaries the squad knocked out the Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg and the TSV Erding and were qualified for playing the 2000/01 2nd Bundesliga season but had to resign due to the cooperation contract with the Munich Barons. After completing the 2000/01 Oberliga preliminaries on rank six the team was swept by the F√ºchse Duisburg in the playoff quarterfinal round. That season saw later general manager Bernd Truntschka return as a player due to player shortage. The average audience dropped to 1,300 ‚Äì a record low in the younger history of the club. The following season the management signed coach Bernhard Englbrecht and tried to struggle for promotion. Due to ongoing financial troubles ‚Äì a legacy of the DEL-era ‚Äì the club filed for bankruptcy, while the team still was playing the preliminaries. They were placed first finishing 14 points better than the second-place ESV Kaufbeuren. Finally the squad swept Erding in the semifinals and the Dresdner Eisl√∂wen in the finals. Consequently, the EV Landshut promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga.  Landshut Cannibals in the 2nd Bundesliga (since 2003)  Upon re-entering the professional league system, the professional operation of the EV Landshut was outsourced again. Since 2002 the team has been organised as the Landshuter Eishockey Spielbetriebs-GmbH and is known as the Landshut Cannibals. Bernd Truntschka was appointed general manager. In October 2002 the insolvency plan was approved and the following year the last debt payment was made. The 2002-03 2nd Bundesliga preliminaries saw a surprising finish on the fourth rank. In the playoffs the squad knocked out the Heilbronner Falken but was defeated by SC Riessersee in the playoff semifinals. Christian Brittig was the top scorer with 20 goals. The Cannibals' second season in the league was even more successful: They beat the EV Duisburg, before defeating EC Bad Nauheim in the fifth and last game 3-2 SO. After losing the finals to Wolfsburg in four games Landshut were runners-up. 2,622 spectators per game watched this spectacular season, and with the insolvency proceedings completed, the EVL was debt-free. Stefan Horneber and T. J. Guidarelli in the Cannibals dress In the 2004-05 preliminaries the team qualified for the playoffs. In the quarterfinals they were knocked out by derby opponent EV Regensburg. The following season the club signed among others Daniel Naud as coach and goalie Martin Cinibulk. The powerful squad was ranked second in the first round. Understandably management, players and fans were heavily disappointed as the team was defeated by underdog Dresdner Eisl√∂wen in seven games. Strangely enough the EVL celebrated walkovers in the home games (7-1, 7‚Äì1, 4-1), while losing narrowly away. The team lost the final game in Landshut 4‚Äì1. In the 2006‚Äì07 season the Cannibals knocked out the Schwenninger Wild Wings, but were swept by Wolfsburg in the semifinals. In the 2007-08 pre-season coach Andreas Brockmann formed a powerful team consisting of Brent Walton, Brandon Dietrich, and Peter Abstreiter and kept most of the regulars. The second placing in the preliminaries got fans and team in the right mood for a successful playoff season. In the quarterfinals the team defeated the Bietigheim Steelers 4‚Äì1, and swept Heilbronn in the semifinals. The Cannibals entered a 2nd Bundesliga final round for the second time since 2004. Although the team's opponent, the Kassel Huskies, had a budget twice the amount of Landshut's, the finals were close. Winning the first game 1‚Äì0 in Kassel, the team lost the following two encounters (0-6 and 0-5). In the fourth game the Cannibals cleared 5-4 OT. The final game was not finished until Drew Bannister shot Kassel to the championship and promotion to the DEL in overtime. In the 2008‚Äì09 season the financial background was not that bright, so that the fifth rank after the preliminaries was a good result. Ben Cottreau (top-scorer with 59 points) was a lucky pull, and Tom K√ºhnhackl made his debut in professional hockey. Unfortunately the team was defeated in the quarterfinals by EV Ravensburg in six games. The 2009-10 preliminaries were finished on the fifth rank again. Even young forwards Tom K√ºhnhackl and Tobias Rieder, who left for Canada after that season, could not prevent a loss against Bietigheim in the playoff quarterfinals.

Overview The Boosh were signed by the BBC soon after the success of Autoboosh and in October 2001 The Boosh, produced by Danny Wallace, was first broadcast on BBC London Live, then BBC Radio 4, and later BBC 7. This six-part series won the Douglas Adams Award for innovative comedy writing. The set is available from the BBC on audio CD, titled The Mighty Boosh. According to the interview track included in the set, Julian Barratt did the primary editing for the radio show. The plots to all the episodes were reworked extensively and reused in the first TV series. The Mighty Boosh returned to radio on 22 October 2004, when they did a comedy special for The Breezeblock, a show on BBC Radio 1. Instead of the plot driven nature of the series, this show featured improvised conversational comedy with Barratt, Fielding and Fulcher, combined with the show's usual mix of electronic music.

She was a co-founder of the Liberal Party of Australia. Biography She was born Elizabeth May Ramsay Tannock, the daughter of Elizabeth Mary (n√©e Ramsay), and Archibald Tannock. Her father was a confectioner. She was born and grew up in Geelong, and was educated to matriculation level at the Girls' High School. She matriculated in 1895. After a period of teaching at the Methodist Ladies' College and Tintern Grammar, another independent girls' school, she moved to Perth, Australia in 1916 to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Western Australia.Biography, womenaustralia.info; accessed 23 July 2017. In 1917, aged 41, she married businessman Claude Couchman, but they had no children. He died ten years later. On his death she decided to devote the rest of her life to the pursuit of public interests, which included voluntary work and the duties of a Justice of the Peace. From 1927 to 1945, she was president of the Australian Women's National League, a conservative women's organisation established in 1904 to support the monarchy and empire, combat socialism, educate women in politics, and safeguard the interests of the home, women and children. Between the world wars, the League claimed 40,000 members and was the largest continuous non-labour organisation, but those numbers had dwindled to approximately 12,000 by 1944. In 1945, it merged to help form the new Liberal Party of Australia. Couchman insisted on equal representation of women and men at all levels of the Victorian division, and was involved in establishing the branch structure of the party. She worked in the Liberal Party organisation as a member of the state executive and state council, and served as Victorian vice-president of the party from 1949‚Äì55. She was the first female to be appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, from 1932 to 1940, and was a member of the Australian delegation to the League of Nations in 1934. She sought pre-selection for the Senate on three occasions, but was unsuccessful. She eventually gained pre-selection for the safe Labor seat of Melbourne in the 1943 election, but was defeated. Dame Elizabeth Couchman died in Melbourne, aged 106. Honours and recognition She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Years Day Honours and promoted to Dame Commander in the 1961 New Years Day Honours for her public and patriotic services. Couchman Crescent, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm, is named in her honour.

It is an anamorph of the fungus Hypocrea jecorina. T. reesei can secrete large amounts of cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases and hemicellulases). Microbial cellulases have industrial application in the conversion of cellulose, a major component of plant biomass, into glucose. T. reesei isolate QM6a was originally isolated from the Solomon Islands during World War II because of its degradation of canvas and garments of the US army. All strains currently used in biotechnology and basic research were derived from this isolate. Recent advances in the biochemistry of cellulase enzymology, the mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis (cellulolysis), strain improvement, molecular cloning and process engineering are bringing T. reesei cellulases closer to being a commercially viable route to cellulose hydrolysis. Several industrially useful strains have been developed and characterised, e.g. Rut-C30, RL-P37 and MCG-80. The genome was released in 2008. T. reesei has a mating type-dependent characterised sexual cycle. Sexual development T. reesei QM6a has a MAT1-2 mating type locus. The opposite mating type, MAT1-1, was recently found, proving that T. reesei is a heterothallic species. After being regarded as asexual since its discovery more than 50 years ago, sexual reproduction can now be induced in T. reesei QM6a leading to formation of fertilized stromata and mature ascospores. Use in industry T. reesei is an important commercial and industrial micro- organism due to its cellulase production ability. Many strains of T. reesei have been developed since its discovery, with heavy emphasis on increasing cellulase production. These improvement programs originally consisted of classical (ionising-radiation-based and chemical-based) mutagenesis, which led to strains capable of producing 20 times as much cellulase as QM6a. The ultimate aim in the creation of hypercellulolytic strains was to obtain a carbon catabolite derepressed strain. This derepression would allow the T. reesei strain to produce cellulases under any set of growth conditions, even in the presence of glucose. However, with the advent of modern genetic engineering tools such as targeted deletion, targeted knockout, and more, a new generation of strains dubbed \\"hyperproducers\\" has emerged. Some of the highest performing industrial strains produce up to 100 grams of cellulases per litre, more than 3 times as much as the RUT-C30 strain (which itself produces twice as much as the parent strain NG14 from which it was derived). T. reesei is used in the creation of stonewashed jeans. The cellulase produced by the fungus partially degrades the cotton material in places, making it soft and causing the jeans to look as if they had been washed using stones.Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month  See also  *Cellobiohydrolase (CBH) *Cellulosic ethanol *Endoglucanase (EG) ReferencesExternal links * Risk Assessment Summary, CEPA 1999.

The building was a small outpost build to help to suppress the activities of the rapparees and eventually abandoned in 1750. Forkill rectory was built in 1775 in the townland of Shanroe nearer the village of Mullaghbane. This meant that the rector had to travel almost two miles from his home to his church in Forkhill on foot or on horseback. The outbreak of sectarian violence between the Peep o' Day Boys and the Catholic Defenders in the Mulllaghbane and Forkill areas in the 1780s and early 1790s meant that a new barracks was required to house a company of foot soldiers. Belmont Barracks was later built overlooking the site of the rectory in 1795. The Forkhill Yeomanry was formed when the barracks was opened. By 1821 Belmont Barracks had become obsolete and was sold. The main barracks building remains is currently two private homes.https://barracks18c.ucd.ie/shanroe/ The rectory ceased to be occupied by 1920 and was burned by the local IRA in 1922 before it was to be taken over by British forces.

His first major show appearance was as part of WCCW's 1987 \\"Labor Day Star Wars\\" show on September 7, 1987 where he defeated Vic Steamboat. A few months later, at WCCW's 1987 Christmas Star Wars he lost to The Missing Link. He later wrestled at the 5th Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions as well as WCCW's 5th Cotton Bowl extravaganza. Following his stint in WCCW Apollo returned to ICW where he was teamed up with Eric Sbraccia to form a tag team known as the Dynamic Duo, a name taken in tribute to the WCCW team of the same name that was made up of Gentleman Chris Adams and Gino Hernandez. On March 5, 1989 the Dynamic Duo defeated the S & S Express (Vic Steamboat and Joe Savoldi) to win the ICW Tag Team Championship Their first run with the championship lasted 118 days until the S & S Express regained the championship. The Dynamic Duo would briefly hold the tag team championship again in December 1989 as they defeated the Undertakers (Henchman and Punisher) on December 28, then lost the titles to The Lethal Weapons (Dennis Condrey and Doug Gilbert) only two days later. During the early 1990s, Apollo competed as a preliminary wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) most notably facing Adam Bomb with manager Johnny Polo in their debut on Monday Night Raw in 1993.

A survey of 1000 K through 8 principals by the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) dated March 29, 2007 indicated that 94% of them relied upon fundraisers to supplement school income. Thus, due to the rising costs of education, Jog-A-Thons have become one fundraising method that can be used by both public and private schools. Rules During a Jog-A-Thon, participants jog as many laps as they can within a specified time period, usually less than an hour. The course that is jogged (or walked) can be designed in such a way as to take into account the grade level and the ability of the participants running during the specified time period, but everyone has fun. Sponsorship The goal for each Jog-A-Thon participant is to earn as much money as possible from as many sponsors as possible. A sponsor can pledge money based either upon number of laps completed by the participant or by a fixed dollar amount that is irrespective of number of completed laps. Issues Some of the issues with Jog-A-Thons that can cause difficulty are tracking participant laps, billing sponsors that pledged to contribute based upon the number of laps a participant runs, and general tracking and management of the effort.

Two pigment spots between the fourth and fifth ridges are regarded as eyes. The Desmoscolecida move by looping their bodies like geometrid caterpillars or leeches, as well as by creeping on their setae. The mouth is terminal, and leads into a muscular oesophagus which opens into a straight intestine terminating in an anus, which is said to be dorsal in position. The sexes are distinct. The testis is single, and its duct opens into the intestine and is provided with two chitinous spicules. The ovary is also single, opening independently and anterior to the anus.

He served as a Minister in the government of Clement Attlee and ended his career as a Senator of the College of Justice. Johnston took the legal title Lord Johnston. Education Johnston's father Joseph was also an Advocate; he was born in Aberdeen and educated at Aberdeen Grammar School. He then went on to St John's College, Oxford followed by the University of Edinburgh at both of which he studied law. He was called to the Bar in England by the Inner Temple in 1931, and to the Scottish Bar in 1932. Career On 4 April 1936 Johnston married Doris Isobel Kidd, the daughter of James Kidd who was Conservative Member of Parliament for Linlithgowshire from 1918 to 1928. They had two sons and two daughters. During the Second World War he served in the army; on his return he was promoted to be an Advocate Depute, a crown prosecutor, in 1945. He was made a Scottish King's Counsel in October 1947. Political career Johnston had become a supporter of the Labour Party and on 29 October 1947 he was appointed as Solicitor General for Scotland, a government position. He was not then a Member of Parliament but when the constituency of Paisley was vacated by Viscount Corvedale on inheriting his father's Earldom, Johnston was selected to follow him as Labour candidate on 8 January 1948. In the ensuing by-election he faced a straight fight with J.M. MacCormick, a Glasgow solicitor who had been a prominent Scottish Nationalist and was adopted as candidate both by the Conservatives and Liberals. Johnston won by 6,545 votes. Johnston retained his government post until Labour went out of office in 1951. He then became an opposition front-bencher. In May 1954 he moved the rejection of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill on the grounds that it burdened the community with the cost of compensating landowners for the loss of land value. He was not a prominent figure, concentrating on the details of policy. In the meantime he kept up his practice at the Scottish Bar, often appearing at public inquiries. Judicial post In January 1961, Johnston was named as a Senator of the College of Justice, a judicial post, an appointment which vacated his Parliamentary seat. He took the judicial title of Lord Johnston. In December 1963 he found that the national joint council responsible for setting teachers' salaries had not been properly constituted, and awarded the schoolteachers who had brought the case their expenses. He was appointed as Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland in 1965. After the conviction of three Glasgow youths who had killed a man in a street fight in 1977, Johnston decided to defer the sentencing for 12 months. This action was criticised by the Scottish Police Federation. Johnston retired in 1978. Sources *M. Stenton and S.

Slide Keepers  Fastening Device, known as a slide keeper, adopted by U.S. Army with M-1956 Individual Load Carrying Equipment Slide keepers were used to attach the various pouches of the M-1956 equipment to the pistol belt.Headquarters, Department of the Army, FM 21-15 Care and Use of Individual Clothing and Equipment, Washington, D.C., USGPO, 1977, pp. 132-133 Slide keepers were formed of steel strip, the two main parts being a U shaped part and a sliding straight part. When closed the keeper formed a rectangle that tightly held equipment to the pistol belt. \\\\- Fastening Device, Harold S. Van Buren Jr., Feb. 18, 1958 Holding equipment close to the belt reduced bouncing that occurred with M-1910 double hook attached equipment and allowed pouches to be mounted in places where there were no eyelets (such as the suspenders). All M-1956 equipment and that of the subsequent M1967 MLCE and ALICE systems incorporated slide keepers. Slide keepers are now colloquially called alice clips.  Small Arms Ammunition Case  In 1956 the US Army employed several types of cartridge belts for soldiers armed with the M1 Garand, BAR belts for those armed with the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, 3- and 5-cell pockets for those armed with sub-machine guns, a pocket for 15 round M1 Carbine and M2 magazines, and two different pockets for the 30 round magazines, in addition to 2- and 3-cell grenade pouches. The M-1956 Small Arms Ammunition case sought to replace all of these with a pair of simple pouches capable of holding either a 6-pocket M1 bandoleer of M1 Garand en bloc clips (8-rounds each; total of 48 rounds), 8 x M1 Garand en bloc clips (8 rounds each; total of 64 rounds), 2 x BAR magazines (20-rounds), 4 x M1 or M2 carbine magazines (30-round), 3 x 40mm M79 grenades, or 2 x M26 hand grenades plus 2 x hand grenades fastened on the sides of the case. The equipment came at a time when the M14 Rifle was being tested, and the ammunition pouch was thus also designed to hold 2 x M14 magazines (20-rounds each). It was also later found to be capable of only holding 3 M16 magazines (20-rounds each) despite the significant size difference between the magazines. A pouch with dimensions better suited to the 20-round M16 magazines was later produced (See Modifications paragraph below). The cases were issued in pairs and worn at the front of the belt on either side of the buckle. Like all other M-1956 equipment they were constructed of heavy canvas. The top flap was closed by means of a metal eyelet and cloth tab closure. Early models featured a steel plate at the front both to maintain rigidity and to protect the ammunition. Two hand grenades of any type in the US arsenal could be attached on either side of each pouch, with the spoon hooked through a web strap and another web strap with snap-closure wrapped around the top. Like other pouches in the system, the ammunition pouches each attached to the web belt with a pair of slide keepers and, uniquely, an adjustable length strap with a closable hook which connected to the rectangular hook on the suspenders, intended to keep the case upright and transfer some of the weight directly to the shoulders.  Canteen Cover  With the adoption of the M-1956 equipment, the M-1910 1-quart aluminum canteen and later World War II- production of the M-1910 canteen were made with Corrosive Resistant Steel (Aluminum canteens were still made alongside CRS canteen) remained in service well into the 1960s, later replaced by a plastic variant introduced in 1962. Both were of similar dimensions and slightly curved to sit comfortably on the hip. As a result, the M-1956 canteen cover was not fundamentally different from the earlier models with the exception of the use of two slide keepers in lieu of the M-1910 double hook and metal snaps for closure instead of lift- the-dot fasteners. Constructed of cotton duck FM 21-15, 1966, p. 48 with taped edges, the M-1956 canteen cover had a synthetic wool felt lining for insulation and was slightly oversized to accommodate both the canteen and the canteen cup. Covers produced after 1966 have nylon-taped edges. Typically canteen covers also demonstrate the most visible signs of age, fading easily due to continuous wetting and drying. Originally a single canteen and cover was issued and worn either on the belt between the Small Arms Ammunition Case at the front and the Field Pack (see below) at the rear, or mounted on the side of the Field Pack. Troops in Vietnam generally carried two or more canteens, and this practice largely continued after the war, as, with the adoption of larger complementary rucksacks (see Complementary Equipment below), the Intrenching Tool Carrier (see below) often migrated to attachment points on the rucksack, freeing space on the pistol belt for another canteen.  First Aid Case  The M-1956 First Aid CaseFM 21-15, 1966, p. 48FM 21-15, 1977, p. 130 served the same function as the earlier M-1942 First Aid Packet or Lensatic Compass Case. The cotton duck M-1956 case featured a simple flap closure fastened by a blackened \\"glove-type\\" snap. A single slide keeper was mounted on webbing sewn to the back of the case, and later production incorporated an eyelet at the bottom of the pouch for water drainage. Each soldier was issued one first aid case for carrying a field dressing, and those whose duties required them to carry a lensatic compass would have a second first aid case for that purpose. Placement varied with unit standards, but the first aid case was usually mounted in one of three places - on one of the suspender shoulder pad web keepers (often mounted with the opening downward, for quick access), on the pistol belt between the buckle and ammunition case, or on the grenade mounting webbing on the side of one of the ammunition cases.  Intrenching Tool Carrier  The M-1956 intrenching tool carrierFM 21-15, 1966, p. 47 was constructed primarily of olive drab cotton duck and similar in shape to the earlier M-1943 carrier, reflecting the shape of the blade of the intrenching tool and incorporating an opening at the bottom for the handle of the tool. Leather reinforcement protected the duck from the edges of the tool blade. The rounded, webbing-reinforced flap lid of the carrier was fastened closed by means of a round spring socket-and-stud snap fastener rather than the Lift-the-DOT or One-Way-Lift type fasteners used on the M-1943 carrier. Another distinct feature was provision for mounting a bayonet scabbard on the carrier. The scabbard mountings were sewn to the front of the carrier at an angle and consisted of a cotton duck rectangle carrying two eyelets to receive an M-1910 double hook, a leather reinforcement sewn partially underneath the duck rectangle, and a snap fastened strap to hold the scabbard against the front of the carrier. Two slide keepers, for attaching the carrier to the pistol belt, were mounted on webbing sewn to the back of the carrier. The carrier was located on the wearer's left side of the pistol belt next to the field pack,FM 21-15, 1966, pp. 52, 58, 60, 94 although it was alternatively mounted in other locations or on other equipment depending on mission requirements.  Field Pack  The field pack was sized to hold rations such as a Meal, Combat, Individual (C-Ration) along with sparse personal implements, for example shaving kit and extra socks.FM 21-15, 1966, pp. 45-46 The field pack's placement at the rear of the pistol belt led to it being referred to colloquially as the \\"butt pack.\\" The M-1956 pattern field pack featured two flaps, on the left and right inside, to cover the contents of the pack, and an approximately square top cover flap. This design was changed in the M-1961 field pack (see Modifications). Common features of both include cotton duck construction, slide keepers for attachment to the pistol belt, and a pair of eyelets at the top of the pack for attaching the suspenders. Both also included a web handle at the top, webbing on the side of the container to facilitate mounting of accoutrements with slide keepers, eyelets near one edge of the top cover to receive M-1910 double hooks, and a pair of web straps at the bottom of the pack for attaching items like the poncho and poncho liner. Both also featured a card holder with a plastic window at the top of the cover flap.FM 21-15, 1966, p. 52  Sleeping Bag Straps  An H-shaped arrangement of web straps just short of an inch in width was issued to secure the bed roll on the back above the Field Pack. At the \\"H\\" intersection were a pair of friction buckles, and the straps would go around the roll and be attached at these buckles. The other end of the straps were designed to be looped under the web strap on the padded portion of the suspenders, through the metal ring at the front of the suspenders and fastened back onto themselves by lift-the- dot fasteners on the straps. This arrangement effectively made use of the empty upper back area to carry the sleeping bag, but the weight of the bed roll and field pack had a tendency to pull the pistol belt up to the soldier's chest at the front. The sleeping bag straps fell out of use with the adoption of larger rucksacks (see Complementary Equipment below) and were not widely used in Vietnam given the lack of need for a sleeping bag in the tropical climate there. They were used prior to the introduction of rucksacks to carry a bedroll with a poncho, poncho liner, and air mattress. They were occasionally used to carry a bumble of four to six M72 LAW antitank rockets.  Modifications  New weapons and field experience led to a few minor changes in the basic M-1956 equipment during the 1960s. In 1961 an experimental quick release pistol belt was introduced (known as the Davis belt). It was almost identical to the previous model but had a stamped metal buckle in which a bent tab fit through a slot, and remained closed through friction. It was brought into limited service, but never replaced the previous belt by any means. In 1961 some minor changes were made to the Field Pack to make it more practical for field use. The resulting M1961 Field Pack was essentially similar to the M-1956 model, but had an expandable flap lid instead of the flat flap lid, and it had longer poncho straps. It also added a long internal rubber-coated collar to the pack's opening, instead of the two inside duck flaps, in an attempt to better keep the contents dry. In 1964, a 2nd Pattern of the Small Arms Ammunition Case were introduced that was missing the plastic stiffener in front. This allowed the case to carry three M14 magazines side-by-side rather than two. In 1965, slightly modified Small Arms Ammunition Cases came into service to coincide with the adoption of the 5.56√ó45mm NATO M16 rifle. Four of the 20-round magazines fit snugly into the M-1956-pattern cases, but their shorter size meant a void space at the top of the case which was too small to be useful for anything else. As a result, cases were produced in 1965 and 1966, identical to the M-1956 patterns but slightly shorter. By this point the M16 had been accepted for general issue, replacing the M14s as well as M1 Garands, M1/M2 Carbines, M1918 BARs, and SMGs still in service, so the general purpose nature of these cases was no longer essential. These cases did not necessarily fully replace the M-1956 pattern but were issued alongside them. Complementary Equipment Other elements of individual equipment, while not part of the M-1956 system, were often used in conjunction. These include: *Bayonets - M1942, M4, M5, M6, or M7, or M9 *Intrenching Tool *Packboard - A molded plywood frame with canvas back pad, shoulder straps and lashing cord. *M1951 Mountain Rucksack - A cotton duck and leather pack with aluminum frame for extended loads. *M1952 Rucksack - Cotton duck pack with steel frame. *Lightweight Rucksack - A nylon pack with frame replacing the M1952 Rucksack in 1963. *Tropical Rucksack - A similar but larger pack, augmenting and replacing some Lightweight Rucksacks in 1967. *ARVN Rucksack - A canvas pack used by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and some US troops during the Vietnam War. *PRC-25 Radio Carrier - A canvas back- mounted carrier with integral metal frame and straps for carrying manpack radios. *Radio Accessory Case - A roughly rectangular canvas bag with slide keepers, for spare antenna and handset. *XM3 Bipod Carrying Case - A rectangular canvas pouch with slide keepers about one and a half feet long with top closure. *Small Arms Accessory Case - Rubberized nylon pouch about 6 by 3 inches, for cleaning accessories. *M1916 Holster - A black (at this time) leather holster with wire hanger, for the M1911A1 .45 caliber pistol. *M1912/M1918/M1923 Pistol Magazine Pocket - Two-cell pocket for 7-round .45 pistol magazine, attached by web belt loop. Produced in drab, light Olive Drab shade 3, and Olive Drab shade 7. *P1956 Pistol Magazine Pocket - Neary identical to the M1923 in Olive Drab shade 7, but with two metal slide keepers on the reverse for attachment to a belt.  United States Military Use  The M-1956 Load-Bearing Equipment was originally adopted for use exclusively by the United States Army while the other services retained various combination of M1910-M1945 style equipment, and the Marine Corps developed its own 1961 pattern. During the Vietnam War however the Army's M-1956 and M1961 improvements came into use across the services and remained in widespread service with various independent components of the M1967 MLCE until being replaced by the All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE), of a more practical nylon construction, officially beginning in 1974. Elements of M-1956 gear could still be found used in conjunction with ALICE gear as late as the 1990s, especially the Field Pack, for which ALICE offered no replacement, and the suspenders which some regard as more comfortable than those of the ALICE system.  Foreign Use  Foreign use of the M-1956 equipment could (and can still) be found in nations to which the United States provided military assistance during its period of use, including the armies of the Republic of Vietnam (formerly), Khmer Republic (formerly), Kingdom of Laos (formerly), Republic of Korea (still actively), certain US-sponsored Latin American organizations, among many others.  Performance and Replacement  The M-1956 LCE effectively equipped the United States Army during a period of changing weapons, and proved effective in its ability to be tailored to different missions and operational priorities. Its influence can be seen in the M1967 MLCE and ALICE equipment which replaced it. The primary downfall of the M-1956 equipment which led to its ultimate replacement was its canvas construction, which made it less durable, more absorbent, and heavier than nylon equipment.

The Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque (), also referred to as the Blue Mosque, is a Sunni Muslim mosque located in downtown Beirut, Lebanon. In the 19th century, a Zawiya (prayer corner) was built on this site. Decades of preparation to obtain sufficient land adjacent to the old Zawiya led finally to the building of the new mosque. It was inaugurated in 2008.  Construction  The Mohammad Al-Amin mosque is the biggest mosque in Lebanon. In the initial steps of building this mosque, Hariri endured many obstacles such as rights of property and funding the actual building. In preparation for the mosque, panels were placed which signified that a mosque was going to be built. Soon after the Lebanon Civil War, very little was left. Following a donation by late Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, the foundation stone for the Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque was laid in November 2002. The design is evocative of the Ottomans‚Äô monumental architecture: with a built area covering approximately 11,000 square meters, a 48-meter-high blue dome and 65-meter-high minarets (placed on the corners of the mosque), the mosque has become a dominant feature of the Beirut City Center skyline. It was inaugurated in 2008. The Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque contains multiple domes. All of the domes of the mosque are made from light blue tiles. The mosque also has multiple arches, which are couple stories high. The mosque has very similar characteristics to the Sultan Ahmed Mosque. In commencement of the mosque, Hariri commissioned Oger Liban. Hariri also hired Azmi Fakhuri as the main architect for the mosque. After the first stone was laid out for the mosque, the first concrete was poured in 2003. By 2005, the architecture of the mosque began to be built. The main stone used for the mosque was the Yellow Riyadh Stone. While he had other architects and artists to make this mosque, Rafic Hariri was very involved in the making of the building's exterior decor.  Timeline  19th century: A Zawiya (prayer corner) was built on the site of what is today the Al-Amin Mosque, and named after Sheikh Abu Nasr Al-Yafi. 1950: Mohammad Al-Amin Association was created to replace the Zawiya with a mosque. 1975: Souk Abu Nasr and the Zawiya stop operating, following outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War. November 2002: Foundation stone of the new mosque was laid after a donation by late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. 2008: Inauguration of the mosque. 2020: The mosque suffers severe damage in the 2020 Beirut explosions.  History  In the 19th century, a Zawiya (prayer corner) named after Sheikh Abu Nasr al-Yafi was built on this site. Souk Abu Nasr was located in the same area and was operational, with the Zawiya, until 1975. Following earlier efforts by Beiruti families, the Mohammad Al-Amin Association was created in the 1950s in order to replace the Zawiya with a mosque, in the name of the Prophet Mohammad, and acquire more land. The project never materialized. It took decades of preparation to obtain sufficient land adjacent to the old Zawiya to build the new mosque.

Hunter has won new levels of government awards, private grants and philanthropic contributions and launched the first capital campaign in its history. Raab has been credited with transforming Hunter College from an open-admissions institution to a selective, highly ranked college with a highly diverse student population that comprises one of America's largest cohorts of immigrant and first generation students, including the most selective Macaulay Honors program in the City University system. Since she assumed the presidency, Hunter has significantly increased its grants and awards, and modernized and strengthened its fiscal management. Pres. Raab has been responsible for securing an unprecedented $335 million in private philanthropic support for the college, the most successful fundraising in Hunter history, including a record $25 million gift by Toby and Leon G. Cooperman in 2013. Other notable gifts during her tenure have been a $10 million from the Caravan Institute, the parent organization of Parliamo Italiano, to continue the legacy of the school, and $15 million from Klara and Larry Silverstein, president and chief executive of Silverstein Properties. The gift will fund the Klara and Larry Silverstein student success center on the seventh floor of Hunter's library and the renovation of the Hunter College Auditorium, which will serve as the New York Philharmonic's temporary home for three years.Cooper, Michael and Pogrebin, Robin (25 October 2015). \\"New York Philharmonic Discusses Temporary Home at Hunter College\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 3 August 2016. Other major changes include the renovation and reopening of the historic Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt House, which is now the Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, and the construction of a $131 million home on Third Avenue and East 119 Street in East Harlem for Hunter's renowned Silberman School of Social Work that also housed the new CUNY School of Public Health. The CUNY School of Public Health has since moved to another building. During Raab's tenure as president [see external links below for articles on the controversy surrounding her appointment], Hunter College was included in The Princeton Review (2013) Best 378 Colleges and The Best 378 Colleges: 2014 Edition. Hunter ranked #1 in the category \\"Lots of Race/Class Interaction.\\" Hunter College was also included in The Princeton Review's 2012 Best 376 Colleges. Hunter was ranked among The Princeton Review's Top 10 \\"Best Value\\" public colleges in the nation in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Hunter College was also ranked as #7 among Top Public Schools of North Regional Universities as well as #34 among Best Regional Universities in the North (public and private) in the U.S. News & World Report 2012 Best Colleges rankings, moving up 18 positions in four years. Under Raab's leadership as president, Hunter College's Roosevelt House underwent a $24.5 million renovation, completed in 2010, and which is now the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute. Roosevelt House, a landmarked double-townhouse on East 65th Street on Manhattan's Upper East Side, was the historic New York City home of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt. After Sara's death in 1942, President Roosevelt was pleased to sell the House to Hunter College for use as a student center. An integral part of the College since 1943, the house has undergone an extensive renovation and re-opened in spring 2010 as the home of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College. The transformation of Roosevelt House into a state-of-the-art facility for the College provides the first living memorial to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in New York City and an exciting opportunity to build on their far-reaching contributions to the nation and the world. The Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute is dedicated to innovative approaches to teaching, research, and public programming. Located in the heart of New York City, the institute provides a platform from which high quality scholarship effectively informs and influences public debate and public life. The building features two apartments, which Hunter offers to visiting scholars, as well as \\"great room\\" that can double as an auditorium. Raab was quoted as saying the renovation gave Hunter, a public university, \\"the kind of opportunity reserved for a private university.\\" Raab presided over the 2011 completion of a $131 million eight-story facility in East Harlem, which is now home to Hunter's Silberman School of Social Work. The School of Social Work was originally housed on East 79th Street, but was moved uptown in order to match the College's vision for the 21st century. The New York Times's Glenn Collins described the move as \\"a multiparty real estate deal of byzantine complexity.\\" The Council On Education For Public Health (CEPH) voted to accredit the CUNY School of Public Health when it was a unit of Hunter College (but is a now a separate unit of CUNY). In January 2012, it was announced Hunter College's graduate art school program will be moving to 95,000 square feet at 205 Hudson St. Raab was quoted as saying, \\"We will be able to create a 21st century art school.\\" At a news conference on September 10, 2012, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Hunter's new nursing, science, and health professions building to be built at 73rd Street and the East River in partnership with Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center, which is now under construction. Even with all Ms. Raab's successes, her management style was the subject of an article in The New York Times. The piece commented on Raab's appearance and was partly based on anonymous quotes, a practice the Times usually frowns upon. The piece and its timing were later regretted by the Times' Public Editor, Margaret Sullivan, who noted that Raab was being mentioned by supporters as a candidate for Chancellor of the City University system, a position that was opening up at the time. Sullivan suggested the article was unnecessarily \\"tough,\\" \\"damaging,\\" and sexist. Raab is a supporter of the DREAM Act.

Written in 1867‚Äì70, it was eventually published in 1871. There are multiple versions of the title: On the cover of the 1871 edition, the subtitle is given as \\"The Loves of the Wrens\\", however, \\"Songs of the Wrens\\" is used on the frontispiece1871 \\"blue cover\\" printing of The Window, originally published by Strahan & Co, republished in facsimile edition by Raymond J. Walker. and is the one generally used. Background George Grove, the secretary of The Crystal Palace, originally suggested a collaboration between Tennyson and Sullivan on a German-style song cycle, in English, but similar to Schubert's Die Sch√∂ne M√ºllerin. Grove was a friend of Sullivan's and an early promoter of his music. An English-language narrative song cycle, like Schubert's, was a novelty. John Everett Millais agreed to illustrate the poems for a handsome publication. On October 17, 1866, Grove and Sullivan dined with Tennyson at his home on the Isle of Wight, where they began to discuss the piece.Article about The Window by Paul Howarth, citing Young By February 1867, Tennyson had a draft of the text, but Sullivan noted in a letter he wrote home from Tennyson's house on February 10: :He read me all the songs (twelve in number), which are absolutely lovely, but I fear there will be a great difficulty in getting them from him. He thinks they are too light, and will damage his reputation, &c.; All this I have been combating, whether successfully or not I shall be able to tell you tomorrow.Howarth, citing Lawrence In August 1867, Tennyson had revised the words, and they were printed privately by Sir Ivor Guest.Lang, Andrew. Alfred Tennyson, William Blackwood and Sons, London (1901), Chapter 8 But Tennyson refused to allow publication until November 1870, when he finally agreed. By this time, however, Millais had sold the drawings he had prepared, except for one, and he was too busy to work any further on the project.Howarth, citing Allen The songs were finally published early in 1871 and included the twelve poems by Tennyson, eleven of which Sullivan had set to music, just the one illustration by Millais, and the following preface by Tennyson: :Four years ago Mr. Sullivan requested me to write a little song-cycle, German fashion, for him to exercise his art upon. He had been very successful in setting such old songs as \\"Orpheus with his Lute\\", and I drest up for him, partly in the old style, a puppet, whose almost only merit is, perhaps, that it can dance to Mr. Sullivan's instrument. I am sorry that my four year old puppet should have to dance at all in the dark shadow of these days [the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War]; but the music is now completed, and I am bound by my promise. In 1900, a second edition omitted the illustration and Tennyson's preface. Songs in the cycle :I. On the Hill ‚Äì \\"The Lights and Shadows fly.\\" :II. At the Window ‚Äì \\"Vine, Vine and Eglantine.\\" :III. Gone! ‚Äì \\"Gone ! Gone till the end of the year.\\" :IV. Winter ‚Äì \\"The Frost is here, and Fuel is dear.\\" :V.

He is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers. He played college football at Purdue University. Early years Schwantz attended William Fremd High School, where he was a two-way player in football. He received All-state, All-conference and the coaches top defensive player in Northwest Chicago honors as a senior. He had a .501 batting average as a sophomore on the baseball team and also started on the basketball team. College career Schwantz accepted a football scholarship from Purdue University. He started 5 games as a freshman and was a regular starter as a sophomore at outside linebacker, registering 10 sacks (second in the conference). He had 16 tackles against the University of Notre Dame. He suffered a broken foot during the summer, sidelining him until the start of his junior season and contributing to him having an off year, finishing with 83 tackles. As a senior, he was switched to middle linebacker, registering 143 tackles (led the team), 102 solo (led the team), 12 tackles for loss, 2 sacks and one interception (returned for a 66-yard touchdown). He had 18 tackles against the University of California. He was selected Big 10 defensive player of the week, for the 19 tackles and the 66-yard interception return for a touchdown he had against Northwestern University. He also was named to the Dean's List. At the time, he ended his college eligibility with 363 career tackles (sixth in school history), 18 career sacks (school record), 11 sacks in a season (school record) and 43 career tackles for loss (second in school history). Professional career=Chicago Bears (first stint) Schwantz was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Chicago Bears after the 1992 NFL draft. He was waived in August and signed to the practice squad. On December 25, he was promoted to the active roster to play in the season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, where he made one special teams tackle. On August 30, 1993, he was released after preseason and signed to the practice squad. On August 28, 1994, he was traded to the defending Super Bowl champions the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#201-Hayward Clay). Dallas Cowboys In 1994, the Dallas Cowboys traded for Schwantz because they were thin at the linebacker position and because he knew their defensive system, having been coached by Dave Wannstedt, who was the team's defensive coordinator before moving on to the Chicago Bears. He was declared inactive for the first 9 games. He finished with 4 defensive tackles, 5 special teams tackles and was a part of the Super Bowl XXX winning team. In 1995, he continued his development, registering 23 special teams tackles (third on the team), 15 defensive tackles and one pass defensed. In 1996, he set the franchise's single season record with 32 tackles on special teams (the NFL started keeping the stat in 1990) and was named to the Pro Bowl as a special teams player. In 1997, he was declared a restricted free agent at the end of the season and although he was seen as a valuable player, the Cowboys had serious salary cap problems and could only tender him a qualifying offer at his original undrafted signing. On April 14, the San Francisco 49ers signed him to a four-year offer sheet for $2 million that included a $600,000 signing bonus, that the Cowboys chose not to match and did not receive any compensation. San Francisco 49ers In 1997, he registered 18 special teams tackles with the San Francisco 49ers. He was cut on August 25, 1998, after the team decided to keep two younger linebackers (Anthony Peterson and Winfred Tubbs). Chicago Bears (second stint) On August 29, 1998, he was signed by the Chicago Bears as a free agent, to improve the special teams units. He was released on August 18, 1999. Schwantz played in 78 career games (no starts) and was credited with 39 defensive tackles, amounting to half a tackle per game. Mayor of Palatine On February 25, 2008, Schwantz declared his intention to run for mayor of the Village of Palatine, Illinois in the 2009 election. On April 7, 2009, he secured 42% of the vote, defeating 20-year incumbent Rita Mullins, who ended up placing a distant third in a four-way mayoral race. Schwantz was sworn into office as Mayor of Palatine on May 4, 2009. He was re-elected running unopposed to a second term as mayor in 2013, and his current term expires in 2021.

Helping to protect sharks, changing government policy, and inspiring the creation of shark conservation groups, Sharkwater is considered one of conservation's success stories, resulting in shark finning being banned in over 90 countries. https://sharkwater.com/sharkwater-extinction/sharkwater- extinction-synopsis/ In the film, Stewart filmed current attitudes about sharks, and how shark-hunting industries are driving them to extinction. Sharkwater explores the densest shark hunting populations in the world, exposing the exploitation and corruption of the shark-hunting industry in the marine reserves of Cocos Island, Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Stewart travels with Paul Watson and his Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ship as they confront shark poachers in Guatemala and Costa Rica. Among the group's experiences are boat confrontations, poachers, police, corrupt court systems, and eventually murder charges. Also, Stewart states how the increasing demand for shark-fin soup in Asia is fuelling an illegal trade in sharks. His expedition is cut short, however, when he is diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, from which he recovers. Stewart discovers that sharks prevent the overconsumption of plankton by other fish, which moderates climate change. Yet sharks have gone from predator to prey, and while they have survived Earth's mass extinctions, they could be extinct within a few years. The film has received 31 international awards.

Biography He was born in Lowestoft in the county of Suffolk and raised in the Exclusive Plymouth Brethren, a Christian sect, from which he apostatised at the age of 21. In 1943, aged 34, after ten years of self-enquiry, study and writing, Harding had decided he was made of 'layers'. What he was depended on the range of the observer. As a result of his studies, Harding was convinced that he was human only at a certain range. Closer to, he saw himself as cellular, molecular, atomic. At very close range, therefore, he saw himself as almost nothing. It made sense to him therefore that at centre he was a mysterious 'nothingness'. In 1943, he looked back at himself and noticed that from his own point of view he was headless. He was looking not out of two eyes but a 'single eye', a boundless openness ‚Äì an openness that was self-evidently aware, and was also full of the whole world. Here was direct experience of his central identity, his True Self. No longer did he have to rely on speculation. Following this he spent the next 8 years exploring the scientific, philosophical, psychological, religious... implications of his discovery, presented in his book The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth, described by C. S. Lewis (who wrote the preface) as \\"a work of the highest genius\\". This book was published by Faber & Faber in 1952. After taking time off from his profession, Harding then returned to architecture. Harding continued to write, however, but it was not until 1964 that he clearly shared the experience of 'headlessness' with another person - his secretary. Following this, Harding gradually began to share 'Seeing' more widely. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Harding developed his 'experiments'. Harding described these experiments as 'a breakthrough' in terms of making easily available the experience of 'who we really are', our true nature - which is No-thing and Everything. Harding was emphatic that people tested out his claims for themselves - \\"you are the sole and final authority on you\\". He rejected the role of 'guru', always pointing others back to themselves. \\"Look for yourself\\". Harding said of this meditation, \\"While it lasts, this is an all-or-nothing (actually, an All-and- Nothing) meditation which can't be done badly.\\"'The Toolkit for Testing the Incredible Hypothesis', D.E. Harding, Shollund Publications, 1972 (out of print) As well as writing many books and articles, and developing his experiments, Harding also designed his Youniverse Explorer model, which models the layers of our body/mind, from the galaxy to particles, and includes at the centre of all these layers a clear sphere, symbolising one's True Nature - one's No-face. Harding travelled widely, sharing 'Seeing'. In the 1990s and early 2000s he travelled and gave workshops with his second wife, Catherine. Harding was married twice and had two sons and a daughter. He died at Nacton near Ipswich, England.

The robbers escaped with at least $60,000 () and killed a bystander outside. The robbery is believed to have been conducted by a group of former Confederate guerrillas, possibly led by Jesse James or Archie Clement, which became known as the James‚ÄìYounger Gang. According to accounts of the day: * On the afternoon of February 13, 1866, \\"some ten or twelve persons rode into town\\" and milled outside the Clay County Savings Association building. * Two of the riders entered the bank, which was staffed only by the head cashier, Greenup Bird, and his son, William Bird, who was a bank clerk. * After asking to change a $10 bill, the men drew revolvers and demanded money. * William loaded the robbers' feed sack with gold, currency, bonds, and tax stamps. * The two Birds were herded into the bank's vault, and the robbers left the building. * As the robbers mounted to ride away, shots were fired. Accounts differ: problems with mounting a horse caused a \\"commotion\\" during which someone opened fire, or perhaps one of the gang fired \\"without any sort of provocation whatever\\". George \\"Jolly\\" Wymore, a 19-year-old student from William Jewell College who was across the street, was killed by a bullet. * The gang rode away, pursued after a time by a posse of \\"outraged\\" townspeople who \\"could procure arms and horses\\". The entire maneuver lasted no more than 15 minutes. In total, the robbers collected at least $60,000. Reportedly they collected government bonds worth $42,000 to $45,000, $518 in tax stamps, gold, silver coins, and banknotes. The bank offered a $5,000 reward for recovery of the money. Attempts to track the robbers were hindered by snow that covered their tracks. Articles in local newspapers implicated both former Confederate bushwackers and Kansas Redlegs of the crime. Later, some townspeople admitted to recognizing some of the robbers but withholding the information out of fear. The robbers were never caught, and no money was ever recovered. The Association eventually settled with creditors for 60 cents on the dollar and closed. The building is located at 104 East Franklin Street, a block northeast of the Clay County Courthouse. It was built in 1859, and is a two-story, Federal style rectangular brick building with a gable roof. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

The former title was nominated for Montana New Zealand Book Awards in 2006, and was an American Library Association best book of 2007. Dreamquake received recognition as an Honor Book for the Michael L. Printz Award in 2008. The U.K. title of Dreamhunter is The Rainbow Opera. Synopsis Southland is an alternate universe Edwardian version of a New Zealand, one without any indigenous inhabitants. Instead, Southland boasts an other-dimensional realm entitled \\"the Place,\\" in which those able to do so can 'capture' dreams that are bound to particular areas of Place geography, which exist within specific bands. As a result of the discovery of guided dreaming, a dreamhunter industry has been created. Professional dreamhunters occupy a social niche comparable to artists and authors in our own world, and one of the most imposing structures in Founderston, Southland's capital, is the \\"Rainbow Opera,\\" in which virtuoso dreamhunters perform before the nation's elite. Grace Tiebold and Tziga Hame are sister and brother in law by marriage, and are particularly potent dreamhunters. While Grace's daughter Rose lacks the talent, Tziga's daughter Laura possesses it. Each year, scores of teenagers attempt to become dreamhunters in a rite of passage, but few achieve interdimensional transit to the Place. Tziga and Laura Hame are able to create golems using an ancestral power called \\"The Measures.\\" In the second novel, it transpires that these golems have an unheralded but ingenious relationship to the Place's very existence. Southland was settled by the British, later than America but earlier than Australia. People from Elprus, an Aegean island obliterated by volcanic activity, arrived in the eighteenth century. Southland's official church is a \\"Southern Orthodox Church\\" which regards the practice of dreamhunting as immoral and unethical. Southland's republican government begs to differ, as its unscrupulous Minister of the Interior, Cas Doran, was the architect of the Intangible Resources Act 1896, and is planning a coup d'etat which will exploit dreamhunter capabilities to provide manipulated consent to his anticipated authoritarian rule. Characters=Laura Hame Laura Hame is the protagonist and heroine of the duet. She is about sixteen years old and is the daughter of the famous dreamhunter Tziga Hame, who was the first ever. Her mother died when she was very young and she lives with her father, her aunt, Grace Tiebold, her mother's brother, Chorley Tiebold, and her cousin and best friend Rose Tiebold. When they are old enough Laura and Rose Try (the trial of becoming a dreamhunter), and while Laura is successful, it turns out Rose does not have the ability and therefore cannot become a dreamhunter. This puts a slight strain on their relationship, though they remain best friends as ever. Rose was always the leader in their relationship, and Laura, being more shy and timid, is not used to making decisions by herself. She gains a lot of independence throughout the books by finally learning how to get by without having Rose with her at all times. Laura discovers the terrible deeds that the government executes using dreamhunting (namely the torture of prisoners via nightmares and the use of the dream \\"Contentment\\" -which makes one purposeless and zombie-like- to achieve their ends). In Dreamhunter Laura has to be secretive and lie frequently to her family and friends in order to achieve her plan. Because of this she becomes lonely and the only person she can truly trust is her \\"servant\\" Nown. Nown is a creature made of sand who must serve the person who creates him, in this case Laura. Laura grows to rely heavily on Nown (although not in a romantic way). However at the end of Dreamhunter Nown goes missing. In Dreamquake Laura instead finds herself being drawn more and more to Sandy Mason, a young man who is in love with her. When catching a dream together in \\"The Place\\" Laura realizes her love for him and they sleep together. Later, when at a ball, the building is set on fire. Laura believes Sandy has died in the fire and becomes depressed, hardly ever coming out of bed. She and her family realize she is pregnant with Sandy's child. Fortunately it turns out he was kidnapped and taken to a camp where they gave him doses of Contentment. Sandy makes his way back and is welcomed into the family, who are overjoyed. At the end of the series they get married. Rose Tiebold Rose Tiebold is Laura Hame's cousin and best friend. She is very outgoing and confident and always believed that she would successfully try to become a dreamhunter. When this is not the case she is shocked and miserable. However her father, Chorley Tiebold, who unlike her mother is not a dreamhunter, tells her that there are many options other than becoming a dreamhunter and he doesn't see why it is such a desirable career anyway. Rose listens to his words and continues to thrive, though she becomes slightly more distant from Laura. Rose soon befriends a girl called Mamie Doran, the daughter of mayor who is a lonely and intelligent girl, though at times slightly spiteful. Rose helps Laura and the rest of her family revolt against the government. Sandy Mason Alexander Mason, otherwise known as Sandy Mason, is a young man introduced in the first novel. He is roughly between seventeen and nineteen. Coming from a rather poor family, when he first meets Laura Hame and Rose Tiebold, he doesn't respect them and thinks they are just \\"silly little children\\". However, in Dreamquake he falls in love with Laura. In Dreamhunter, he Tries and it turns out he can catch dreams. He and Laura, live in the same motel, called \\"Miss Lilley's\\". In Dreamquake he mistakes a letter Laura wrote to her servant, Nown, as a letter to suitor. He draws within himself and becomes moody. When he realizes this isn't the case, he looks after Laura, and they work together. Laura soon finds she loves him too, and while catching a dream called \\"The Gate\\", they both kiss each other and become \\"suitors\\". When at a ball the building sets on fire, and Sandy is believed dead. As it turns out at the end of the book, he was kidnapped and sent to a camp where he was given doses of the dream Contentment. When the camp is closed thanks to the revolution, Sandy travels back to Laura and her family and is welcomed with open arms. Laura is pregnant with Sandy's child and they get married.

He is the bench coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Pirates, Detroit Tigers, and Miami Marlins. Kelly played every position on the field in the major leagues, including pitcher. Over the course of his career, he mainly played the outfield and third base. Career Don Kelly was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Butler, Pennsylvania and played baseball at suburban Mt. Lebanon High School; in his senior year the team won the Class AAA state title. At Mount Lebanon, he regularly alternated between the two middle infield positions with Josh Wilson, another future Major League player. He was not then considered a \\"draftable\\" player and attended Point Park College, a liberal arts college in downtown Pittsburgh. Over three seasons he batted .413 and struck out just 20 times in over 500 at-bats. In the summer of 2000 Kelly played for the Petersburg Generals of the Coastal Plain League‚Äîa collegiate summer league. Kelly's collegiate performance prompted interest from major league teams and the Detroit Tigers drafted him in the eighth round (237th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. Detroit assigned him to the Low-A Oneonta Tigers in the New York‚ÄìPenn League, where he batted .286 and struck out sixteen times‚Äîsecond lowest in the league. The next year Detroit promoted him to the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps in the Midwest League. Kelly was named the starting shortstop for the Eastern All-Stars in the league's mid-season All-Star game. Kelly's versatility was first put to the test at the professional level when he was with the High-A Lakeland Tigers in 2003. He shifted to third base when Anderson Hern√°ndez replaced him at shortstop. Kelly eventually spent more time at first and second base after Ryan Raburn took over at third. Kelly got off to a strong start: by mid-June his .363 average led the Florida State League and the local Ledger described him as a \\"slugger.\\" Although his average eventually cooled to .317, Detroit promoted him in mid-season to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves, where he joined future brother-in-law Matt Walker (brother of current Major League infielder Neil Walker). In 2004 Detroit invited Kelly to spring training, and in his first at-bat in a spring training game Kelly hit a home run against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On March 17, Detroit optioned Kelly back to Erie, but he missed most of the season with an injured shoulder. Kelly returned to Erie in 2005 and picked up where he had left off, hitting .340 over 82 games. Baseball America named Kelly the best-hitting prospect in the Eastern League. On June 30, Detroit promoted him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League, one step away from the majors. Kelly played in 43 games for the Mud Hens in 2005 and batted .250, a tenure partially interrupted by a groin injury. Commented Mud Hens manager Larry Parrish: \\"Hitting-wise, there's been a little bit of an adjustment for him here...He tore up Double-A, and here he's done alright. He's holding his own. But it's his first year here, and he's still going through a learning process.\\" In the off-season Kelly played for the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League. In 2006 Kelly almost made the Major League team out of spring training but instead returned to Toledo. Detroit manager Jim Leyland said \\"When push came to shove, he ran into a numbers game.\\" At Toledo Kelly's numbers fell off; Detroit demoted him to Erie after hitting .228. At Erie his numbers improved to .272, but at the end of the season Detroit removed Kelly from their 40-man roster, making him a free agent. Pittsburgh Pirates The Pittsburgh Pirates, Kelly's hometown team, signed him to a minor league contract on December 14, 2006. He made the Major League team as a utility player, filling in at second base, shortstop, and left and right field. His major league debut came on April 2, 2007 in a season-opening 4‚Äì2 victory over the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park. As a pinch hitter for D√°maso Marte, Kelly popped out to the shortstop to end the Pirates half of the ninth inning. He finished the game at second base. Kelly played sparingly, amassing 27 at-bats over 25 games and hitting .148, before Pittsburgh designated him for assignment on June 12 to make room for Dan Kolb. Kelly cleared waivers and joined the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians on June 23. Kelly finished out the season with Indianapolis, batting .247 and playing both shortstop and in the outfield. Pittsburgh granted Kelly free agency at the end of the season. Arizona Diamondbacks Kelly signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks and spent the entire 2008 season with the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders, where he batted .275 but never made it with the major league club and was granted free agency at the end of the season. Detroit Tigers In 2009 Kelly signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Tigers. Following spring training Kelly rejoined the Mud Hens, with whom he had last played in 2006. On June 11, 2009, the Tigers called Kelly up to the Major League club to replace outfielder Clete Thomas. Kelly played his first game for Detroit against the Pittsburgh Pirates, his former club. After going hitless in his first game, he hit a two- RBI single and a double against Pittsburgh, obtaining his first major league extra base hit and RBIs. On October 1, 2010, Kelly hit a home run in both games of a doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles. Jhonny Peralta greets Kelly after a home run at Dodger Stadium In his first two seasons with the Tigers, Kelly added first and third base and center field to the positions he has played in the majors. He was called on to pitch with two outs in the top of the ninth inning after manager Jim Leyland thoroughly depleted his bullpen in a 16‚Äì9 defeat to the New York Mets at Comerica Park on June 29, 2011. Throwing only five pitches, he used a curveball to get Scott Hairston to fly out to center field. Kelly was the first position player to pitch in a game for the Tigers since Shane Halter did it in October 2000. He reached the milestone of having played every position on the field in his major league career in a 15‚Äì3 loss at home to the San Francisco Giants three nights later on July 2. He entered the contest at the start of the fourth inning, replacing starting catcher V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez who had left the game with a bruised right shoulder. In the decisive Game 5 of the 2011 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Kelly belted a first-inning solo home run off Iv√°n Nova into the right field seats at Yankee Stadium to give the Tigers a 1‚Äì0 lead, one which they never relinquished. Detroit went on to win the game, 3‚Äì2, and moved on to face the Texas Rangers in the American League Championship Series. On August 3, 2012, Kelly was designated for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for outfielder Andy Dirks, who returned to the Tigers after coming off the disabled list the same day. On August 9, 2012, Kelly cleared waivers and his contract was outrighted by Detroit to their Triple-A affiliate Toledo. The Tigers called him up again on September 1, and later named him to their post-season roster after the team clinched the AL Central division. He hit a walk-off sacrifice fly in Game 2 of Detroit's American League Division Series against the Oakland Athletics. On October 31, 2012, Don Kelly cleared waivers and became a free agent. On January 16, 2013, Kelly signed a minor league deal with the Tigers. He made the team out of spring training, and played another full season as the club's super-utility man. In 216 at-bats, Don hit .222 with six home runs and 23 RBIs, while playing six defensive positions. After the season, Kelly signed a one-year deal with Detroit that would pay him $1 million in 2014, avoiding arbitration. On November 3, 2014, Kelly declined his minor league assignment and became a free agent. Miami Marlins On January 18, 2015, Kelly signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. When Miami played Detroit in a spring training game in Lakeland, Florida, Kelly received a standing ovation from Tigers fans. After hitting .270 with two doubles and five RBI with .681 OPS in Spring training, the Marlins purchased Kelly's contract and placed him on the Opening Roster. Kelly suffered a fractured finger early in the 2015 season and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 13. Kelly had two at-bats before getting hurt and was 0-for-2. On July 18, 2015, the Marlins announced that Kelly would have season-ending Tommy John surgery. Kelly during his tenure with the New Orleans Zephyrs, triple-A affiliates of the Marlins, in 2016. On February 3, 2016, Kelly re-signed with the Marlins to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training. He was released by the Marlins on March 29 and re-signed the next day. Kelly was called up from New Orleans on July 6. With the return of Dee Gordon to the Marlins roster after an 80-day suspension for PED use, Kelly was designated for assignment on July 28, 2016.  Post playing career  In February 2017, Kelly was named a scout and assistant on the player development staff for the Detroit Tigers organization. On September 29, 2017, Kelly was promoted to a Major League scout for the Tigers. On November 21, 2018, Kelly was named the Houston Astros first base coach. Kelly was named the Pittsburgh Pirates bench coach on December 7, 2019.  Personal life  Kelly spends his offseasons in Mars, PA, with his wife, Carrie, and their three sons, Brett, Luke and Brooks.

The questionnaires are made in a program for creating web interviews. The program allows for the questionnaire to contain pictures, audio and video clips, links to different web pages, etc. The website is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is considered to be a cheaper way of surveying since one doesn't need to use people to hold surveys unlike computer-assisted telephone interviewing. With the increasing use of the Internet, online questionnaires have become a popular way of collecting information. The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered. There are many factors in designing an online questionnaire; guidelines, available question formats, administration, quality and ethic issues should be reviewed. Online questionnaires should be seen as a sub-set of a wider-range of online research methods.

San Diego, CA: Academic Press. Advantages * The administrator has greater flexibility in displaying questions. Questions can be displayed with: ** Check boxes ** Pull-down menus ** Pop-up menus ** Help screens ** Sub menus * An online forum allows responses to be received more quickly from subjects.Bradburn, Norman M., Sudman, Seymour, Wansink, Brian, Asking Questions: The Definitive Guide to Questionnaire Design ‚Äì For Market Research, Political Polls, and Social and Health Questionnaires. Jossey-Bass. 2004 * This method is also cheaper to administer, as there are no costs associated with purchasing paper or other materials for printing. Postage costs are also mitigated.Online Questionnaire Design Guide, \\"Web Based Questionnaires\\" [cited Mar 10, 2007]. Available HTTP * Since data is collected into a central database, the time for analysis is subsequently reduced.StatPac, \\"Questionnaire Design - General Considerations\\" [cited Feb 24, 2007]. Available HTTP * It is easier to correct errors on an online questionnaire, since the administrator does not have to reprint all the questionnaires for distribution. Disadvantages * Not everyone has access to the Internet, so the response rate is limited. * Many people are not receptive to completing questionnaires online.Presser, Stanley, Rothgeb, Jennifer M., Couper, Mick P., Lessler, Judith T., Martin, Elizabeth, Martin, Jean, Singer, Eleanor, Methods for Testing and Evaluating Questionnaire Questionnaires. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2004 * Studies indicate that the demographic that responds to online questionnaire invitations are generally biased to younger people.Groves, Robert M., Fowler, Floyd J., Couper, Mick P., Lepkowski, James M., Singer, Eleanor, Tourangeau, Roger, Questionnaire Methodology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2004 exactly Questionnaire design An online questionnaire needs to be carefully thought through before it is launched. There are several important paradigms that should be considered when creating an online questionnaire. Collection and prioritization of data * The objectives of the initial inquiry need to be reviewed to determine what information needs to be gathered.National Research Council of Canada, \\"Online Questionnaire Design\\" [cited Mar 10, 2007]. Available HTTP * The required information should be ranked in order of significance in an unbiased manner. Topics should not lead a person into making false conclusions.QuestionPro, \\"Preparing an Online Questionnaire - How to Conduct an Online Questionnaire\\" [cited Mar 10, 2007]. Available HTTP Online questionnaire format * The questionnaire should begin with a short introduction that informs the subject why the questionnaire is being conducted. * Questions for questionnaire should be created in the most appropriate type of format that facilitates understanding. * In creating the layout of the online questionnaire, ‚Äúsmart branching‚Äù should be utilized to lessen complexity. For example, if a subject selects ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a question, the questionnaire would automatically jump to the next relevant question and vice versa. * A brief ‚Äúthank you‚Äù note should be included at the end of the questionnaire. Questionnaire length * As a rule of thumb, the questionnaire should not exceed 5 minutes. ** Generally, 4 multiple choice questions take 1 minute. ** One short answer question is equivalent to 3 multiple choice questions. Prototyping * A sample of the questionnaire should be distributed to at least five people, prior to publication on the web. Upon their completion of the questionnaire, feedback from the participants should be obtained. ** Information relating to whether they understood the main point of the questionnaire should be gathered. ** It is important to distinguish if participants had any difficulties with any of the questions. ** The feedback of the subjects should be utilized to make any necessary changes to the questionnaire. Question formats In designing a questionnaire, the evaluation method should be kept in mind when choosing the response format. In this section, there are various response formats that can be used on online questionnaires. =Radio buttons= Image:RadioButton.jpg The respondent is required to click on the circle, which corresponds to the desired answer. A dot in the middle will appear once an answer is chosen. Only one answer can be chosen. * Recommended when the choice of answers are mutually exclusive. * No default answer should be provided. If a default answer is provided, it may be mistaken as an answer if the respondent chooses to skip the question. * Require precision in clicking. =Check boxes= Image:CheckBox5.jpg The respondent is required to click on the box next to the answer that corresponds to the desired choice. A checkmark will appear in the box once an answer is chosen. More than one answer can be selected. * If there are many options, a simple matrix is recommended. * When using check boxes, if more than one answer can be checked, it should be specified in the instructions. * If ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù is required, provide it with a radio button to prevent an erroneous check on this choice in case another answer has been chosen. =Drop-down menus= Image:DropDown5.jpg The respondent is required to click on the arrow on the far right side of the box. Once clicked, a display with a list of answers will appear. A scroll bar may appear on the right hand side if a large number of answers are displayed. The respondent can click on the highlighted section of the list to select an answer. This answer will then appear in the box. Only one answer can be selected for this type of question. * Good option for long lists such as state/country of residence. * Should be avoided for items where typing is faster. For example, year of birth. * In designing drop-down boxes, do not make the first option visible to the respondent. This may be misleading where no answer may be chosen. =Open-ended questions= Open-ended questions are those that allow respondents to answer in their own words. In an online survey, textboxes are provided with the question prompt in order for respondents to type in their answer. Open-ended questions seek a free response and aim to determine what is at the tip of the respondent's mind. These are good to use when asking for attitude or feelings, likes and dislikes, memory recall, opinions, or additional comments.Survey Monkey, Smart Survey Design (2007), http://s3.amazonaws.com/SurveyMonkeyFiles/SmartSurvey.pdf The respondent is required to click inside of the text box to get the cursor inside the box. Once the cursor is blinking inside of the box, the answer of the question can be typed in. * Make the size of the text box according to the desired and required amount of information from the respondent. * Provide concise and clear input instructions. =Rating scales= The respondent must select one value from a scale of possible options; for example, poor, fair, good, or excellent. Rating scales allow the person conducting the survey to measure and compare sets of variables. * If using rating scales, be consistent throughout the survey. Use the same number of points on the scale and make sure meanings of high and low stay consistent throughout the survey. * Use an odd number in the rating scale to make data analysis easier. Switching the rating scales around will confuse survey takers, which will lead to untrustworthy responses. * Limit the number of items in ranking or rating scale questions to fewer than ten. These questions can become difficult to read after ten options. Longer rating or ranking questions can also cause display issues in some environments. Online questionnaires=Responses Response rates are frequently quite low and there is a danger that they will continue to drop due to over-surveying of web-users. Jon Krosnick argues that the following three factors determine the successfulness of the questionnaire and the likelihood of achieving decent levels of response. # Respondent ability # Respondent motivation # Task difficulty/questionnaire designSee for a list of Krosnick's publications Bosnjak and Tuten argue that there are at least seven ways in which online surveys are responded to.Bosnjak, M. and Tuten, T. L. (2001) Classifying response behaviors in web-based surveys, Journal of Computer- Mediated Communication, 6, 3. http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol6/issue3/boznjak.html They establish the following typology # Complete responders are those respondents who view all questions and answer all questions. # Unit nonresponders are those individuals who do not participate in the survey. There are two possible variations to the unit nonresponder. Such an individual could be technically hindered from participation, or he or she may purposefully withdraw after the welcome screen is displayed, but prior to viewing any questions. # Answering Drop-Outs consist of individuals who provide answers to those questions displayed, but quit prior to completing the survey. # Lurkers view all of the questions in the survey, but do not answer any of the questions. # Lurking drop-outs represent a combination of 3 and 4. Such a participant views some of the questions without answering, but also quits the survey prior to reaching the end. # Item non-responders view the entire questionnaire, but only answer some of the questions. # Item non- responding drop-outs represent a mixture of 3 and 6. Individuals displaying this response behavior view some of the questions, answer some but not all of the questions viewed, and also quit prior to the end of the survey. Administration Once the questionnaire is designed, it must be administered to the appropriate sample population for data collection. Attracting the appropriate target audience often requires advertisement. There are various methods used to attract participants * bulletin boards * mass emails * advertisements in commercial areas * mail * monetary incentives * discounts on company products This usually helps in attracting willing participants which ultimately provide better quality data as opposed to reluctant participants. Location of administration for the online questionnaire may be a factor in the administration if a specific environment is required. A quiet environment may be needed for questions, which require a certain amount of concentration.Couper, Mick P., Baker, Reginald P., Clark, Cynthia Z. F., Martin, Jean, Nicholls, William L., O'Reilly, James M., Computer Assisted Survey Information Collection. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998 The questionnaire may need to be administered in a secluded environment to protect sensitive information provided by the participant. Security measures in the software may also need to be added in these cases. In contrast, online questionnaires may also be very informal and relaxed and can be conducted in the comfort of someone‚Äôs home. Quality Questionnaire quality can be measured through the value of the data obtained and participant satisfaction. To maintain a high quality questionnaire length, conciseness and question sequence should be considered. First, questionnaires should only be as long as they need to be. Conciseness can be achieved through removing redundant and irrelevant questions, which can add frustration to the participant, but not value to the research. Finally, placing questions in a logical sequence also gives the participants a better mental map as they are filling out the questionnaire. Moving randomly between subjects and having answers in a non- intuitive sequence can confuse the participant. Ethics Ethical issues should be considered when gathering data from a target audience. Below are common things one should keep in mind when considering the rights and interests of the participant. * Participants should not be obliged to answer any of the questions. * Incentives to take a survey should be used sparingly. * Questionnaires should have the option to be anonymous. * Confidentiality must be imposed on certain questionnaires. Identification may be required on questionnaires that need follow up. Although, in this case the administrator may choose to use identifying numbers rather than names. In this case, the participant of the questionnaire should completely understand what the number is used for and why it is there. * Questions should have the option of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or an option that denotes neutrality so the participant feels he/she has the opportunity to plead ignorance or neutrality so that inaccurate data is not provided. * Questions should not trick the participant. They should be worded clearly; the participant should feel comfortable and know exactly what he or she is responding to. * Participant in most cases should know why the questionnaire is taking place and what the information will be used for. * In some cases, the questionnaire should be reviewed by an ethics committee or outside party. This is particularly important if the questionnaire involves giving sensitive information or the topic is one which may make some participants uncomfortable.

Established in 1948, it was the first agency of its kind in Canada,http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saskatchewan-arts- board-emc/ predating the Canada Council for the Arts by nine years. The Arts Board has offices in Regina and Saskatoon. In May 2020, the agency changed its name to SK Arts. The Arts Board is governed by The Arts Board Act, 1997, and funded by the Government of Saskatchewan through the Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport. The Arts Board receives additional support from the Saskatchewan Lotteries Trust Fund for Sport, Culture and Recreation as a result of the Arts Board's partnership with SaskCulture Inc. Although officially appointed by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council, one-third of the members of the Arts Board's board of directors is chosen from a list of nominees provided by the arts community. This process assists in ensuring the Arts Board is representative of the thoughts, ideas and directions of the community itself. The board reports to the province's minister responsible for the Saskatchewan Arts Board.  Funding and Programs  The Arts Board offers several funding opportunities and programs for individuals and organizations, including: * Accessibility Fund * Artists in Communities * Artists in Schools * Independent Artists Program * Indigenous Peoples Art and Artists * Micro- Grant Program * Prince Edward Arts Scholarship * Professional Arts Organizations Program * SaskFestivals The Arts Board also administers grant and award programs in partnership with other agencies, such as the Access Copyright Foundation and the Saskatchewan Foundation for the Arts.  Permanent Collection  The Arts Board's Permanent Collection is a collection of art by Saskatchewan artists. It includes approximately 3,000 works of art in all media by 750 artists and is the largest body of work by Saskatchewan artists in the world. The Arts Board makes the Permanent Collection accessible by bringing it to workplaces, schools and communities. Works form the collection are loaned to galleries and other venues around the province and country for exhibitions, film production, broadcast and publication opportunities. The Arts Board's Art Rental program brings artwork into the office. Art Rental clients are Saskatchewan government departments, agencies, crown corporations, boards, commissions and the corporate sector. Non-profit organizations and institutions may also rent art from the Collection.  Saskatchewan Arts Awards  In 1988, the Arts Board established the Lifetime Award for Excellence in the Arts. The award honours Saskatchewan individuals whose accomplishments have had a major impact on the arts provincially, nationally and internationally. In 2004, the awards program expanded and the Arts Board established the Lieutenant Governor's Arts Awards to recognize the achievements made by individuals, groups and organizations in the arts. In 2016, it was renamed the Saskatchewan Arts Awards. In addition to the award, all recipients receive a cash prize. Award categories include Lieutenant Governor's Lifetime Achievement, Emerging Artist, Leadership - Individual, Leadership - Organization, Arts and Learning, and Artistic Excellence.  Partnerships  * Legislative Building 100th Anniversary Artist Residency The Legislative Building Artist in Residence Program was part of the province's year-long celebration in 2012 of the 100th anniversary of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. It was developed in partnership with the Arts Board. The eight participants explored the history and significance of the building through their own artistic disciplines. Each artist hosted a community engaged project to encourage cultural exchange at the building and created a work of art that is displayed in one of the alcoves in the Rotunda. The artwork was unveiled in December 2012. * Artists in the Community The Artists in the Community project ran from October 2006 to September 2007. It was presented by the Arts Board in collaboration with the City of Saskatoon, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program of the Department of Canadian Heritage. Eight community-based residencies were selected from a broad variety of sectors within Saskatoon. Organizational staff, volunteers, community members, managers, and organization clientele had the unique opportunity to work with an artist for six to nine months. * Art at Work In 2004, the Art At Work project was presented by the Arts Board, in collaboration with the City of Regina, with the financial support of the Cultural Capitals of Canada program. 100 Years of Heart: Celebrating Saskatchewan's Centennial The Arts Board was involved in celebrating Saskatchewan's Centennial in 2005 with two important projects: * Centennial Commissions Project: To celebrate the Saskatchewan Centennial, the Arts Board commissioned the design, creation, and installation of four large-scale, permanent, outdoor artworks in four Saskatchewan communities: Estevan (Spinning Prairie by Jefferson Little); Lloydminster (Sky Dance by Douglas Bentham); Yorkton (Doorways to Opportunity by Lionel Peyachew) and LaRonge (Portage by Chris St. Amand). * Saskatchewan Centennial Mural Project: The Province of Saskatchewan designated funding for the creation of a large mural in the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. The painting was installed in the building rotunda. Roger Jerome, a M√©tis artist from Air Ronge, designed and painted the mural, Northern Tradition and Transition.

Kalb and the blues ethnomusicologist Sam Charters formed the New Strangers. He joined Van Ronk's Ragtime Jug Stompers in 1963. Inspired by the African-American bluesmen Son House, Skip James and Mississippi John Hurt, Kalb experimented with acoustic and electronic music. At the age of 15 Kalb formed the band Gay Notes and performed with Bob Dylan on a WBAI-FM concert broadcast in 1961. In 1963 Kalb performed in the Ragtime Jug Stompers with his mentor Dave Van Ronk. In 1964 he recorded as Folk Stringers, produced by guitarist and writer Sam Charters, who has written: \\"It was generally conceded ... that ... Kalb was the most exciting of the new players.\\". In 1964 Kalb played second guitar on Phil Ochs's album All the News That's Fit to Sing and in 1964 appeared on Judy Collins's Fifth Album. In 1965, Kalb formed the Blues Project with Steve Katz, Andy Kulberg, Roy Blumenfeld and Tommy Flanders. Flanders later left the band and was replaced by Al Kooper. They recorded three albums, played frequently at the Cafe Au Go Go and at Murray the K's last \\"submarine race-watching\\" spectacular at the RKO 58th Street theater in New York, and made several concert tours, disbanding in 1971. In 1965 the Blues Project performed an eleven-minute rendition of Muddy Waters's \\"Two Trains Running\\" in electronic form, with Waters in the audience. When asked what he thought of it, Waters said, \\"You really got me.\\" Kalb later said, \\"If I'd dropped dead at that point on the spot because of what we thought of Muddy Waters, then my life would have been well spent.\\" Personality clashes, drugs and the 1960s lifestyle took their toll on the band. Katz and Kooper left to form Blood, Sweat and Tears. Howard L Solomon (Cafe au Go Go owner and promoter) wrote in a 1999 email to Kalb's Webmaster, \\"Danny Kalb ... is up there with the best of all blues legends ... His work for me at Cafe' au Go Go was amazing ... I've worked with the greatest of all time and he is at the top ... Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Jimi Hendrix, John Mayall, Zappa, all greats, but Danny will emerge in the top 5.\\" In 1968 he released Crosscurrents with Stefan Grossman. He was fairly quiet for the next twenty years, but joined Al Kooper for a Blues Project reunion, recorded at the Bottom Line in 1996. In the 21st century, Kalb performs solo acoustic gigs, plays acoustic and electric music with the Danny Kalb Trio, including Bob Jones on acoustic bass and Mark Ambrosino on drums and occasionally performs with Stefan Grossman and Steve Katz and with his brother Jonathan Kalb. The Danny Kalb Trio recorded I'm Gonna Live the Life I Sing About (Sojourn) in 2008, which received critical acclaim in the blues media. This was followed in 2013 by Kalb's first double-CD. Moving in Blue, also on the Sojourn label, featuring various sidemen and guest artists. With this album he parlays the full range of his musical interests and creativity. Kalb has continued to play the vintage early 1960s Gibson J-200 with which he began his career. He also uses a Mexican-made Martin acoustic-electric and a Greco Les Paul-style electric guitar. His Solo projects include Livin‚Äô with the Blues (Legend 1995), All Together Now( self-released 2002), Live in Princeton (self-released 2003), and Live in Brooklyn (self-released 2006). Crosscurrents, the 1968 LP with Stefan Grossman was re-released as CD in 2006 and a new CD, Played a Little Fiddle, was released in 2007 by Kalb, Katz and Grossman.

And shall thy wrath burn like fire?\\" (Psalm 89). The words are inscribed on the painting's frame along with a quotation from one of Cromwell's speeches, in which he describes his life before entering into politics: \\"living neither in any considerable height, nor yet in obscurity, I did endeavour to discharge the duty of an honest man.\\"National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, Artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Circle: the First Generation, 1988, pp. 49-51. Historical background The painting depicts Cromwell as a country squire on his lands in Cambridgeshire, before he became a national figure in the power struggles which culminated in the English Civil War. Cromwell's identity as a leading revolutionary had been affirmed by Thomas Carlyle's biography Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations (1845), in which his reluctance to take up the role of leader was emphasised. Carlyle was an important influence on Brown. Composition The painting's central theme is that of enforced inertia. In it, Cromwell is portrayed as someone who has the capacity to become a major player on the national stage, but who is restricted to his own small world. It emphasises inertia through the portrayal of the distraction of Cromwell's horse by wayside fodder, which is also being eaten by a lamb from the farm: a reference to the concept of the Christian flock. The wandering piglets following a sow under Cromwell's horse refer to the story of the Gadarene swine. Cromwell carries an oak sapling in lieu of a whip, and a copy of the Bible. The farm is a metaphor for the state, a place in which orderly labour is threatened continually by forces of disorder and in which the most everyday details are potentially filled with moral and eschatological significance.Trodd, C, Culture and Energy, Ford Madox Brown and the Cromwellian grotesque, Victorian Culture and the Idea of the Grotesque, 1998, pp. 68-73. While the workers on the left of the composition are getting on with their labours, clearing away weeds, the servant at the right is demanding a response from Cromwell, her shout repeated by the screeching duck she carries. The pigs under the horse and the lamb all create a potential for disruption and instability. Behind the workers clearing weeds, a young farm worker barely controls the large herd of cattle streaming through the gate into Crowmell's farm, separating the latter from his wife and child, visible at the door of the house at the right. A spot of blood can be seen on Cromwell's collar, a reference to a famous description of him by Sir Philip Warwick, and emblematic of a bloodstained future.Warwick wrote \\"He wore... a plain cloth-suit, which seemed to have been made by a poor tailor; his shirt was plain, and not very clean; and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his collar; NotesSee also *Cromwell, Protector of the Vaudois (1877) Category:1874 paintings Category:Paintings by Ford Madox Brown Category:Collections of the Lady Lever Art Gallery Category:Cultural depictions of Oliver Cromwell Category:Horses in art Category:Sheep in art Category:Farming in art Category:Pigs in art ","title":"Cromwell on his Farm"},{"id":"10428984","text":"A combat tourniquet commonly used by combat medics (military environment) and EMS (civilian environment). A tourniquet is a device which applies pressure to a limb or extremity in order to limit ‚Äì but not stop ‚Äì the flow of blood. It may be used in emergencies, in surgery, or in post-operative rehabilitation. A simple tourniquet can be made from a stick and a rope (or leather belt), but the use of makeshift tourniquets has been reduced over time due to their ineffectiveness compared to a commercial and professional tourniquet. This may stem the flow of blood, but side effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur.  Types  There are three types of tourniquets: surgical tourniquets, emergency tourniquets, and rehabilitation tourniquets.  Surgical tourniquets  Tourniquet cuff with a tie ribbon stabilizer Tourniquet cuff with a releasable application handle stabilizer Silicone ring tourniquets, or elastic ring tourniquets, are self-contained mechanical devices that do not require any electricity, wires or tubes. The tourniquet comes in a variety of sizes. To determine the correct product size, the patient's limb circumference at the desired occlusion location should be measured, as well as their blood pressure to determine the best model. Once the correct model is selected, typically two sterile medical personnel will be needed to apply the device. Unlike with the pneumatic tourniquet, the silicone ring tourniquet should be applied after the drapes have been placed on the patient. This is due to the device being completely sterile. The majority of the devices require a two-man operation (with the exception of the extra large model): # One person is responsible for holding the patient's limb, the other will place the device on the limb (with the extra-large there are two people needed). # Application: ## Place the elastic ring tourniquet on the hand/foot. Take care to ensure that all the fingers/toes are enclosed within the device. ## The handles of the tourniquet should be positioned medial-lateral on the upper extremity or posterior-anterior on the lower extremity. ## The person applying the device should start rolling the device while the individual responsible for the limb should hold the limb straight and maintain axial traction. ## Once the desired occlusion location is reached, the straps can be cut off or tied just below the ring. ## A window can be cut or the section of stockinet can be completely removed. ## Once the surgery is completed the device is cut off with a supplied cutting card. The elastic ring tourniquet follows similar recommendations noted for pneumatic tourniquet use: # It should not be used on a patient's limb for more than 120 minutes. # The tourniquet should not be placed on the ulnar/peroneal nerve. # The silicone ring device cannot be used on patients with blood problems such as DVT, edema, etc. # A patient suffering from skin lesions or a malignancy should use this type of tourniquet.  Emergency tourniquets  Silicone ring auto- transfusion tourniquet = The silicone ring auto-transfusion tourniquet (SRT/ATT/EED), or surgical auto-transfusion tourniquet (HemaClear), is a simple to use, self-contained, mechanical tourniquet that consists of a silicone ring, stockinet, and pull straps that results in the limb being exsanguinated and occluded within seconds of application. The tourniquet can be used for limb procedures in the operating room, or in emergency medicine as a means to stabilize a patient until further treatment can be applied.EmergencyEED = Combat application tourniquet = The combat application tourniquet (CAT) was developed by Ted Westmoreland. It is used by the U.S. and coalition militaries to provide soldiers a small and effective tourniquet in field combat situations. It is also used in the UK by NHS ambulance services, along with some UK fire and rescue services. The unit utilizes a windlass with a locking mechanism and can be self-applied. The CAT has been adopted by military and emergency personnel around the world.Reference: \\"Testing of Battlefield Tourniquets\\" by Dr. Thomas Walters, US Army Institute of Surgical Research, presented at Advanced Technology Applications for Combat Casualty Care 2004 (ATACCC) Conference, published in the Conference Proceedings, Aug 16-18 2004, St. Petersburg, FL. http://www.usaccc.org/ataccc/index.jsp  History  Petit tourniquet engraving from 1798 During Alexander the Great‚Äôs military campaigns in the fourth century BC, tourniquets were used to stanch the bleeding of wounded soldiers. Romans used them to control bleeding, especially during amputations. These tourniquets were narrow straps made of bronze, using only leather for comfort. Sir Gilbert Blane advocates the issue of a tourniquet to each man in battle. In 1718, French surgeon Jean Louis Petit developed a screw device for occluding blood flow in surgical sites. Before this invention, the tourniquet was a simple garrot, tightened by twisting a rod (thus its name tourniquet, from tourner = to turn). In 1785 Sir Gilbert Blane advocated that, in battle, each Royal Navy sailor should carry a tourniquet: > It frequently happens that men bleed to death before assistance can be > procured, or lose so much blood as not to be able to go through an > operation. In order to prevent this, it has been proposed, and on some > occasions practised, to make each man carry about him a garter, or piece of > rope yarn, in order to bind up a limb in case of profuse bleeding. If it be > objected, that this, from its solemnity may be apt to intimidate common men, > officers at least should make use of some precaution, especially as many of > them, and those of the highest rank, are stationed on the quarter deck, > which is one of the most exposed situations, and far removed from the > cockpit, where the surgeon and his assistants are placed. This was the cause > of the death of my friend Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his > knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the > limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by > loss of blood in carrying him so far. As the Admiral on these occasions > allowed me the honour of being at his side, I carried in my pocket several > tourniquets of a simple construction, in case that accidents to any person > on the quarter deck should have required their use. In the 2000s, the silicon ring tourniquet, or elastic ring tourniquet, was developed by Noam Gavriely, a professor of medicine and former emergency physician. The tourniquet consists of an elastic ring made of silicone, stockinet, and pull straps made from ribbon that are used to roll the device onto the limb. The silicone ring tourniquet exsanguinates the blood from the limb while the device is being rolled on, and then occludes the limb once the desired occlusion location is reached. Unlike the historical mechanical tourniquets, the device reduces the risk of nerve paralysis. The surgical tourniquet version of the device is completely sterile, and provides improved surgical accessibility due to its narrow profile that results in a larger surgical field. It has been found to be a safe alternative method for most orthopedic limb procedures, but it does not completely replace the use of contemporary tourniquet devices. More recently the silicone ring tourniquet has been used in the fields of emergency medicine and vascular procedures. After World War II, the US military reduced use of the tourniquet because the time between application and reaching medical attention was so long that the damage from stopped circulation was worse than that from blood loss. Since the beginning of the 21st century, US authorities have resuscitated its use in both military and non-military situations because treatment delays have been dramatically reduced. The Virginia State Police and police departments in Dallas, Philadelphia and other major cities provide tourniquets and other advanced bandages. In Afghanistan and Iraq, only 2 percent of soldiers with severe bleeding died compared with 7 percent in the Vietnam War, in part because of the combination of tourniquets and rapid access to doctors. Between 2005 and 2011, tourniquets saved 2,000 American lives from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In civilian use, emerging practices include transporting tourniquetted patients even before emergency responders arrive and including tourniquets with defibrillators for emergency use.

It is a rocky spur roughly half a kilometer in length, with an elevation of 1,900 meters above sea level at its summit. The site was first discovered in 1926 by Louis Leakey during excavations at the nearby Nakuru Burial Site, and Mary Leakey conducted the first major excavations between 1937 and 1938. There are two distinct areas of occupation at Hyrax Hill: one which was occupied during the Pastoral Neolithic and late Iron Age, and one which was occupied by the Sirikwa earlier in the Iron Age. Hyrax Hill is named after the hyrax, a small mammal that lives in rocky areas. Hyraxes were once common in the rocky crevasses of Hyrax Hill, but their numbers have dropped in recent years due to the rapid urbanization of the surrounding area. Hyrax Hill is the location of Hyrax Hill Prehistoric Site and Museum. History of excavation Mary and Louis Leakey excavating at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania Louis Leakey discovered the remains of prehistoric settlements at Hyrax Hill while excavating the nearby Nakuru Burial in 1926. He did not excavate it at the time because he believed it to be a recent occupation, and was busy working at several other sites. Louis Leakey returned to the area in 1937 with his wife, Mary Leakey. It was Mary Leakey who began major excavations at Hyrax Hill. She excavated and named both Site I and Site II between 1937 and 1938. With no carbon dating technology available, dating the sites was difficult at the time. Leakey mistakenly described the Iron Age \\"Sirikwa Holes\\" as a pre-Iron Age village with \\"pit-dwellings.\\" Excavations at the site were not undertaken again until after Hyrax Hill was obtained by the National Museums of Kenya in 1965, at which time one of the Sirikwa holes was fully excavated by Ron Clark and museum staff for display at the museum. Location and environment Hyrax Hill is located near Lake Nakuru. 5000 to 6000 years ago, during the occupation of Site I, a wetter climate meant that lake levels were as much as 100 meters higher than their present levels. Hyrax Hill was a peninsula at this time, which jutted out into the north side of the lake. The occupants would have had access to a steady supply of fresh water, as well as fish. Mary Leakey identified the ancient rocky beach of the lake in her 1938 excavations. The early occupation of Site I lies directly on the ancient beach, and she was able to use this and relative dating to date this portion of the site. Lake levels began to drop starting 3500 years ago, and the area became a more open savanna grassland. The drier environment was well suited to the pastoralism used by the later Sirikwan inhabitants of Site II. Archaeology=Site I \\"Site I\\" is the area of Hyrax Hill that was occupied during the Neolithic and late Iron Age. Although the early occupation of the site 5000 years ago is frequently referred to as the \\"Neolithic\\" (a trend started by Louis and Mary Leakey during the first excavations in the area), evidence has yet to be found for the cultivation of crops or raising of animals at the early occupation of Site I at Hyrax Hill. The Iron Age portion of the site dates to around 200 years ago, and consists of several stone enclosures and a large midden. Directly under this layer was an earlier Neolithic cemetery. The Neolithic cemetery consisted of several low burial mounds formed out of large blocks of stone. Many of the individuals buried at the site were dismembered. The occupants of this period of the site manufactured distinctive ground stone bowls, and many were found associated with female burials in the Neolithic cemetery at Hyrax Hill and other sites in the area. The bowls from Hyrax Hill are round or oblong, particularly shallow, and made from an easily accessed local variety of stone. Because these bowls were so distinctive at many sites in the Rift Valley, archaeologists created the term \\"Stone Bowl Culture\\" to encompass the Neolithic culture they were believed to represent. The term \\"Stone Bowl Culture\\" is not widely used today, having been supplanted by \\"Savanna Pastoral Neolithic\\", a culture which Christopher Ehret indicates was likely produced by early Cushitic settlers. In Kenya, the broader term \\"Pastoral Neolithic\\" refers to sites archaeological containing a Later Stone Age lithic industry, predominant livestock husbandry, and ceramic vessels. The ceramic type known as \\"Nderit ware\\" is found at Site I. These are rounded vessels with a highly textured surface of wedge-shaped impressions, which are commonly found at Neolithic sites in eastern Africa. They resemble baskets. Site II \\"Site II\\" lies on the north-western side of Hyrax hill, opposite from Site I. It was occupied earlier in the Iron Age than Site I. Radiocarbon dates have found that Site II was occupied between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries AD. Site II was occupied by the Sirikwa, a later group of cattle pastoralists. The main feature of this site is a series of thirteen sandy bowl-shaped depressions and mounds. These depressions, called Sirikwa Holes, were deliberately constructed as pens for securing cattle, and the low mounds that are adjacent to these hollows were created from heaping dung and refuse outside the pen. The remains of cattle, goats, and sheep have been found at Site II, many of which show cut-marks and signs of human use. John Sutton's excavations in 1985 found the mandible of an equine species, possibly a donkey. Excavations in 1990 identified the cattle as likely belonging to the Zebu species. Further analysis showed that female cows were only slaughtered until after lactating age, indicating an emphasis on milk production. This excavation also found the remains of a domesticated dog, the first ever found at a Sirikwa site. Scavenging domesticated dogs possibly account for the carnivore gnaw-marks that have been found on bones at the site.Zebu cattle similar to those that would have been raised by the Sirikwa. Site II was mistakenly identified as a late Neolithic site when it was first excavated, and Mary Leakey assigned it to the Neolithic \\"Gumban B\\" culture which Louis Leakey had identified from earlier excavations in the area. Few Iron-Age sites had been excavated in the area, and there was no reliable way for Mary Leakey to date the site. Few iron artifacts have ever been found at Site II, which further confused the actual date. Scattered obsidian flakes similar to those used by earlier cultures were also found at the site. It is unknown whether these were made by the inhabitants of Site II, or the earlier inhabitants of Site I. The pottery found at Site II is \\"Lanet ware\\" dated to the Iron Age. It consists of tall beakers with simple rims, rounded bottoms, and decoration made from cord impressions. These occasionally have small spouts and rounded handles. The pottery has a distinctive \\"sand paper\\" finish, and some vessels have been found with red slips. Other archaeological areas Archaeological remains have been found on the hill outside of Sites I and II. At the top of the hill is a cleared area, possibly created by the later inhabitants of Site I or the inhabitants of Site II. Mary Leakey described it as possibly being a stone circle or fort. Two bao boards are carved into rock outcroppings at the north side of the hill. One is only partially preserved, but both appear to be a two-row version of the game rather than a four-row version. They are thought to be associated with the Site II Sirikwa habitation. Gumban nomenclature While investigating archaeological sites in Kenya, Louis Leakey identified early sites belonging to the Neolithic period. He named these \\"Gumban\\" sites, after small forest-dwellers in kikuyu mythology that were said to have lived in the area before the Kikuyu. He further broke the category down into the \\"Gumban A\\" and \\"Gumban B\\" variations. Leakey did not intend to imply that the Gumba were the creators of the Neolithic sites, but intended the term to broadly refer to a culture that predated the modern inhabitants of the area. Leakey used this term while excavating the nearby Nakuru burial site, and Mary Leakey continued the usage when excavating Hyrax Hill. The name has since fallen out of use, due to its misleading nature. \\"Gumban B\\" was originally identified as a Neolithic culture, but it was often mistakenly used to refer to sites that are now correctly dated to the Iron-Age. There was no reliable way to date the sites at the time, and Louis Leakey accidentally included Iron-Age pottery sherds among the \\"Gumban B\\" artifacts of the pre-Iron-Age Nakuru Burial site. Thus, Iron-Age sites like Site II of Hyrax hill became associated with Neolithic \\"Gumban B\\" sites until a clearer chronology of the area was developed. The pottery types found at Hyrax Hill was originally were originally named \\"Gumban A\\" and \\"Gumban B\\" by Louis and Mary Leakey when they were first discovered at Hyrax Hill and the Nakuru Burial Site. These terms fell out of use along with the term \\"Gumban\\". The ceramic type formerly known as \\"Gumban A\\" is now known as \\"Nderit ware\\" and the type formerly known as \\"Gumban B\\" is now known as \\"Lanet ware.\\" Both these names refer to the locations that the ceramic types were first identified.

Named for counties in Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-57 was laid down on 24 October 1943 at Neville Island, Pennsylvania by the Dravo Corporation and launched on 4 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Edward Mays. Placed in \\"reduced commission\\" on 1 January 1944 at her builder's yard, she went to New Orleans, Louisiana where she was commissioned on 15 January 1944. Service history=Voyage to England, February‚ÄìMay 1944 Following her fitting out at Pensacola and shakedown training out of Panama City, Florida LST-57 returned to New Orleans where she took on board and a cargo of diesel fuel. Clearing the \\"Crescent City\\" on 25 February 1944 LST-57 proceeded independently to New York City. Spending five days there (during which time she embarked two Navy doctors and 40 corpsmen) the tank landing ship proceeded to Davisville, Rhode Island where the tank deck was loaded with 358 tons of pontoons: \\"no better a cargo for the sub-infested Atlantic,\\" observed the ship's historian wryly. After an overnight stay at Boston, LST-57 joined a convoy bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Reaching her destination on 21 March, the tank landing ship remained there until the 29th. Sailing thence with \\"slow convoy\\" SC-156, LST-57 began her voyage to the Old World, although for a time her crew wondered if they would ever get away from the New. Three events occurred before she even left Halifax harbor that presaged an \\"eventful\\" crossing. The wait for a frozen boat davit to thaw delayed recovery of one of the ship's landing craft, a tug ripped a hole in her port bow several feet above the waterline, and a steering casualty stopped her a few hundred feet from the antisubmarine nets causing the ship to-block the convoy sortie until it could be corrected. Once at sea, LST-57 and the convoy encountered dense fog that rendered visibility difficult for more than 48 hours, and another LST nearly collided with the ship. The fact that the other ship was known to be carrying ammunition \\"didn't quiet anyone's nerves,\\" as LST-57s' chronicler, recounts. No sooner had the fog cleared but an ice field was encountered. Two emergency changes of course to avoid the ice caused the convoy \\"...to lose all semblance of order...for several hours.\\" Preoccupied by accidents and natural hazards, LST-57's crewmen almost forgot the war until rudely reminded them. At 02:28 on 6 April the U-boat torpedoed two merchantmen on LST-57's port side. The tank landing ship went to general quarters, but did not engage the enemy or participate in the rescue operation. One of the escorts, , sank U-302, and ships closer to the two victims picked up survivors. LST-57 reached Milford Haven, Wales, on 14 April, only to be directed to proceed to Southampton immediately. She overtook a slow coastal convoy to that port and reached her destination on the 16th, mooring at the Fawley oil dock, downstream from Southampton, to discharge the diesel oil cargo. Later, at Southampton the tank deck was unloaded and the LCT launched. Over the next few weeks, LST-57 visited Plymouth, Falmouth, Dartmouth, Salcombe, and Brixham as planning for the invasion of the continent of Europe proceeded apace. On 2 June, at Brixham, LST-57 took on board six tanks, several \\"Long Toms\\" (155-millimeter guns), and \\"...a handful of Army quartermasters and a reserve company of airborne infantry. It was a conglomeration,\\" noted the tank landing ship's chronicler, \\"but the Army was careful in its loading and did not want to lose an LST full of one type of soldier.\\" Invasion of France, June‚ÄìNovember 1944 After bad weather forced the invasion force to postpone its scheduled departure on 4 June, LST-57 started toward France the following day as part of a slow convoy. LST-57 discharged her initial cargo and passengers at Utah Beach in the American sector of the Normandy Beachhead. Over the ensuing months, she visited all five of the Allied beaches: \\"Utah,\\" \\"Omaha,\\" \\"Juno,\\" \\"Gold,\\" and \\"Sword,\\" delivering vital supplies and reinforcements from a variety of ports in southern England. After the Allied breakout at Saint-L√¥ late in July, the ship also carried supplies to the beach at Saint-Michel-en- Gr√®ve on the Brittany Peninsula. After November, LST-57 transported men and equipment from England to the French ports of Cherbourg, Rouen, and Le Havre and returned to England with Allied casualties and German prisoners of war. Return to the US, April‚ÄìJuly 1945 On 16 April 1945 LST-57 stood out of Plymouth, England, on her way back to the United States. Steaming by way of Hampton Roads, Virginia, the tank landing ship reached Houston, Texas in mid- May. She carried out substantial repairs at the Brown Shipbuilding Company at Houston before proceeding to Gulfport, Mississippi to load cargo. Then, following a brief repair period at Mobile, Alabama, LST-57 set sail for the Panama Canal on 2 July. After transiting the canal, she departed the west coast of Panama on 13 July. The tank landing ship touched briefly at Manzanillo, Mexico before heading out across the Pacific Ocean. Pacific Ocean, August‚ÄìDecember 1945 LST-57 arrived in Pearl Harbor on 2 August but resumed her voyage west on the 9th. While en route from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands, she received word of the Japanese capitulation. The tank landing ship arrived at Eniwetok on 21 August but tarried there only three days before getting underway on the 24th. She discharged cargo at Guam and then returned to sea on her way to the Philippines. In September and October, LST-57 visited Leyte and San Fernando in the Philippines before setting out for Japan to support the postwar occupation. In November and December, she made a circuitous voyage from Hiro Wan, Japan, to Saipan and Peleliu, returning to Tokyo on 27 December 1945. 1946‚Äì1956 Decommissioned on 24 January 1946, LST-57 was turned over to the Shipping Control Administrator, Japan (SCAJAP), for operation by a Japanese crew, under the designator Q-Q28. Returned to the Navy in November 1950, LST-57 was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Tacoma, Washington on 9 November 1950 where she remained in reserve into the mid-1950s. Though named USS Armstrong County (LST-57) on 1 July 1955, she never performed any active service under that name. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 September 1955 and she was sunk as a target the following year. LST-57 was awarded one battle star for her World War II service.

The duo's music combines folk, electronica and other influences. History The band was formed in 2000 by Rossen and Nicolaus, who were friends and New York University (NYU) roommates. They created music from collected samples, assembled into songs and recorded with unlicensed recording software and a microphone borrowed from their neighbor, Chris Taylor, who later became Rossen's bandmate in Grizzly Bear, as well as Department of Eagles' producer and recording engineer.Official Bio , Department of Eagles Website, Retrieved on July 22, 2009. Initially, Rossen and Nicolaus planned on distributing their dorm room beats-and-samples CD only among friends, but they ended up releasing some of these early tracks on two limited-edition vinyl singles on California-based independent label Isota Records. They recorded additional tracks for these singles and for their debut album with producer Jeff Saltzman, the father of a friend from NYU. Saltzman went on to produce Hot Fuss, the debut CD by The Killers. During this period the duo went by the tongue-in-cheek name Whitey on the Moon UK. However, to avoid a dispute with a San Francisco-based band of the same name (excepting the UK), they changed their name to \\"Department of Eagles\\" before the release of their debut full-length CD. The Whitey on the Moon UK LP saw release on Isota Records in 2003. In 2004 Rossen began writing more folk-based material and experimenting with layered vocals, and in late 2004 he joined Grizzly Bear. The following summer they recorded their first album as a four-piece, Yellow House. In the meantime, Fred Nicolaus continued to write and pass demos to Rossen. In January 2006, the band began work on a second LP in Berkeley, CA. Though the sessions were ultimately deemed a failure, much of the resulting material can be found on the Archive 2003-2006 collection, released in 2010. In 2007 the band began a second attempt at a new record in New York, this time with Daniel's Grizzly Bear bandmates Christopher Bear, and Chris Taylor. This album, In Ear Park, was released by 4AD on October 7, 2008. They described the new material as sounding like Van Dyke Parks, Randy Newman, and Paul McCartney. In 2008, the duo recorded a cover of JoJo's song Too Little Too Late as a birthday present for Grizzly Bear frontman Edward Droste. They played No One Does It Like You live on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on October 1, 2008. Their name is a reference to artist Marcel Broodthaers' Institutional Critique.

Calissons have a texture similar to that of marzipan, but with a fruitier, distinctly melon-like flavour. Calissons are often almond-shaped and are typically about two inches in length. Calissons are traditionally associated with the town of Aix-en- Provence, France; consequently, most of the world supply of calissons is still made in the Provence region. History The calisson is believed to have its origins in medieval Italy. Among the first known references to calissons was in Martino di Canale's Chronicle of the Venetians in 1275. An earlier 12th century text written in Medieval Latin used the word calisone to refer to a cake made with almonds and flour. Yet another candy that is thought to be a relative of the modern calisson is kalitsounia, which was made with marzipan, nuts, and spices such as cinnamon and cloves and was found in places occupied by the Venetians, such as Crete. Some trace the introduction of calissons to Provence around the mid-15th century at the second wedding of King Rene of Anjou. Others suggest that it was not introduced in its modern form until the 16th century, as this was when almonds became an established crop in Aix-en- Provence. Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) The calisson status has been protected in France since 1991 which means that local manufacturers need to follow strict methods to make them and that only applies in France. During 14 years, the French Union of Calisson makers were not able to get the international rights over the calisson as they could not agree on the exact ingredients of the recipe. To prevent foreign companies from using the Calisson d'Aix name, the union applied for the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in 2015 but it was already too late.

The Federation organises a wide range of activities and creates opportunities for an international exchange of knowledge and experience in the professional field. Among these activities, the most prominent event is the annual congress devoted to a topical theme. History IFHP was founded in London in 1913 by Ebenezer Howard. Howard was the father of the 'garden city', a combined housing and planning concept designed to solve the problems of ever-expanding metropolitan cities and to create better living conditions for the people. Howard had established the Town and Country Planning Association in 1899 to promote these 'garden city' ideals. The establishment of IFHP with its principle of international exchange of knowledge and experience was a significant step forward for the planning profession, as the international arm of the garden city movement, enhancing the promotion of housing and planning and improving the general standard of the profession.

G. Wells wrote about the socialist future in the period 1901-1908, while he was engaged in an effort to reform the Fabian Society. Background As a result of Wells's earlier books and articles, he was \\"bombarded with requests for pieces on socialism.\\"David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 101. Many of the chapters of New Worlds for Old are reworked versions of these pieces. He told an American publisher that his intended audience was intelligent young people, especially those living in the United States.David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 102. Argument New Worlds for Old identifies two \\"Main Generalizations of Socialism\\": (1) \\"The ideas of the private individual rights of the parent and of his isolated responsibility for his children are harmfully exaggerated in the contemporary world.\\"H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. III, ¬ß5. (2) \\"The idea of the private ownership of things and the rights of owners is enormously and mischievously exaggerated in the contemporary world.\\"H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. IV, ¬ß7. Wells advocates the replacement of a \\"social system, based on Private Ownership\\" with one based on the \\"spirit of service,\\" arguing that this will be more productive as well as more just.H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. V (\\"The Spirit of Gain and the Spirit of Service\\"). He devotes several chapters to addressing objections to socialism, then analyzes the history of socialism. Wells places the origins of socialism in \\"a disconnected series of protests against the extreme theories of Individualism and Individualist Political Economy\\" and notes that the word dates from 1835; in its initial phase, he says, it was \\"immediately revolutionary\\" and teemed with \\"rash, suggestive schemes.\\"H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. X, ¬ß1. This early phase was ended by Karl Marx, who, influenced by evolutionary thinking, \\"for the first time viewed our age of individualist industrial development, not as a possible permanent condition of humanity, but as something unstable and in motion, as an economic process.\\"H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. XI, ¬ß1. But Wells rejects the \\"revolutionary socialism\\" of Marx as flawed by an exaggeration of the economic factor, an invidious concept of class warfare, and an excessive determinism. In a following chapter, he criticizes the \\"administration socialism\\" of which the Fabians are an example, as excessively bureaucratic in spirit. The label Wells gives to what he advocates is \\"constructive socialism,\\" which is to be realized \\"through the operation of a collective mind that must by its nature be constructive and enterprising, because only through the creation of such a mind can Socialism be brought about.\\"H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. XIII, ¬ß1. For Wells, socialism is more in the nature of a religion than a political movement. Near the end of New Worlds for Old, he writes: \\"Socialism is a moral and intellectual process, let me in conclusion reiterate that. Only secondarily and incidentally does it sway the world of politics. It is not a political movement; it may engender political movements, but it can never become a political movement; any political body, any organization whatever, that professes to stand for Socialism, makes an altogether too presumptuous claim. . . . There can be no pontifical Socialism; the theory lives and grows. It springs out of the common sanity of mankind.\\"H. G. Wells, New Worlds for Old, Ch. XV, ¬ß2. Reception New Worlds for Old was very successful, and went through many editions; it was reprinted five times over the next six years and later went through two revisions.David Sherborne, H. G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 185. Leopold Bloom cites it in the \\"Night Town\\" section of James Joyce's Ulysses. The book influenced an entire generation of British socialists.Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H. G. Wells: A Biography (Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 400. It was praised by William Archer, John Galsworthy, Ray Lankester, Joseph Conrad, and many others; in a review, Arnold Bennett called it a masterly work.David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 102.

It was produced by Friedrich Deckel AG, Munich (Germany). A typical Compound shutter may have settings for T (Time), B (Bulb), and times from 1 second down to 1/100th or less. Unlike later mechanical shutters such as the Compur which use a clockwork mechanism, shutter timing is achieved by releasing air from a small cylinder typically mounted horizontally at the top of the shutter through a small aperture. A cam turned by the shutter speed dial positions a piston in the cylinder to provide the correct exposure. When the shutter release is pressed the shutter opens and air in the cylinder is gradually released, letting the piston move; it closes the shutter when it reaches the end of its travel. The piston travels for a very short distance at the higher speeds, making their accuracy very sensitive to the precise manufacturing of the cam; lower speeds are more reliably accurate.

Among the bhikkhunis she was regarded as the foremost in analysing the previous reincarnations of beings and their previous karma, as described in the Jataka of the Pali Canon. Before they both entered the sangha, she was the wife of Mahakassapa, the arahant who led the sangha after the paranibbana of the Buddha and his two chief disciples Sariputta and Mahamoggallana.  Early years  Pipphali Kassapa, as he was born, was adamant that he would not marry, but would become an ascetic. At the continued behest of his parents, he finally agreed to marry in order to please them, on the condition that a girl could be found who conformed to his standards. His parents thus hired eight brahmins to go and find such a girl. At Sagala they found Bhadda Kapilani, the wealthy daughter of a brahmin, who was aged sixteen and four years younger than Pipphali Kassapa. Her parents agreed to the marriage proposal, but Bhadda Kapilani also did not wish to marry, as she too wished for a religious life as a female ascetic. Pipphali, believing that the brahmins would not be successful, was unhappy with the brahmins' success and sent a letter to the Bhadda Kapilani stating, \\"Bhadda, please marry someone else of equal status and live a happy home life with him. As for myself, I shall become an ascetic. Please do not have regrets.\\" Bhadda Kapilani independently sent him a similar letter, but both sets of parents, suspecting such an attempt to scupper the marriage would occur, arranged for both letters to be intercepted and replaced by letters of welcome. As a result Bhadda was taken to Magadha and the young couple were married. In accordance with their ascetic aspirations, they agreed to a life of celibacy. In accordance with this, they laid a garland of flowers between them before they went to bed, determined not to yield to sensual desire. This young wealthy couple lived comfortably and happily for many years. As long as Pipphali's parents lived, they did not even have to look after the estate's farms. But when his parents died, they were entrusted with the large property. One day when Pipphali was inspecting the fields, he saw in shocking clarity what he had not seen before. He observed that when the soil was plowed, many birds gathered and picked the worms from the furrows. This sight, common to a farmer, startled him. He realised that his wealth, generated by the produce of his fields, was created with the suffering of other living beings. He asked one of his laborers: \\"Who will have to bear the consequences of such an action?\\" to which the laborer replied, \\"You yourself, sir.\\" Worried by the insight into karmic retribution, he went home and reflected: \\"If I have to carry along the burden of guilt for that killing, what use is all that wealth to me? It will be better if I give it all to Bhadda and go forth into the ascetic's life.\\" However at the same time, Bhadda had a similar experience. She noticed that when sesame seeds were left in the open to dry, various birds ate the insects that had been attracted by the seeds. When she asked her servants who was morally responsible for the violent death of so many creatures, she was told that it was hers. Bhadda thought: \\"If even by that much I commit a wrong, I won't be able to lift my head above the ocean of rebirths, even in a thousand lives. As soon as Pipphali returns, I shall hand over everything to him and leave to take up the ascetic life.\\"  Renouncement  When both found each other in agreement, Bhadda and Pipphali bought pale yellow cloth and clay bowls from the bazaar, and then shaved each other's heads. They freed their servants and continued on their way. While walking, Pipphali went ahead while Bhadda followed behind him. Worried that observers would believe that they were attached to each other, they parted in their religious search. Bhadda journeyed to Savatthi where she attended to the discourses of Gautama Buddha at the Jetavana monastery. As the order of nuns (Bhikkhuni sangha) did not exist at the time, she practiced at a nunnery of non-Buddhist female ascetics nearby. She lived there for five years until she could obtain ordination as a bhikkhuni. Soon afterwards, she was able to attain arahanthood. As an arahant bhikkhuni, Bhadda spent most of her time in the education of the younger nuns and instructing them in monastic discipline (Vinaya). The Buddha praised Bhadda as being the foremost among the nuns who could recollect past lives.  Jataka  The Jataka documents many accounts of the past reincarnations of the Bhadda Kapilani. In many of these, she is related to Kasyapa. At the time of the former Vipassƒ´ Buddha, they were a poor brahmin couple, to the extent that they had only one single upper garment, so that only one of them could leave the hut at a given time. In this story, the brahmin was called \\"he with one garment\\" (ekasataka). In their life as that poor brahmin couple, both had listened to the sermons of the Vipassƒ´ Buddha. Through listening to that Buddha's teaching, the brahmin wanted to offer his only garment to the sangha. But after he had so resolved, he pondered that as it was his and his wife's only garment, he thought that he should consult her. However he went ahead and offered the garment to the monks. Having done so, he clapped his hands and joyfully shouted \\"I have vanquished! I have vanquished!\\". When the king, who had listened to the sermon behind a curtain, heard what had occurred, he sent sets of garments to the brahmin and made him the court chaplain, ending the couple's poverty. Bhadda was once the mother of a brahmin youth who was a pupil of the future Gautama Buddha and wanted to become an ascetic. Kasyapa was her husband and Ananda was their son. Bhadda wanted her son to know the worldly life before being allowed to become an ascetic. This came to young brahman drastically when his teacher's mother fell in love with him and contemplated killing her son. This encounter with passion gave him a deep revulsion for worldly life, and earned his parents gave him permission to go forth as an ascetic. Another time Kasyapa and Bhadda had been the brahmin parents of four sons who in the future were to be Gautama Buddha, Anuruddha, Sariputra and Mahamoggallana. All four had wanted to become ascetics and despite early resistance from their parents were allowed to so. In one previous life Bhadda was the wife of a landowner. One day, having argued with her sister-in-law, she begrudged her the merit of offering alms to a Pratyekabuddha. She took the Pratyekabuddha's bowl, filling it with mud. She felt remorse, took the bowl back, washed it, filled it with delicious and fragrant food and offered it to the Pratyekabuddha. As a result, in her next life she was wealthy, but her body was odorous. Her husband, later to be Kasyapa, could not bear this and left her. In preparation of disposing of her property, she had her ornaments melted down and formed into a golden brick and went to monastery and donated it to the construction of a stupa in honor of the recently deceased Kassapa Buddha. After she had done that, her body became fragrant again, and Kasyapa, took her back. Two lives before her final existence, Bhadda was queen of Varanasi and used to support several Pratyekabuddhas. Deeply moved by their sudden death, she left the royal life and lived a one of meditation in the Himalayas. She was reborn in a Brahma- world, as was Kasyapa. After the end of the long life-span they were reborn as Pipphali Kassapa and Bhadda Kapilani.

Currently the club plays in Serie D. History Marsala was founded in 1912: it is also referred to as lilybetani, after Lilybaeum, the ancient name of Marsala during the Roman period. After the First World War it was entered into the Coppa Federale Siciliana which was competed amongst the top Sicilian sides Marsala, Palermo, Messinese and Catanese. Marsala lost in the semi-finals heavily against eventual winners Palermo. The first professional appearance for the club is dated 1942, when the team ended round N of Serie C in sixth place. Since then, Marsala played 28 other times at the Serie C level, narrowly missing promotion to Serie B in 1960 (second placed in the round C) and launching several young players which then obtained notoriety even at the worldwide level such as, in more recent times, Marco Materazzi and Patrice Evra. The team declared bankruptcy in 2000, after a Serie C1 season ended with a relegation. A new team, Associazione Sportiva Marsala 2000, was founded as relocation of existing Eccellenza club Don Bosco Partinico. The team immediately promoted to Serie D, but was cancelled in 2004 immediately after another relegation after losing playoffs to Ariano Irpino, again because of financial troubles. Following the 2006‚Äì07 season, four teams were representing the city of Marsala: * U.S.D. Petrosino Marsala, an Eccellenza team officially based in Petrosino but playing its home matches in Marsala; * S.C. Marsala A.S.D., a minor local club formerly known as Bosco 1970 that were crowned Promozione champions in 2007, being therefore elected to play Eccellenza the following season; * U.S. Kennedy J.F., a Prima Categoria club hailing from the local frazione of Birgi, home of the Trapani-Birgi Airport, that gained promotion to Promozione in 2007; * and S.C. Marsala 1912, the direct and legal heir of the historical local club, re-registered to the Italian Football Federation in 2006, which played and won Seconda Categoria in 2006‚Äì2007. In June 2007, after failing to find an agreement with Sport Club Marsala, Marsala 1912 agreed for a merger with Kennedy Birgi. The new club assumed the denomination of A.S.D. S.C. Marsala 1912 and took part to the 2007‚Äì08 regionally organized Promozione league. In 2008‚Äì09, Marsala 1912 won promotion to Eccellenza through play- offs, after defeating Palermo-based club Sporting Arenella in the final, so they played in the Italian 6th tier the following season.

Rich explains that when he was in college, a werewolf bit him on the rear when he and his buddies were climbing over a gate to escape. They plan to kill the Alpha werewolf, allowing him to be cured (Betas like himself can be cured by killing the Alpha if they have not taken a human life). Much to their shock, they find his best friend from College is the Alpha wolf, who forced him to transform to attack her. However, his love for her prevents him from harming her, allowing his human consciousness to take hold and allow him to kill the Alpha. At their wedding, he jokes about something sexual, prompting her to call him a beast.

The Frontier Corps is an umbrella term for two separate organizations: FC NWFP stationed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province and now including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas), and FC Balochistan stationed in Balochistan province. Each subdivision is headed by a seconded inspector general, who is a Pakistan Army officer of at least major-general rank, although the force itself is under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. With a total manpower of approximately 80,000, the task of the Frontier Corps is to help local law enforcement, and to carry out border patrol and anti- smuggling operations. Some of the FC's constituent units such as the Chitral Scouts, the Khyber Rifles, Swat Levies, the Kurram Militia, the Tochi Scouts, the South Waziristan Scouts, and the Zhob Militia have regimental histories dating back to British colonial times. The Khyber Rifles was in fact regularized during the 1965 war and fought with distinction in Kashmir. History A member of the Khyber Rifles circa 1948. The Frontier Corps was created in 1907 by Lord Curzon, the viceroy of British India, in order to organize seven militia and scout units in the tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan: the Khyber Rifles, the Zhob Militia, the Kurram Militia, the Tochi Scouts, the Chagai Militia, the South Waziristan Scouts and the Chitral Scouts. The Frontier Corps was led by an \\"inspecting officer\\" who was a British officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1943 the inspecting officer was upgraded to an Inspector General (an officer with the rank of brigadier), and the corps was expanded with the addition of new units‚Äîthe Second Mahsud Scouts (raised in 1944) and the Pishin Scouts in 1946). After independence in 1947, Pakistan expanded the corps further by creating a number of new units, including the Thal Scouts, the Northern Scouts, the Bajaur Scouts, the Karakoram Scouts, the Kalat Scouts, the Dir Scouts and the Kohistan Scouts. British officers continued to serve in the Frontier Corps up to the early 1950s. The corps was split into two major subdivisions with FC Balochistan incorporating the Zhob Militia, the Sibi Scouts, the Kalat Scouts, the Makran Militia, the Kharan Rifles, the Pishin Scouts, the Chaghai Militia and the First Mahsud Scouts. In 1975 three of the units: the Gilgit Scouts, the Karakoram Scouts and the Northern Scouts; were merged to form a new paramilitary force called the Northern Light Infantry, which is now a full infantry regiment of the Pakistan Army. In the mid-1970s, the Pakistani government used FC Balochistan to counter the terrorists in Balochistan and the force is unpopular among some of the local population who associate them with human rights violations and heavy-handed operations. To improve the image of the corps, it has been involved in the construction of schools and hospitals, although as of late 2004, corps installations in the province were being routinely attacked by terrorists. In the late 1990s, the Frontier Corps played an important role in eliminating opium poppy cultivation from Dir District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In 2007, after the collapse of truce agreements between the Pakistani government and local militants, the Frontier Corps, teamed with regular Pakistani military units, conducted incursions into tribal areas controlled by the militants. The effort produced a series of bloody and clumsy confrontations. Miller, Greg, \\"U.S. military aid to Pakistan misses its Al Qaeda target\\", Los Angeles Times, November 5, 2007, accessed November 7, 2007 On August 30, about 250 Pakistani troops, mostly from the Frontier Corps, surrendered to militants without a fight. In early November, most were released in exchange for 25 militants held by the Pakistan Army. There is a widespread consensus among United States government military and intelligence experts that the Frontier Corps are the best potential military units against the Islamist militants because its troops are locally recruited, know local languages and understand local cultures. The United States provided more than US$7 billion in military aid to Pakistan from 2002 to 2007, most of which was used to equip the Frontier Corps because it is in the frontline of the fight against the Islamist insurgents. From late 2007, the Pakistani government intended to expand the corps to 100,000 and use it more in fighting Islamist militants, particularly Al-Qaeda, after extensive consultations with the U.S. government and an agreement to start a multi-year effort to bolster it including the establishment of a counterinsurgency training centre. The new US Obama policy for Pakistan is seen as a clear victory for the Pakistan Army lobby in the US. The $1.5billion a year aid recently announced with no strings attached will go a long way in seeing that the Frontier Corps stay at the height of their professional abilities due to new equipment and training. The Corps has also fired occasionally on the U.S.-assisted Afghan Army.\\" Stockman, Farah, \\"Pakistan aid plan facing resistance / $300m requested for paramilitaries\\", Boston Globe, July 22, 2007, accessed November 7, 2007 Role * Perform Border Security duties. * Assist Army/FCNA in the defense of the Country as and when required. * Protect important Communication Centers and Routes. * Undertake Counter Militancy/Criminal/Terrorism Operations on orders. * Assist Law Enforcement Agencies in maintenance of Law and Order. * Safeguard important sites and assets During times of difficulties, the government occasionally gives the FC the power to arrest and detain suspects such as in late 2012 and early 2013 when the Prime Minister of Pakistan granted the FC policing powers.

During World War II, Richmond built more ships than any other shipyard, turning out as many as three ships in a single day. The shipyards are part of the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park, whose the Rosie the Riveter memorial sits on the former grounds of Shipyard #2. Shipyard #3 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Henry J. Kaiser had been building cargo ships for the U.S. Maritime Commission in the late 1930s. When he received orders for ships from the British government, already at war with Nazi Germany, Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard in December 1940. The shipyard legacy continues by virtue of its innovative medical care, which was derived from Kaiser's earlier California Colorado Aqueduct Project insurance and today called Kaiser Permanente. The four Richmond Kaiser Shipyards built 747 ships during World War II, a rate never equaled. Compared to the average ship built elsewhere, Richmond ships were completed in two-thirds the time and at a quarter of the cost. The Liberty ship SS Robert E. Peary was assembled in less than five days as a part of a competition among shipyards. By 1944, the yard routinely needed only a bit more than two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship. By the end of the war the Richmond Shipyards had built $1.8 billion worth of ships. A \\"Wendy the Welder\\" at the shipyard Kaiser and his workers applied mass assembly line techniques to building the ships. This production line technique, bringing pre-made parts together, moving them into place with huge cranes and having them welded together by \\"Rosies\\" (actually \\"Wendy the Welders\\" here in the shipyards), allowed unskilled laborers to do repetitive jobs requiring relatively little training to accomplish. This sped up construction, allowed more workers to be mobilized, and opened jobs to women and minorities. During the war, thousands of men and women worked in this area in hazardous jobs. Actively recruited by Kaiser, they came from all over the United States to swell the population of Richmond from 20,000 to over 100,000 in three years. For many of them, this was the first time they worked, earned money, and faced the problems of working parents: finding day care and housing. Women and minorities entered the workforce in areas previously denied to them. However, they still faced unequal pay, were shunted off into \\"auxiliary\\" unions and still had to deal with prejudice and inequities.Arroyo, Cuahut√©moc (Faculty Mentor: Professor Leon F. Litwack). \\"Jim Crow\\" Shipyards: Black Labor and Race Relations in East Bay Shipyards During World War II. The Berkeley McNair Journal, The UC Berkeley McNair Scholars Program. - Accessed from Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University on August 24, 2007 During the war, labor strikes and sit-down work stoppages eventually led to better conditions. Many workers commuted from other parts of the Bay Area to the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond on the Shipyard Railway, a temporary wartime railway whose trains used cars of the local Key System and whose line extended from a depot in Emeryville to a loop serving all four shipyards.

Founded in the 1970s and 1980s from a partnership between two rival collectors, Heritage is an auctioneer of numismatic collections, comics, fine art, books, luxury accessories, real estate, and memorabilia from film, music, history, and sports.  History  Heritage Auctions was formed from a partnership between two collectors, Steve Ivy and Jim Halperin. In 1967, Ivy dropped out of the University of Texas at Austin to form Steve Ivy Rare Coin Co. in Dallas, Texas. In 1971, Halperin founded New England Rare Coin Galleries while still a freshman at Harvard University and would also later drop out of school. It was Ivy who first formed Heritage Auctions in Dallas in 1976 from his earlier, smaller business. The two friendly rivals often met at industry trade shows and auctions. In 1982, Halperin sold his Boston-based business and moved to Dallas to join Ivy and Heritage Auctions; with him, he brought Marc Emory, a partner who heads what is now part of Heritage's European operations. Greg Rohan joined the company in 1986 and is now president of the company. Besides Ivy, Halperin, Rohan, and Emory, the company includes four other partners: Paul Minshull, Ryan Carroll, Todd Imhof, and Cristiano Bierrenbach. In 1996, the company launched a website to allow the sale and purchase of coins in online auctions. This allowed Heritage to grow its list of potential sellers and buyers. At the urging of Halperin, Heritage began expanding its business model to include collectibles beyond numismatics by first including auctions of comic books in 2001. The company launched a memorabilia department in 2003 and its first auction was valued at about $2 million. In the mid-2000s, Heritage entered the music, entertainment, and film memorabilia market. By April 2006, the auction house was holding its third biennial auction of collectibles that once belonged to famous actors, musicians, directors, and other filmmakers. The collections sold at the auctions included many props, set pieces, and apparel from the sets of notable films and television series in history as well as personal effects of several musical artists. In 2010, Heritage launched its luxury items division, which includes jewelry, handbags, and other accessories. In some instances, rare items from these auctions have sold for over two hundred thousand dollars. By 2013, the auction house was also auctioning modern and contemporary art including works by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, Joan Mitchell, and Edward Ruscha.  Operations  On June 1, 2020, Heritage Auctions consolidated three Dallas-area locations to a new world headquarters in Dallas, located at the northwest corner of West Airport Freeway and Valley View Lane near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The 160,000 square foot facility is located in the DFW Airport international trade zone and will house 450 of the company's 600 employees. The company also has offices in New York located on Park Avenue. Its New York operations are mostly geared towards the fine arts industry. Heritage has a West Coast location in Beverly Hills, California, located on Olympic Boulevard. In 2011, Heritage acquired Greg Martin Auctions in San Francisco, California, forming the auction house's division specializing in weapons and armament. Heritage expanded operations by adding an office in Hong Kong in 2015. In spring 2017, the company formed a Florida branch with offices in Palm Beach. In January 2017, company opened an office in Chicago. Three years later, the base operation was moved from downtown Dallas to a location near the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport as a cost-cutting measure.  Auctions  In October 2011, Heritage auctioned the personal property and movie memorabilia of the actor John Wayne for $5.4 million. The beret he wore in The Green Berets fetched $179,250. The following month, a copy of Action Comics #1, previously owned by Nicolas Cage, sold for $2.16 million, beating the previous record price for the comic of $1.5 million. In December 2015, an auction brought in more than $3 million for memorabilia from Sylvester Stallone's personal collection. A baseball-themed print by American illustrator Norman Rockwell was sold by Heritage Auctions in August 2017 for $1.6 million. The work was a study of Rockwell's Tough Call. In a continuing series of auctions starting in 2018, Heritage Auctions is auctioning a collection of memorabilia from the estate of Neil Armstrong, who died in 2012. The event was the first ever auction of the astronaut's personal collection and is billed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first landing on the Moon in 1969. About 3,000 items were up for auction and, as of October 2019, the auctions have brought in about $12 million. In January 2019, a rare 1943 Lincoln cent sold at Heritage auction for $204,000. The copper coin was created in error in 1943, when copper was meant to be reserved for the war effort. An original 1930 ink-on-paper drawing from the first Tintin comic book, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was sold by Heritage Auctions in June 2019. On November 20, 2019, Blueberry Custard (1961) by Wayne Thiebaud sold at a Heritage auction for $3.225 million, the second highest price brought in for a piece by the artist from Sacramento, California. The next day a near-mint condition Marvel Comics #1 sold for $1.26 million, setting the record for the most expensive Marvel comic sold in a public auction.

Hunting may be regulated informally by unwritten law, self-restraint, a moral code, or by governmental laws.National Shooting Sports Foundation, The Ethical Hunter, brochure p. 6, March 2003, site at The purposes for requiring hunting licenses include the protection of natural treasures, and raising tax revenue (often, but not always, to dedicated funds). History Hunting licenses are millennia old. Amongst the first hunting laws in the Common law tradition was from the time of William the Conqueror (reign in England starting 1066). In the Peterborough Chronicle entry of 1087, The Rime of King William reported in verse that: :Whoever killed a hart or a hind :Should be blinded. Seth Lerner, Inventing English: A Portable History of the English Language, p. 43 (Columbia U. Press 2007), citing Cecily Clark, The Peterborough Chronicle (2nd ed. Clarenden Press 1970). This was because \\"William the Conqueror's moral life lives in the landscape. His control of the forest mirrors his control of the people, and his establishment of hunting laws reveals the dissonance between his love for animals and his contempt for the populace: ...Old English text here is removed. :He loved the wild animals :As if he were their father. Purposes U.S. Forces hunting instructors representing garrisons Ansbach, Bavaria, Rheinland-Pfalz, Stuttgart and Wiesbaden, as well as Ramstein and Spangdahlem Air Bases complete recertification at Grafenwoehr, Baumholder in Germany. Hunting licenses have several purposes. These reasons include: public safety (especially of children, both as hunters and bystanders), regulation and conservation of wild animals, revenue for the sovereign state, and containing the transmission of animal-borne diseases (such as Lyme disease and rabies). The safety issues are especially highlighted in urban areas and shopping districts. For example, after in an incident in November 2012 whereby a man allegedly shot at a deer in a Walmart parking lot in Pennsylvania, he was charged with \\"reckless endangerment, ... hunting without a license, shooting on or across highways and unlawful killing or taking of big game.\\"  Australia  All firearm owners and users in Australia require a firearm's licence, but normally do not require a licence to hunt. Most target species are feral or introduced species, and almost all native animals are protected. Landowners may obtain a \\"Destruction Permit\\" to kill or remove native species when their numbers impact agriculture. Hunting in New South Wales national parks requires a R-licence issued by the Game Council, but (as of mid-2013) this situation has been suspended pending review. Professional hunters are issued what is sometimes referred to as a D-licence, but rather than being a hunting licence this is a category of firearms that includes semi-automatics and large capacity magazines.  Canada  Hunting regulation and licensing falls under both provincial/territorial and federal jurisdiction. The federal government is responsible for protecting migratory birds and nationally significant wildlife habitat, the regulation for endangered species and the international wildlife issues and treaties (i.e. CITES) for Canada.Wildlife BC For example, Migratory Game Bird Hunting licence is issued by the Canadian Wildlife Service,Migratory Bird Hunting Permits for the 2008 Season an agency of Environment Canada. All other matters fall under the provincial/territorial jurisdiction. The use of firearms in hunting is also separated into provincial/territorial and federal jurisdiction. Whereas the Canadian Firearms Program will determine who is eligible for a Possession and Acquisition Licence and issuance of firearm registration certificates, it is the provincial/territorial government's responsibility to regulate when and how the firearms can be used in hunting animals. In Quebec hunter education and licensing is managed by the F√©d√©ration Qu√©b√©coise de la Faune. S√©curit√© Nature, a program managed by the FQF, offers a variety of hunting education courses that allow residents to hunt legally after obtaining their licence and a permit at designated outlets (most hunting & fishing stores, Canadian Tires, etc.) for a fee.  Germany  German hunting license (2004) A German hunting license is a certificate that grants its holder the exercise of hunting within legal ordinances. It is also the precondition to own hunting arms and ammunition (unlimited number of rifles/shotguns and up to two handguns). The actual right to exercise hunting in a specific area is entitled to the respective landowners (if they own an area of more than , otherwise all landowners of a municipality are integrated into an association) who may use their right for themselves or lease it. Depending on size and value of a hunting area a typical leasing rate may vary from about US$10‚Äì100 per acre per year. Additionally the lesse has to pay the landowner any damage by deers, wild hogs etc. The right to hunt is connected to the duty to care for all kind of animals listed by the hunting laws. For several species such as deers plans have to be developed by hunters and authorities, how many animals of a specified class and age may (or have to) be killed within a certain period of time. The purpose of the hunting license is to ensure that only well trained persons may exercise hunting. Applicants must fulfill the following requirements: * Successful completion of a hunting exam, * Certificate of a liability insurance for hunters, * Personal trustworthiness (¬ß 5 German Weapons Act), * Applicants must be at least 16 years for a Youth Hunting License, otherwise 18 years, * Flawless Criminal record. The hunting exam is a test of expertise with a high failure rate. To pass it, each applicant has to participate in a comprehensive, difficult instruction course which consists largely of the areas shooting (shotgun and rifle), theory (esp. weaponry, local wildlife and habitat) and practice. In practice the German system of examination for deer hunters (stalkers) is very much in line with the English DMQ level DSC2. Over the last ten years or so European countries in general have made efforts to harmonise the previously fragmented rules and regulations with parallels being taken from the more difficult UK system.  United States  In the United States, regulation of hunting is primarily performed by state law; additional regulations are imposed through Federal environmental law regarding migratory birds (such as ducks and geese) and endangered species. A map of total hunting licenses purchased in the United States in 2017. Like many licenses, a hunting license is considered a privilege granted by the government, rather than a constitutional right under the Second Amendment.See description of # of tag holders in N.Y. state: .See also Driver's license As a general rule, unprotected pest species are not subject to a hunting license. Vermin may be hunted without a license, or may even be the subject of a bounty paid to the hunter.See, e.g., Learning How to Shoot, or Is There a Gay NRA?, by Erik F. vonHausen, Diversity Rules!, May/June 2007. A Federal law, the Airborne Hunting Act (AHA), was passed in 1971 with the goal of eliminating aerial hunting, that is, shooting wildlife from planes or helicopters.  State licenses  Each state has different standards and paperwork requirements for getting a hunting license. These include the areas, time periods, harvesting techniques, distinctions between species, and a hunting safety course. Licenses to hunt typically go on sale once a year. Some states, such as New York, allow only during a defined single season,See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0701, found at , click on \\"ENV\\", then Article 11. or for a lifetime during such seasons for residents of the state, upon payment of the appropriate fees.See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0702, found at , click on \\"ENV\\", then Article 11. As a general rule, hunting licenses are non-transferable, are a privilege (not a right), and does not allow trespass on private land.See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0703, found at , click on \\"ENV\\", then Article 11. Hunting big game typically requires a tag for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery. Tags may be further restricted to a specific area or wildlife management unit. States with these \\"tags\\" include Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. 49 of the 50 states require a prospective big game hunter take a several-hour course about safety, often termed sportsman education or \\"hunter's safety course\\" in the case of California.See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0713 (3), found at , click on \\"ENV\\". Such jurisdictions also may limit getting a hunting license to adults or may grant a \\"junior\\" license for persons as young as twelve years of age.See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0703 (4), found at , click on \\"ENV\\". Several United States and Canadian provinces have joined in an Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact (IWVC) to control interstate hunting and to punish violators of differing laws.  Federal licenses  Federal law requires the purchase of a duck stamp in order to shoot migratory ducks. They are regulated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. United States law also mandates strict limits on the hunting (\\"taking\\") of endangered species.Endangered Species Act of 1973, Title 16 of the United States Code, ¬ß¬ß 1531-1544For a fuller description of the Endangered Species Act, see that article, or [this portal: http://www.llrx.com/features/esa.htm]. The U.S. is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Bush Administration proposed lifting some restrictions in 2005 (for antelopes), as did the Norwegian Government (for wolves) in the same year.  Exemptions  Both Federal and state laws exempt the following: # Pest species, as noted above, such as rodents. There is a false urban legend that a hunting license is required to trap mice.Barbara and David Mikkelson, \\"Trapping License\\", at Snopes.com website. Accessed March 17, 2011. # Native Americans based on Native American treaties; some states require residency on a Native American reservation.See Hunting Licenses: Free Licenses and NEW YORK STATE DEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION: RESIDENT SPORTING LICENSE APPLICATION. Both retrieved February 23, 2012. The Supreme Court of the United States held in Menominee Tribe v. United States that Congress must affirmatively take away Native Americans' hunting rights; otherwise, Native Americans are presumed to have such rights and do not required hunting licenses. # Specific statutes, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and eagle feather laws (see below). # Alaskan Natives. # Active service members of the military, who often get free licenses. # The blind. # Sport hunting for targets. # Youth are usually exempt from paying for a hunting or fishing license, but this varies by state from those under 12 years old to those under 16 years of age.  Eagle Feather Law  The Eagle feather law, (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations), stipulates that only individuals of certifiable American Indian ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. American Indians and non-American Indians frequently contest the value and validity of the Eagle feather law, charging that the law is laden with discriminatory racial preferences and infringes on tribal sovereignty. Their arguments include that the law does not allow American Indians to give eagle feathers to non-American Indians, a common modern and traditional practice. (Many non-American Indians have been adopted into American Indian families, made tribal members, and given eagle feathers.) Challenges regarding the Second Amendment Some hunters have challenged hunting licenses, as being in violation of the right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by Second Amendment to the United States Constitution; the Supreme Court of the US in February 2008, heard arguments on the proper standard of review for gun laws or regulations.Joan Biskupic, Do you have a legal right to own a gun?, USA Today, February 27, 2008, p. 1-2. However, in District of Columbia v. Heller,District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ (2008). the Court declined to examine the broader issues, leaving state hunting licenses valid and in force. The current law is unclear as to what standard of review would apply, but the rational basis or arbitrary and capricious tests are the most likely standards. Under either standard, most hunting license regimes in the United States would likely pass muster, due to the need to conserve natural resources, to enforce the police power, and to raise revenue, all valid purposes of such laws. Public policy arguments Most major conservation organizations in the US favor the continued legality and regulation of hunting, including Ducks Unlimited, the National Wildlife Federation, and The Wilderness Society. The Defenders of Wildlife, National Audubon Society, and the World Wildlife FundThe WWF website states: \\"World Wildlife Fund, for example, does not oppose gun hunting or trapping by indigenous people to meet their basic needs. We do insist that hunting and trapping be regulated so that the survival of any species does not become threatened. The decision to allow trophy hunting is a sovereign one made entirely by the government concerned. We vigorously oppose any hunting or trapping activities which violate international, national, or state law.\\" also support licenses for regulated hunting of wildlife. The Sierra Club supports hunting licenses, but there has been tension in the group for two decades between those who want to ally with hunters and to regulate them, and those opposed to hunting altogether. The American Humane Association and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are opposed to hunting, and would ban the practice rather than regulating it.

The Gherardeschi or della Gherardesca were a family of the Republic of Pisa, dating back as early as the 11th century of Longobard origin. They were an important one of the most prominent initially in Pisa, then of Volterra and eventually and of Florence. They were of Ghibelline sympathies and held the county of Donoratico. Story Constantine I of Gallura may have been a member of the family, ruling Gallura on behalf of the Archdiocese of Pisa. The Gherardeschi had a rivalry with the House of Visconti, another Ghibelline family of Pisa. In 1237, the Archbishop and the Emperor Frederick II intervened in Pisa to reconcile the two rivals, but failed. In 1254, the citizenry rebelled and imposed twelve Anziani del Popolo (\\"Elders of the People\\") as their political representatives. Early on in the century, the Gherardeschi took an interest in the affairs of Pisa in Sardinia. In 1230, Ubaldo of Gallura, a Visconti, invaded the Giudicato of Cagliari, but the Gherardeschi repulsed him in the name of Benedetta and the young William II. In 1258, they received a third of Cagliari after its dismemberment. Their third was the south-western third; in the 1272 circa the count Ugolino della Gherardesca founded in the Cixerri the important mining town of Villa di Chiesa, today Iglesias. A Gherardesca woman also married John Visconti, the Judge of Gallura, who had received the northeastern third of Cagliari. This marriage brought final reconciliation between the Visconti and Gherardeschi. The Gherardeschi reached their height in Pisa in the person of Ugolino della Gherardesca in the 1270s and 1280s. He was forced to share power with his nephew Nino Visconti, but they soon quarrelled. The fed-up Pisans arrested Ugolino and deposed Nino from Gallura.

Such devices became known as appliances because of the similarity in role or management to a home appliance, which are generally closed and sealed, and are not serviceable by the user or owner. The hardware and software are delivered as an integrated product and may even be pre-configured before delivery to a customer, to provide a turn-key solution for a particular application. Unlike general purpose computers, appliances are generally not designed to allow the customers to change the software and the underlying operating system, or to flexibly reconfigure the hardware. Another form of appliance is the virtual appliance, which has similar functionality to a dedicated hardware appliance, but is distributed as a software virtual machine image for a hypervisor- equipped device. Overview Traditionally, software applications run on top of a general-purpose operating system, which uses the hardware resources of the computer (primarily memory, disk storage, processing power, and networking bandwidth) to meet the computing needs of the user. The main issue with the traditional model is related to complexity. It is complex to integrate the operating system and applications with a hardware platform, and complex to support it afterwards. By tightly constraining the variations of the hardware and software, the appliance becomes easily deployable, and can be used without nearly as wide (or deep) IT knowledge. Additionally, when problems and errors appear, the supporting staff very rarely needs to explore them deeply to understand the matter thoroughly. The staff needs merely training on the appliance management software to be able to resolve most of problems. In all forms of the computer appliance model, customers benefit from easy operations. The appliance has exactly one combination of hardware and operating system and application software, which has been pre-installed at the factory. This prevents customers from needing to perform complex integration work, and dramatically simplifies troubleshooting. In fact, this \\"turnkey operation\\" characteristic is the driving benefit that customers seek when purchasing appliances. To be considered an appliance, the (hardware) device needs to be integrated with software, and both are supplied as a package. This distinguishes appliances from \\"home grown\\" solutions, or solutions requiring complex implementations by integrators or Value-added resellers (VARs). The appliance approach helps to decouple the various systems and applications, for example in the data center. Once a resource is decoupled, in theory it can be also centralized to become shared among many systems, centrally managed and optimized, all without requiring changes to any other system. Tradeoffs of the computer appliance approach The major disadvantage of deploying a computer appliance is that since they are designed to supply a specific resource, they most often include a customized operating system running over specialized hardware, neither of which are likely to be compatible with the other systems previously deployed. Customers lose flexibility. One may believe that a proprietary embedded operating system, or operating system within an application, can make the appliance much more secure from common cyber attacks. However, the opposite is true. Security by obscurity is a poor security decision, and appliances are often plagued by security issues as evidenced by the proliferation of IoT devices.https://www.businessinsider.com/iot-security-privacy?r=DE&IR;=T Types of appliances A Niksun network security appliance, being used by the U.S. Army (2016) The variety of computer appliances reflects the wide range of computing resources they provide to applications.

Proprietary, embedded, firmware applications running on the appliance use point-to-point connections to translate data between field devices in their native automation protocols and MES systems through their APIs, ODBC, or RESTful interfaces. ;Anti-spam appliances: for e-mail spam ;Software appliances: a software application that might be combined with just enough operating system (JeOS) for it to run on industry standard hardware or in a virtual machine. In essence, the software distribution or the firmware that is running a computer appliance. ;Virtual machine appliances: consist of a \\"hypervisor style\\" embedded operating system running on appliance hardware. The hypervisor layer is matched to the hardware of the appliance, and cannot be varied by the customer, but the customer may load other operating systems and applications onto the appliance in the form of virtual machines.

These include: *Digital video recorder *Residential gateway *Network-attached storage (NAS) *Video game console Consumer uses stress the need for an appliance to have easy installation, configuration, and operation, with little or no technical knowledge being necessary. Appliances in industrial automation Back of a Siemens programmable logic controller (2013) The world of industrial automation has been rich in appliances. These appliances have been hardened to withstand temperature and vibration extremes. These appliances are also highly configurable, enabling customization to meet a wide variety of applications. The key benefits of an appliance in automation are: # Reduced downtime - a failed appliance is typically replaced with a COTS \\"commercial off-the-shelf\\" replacement and its task is quickly and easily reloaded from a backup. # Highly scalable - appliances are typically targeted solutions for an area of a plant or process. As the requirements change, scalability is achieved through the installation of another appliance. Automation concepts are easily replicated throughout the enterprise by standardizing on appliances to perform the needed tasks, as opposed to the development of custom automation schemes for each task. # Low TCO (total cost of ownership) - appliances are developed, tested and supported by automation product vendors and undergo a much broader level of quality testing than custom designed automation solutions. The use of appliances in automation reduce the level of testing needed in each individual application. # Reduced design time - appliances perform specific functions and although they are highly configurable, they are typically self documenting. This enables appliance based solutions to be transferred from engineer to engineer with minimal need for training and documentation. Types of automation appliances: # PLC (programmable logic controller) - Programmable logic controllers are appliances that are typically used for discrete control and offer a wide range of Input and Output options. They are configured through standardized programming languages such as IEC-1131. # SLC (single loop controller) - Single loop controllers are appliances that monitor an input variable and effect change on a control output (manipulated variable) to hold the input variable to a setpoint. # PAC (programmable automation controller) - Programmable automation controllers are appliances that embody properties of both PLCs and SLCs enabling the integration of both analog and discrete control. # Universal gateway - A universal gateway appliance has the ability to communicate with a variety of devices through their respective communication protocols, and will affect data transactions between them. This in increasingly important as manufacturing strives to improve agility, quality, production rates, production costs and reduce downtime through enhanced M2M (machine to machine) communications. # EATMs (Enterprise Appliance Transaction Modules) - Enterprise appliance transaction modules are appliances that affect data transactions from plant floor automation systems to enterprise business systems. They communicate to plant floor equipment through various vendor automation protocols, and communicate to business systems through database communication protocols such as JMS (Java Message Service) and SQL (Structured Query Language). Internal structure There are several design patterns adopted by computer appliance vendors, a few of which are shown below. Since the whole concept of an appliance rests on keeping such implementation details away from the end user, it is difficult to match these patterns to specific appliances, particularly since they can and do change without affecting external capabilities or performance. # Special chip - the vendor builds an ASIC, without any separate \\"software\\" or operating system. The appliance has a limited interface, usually terminal console or web-based, to allow some basic configuration by the IT staff. The manufacturer often provides some way of accessing deeper configuration mechanisms. Azul Systems' Vega 3 Java Compute Appliance is an example; special hardware modifications to the chip enable Java application scaling. # Special software kernel - the vendor uses or creates a general-purpose computer, and designs a new operating system that integrates the application into the operating system. Cisco's IOS is an example; the Unix-like operating system has firewall functions and network/firewall configuration commands built into it. Sometimes, the device is also sealed, so the consumer has no access to reinstall the operating system or replace it with another operating system. The consumer may also be restricted to a small group of configuration commands, while the more detailed and lower level functions of the operating system are only available to the vendor. The more this \\"locked down\\" approach is carried out, the closer this type of device comes to appearing like an ASIC device. # Specialized application - off-the-shelf computers and operating systems are used, but the user interface and \\"box\\" are designed so the user cannot access anything on the computer, except for the application interface that the vendor has created. Since the underlying computing architecture is locked down and essentially invisible, it becomes difficult to discern that the device really functions on top of general purpose hardware and operating systems. Linux, and BSD to a lesser degree, has become the operating system of choice for this type of appliance. Recently the term software appliance has also been used to describe such a pre-packaged, black-box combination. # Virtual appliance - here the hardware itself has disappeared entirely and become a so-called virtual appliance (also known as a virtual software appliance) using any one of a number of virtual machine technologies. Within this virtual machine is essentially the same stack of software plus the operating system as in the \\"specialized application\\" alternative. Sometimes, these techniques are mixed. For example, a VPN appliance might contain a limited access software firewall running on Linux, with an encryption ASIC to speed up VPN access. Some computer appliances use solid state storage, while others use a hard drive to load an operating system. Again, the two methods might be mixed‚Äîan ASIC print server might allow an optional hard drive for job queueing, or a Linux-based device may encode Linux in firmware, so that a hard drive is not needed to load the operating system.

Biography Ishmael was the youngest of nine children born to Samuel and Leola Hancock Flory in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In 1918, the Flory family moved to Los Angeles, where Ishmael graduated from Jefferson High School. Flory entered the University of California, Los Angeles in 1927. After taking a few years off to work, he received his degree from University of California, Berkeley in 1933. Civil rights activism After graduation from UC Berkeley, Flory accepted a fellowship from the Fisk University masters program in sociology. While a graduate student at Fisk, he was involved in protesting the lynching of Cordie Cheek, a Nashville teenager. He was asked to leave the university after organizing a protest against Jim Crow policies. This episode was recounted in an essay written by Langston Hughes in 1934: > I see in our papers where Fisk University, that great center of Negro > Education and of Jubilee fame, has expelled Ishmael Flory, a graduate > student from California on a special honor scholarship, because he dared > organize a protest against the University singers appearing in a Nashville > Jim Crow theater where colored people must go up a back alley to sit in the > gallery. Probably also the University resented his organizing, through the > Denmark Vesey Forum, a silent protest parade denouncing the lynching of > Cordie Cheek, who was abducted almost at the very gates of the University. > ‚ÄîLangston Hughes, Cowards from the Colleges In 1939 Flory moved to Chicago, where he became head of Joint Council of Dining Car Employees, organizer for the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers and president of Chicago chapter of the National Negro Congress. In the 1940s and 1950s, he worked with many civil rights activists, including Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois and William L. Patterson. He was one of many activists to help integrate major league baseball. In the 1960s, Flory co-founded the African American Heritage Association. Flory was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Political life Flory had been a member of the Communist Party since the 1930s, and was the head of the CPUSA in Illinois. He ran for Governor of Illinois on the CPUSA ticket in 1972 and 1976, and ran for U.S. Senate in 1974 and 1984.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=33090 Candidate details at OurCampaigns Commonly taking anti-US stances, he and Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA lambasted then current President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger that they were \\"threatening World War in their attempts to salvage the sinking ship of the world and U.S. capitalism.\\" Sources *\\"Ishmael Flory, fighter for equality, 96\\".

The collection spans from the Middle Ages to contemporary art, with an emphasis on Swiss art. Architecture The museum was drawn-up by architects Karl Moser and Robert Curjel and opened in 1910. Particularly notable are the several preserved Moser interiors in the original section of the museum, decorated in masterful Neo-Grec version of Secession style. The bas-reliefs on the facade are by Moser's longtime collaborator Oskar Kiefer. The original museum building was extended in 1925, 1958 and 1976.Martin Bailey (June 20, 2014), A tale of two extensions The Art Newspaper. The architectural competition for a $230 million extension was won by London-based David Chipperfield. His design is a massive rectangular sandstone-covered building. The extension will add 5,040 square meters of galleries, increasing display space by 78%. The Kunsthaus will become the largest Swiss art museum, overtaking Basel in the available space but not the collection.

By the time the powerplant for which it was designed was sufficiently plentiful it was obsolete as an operational aircraft, and apart from a few examples sent to the Middle East it served as a trainer and Home Defence fighter. Design and development Geoffrey de Havilland was one of the pioneering designers at the Royal Aircraft Factory and was partially or wholly responsible for most prewar \\"Factory\\" designs. When he left to become chief designer at The Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Airco) in 1914, his first design was strongly reminiscent of the F.E.2, one of the last designs on which he had worked at the Royal Aircraft Factory. Like the F.E.2, the DH.1 was of pusher configuration, accommodating its pilot and observer in two open tandem cockpits in the nose. The observer's cockpit was stepped down below the pilot's and equipped with a machine gun. The wings were of typical fabric- covered, two-bay, unstaggered, unswept, equal span design, while the stabiliser and rudder were carried on the end of two long, open-framework booms.Mason 1992, p. 39. The type, like the F.E.2b, was designed for the water-cooled Beardmore 120 hp (89 kW) inline engine.Jackson 1987, p. 44. However, all available Beardmore engines were required for F.E.2b and R.E.5 production, so the air-cooled Renault 70 hp (52 kW) V8 engine was installed instead. The prototype was fitted with aerofoils attached to the side of the nacelle which could be rotated through 90 degrees to act as air brakes, an unusual feature for the time, although they were soon removed. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with the mainwheels carried on V-struts, using coil springs and oleos for the suspension. In January 1915 Geoffrey de Havilland piloted the D.H.1 prototype on its first flight at Hendon. Although the Renault engine left it underpowered, performance was still reasonableMason 1992, p. 40. and the type was ordered into production, with an initial order of 49 being placed. Airco was already occupied with building and designing other aircraft, so DH.1 production was undertaken by Savages Limited of King's Lynn, which had previously manufactured fairground equipment.Rickard, J. \\"Airco D.H.1.\\" History of War, 31 March 2009. Retrieved: 17 October 2011. These aircraft used a simpler rubber cord suspension, and had a revised cockpit coaming to give a better field of fire for the observer's gun. Production was initially very slow, and only five examples of the type had reached the RFC by the end of 1915. Later production machines were fitted with the Beardmore engine, as originally intended, as these had become more plentiful. This version was redesignated the DH.1A. Although testing of the DH.1A showed it to be at least as good as the F.E.2b, this was hardly a recommendation, as the F.E. was itself already slated for replacement with more modern tractor types. Nonetheless, a further order for 50 DH.1As was placed with Savages. By the time of the DH.1's first flight, a single-seat \\"follow-up\\" was already being considered; and by June 1915 the first D.H.2 had already made its maiden flight.Jackson, 1978 p47 Designed essentially as a smaller version of the D.H.1, the D.H. 2 was to become of one of the most important British fighters of the period. Operational history The DH.1 saw operational service only in the Middle East theatre, where six Beardmore- powered DH.1As arrived in July 1916. These were used by No. 14 Squadron RFC as escorts for their B.E.2 reconnaissance aircraft. An Aviatik two-seater was claimed by a 14 Squadron D.H.1A on 2 August 1916 for the only known victory of the type. The last known action by a DH.1 was on 5 March 1917, when one was shot down during a bombing raid on Tel el Sheria.Bruce 1982, p. 40. No. 14 Squadron became an R.E.8 unit in November 1917; it seems probable that the last operational DH.1 had gone before that date. The other DH.1s served in training, with 43 aircraft allotted and Home Defence units in the United Kingdom receiving an additional 24 aircraft, finally being withdrawn from service in 1918.Jackson 1987, p. 45. Variants ;DH.1 :Prototype and early- production aircraft powered by 70hp Renault engine. ;DH.1A :Some 70 production examples powered by a 120hp Beardmore engine Total production was one prototype and 99 DH.1 and DH.1As, all production examples built by Savages.

Endowed with executive ability and magnetic personality, and being a man of deep piety, he ably bridged the gulf that separated the old and the modern views of Judaism. Recognizing his administrative ability, the government repeatedly entrusted Cantoni with the drafting of statutes affecting the Jewish communities. In 1848 he actively recruited among Turin's Jews and helped organize volunteers into three battalions of sharpshooters to fight for Piedmont-Sardinia against Austria-Hungary.Jews in the Army of the Kingdom of Italy After the emancipation of the Sardinian Jews in 1848, Cantoni was mainly occupied with the organization of the internal administration of Jewish religious matters. To effect this he published his Nuovo Ordinamento del Culto Israelitico nes Regi Stati, in which he advocated the establishment by the government of consistories, pointing out the means by which these could be supported. Cantoni was the chief promoter of the establishment of asylums for children. He was also instrumental in founding the best schools and societies of the community of Turin. Most noteworthy among his achievements was his work on behalf of the emancipation of the Jews in the kingdom of Sardinia through the Constitution of 1848, which was subsequently transferred to united Italy. Cantoni's untimely death prevented the realization of his hopes of founding an organization to include all the communities and rabbis of Italy.

He was previously the head coach of Marian University, the University of Iowa, and Butler University men's basketball teams. He spent the 2011-12 season as an assistant coach at Miami (Ohio). Early years Lickliter was a starting point guard at North Central High School in Indianapolis, where he played for his father, Arlan. He helped North Central to a sectional title in Hinkle Fieldhouse in 1973, and he played his final high school game in the Fieldhouse in the 1974 sectional semifinals. Following his high school graduation, he enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW) but wound up transferring to Central Florida Community College. He played one season at Central Florida, earning an associate degree in 1977, and then transferred to Butler, where he played his final two collegiate seasons, 1977-79. He earned a B.S. degree in secondary education from Butler in 1979.  Early coaching career  Lickliter began his collegiate coaching career at Butler University in 1988-89 under his former college coach, Joe Sexson. He left the Bulldogs after a year to accept a head coaching job at Danville High School in Danville, Indiana, where he remained for three seasons. He returned to the collegiate ranks in 1996 as an administrative assistant on Barry Collier's staff. Lickliter accepted an assistant coaching position at Eastern Michigan in 1997 and remained on the Eagles' staff for two seasons, before returning to Butler in 1999. In six NCAA Division I seasons, he contributed to teams that won three conference regular season championships, four conference tournament titles, made four NCAA Tournament appearances, and compiled a 106-73 record. Lickliter played a prominent role in refining Butler's basketball system during his stint as assistant coach to Collier and Thad Matta. During his three seasons on the staff of the two former head coaches, the Bulldogs had three 20-win seasons, won three conference regular season titles, three league tournament crowns and three trips to the NCAA Tournament.

Early life Walsh was born April 2, 1850 to Michael Walsh, a farmer, and Bridget Scully. He was most likely born on his father's farm, Baptistgrange, in Lisronagh, Tipperary, Ireland. Walsh had the following siblings: *Maria Walsh, who later married Arthur Lafferty, a two-gun police sergeant in Leadville, Colorado *Michael Walsh, who died in 1904 in Denver, Colorado of dropsy of the liver According to his daughter's book, Father Struck It Rich, he became an apprentice to a millwright at the age of twelve and grew into a fine carpenter.Father Struck It Rich, by Evalyn Walsh Mclean, Little, Brown And Company, 1936, page 14. Retrieved August 24, 2019. In 1869, he emigrated to the United States with his sister, Maria, after the death of his father. For a time, he settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, with his aunts, Catherine and Bridget Walsh Power, who helped \\"shake the greenhorn off him\\". Career In the early 1870s, he heeded the call to \\"go west, young man\\" and found himself in Colorado getting paid well for his carpentry skills. During the 1870s, the Black Hills of South Dakota saw a gold rush that attracted hordes of hopeful men afflicted with gold fever. It has been said that at first Walsh was attracted to the opportunities that came with the gold rush, including trading goods and services at inflated prices, as opposed to the gold rush itself. Gradually, he became more and more immersed in the world of gold and was soon trading mining equipment to prospectors for mining claims as payment. He also studied mining technology at night. In 1877, he moved to Leadville, Colorado with a small fortune between $75,000 () and $100,000 (). Along with his wife, he ran the Grand Central Hotel in Leadville. After becoming an expert in the subject in gold mining, Walsh was overcome by gold fever and took to the hills. Unlike other prospectors he took a far more methodical and careful approach to prospecting which soon paid off. In 1896, he came home and uttered the words which later became the title of his daughter's book, \\"Daughter, I've struck it rich!\\" The Camp Bird Gold Mine near Ouray, Colorado soon turned out $5,000/day () in ore and produced riches for the Walsh family \\"beyond the dreams of avarice\\". In a short period of time, Walsh extracted a fortune totaling $3,000,000 (). Washington, DC Walsh home in Washington, DC The wealth that Walsh discovered soon provided the family with a lavish lifestyle that included trips to Europe, fine clothes, and expensive motor cars. Around 1898, the family moved to Washington, D.C. where in 1900, he was appointed by President William McKinley as a commissioner to the Paris Exposition of 1899. Personal life Carrie Reed WalshOn July 11, 1879 in Leadville, Colorado, he married Carrie Bell Reed. The couple had two children: *Evalyn Walsh, August 1, 1886 ‚Äì April 24, 1947 *Vinson Walsh, April 9, 1888 ‚Äì August 19, 1905, who died in a car accident In 1903 the family moved into the ornate mansion at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue. Later, the house became the Indonesian Embassy.Weeks, Christopher (1994). AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C. (3d ed.), pp. 179-80. Johns Hopkins University Press. . On January 23, 1909, The Aero Club of Washington was founded, with Walsh as serving president, to promote the new technology of Aviation. Due to his involvement with the Paris Exposition of 1899, Walsh became friends with King Leopold of Belgium, whom he created a suite in his home to host. Unfortunately, the King never made a trip to the United States. However, when King Albert, Leopold's nephew, and Queen Elisabeth traveled to the United States in 1919, Walsh's wife, then widowed, was decorated by the King for her service during World War I. In 1908, Walsh's daughter Evalyn, and only living child at the time, married Edward Beale McLean, the son of John Roll McLean, who became the publisher and owner of The Washington Post newspaper in 1916 until 1933.New York Times - July 23, 1908Chicago Daily Tribune, November 15, 1931 Thomas Francis Walsh died on April 8, 1910, at his home in Washington, D.C.

Mining for iron ore was taking place in the 1820s when Edward Protheroe opened up ore mines near Milkwall. In the mid-1860s, Easter, a deep mine at Milkwall, employed around 50 men and boys.Forest of Dean: Industry, Victoria County History An early tramroad to serve the mines, was built by the Severn & Wye tramroad company to connect to their junction at Parkend. In 1875, the Severn & Wye constructed a railway to Coleford. It left the main line at Parkend and in places shadowed the Milkwall branch tramroad. A station was provided at Milkwall for this branch line. The production of lime, which during the 19th century was used as flux in local ironworks as well as for farming and building, also took place in Milkwall. There were engineering works at Milkwall belonging in 1889 to Tom Morgan which continued casting metals after World War I. A colour (pigment) factory was started at Milkwall in 1926 - it employed 7 people in 1965, when in addition to processing oxides mined elsewhere it ground coal for use in the paper and fibreboard industries and in drills. A beerhouse (later to become the Tufthorn inn which was taken over in 2006 by Jack Crook possibly the youngest landlord Gloucestershire at the time) opened at Milkwall by the late 1870s.Forest of Dean: Social life, Victoria County History A wooden village hall was built after World War I and a recreation ground was laid out in the mid-1930s.

Blake was born in Embsay, Skipton, Yorkshire, and was a right-handed batsman and right arm, roundarm, medium pace bowler. He made his debut for Lancashire in the Roses Match at Fartown, Huddersfield in 1877. Batting at number 9 in Lancashire's first innings he made a creditable 26, before being bowled by Armitage in a match won by Lancashire by nine wickets. This proved to be his only game for the red rose county, and he re-appeared in 1880 for Yorkshire against Derbyshire on the same ground. He scored 16 in a match won by Yorkshire by an innings. His final first-class game was against Gloucestershire at the Clifton College Close Ground in August 1880. He was bowled by W. G. Grace for seven in the first innings, and bowled by his brother G. F. Grace in the second for 21, as Gloucestershire ran out winners by six wickets. Blake then vanished from the first-class scene, and indeed the history books as the date and circumstances of his death are not known. Overall, he scored 70 runs at an average of 17.5.

As of 2008 it is 47 km long and 30 km wide.Zahran, p.283 Geography Lake Manzala is long but quite shallow. Though Lake Manzala's unaltered depth is only four to five feet, alterations to the depth were made during the construction of the Suez Canal to allow the Canal to extend 29 miles lengthwise along the lake. Its bed is soft clay. Before construction of the Suez Canal, Lake Manzala was separated from the Mediterranean Sea by a strip of sand 200 to 300 yards wide. Port Said was established adjacent to Lake Manzala during the nineteenth century to support canal construction and related travel. The lake's location directly south of the Port Said Airport restricts the city's capacity for growth. Suez Canal Lake Manzala is the northernmost of three natural lakes intersected by the Suez Canal, the other two being Lake Timsah and the Great Bitter Lake. Construction of the canal proceeded from north to south, reaching Manzala first. Due to the lake's shallowness, it was necessary to dig a banked channel for ships to pass. Ecology Fishermen at Lake Manzala Lake Manzala served as a significant source of inexpensive fish for human consumption in Egypt, but pollution and lake drainage have reduced the lake's productivity. In 1985, the lakes fishery was an open area of 89,000 ha and employed roughly 17,000 workers. The government of Egypt drained substantial portions of the lake in an effort to convert its rich Nile deposits to farmland. The project was unprofitable: crops did not grow well in the salty soil and the value of resulting produce was less than the market value of the fish that the reclaimed land had formerly yielded. By 2001, Lake Manzala had lost approximately 80 percent of its former area through the effects of drainage efforts.Ibrahim, p.145 NotesReferences  Manzala Category:Nile Delta Category:Port Said ","title":"Lake Manzala"},{"id":"10430279","text":"TEV protease (, Tobacco Etch Virus nuclear-inclusion-a endopeptidase) is a highly sequence-specific cysteine protease from Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV). It is a member of the PA clan of chymotrypsin-like proteases. Due to its high sequence specificity it is frequently used for the controlled cleavage of fusion proteins in vitro and in vivo.  Origin  The tobacco etch virus encodes its entire genome as a single massive polyprotein (350 kDa). This is cleaved into functional units by the three proteases: P1 protease (1 cleavage site), helper-component protease (1 cleavage site) and TEV protease (7 cleavage sites).UniProt: TEV polyprotein: The native TEV protease also contains an internal self-cleavage site. This site is slowly cleaved to inactivate the enzyme (the physiological reason for this is unknown).  Structure and function  Structure of TEV protease. The double Œ≤-barrels that define the superfamily are highlighted in red. () The structure of TEV protease has been solved by X-ray crystallography. It is composed of two Œ≤-barrels and a flexible C-terminal tail and displays structural homology to the chymotrypsin superfamily of proteases (PA clan, C4 family by MEROPS classification). Although homologous to cellular serine proteases (such as trypsin, elastase, thrombin etc.), TEV protease uses a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile (as do many other viral proteases). Covalent catalysis is performed with an Asp-His-Cys triad, split between the two barrels (Asp on Œ≤1 and His and Cys on Œ≤2). The substrate is held as a Œ≤-sheet, forming an antiparallel interaction with the cleft between the barrels and a parallel interaction with the C-terminal tail. The enzyme therefore forms a binding tunnel around the substrate and side chain interactions control specificity.  Specificity  substrate (black), also showing the catalytic triad (red). The substrate binds inside an active site tunnel (left). A cutaway (right) shows the complementary shape of the binding tunnel to the substrate. () The preferred, native cleavage sequence was first identified by examining the cut sites in the native polyprotein substrate for recurring sequence. The consensus for these native cut sites is ENLYFQ\\\\S where ‚Äò\\\\‚Äô denotes the cleaved peptide bond. Residues of the substrate are labelled P6 to P1 before the cut site and P1‚Äô after the cut site. Early works also measured cleavage of an array of similar substrates to characterise how specific the protease was for the native sequence. Studies have subsequently used sequencing of cleaved substrates from a pool of randomised sequences to determine preference patterns. Although ENLYFQ\\\\S is the optimal sequence, the protease is active to a greater or lesser extent on a range of substrates (i.e. shows some substrate promiscuity). The highest cleavage is of sequences closest to the consensus EXLYŒ¶Q\\\\œÜ where X is any residue, Œ¶ is any large or medium hydrophobe and œÜ is any small hydrophobic or polar residue. Although this sequence is the optimal, sequences with disfavoured residues at some positions can still be cleaved if the rest of the sequence is optimal. Specificity is endowed by the large contact area between enzyme and substrate. Proteases such as trypsin have specificity for one residue before and after the cleaved bond due to a shallow binding cleft with only one or two pockets that bind the substrate side chains. Conversely, viral proteases such as TEV protease have a long C-terminal tail which completely covers the substrate to create a binding tunnel. This tunnel contains a set of tight binding pockets such that each side chain of the substrate peptide (P6 to P1‚Äô) is bound in a complementary site (S6 to S1‚Äô). In particular, peptide side chain P6-Glu contacts a network of three hydrogen bonds; P5-Asn points into the solvent, making no specific interactions (hence the absence of substrate consensus at this position); P4-Leu is buried in a hydrophobic pocket; P3-Tyr is held in a hydrophobic pocket with a short hydrogen bond at the end; P2-Phe is also surrounded by hydrophobes including the face of the triad histidine; P1-Gln forms four hydrogen bonds; and P1‚Äô-Ser is only partly enclosed in a shallow hydrophobic groove.  As a biochemical tool One of the main uses of this protein is for removing affinity tags from purified recombinant fusion proteins. The reason for the use of TEV protease as a biochemical tool is its high sequence specificity. This specificity allows for the controlled cleavage of proteins when the preference sequence is inserted into flexible loops. It also makes it relatively non-toxic in vivo as the recognized sequence scarcely occurs in proteins. Although rational design has had limited success in changing protease specificity, directed evolution has been used to change the preferred residue either before or after the cleavage site. However, TEV protease does have limitations as a biochemical tool. It is prone to deactivation by self- cleavage (autolysis), though this can be abolished through a single S219V mutation in the internal cleavage site. The protease expressed alone is also poorly soluble, however several attempts have been made to improve its solubility through directed evolution and computational design. It has also been shown that expression can be improved by fusion to maltose binding protein (MBP) which acts a solubility enhancing partner. The molecular weight of this enzyme varies between 25 and 27 kDa depending on the specific construct used.

Family The son of Edward John Clark, and Margaret Clark, n√©e Cooper, Norman Childers Clark was born on 12 November 1878.Births: Clark, The South Australian Register, (Saturday, 30 November 1878), p.7. He married Eileen Florence Fleming (1888-1983) on 11 June 1918. They had two children: Norman Adrian Clark (1919-1998),World War Two Nominal Roll: Norman Adrian Clark (V43505). and Bryan Childers Clark (1923-2003).World War Two Nominal Roll: Bryan Childers Clark (V43505). Football Prior to joining Carlton, he had played in two premiership teams at North Adelaide. A talented sprinter, in 1899 he won the 130-yard Stawell Gift in eleven and four-fifths seconds, off a handicap of 14 and a half yards.Athletics, The (Launceston) Examiner, (Saturday, 15 April 1899), p.6. His prize of 50 gold sovereigns was used to buy a handmade gold pocket watch, in which he had his initials 'N.C.C' inscribed. He moved to Stawell, hoping to win another Gift, and he played two seasons with Stawell Football Club. Upon his arrival at Carlton in 1905, his team-mates noticed his exceptional physique and nicknamed him \\"Hackenschmidt\\" after the famous strongman and professional wrestler, Georg Hackenschmidt.\\"Norman Clarke, coach and captain of Brighton, and a little time ago a doughty Carlton back, is looked up to by the football world as \\"Hackenschmidt\\", as he is as strong as the village blacksmith of Longfellow's time.\\": Nicknames, The (Melbourne) Herald, (Saturday, 5 July 1913), p.1. He played in three consecutive premiership sides for Carlton from 1906‚Äì1908 as well as coaching Carlton to back-to-back premierships in 1914‚Äì15. He was the only person involved in Carlton's first five VFL flags. After leaving Carlton at the end of the 1918 season he took up the head coaching role at Richmond. In his first season, he took the Tigers to the Grand Final. This attained him the rare feat of coaching two separate clubs in VFL Grand Finals. Clark was also the coach of VFL sides St Kilda in 1925‚Äì26 and North Melbourne in 1931. He was captain- coach of Victorian Football Association (VFA) side Brighton in 1913.Brighton Club, The Argus, (Saturday, 22 February 1913), p.17. He coached junior and senior football for seventeen seasons in the VFA, the VFL and the Ringwood Districts Football Association, with four more premierships to his credit by the time he retired after the 1931 season. Clark died on Boxing Day in 1943.Deaths: Clark, The Age, (Monday, 27 December 1943), p.3; Obituary: Mr Norman Clark, The Argus, (Monday, 27 December 1943), p.8.

Originally bodyguards for Adolf Hitler, it later provided men for the protection of other high-ranking leaders of the Nazi regime. The group, although similar in name, was completely separate from the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) which was the formal intelligence service for the SS, the Nazi Party and later Nazi Germany. Its role included personal security, investigation of assassination plots, surveillance of locations before the arrival of Nazi dignitaries and vetting buildings as well as guests. The RSD had the power to request assistance from any other SS organisations and take command of all Ordnungspolizei (order police) in its role protecting the Nazi functionaries. Formation The RSD was founded on 15 March 1933 as the F√ºhrerschutzkommando (\\"F√ºhrer protection command\\"; FSK) under the command of then SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Johann Rattenhuber. His deputy was Peter H√∂gl. Originally charged with protecting the F√ºhrer only while he was inside the borders of Bavaria, its members consisted of criminal-police detectives of the Bavarian police. Since the small group was made up of Bavarian police officers, they could only operate within the area of their authority. Hitler's protection outside Bavaria was already entrusted to an eight-member bodyguard known as the SS-Begleitkommando des F√ºhrers, which was founded on 29 February 1932. Hitler wanted a home-grown close protection group while in Munich because this was the traditional birthplace of the Nazi Party and where any plots would therefore have added significance. In the spring of 1934, the F√ºhrerschutzkommando replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's overall protection throughout Germany. In 1935 the FSK squad for Hitler's protection was made up of 17 men. An additional force of 76 FSK men protected other leading members of the party, including Hermann G√∂ring, Rudolf Hess, Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler; along with performing other security related duties. The FSK was officially renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst (Reich Security Service; RSD) on 1 August 1935. Himmler finally gained full control over the RSD in October 1935. Although Himmler was officially named chief, Rattenhuber remained in command and took his orders for the most part from Hitler or a chief aide such as Julius Schaub. Himmler was given administrative control over the RSD and the SS gained influence over its members. As for the SS-Begleitkommando, it was expanded and became known as the F√ºhrerbegleitkommando (F√ºhrer Escort Command; FBK). The FBK continued under separate command until April 1945 and remained responsible for Hitler's close personal protection. Pre-war role The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. For those occasions, Rattenhuber would be in overall command and the FBK chief would act as his deputy. Before a trip, the RSD had the responsibly of checking the route, the buildings along the route, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office would provide intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. For motorcades, following Hitler's Mercedes-Benz would be two cars to the left and right, one with FBK men and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Hitler's motorcade with FBK and RSD escort cars to the left and right behind his car, as they head towards the city center of Vienna in 1938 In 1936 a resolution of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht gave members of the RSD the status of being Wehrmacht officers, but with authority that included extra jurisdictional powers and privileges. It was formally called the Reichssicherheitsdienst Gruppe Geheime Feldpolizei z. b. V (Reich Security Service Group Secret Field Police for special duties/zur besondere Verwendung). They were considered military police officers that were technically on the staff of Reichsfuhrer-SS Himmler with its personnel wearing the uniform of the SS with the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) diamond on the lower left sleeve. Those who were eligible to claim SS membership could join the RSD and all officers had to present proof that they were of German blood. In 1937 all RSD officers were made members of the SS breaking the link to the regular army. By that year, the RSD had 100 men in its ranks. Wartime operations On the outbreak of World War II, the RSD had 200 men in its ranks. It protected Hitler, along with other government and inner circle members as they travelled around occupied Europe. By 1944, there were seventeen RSD units protecting the top leadership. As RSD commander Rattenhuber was responsible for securing Hitler's field headquarters. In particular, a battalion guarded the Wolf's Lair near the town of Rastenburg, now Kƒôtrzyn in Poland. Rattenhuber's deputy, Peter H√∂gl was appointed Chief of RSD Department 1 (responsible for the personal protection of Hitler on a day-to-day basis during the war). The Wolf's Lair had three security zones. Sperrkreis 1 (Security Zone 1) was located at the heart of the Wolf's Lair. Ringed by steel fencing and guarded by RSD and FBK men, it contained Hitler's bunker and ten other camouflaged bunkers built from thick steel-reinforced concrete. Hitler first arrived at the Wolf's Lair on 23 June 1941 and departed for the last time on 20 November 1944. Overall, he spent over 800 days there during that three and half year period. By early 1945, Germany's military situation was on the verge of total collapse. In January 1945, Rattenhuber accompanied Hitler and his entourage into the bunker complex under the Reich Chancellery garden in the central government sector of Berlin. The FBK and the rest of Hitler's personal staff moved into the Vorbunker and F√ºhrerbunker. FBK and RSD men were stationed outside the F√ºhrerbunker entrances. Main entry into the F√ºhrerbunker was from a stairway built at right angles leading down from the Vorbunker. After descending the stairs into the lower section, RSD and FBK men were positioned in a guard room to check identity cards and search briefcases, before personnel were allowed to pass into the corridor of the F√ºhrerbunker proper. To the Nazi leadership it was clear that the battle for Berlin, which started in late April, would be the final battle of the war. On 27 April 1945, H√∂gl was sent out to find Himmler's liaison man, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Hermann Fegelein who had deserted his post at the F√ºhrerbunker. Fegelein was caught by H√∂gl's RSD squad in his Berlin apartment, wearing civilian clothes and preparing to flee to Sweden or Switzerland. He was carrying cash‚ÄîGerman and foreign‚Äîand jewellery, some of which belonged to Eva Braun. H√∂gl also uncovered a briefcase containing documents with evidence of Himmler's attempted peace negotiations with the western Allies. Fegelein was brought back to the F√ºhrerbunker and then shot on 28 April. After Hitler committed suicide on 30 April, Rattenhuber and the remaining RSD officers were taken prisoner by the Soviet Red Army on 1 May 1945 during the attempted break-out to avoid capture from central Berlin. After the war, Rattenhuber served 10 years in prison before being released by the Soviets on 10 October 1955.

Kellogg was born in Davenport, Iowa, and quickly dropped the name \\"Arthur\\". From a young age he devoted his free time to the study of wildlife. He built up his own small collection of mounted birds and mammals and by the time he came to choose a university he had determined he would become a naturalist. Choosing the University of Kansas as it offered courses in his chosen field, he first studied entomology, later switching to the study of mammals. From 1913 to 1916 he worked under Charles D. Bunker, the curator of birds and mammals at the university's Museum of Natural History. He published his first paper as a result of his work with Bunker. Kellogg graduated in 1915 and received his M.A. the following year. After graduating, he immediately began work with the United States Bureau of Biological Survey in Kansas and North Dakota. At the end of 1915 the Survey paid for him to travel to Washington, D.C. from where he undertook a tour of the museums of the eastern states. Around this time he decided to specialize in the study of marine mammals and in 1916 enrolled the University of California at Berkeley where he studied for a Ph.D in zoology. He was given a teaching fellowship at the behest of John C. Merriam, and studied fossil pinnipeds, producing his first important papers on the subject in 1920 and 1921. He served in the Army in France during World War I, but still found time to collect specimens which he sent back to Berkeley and the University of Kansas. He was discharged in July 1919 and returned to Berkeley to complete his doctorate, transferring from zoology to study vertebrate paleontology under Merriam. In 1921 he became assistant biologist for the Biological Survey based in Washington, and worked there for the next eight years, concerned chiefly with studying toads and the feeding habits of hawks and owls. He also undertook a study to determine whether alligators were a predatory risk to help resolve controversy over their hunting. Merriam encouraged Kellogg to use his free time to study the fossilized marine mammals of Calvert Cliffs in Maryland. He added considerably to the collections created by previous expeditions and used the experience he gained as the basis for his Ph.D thesis, entitled The History of Whales - Their Adaptation to Life in the Water in which he studied the specializations needed for mammalian organs to adjust to life in water. In 1928 Kellogg became assistant curator at the United States National Museum and in 1941 became curator. At the museum he devoted time to studying the Archaeoceti, primitive whales from the Eocene and early Oligocene, and the Miocene Cetacea of North America. In 1948 he was appointed director of the Museum and in 1958 was made assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1951. His Ph.D thesis had established him as an authority on cetaceans, and with concern growing over the need to protect whales from over- exploitation, in 1930 he was invited to speak at a conference on whaling held by the League of Nations. Further conferences followed and Kellogg was appointed as a US delegate to the International Conference on Whaling held in London in 1937, which resulted in the first protection for whales, the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling. Kellogg was head of the US delegation in two further conferences in 1944 and 1945 and was chairman of the 1946 conference, after which he became the US commissioner on International Whaling Commission between 1949 and 1967. He served as vice- chairman of the Commission between 1949 and 1951 and chairman between 1952 and 1954. He retired from his posts at the Smithsonian in 1962, but continued to work on his study of Miocene Cetacea, publishing nine papers on fossil marine mammals between 1965 and 1969. Ill-health, coupled with frustration over the lack of progress, forced him to abandon his work with the International Whaling Commission after 1964. He died of a heart attack at his home in Washington on 8 May 1969 whilst recuperating from a broken pelvis.

Foundation On 17 June 1936 all police forces throughout Germany were united, following Adolf Hitler's appointment of Heinrich Himmler as Chief of German Police. Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the Kripo and Gestapo. Reinhard Heydrich was appointed chief of the SiPo and was already head of the party Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service; SD) and the Gestapo. In 1936, the Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei was founded by Himmler, in order to create a centralized command office under Nazi control of the German criminal investigation and secret state police organizations.

Municipality of the province of V√©lez. Called by the natives of the region as \\"The Golden Gate of Santander\\", being the second Santander municipality by the southern entrance of the department.  History  Founding Date: May 24, 1539 Founder's name: Heliodoro Barbosa Barbosa called \\"Puerta de oro de Santander\\", its privileged geographical location, its colorful valley on the banks of the Suarez River, has allowed it to become the nerve center of an extensive region and the roads that converge in it have made it an obligatory one of the most powerful municipalities in the department. His first embryo was the Center populated of Cite, today its corregimiento, founded by Mart√≠n Galeano the 24 of May 1539 (it is considered the first population founded in the department of Santander since V√©lez was founded on July 3, 1539) and for many years it held the category of municipality, he first came to the legal life on October 1, 1939 precisely as a corregimiento attached to Our Lady of Cite, but its unusual development, especially caused by its rapid growth of business led to the Assembly of the department to approve ordinance No. 42 of June 21, 1940, turning it into a municipal seat. Its name is a tribute to the Spanish general Heliodoro Barbosa, who fought relentlessly against the Ubazas Indians, settlers of the region and who are said to be the most accurate macana archery marksmen.  Conquest and colonization  The main original nuclei existing by the lands crossed by Mart√≠n Galeano are the following: Agataes, with Chipat√° as head, and the clans and rancherios in Guavat√°, Ubas√°, G√ºepsa and some other points: Yarigu√≠es or Lloriqu√≠es, watered by the mountainous area that extends long behind V√©lez to the north; the Guanes and Chanchones by the oriental margin of the Sarabita River and slopes of the Mochuelo or Fonce; and something more to the east the Chalalaes or Charal√°s. Neither one nor the other was concentrated in large populations. They were clans or family groups scattered here and there, with dialects and customs often dissimilar. For that reason Galeano and its people took a slip when they undertook their campaign, they thought to find great towns and a lot of gentility, at the end they only found a few groups and tough fighters.  Arrival of the conquerors  The conquistadors set foot on these lands for the first time in the year of 1539, when the conqueror Mart√≠n Galeano, following the orders of Don Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, visited the Santanderean mountains in which he had to find some similar to those of V√©lez (Spain). Mart√≠n Galeano, after having passed through different Guanes territories and fought several battles with the Indians, in May 1539 camped on the banks of the Suarez River where today is Cite. The mission was to found the city of V√©lez, but circumstances did not allow and after citing several names for this camp they managed to reach an agreement and called it Cite. The soldiers encamped in this place, exhausted by fatigue, began to wonder the name that they would put saying ... \\"Partner Cite yourself a name, Cite yourself a name\\" The region was inhabited by the Ubasas Indians who were said to be the most accurate arrow shooters with bow and its name of Barbosa is due to the name of Captain Helidoro Barbosa, who fought an intense battle with the tribe and fought relentlessly, in which the Spaniards were on the verge of succumbing and after several days of intense battles they were victorious, for that reason Mart√≠n Galeano, in recognition of the value demonstrated by the commander, commanded to raise a bridge on the Suarez river which he called precisely \\"Puente Barbosa\\" , planting this name for the first time in the region. Among the first inhabitants of Barbosa who sat his plant in these rich regions are the families of surnames Becar√≠a, Camacho, Escamilla, Ulloa, Moncada, Chaparro, Fajardo, Cely, R√≠os and Gonz√°lez.  Geography  Geographical review The municipality of Barbosa is located in the extreme south of the Department of Santander, in limits with the department of Boyac√°, in the province of V√©lez and Ricaurte, on the banks of the Suarez River between the mountains that make up the Eastern Cordillera, at a distance of the capital of the country of 190 km and of Bucaramanga to 214 km. Territorially it has a strategic location on the main national paved road No. 45 that connects Bogota with Bucaramanga, so Barbosa is known as the \\"Puerta de Oro de Santander\\".

It is one of the towns in the province of Garc√≠a Rovira on the banks of the Chicamocha River. It is located 197 km from the departmental capital, Bucaramanga and 35 km from M√°laga Capital of the province. and 189 km from the city of Tunja; and 136 km from Duitama \\"Troncal central del Norte\\" highway. Route 55 History In the Pre-Hispanic era, the beautiful Chicamocha Valley was populated by a group of natives, which the Spaniards called CHITAREROS and extended their dominions in most of the current Province of Garc√≠a Rovira, reaching Pamplona and the western part of T√°chira State. Venezuela. The conquistadors who came to the territory where the town of Capitanejo is located, found a group of indigenous Chitareros, led by \\"Don Bernabe,\\" Cacique Chicamocha \\"and in his honor gave the name to these with Chicamocha Indians, from there also the Name of the region, and the name of the river, which in the beginning was called Rio Grande. The name Chicamocha is an indigenism, which bears close similarity with other names of the Chibcha linguistic family, such as Chibchac√∫n and Chiminigagua, the Muisca gods. These clever aborigines had already set up LA CUBAYA or TARABITA, which allowed them to safely cross the Rio Grande, to communicate with their neighbors the Muiscas, Laches and Guanes. The administration of CABUYA was exercised by the Chicamocha Indians; right they defended during the conquest and the Colony. The system of the cabuya or tarabita still subsists in Capitanejo, because today it is still used to cross the rivers Chicamocha, Nevado and Servit√°, in the riverside paths where there are no bridges. and it is also cataloged as an extreme sport. In 1597 a \\"Royal Certificate\\" gave the Dominican Fathers the \\"doctrine\\" of the valley of Chicamocha, where they remained almost 200 years, the Dominicans were the first evangelizers of these regions. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was established in the region, thanks to the benefits of the lands that were granted by President Don Juan de Borja, three Canarian immigrants who played an important role in the First Parish Erection in Capitanejo: The Captain Don Bartolom√© de Aguilar, Father Juan Bautista Garc√≠a and the nephew of both Crist√≥bal Verde de Aguilar. These men were the promoters of the parish foundation, their support and the beginning of life as a people in that area. The three men came from the Canary Islands a Spanish colony at that time. Name of Capitanejo The recent conformed town of chicamocha, soon happened to be called THE CAPITANEJO. This name, says Father Ismael Mej√≠a in his unpublished notes, was given by Don Crist√≥bal Verde de Aguilar who held the CAPTAIN title, and has an intimate relationship with his title. It means then, to the similarity to CAPTAIN, in honor of its founding CAPTAINS. Geography Capitanejo is located in the East of the Department. with an extension of 81 km 2. It has an average altitude of 1090 masl with a dry warm climate at a temperature of 25 C. It is located 197 km from the city of Bucaramanga by difficult road that connects the towns of San Jos√© de Miranda, M√°laga City. San Andr√©s, Guaca and Piedecuesta city to get to the Capital. Bucaramanga The distance between Capitanejo and M√°laga Capital of the Province is 34.5 km with a travel time of 50 minutes. The distance of Capitanejo with the capital of the country Bogot√° is 328 km paved road. with a travel time of 6 hours. Ecology Due to its dry warm climate, it has a vegetation where the magical carpet that can be seen when Capitanejo is seen in the distance, is a great variety of crops such as: tobacco, tomato, melon and sugarcane; wildly we find trees or shrubs such as: the cuj√≠, moral, chicken, yabo, mion, yurumo, totumo, tree bread, fig, acacias, mulato, oreganillo, yatago, some fruit such as mam√≥n, coconut, zapote, avocado, mango, orange, tangerine, papaya, guayaba, congolos, passion fruit, sweet lemon, anon, tamarind, guanabana, guama and watermelon, another vegetation that characterizes and identifies the municipality are the cactus varieties known as tunos, as well as a unique species of large spines known as guas√°baras. Of its wildlife, we can say that there are snakes such as coral and jackets among others; iguanas, lizards, faras, weasels, owls, hawks and birds of great variety such as tiles, mirlas, toches, turpiales, coha, swallows, redheads, copetones, pispirillos and pigeons (Torcaza). In the high parts of the town there are foxes, partridges, rabbits, squirrels and tinajos. In times of uplift of the Chicamocha river presents fish: Bocachico, chocuas or coroncoro, nicuro, but due to the high degree of pollution of the river these species are in danger of extinction. Economy The production of Capitanejo is purely agricultural, its main production is the cultivation of tobacco, which generates great economic movement in the municipality and other neighboring towns, produces direct income to the peasant farmer who celebrates a contract of sale with the tobacco companies (Philip Morris International and the British American Tobacco), who are in charge of providing technical assistance, cash loans for the maintenance of the harvest as well as the basic supplies and tools and the benefit of the sheet. A local trade is developed where the sale of products and services is carried out, represented in grocery stores and groceries, restaurants whose specialty is the sweaty goat and the pepitoria, hotels that meet the demand of visitors and people passing by, snack bars, drugstores, fast foods and fritangas, hardware stores, miscel√°neas, stationeries, stores of clothes and footwear and like greater characterization the traditional taverns where the beer is consumed, drink very desired by the warmth of the climate, with places of relaxation like billiards, fields of bolus and the frequent galleras that characterize Capitanejo. Indirectly employment is generated in the transport of both the harvesters and the raw material, for the time of collection and sale increases the economic income to restaurants, service stations, warehouses and food depots. As for retail, the municipality is based on small grocery stores, informal clothing stores, bakeries, service stations, carpentry shops, electrical decoration workshops, shoe repair and ice cream shops. Goat and Cattle Activity The livestock farms in Capitanejo play a very important role from the economic, social and cultural point of view.

They are considered the indigenous people of their lands, which was later settled by so-called \\"Nubians\\". They speak Aringa language, a Central Sudanic language. Aringa, like the neighboring Kakwa people, were blamed by other groups in Uganda for doing Idi Amin's \\"dirty work\\" in the 1970s. Amin was a Kakwa and his vice president, Mustafa Adrisi, an Aringa. After the Uganda-Tanzania War and the demise of Amin's regime in 1979, Aringa were persecuted by the joint Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) and Tanzania People's Defence Force. This caused them to scatter, some to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, some to Sudan, and the rest throughout Uganda. Until they began drifting back to their villages eight or ten years later, Aringa county was almost completely depopulated.Myrtle Grove Presbyterian Church: Adopt the Aringa People ReliefWeb: The Anguish of Northern Uganda - Section 2 When the Tanzanian occupying forces were replaced by the UNLA in 1980, the UNLA engaged in brutal reprisals against the local civilian population, who were considered supporters of ex-Amin forces. In late 1980, guerrillas consisting of former Amin forces invaded from southern Sudan and forced some UNLA units out of the West Nile region. They included the Uganda National Rescue Front, based principally among the Aringa people, and the Former Uganda National Army, based mainly among the Kakwa. This led the UNLA to engage in further reprisals, large-scale destruction of property, and massacres in both Arua and Moyo District, leading as many as 500,000 West Nile civilians, including Aringa, to flee to Sudan. Many remained in refugee camps in Sudan until the late 1980s when the National Resistance Army took power in Uganda.

It is soluble in water and available as a stabilized solution at neutral pH and immobilized onto an agarose support to facilitate removal of the reducing agent. Applications TCEP is often used as a reducing agent to break disulfide bonds within and between proteins as a preparatory step for gel electrophoresis. Compared to the other two most common agents used for this purpose (dithiothreitol and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol), TCEP has the advantages of being odorless, a more powerful reducing agent, an irreversible reducing agent (in the sense that TCEP does not regenerate‚Äîthe end product of TCEP-mediated disulfide cleavage is in fact two free thiols/cysteines), more hydrophilic, and more resistant to oxidation in air.TCEP technical information, from Interchim It also does not reduce metals used in immobilized metal affinity chromatography. TCEP is particularly useful when labeling cysteine residues with maleimides. TCEP can keep the cysteines from forming di-sulfide bonds and unlike dithiothreitol and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, it will not react as readily with the maleimide. However, TCEP has been reported to react with maleimide under certain conditions. TCEP is also used in the tissue homogenization process for RNA isolation. For Ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy applications, TCEP is useful when it is important to avoid interfering absorbance from 250 to 285 nanometers which can occur with dithiothreitol.

The original music score was composed by Maurice Jarre. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Plot Terry Dean (Paul Hogan), a professional burglar specialized in sabotaging electronic surveillance systems, stands before his release from yet another stint in prison. Following a fellow inmate's suggestion, he decides to switch to bank robbery instead, with a special twist of his own design: first by having the security cameras record TV shows he would connect them to with a modified remote control, then entering disguised as a celebrity; the confusion over this unexpected appearance would serve to confound a detailed description. Terry's first heist (disguised as Willie Nelson) is successful, but shortly afterwards he witnesses a young boy about to be overrun by a van; he impulsively pushes the child away and is himself hit. While in the hospital, he has a nebulous experience (which may have been caused by Highway to Heaven playing on the room's TV) in which he meets God (Charlton Heston; this is used as a pun later on) who introduces himself as Terry's 'probation helper'. Though Terry has lived a sinful life, his last deed, impulsive as it was, has earned him a second chance to save his soul - by doing God's work as an angel in training. After reawakening, Terry tries another bank hold-up (this time disguised as Rod Stewart), but a stroke of luck occurs and a gang of amateur robbers interfere. As they escape, one of the thugs tries to shoot Terry, but gun was loaded with blanks by one of the other thugs. Thinking himself to be an immortal angel now, Terry reconsiders his ways, seeks advice in a church, and then he follows several 'signs' to another town. In a bar, he meets Steve Garner (Elias Koteas), an embittered young man confined to a wheelchair by a terminal sickness. To bring Steve out of his self-pity, Terry engages him in a fist-fight on equal terms, sitting fixed on a stool. Steve, taken with Terry's acceptance of him as a person, not a cripple, strikes up a friendship with Terry and offers him a place to stay at the youth center for children and teens, which he runs with his sister Rose (Linda Kozlowski). Rose is at first suspicious about Terry, but Terry proves himself by slyly intimidating two drug dealers into leaving the center's area and helping out as much as he can, and Rose gradually falls in love with him. The center itself, however, is in financial difficulties, since its backer George Bealeman (Parley Baer), while claiming himself to be a faithful Christian, refuses to provide any more funds. Since he has no angel's powers, Terry uses his technical know-how to convince Bealeman otherwise: by recording and re-editing a segment from TV evangelist Rev. Barton's (Ben Slack) telecast (which Bealeman watches reverently), and fitting the cross at the rooftop of the center's church with lighting effects, triggered by his universal remote. At the evening where Bealeman drops by, however, two police detectives close in on Terry. Steve, who happens to overhear them, rushes off in his wheelchair to warn Terry, but during the flight he injures himself critically, slowly bleeding to death. Just after Bealeman has left, he arrives at the center, and while Rose runs to calls an ambulance, Steve delivers his warning. Afraid of death, Steve feels lost, but is reassured he will find a place in Heaven when Terry uses the remote to trigger the lighted cross, creating a sign from God. No longer afraid of death, Steve dies in the arms of Terry and Rose. Terry then announces that he has to leave, and trying to comfort Rose, he reveals that he is \\"almost an angel\\". Rose is understandably skeptical, but after Terry leaves, she checks his universal remote which he had left her as a keepsake, only to discover that it contains no batteries. As she stares up at the cross it nevertheless begins to shine brilliantly on its own. She runs after Terry and calls out to him. Distracted, Terry slips and falls right before a speeding truck and is about to be run over. Rose is shocked to witness that the truck passes right though him, proving he was really an angel all along. Having passed his angel's exam, Terry continues on his quest to do God's work (though not without promising to return), and Rose is left comforted at last. CastReception The film had a mostly negative reception. It currently holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Box office The film was also a commercial failure. It grossed just under $7 million in ticket sales on a $25 million budget.

It has polar fimbriae and is the causative agent of ovine foot rot as well as interdigital dermatitis. It is the lone species in the genus Dichelobacter.  Cellular Morphology and Biochemistry  History  Epidemiology  Footrot is one of top five globally important diseases acquired by sheep [8]. The primary obligate agent for causing disease is Dichelobacter nodosus, although unclear Fusobacterium necrophorum has been reported for establishment of disease or acts as a secondary opportunistic pathogen[14]. Outbreaks have been reported in Australia, Britain, Norway, Switzerland [8][12][13]. This bacterium has a global distribution year-round with characteristic highly transmissible peaks occurring in temperate zones where there is adequate moisture and an ambient temperature above 10 degrees [9][11]. In cooler conditions, like spring and autumn higher disease prevalence can be observed in the UK and Ireland [8]. This bacterium has the ability to thrive in moist soil for up to two weeks. In the presence of optimal conditions the bacterium can live up to 24 days in at least 5 degrees Celsius. In suboptimal conditions animals will not demonstrate full clinical presentation and mild lesions may be confined to the interdigital skin. Detection of a lower prevalence and persistence occurs in dry warm climates compared to wet cool conditions [11]. Sheep and goats are the main species affected by the bacterium and are susceptible at all ages. Merino appear to be more susceptible over British breeds of sheep. British breeds appear to carry more natural resistance, displaying mild clinical signs of a short duration. Although first cross offspring under the correct conditions can develop severe clinical disease. Cattle can become affected although normally only suffer a mild form of infection. Wild ungulates have been reported to carrying the bacterium in Germany and Switzerland [11]. There lies challenges to isolate D. nodosus as more molecular based studies need to be conducted to differentiate persistence in a domesticated farm environment [8].

The Utah section runs east‚Äìwest for approximately across the central part of the state. Richfield is the largest Utah city served by the freeway, which does not serve or connect any urban areas in the state. The freeway was built as part of a system of highways connecting Los Angeles and the northeastern United States. I-70 was the second attempt to connect southern California to the east coast of the United States via central Utah, the first being a failed attempt to construct a transcontinental railroad. Parts of that effort were re-used in the laying out of the route of I-70. Unlike most Interstate Highways, much of I-70 in Utah was not constructed parallel to or on top of an existing U.S. Highway. Portions of I-70 were constructed in areas where previously there were no paved roads. Because it was built over an entirely new route, I-70 has many features that are unique in the Interstate Highway System. For example, the between Green River and Salina makes up the longest distance anywhere in the Interstate Highway System with no motorist services. This same piece is noted as the longest highway in the United States built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway, and the longest piece of Interstate Highway to open at a given time. The construction of the Utah portion of I-70 is listed as one of the engineering marvels of the Interstate Highway System. The choice of the route had a significant impact on the character and culture of the Sevier Valley. It has also been a motivating factor for environmentalists to create a new National Park along the path of the highway to protect scenic areas around the route. I-70 from Green River to Grand Junction, Colorado is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway, making I-70 one of the few Interstate Highways to be named a National Scenic Byway. Attractions listed by the Federal Highway Administration for the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway on or near I-70 include, Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Goblin Valley State Park and Westwater. The designation lists several side roads branching from I-70 that lead to dinosaur bones or footprints. Route description I-70 begins at a trumpet interchange with Interstate 15, near Cove Fort. It then proceeds east over the Pavant Range, cresting at Clear Creek Summit with an elevation of . The eastern descent from the Pavant range features bridges high above Clear Creek and its side canyons. The longest of these bridges is the Fish Creek bridge at long. Note: alternate site for data The descent into Clear Creek features a brake check area and runaway truck ramp to aid truckers down the steep slope. The freeway then skirts the edge of Fremont Indian State Park before entering Sevier Valley. Sevier Valley I-70 serves as the main thoroughfare of the valley, the only area traversed by the freeway in the state with more than a few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along the western edge of the valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535 vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89; both highways now run concurrently between exit 23 (US-89 south to Marysvale and Panguitch) and exit 56 in Salina. Wasatch Plateau alt=A highway snaking through a sandstone canyon that progressively narrows around the highway corridor At Salina, US-50 joins I-70, and the two highways run concurrent for the rest of the way through Utah. After leaving exit 56 in Salina, I-70 departs on a course to the first Green River offramp, exit 160. Though there are a number of exits in-between the two cities, this is the longest distance in the Interstate Highway System with no motorist services directly along the highway. The route to Green River crosses two major geographic obstacles, the Wasatch Plateau and the San Rafael Swell. I-70 ascends the Wasatch Plateau via Salina Canyon. The top of the canyon is the highest point of any of Utah's Interstate Highways, although the elevation differs from source to source. The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) has listed the elevation at and . Other maps have listed the figure . At least one map has given this point a name, Emigrant Pass. This portion of I-70 is on protected lands as part of Fishlake National Forest. The freeway exits the Wasatch Plateau at Fremont Junction, the name of the junction of I-70 with State Route 10 (SR-10). San Rafael Swell Between Fremont Junction and the junction of SR-24 near Green River, Interstate 70 crosses a geologic feature called the San Rafael Swell. The construction of the freeway through the swell is listed as one of the engineering marvels of the Interstate Highway System, with one engineer claiming this section as \\"one of the most significant highway construction feats of its time\\". The construction of I-70 through the swell required boring through many solid rock canyons, cliffs, and mountains. The swell is noted for its sheer canyons and rock formations and is home to a large amount of exposed dinosaur remains. This includes the largest known collection of Jurassic period dinosaur remains at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry at the north end of the swell. alt=A dusk picture of a steel arch bridge spanning a deep canyon. In the background the corner of a 2nd bridge is visible. The highway ascends the western edge of the swell on a steady slope loosely following the north rim of Devils Canyon. At the top of the grade is a view area with a view of Devils Canyon and an overlook of the country west of the swell. It then crosses Eagle Canyon via a pair of steel arch bridges. The eastbound bridge is long Note: alternate site for National Bridge Inventory data. and the westbound bridge is long. Note: alternate site for National Bridge Inventory data. The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, the highest point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area overlooking the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes to the north of Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River. Book Cliffs alt=A blue sign against a desert landscape. The sign reads \\"Exit 162, next services on I-70 110 miles\\". West of Green River, US-6 and 191 join I-70. Also at Green River, the freeway reaches the southern edge of the Book Cliffs, a mountain range which I-70 follows to Grand Junction, Colorado. This portion of I-70 is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway, recognized as a scenic byway by both the National Scenic Byways and Utah Scenic Byways programs. Listed attractions along the byway in the Green River area include Crystal Geyser, Capitol Reef National Park and Green River State Park. Looking west on I-70 across Sagers Flat From this point east the freeway is routed across a flat area between the Book Cliffs and the Colorado River, called Sagers Flat. Along the way it passes by the towns of Crescent Junction, Thompson Springs and Cisco. Natural features visible from this portion include Arches National Park and Castle Valley. Other listed attractions along the byway near this section include Canyonlands National Park and various areas with Morrison Formation, a layer of rock where dinosaur remains are common. I-70, US-6, and US-50 all enter Colorado concurrently. Where I-70 follows the Book Cliffs, it was built parallel to or on top of US-6/50. History=Old Spanish Trail The first route through this portion of Utah was the Old Spanish Trail, a trade route between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. The trail was in common use before the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848. Although the trail serves a different route than I-70, they were both intended to connect southern California with points further east. I-70 generally parallels the route of the Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction. I-15 south of the junction with I-70 also generally parallels the trail. Transcontinental railroads The first attempt to build a modern trade route through the area is credited to William Jackson Palmer, founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RG;). Palmer started a project in 1880 to make what had been a local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D&RG; in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad. alt=a row of sandstone fins towering over a semi-trailer and speed limit sign. Disagreements in the company led to two proposals. Both proposals called for extending the railroad west from Colorado as far as what is now Green River. West of Green River a \\"northern route\\" would extend the railroad towards Ogden, Utah, there connecting with the established Overland Route. This proposal was eventually completed as the Utah Division, loosely following the route of modern U.S. Route 6 across eastern Utah. This line soon became the main line of the D&RG; and remains one of the main transcontinental rail arteries of the U.S, now operated by the Union Pacific Railroad as the Central Corridor. The second proposal was a \\"southern route\\" that would continue due west from Green River and head towards Los Angeles, similar to the route of modern I-70. This proposal would require extending the railroad farther west, to connect with what would become the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. alt=A mountain made from two layers of sandstone, the lower layer is a light color, while the upper layer is dark red. Due to disagreements in management and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon obvious that the southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology available at the time and the rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell. The D&RG; spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6 million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded it would have been the shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S. Construction resumed in 1901 on a portion of the southern route, to build a spur line to service coal mines on the Wasatch Plateau. The railroad branched from an existing line at Salina and traveled east up Salina Canyon. After the mines closed, the railroad bed was used to improve State Route 10, between Salina and Fremont Junction. I-70 would later use the railroad bed for a path across the Wasatch Plateau. Plans for Interstate 70 By the time the Interstate Highway System was in the planning stages, no paved road had yet entered the San Rafael Swell. The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the swell. alt=Panorama of a desert landscape with a canyon running through the center of the picture. As first proposed in 1956, the western terminus of I-70 was Denver, Colorado. Officials from Colorado pressured the federal government to extend the plans for I-70 further west. After several discussions with Utah officials, Utah supported an extension that would follow US-6/50 (now US-6), to connect with I-15 at Spanish Fork. This proposal would connect the Salt Lake City area with Denver. While accepting the Colorado/Utah proposal, federal planners also decided to show a modified proposal, with the terminus of I-70 at Cove Fort, to planners at the Department of the Army. The planners opposed the extension to Salt Lake, but felt the modified proposal would benefit the U.S. Army, by providing a better connection to southern California. The new route would shorten the distance between Los Angeles and Denver by about . The route to Cove Fort was approved on October 18, 1957. A general announcement was made, with no prior notice given to Utah officials of the modification. The commissioner of the Bureau of Public Roads later admitted that the lack of notice was intentional, fearing infighting if the bureau did not announce a final decision. A state historian stated the news hit Utah \\"like a bombshell\\". Except for the officials in Utah that represented the area, most opposed a freeway that would serve no populated areas in the state. The route was mocked as a public relations blunder and a \\"road to nowhere\\". Utah officials attempted to revert plans to their preferred alternative, but later resigned to construct I-70 on the federally selected route. Governor George Dewey Clyde concluded, \\"Utah had no choice but to accept the Cove Fort routing, or have none at all.\\" Even attempts to route the freeway slightly north, to serve more cities in Emery County, were blocked. Federal planners insisted the freeway pass Green River on a southwest course and not turn north. Even today, there is no direct interstate link between Salt Lake City and Denver. Motorists must choose between the two lane routes (US-6 or US-40) or detour on I-80 through Wyoming. Construction alt=Shield for State Route 4 With the plans for I-70 extended, a transcontinental route would again be attempted across the San Rafael Swell. The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked what they were doing. The rancher fell over laughing when he was told they were building a freeway. The survey crew did not use the route of the railroad past the San Rafael Reef. However, they did use the route of the railroad across the Wasatch Plateau. The construction crews destroyed two of four tunnels when the bed was widened for the freeway. The two remaining tunnels are visible just south of the freeway and are used by a frontage road. Some portions of I-70 over the Pavant Range and Wasatch Plateau were opened to traffic before the portion over the San Rafael Swell. These portions were temporarily signed as State Route 4. The portion over the San Rafael Swell opened to traffic in 1970, finally making the Utah portion of I-70 a drivable route. Interstate 70 was dedicated on December 5, 1970, at the Ghost Rocks view area inside the swell, even though it would take another 20 years to fully complete the freeway. At the ceremony the mayors of cities recently made neighbors, including Grand Junction, Colorado, introduced themselves. Then Governor Cal Rampton noted that I-70 was the longest road the U.S. had built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway, during World War II. It was also noted this was the longest piece of the Interstate Highway System to open at a given time. alt=hundreds of sandstone hoodoos protruding from the desert floor. Initially only two lanes, now the eastbound lanes, through the swell were constructed. The official highway map for Utah noted the new freeway, but qualified its existence with the words \\"two lanes open\\". The first portions of I-70 to be constructed to Interstate Highway standards were along the non- disputed portion of the route east of Green River. The Utah portion of I-70 was not completed to Interstate Highway standards until 1990, when the second Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated. A second dedication ceremony was held at the bridge declaring the Utah portion of I-70 complete. Archie Hamilton, one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) long enough to see I-70 progress from conception to completion, said the most memorable moment was seeing the excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon. He said before construction began, he could stand in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon. To carve the first through the canyon required excavating of rock. It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $183.5 million, $105.5 million (1970, $595 million in 2008) to build the first two lanes, and $78 million (1990, $130 million in 2008) to construct the rest. At the 1970 dedication, it was noted the cost of land acquisition helped to offset the cost of the massive excavation. UDOT acquired the right of way to build the majority of I-70 from the BLM at the lowest cost per mile of any highway in Utah. Effect on rural Utah In 2002, the Salt Lake Tribune interviewed the mayor of Richfield about the change I-70 brought to the Sevier Valley. Previously these were isolated farming communities, whose residents felt they were unaccustomed to the crime and other effects that a transcontinental highway can bring. Residents of Richfield soon started to call I-70 \\"Cocaine Lane\\". The mayor stated that I-70 is a mixed blessing. He stated the highway is a boon to the hospitality industry and has made Richfield more accessible to other cities. However, the new road brought types of crime previously unknown to the city. The mayor lamented that after the completion of I-70, many residents started locking their doors for the first time. The interview resulted from an event that served as a \\"wake-up call\\", that rural Utah is \\"not isolated from crime\\". Panic ensued after the public witnessed Utah Highway Patrol troopers carrying away a suspect in handcuffs, while removing plastic bags and coolers full of body parts from the trunk of his car. The event caused a frenzy of people checking on their neighbors, fearing the murder victims were local residents. In 2007, there were 11 violent crimes in Sevier County, a county of 19,386 residents. Green River is the largest, and only incorporated city directly served by I-70 in eastern Utah. Unlike the communities of the Sevier Valley, Green River was founded as a stopover for travelers along transcontinental arteries. The area was first used as a stopover for travelers navigating the Green River. Later the town was formed to serve travelers along the Old Spanish Trail and stagecoach mail routes. Green River was an established stopover by the time the railroad and later highways were built through the area. Effect on the San Rafael Swell alt=Panorama with coral pick sand and a few rock features on the right side of the image. Before the construction of I-70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935. Since the construction of the freeway the number of visitors to the swell has increased significantly, as the swell can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation. A major push occurred in 2002 when officials from Emery County, joined by Utah governor Mike Leavitt, petitioned President George W. Bush to use the authority of the Antiquities Act and create a San Rafael Swell National Monument. This effort lost momentum after the governor promised to honor the wishes of Emery County residents via a non-binding referendum, which did not pass. Common reasons given by residents for opposing the designation included fear of the federal government restricting access and a repetition of events that occurred with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This monument was established in 1996, by President Bill Clinton. In that case the monument was proposed at the federal level in secret. Boundaries were drawn without the consent or even knowledge of local residents. This incited anger and triggered a backlash in rural Utah. Currently most of the swell is administered by the BLM and is not given special consideration. A small portion on the eastern edge is protected as Goblin Valley State Park, administered by the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation. Today the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance continues to lobby for protection. Route number changes Before the formation of I-70, there was a road over the Pavant Range numbered SR-13 that was similar to the route of I-70. The highway, which largely still exists as a two-lane road between SR-161 (former US-91) at Cove Fort and US-89 at Sevier, had been taken over by the state on August 2, 1912, and assigned the label by the early 1920s as part of Utah's initial highway numbering. In the Wasatch Plateau, the base for I-70 was derived from a portion of SR-10. Both of these were transferred to State Route 4, which was the state legislative designation for all of I-70 in Utah, in 1962. U.S. Route 50 was changed to overlap with Interstate 70 through most of Utah in 1976, with U.S. Route 6 remaining on its former route. In 1977, Utah renumbered its state routes so that the legislative and signed numbers would match. With this change, the state designation for Interstate 70 is now State Route 70.

The Bowie interlocking tower, no longer operational, has been restored and is part of the Huntington Railroad Museum. The Pope's Creek Subdivision is a CSX Transportation railroad line in Maryland, running from Bowie to Morgantown where the Morgantown Generating Station is located and the Chalk Point Generating Station.http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/P0-Popes_Creek_Sub  History  The Pope's Creek Subdivision was originally built by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. The company was organized on December 19, 1858, and began surveying the route May 3, 1859. Construction started in 1861 but progressed slowly until 1867, when the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and its ally, the Northern Central Railway (NCRY), bought the company. The PRR at the time had access to Baltimore via its own lines: the NCRY from the north and the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad from the northeast. However, it used the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) and its Washington Branch to continue southwest to Washington, D.C. The PRR and B&O; were rivals, and the Maryland General Assembly refused to grant a charter to end the B&O;'s monopoly on Baltimore-Washington travel. However, the existing Baltimore and Potomac charter allowed exactly that, via the clause that allowed branches; all the PRR had to do was to take the line within 20 miles (32 km) of Washington. The PRR obtained a charter for the section in Washington on February 5, 1867. Thus the new Baltimore-Washington line opened on July 2, 1872, and the required \\"main line\\" to Pope's Creek on the Potomac River, immediately relegated to branch status, opened on January 1, 1873. Passenger service from Bowie to Pope's Creek ended on October 29, 1949. Ownership of the line passed from the PRR to the Penn Central Transportation Company in 1968 and to Conrail in 1976. When Conrail was split in 1999, CSX Transportation was assigned the line.  Current operation  The Pope's Creek Subdivision currently runs from its interchange at Bowie with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor main line, to the Morgantown and Chalk Point Generating Stations. A wye track exists to allow trains to enter Amtrak's main line and go north or south, so that a second engine or cab car is not needed. Amtrak limits these trains to late night/very early morning runs and no more than 160 cars. The line is mostly single tracked, with long sidings in Collington, Upper Marlboro and Brandywine. At Brandywine the Herbert Subdivision branches off, carrying a single track to the GenOn Chalk Point Power Station. http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/HB-Herbert_Sub http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/CSX/CSX%20ETTs/CSX%20Baltimore%20Div%20ETT%20%234%201-1-2005.pdf CSX Baltimore Division TimetableIf the train continues straight through Brandywine, it will reach the Morgantown Generating Station. This line currently hosts 2 to 3 trains a day (a down-and-back coal train and an occasional local freight train serving a few businesses in the Waldorf and La Plata area). The Navy spur that branched off at White Plains (between Waldorf and La Plata) going over to Indian Head, was in service from 1918 into the 1960s. After decades of non-use and efforts to start a tourist railroad, the spur was converted to a rail trail in 2008.  Future conversion possibility The Maryland Transit Administration conducted a study in 2009 to evaluate the feasibility of MARC Train passenger service on this line.

The Yoshioka-ry≈´ became famous during the latter half of the 16th century when Yoshioka Kenpo (founder of Yoshioka-ry≈´) was assigned to be the sword instructor of the Ashikaga sh≈çguns in Kyoto. The Yoshioka-ry≈´ was founded in the first half of the Tenmon period (1532‚Äì1554) by Yoshioka Kenpo (Kenbo) Naomoto. Yoshioka Kenpo was originally a dyeworker and his family was famous for a special method to produce a unitary dark blue tone which could be produced in the same nuance every time. The tone was named after Yoshioka Kenpo and was called Kenpo-zome. Kenpo mastered his swordsmanship and developed his own fighting style which Kenpo led back to Kiichi Hogen's style and teachings, a semi-legendary samurai from the province of Mutsu-no-kuni who helped Minamoto no Yoshitsune further his mastery in military arts (Bugei). Yoshioka Kenpo was renowned for his skills with the sword and became the official instructor of the sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshiharu (reigned from 1521‚Äì1545) in Kyoto. But it is said that Yoshioka Kenpo had no honorable death. It is said that Kenpo was hurt incidentally with a stick by a Noh actor during a performance at the sh≈çguns castle. Kenpo left the scenery humiliated. The shame for not being able to defend himself from the incidental attack of the actor was too great for the sword master and instructor of the sh≈çgun. Soon after, Kenpo came back and killed the actor in public with a sword which he had smuggled into the castle under his clothes. Since the usage of weapons of any kind was strictly forbidden at the court on pain of death, Kenpo was declared a criminal and pursued. Before Yoshioka Kenpo was killed, he killed many of his pursuers. Nonetheless, Yoshioka Kenpo had built the foundation for one of the most famous Kenjutsu ry≈´ (sword fighting styles) of Kyoto, led by his children and grandchildren. However, the Yoshioka-ry≈´ did not last longer than four generations. When the sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru (reigning from 1546‚Äì1565) once started a comparison fight between the Yoshioka and Shinmen Munisai (father of Miyamoto Musashi), Shinmen Munisai won 2:1. This battle caused a crucial feud between both families. Just one generation later, Miyamoto Musashi's wins against Yoshioka Seij≈´r≈ç and Yoshioka Denshichir≈ç, and his assassination of Yoshioka Matashichiro ended the feud and led to the decline of the Yoshioka in 1604 (according to Nitenki, a historical record written by a student of Miyamoto Musashi). In popular culture The Takehiko Inoue manga Vagabond has a variation on the feud between Musashi and the Yoshioka. Musashi had sought them out as a way to leapfrog his way to fame, slaying a few disciples at the d≈çj≈ç before Seij≈´r≈ç arrived and exposed him as lacking. Nevertheless, he continued to challenge and dueled Denshichir≈ç, but their first encounter ended prematurely on account of the Yoshioka d≈çj≈ç being inadvertently set aflame, so Denshichir≈ç told Musashi to grow stronger and then face him a year later. Nearly a year later, when Musashi accepted a more formal challenge from Denshichir≈ç, Seij≈´r≈ç attempted to kill Musashi at Rendaiji field on New Year's Day without informing anyone possibly due to believing that Denshichir≈ç could not defeat Musashi. However, Musashi defended himself and slew Seij≈´r≈ç on New Year's Day. Denshichir≈ç would be mentally traumatized at the sight of his older brother's body and soon started to lose practice bouts to his nominal students, leading the disciple Ueda Ry≈çhei to plot to have Sasaki Kojir≈ç act as a substitute, only for Ry≈çhei to be expelled by Denshichir≈ç for this. At the duel, Musashi was delayed by Ry≈çhei threatening him with revenge should he win but had so advanced as a swordsman as to defeat Denshichir≈ç fairly and with relative ease, killing the second brother at Rengeoin temple. Ry≈çhei's expulsion only lasted until Denshichir≈ç's death, after which he returned and became head of the school/family. (There is no third biological brother in Vagabond, where Ueda Ry≈çhei had been adopted by one of Kenpo's disciples, and even before Denshichir≈ç's death he had the support of at least a sizable number of the Yoshioka swordsmen.) Ry≈çhei's next plot to have all seventy of the Yoshioka swordsmen ambush Musashi at Ichijouji field proved to be the school's undoing: Musashi overheard the plot only for Ry≈çhei to formally challenge him without changing the plan or at least preparing the Yoshioka swordsmen for what was essentially a murder plot that had been given away. As a result, Musashi ended the Yoshioka school by literally destroying the school's membership in that final encounter.

Unseen is a naval thriller published in 1999 by Patrick Robinson; it is the third book in the series featuring Admiral Arnold Morgan, and marks the return of Ben Adnam. It is stylistically similar to Tom Clancy, particularly his The Hunt for Red October. The book differs from the previous two in the series in that it focuses less on the plot and heroes and spends more time on the character development of villain Ben Adnam. Plot summary As hinted at the end of Nimitz Class, Ben Adnam is alive and well. Having returned to Iraq, he is awarded a medal, but also suffers a betrayal. He flees Iraq and offers his services to Iran. He devises a plan to cripple Transatlantic air travel. The plan first requires capturing HMS Unseen‚Äîthe last of the \\"quietest subs in the world\\"‚Äîthe Upholder class. He combines this with a defunct missile system, and creates a weapon capable of knocking any aircraft out of the sky without detection. The plan works perfectly and several aircraft, including \\"Air Force Three\\" carrying the Vice President, are destroyed. However, Ben is abandoned by the Iranians and so left to fend for himself. He comes up with a scheme to meet the man who has hunted him for so long, Admiral Morgan, in order to offer his services to the US. During their confrontation, Adnam informs Morgan that Iraq was behind the terrorist attacks and suggests that the destruction of some dams in the country is sufficient retribution. The US destroy these dams and Baghdad ends up beneath four feet of water. In the Epilogue, Ben Adnam, having been given a permanent job and a US passport, decides to come clean and inform Morgan that it was actually under the flag of Iran that he had destroyed the airlines. A furious Morgan terminates Adnam's employment but gives him the option of taking his own life, rather than have a SWAT team do it for him. With nowhere left to run, Adnam positions himself in the traditional east-facing position of Muslim prayer before shooting himself in the head. Ben Adnam Ben Adnam is somewhat unusual among techno thriller villains in that he is neither captured nor are any of his attacks thwarted by the \\"good guys\\"; even his death is at his own hands. This has led to claims that the books are actually a satire of the genre which often feature perfect heroes and despicable but one dimensional villains.

The book has sold more than two million copies in Japan. A bilingual Japanese and English version, translated by Giles Murray, was published in Japan in May 2007 by IBC Publishing under the English title The Dignity of the Nation. Overview The title of the book mimics the title of a nationalist pamphlet issued by the Japanese government in 1937. The Dignity of a State criticizes the emphasis on Western logic and individuality in Japanese society, and calls for a return to the value system of bushido. It criticizes democracy, citing Adolf Hitler as an example of a leader using democracy to manipulate citizens. It also criticizes the market economy, which Fujiwara claims is widening the economic gap between the wealthy and impoverished in Japan, and globalism, which Fujiwara claims is only a \\"strategy of the U.S. that seeks world domination after the Cold War.\\" A recurring theme of the book is that American ideas of freedom and equality do not even work in the United States, so they should not be applied in Japanese society. Reception Andrew Rankin of The Japan Times agreed with some of Fujiwara's criticisms of Western morality, but pointed out that \\"you can listen to most of Fujiwara‚Äôs other ideas for free at any noodle stand in Japan.\\" The book's popularity made \\"hinkaku\\" (\\"dignity\\") the most popular buzzword of 2006 in Japan.

He apparently quickly worked independently then rejoined his friend and fellow Bolognese and Baglione pupil, Lionello Spada. Together during the early 17th century, they began to collaborate in quadratura, with Curti painting the structures, while Spada painted the figures. They soon parted, with Spada becoming a canvas painter, and Curti was to travel to paint in Modena, Parma (1618 and 1630), Rome (1623) and Genoa. He returned from Rome to Bologna, and there was assisted by Michelangelo Colonna, Agostino Mitelli, and Andrea Seghizzi, and painted architectural backgrounds for Guercino frescoes. Much of his work has been lost over the centuries. The main source of his biography is Cesare Malvasia, whose father's villa at Trebbio was frescoed by Curti and assistants.

Raised in southern Arizona and Rio Yaqui, Mexico, Anselmo adopted his second surname as a young man. ‚ÄùTori‚Äù is the family‚Äôs clan name. His wife was Kathy Ann () Nordin. Their marriage took place on April 26, 1992, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Early life Anselmo was born in Sonora, Mexico on April 21. 1921. His father was Francisco A. Valencia (b. 1885), and his mother was Placida Laborin (b. 1886). In 1930 the family lived in Bacad√©huachi, Sonora, a small village along the Bavispe River, which constitutes the upper stream of the Yaqui River. Anselmos's father worked in agriculture, and the economy of Bacad√©huachiis almost entirely based on agriculture and cattle raising, both of which are poorly developed due to the shortage of water. Along with his father and mother, Anselmo had three brothers and two sisters at this time. Accomplishments Anselmo was inducted into the United States Army on October 22, 1942, during the early part of World War II.\\"United States World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K85C-STG : 5 December 2014), Anselmo Valencia, enlisted 22 Oct 1942, Phoenix, Arizona, United States; citing \\"Electronic Army Serial Number Merged File, ca. 1938-1946,\\" database, The National Archives: Access to Archival Databases (AAD) (https://aad.archives.gov : National Archives and Records Administration, 2002); NARA NAID 1263923, National Archives at College Park, Maryland A veteran with only a Grammar school education, he became a teacher, tribal historian, and the political and spiritual leader of the Yaqui peoples. He was noted by the Arizona House of Representatives as the driving force behind the Yaqui tribe's efforts to obtain Federal recognition as well as historic tribe designation. An authority on Yaqui culture, he helped establish the non-profit Yoemem Tekia Foundation in 1989, which is dedicated to preserving and perpetuating Yaqui Indian culture. Tribal Rights He was a major political figure in the Yaqui tribe. In 1964 and 1965, serving as Executive Director of The Pascua Yaqui Association, he managed federal funds allocated through President Lyndon B. Johnson's newly founded Office of Economic Opportunity. The funds were used for new construction projects, including a church, and for adult education programs, vocational training, and summer youth programs. He strove to gain economic development opportunities as well as social and medical services. He also supported tribal efforts in the traditional Pueblos in Rio Yaqui, Sonora, Mexico. In addition, he worked toward achieving self- determination, tribal sovereignty, and human rights for the Pascua Yaqui. He did not recognize the political boundaries between Mexico and the United States, and waged long battles to gain land and water rights for the traditional pueblos in Rio Yaqui. Death Anselmo died in Tucson, Arizona on May 2, 1998. He was 77 years of age. He was interred at the Monte Calvario Cemetery in Tucson.

Known by various nicknames, including the \\"Clutching hand\\" and \\"Skyhook\\", many survived to be used as a civil light aircraft in the postwar era.Boughton 1963, p. 10. Design and development The DH.6 was specifically designed as a military trainer, at a time when it was usual for obsolete service types to be used in this role.Baker 1990, p. 24 Geoffrey de Havilland seems to have had two design criteria in mind.Jackson 1962, p. 53. The first was that it should be inexpensive and easy to build, and above all, simple to repair after the mishaps common in training units. The top and bottom wings were square-cut and interchangeable, hence roundels often located in unusual positions. They were heavily cambered, and braced with cables rather than streamlined wires. On the original version of the type there was no stagger. Even the fin and rudder, on the prototype of the usual curved de Havilland outline, were cut square on production machines. The fuselage structure was a straight box with no attempt at refinement of outline ‚Äì instructor and pupil sat in tandem on basketwork seats in a single cockpit, spartan even by the standards of the time. The standard engine was the readily available 90 hp (67 kW) RAF 1a. Because of its use in the B.E.2Cheeseman 1962, p. 48. the engine was familiar to RFC mechanics. No cowling was used, and upswept straight exhaust pipes were fitted. When stocks of the RAF 1a ran short, other engines were fitted, including the 80 hp (60 kW) Renault. The second design criterion was that the new trainer should be relatively safe to fly, both for the student and his instructor. RFC instructors at the time referred to student pilots as \\"Huns\\" (the term normally applied to German airmen) and casualties at training schools were high.Lee 1968 To improve safety the instructor could decouple the student's controls to avoid having to wrestle with him. The new trainer's flying characteristics were selected to achieve the desired safety. De Havilland had carried out extensive research into stability and control in aircraft while with the Royal Aircraft Factory, which helped in designing a safe but deliberately unstable aircraft. As a result, the DH.6 had very gentle flying characteristics and was probably the most \\"forgiving\\" aircraft of its time, allowing itself to be flown \\"crab wise\\" in improperly banked turns and able to maintain sustained flight at speeds as low as .Jackson 1987, p. 86. In fact, the DH.6 was described as \\"too safe\\" to make a good trainer,Cheeseman 1962, p. 60. as its reaction to inexpert piloting was too gentle to prepare pilots for combat aircraft such as the Sopwith Camel, whose handling was unusually difficult even for the era. With its low power, strong construction and lack of streamlining, its maximum speed was very low. Wartime production At least 2,282 DH.6s were built in the UK during the war, out of orders of about 3,000. Besides Airco, batches were built by Grahame-White, Kingsbury Aviation, Harland and Wolff, Morgan, Savages, Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies, and Gloucestershire. A single DH.6 was constructed in July 1917 by Canadian Aeroplanes Ltd. as a prototype for projected production, should supply of the Curtiss JN-4 (Can) prove inadequate, and it was the first British-designed aircraft built in Canada. In the event, the expected shortage of \\"Canucks\\" never materialized and only one example was built.Jackson 1987, p. 87. Operational history In 1917, training of RFC pilots began to receive a long overdue overhaul. The School of Special Flying at Gosport in Hampshire was established by Maj. Robert R. Smith-Barry with the aim of making flight instructors into specially trained experts ‚Äì rather than entrusting the role to novices who had barely completed their own training,W.E. Johns, later the creator of \\"Biggles\\" was one of many such \\"instructors\\" and operational pilots being \\"rested\\" to recover from combat fatigue. The Avro 504K was adopted as the standard trainer by the end of 1917, with the DH.6 becoming surplus as far as training was concerned. At the end of 1917, about 300 DH.6s were transferred to the RNAS for anti- submarine patrols. While far from ideal for this work, the type proved surprisingly \\"seaworthy\\", being known to float for as long as ten hours after ditching.Jackson 1987, p. 88. On operations, the underpowered trainer could not carry both an observer and weaponry. The majority of patrols were flown solo, allowing a token bomb load and a lightweight radio installation to be carried, although convoy escort missions generally carried an observer who could communicate with ships using an Aldis lamp.Jones 1937, p. 332. The \\"built in\\" instability designed to keep a student pilot alert proved tiring for pilots on long patrols over water, and experimental changes were made in mid-1918 to improve stability. These included the introduction of 10 in (25 cm) of back-stagger to wings of reduced chord and camber, with narrower elevators and rudder. DH.6s modified to this standard were unofficially dubbed \\"DH 6As\\". 1050 DH.6s were still on charge with the RAF on 31 October 1918.Bruce 1957, p. 191. Nicknames Many RFC/RAF aircraft of this period received nicknames (some of which, like the \\"zoo\\" names of Sopwith types, reached semi-official status), and the DH.6 has a variety of humorous but disrespectful epithets. The reactions of novice pilots were probably behind it being called the \\"clutching hand\\". Australian airmen may have been referring to its lack of speed when calling it \\"skyhook\\", although the shape of the exhaust pipes has also been mentioned. Other nicknames for the type included \\"crab,\\" \\"clockwork mouse,\\" \\"flying coffin\\" and \\"dung hunter\\" (these last two on account of the shape of the plywood cockpit, thought to resemble either a coffin or an outside toilet).Australian War Museum website Postwar and civil use There was no place for the DH.6 in the postwar RAF, and survivors were sold off as surplus. In 1919, many went to civilian operators ‚Äì especially for \\"joy riding\\". Some were exported to South Africa and the Point Cook-based aircraft were sold in Australia, where they continued flying into the late 1930s. Some 60 aircraft were licence-built in Spain from 1921 onwards with Hispano-Suiza 8 engines, refined fuselages that included separate cockpits, and rounded \\"de Havilland style\\" rudder/fin assemblies. At least some of these found their way into the inventory of two Spanish Air Force training establishments.Jackson 1987, p. 89.

Common names include black wattle, hickory wattle, mangium, and forest mangrove. Its uses include environmental management and wood. It was first described in 1806 by Carl Ludwig Willdenow, who described it as living in the Moluccas.  Cultivation  Acacia mangium grows up to , often with a straight trunk. A. mangium has about 142,000 seeds/kg. To break down dormancy mature seed requires pre-germination treatments such as mechanical scarification (scratching the surface) or boiling water. This treatment leads to a fast germination and typically exceeds 75%. Like many other legumes, it is able to fix nitrogen in the soil. A. mangium is a popular species for forest plantation and used more and more also for agroforestry projects. In mixed cultures, plants can profit of the shadow from A. mangium and the nitrogen fixation A. mangium will tolerate low fertility soils with impeded drainage, but prefers fertile sites with good drainage. Soil depth and topographic position can influence yields. With respect to distance from the equator, there are significant differences in performance under cultivation. A mean annual height increase of about 3 to 4 m is usual near the equator. In areas further from the equator growth is slower.  Uses = Timber  Acacia mangium trees produce sapwood and heartwood. The heartwood's colour is brownish yellow shimmery and medium textured. Because the timber is extremely heavy, hard, very strong, tough, and not liable to warp and crack badly it is used for furniture, doors and window frames. The glossy and smooth surface finish after polishing leads also to a potential for making export-oriented parquet flooring tiles and artifacts.  Soil management and ecological restoration  Because Acacia mangium trees increase the turnover rate of nitrogen in the topsoil, it can improve the nitrogen availability in soils in mixed cultures.^Voigtlaender M. et al. (2012). Introducing Acacia mangium trees in Eucalyptus grandis plantations: consequences for soil organic matter stocks and nitrogen mineralization. Plant and Soil 352(1‚Äì2):99‚Äì111 Due to the fact that it is a very fast growing tree it develops an intensive rooting system, particularly in low fertility soils.Kadir W.R, Kadir A.A., Van Cleemput O., Zaharah Abdul Rahman. 1996. Field grown Acacia mangium: How intensive is root growth? Journal of Tropical Forest Science 10(3): 283‚Äì291 (1998) This helps to recover degraded tropical lands The tree is widely used in Goa, India in the mining industry for rehabilitation of waste dumps as it is a drought-resistant species and binds sterile mine waste consisting of lateritic strata. In Colombia, it has been used for restoring wasteland created by open-pit gold mining. Chemistry The gum contains 5.4% ash, 0.98% N, 1.49% methoxyl, and by calculation, 32.2% uronic acid.

History Atzat Nefesh was founded in 2001 by Rabbi Shlomo Aviner. Specifically, it addresses people who are dealing with homosexuality, masturbation; pornography, or prostitution; or have been victims of sexual abuse. Atzat Nefesh operates support groups and a hotline staffed by volunteers with a yeshiva background.Lichtman, Gail. (November 25, 2005) The Jerusalem Post Nature or nurture? Section: Features; Page 18. The organization believes that with the proper treatment it is possible to change sexual behavior and sexual orientation. Atzat Nefesh upholds the view that by strengthening the masculinity of homosexuals, they will discover their hidden, inborn heterosexuality. To that purpose it organizes three day long workshops, called \\"Journey to masculinity\\". The organization directs its applicants to therapists who use conversion therapy methods. Controversy The Israel Ministry of Health in October 2014 adopted the position paper of the Israel Psychological Association which prohibits the use of conversion therapy, as advocated by Atzat Nefesh, and warned the public about such treatments.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4578145,00.html In March 2015, Israeli blogger and gay rights advocate Natan Azulay went undercover to receive ‚Äúconversion therapy‚Äù from Atzat Nefesh, and then published a report on the Israeli website Mako.http://www.mako.co.il/pride- news/local/Article-8a0065af7415c41006.htm Azulay‚Äôs report indicates that Atzat Nefesh continues to refer people to uncredentialed ‚Äútherapists‚Äù whose training is questionable and who are not considered mental health professionals.
