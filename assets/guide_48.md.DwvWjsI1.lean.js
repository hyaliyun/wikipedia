Its mission is to collect sound recordings related to the history and culture of Switzerland, to make them accessible and to make them available for use. In terms of audio recordings, it thus fulfils a similar function to the Swiss National Library in the field of literature. Since 2016, the National Sound Archives have been an organisational part of the Swiss National Library. The collection has more than 500,000 audio carriers and 20-25,000 audio documents are added each year (as of 2018). The institution is a member of the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) and the Audio Engineering Society (AES). The Swiss National Sound Archives is also a member of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) and the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres (IAML).  History  There were 15 years between the idea of a Swiss sound archives and the actual foundation. As early as 1972, Robert Wyler, who was responsible for special collections in the Swiss National Library, suggested that a sound archives should be set up for Switzerland. Hans-Rudolf D√ºrrenmatt, head of the music department at the Central Library in Solothurn, also called for a sound archives in 1976. The two also held this position in the Phonotheque Commission of the Association of Swiss Librarians and the Swiss Association for Documentation. The 1975 Clottu Report (official title: \\"El√©ments pour une politique culturelle suisse\\"), named after National Councillor Gaston Clottu, recommended the realisation of a phonotek. In 1980, a working group of the Federal Office of Culture presented a report on the planned Swiss National Sound Archives, which also contained a draft of a deed of foundation. However, an application to the Federal Council from the Federal Department of Home Affairs to this effect was withdrawn due to financial hurdles. In 1982, the Federal Council approved start-up financing of CHF 120,000. The city of Lugano made the former radio studio of the city available for the project free of charge. In 1984, the \\"Swiss National Sound Archives Establishment Association\\" was founded, whose task was to set up the sound archives with the aim of transferring them to the Swiss National Library at a later date. In addition to the start-up funding provided by the Confederation, the Swiss Cooperative of Authors and Publishers of Music (SUISA) contributed 100,000 Swiss francs and the City of Lugano 163,000 Swiss francs for the conversion of the radio studio, which was completed in 1985. In 1987 the association was transformed into a foundation under private law. In addition to the canton of Ticino and the city of Lugano, the Swiss Radio and Television Society (SRG) and the collecting societies SUISA, SIG and IFPI also participated in the foundation. Since 1998 Pio Pellizzari has been director of the institution, which in 2007 was renamed from the National Sound Archives to the National Sound Archives.Theo M√§usli: Schweizerische Landesphonothek / Schweizerische Nationalphonothek in German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland, 2019-07-15. In 2001, the Swiss National Sound Archives moved to the Centro San Carlo. With the integration into the Federal Administration, which the Federal Council decided on 28 November 2014 with the adoption of the Cultural Message 2016-2020, the Foundation was dissolved with effect from 1 January 2016. In addition to the federal subsidy of CHF 1.6 million, the sound archives have received operating contributions from the Canton of Ticino (CHF 290,000) and the City of Lugano (CHF 170,000). This support will be continued. The sound archive is now integrated into the Federal Office of Culture as the \\"Swiss National Sound Archives Section\\" of the Swiss National Library.  Collections  The National Sound Archives collects sound recordings with * Works by Swiss composers and authors * Recordings by Swiss performers * Works published by Swiss companies The National Sound Archives began its collecting activities in 1986, but thanks to the acquisition of various existing collections and estates, numerous sound recordings from earlier times are also available.

Family Louis Hyppolite de Lormel was born on 19 October 1808 in Lesina, Dalmatia (now Hvar in Croatia), where his father was a surgeon in the French army of occupation. He was baptized on 26 October 1808. His parents were Alexandre Louis Delormel (ca 1784‚Äì1861) and Elisabeth Angelinin (died 1835). His sister was Laure Ad√®le Delormel (1816‚Äì1877). On 21 December 1844, he married Narcisse Jos√©phine Laurent (died 1872) in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, Paris. They had a child Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Louis de Lormel (1847‚Äì1910). Career De Lormel studied law and became a notary. He rose through the ranks of the notarial profession, becoming Clerk Grade 1 around 1930. In 1933 he was living at 36 rue du Cadran in Paris. He served in Algeria from 1841 to 1858. He became a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1851, and later became an Officer and Commander of the Legion of Honour. He was given an honorable mention by the Minister of War for his fight against a cholera epidemic in Algeria. He was stationed in Paris from 1858 to 1859. Guadeloupe On 4 February 1861, Lormel was appointed Director of the Interior of Guadeloupe. On 11 January 1862, Lormel became interim governor in place of General Charles Victor Fr√©bault. Fr√©bault resumed office as governor on 4 July 1862. On 26 February 1864, Joseph Desmazes became interim governor. Lormel became governor on 19 May 1864. His son, Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Louis Lormel (1847-1910), an army lieutenant, served as his aide-de-camp in 1874-1875. Lormel issued a decree of 18 June 1864 that removed the need for residents to buy and carry an internal passport at all times, subject to a year's labor if found without it, a law that in practice was only enforced for non-whites. Lormel sent an Expos√© g√©n√©ral sur la situation de la Guadeloupe dated 26 September 1865 to the Ministry of the Navy, a useful source of information on the sugar industry. In September 1865, the island was hit by a violent hurricane, and this was followed by an epidemic of Asian cholera that continued until April 1866. In 1867, the colony had 151,744 inhabitants. It had a railroad long. Lormel appointed the convinced Bonapartist Fr√©d√©ric Alfred Eggiman as Director of the Interior. Eggiman did not resign until 1873, when it became certain that France would remain a republic. On 7 December 1868, Desmazes again became interim governor of Guadeloupe, holding office until Gabriel Couturier assumed the post of governor on 24 April 1870. R√©union 150px On 31 August 1869, Lormel was appointed Governor of R√©union in place of Rear-Admiral Marie Jules Dupr√©. Louis Hippolyte de Lormel arrived in R√©union on 27 September 1869 to take over from Laborde, the commissaire ordonateur, who had acted as governor since the departure of Rear-Admiral Dupr√©. He was the first civilian governor on the island. His inauguration on 2 December 1869 was on the first anniversary of the tragic events in Saint Denis, but he avoided serious trouble. Many of the settlers in Reunion were dissatisfied by the imperial administration's financial management. A telegram of 20 July 1870 arrived on 5 August 1870 and told of the outbreak of war between France and Prussia. News of the fall of the Second French Empire began to trickle into the colony from the start of October 1870. On 2 November 1870, the passenger ship Emirne arrived in the bay of Saint-Denis and the news was official. On 3 November 1870, Lormel proclaimed the French Third Republic from the platform decorated with tricolor flags in the Place du Gouvernement. The proclamation was made to a huge crowd, in the presence of leading military and civilian authorities. On 9 February 1871, a decree was published that allowed a 13 February 1871 election by universal suffrage for the 24 members of the General Council, which first met on 8 March 1871. News of the peace with Prussia arrived on 15 March 1871. Lormel's wife died in Saint Denis on 13 April 1872, and from 21 September to 22 November 1873, Lormel was given leave from his duties. His main achievement while in office was to develop primary education. He created a permanent health services at the end of his term due to the frequent outbreaks of epidemics. Last years Lormel left office at his request on 18 September 1875 and handed over to Laborde as interim governor. Lormel died in Paris on 31 March 1888, and is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, 14th division. The epitaph on his grave reads \\"Esprit √©lev√© et lib√©ral. Il a servi la France et aim√© sa famille avec passion.\\" (With a high and liberal spirit, he served France and loved his family with passion).

Overview  The immune system has the ability to differentiate between the body's own cells and foreign cells. However, in the dogs affected by auto-immune disease, the immune system loses the ability to distinguish between body's own cells and foreign cells, causing their immune system to attack the body's own cells.Auto-immune Diseases Autoimmune diseases in the base layer of the epidermis are characterized by damage to the connective tissue and vesicle formation located below the epidermis layer and the dermis layer below it.Papadogiannakis EI. 2005. Contemporary aspects of the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases of the epidermal basement membrane in the dog. The Journal of the Hellenic Veterinary Medical Society 56(1) p 27-31.  Clinical symptoms  Pemphigus foliaceus in dogs: hair loss occurs, skin becomes red, and itchy. Dogs suffering from autoimmune diseases of the skin may experience a variety of symptoms, including persistent itching and scratching, lesions, wounds, blisters, and other skin damage, as well as loss of skin pigment. Two cases of autoimmune diseases that are often found include Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and Pemphigus. DLE can develop into Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The initial stage of DLE is marked by a loss of skin pigment. The skin becomes red and sores appear on the nose. The palate can undergo erosion, ulceration, and injury to the nasal palate, as well as damage to the nostrils and the tissue around the eyes and ears. In chronic and severe cases, visual scar tissue often occurs.Immune-mediated Skin Diseases. Rimini: 50th Congresso Nazionale Multisala SCIVAC In infections caused by Pemphigus vulgaris, lesions are usually evident in the oral cavity. Sometimes symptoms are characterized by lymphadenopathy, which is characterized by loss of appetite, weakness, fever, and in rare cases, sepsis. Pemphigus foliaceus usually affects areas of the ears and face. Early symptoms are characterized by depigmentation of the nasal palate, dorsal cleft in the mouth, the ear, and the periocular area around the eye. Itching, pain, and weakness of the body have been observed in some cases.  Disease incidence process  There are two mechanisms of tolerance found in the immune system. The first mechanism is positive selection by the thymus, where only T cells are selected. T cells recognize peptides in the Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The second mechanism is negative selection, where T cells that recognize self-antigens with too high an affinity are removed through the process of apoptosis and are not allowed to enter the body's circulation.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies in Japan when she won her first two races including the Ivy Stakes and then ran a close second in the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. In the following year she won the Daily Hai Queen Cup and then contested all three legs of the Japanese Fillies' Triple Crown, finishing third in both the Oka Sho and the Yushun Himba before winning the Shuka Sho. Background Chrono Genesis is a grey filly with a white star bred in Hokkaido by Northern Farm. She was sent into training with Takashi Saito at Ritt≈ç, Shiga and carries the red, black and yellow colours of Sunday Racing. She was ridden in most of her races by Yuichi Kitamura. She was from the tenth crop of foals sired by Bago, an outstanding middle-distance runner in Europe whose biggest win came in the included the 2004 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a breeding stallion in Japan he started well but became disappointing: Chrono Genesis was his first Grade 1 winner since Big Week won the Kikuka Sho in 2010. Chrono Genesis's dam Chronologist, from whom she inherited her grey colour, showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race as a three-year- old in 2006. As a broodmare she also produced the Victoria Mile winner Normcore. She was descended from the American broodmare Nimble Doll (foaled 1952), making her a distant relative of Captain Steve. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= Chrono Genesis began her racing career by winning an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1800 metres at Kokura Racecourse on 2 September. On 20 October she was stepped up in class for the Listed Ivy Stakes over the same distance at Tokyo Racecourse when she was the only filly in a ten-runner field and won by two lengths from Cosmo Calendula. Saito later commented \\"She waited patiently and went all out in the final stages and displayed the kind of kick we thought she would from her morning work\\". On 9 December the filly was moved up to the highest level for the Grade 1 Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse and started the 2.6/1 second favourite in an eighteen-runner field. After starting slowly she was towards the rear for most of the race before making rapid progress in the straight and finishing second to the favoured Danon Fantasy, beaten half a length by the winner. In the official ratings for Japanese two-year-olds Chrono Genesis was rated the second best juvenile filly of the year, one pound behind Danon Fantasy and six pounds below the top-rated colt Admire Mars. =2019: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Chrono Genesis started 1.1/1 favourite for the Grade 2 Daily High Queen Cup (a trial for the Oka Sho) over 1800 metres at Toyo on 11 February. She came from sixth place on the final turn to win by a neck and half a length from Beach Samba and Jodie. In the Oka Sho over 1600 metres at Hanshin on 7 April the filly started the 4.7/1 third choice in the betting behind Danon Fantasy and Gran Alegria. After racing in mid-division Chrono Genesis was switched to the outside and produced a \\"powerful turn of speed\\" to take third place behind Gran Alegria and Shigeru Pink Dia. On 19 May at Tokyo Chrono Genesis was moved up in distance and made the second favourite behind Loves Only You for the 2400 metre Yushun Himba. She raced just behind the leaders for most of the way before keeping on well in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished third behind Loves Only You and the 93.1/1 outsider Curren Bouquetd'Or. After a break of almost five months Chrono Genesis returned for the Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 13 October and started the 5.9/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Danon Fantasy, Curren Bouquetd'Or and Espoir. The other thirteen runners included Beach Samba, Shigeru Pink Dia, Contra Check (Flower Cup), Passing Through (Shion Stakes) and Schon Glanz (Artemis Stakes). Chrono Genesis settled behind the leaders as Danon Fantasy set the pace before being switched to the outside in the straight and launching a sustained run. She took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Curren Bouquetd'Or with a further length and half back to Shigeru Pink Dia in third. After the race Yuichi Kitamura said \\"I was able to race her in an ideal position... I was able to make bid with confidence. I am grateful for having been able to ride the filly since her debut, I'm really glad that I was able to deliver a good result\\". Four weeks later the filly contested the Grade 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup when she was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time and started the 2.5/1 second favourite. She was settled just behind the leaders for most of the way but was unable to make any significant progress in the straight and came home fifth of the eighteen runners, two lengths behind the winner Lucky Lilac. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Chrono Genesis finished third behind Gran Alegria and Loves Only You in the poll to determine the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly, taking 47 of the 274 votes. =2020: four-year-old season= Pedigree *Chrono Genesis is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

He managed public tennis facilities in New Orleans and played competitive tennis into old age. He was particularly noted for teaching young African-Americans, especially the underprivileged, to play the sport of tennis. Early life and education Atkinson was born in 1918 in Biloxi, Mississippi, to parents C.C. Atkinson and Josephine Atkinson. He was the first of ten children in the family. Atkinson's family moved to New Orleans just before the Great Depression as his father became bishop of the Christ Holiness Church there. Atkinson attended New Orleans Public Schools, including two years of high school. He began playing tennis at age nine, learning without the benefit of professional instruction, being attracted to the sport despite its dominance by white people. During World War II, Atkinson served in the United States Army's Black Corps of Engineers, which was responsible for building airstrips in Washington state, Alaska, and various locations in the south Pacific Ocean. Atkinson's role was as a medical corpsman for the 97th Engineer Regiment. He returned to New Orleans after his tour of military duty in December 1945. At that time, he studied offset printing at the Louisiana Industrial Training School in Farmerville, Louisiana. Atkinson subsequently returned to New Orleans, where he obtained employment with the Dryades Street branch of the YMCA. Here he organized various activities, especially for young people. He established and taught tennis clinics for young people. During this time, he gained the attention of the local Coca-Cola Bottling Company which was a sponsor of the Dryades Street YMCA and gave Atkinson employment as a night supervisor. Tennis career Atkinson - Stern Tennis Center in New Orleans In 1947, as part of his experience with the Dryades Street YMCA, Atkinson co-founded the New Orleans Hard Court Tennis Club, which provided opportunities for African-Americans to play competitive tennis in the segregated society of the time. This included organizing tennis tournaments, often taking place at Xavier University, a historically black university. In his early years of teaching tennis, due to limited resources, Atkinson sometimes used parking lots with a modified volleyball net instead of a tennis net as makeshift tennis courts. He taught youngsters the sport of tennis regardless of their ethnic background. Atkinson participated in many tournaments sponsored by the American Tennis Association, and he also supported them by doing volunteer work on behalf of the association. This was before the time that the United States Tennis Association accepted African- American players, while the American Tennis Association promoted African- American participation in the sport. As a player, Atkinson won various regional tennis tournaments throughout the southern United States, winning approximately 15 tournament titles. Following the 1974 relocation of the New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club, the former location became the Stern Tennis Center, a part of the New Orleans Recreation Department. This facility, on South Saratoga Street in New Orleans, welcomed African-Americans to play tennis. Atkinson became the manager of the facility, a position he held until his retirement in 1995. At the time of his retirement, Lloyd Dillon became manager of the facility, whom Atkinson has mentored for the position. Atkinson's notable tennis students included Chanda Rubin and Sharon Pettis, who later became the tennis coach at Marquette University. He also helped Pettis obtain a scholarship from the Southern University men's tennis team, an indication that he broke boundaries in both race and gender relations. Pettis later worked as a tennis instructor for the New Orleans Recreation Department as did Atkinson. Atkinson wrote a column for the Louisiana Weekly newspaper, with a readership of mostly African-American tennis players, entitled \\"Hard Court Tennis Notes\\". =Experience with segregation= Much of Atkinson's career coincided with the era of the Jim Crow South, and he frequently was taunted at integrated tennis tournaments in which he participated. He had urine-filled tennis balls and other objects thrown at him. He received inappropriate foot- fault calls and sometimes was verbally abused by tournament officials. After segregation in the Deep South subsided, Atkinson became a member of the New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club, from which he had previously been excluded for racial reasons. This was the most prestigious tennis facility in New Orleans at the time. As of 2019, the New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club was also the oldest tennis club in the United States (founded in 1876), and it had become racially integrated only in 1986. In the 1960s, local tennis player Harry Anisgard sponsored Atkinson for membership in the formerly all-white New Orleans City Park Tennis Club. In reprisal, Anisgard was dismissed from the club. The club had regrets soon afterward, and re-admitted Anisgard to the club, ironically with Atkinson's sponsorship. =Senior tennis= As a senior tennis player, Atkinson won the Men‚Äôs 65 Singles Championships in both 1989 and 1990 sponsored by the United States Professional Tennis Registry. He subsequently won the Men‚Äôs 70+ Singles in 1994 through 1997 and then again in 2000 and 2001. In 1993, Atkinson was named Player of the Year for the United States Professional Tennis Registry. In 1999, Atkinson won the 80s National Hard Court Championship in San Diego, California, and, with a doubles partner, the World International Senior Tennis Championship in Barcelona, Spain. In 2001, he won the World Men's 80s Grasscourt Championship, held in Perth, Australia. With regard to his success in senior competitive tennis, Atkinson stated: Later life Atkinson died of cancer at the Kenner Regional Medical Center in 2003 and was then interred at the Biloxi National Cemetery. Honors and recognition The Atkinson-Stern Tennis Center of the New Orleans Recreation Department, located in uptown New Orleans, is named in honor of Atkinson and philanthropist Edgar B. Stern. Atkinson served as a pallbearer at the funeral of tennis star Arthur Ashe. In 1977, Atkinson received the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Ripple of Hope Award. He was the first African-American to be inducted into the Southern Tennis Hall of Fame. In 2000, Atkinson was inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. The Louisiana Tennis Association awards the Nehemiah Atkinson Diversity and Inclusion Champion Award in Atkinson's honor. The Professional Tennis Registry Foundation awards the Nehemiah Atkinson Humanitarian Grant, given to an individual distinguished by actions aimed at improving the lives of others. As a senior tennis player, he received the T.N. Touchstone, Jr. Memorial Trophy, awarded for his sportsmanship and support of southern tennis.

The operation took place in the outskirts of Barisha, Idlib Governorate, Syria. According to General Kenneth \\"Frank\\" McKenzie, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) commander who oversaw the operation, Baghdadi killed himself along with two children when he detonated a suicide belt while seeking to evade the U.S. forces during the raid. Background The raid was launched based on an intelligence effort to locate the leader of ISIL by the CIA's Special Activities Center. The New York Times reported that, according to two U.S. officials, the CIA obtained the original intelligence on Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi following the arrests of one of his wives and a courier, after which the CIA worked closely with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria. The Guardian, however, reported Iraqi officials as saying that the break came after a smuggler (who had smuggled the wives of two brothers of Baghdadi and Baghdadi's children in the past), a woman thought to be his wife, and Baghdadi's nephew provided information on the routes and destinations. Iraqi officials also stated that the arrest of Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie, Baghdadi's brother-in-law, helped them in finding a desert tunnel leading to two hideouts, filled with items, near Al-Qaim, Iraq, and thereby penetrate a smuggling ring to find Baghdadi. A U.S. official disputed the Iraqi account that Iraq had provided the exact location of Baghdadi, and stated that the operation was triggered when he appeared in a location where they already had established intelligence collection. =Location= Reuters reported Iraqi intelligence officials as stating that the arrest of several Islamic State leaders was the key behind learning about Baghdadi's movements and hiding places. They said that Ismael al-Ethawi, believed to be a top aide to Baghdadi, was found and followed by informants in Syria, apprehended by Turkish authorities, and handed over to Iraqi intelligence agents to whom he provided information in February 2018. The Iraqis then gave the information to the CIA, who kept surveillance on the discovered location through a satellite and drones. They also said that in 2019 the United States, Turkish and Iraqi intelligence conducted a joint operation in which they captured several high- ranking ISIL leaders, including four Iraqis and a Syrian, who provided the locations where they met with Baghdadi inside Syria, after which they decided to coordinate with the CIA to deploy more sources inside these areas. One of the Iraqi officials remarked that \\"his last moment to live\\" was when Baghdadi and his family left the location that he was in for the first time. Ethawi and the other aides in an interview to The New York Times stated that they were blindfolded before being taken to meet their leader, in order to keep his whereabouts secret, they were then kept at the location for hours before being blindfolded again and driven away from the site. Baghdadi's compound was located near GPS coordinates 36.1660, 36.6274, in Syria's Idlib Governorate. Although Idlib is dominated by the Islamic State's rival jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has connections to al-Qaeda, the Institute for the Study of War warned that Idlib is nevertheless the focus of an ISIL strategy to have it serve as an incubator for the next iteration of ISIL and al-Qaeda recruits. In July 2019, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford explained that there were around 20,000-30,000 fighters in Idlib by that time in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, which started in 2011. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Michael P. Mulroy said that \\"Idlib is essentially the largest collection of al-Qaeda affiliates in the world.\\" In regards to Baghdadi's possible rationale for choosing the location, \\"We assess that he was hiding in Idlib province to avoid the intense pressure that had been put on ISIS in other areas of Syria,\\" operational commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie later stated. Documents later obtained by Al Aan TV's Jenan Moussa reportedly revealed that, from 1 February 2019 until the day of the U.S. raid, Baghdadi's compound had internet access and that the owner of the site paid the equivalent of an $8 monthly fee in cash to the regional ISP for service. According to Moussa, the username Baghdadi used was \\"mhrab.\\" =Kurdish role= The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reported that they provided direct and extensive support to the operation. Prior to the raid, the SDF, working with the U.S. government, had spent five months gathering intelligence on Baghdadi's location. A senior U.S. State Department official said that the Kurdish-led SDF \\"played a key role\\" in the raid on Baghdadi's compound and that the United States was in close communication with SDF commander Gen. Mazloum Abdi about every aspect of their operation, and Abdi's statements about the raid, in reference to the joint intelligence cooperation on the ground, were accurate. Gen. Mazloum Abdi said the operation had been delayed by a month due to Turkey's military build-up at the Syrian border and the Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria that followed. The New York Times reported that unnamed U.S. intelligence, military, and counter-terrorism officials said that the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria by President Donald Trump had complicated the plans for the operation against Baghdadi, but the Syrian Kurds continued to provide information to the CIA amidst the Turkish offensive. One of the officials remarked that both the Syrian and Iraqi Kurds had provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country. CENTCOM commander Frank McKenzie later confirmed the SDF had provided intelligence to American forces prior to the raid in Idlib, but denied reports that the president's prior order to withdraw forces from north Syria had any impact on the timing or execution of the mission. Embedded informant The Washington Post reported that, according to a U.S. official, an ISIL militant-turned informant for the Kurds had provided critical intelligence about Baghdadi's location. The SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said that their informant was deep inside Baghdadi's inner circle as a security adviser and had provided a detailed layout of the complex, and was on-site during the operation, after which he left with the U.S. forces. SDF officials said that the informant had stolen Baghdadi's underwear and a sample of Baghdadi's blood, which was provided to the U.S. intelligence for DNA analysis and resulted in a positive match. U.S. and Middle East‚Äìbased officials stated that the informant was a Sunni Arab ISIL operative, who served as a trusted facilitator and logistics aide to Baghdadi, but defected because ISIL killed his relative, after which he was cultivated as an intelligence asset by the SDF. They said that, after the SDF leadership handed control over the informant to the U.S. intelligence, the informant was carefully vetted for several weeks by the U.S. intelligence and that the effort to exploit the intelligence asset began in the summer of 2019. The informant was subsequently extracted from the region with his family two days after the raid and will likely receive at least some of the $25 million bounty. Prelude Two U.S. officials stated that Baghdadi had been staying at the compound in Barisha since July 2019 and that it had been under surveillance since, but U.S. forces avoided assaulting it due to the presence of al-Qaeda affiliates and the airspace being controlled by Russia and the Syrian government. Some U.S. officials claimed that the Pentagon decided to carry out the mission after President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria in early October, as to not lose track of Baghdadi. However, CENTCOM commander Frank McKenzie has stated that the north Syria pullout had \\"absolutely\\" no effect on the timing or execution of the operation. \\"We chose the time based on a variety of factors: weather, certainty, lunar data ... We struck because the time was about right to do it then given the totality of the intelligence and the other factors that would affect the raid force going in and coming out,\\" General McKenzie added. The Turkish Defense Ministry said that Turkish and U.S. military authorities exchanged and coordinated information ahead of the attack in Idlib. A U.S. official stated that Turkey was informed prior to the operation to avoid an unintended clash between their forces, but was not notified about the target due to concerns that the information would become compromised and did not provide any assistance to the operation. Turkish officials also informed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which controls much of the area where the raid took place, not to open fire on the helicopters that would be used in the operation; despite being informed, anti- aircraft fire by HTS was used, however, the operators were detained by HTS commanders afterward for not following orders.https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-hunt-for-islamic-state- leader-baghdadi-a-1294485-amp.html General McKenzie briefed Defense Department leaders on the intelligence and the plan on October 25 and received the approval of Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley for the operation. President Trump was then briefed \\"on all aspects of the plan and the risks involved in its execution\\" and that Russia and Turkey were contacted ahead of the mission to avoid unintended clashes. With Trump's approval, McKenzie, as operational commander, gave the order for the mission to start October 26 around 9 a.m. EST. Raid Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Chairman Mark Milley, and Brigadier general Marcus Evans observe the operation in the White House Situation Room, October 26, 2019 On October 26, 2019, shortly after U.S. president Donald Trump and a small team of key civilian and military leaders gathered in the White House Situation Room at around 5 p.m. EST (23:00 Syria time), U.S. Joint Special Operations Command's 1st SFOD-D (Delta Force) operators, along with U.S. Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, departed Al Asad Airbase in Iraq in eight U.S. military helicopters, including Boeing MH-47 Chinooks and Sikorsky MH-60L/M Blackhawks, to conduct an air assault raid on an \\"isolated compound\\" 300 meters outside Barisha village‚Äîlocated five kilometers (three miles) south of the border with Turkey in hostile rebel-held territory in Idlib Governorate of Syria‚Äîto kill or capture Baghdadi; the assault force reportedly flew through Turkish- controlled and Russian-monitored airspace towards the objective and landed after 70 minutes. According to General McKenzie, who oversaw the operation, air cover for the assault included armed helicopters, multiple drones, and fighter aircraft providing close air support; they planned for multiple children/non-militants at the compound and tried to minimize casualties. As the heli-borne assault force approached Baghdadi's compound, the helicopters reportedly came under gunfire from two locations from non-ISIL militant groups that were outside the target building but in the area of operations; according to McKenzie, they were neutralized with two airstrikes from supporting helicopters. The Delta Force operators, supported by military working dogs and military robots, landed outside the compound and surrounded it, repeatedly calling on its occupants to come out peacefully in Arabic. \\"Those who came out of the building were checked for weapons and explosives and moved away,\\" McKenzie said. \\"U.S. forces detained and later released the noncombatants. The group was treated humanely at all times, and included 11 children.\\" Five ISIL members inside the compound‚Äîfour women and one man‚Äî\\"presented a threat to the force\\" and were killed when they did not respond to commands to surrender, as they were suspected of wearing suicide vests. Believing the main entrance to be booby trapped, operators breached the compound's walls with explosives. U.S. special operations personnel advance on the target building UCAV bombards Baghdadi's compound following extraction of U.S. forces Once Delta was inside the target building, Baghdadi fled into a tunnel network under the premises wearing a suicide vest and carrying two children with him; by the time he reached a dead end, an explosive ordinance disposal military robot and a dog (later identified as a male Belgian Malinois named \\"Conan\\") had been dispatched to subdue him. He detonated his vest, killing himself and two children, and causing the tunnel to collapse. The children killed were believed to be younger than 12 years old. U.S. soldiers dug through the debris to retrieve some of Baghdadi's remains and lab technicians successfully conducted DNA profiling and biometrics tests within 15 minutes of his death via Defense Intelligence Agency analysis, confirming Baghdadi's identity. According to the White House, \\"a combination of visual evidence and DNA tests confirmed Baghdadi‚Äôs identity.\\" The quick DNA confirmation is attributed to special forces already possessing samples of Baghdadi's tissue, reportedly voluntarily provided by one of his daughters, according to a U.S. official. McKenzie, however, stated that they were obtained from his time in Camp Bucca. Two adult male captives and a \\"substantial\\" amount of documents and electronic items were seized from the compound during the raid which, per U.S. officials, was a primary goal so they could understand the current leadership structure of ISIL. Items included 5-6 cellphones, 2-4 laptops and some USB flash drives. Just before 3:30 am Syrian time, U.S. choppers departed the area for Iraq and the compound was then destroyed by airstrikes from overhead F-15 jets and MQ-9 Reaper drones, reportedly to prevent the site from becoming a \\"shrine\\" for sympathizers. According to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, a wide variety of munitions, including AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles, unspecified precision-guided bombs, and AGM-114 Hellfire guided missiles were responsible for leveling Baghdadi's compound. McKenzie, who called the operation \\"exquisitely planned and executed,\\" stated that the special forces who took part in the operation were based in Syria and that only U.S. personnel were involved in the raid on the compound itself. The entire operation lasted roughly two hours. Aftermath General McKenzie called in and announced the mission's success to President Donald Trump's team in the White House Situation Room, saying \\"Got him, 100 percent confidence, jackpot, over,\\" according to National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. =Trump press conference= White House Diplomatic Reception Room on October 27, 2019 At 9:23 p.m. EST, President Trump tweeted \\"Something very big has just happened!\\" with the White House subsequently announcing a planned press conference at 9 a.m. the next morning. At the presser, fourteen hours after the raid, Trump announced Baghdadi's death and went on to describe the successful operation against him in detail, reporting that U.S. forces used helicopters, jets, and drones through airspace controlled by Russia and Turkey. He also said that they had Baghdadi \\"under surveillance for 'a couple of weeks' and 'two or three' raids had been canceled because of his movements\\". He continued: \\"The forces targeted the compound using eight helicopters, which were met with hostile fire. The commandos entered the building by blowing holes in the wall, avoiding the main door which was booby-trapped.\\" Trump announced that Baghdadi died by detonating a suicide vest after he was chased by U.S. military dogs and was cornered inside a tunnel. He and other officials initially stated that the explosion killed three of his children alongside him, however General Frank McKenzie later said it had been confirmed only two were killed. Trump said Baghdadi died \\"like a dog and a coward\\" and \\"whimpering and crying and screaming\\", but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and various Pentagon and administration officials either could not confirm, or outright denied, the \\"whimpering and crying\\" detail as Trump reportedly had only seen drone surveillance without live audio. Reportedly, some U.S. officials said that Trump's press conference contained several pieces of information that were inaccurate, highly classified, or tactically sensitive. =Casualties= Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley said during a Pentagon briefing that Baghdadi's corpse disposal \\"was handled appropriately\\", initially adding that Washington had no plans to release images of his death, but later showed footage of the raid during a briefing on October 30. Baghdadi was buried at sea and afforded Islamic rites, three anonymous U.S. officials told Reuters and a Pentagon source told AFP. An aide of Baghdadi, who handled logistics, was the other man killed according to Iraqi officials. United States secretary of state Mike Pompeo said that two wives of al-Baghdadi were also killed in the raid. Conan, the American Special Operations Military Working Dog that chased after Baghdadi Trump said no U.S. soldiers were injured, but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said two had been lightly injured during the raid. An American Special Operations Military Working Dog (SOMWD), a male Belgian Malinois named Conan, who chased Baghdadi, was treated for his injuries and returned to work on October 28. During a news conference that day, Esper and Milley declined to identify him for security reasons; Trump released a declassified photograph of him later in the day. The dog was injured due to live electrical cables that were exposed, according to McKenzie. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) war monitor, Delta Force killed nine people, including one child, two women and some high-ranking ISIL leaders. Baghdadi's suicide vest killed two more children, reportedly his own. The Americans captured two militants and rescued eleven children. General Frank McKenzie said six ISIL members, which included four women and another man asides from Baghdadi, were killed in the operation. The raid also killed about 10 to 15 members of other groups who engaged American forces. Delta also killed a local Guardians of Religion Organization commander, identified as Abu Muhammad al-Halabi, the owner of the house Baghdadi was staying at. An Iraqi intelligence official and Hisham al-Hashimi have stated to The Independent that Halabi was also a smuggler, which is why the ISIL head and his family utilized his services. The inhabitants of the village stated that he was a sheep seller, but rarely interacted with his neighbors. His other alias is believed to be Abu Mohammed Salama and his corpse was flown away by Delta Force after the raid according to Barisha's inhabitants. He, along with some other Hurras al-Din, members is also suspected to have been part of a pro-ISIL faction. Based on a receipt book of ISIL found by associates of former American intelligence official Asaad Almohammad, analysts have stated that Baghdadi was paying the members of the group in exchange for hiding him. According to the receipt book, ISIL paid at least $67,000 to them from early 2017 to mid-2018, including $7,000 in summer 2018 to prepare bases for ISIL fighters from \\"al-Khair province\\", hinting that they helped in smuggling ISIL members. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi pointed to the fact that the two groups were enemies, citing a warning by Hurras al-Din to its members in February 2019 to avoid contact with ISIL and the latter issuing the similar statement about the former in July. However, Tamimi also said that some of the receipts might be fabrications, except the ones from March to July 2018 that he was shown. Possible civilian casualties U.S. helicopters engage hostile targets in support of ground forces near Baghdadi's compound, October 26, 2019. Excluding the two children killed due to Baghdadi's suicide, the U.S. military said there were no civilian casualties during the operation. Besides the two children killed by Baghdadi's suicide detonation, the U.S. military reported no civilian casualties during the operation. A report by NPR released on December 3, 2019, cited a local farmer, Barakat Ahmad Barakat, as saying that his right hand and forearm were blown off and his two friends were killed by U.S. helicopter fire during the operation. According to Barakat's account, Khaled Mustafa Qurmo and Khaled Abdel Majid Qurmo, two cousins, were driving him home in Barisha on October 26 when helicopters fired on their white van. All three exited the vehicle, but one fell, his legs filled with shrapnel. A follow-up strike targeted the group again, killing the two cousins and blowing off a chunk of Barakat's right arm. The cousins died of shrapnel wounds to the chest, according to autopsy reports by a Syrian doctor with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, an international medical group. Several relatives said the cousins operated a van service and had no connection to ISIL or any armed group; Barakat said the van carried no weapons. Relatives provided video and photos of the scene and the destroyed van to NPR. An unidentified U.S. defense official told NPR by email that it was the first civilian casualty report they received related to the raid, and that initial reports suggested that a white van in the vicinity had fired on U.S. helicopters. \\"Surveillance footage will be reviewed to determine if an investigation needs to be opened based upon this additional information,\\" the official said. Former Pentagon intelligence analyst Marc Garlasco suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by Hydra 70 rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \\"squirters\\"‚Äîpeople perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid. Analysis A November 6, 2019 Brookings Institution analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \\"power and resolve\\" in the War on Terror, remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: intelligence collection, international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. hard power and soft power that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of HUMINT, SIGINT, and visual intelligence gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting close-quarters obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \\"Find, Fix, Finish\\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish). A November 19, 2019 Department of Defense Inspector General report, citing Defense Intelligence Agency assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \\"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\\" and that his demise \\"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis. A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate, as the group's command structure was fairly decentralized by the time of the raid. Reactions Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the raid was the outcome of intelligence sharing between parties on the ground and thanked those involved in the operation. =ISIL response and subsequent operations= News of the death of Baghdadi was ignored by official ISIL channels for days and the group did not immediately confirm his death. Many ISIL supporters refused to believe he was dead, while some others accepted it. Supporters of ISIL's rival jihadist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and al-Qaeda praised his death because of his group's noted record for cruelty. Salafi cleric Abdullah al-Muhaysini celebrated Baghdadi's demise and called on ISIL members to defect. The activity of jihadist supporters in general temporarily decreased online as well. ISIL's Amaq News Agency confirmed Baghdadi's death on October 31 and announced Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi as his successor. Abu Hamza al-Qurayshi became their new spokesman after its prior spokesperson, Abul-Hasan al-Muhajir, was killed in an October 27 U.S. strike in northwest Syria following the Barisha raid. In an audio message, Hamza al- Qurayshi described U.S. President Donald Trump as \\"a crazy old man\\" and warned the U.S. to \\"not rejoice\\" and that ISIL supporter would avenge Baghdadi's death. Since Baghdadi's death several of the leaders operating under him have been killed or captured, along with some of his family members: On November 4, Turkish communications director Fahrettin Altun stated that Rasmiya Awad, Baghdadi's lesser-known older sister, had been captured. According to Reuters, citing Turkish officials, Awad was captured in a raid on a shipping container in the Turkish-controlled Syrian border town of Azaz and that Turkish authorities were interrogating her husband and daughter-in-law who were also detained. When captured, she was also accompanied by five children. \\"We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi‚Äôs sister on the inner workings of ISIS,\\" Altun stated. Little independent information is available on Baghdadi's sister and Reuters was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her. On December 3, Iraqi security forces announced the capture of Baghdadi's \\"deputy\\" who operated under the name \\"Abu Khaldoun\\". According to security officials, a police unit in Hawija, Kirkuk Governorate, Iraq, tracked down Khaldoun to an apartment in the March 1 area where he was hiding; he possessed a fake I.D. under the name of Shaalan Obeid when apprehended. Khaldoun was previously ISIL's \\"military prince\\" of Iraq's Saladin Governorate. On December 26, Boko Haram, the West African branch of ISIL, killed 11 captives in what the group called a \\"message for Christians\\" and a retaliation for the killing of Baghdadi and Abul-Hasan al-Muhajir. =International= Representatives of several countries, including Australia, France, Israel, and the United Kingdom, congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL. * ‚Äì Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the raid's result, if confirmed, represented a serious contribution by the United States toward combating terrorism. * ‚Äì Iran, on the other hand, stated that Baghdadi's death was not significant and that the actions of the United States are responsible for the rise of ISIL. Iran said that the killing of Baghdadi did not mean the group's end, as sectarianism and terrorism still very much exist and are being exploited by countries like the U.S. * ‚Äì In an interview with the French magazine Paris Match published on November 27, 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad dismissed any suggestion the Syrian government had anything to do with the raid and affirmed his skepticism of the operation's success, calling it a \\"fantastic play staged by the Americans\\" and quipping \\"...was al-Baghdadi really killed or not?\\" Assad made similar remarks to Syria TV weeks prior, calling the operation \\"little more than a trick\\" and likening U.S. politics to Hollywood. * ‚Äì Mohammed bin Salman commended Trump on the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, describing the event as a turning point in the fight against extremism. Saudi Arabia said Baghdadi had perverted the reputation of Islam and welcomed his death at the hands of US commandos. The kingdom said it is thankful to the US for its efforts to track members of this terrorist organization. * ‚Äì Egypt said the death marked a significant achievement in the efforts to combat extremism. The country also advocated for a comprehensive approach that acknowledged the security, developmental, and theoretical dimensions in the battle against armed actors. * ‚Äì President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said al-Baghdadi's killing was a turning point in the fight against terrorism. * ‚Äì Afghanistan praised al-Baghdadi's killing as a significant blow and anticipated it would weaken ISIL's activities in Afghanistan. * ‚Äì Jordan characterized al-Baghdadi's death as a major step in the battle against terrorists and their principles of hate. The country also said it will remain on the frontlines to eradicate extremism in partnership with its allies. * ‚Äì Bahrain lauded the raid and said it was a \\"fatal blow to the group.\\" * ‚Äì Japan said the death of al-Baghdadi was a crucial turning point towards serenity and stability in the Middle East. However, the country also cautioned that the war against terrorism had not ended. * ‚Äì The Philippines said Baghdadi's death was only a temporary setback for the group because of ISIL's comprehensiveness and reach worldwide. * ‚Äì Iraq noted its part in locating Baghdadi and said it would continue to track and prosecute the organization. * ‚Äì The prime minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe congratulated President Donald Trump after the raid. He said that IS has been fomenting horror and dismay across the globe and that the operation makes the world a more secure place. * ‚Äì The German government took the time to reflect on the victims of IS after the raid. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Baghdadi can't order any more killings, but added that the fight against the organization will continue. * ‚Äì U.N. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said the death of Baghdadi was a good time to remember the casualties of terrorism. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that IS had perpetrated wicked human rights violations and ushered in disaster and death to thousands of men, women, and children. Lastly, he added the world has made visible progress against Daesh. * ‚Äì The European Union said the death of Baghdadi was a major blow to the organization but warned that it still remains a major threat. * ‚Äì NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg stated the raid was a great accomplishment in the efforts against global terrorism.

It was built by the former Oberrheinischen Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG (Upper Rhine Railway Company, OEG), later MVV OEG AG and is now operated by MVV Verkehr GmbH (infrastructure owner) and RNV (operations manager and train operator) according to Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung f√ºr Schmalspurbahnen (narrow- gauge railway regulations; ESBO). However, the 6.5 km-long line is still owned by MVV Verkehr AG (the City of Mannheim‚Äôs transport utility) as the successor to the OEG. It is operated as a branch line using electronic direct traffic control.  History The line was opened on 1 May 1909 by the South German Railway Company (S√ºddeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG, SEG) as a branch of the Mannheim‚ÄìWeinheim line, which was opened in 1887. However, it was sometimes unpopular among the people of Wallstadt, as the nearby terminus of the Feudenheim‚ÄìMannheim tram line had a cheaper fare, a more frequent service and a better connection to downtown Mannheim, so many people preferred to walk from Wallstadt to Feudenheim. The K√§fertal‚ÄìHeddesheim branch line has been operated electrically since 1 November 1946. The electrification was carried out with material from the disused Feudenheim‚ÄìMannheim line. The local signal boxes were replaced by automatic block signaling in 1979. The line was then controlled by the signal box in K√§fertal, which was put into operation in 1978. Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen set running as line 4 in Wallstadt station The MVG 2000 concept, which led to big changes for the OEG, was implemented in 1995. The line to Heddesheim became part of a tram line of the former MVG and Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen GmbH (VBL). After that, tram line 4 replaced the OEG service and ran continuously from Heddesheim to Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim and Bad D√ºrkheim. The second track at Im Rott station was opened on 9 September 2001. Due to the increased demand from new residential areas in Wallstadt, there was support for a reduction of services intervals from 20 minutes to ten minutes. This was not possible because of the single-track line to Heddesheim. In 2012, a balloon loop was built to the east of the overpass built over the A6 in 2008. The loop was put into operation on schedule in December 2012. The whole signal infrastructure and signalling operations were renewed between 2010 and 2014. Since the spring of 2014, the entire line has been equipped with the \\"Ks\\" signalling system (Ks-Signalsystem), a new colour light signals system being introduced in Germany.  Operations  Originally passenger traffic on the line was operated as one of four independently operated OEG lines, but it had no line designation. The carriage shed was in Heddesheim. Operations were discontinued due to the Second World War from 26 March to 18 June 1945. After the completion of the electrification of the OEG line, the service on the line was extended to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof and designated as line C. Trains ran every 24 minutes from 2 June 1957, but they did not continue to Mannheim in the mornings until 29 September 1963. A reduced timetable with less regular intervals was operated from 1 July 1971 to 31 June 1973; in the evenings trains were replaced by buses. From 28 May 1978 trains only ran as far as K√§fertal on Sundays; later this also applied to services at lunchtime on non-school days. The Duewag-GT6 sets were replaced with B4 trailer cars from July 1982 until 21 May 1993. Another half-hour cycle was introduced on 23 May 1993 and additional trains ran between Schriesheim and Heidelberg. The top speed was increased from 60 km/h to 80 km/h. Since 24 September 1995, the line from K√§fertal to Heddesheim has been served by the MVV (later MVV-V) tram line 4 from Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim, which was extended from K√§fertal. In December 2008, the Bad D√ºrkheim‚ÄìLudwigshafen-Oggersheim railway, which previously ran to Mannheim-Innenstadt (inner city), was integrated into tram line 4. The connection to Bad D√ºrkheim was trialled earlier in evening traffic. GT6N trams were normally used, although RNV8ER trams operated occasionally. With the opening of the tram line to Gartenstadt in June 2016, it became the new destination for trams on line 4 from Bad D√ºrkheim, so the trains from Heddesheim to K√§fertal now run as line 5A, instead of line 5 as previously, and continue to Edingen. In the peak hour, when formerly no line 5 services ended in K√§fertal, the line 5A services now run to the city centre and return to Wallstadt as line 15. Originally it was planned to separate a portion in K√§fertal that would run on the OEG's circuit line.

Biography Avital Inbar was born in Tel Aviv. His parents, Mordechai Burstein, a native of the Kiev region and Rachel Shilensky, born in Kaunas, Lithuania, were intellectuals and polyglots. They spent much of their lives in France and were imbued in its culture. From the age of thirteen to twenty-six he lived in France, including two years in Marseille, where he learned French, and two years in what was at the time French Algeria, which was in the midst of a war of independence. These intense, unmediated impressions still affect his perspective of the Jewish- Palestinian conflict and internal Israeli divisions. In Paris, he graduated high school at the Alliance Gymnasium, where he studied philosophy from the famous Emmanuel Levinas. He then earned his degree at the Paris Institute of Political Sciences. On his return to Israel in 1970, he served as a foreign correspondent for French media, among others, for the daily Combat, founded by Albert Camus. Since 1976, Inbar has focused on literary translation and he had translated into Hebrew several major works of French literature, as well as some English titles. He traveled frequently to Paris to meet with publishers and writers and to choose titles for translation for Israeli publishers. He became friends with leading French figures, such as Marguerite Duras and Yves Montand. Altogether, he has translated some 120 titles. In 1995, together with the French-Israeli businessman Jean Frydman, he founded the Yonatan Guides Ltd., which received a franchise from the French restaurant and hotel guide Gault Millau to produce a similar guide in Israel. Since 1997, Inbar wrote nine experiential, hedonistic, travel books dedicated to France and its regions.https://www.calcalist.co.il/consumer/articles/0,7340,L-3723793,00.html He also wrote Parisian Pictures, devoted mainly to his encounters with writers and artists in France and the complex relations between France, Israel and the Jews. Since 2018 he has been focusing on Japanese Cuisine and in 2019 published Gourmand in Tokyo, dedicated to Japanese gastronomy. Awards For his literary work and the dissemination of French culture in Israel, he received two decorations from the French government ‚Äí officer in the Ordre des Arts et des LettresOrdre des Arts et des Lettres award letter and officer in the Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques.Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques award letter, May 9, 1988 In July 2019, Inbar was conferred French citizenship, for his contribution to the influence of France and the prosperity of international economic relations.French citizenship award Published work = Books Published in Hebrew= Gault Millau Guide- Israel restaurant guides 1996 ‚Äì 2003, Yonatan Guides Publisher, Tel Aviv The Pleasures of France, A.

He was a member of the Weimar National Assembly, the Danzig Volkstag parliament and mayor of Neuteich (Nowy Staw). Reek was born in Danzig, West Prussia, German Empire (Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) and attended the St. Katharinen school in Danzig. He was trained as a carpenter and spent his journeyman years from 1895 to 1900 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. From 1900 to 1902 he served in the Prussian Army and became the chairman of the Central Federation of carpenters in Danzig in 1902. During World War I Reek initially served in the German army but started to work in several positions in the Kriegsern√§hrungsamt in Danzig in 1916. In 1917 he headed the press commission of the socialdemocratic Volkswacht newspaper in Danzig. In 1918 he was elected to the town council of Danzig and on 19 January 1919 as a member of the Weimar National Assembly, he lost his seat after Danzig became a Free City according to the Treaty of Versailles. Since 1919 Reek worked as Secretary of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund in Danzig. In 1925 he was elected the mayor of Neuteich and in 1925/1926 he was an honorary Senator in Heinrich Sahm's Danzig Senate. From 1928 on he served as Senator in the Senate of Danzig again. The circumstances of Reek's death are reported in divergent versions. He either died from a stroke or was killed in SA \\"Schutzhaft\\" on 12 or 19 May 1933.

In the , Bogie had a population of 161 people.  Geography  The terrain is mountainous and relatively undeveloped. The principal land use is grazing on native vegetation. The Bowen Developmental Road passes through the middle of the locality from the south-west (Springlands) to the north-east (Bowen). The Newlands railway system roughly follows the same route as the road through the locality.  History  On 4 December 1956 the Queensland Government opened for selection a grazing lot of being portions 33 and 34, parish of Adaleigh, County of Herbert in the Bowen Land Agent's district and the Shire of Wangaratta (). It was west of the Bogie Range and the Bogie River flowed through the property. The property is known as Reedy Creek as at 2020.  Education  There are no schools in Bogie. Given the extensive size of the locality and limited road network, the school options would depend on the home location. For primary schooling, the options as Osborne State School in Osborne, Gumlu State School in Gumlu, Collinsville State School in Collinsville, Merinda State School and Bowen State School both in Bowen, and Proserpine State School in Proserpine. For secondary schooling, the options are Bowen State High School in Bowen and Collinsville State High School in Collinsville. The northern and southern parts of Bogie are considered too remote for normal secondary school attendance; the options in these areas would be distance education or boarding schools.

Films * Akira: Warner Bros. acquired the rights to make a live-action American adaptation of the anime film and its manga of the same name in 2002, and have made a number of attempts to film it. Directors attached to the project since 2002 have included James Cameron, Stephen Norrington, Ruair√≠ Robinson, the Hughes brothers, George Miller, Christopher Nolan and Jaume Collet-Serra. It was announced in 2019 that filming would be done later that year, in a production produced by Andrew Lazar and Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Taika Waititi. The filming was delayed in August 2019 owing to Waititi's commitment to direct the Marvel Studios film Thor: Love and Thunder. * Alien vs. Predator: Alien vs. Predator was first planned shortly after the 1990 release of Predator 2, to be released sometime in 1993. It was halted for more than a decade, with constant actor changes, restarts, and failed promotions of the film until it was finally released in 2004. * Alita: Battle Angel: James Cameron's live- action adaptation of Yukito Kishiro's manga series Battle Angel Alita was in development hell starting in the early 2000s. The project was finally completed under the direction of Robert Rodriguez, and released in 2019. * Atlas Shrugged: Film and later television adaptations of Ayn Rand's novel were in development hell for nearly 40 years before the novel was finally brought to screen in the first part of a trilogy in 2011. Part II appeared in 2012, and Part III was released in September 2014. * Atuk: A film adaptation of the novel The Incomparable Atuk. Norman Jewison first purchased the film rights in 1971, and since then there have been several attempts to produce it. One Hollywood legend holds that the project is cursed, because of the premature deaths of various actors who expressed an interest in the lead role: John Belushi, Sam Kinison, John Candy, Phil Hartman and Chris Farley. * Avatar sequels: These films were first announced in 2010, aiming for a release of the second installment by 2014. The timeline has been pushed back a total of 8 times. * Bajirao Mastani: The film was conceived in the 1990s and was finally announced in 2003 but was shelved indefinitely owing to its ever-changing cast. The film was finally revived in 2014 and went immediately in production and was released in December 2015. * Beetlejuice 2: In 1990, Tim Burton commissioned a sequel to Beetlejuice called Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, written by Jonathan Gems. After multiple studio rewrites, in 1997 Gems stated that the film will never be made. In 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith to write and produce a sequel. In 2013, Winona Ryder expressed her interest in the sequel saying, \\"I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later.\\" In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith said the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In April 2019, Warner Bros. stated the sequel had been shelved. * Bill & Ted Face the Music: an attempt to revive Bill & Ted came to fruition in August 2010 when franchise star Keanu Reeves indicated that a script for a third film was being worked on despite the fact that the character Rufus would not return, because original actor (George Carlin) had died two years prior. Dean Parisot was attached to direct by August 2012. In March 2013 at the SXSW Film Festival, Alex Winter confirmed progress on the film was still being made. In April 2016, Winter told Forbes that they had a script, a director, and a studio, and that they were planning to film by early 2017. Reeves gave an update on the film in February 2017 during an interview on The Graham Norton Show, saying the story was written, and discussing the plot of the film: \\"Basically, they're supposed to write a song to save the world, and they haven't done that. The pressure of having to save the world, their marriages are falling apart, their kids are kind of mad at them, and then someone comes from the future and tells them if they don't write the song it's just not the world, it's the universe. So they have to save the universe because time is breaking apart\\". During the New York City Comic Convention, Reeves revealed that the title will be Bill & Ted Face the Music. The film was released on August 28, 2020. * Blair Witch 3, a third film in the Blair Witch franchise was in talks since the October 2000 release of Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Despite rumors, development did not begin until September 2009 when creators Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S√°nchez announced a third film in the works from Lionsgate, retconning any events from Book of Shadows. After several scripts be tossed around, Simon Barrett's script was pitched with Adam Wingard announced as director in 2013 under its working title, The Woods. The film‚Äîsimply under its name, Blair Witch‚Äîwas released on September 16, 2016 with polarizing reactions from critics and audiences, and was a disappointment at the box office. * A Confederacy of Dunces, the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, has had a motion picture adaptation announced at least seven times, with some of the attempts even making it to a full script being written and most of the major characters of the novel cast, only to always stall and be abandoned... * Dallas Buyers Club: The screenplay was written in September 1992 by Craig Borten. Throughout the 1990s, he wrote 10 different scripts, hoping for it to be picked up. It was unable to secure financial backing, going through three different directors, finally being released in 2013, with Jean-Marc Vall√©e directing. * The Dark Tower: An adaptation of The Dark Tower had been in development since at least 2007. The film was eventually released on August 4, 2017. * Deadpool: Deadpool was in development hell for more than 15 years. In May 2000, Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment to coproduce, finance and distribute a film based on American comic books publisher Marvel Comics character Deadpool. In February 2004, New Line Cinema attempted to produce a Deadpool film with writer/director David S. Goyer working on the spin-off and actor Ryan Reynolds in the title role; Reynolds himself became interested in the character after finding out that in Cable & Deadpool, Deadpool refers to his own scarred appearance as \\"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei\\".Cable & Deadpool #2, p. 13 By August, Goyer lost interest in favor of other projects. In March 2005, after New Line put Deadpool in turnaround, 20th Century Fox became interested in moving forward on production for the project. Fox considered a Deadpool spin-off early in the development of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which had Reynolds cast in the role, and after the opening weekend success of that film announced that it was lending Deadpool out to writers, with Lauren Shuler Donner acting as a producer. Donner wanted the film to reboot the character of Deadpool, ignoring the version in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and including attributes that the character has in the comics, such as breaking the fourth wall. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January 2010, and Robert Rodriguez was sent an early draft of the screenplay that June. After negotiations with Rodriguez fell through, Adam Berg emerged as a top contender to direct. In April 2011, visual effects specialist Tim Miller was hired as director, making the film his directorial debut. In September 2014, Fox gave the film a release date of February 12, 2016. The film was released on that date to positive reviews and became the ninth highest-grossing film of 2016 worldwide, as well as the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until it was surpassed by Joker 3 years later. * Death Note: This 2017 neo-noir supernatural teen horror film, loosely based on the Japanese manga and anime of the same names respectively, was in development since August 2007. The American production company Vertigo Entertainment was originally set to develop the remake, with Charley and Vlas Parlapanides as screenwriters and Roy Lee, Doug Davison, Dan Lin, and Brian Witten as producers. On April 30, 2009, Variety reported that Warner Bros., the distributors for the original Japanese live-action films, had acquired the rights for an American remake, with the original screenwriters and producers still attached. In 2009, Zac Efron responded to rumors that he would be playing the film's lead role by stating that the project was \\"not on the front burner\\". On January 13, 2011, it was announced that Shane Black had been hired to direct the film, with the script being written by Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry. Warner's studios planned to change the background story of Light Yagami into one of vengeance instead of justice and to remove Shinigami from the story. Black opposed this change, and it had not been green-lit. Black confirmed in a 2013 interview with Bleeding Cool that he was still working on the film. In July 2014, it was rumored that Gus Van Sant would replace Black as the film's new director, with Dan Lin, Doug Davison, Roy Lee and Brian Witten producing through Vertigo Entertainment, Witten Pictures and Lin Pictures. The film was eventually directed by Adam Wingard and was distributed by Netflix for an August 2017 release and received mostly negative reviews. * Foodfight!: In 2004, the CGI film Foodfight was announced. Described as \\"Toy Story in a supermarket\\", the film promised to bring together over 80 famous advertising characters with voice talent including Charlie Sheen, Christopher Lloyd, Eva Longoria, Hilary and Haylie Duff, and Wayne Brady. Director Lawrence Kasanoff expected it to be a commercial hit and merchandise for the movie appeared on store shelves before the film had a release date. However, the film ran into many problems. In late 2002/early 2003, Kasanoff reported that hard drives containing unfinished assets from the film had been stolen in what he called an act of \\"industrial espionage\\". After several years, a trailer was finally shown at AHM in 2011, a company bought the DVD distribution rights for the film in Europe, and a quiet video-on-demand American release came in 2012. * ID Forever Part I and II: The sequels to Independence Day were in development hell from 1997 until 2009, when director Roland Emmerich announced the pre- production of the films, which were planned to be shot back-to-back. However, ID Forever Part I was renamed to Independence Day: Resurgence for its release on June 24, 2016. * The Irishman: The film had been in development since 2007. It went on to have its world premiere at the 57th New York Film Festival on September 27, 2019 and received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on November 27, 2019 by Netflix. * Jurassic World: The fourth film of the Jurassic Park series was in development hell ever since the release of Jurassic Park III in 2001 when it was first announced. After scheduling and release conflicts, the fourth film was eventually retooled as a soft reboot known as Jurassic World, which was released theatrically on June 12, 2015. * Mad Max: Fury Road: In 1995, George Miller re-acquired the rights to future Mad Max films from Warner Bros. The idea for a fourth occurred to Miller in August 1998 when he was walking in an intersection in Los Angeles. About a year later, while travelling from Los Angeles to Australia, the idea coalesced. Miller conceived a story where \\"violent marauders were fighting, not for oil or for material goods, but for human beings.\\" The film was set to shoot in 2001 through 20th Century Fox, but was postponed because of the September 11 attacks that same year. \\"The American dollar collapsed against the Australian dollar, and our budget ballooned\\", Miller said, adding that he \\"had to move on to Happy Feet because there was a small window when that was ready\\". Mel Gibson, who starred in the original three previous films, would not return to his role as the lead character. Miller ended up re-casting the role because of controversies surrounding Gibson and because he wanted Max to remain at a younger age, as the \\"same contemporary warrior\\". Miller announced in 2003 that a script had been written for a fourth film, and that pre-production was in the early stages.Source: Metro, Toronto, Canada. 11 December 2002. The project was given the green light to begin filming in the Australian desert in May 2003 with a budget of US$100 million, but the location was ruined by rainfall. Mad Max 4 entered then a hiatus in light of security concerns related to its Namibian shoot because of tightened travel and shipping restrictions at the onset of the Iraq War. By 2007, after focusing on the animated musical-comedy Happy Feet, Miller decided to pursue the project again. He briefly considered producing Fury Road as a computer-animated film but abandoned it in favor of live-action. In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Tom Hardy was cast as the title character in June 2010, with production planned to begin that November. Principal photography was delayed several more times before beginning in July 2012. The film wrapped in December 2012, although additional footage was shot in November 2013. The film was finally released on May 15, 2015 with critical acclaim although after the release of the film in question, there have been results of ongoing pay dispute between Warner Bros. and Miller as to producing sequels to the film over the years. * The Man Who Killed Don Quixote: A loose adaptation of the Don Quixote tale co- written and directed by Terry Gilliam. Production originally started in 1998, but during the shooting in 2000, a significant number of difficulties such as set and equipment destroyed by flooding, the departure of the film's lead owing to illness, problems obtaining insurance for the production, and other financial difficulties, led to a sudden suspension of the production and its subsequent cancellation. Part of the development hell is shown in documentary Lost in La Mancha. Gilliam made several additional attempts to revive the project until filming finally completed in 2017 and the finished film was released the following year. * Pinocchio: a darker stop-motion animated adaption of the Italian novel The Adventures of Pinocchio was conceived by Guillermo del Toro in 2008. On February 17, 2011, it was announced that Gris Grimly and Mark Gustafson would co-direct the film written by del Toro and Matthew Robbins. On May 17, 2012, del Toro took over for Grimly. The movie was initially scheduled to be released in 2014, but the project was in development hell and no further informations were made for years since that. In January 2017, Patrick McHale was announced to co-write the script. On August 31, 2017, del Toro told that the film need a budget increase of $35 million. In November 2017, del Toro reported that the project was cancelled, because no studios were willing to finance it. However, on October 22, 2018, it was announced that the film had been revived, with Netflix acquiring it for a 2021 release. * The Postman: Author David Brin described the ten-year effort to get his novel produced as a film. Production began in 1987, but the final film was not released until 1997. In the process, the screenplay went through so many revisions that the shooting script only loosely resembled the book, and later writers \\"borrowed\\" elements from the book to improve the film. The film was a box-office bomb and was negatively reviewed. * Sangam (Hindi for \\"Union\\") is an Indian film that was kept in development hell for at least 15 years. It was under the original title \\"Gharoanda\\" (Hindi for \\"nest\\", literally \\"house of twigs\\") but was kept of by company R.K. Films, owned by actor Raj Kapoor, for a couple of reasons. Then, in 1963, it would be remade as Sangam, and would star Raj Kapoor, Vyjayanthimala, Rajendra Kumar, and more. It was released in 1964 with a duration of about 4 hours, being the first Hindi film with two intervals. It did commercially well at the box office. * Sonic the Hedgehog: The film based on Sega's own flagship video game character was in development hell going as back as 1994 when studios such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and DreamWorks dropped the script for a Sonic film. It was until in 2013, Sony Pictures announced that its Columbia Pictures brand and Original Film acquired the rights to the video game series and would be a joint venture with Sega's owned Marza Animation Planet and Blur Studio. But in October 2017, Paramount Pictures announced that they had acquired the rights after Sony's Columbia Pictures put the film into turnaround. In February 2018, it was announced that the film would be released on November 15, 2019. However, after negative reactions from the first trailer, the studio changed its official theatrical release date to February 14, 2020 for more retooling by Moving Picture Company. The film was a box office success but received mixed reviews from critics. * Space Jam: A New Legacy: A sequel to the 1996 live-action/animated hybrid Space Jam was in the works in 1997, with Joe Pytka from the first film to direct, Bob Camp to design an all-new character, Berserk-O! and his henchmen, and Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone signing on as the animation supervisors. The potential sequel reentered development as Spy Jam and was to star Jackie Chan in a different script. The studio was also planning a film titled Race Jam which would have starred Jeff Gordon. Additionally, Pytka revealed that following the first film's success, he had been pitched a story for a sequel that would have starred professional golfer Tiger Woods, with Jordan in a smaller role. Pytka explained how the idea came from an out of studio script conference, with people who worked on the original film allegedly involved. Another idea for a Space Jam sequel entitled Skate Jam was in early development with Tony Hawk in the starring role. Plans were underway for production to begin immediately following the release of Looney Tunes: Back in Action, but it was cancelled given that film's poor box office performance despite otherwise improved critical reception from Space Jam. Over 10 years later however, talks for a sequel were resurrected with LeBron James as the main star. Filming began from June 25 to September 26, 2019 with Malcolm D. Lee helming as director. In addition, in March 2020, photos during the shooting were leaked as Warner Bros. characters aside from the Looney Tunes would also appear in the film, such as Superman, Batman, Pennywise, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, Harry Potter, Joker, Gollum, Bane, Scorpion and Sub- Zero, Agent Smith, Mad Max, Finn and Jake, The Mask, the Gremlins, Tom and Jerry, Austin Powers, King Leodias, George the Gorilla, Dr. Manhattan, Harold and Kumar, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, among others. The film, currently known as Space Jam: A New Legacy, is scheduled for a July 16, 2021 release. * Speed Racer: A live-action Speed Racer film was in the works since 1992 when Warner Bros. opted the rights to make a film version of it in co-junction with Silver Pictures. In October 1994, singer Henry Rollins was offered the role of Racer X. In June 1995, Johnny Depp was cast into the lead role for Speed Racer, with production slated to begin the coming October, In September 2000, Warner Bros. and producer Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer-director Hype Williams to take the helm of the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded a revival of the project by presenting a take for the film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer. With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project. However, The Wachowskis were brought on board by the studio to write and direct the film in October 2006. The film was released on May 9, 2008. Although critics gave it mixed reviews and was a box office bomb, it was received positively by fans. * Superman Lives: The name given to a project begun by producer Jon Peters in 1993 as Superman Reborn. The proposed film would have followed the comic story line known as The Death of Superman. Jonathan Lemkin was hired to write the initial script, but Peters brought on a series of additional screenwriters to overhaul the script, including Gregory Poirier in 1995 and Kevin Smith in 1996. Director Tim Burton became attached to the film, with Nicolas Cage cast as the Man of Steel, and several more screenwriters were brought on board for several more rewrites. Burton backed out in late 1998 citing differences with producer Peters and the studios, opting instead to direct Sleepy Hollow. Additional writers and directors were attached to the project at various times over the next few years. Peters' project went through several more permutations before evolving into Superman Returns, released in 2006, 13 years after initial development began. The film's journey through development hell was later explored by a documentary on the topic, The Death of \\"Superman Lives\\": What Happened?, released in 2015. * Tomb Raider: A film reboot of the franchise based on the same name was announced by producer Graham King and studios Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. back in 2009. Stars like Olivia Wilde, Kristen Stewart and Megan Fox were originally slated to audition the role as Lara Croft. It was announced in 2015 during the release of 20th Century Fox's Hitman: Agent 47, Adrian Askarieh, producer of the Hitman films, stated that he hoped to oversee a shared universe of Square Enix films with Just Cause, Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, and Thief, but admitted that he does not have the rights to Tomb Raider. In May 2017, the Game Central reporters at Metro UK suggested that the shared universe was unlikely, pointing out that no progress had been made on any Just Cause, Deus Ex nor Thief films. Deadline Hollywood had previously reported that Daisy Ridley was considered for the role, though she later stated in an interview with Vogue that it was just the \\"craziest rumor\\" she had ever heard about herself. Eventually the role was given to Alicia Vikander as the titular character and the film was released on March 16, 2018 with mixed reception from critics. A sequel is scheduled to be released on March 19, 2021. *Tom & Jerry: Plans for a new theatrical Tom and Jerry movie was planned in 2009, as a live-action/CGI film following the success of Alvin and the Chipmunks. 6 years later, Warner Bros. wants to put a renewed focus on animation and plans changed from a full-on live-action film to a full-on animated film. 3 years later, plans have officially been finalized as a live-action/animated hybrid that began to film in 2019, originally planned to be released on April 16, 2021. The movie has had a lot of time put through as it was then pushed back for a December 23, 2020 release. The film is now officially scheduled for a March 5, 2021 release. * Uncharted: A film based on Naughty Dog's Uncharted games was in development since 2008 when film producer Avi Arad stated that he was working with a division of Sony to develop the film adaptation of Uncharted. The film was at first to be written by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer, produced by Arad, Charles Roven, and Alex Gartner, and directed by David O. Russell. On November 24, 2010, an interview with Mark Wahlberg was published by MTV with the actor discussing his involvement in the film adaptation of the popular franchise. He stated that David O. Russell was currently writing the script and was excited for what he had in store, hoping to shoot in the middle of 2011: \\"I'm obviously in whatever David wants to do but the idea of it is so off the charts: De Niro being my father, Pesci being my uncle. It's not going to be the watered-down version, that's for sure.\\" On May 26, 2011, it was reported that David O. Russell had dropped out from directing the video game film, with a new screenwriter being sought by Columbia Pictures. In May 2017, Tom Holland was cast as a young Nathan Drake, with the film serving as a prequel to the games. TV writer Rafe Judkins was brought on to rework the script. On December 19, 2018, it was announced that Levy had stepped down from directing the movie. On January 14, 2019, Variety reported that Dan Trachtenberg had signed on to direct the film. On August 22, 2019, Deadline reported that Dan Trachtenberg had exited the film, with the film scheduled to go into production in early 2020. The film will become the first feature production of Sony PlayStation Productions. On September 27, 2019, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Travis Knight will direct the film. On November 13, 2019, Variety reported that Mark Wahlberg was in final talks to co-star in the film as Victor ‚ÄúSully‚Äù Sullivan. In December 2019, Knight left the project because of scheduling conflicts with Holland. Deadline reported in January 2020 that Sony has delayed the film from a December 11, 2020 release to a March 5, 2021 release. In March, Antonio Banderas, Sophia Taylor Ali and Tati Gabrielle were added to the cast, with a new script from Iron Man writers Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. Principal photography began on March 16, 2020, with Ruben Fleischer directing, shooting in Berlin, but was shut down in mid- March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was believed filming had resumed on July 15, 2020, however Sony Pictures clarified, while production has not yet resumed, they were undergoing preparations with the hope to start production soon. Production resumed on July 20, shooting in areas around Germany, with proper social distancing and mask requirements being implemented on and off the set. On September 16, 2020, filming moved to Berlin, with set photos being released online. Owing to the pandemic, the film's release date was delayed to October 8, 2021. The film was moved up to July 16, 2021, taking the original release date of the untitled Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel. * Warcraft: A live-action adaptation of the Warcraft series was first announced in 2006. The film spent several years in development hell before the project advanced. It was scheduled for a 2016 release. The film was released in June 2016 worldwide with a Paris premiere in May. * Watchmen: The 2009 film based on the Alan Moore graphic novel from DC Comics had undergone much various production problems; such as penning the script from four different studios and directors and attaching different screenwriters for the project; thus halted the adaptation's development through twenty years. That was until 2006, when Zack Snyder, fresh out of production of then soon to be released 300, was hired as director for the film. It was eventually released on March 6, 2009 with mixed reactions from critics and was a moderate success worldwide at the box office; but received more acclaim from fans gaining more of a cult following over the years. Music * Chinese Democracy: Rock band Guns N' Roses began work on this album in the late 1990s. In the time between its conception and release, nearly the entire lineup of the band had changed numerous times. It was once dubbed by The New York Times \\"The Most Expensive Album Never Made\\". Recorded in 14 separate studios with reported production costs of $13 million, Chinese Democracy was eventually released in November 2008.Powers, Ann. Review: Chinese Democracy . Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on April 9, 2010. * Detox: A studio album by American hip hop recording artist Dr. Dre, slated to be his swan song album, was originally slated for release between 2011 and 2012 due to be released through Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Production for Detox began in 2000, but has been delayed several times as Dr. Dre wanted to concentrate on producing for artists that were on his Aftermath record label. Work for the upcoming album dates back to 2001, where its first version was called \\"the most advanced rap album ever,\\" by producer Scott Storch. Even at the beginning of Detoxs production, it was announced that it would be Dr. Dre's final studio album, which has been confirmed at different points throughout the album's 10-year production process. Because Dr. Dre had stated he was tired of rapping about marijuana use and stereotypical gangster lifestyle, he planned to make Detox a hip-hop musical telling the story of a professional hitman and his family, with an intended summer 2003 release date. Initially announced in 2000 after the release of Dr. Dre's previous album 2001 (1999), Detox has gone through many renditions during its 11-year production period, failing to have a confirmed release date, due to Dr. Dre believing the project \\"wasn't good enough\\". However the album spawned two official singles, \\"Kush\\" and \\"I Need a Doctor\\". In January 2004, co-producer Scott Storch listed guest appearances such as 50 Cent, Eminem, Game, and Snoop Dogg. Keri Hilson told Rap-Up that she had recorded material for the album but was unsure if the tracks would make the final cut. J. Cole stated that he recorded with Dre but refused to explain. The album's production was eventually cancelled on August 1, 2015, with Dr. Dre instead releasing a brand-new album, Compton, inspired by the concurrent production of the film Straight Outta Compton, a week later on August 7. *Fear Inoculum: Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan announced at the 50th Grammy Awards in February 2008 that the band would start working on a follow up to their 2006 album 10,000 Days \\"right away\\". However, a number of creative, personal, and legal issues delayed the writing and recording of the album, which was eventually released at the end of August 2019. *I/O: The hypothetical tenth studio album from British art pop musician Peter Gabriel, I/O began production in April 1995 following the conclusion of Gabriel's Secret World tour, concurrently with his seventh studio album, Up (itself not released until 2002).\\"Peter Gabriel's \\"Up\\" Is A Downer, But In a Good Way\\", by Jon Wiederhorn, 10 March 2002. MTV.com.‚Äî Peter Gabriel: Had a Nice Decade by Franklin Cumberbatch, 27 September 2002. VH1.com Gabriel originally stated that the album would be released in 2004,‚Äî Richard Chappell: Recording Peter Gabriel's Up by Paul Tingen. only for extensive touring in support of Up to delay these plans considerably. Gabriel repeatedly gave vague updates on the album's production over the following years, first stating in 2008 that he was \\"shifting focus\\" towards both I/O and his cover album Scratch My Back (which saw release in 2010) before later claiming in 2011 that I/O was still just a number of unfinished \\"song ideas\\" that he had yet to elaborate upon.Rolling Stone (Peter Gabriel interview, 10 Oct 2011) Gabriel would continue to post about the album's production during the remainder of the 2010s, ultimately stating on BBC Radio in April 2019 that he was planning on finishing songwriting for I/O by the end of the year. Despite his plans to \\"get a record out\\" by early 2020, the album still remains unreleased as of August, with no release date set. * The Smile Sessions: Archival recordings of the Beach Boys unfinished album Smile took nearly 45 years to compile for a dedicated release. Numerous complications contributed to its excessively protracted delay, including bandleader Brian Wilson's irrational fear of the album. Brother and bandmate Carl Wilson compared the album's structuring to editing a film, as compiler Alan Boyd explains, \\"I think he was right about that. The kind of editing that the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record.\\" *Stampede of the Disco Elephants: This would be the sixth album from American nu metal band Limp Bizkit. The first single \\"Lightz (City of Angels)\\" was released on October 26, 2012. After many delays, the second single for the album, \\"Ready to Go\\", featuring label mate Lil Wayne was released on April 16, 2013, to positive reviews. The band officially left their previous label Cash Money Records on October 26, 2014. In February 2016, Metal Injection reported that the band was still in the studio recording the new album. As of 2020, the album is still unreleased, with no release date set. Video games * Aliens: Colonial Marines: First announced in 2001, Aliens: Colonial Marines spent over 12 years in development hell. The original game which was announced in 2001 to be in development by Check Six Games, was cancelled. The video game rights for the Alien franchise were sold in December 2006 to Sega. Gearbox Software subsequently announced that it would take over development of Colonial Marines, intending it to be a direct follow-up to Aliens.Game Informer, March 2008, Issue 79, p. 49 The game would spend another 7 years in development, during which Gearbox's resources were also being consumed by other projects, such as Duke Nukem Forever, as well as its own franchise Borderlands, resulting in much of the game's development being outsourced to other studios. The game was released in 2013, where it was criticized for having various bugs and gameplay issues, low- quality graphics, as well as a lack of consistent continuity with the Alien film franchise. Further controversy emerged when it was found that Gearbox and Sega had presented demos of the game at conventions that had a noticeably higher graphics quality than the final product. * Beyond Good and Evil 2: An upcoming sequel to the 2003 video game, Beyond Good & Evil. The original was released in 2003, was critically praised and gained a cult following, but was considered a commercial failure. Its director said in a May 2008 interview with the French magazine that a Beyond Good & Evil sequel had been in pre- production for a year, but was yet to be approved by Ubisoft. Ubisoft officially announced a sequel in 2016. Ubisoft showed the first new trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2 during their E3 2017 conference and it was announced as a prequel to the first game. * Diablo III: Development began in 2000 by Blizzard North, and continued until the studio closed in 2005. An entirely new development began in 2006, and the game was released in 2012. * Duke Nukem Forever: The sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever, was in development hell for 14 years: from 1997 to its release date in 2011. The long development time was caused by numerous factors, including a switch from the Quake II engine to the Unreal Engine, having a relatively small development staff by modern standards (3D Realms' co-owners George Broussard and Scott Miller infamously maintained that the game would be released \\"when it's done\\"), conflicts between 3D Realms and its publisher, Take-Two Interactive, over how it had been handling the constant delays, and the eventual bankruptcy of 3D Realms. In 2009, the rights to the Duke Nukem franchise were sold to Gearbox Software, who eventually completed the game and released it in 2011.: \\"Allen Blum and those guys, they're actually now in the Gearbox Software building on the tenth floor. We brought them in; they're now connected to the Gearbox infrastructure and our central team of animators and modelers and sound engineers.\\" The game was ultimately a critical disappointment, with most of the criticism directed towards the game's clunky controls, long loading times, offensive humor, and overall aged and dated design. However, it was a commercial success. * Final Fantasy XV: Originally titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, it was announced in 2006 as a spinoff of Final Fantasy XIII exclusively for PlayStation 3. Following a long period with little news on the game, it was re-announced as the next mainline installment of the series on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One which underwent large changes in direction such as making the game a self-contained story and replacing the main heroine. The game was released worldwide on November 29, 2016, more than 10 years after it was initially announced. Additional story content was released post-launch in the form of episodic DLC. * Mother 3: A sequel to the 1994 Super Nintendo RPG Mother 2 (released as EarthBound in 1995 in North America). The game was initially intended to be released on the Super Famicom like its predecessor, starting development shortly after the latter's release, before shifting focus to the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive. Following the failure of the Disk Drive, the game was shifted to the standard Nintendo 64, before the development team's inexperience with 3D-oriented video game creation and a large series of delays led to the game being quietly cancelled in 2000. Eventually, assets from the cancelled project were collected and converted to a 2D format, and the project restarted development on the Game Boy Advance. Twelve years after its conception, Mother 3 was finally released on the Game Boy Advance in 2006, but only in Japan.

Early Life  Noga Levy-Rapoport was born on 25 November 2001 in Tel Aviv. She moved to the UK as a toddler.  Activism  On 15 February 2019, she participated in London's first climate strike march, before joining the UK Student Climate Network as a volunteer for school outreach and organising around the Green New Deal with GND UK. She helped organised London climate strikes for global strike dates on 15 March 2019 and 24 May 2019, as well as hosting and publicly announcing UKSCN's support of a Green New Deal for the UK at the London climate strike on 12 April 2019. Since February, the 17-year-old has spoken at numerous panels, events, strikes and protests around the UK. On 7 May 2019, Noga spoke at the International Maritime Organization in London to call for a limit on shipping speeds in order to reduce emissions alongside the Campaign Against Climate Change group and other activists. The speech was described as 'Greta Thunberg treatment' for the IMO, who, as a UN body, had previously come under fire for not being committed enough to reducing their emissions. In July 2019, Levy-Rapoport opened the keynote at the annual Children's Media Conference, arguing that the political balance the media had so far tried to place on children's media when producing content that covered climate change was ineffective and potentially paralysing for young people willing to take action on climate change. Described as an \\"outstanding address\\", the activist, named as one of CMC's 'Changemakers' of the year, pointedly noted that there was a \\"global call for the children to become the leaders of today\\", and this ought to start with their media. On 20 September 2019, she hosted London's global climate strike, the largest climate mobilisation in UK history, with 100,000 protesters in the capital and 350,000 attending strikes across the country. In the same month, her joint design for a climate strike placard along with ILOVEYOU agency was entered for Beazley's 'Design of the Year' competition at the Design Museum, which Levy-Rapoport and her fellow activists chose not to boycott, a decision she later explained in an article for It's Nice That. In October 2019, she was selected by the London Evening Standard as one of London's most influential people of 2019 as part of their annual Progress 1000 list. In the same month she discussed the climate crisis and politicians with Clive Lewis for Huck Magazine. The campaigner has taken on a strong spokesperson role for the youth climate movement in the UK and has been interviewed for several media outlets, local to national, as well as writing for The Guardian, It's Nice That, and the Fabian Society. Levy-Rapoport is also a spokesperson for Labour for a Green New Deal.

The original document dates from between 881 and 887 or between 896 and 899, but no longer exists. The list is found in a transcript from the 11th Century, which is now in the Hessischen Staatsarchiv Marburg. The tithe register is divided into four sections. Many placenames are duplicated and triplicated. The first part was apparently compiled between 830 und 860, and lists under 239 numbers a large number of placenames. The second part and subsequent parts were created during the abbacy of Abbott Harderat between 889 and 899 and was bound with the first part and lists 18 names, each of which ends in '-burg' 2. In the third part 13 places are listed and in the fourth 5 markets and 7 places are listed.

A small group of people, known as syndicates, started controlling any large monetary transactions including selling of land, construction of buildings, buying of material goods. These people, often connected to the ruling political party, demand a share of any large transaction happening in an area. These practices mostly happen in the construction business, but have recently spread to most sphere of life including building individual residential houses. Corrupt groups often also force builders and consumers to buy from a particular vendor, connected to the same groups and political party officials. Sometimes, this leads to supply of inferior quality materials at a premium price. The Kolkata flyover collapse has been also linked to low quality raw materials supplied by such syndicates. The Narada sting operation exposes close links of syndicates to the top party officials of AITC, showing party leaders taking large sums of money from an unknown businessman.  History  The Left-front government used to interfere with most local affairs in West Bengal during their tenure. The leaders of the Left-front parties, including the CPI(M), used to monitor local constructions and businesses. However, the top leaders kept a check on the local leaders and groups, not to be involved with any business transactions. Rather, the businesses used to officially donate to party-funds. Still, there were a few very local leaders who used to make money by charging to the businesses. A few years before AITC came to power in West Bengal in 2011, the local AITC party leaders became very powerful in their areas. The leaders started demanding a share of money for any building constructions happening in that area. Slowly, multiple groups started emerging in individual areas, connected to multiple local AITC leaders. When AITC finally won 2011 Legislative Assembly election and started their term, the whole syndicate business flourished.  The Tactics  A local leader of AITC employs a group of unemployed people to run the racket. The racket is called syndicate. Wherever a real-estate business is constructing a building, or a company wants to open up a new factory, or even a family wants to buy material goods for building a home, the syndicate appears and inquires about the activity. Then, they force the company or the family to take the raw-materials for the construction from a particular vendor that they operate, at a higher rate than the market rate. If the consumer does not agree to buy from them, then they demand large sums of money for the construction. In case the company complains to the local police, the local and top AITC party officials control the police to take any action. In addition, the local administration forces the company to bend to the demands of the syndicates. Recently, the syndicate business has grown to college admissions. Student-wing of AITC demands money to the newly admitted freshers in colleges in West Bengal. They often intimidate the students if they do not succumb to their monetary demands. Mamata Banerjee, the founder of AITC and the Chief Minister of West Bengal, has told party officials to control their rackets.

It opened on 2 March 2002. Although the rolling stock in use are replicas or restored models of cable trams, they now run with diesel motors.  History  In 1996, the Portland Cable Tram project was established with the aim of creating a tramway in the town. The basis of the proposal was that although Portland was in a region with natural tourist attractions, it lacked a significant man-made feature which would encourage tourists to stay longer in the area. The funding of such a large project initially presented a problem, as tracks would have to be laid, rolling stock acquired, and a storage shed built. However, a donation of $220,000 by the Handbury family helped the proposal gain momentum. This was followed by $500,000 from the Federal Government, $775,000 from the Victorian Government and $175,000 from the Shire of Glenelg. A further $500,000 from other sources brought the total to $2.17 million. The first year of operation proved successful, with 14,000 passengers carried. Since opening, more than 135,000 people have ridden the Portland Cable Tram.  Current operation  The Portland Cable Tram is run by a group of around 60 volunteers who undertake roles as tram drivers, conductors, administrators, maintenance workers, cleaners, gardeners, and museum display curators. The tramway's general manager is the only paid employee. The trams usually run five times a day, but only four services operate daily during winter. The route operates 364 days a year; there are no services on Christmas Day nor in the morning on Anzac Day and Good Friday. Tickets, which provide one day's unlimited use of the trams, are available from the Museum and Depot, online, or the tram's conductor. Annual tickets are also available. Passengers may board and alight the trams at any of the six stations. The Portland Cable Tram Museum and Depot is home to an 1880 horse-drawn carriage owned by Edward Henty, the first permanent European settler in the Port Phillip District (later Victoria), as well as model railway exhibits, classic cars and the largest private gemstone collection in the southern hemisphere. The gift shop sells memorabilia and refreshments are also available.  Line guide  The line is 3.7 kilometres long and journeys depart from and return to the Portland Cable Tram Museum and Depot. Beginning at the Museum and Depot, the tram heads in an westerly direction, stopping at the Powerhouse Museum, a small institution showcasing motor vehicles. A balloon loop then sends the tram back towards the Museum and Depot station after some street running. Passing through Henty Park, the next stop is the Botanic Gardens after which the line turns north and runs close to the Portland harbour along the Foreshore. A stop at the Portland Maritime Discovery Centre is followed by a climb up the headland to the Portland Bay Holiday Park, where another station is located. After passing several homes, the line turns east to terminate at the World War II Memorial Lookout, which also served as a water tower. At this point, the tram sets are turned on a triangle for the return trip back to the Portland Cable Tram Museum and Depot, making the ride 7.4 kilometres and around one hour in length.  Rolling stock  Saloon Car No. 95 There is a variety of rolling stock currently in use on the tramway. The two grip cars operated by Portland Cable Trams are copies of Melbourne cable trams which ran from 1885 to 1940, constructed to the specifications of that period. They were built from scratch under the auspices of Keith McMillan, and are exact replicas, apart from the diesel engines that they use in place of the cable system. That method of propulsion was chosen because it would be virtually impossible to build the complicated underground cable network which originally pulled cable trams along. The two saloon cars in service at Portland did run on the Melbourne system during its heyday. After the electrification of the network, the outdated cable tram cars were sold off. Saloon Car No. 95 initially entered service in November 1886 and was used on the Victoria Street route, running via Collins Street. The Portland Cable Tram organisation salvaged that car from Newton Williams in Swan Hill and restored it to service in February 2002. Saloon Car No. 171 was originally built in 1886 and used on the Clifton Hill line until 1928, when it was sold and transported to Mount Macedon. The car was bought by Daryl and Julie Hawksworth in 1974, and in 1980, it was transported to the town of Blampied, Victoria, for restoration. No. 171 is on permanent loan to Portland Cable Trams from the Hawksworths, who had restored it to commemorate the 100th anniversary of cable trams commencing operation in Melbourne. Since its repair in 1985, the saloon car has operated at Lake Goldsmith, Bendigo, Melbourne and Kilmore in Victoria, as well as Wollongong and Loftus in New South Wales.

The show served as the year-end finale for CMLL before Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue, closed down for the winter for renovations and to host Circo Atayde. The shows replaced the regular Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows held by CMLL since the mid-1930s. In the main event of the show El Solar II defeated Belceb√∫ in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", forcing Belceb√∫ to remove his devil inspired mask and reveal that his name was Juan Manuel Linares. In the semi-main event of the six-match show, El Dandy defeated Gran Cochisse, which meant that Cochisse had all his hair shaved off afterwards. The four remaining matches included a tag team match and three Best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team matches. In addition to being EMLL's year end show, thee show was also a benefit show for victims of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that happened on September 19, 1985, that had caused the death of over 5,000 people and cased major damage to Mexico City , including structural damage to Arena M√©xico. The earthquake had also forced the cancellation of the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show. Production =Background= For decades Arena M√©xico, the main venue of the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting Circo Atayde occupy the space over the holidays. As a result, CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". =Storylines= The 1985 Juicio Final show featured six professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform.

The Lodian culture appears mainly in areas south of the territory of the Yarmukian culture, in the Shfela and the beginning of the Israeli coastal plain, the Judaean Mountains and in the desert regions around the Dead Sea and south of it. The Lodian culture is defined by its distinctive pottery. It was first identified by John Garstang during his excavations of the eponymous Layer IX at Jericho. Thomas Levy later coined the term Lodian, shifting the type site to that of Lod, first excavated by Jacob Kaplan in the 1950s. The relationship between the Lodian culture and the two other Southern Levantine Pottery Neolithic cultures, the Yarmoukian and the Wadi Raba culture, has been debated for many years. Levy argued that it was a short-lived but distinct tradition that emerged after the Yarmoukian and before the Wadi Raba.  Settlements  Most known settlements associated with the Lodian culture were small and ephemeral. From the few sites remains of architecture have been found, it appears the inhabitants lived in circular, semi-subterranean rounded structures, 2-3 meters in diameter, made from mudbrick. Next to the structures were many pits dug by these inhabitants. They kept domestic animals, including sheep, goats, cattle and pigs, and also fished and hunted wild gazelle. It is assumed that they also grew the typical Neolithic crops, e.g. cereals and legumes, but no archaeobotanical evidence has been recovered from Lodian sites to confirm this. Sites with Lodian material include Jericho, Lod, Tel Megiddo, Ghrubba, Teluliot Batashi, Tel Lachish, Tel Ali, Abu Zurayq, Wadi Shueib, Dhra‚Ä≤, Khirbet ed-Dharih, Nizzanim, and En Esur. Very few burials have been found at Lodian sites. The inhabitants may have disposed of their dead in other ways, or used dedicated cemeteries away from settlements, as the later Wadi Raba culture was known to do.  Tools  Lodian pottery is identical in shape to the Yarmukian pottery but different in decoration. The typical Lodian pottery vessels are painted and burnished, with distinctive geometric motifs and vessel forms. Its lithic industry is dominated by flake tools, including several characteristic types of arrowheads (Haparsa, Nizzanim, and Herzlia points) and sickle blades. Bipolar cores, common in preceding cultures, disappeared during the Lodian. Figurines and other ritual objects are notably rare in Lodian assemblages, unlike the Yarmoukian. The flint tools area also similar to those of the Yarmukian. One distinctive type of flint tool that is unique to the Lodian culture is a rectangular sickle, shaped with pressure flaking.

Constructed in 1909 as Machigonne, a yacht for William L. Douglas, the vessel was purchased by the United States Navy in 1917 for use as a patrol ship on the United States East Coast during World War I and named USS Machigonne (SP-507). Following the end of the war, Machigonne was demobilised and returned to service as a yacht. At the onset of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy sought capable vessels for port defence, and finding few in Canadian hands, went south to American ports and purchased suitable ships there. Machigonne was discovered and acquired. However, a lack of familiarity with Machigonnes propulsion system led to it being burnt out before entering service. Though commissioned as HMCS Grizzly, the armed yacht was not given the modifications that other Canadian armed yachts were and spent the majority of the war anchored in the passages into the harbour at Prince Rupert, British Columbia as a guard ship. By June 1944, Grizzly was no longer considered safe and was sold for scrap to the Capital Iron and Metal Company of Victoria, British Columbia in December. Description As a yacht, Machigonne was measured at , long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship was propelled by a propeller powered by vertical triple expansion steam engine, giving the vessel a maximum speed of . In American naval service, Machigonne was armed with three 3-pounder guns and had a complement of 31 personnel. As a Canadian armed yacht, Grizzly had a displacement of and was long with a beam of and a draught of . The vessel was equipped with diesel engines and had a maximum speed of . The ship was initially armed with one 6-pounder gun and had a complement of 5 officers and 35 ratings. Service history =As Machigonne= Machigonne was a steel sailing yacht constructed in 1909 by the Consolidated Shipbuilding Corporation of New York City, New York. The yacht had been ordered for William L. Douglas, a shoe manufacture who later became mayor of Boston and governor of Massachusetts. During World War I, the vessel was taken up by the United States Navy for $55,000 and given the identification number SP-507 on 15 May 1917. The ship was armed with three 3-pounder guns, two machine guns and one Y-gun depth charge projector. USS Machigonne was commissioned on 9 July 1917 and employed on patrol duties along the United States East Coast. Machigonne was taken out of United States Navy service and sold for commercial use on 20 June 1919. The engines were later replaced with German submarine-type Foos diesel engines. =As Grizzly= To augment the local sea defences of ports, the Royal Canadian Navy sought large, steel-hulled yachts to requisition. However, a significant lack of capable vessels were owned by Canadians. Canada turned to its southern neighbour for suitable ships, finding several that met the navy's requirements. However, US neutrality laws prevented their sale to belligerents in the war. In order to circumvent these laws, the Royal Canadian Navy requisitioned the yachts of prominent Canadian yachtsmen and then sent them to the US to purchase the yachts that had been identified by the navy without the US government knowing they were working for the navy. The money to acquire the vessels was provided by the Canadian government through bank loans. After being acquired, Irving Keenleyside, an executive with Burrard Dry Dock Company who had been selected by the RCN to go to the US to acquire yachts, travelled to Long Beach, California to pick up Machigonne. Either shortly before or after arrival at Esquimalt, British Columbia the unfamiliarity with the engine design by Canadian personnel led to them being burnt out due to lubrication issues. Though commissioned as Grizzly, the vessel never saw service as a powered yacht. Grizzly was primarily used as an anchored harbour/channel guard ship and as an examination vessel on the West Coast. The yacht never received the armaments and asdic the other conversions did and was anchored at the passages into Prince Rupert, British Columbia. At Prince Rupert, Grizzly was normally anchored between British Columbia and mainland in the northern channel entering the port. The vessel was equipped with two Lewis machine guns and supported by heavier coastal artillery. Every six months, the yacht was towed into Prince Rupert and underwent an overhaul. The vessel was crewed by 14‚Äì15 naval personnel with up to three officers. In mid-1942, the north passage was closed using a log boom and Grizzly was towed to the south passage and remained as guard ship there until June 1944. Grizzly was taken to Victoria, British Columbia in early 1944 to undergo an assessment. On 17 June 1944, Grizzly was paid off as unsafe due to deteriorating plating. The ship was sold in December 1944 to Capital Iron and Metal Company and broken up for scrap at Victoria beginning on 25 March 1945. The ship's wheel was kept as a memorial in British Columbia until at least 1980.

Although glaciers seem motionless to the observer they are in constant motion and the terminus is always either advancing or retreating. The accumulation zone is found at the highest altitude of the glacier, where accumulation of material is greater than ablation. On a glacier, the accumulation zone is the area above the firn line, where snowfall accumulates and exceeds the losses from ablation, (melting, evaporation, and sublimation). The annual equilibrium line separates the accumulation and ablation zone annually. The accumulation zone is also defined as the part of a glacier's surface, usually at higher elevations, on which there is net accumulation of snow, which subsequently turns into firn and then glacier ice. Part of the glacier where snow builds up and turns to ice moves outward from there. The glacier head is the highest upslope edge of an alpine glacier or the upslope end of the zone of accumulation. The head of the glacier comes up against a steep bedrock cliff called a cirque headwall Cross section of a cirque glacier showing the bergschrund Movement and ice loss The head can come away from the cirque in a downslope movement which can create a large crevasse called a bergschrund. This crevasse can be a major obstacle for mountaineers. The existence of a bergschrund is evidence that ice mass has pulled away from the cirque. A shrinking glacier thins faster near the terminus than near the head, which explains why glaciers retreat up-valley and the glacier head stays in place The speed of erosion or accumulation is partly dependent on a shape factor which is the ratio of the change in thickness at the glacier head to the change in the thickness at the terminus.

The type site of the Yarmukian culture, it is notable for the discovery of a significant number of artistic objects, as well as some of the earliest pottery in the Southern Levant. The first Yarmukian settlement was unearthed at Megiddo during the 1930s, but was not identified as a distinct Neolithic culture at the time. At Sha'ar HaGolan, in 1949, professor Moshe Stekelis first identified the Yarmukian culture, a Pottery Neolithic culture that inhabited parts of Israel and Jordan.Garfinkel Y. 1993. The site, dated to ca. 6400‚Äì6000 BC (calibrated), is located in the central Jordan Valley, on the northern bank of the Yarmouk River. Its size is around 20 hectares, making it one of the largest settlements in the world at that time. Although other Yarmukian sites have been identified since, Sha'ar HaGolan is the largest, probably indicating its role as the Yarmukian center.Garfinkel, Y. 1999. The site was excavated by two teams from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem: one led by Stekelis (1949‚Äì1952), and the other by Yosef Garfinkel (1989‚Äì90, 1996‚Äì2004). While during the earlier excavations no architecture was found, the second expedition uncovered large courtyard houses, ranging between 250 and 700 m¬≤ in area. The courtyard house makes its first appearance at Sha'ar HaGolan, giving the site a special significance in architectural history. This is an architectural concept still found among traditional Mediterranean societies. Monumental construction on this scale is unknown elsewhere during this period. The houses consist of a central courtyard surrounded by several small rooms. The houses were separated by streets, which constitute evidence of advanced community planning. The dig uncovered a central street about 3 m wide, paved with pebbles set in mud, and a narrow winding alley 1 m wide. These are the earliest streets discovered in Israel and among the earliest streets built by man. A 4.15 m well dug to the local water table indicates a knowledge of hydraulics. Exotic objects discovered during the excavations include sea shells from the Mediterranean, polished stone vessels made of alabaster (or marble), and blades made from obsidian from Turkey. The presence of obsidian points to trade connections extending over 700 km. Pottery Mother goddess clay figurine, Sha'ar HaGolan The greatest technological innovation of the Sha'ar HaGolan Neolithic was the manufacture of pottery. This industry, which appears here for the first time in Israel, gives this cultural stage its name of Pottery Neolithic. The pottery vessels are in a variety of shapes and sizes and were put to various domestic uses. At the site of 'Ain Ghazal, located along the banks of the Zarqa River near Amman, Jordan, the early Pottery Neolithic period is dated from 6,400 to 5,000 BC.The Neolithic Period 10.200-5000 BC (Jordan) doa.gov.jo - Jordan Department of Antiquities File:Early Pottery Vessels, Yarmukian Culture.jpgEarly Pottery Vessels, Yarmukian Culture Image:Yarmukian Culture -Sha'ar HaGolan, pottery.jpgSha'ar HaGolan, pottery Image:Yarmukian Culture -Sha'ar HaGolan, zoomorphic figurine.jpgSha'ar HaGolan, zoomorphic figurine File:Yarmukian Culture -Sha'ar HaGolan, clay figurine.jpgSha'ar HaGolan, clay figurine Art About 300 art objects were found at Sha'ar HaGolan, making it the main center of prehistoric art in Israel and one of the most important in the world. One of the houses yielded approximately 70 figurines made of stone or fired clay. No other single building of the Neolithic period has yielded that many prehistoric figurines. Among the outstanding art objects from Sha'ar HaGolan are figurines in human form made of fired clay or carved on pebbles. The overwhelming majority are female images, interpreted as representing a goddess. The clay figurines are extravagant in their detail, giving them a surrealistic appearance, while the pebble figurines are minimalist and abstract in form. The members of Kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan have built a museum that exhibits the finds from the nearby site. Because of the unique artistic quality of the figurines from Sha'ar Hagolan, both the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Louvre Museum in Paris have mounted ten-year exhibits of objects from the site. In Israel, figurines are exhibited at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

The species overwinters as a larva. Life cycle =Larva= right right Larvae live on a variety of ferns feeding on the sporangia, or the lower surface of the frond, under the cover of sporangia spun in an irregular pile. The feeding signs of the similar fern-feeding moth, P. verhuella form a loose portable case out of spun sporangia and looks like misplaced sorus. The feeding causes browning of the upper frond. Fully grown, the larvae are c. 4‚Äì5 mm long with a pale-brown head and a pale-brown posterial margin, which has a split in the middle. The pale- brown head, translucent prothoracic plate and pale-brown tail distinguish P. filicivora from the similar larvae of P. verhuella, which has a black head and black prothoracic plate.

Specimens from the same locality, which had been collected earlier, were later found dating back to 1909. The first published record from elsewhere is from Bournemouth, England, in 1940, although it is possible it was found in c. 1856 by a Mr Drane at Caerphilly, Wales. He found larvae on wall-rue (Asplenium ruta-muraria), which at the time was identified as P. verhuella, but is much more likely to be P. filicivora. Since 1940 it as be found in mainly coastal locations in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. There is a related species in Japan and it is possible that the moth was imported from Asia on ferns.

Personal life Hamblin was the daughter of actor William Blanchard and the half-sister of playwright E. L. Blanchard. She married the actor Thomas S. Hamblin, whom she divorced in 1834. She later married her colleague, James Charles. She was the mother to actor Thomas (William Henry) Hamblin Jr. and Elizabeth ‚ÄúBetsey‚Äù Hamblin. Career Hamblin had a successful acting career in New York from the 1820s to 1840s. She made her debut at the Haymarket Theatre in London in 1818 and debuted in the United States at the Park Theatre in 1825. She had a long-time involvement with the Bowery Theatre, where she was one of the main attractions. Her career at the Bowery ended in 1832, and in 1834 she divorced her first husband and manager of the Bowery, Thomas Hamblin. She continued her involvement with other theatres, mainly in New York. Hamblin also worked as a theatre manager and was the first woman in the United States to have several duties at different theatres. From 1836-37 she managed the Richmond Hill Theatre in New York (with a temporary break in 1836 during Annette Nelson‚Äôs time as director), and at one point was seen as a competitor to her former husband. Hamblin focused on a narrow range of high- culture theatre art, including ballet. She also managed the Olympic Theatre in 1838, and the musical stages of Tivoli Garden and Colonnade Garden in 1840. During the 1840s she toured the American South and was involved with many theatres. She died in New Orleans in 1849.

Constructed in 1915 as the yacht Wenowah, with the US entry into World War I, the vessel was taken into United States Navy service as USS Wenonah (SP-165) as a patrol ship. The vessel escorted convoys between the United States and Europe and between Gibraltar and Bizerte, Tunis and Genoa, Italy. After the war, Wenonah was loaned to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for three and a half years before being sold to private interests in 1928. In private ownership, the vessel was renamed at least twice, including Stranger and Blue Water. With the onset of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy sought vessels capable of patrol duties. However, a lack of Canadian ships led them to acquiring vessels from their southern neighbour. Blue Water was acquired in 1940 for service on the British Columbia coast and used a patrol vessel. Following the war, the ship was sold again to commercial ownership and renamed Gulfstream. Gulfstream was wrecked off Powell River, British Columbia on 11 October 1947. Description Wenonah measured , long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The ship was propelled by one shaft powered by a vertical triple expansion steam engine giving the ship a maximum speed of . In United States Navy service the ship had a complement of 65 personnel and was armed with two 3\\"/50 caliber guns. In Canadian service, the vessel measured , long with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a maximum speed of and was armed with one QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun and one 2-pounder gun. Wolf had a complement of 5 officers and 38 ratings. Service history =As Wenonah= Wenonah was a yacht constructed in 1915 by George Lawley & Sons at their yard in Neponset, Massachusetts. With the US entry into World War I, the United States Navy (USN) sought out ships to augment its patrol service and acquired Wenonah from Walter G. Ladd. Wenonah was taken up as a patrol ship by the USN on 8 June 1917 and given the hull identification number SP-165.Silverstone has the date at 8 August. The vessel was commissioned on 22 October. Wenonah departed Newport, Rhode Island with five other patrol ships and a tender, towing submarine chasers to Gibraltar via Bermuda and the Azores. The convoy arrived on 25 December and beginning on 15 January 1918 Wenonah was used to escort convoys between Gibraltar and Bizerte, Tunisia. In July, Wenonah escorted a convoy to Genoa, Italy. During this mission, one of the vessels she was escorting, was torpedoed on 23 July. Wenonah recovered the survivors after dropping one depth charge on a suspected contact. The following day, 24 July, was torpedoed. Once again Wenonah dropped a depth charge, but this time it failed to detonate and the patrol ship turned to rescue work, recovering 38 of Rutherglens crew. During the rest of the convoy's voyage Wenonah dropped several more depth charges and fired a 3-inch shell at suspected contacts, but no further engagement with the enemy was had before the end of the journey. Wenonah returned to Gibraltar‚ÄìBizerte convoys until the end of the war in November. Wenowah returned to the US in December 1918 and remained in naval service until 12 April 1919. The vessel was then transferred to the Department of Commerce's Coast and Geodetic Survey and given the hull number PY-11. Wenonah spent three and a half years with the unit before transferring back to the USN in October 1922, joining the 13th Naval District on the West Coast and reclassified as a converted yacht. Wenonah remained in USN service from November 1922 to June 1928 when the yacht was stricken from the Navy List. The vessel was sold on 15 May 1929 to H. W. Goodall of Santa Barbara, California for $7,000 and renamed Stranger. Goodall sold Stranger to Mrs. Marian Huntington of San Francisco during the Great Depression. =As Wolf= To augment the local sea defences of coastal ports, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) sought large, steel-hulled yachts to requisition. However, a significant lack of capable vessels were owned by Canadians. Canada turned to its southern neighbour for suitable ships, finding several that met the navy's requirements. However, US neutrality laws prevented their sale to belligerents in the war. In order to circumvent these laws, the RCN requisitioned the yachts of prominent Canadian yachtsmen and then sent them to the US to purchase the yachts that had been identified by the navy without the US government knowing they were working for the navy. The money to acquire the vessels was provided by the Canadian government through bank loans. While acquiring the yacht Breezin Thru for Clarence Wallace, Irving Keenleyside, an executive with the Burrard Dry Dock Company, spotted another yacht that fit the RCN's requirements. The yacht, Blue Water, was deemed acceptable after an investigation and Keenleyside sought the government's permission to purchase the vessel. He gave the name of his partner, E. A. Riddell, who was unaware of the program at the time of the call. The RCN then requisitioned Riddell's yacht upon approval in order to keep the real source of the funds secret. Conversion to an armed yacht involved removing most of the luxurious finery and installing naval hardware. The ship was armed with a 12-pounder gun, depth charges and machine guns. The ship was later given a 1-inch anti-aircraft gun for training purposes. The ship was commissioned into the RCN on 2 October 1940. Wolf was used to patrol the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the mouth of the Fraser River after entering service. The ship remained with the Esquimalt Force for the entire war, though as the war progressed, Wolf was used for training and then after September 1943, as an examination vessel. The yacht was paid off on 16 May 1945 and by August the ship was laid up for sale. The ship was purchased by Gulf Lines as a coastal ferry in 1946. Renamed Gulfstream the ferry was wrecked off Powell River, British Columbia on 11 October 1947.

He has worked with Cecil Taylor, Peter Br√∂tzmann, Marshall Allen, John Tchicai, Elliott Sharp, Fred Frith, and Jim O'Rourke. Biography Smith spent his childhood in eastern Washington but moved to Oakland in the mid-1980s. He took up bass in his late teens, inspired by the Minutemen's Mike Watt. His love of Minutemen got him to explore other bands on the SST Records label which led to his discovery of Henry Kaiser, Elliott Sharp and Saccharine Trust. Smith credited Saccharine Trust's improvised live album Worldbroken with altering his views on punk rock, jazz, and free-form jamming. Eventually Damon was fortunate enough to meet Kaiser and the two have collaborated for over twenty years including more than ten recordings together. Initially an electric bass player due to his love of Minutemen and Watt's followup band fIREHOSE, Smith switched to double bass and began focusing on improvisation inspired by Peter Kowald and his album Duos:Europa Smith studied with Bill Douglas, Lisle Ellis, Kristin Zerneg, and Bertram Turetsky. In 2001, Smith launched his own record label called Balance Point Acoustics. More recently, Smith has played with Weasel Walter in his Weasel Walter Quartet and in Plane Crash which also includes Henry Kaiser. The latter expanded to become Astral Plane Crash with the inclusion of Vinny Golia and Bob Moses. Smith has also collaborated with Werner Herzog on soundtracks to his documentary films Grizzly Man and Encounters at the End of the World.

steep slopes and erosive rainfall has led to excessive soil erosion. Nutrients and organic matter were lost and soil depth was reduced. Hence, soil erosion is an important problem, which results in low crop yields and biomass production. Given the strong degradation and thanks to the hard labour of many people in the villages, soil conservation is carried out on a large scale since the 1980s and especially 1980s; this has curbed rates of soil loss. Measures include the construction of infiltration trenches, stone bunds, check dams, small reservoirs such as La'ilay Wuqro and May Azaboy as well as a major biological measure: exclosures in order to allow forest regeneration. On the other hand, it remains difficult to convince farmers to carry out measures within the farmland (in situ soil management), such as bed and furrows or zero grazing, as there is a fear for loss of income from the land.

The existence of such movements can only be explained by the presence, in these territories, of strong independence or secessionist claims.  Terminology  The terms anti-independence and loyalty are generally synonymous, the second term being used mostly in New Caledonia. The separatist movements generally describe their opponents as neo-colonialists, whereas it is not uncommon for anti- independenceists to still defend the theses autonomists, regionalist or federalists. In the provinces of the Federal States which have secessionist movements, such as Quebec in Canada, opponents of independence are called \\" federalists\\" in the sense that they defend the maintenance of the federal constitution, and that they are autonomists (for strengthening powers at the local level to the detriment of the federal level ) or not. In a unitary state, anti-independence movements, also called republicans or monarchists depending on the nature of the central state, can be distinguished between centralism centralist (also called Jacobins in France or Unionists in United Kingdom, they fight to give none or very little specific political, economic or cultural territory), \\"departmental\\" (movement especially present in the French overseas collectivity of Mayotte, aiming to make this territory a Department and thus lose some of its autonomy) or autonomists. Anti- independence can thus include various political ideologies, and can be seen as a form of nationalism defending the unity of an already existing nation, considered synonymous with State sovereign strong and \\"human group constituting a political community, established on a defined territory (...) and personified by a sovereign authority\\" ( Le Petit Robert). Independence is also a nationalism but under its cultural and / or ethnic acceptance, with a nation yet to be built and whose ultimate outcome must be political independence, and seen as a \\"group of people living on a common territory, conscious of its unity (historical, cultural, etc.) and constituting a political entity / Dictionary of the French language. \\"(Dictionary of the French language). However, in a wider acceptance, it is an opposition to any form of political fragmentation of the world and therefore to nationalism in all its forms, and is found in particular in globalism. Anti-independence movements can be defended in turn, depending on the local political context, national parties that can go from the extreme right to the far left through all possible political trends.

The show served as the year-end finale for CMLL before Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue, closed down for the winter for renovations and to host Circo Atayde. The shows replaced the regular Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows held by CMLL since the mid-1930s. The main event of the 1984 year-end show featured a traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where both M√°scara A√±o 2000 and Gran Coloso put their mask on the line in the match. M√°scara A√±o 2000 won two falls to one, forcing Gran Coloso to remove his mask and state his name; Jose Luis Gazca. In the semi-main event, the team of Gran Cochisse defeated Mocho Cota defeated, leading to Mocho Cota having all his hair shaved off afterwards. The fourth match, a tag team match with Cien Caras and Villano III facing El Fara√≥n & Perro Aguayo , ended in a disqualification due to Fara√≥n and Aguayo taking Villano III's mask.

As a result, CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". =Storylines= The 1984 Juicio Final show featured six professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds.

Administrative and municipal status  Municipally, Shaami-Yurt is incorporated as Shaami-Yurtovskoye rural settlement. It is the administrative center of the municipality and is the only settlement included in it.  Geography  Map of Achkhoy-Martanovsky District with Shami-Yurt highlighted Shaami-Yurt is located between the Fortanga and Shalazha rivers, near to the confluence with the Assa River. It is located north-east of the town of Achkhoy-Martan and south-west of the city of Grozny. The Caucasus highway runs to the north of the village. The nearest settlements to Shaami- Yurt are Davydenko and Samashki in the north-west, Zakan-Yurt in the north- east, Khambi-Irze and Kulary in the east, Gekhi and Valerik in the south-east, and Katyr-Yurt in the south-west.  History  In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Shama-Yurt was renamed to Zelyonaya Roshcha (roughly translates as Green Grove), and settled by people from other ethnic groups. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Novoselsky District of Grozny Oblast. In 1957, when the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old name, Shaami-Yurt.  Shaami-Yurt in the Chechen Wars  During the First Chechen War, Shaami-Yurt and its environs were known mainly as locations for militants. So in early 1995, front-line and army aviation launched a series of missile-bombing attacks at their places of concentration in the villages of Starye Atagi, Novye Atagi, Shaami-Yurt, Shali and Mesker-Yurt. In the summer of 1999, during the period of the Khasavyurt Accord, a group of people in Shaami-Yurt held Samara journalist Viktor Petrov and head of the regional branch of the \\"Congress of Soviet Mothers\\" Svetlana Kuzmin, as hostages. After the escape of Viktor Petrov and the release of Svetlana Kuzmina, some participants in their abduction were arrested in Shaami-Yurt. In the fall of 1999, during the Second Chechen War, the village was bombarded by federal troops under the command of Vladimir Shamanov, which led to civilian casualties and started proceedings in international courts. The applicants, including the inhabitants of the village of Shaami-Yurt, represented the Human Rights Organization \\"Memorial\\". At the end of 2000, Vladimir Shamanov tried to claim that the military operation in Shaami-Yurt had to be carried out because the militants turned a number of settlements, including Shaami-Yurt, into strongholds. Then, at the beginning of 2000, according to Sergey Yastrzhembsky, active hostilities took place in Shaami-Yurt. At the same time, news agencies reported that the federal forces opened fire on the militants in the area of the settlements of Katyr-Yurt and Shaami-Yurt, located to the south-west of the Chechen capital, Grozny. According to the Human Rights Organization \\"Memorial\\", in February 2000, at the command of the federal forces, deliberately within the framework of the developed military operation, a false ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù for the Chechen armed detachments to leave Grozny was opened. This \\"corridor\\", leading to minefields and ambushes, opened up the way for militants to a number of villages, including the notorious Katyr-Yurt, which had already been declared a \\"security zone\\" by the federal authorities. As a result, a number of villages - Alkhan-Kala, Katyr-Yurt, Shaami-Yurt, and Zakan-Yurt - when Chechen troops passed through them, and even after they left these settlements, underwent extremely strong artillery and missile-bombing attacks. Subsequently, the bombing of these settlements, among which was Shaami-Yurt, led to terrible damage. There were numerous casualties among the civilian population. The event later became known as the Katyr-Yurt Massacre, where the worst of the attacks on the villages happened. In 2002-2004, Shaami-Yurt and its environs were characterized by local fighting , attempts to undermine the village administration building, shelling, the bombing of armored personnel carriers, killings of federal forces, bombings of law enforcement vehicles, the discovery of hiding places with explosives and weapons, shelling of columns with humanitarian aid, the detention of abducted persons, and the creation of extremist literature.  Population  * 1990 Census: 2,814 * 2002 Census: 3,202 * 2010 Census: 4,018 * 2019 estimate: 4,841 According to the results of the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Achkhoy-Martan (4,014 or 99.9%) were ethnic Chechens, with 4 people (0.1%) coming from other ethnic backgrounds.  Infrastructure  Shaami-Yurt hosts one mosque, which was restored in 2007 at the request of the residents of the village.  Education  In 2007, the grand opening of the renovated secondary school of the village of Shaami-Yurt took place, in which the President of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov took part. Also, a separate building with 300 places for elementary grade students was built on the territory of the school. Overall, Shaami-Yurt school is able to accept 800 students.  Culture  Since 2009, as part of the presidential program to revive and preserve the customs and traditions of the Chechen people, the Ministry of Culture of the Chechen Republic has been conducting events throughout the republic. For example, in Shaami-Yurt, theatrical performances dedicated to the onset of spring, ‚Äú–î—É—å—Ö—Ö–∞—Ä–∞ –≥–æ—Ç–∞ —è–∫—Ö–∞—Ä\\", which roughly translates as \\"Feast of the First Furrow\\".  Sport  In the village of Shaami-Yurt, horse racing is held, which attracts several thousand spectators from all regions of the republic. According to Novaya Gazeta, on March 26, 2007, a sports center was opened in the village in which the head of the administration, Said-Magomed Bagaev, taught children and adolescents about the basics of Jujitsu.

During Roman occupation of Portugal it was part of the province of Lusitania, situated a few kilometers to the southwest of Civitas Ebora Liberalitas Julia, the modern-day Evora. It was next to the Roman road to Salacia (present-day Alc√°cer do Sal) and only five kilometers from the Roman road to Pax Julia, the modern-day Beja. Excavations indicate that it was in use between the mid-first century CE and the end of the fourth century and that, at least in the third century, it belonged to a family of senatorial rank. The Villa, which was primarily used for farming, was classified as a Site of Public Interest in 2012. Part of the site was excavated between 1985 and 1996 but ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has identified further large areas to the south and west that remain to be excavated. The area excavated so far consists of a large thermal bath with separate facilities for men and women, with hot and cold water, together with the furnaces and heating systems and a large water reservoir. Archaeologists believe that the baths were constructed in three phases. Three main baths have been identified, the largest being 24.5 meters long and about 4.6 meters wide. Excavations found numerous fragments of terra sigillata or ancient Roman pottery as well as of amphorae. Around 876 fragments of sigillata were discovered. Of those whose origins could be identified, the main source was La Rioja in Spain. Other pottery came from Arezzo in Italy and from La Graufesenque in southern France. There were also many fragments of African red slip ware from unidentified locations in northern Africa. Almost all of the amphorae found had contained fish products and had probably been mainly used for products from the Sado River estuary, such as those produced at Creiro. Fragments of only one or two amphorae that had contained wine or olive oil have been found, suggesting that the villa cultivated its own vines and olive trees.

This usually led to , a fight between the visitor and a member of the school, usually its head or a fighter chosen for the challenge, where the superiority of their respective fighting styles would be tested. The losing side would also lose its martial prestige and in many cases, its apprentices would abandon it for the winner's school. History Since ancient times, dojoyaburi was an established way for Japanese martial arts organizations to gain popularity and students. It was practiced by schools of kenjutsu, jujutsu, and other styles and it was sometimes associated with musha shugyo and the samurai lifestyle. Its usage fell with the prohibition of taryujiai, which limited martial arts competitions to the bounds of every school, but it blossomed again when the ban was lifted during the Edo period. Modern examples exist as well. In the 19th century, the Kodokan school of judo was particularly known for its intense dojoyaburi activity, caused by the opposition of other jujutsu styles. During the 1950s, karate master Teruo Hayashi also was infamous for performing dojoyaburi among the schools of Okinawa. The custom gained controversy in 1970 when a man died in a dojo storm performed by Count Dante and his students on the rival Green Dragon Society's Black Cobra Hall. Dante was ultimately acquitted.

Their relationship with other vascular plants is unclear. They have been treated as the separate class Barinophytopsida, the order Barinophytales of uncertain class and as a family or clade Barinophytaceae within the zosterophylls. They have also been considered to be possible lycopodiopsids. Description Barinophyton is the type genus of the group; Protobarinophyton is similar. They were vascular plants with an exarch protostele. Plants consisted of alternatively arranged branches, apparently without leaves or enations, with their sporangia arranged in two rows on one-sided spike-like structures that developed on side shoots. Each sporangium was born on a curved bract-like appendage (a \\"sporangiferous appendage\\") and contained several thousand microspores, about 30‚Äì40 ¬µm in diameter and about 30 megaspores, 410‚Äì560 ¬µm in diameter, so that the plants were heterosporous. A similar pattern of spore sizes and numbers has been found in the progymnosperm Archaeopteris. Dibracophyton has been tentatively assigned to this group. It does have some outgrowths on the lower parts of the stems (axes), which raises the possibility that more fossil material might show that other barinophytes did not have naked stems. Taxonomy =Phylogeny= Two very different cladograms have been produced showing the evolutionary relationships of taxa assigned to the barinophytes. Kenrick and Crane in 1997 placed two species of Barinophyton and the genus Protobarinophyton in the Barinophytaceae in their Sawdoniales, well nested within the zosterophylls. A summary cladogram produced by Crane et al. in 2004, shows Barinophyton and Protobarinophyton as 'core' zosterophylls. Taylor et al. in 2009 did not present a cladogram, but considered the barinophytes to be possible lycopsids rather than zosterophylls. By contrast, Hao and Xue in 2013 do not even place Dibracophyton, which they consider to be a possible barinophyte, within the lycopodiopsids, instead putting it between this group and the euphyllophytes. =Genera= Genera that are placed, or tentatively placed, in the barinophytes (with the group treated at different ranks) include: *Barinophyton *Bracteophyton *Dibracophyton *Krithodeophyton *Protobarinophyton References Bibliography * Category:Prehistoric plant taxa Category:Paleozoic plants ","title":"Barinophyte"},{"id":"62176000","text":"Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Foundation Trust is an NHS foundation trust which provides physical health, mental health and learning disability services throughout Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.

On December 25, 1876, she married John Alexander Matthews. Together they had 9 children. The Matthews and Reynolds families lived on the Texas frontier in West Texas. They were both pioneer families whose lives were well entangled together. This period of the frontier was when settlers were near nomadic as the Indians. Finding material to build homes was difficult. Her family moved often, frequently living near the Matthews family. After she had married John, more Reynolds married into the Matthews family. Matthews was the third generation of cattle ranchers. She wrote in her book all of the trails of her life as a pioneer. Also, she and John had 9 children. Matthews lived on cattle ranches as a child and in her married life. Ranches were sometimes quite isolated. Her education was quite sporadic due to this. Later in life, Matthews wrote a book about the two families: the Reynolds and the Matthews. There had been several marriages between the two families, including hers. They had built quite a community in this part of Texas. The book was originally intended for children, but the information therein ended up being valuable enough that it is now part of the history of the Texas frontier.

The smaller northern part is located in the Frankfurt district of Flughafen,the larger southern part on the district R√ºsselsheim am Main. Before the runway went into operation in 1984, the plans met with considerable protest and became one of the most important points of reference for the German environmental movement of the 1970s and 1980s. History =Planning= In 1962, the operating company of Frankfurt Rhein- Main Airport, Frankfurt Airport/Main AG, decided to design a new runway in addition to a new reception terminal. A drastic increase in air traffic had pushed both the old station buildings and the parallel railway system, which still exists to this day, to the limits of resilience. The Rhine-Main region was in a steady economic upswing, thanks in no small part to the airport as a European air hub. But the airport area was surrounded exclusively by forest, including Bannwald. In addition, there was another problem: in the north, the Bundesautobahn 3 runs in an east-west direction, in the east the Bundesautobahn 5 runs in a north-south direction, in the west there is also an above-ground main stream line and to the south, the American Rhein-Main Air Base also made an uncomplicated expansion impossible. Only in the southwest corner of the site was there the possibility of a new runway in a north-south direction. This meant, on the one hand, an major logging operation and on the other hand the extension of the airport area to a municipal area no longer belonging to the urban area. On 28 December 1965, Flughafen AG applied for a permit for the construction of the \\"Runway 18 West\\". In May 1966, the Hessian Landtag decided to build a new 4000-metre-long runway in a north-south direction. In view of the political approval, Flughafen Frankfurt/Main AG (FAG) decided in November 1967 to build the new project, which cost DM 78 million. At a time of increasing environmental awareness, more and more citizens were sceptical about this expansion. Following the planning approval decision adopted by the Minister of Transport in March 1968, 44 actions for annulment of the project (De.: Anfechtungsklagen) were brought to the courts. =Lawsuits= After the opening of the new Terminal Mitte (now Terminal 1) in March 1972, the planning approval procedure for the new runway was initiated a year later. The result was more than 100 lawsuits before Hessian administrative courts. The opponents of the runway, who had increasingly joined forces in citizens' initiatives (BI), were increasing in number, as both declining flight movements and the oil crisis mitigated against a runway. Some of the runway opponents feared it would serve a function for NATO.\\"Startbahn West\\" ‚Äì Die Waldb√ºrger. I: FAZ, 5. November 2010. For almost 10 years, administrative courts dealt with the planned expansion. For formal reasons, the decision was annulled. In March 1971, the Ministry issued a second planning approval order, which again occupied the courts. At the end of 1978, a citizens' initiative (BI) was founded mainly in the affected double city of M√∂rfelden-Walldorf, but also in Frankfurt and the surrounding area against the expansion. In July 1978, the Federal Administrative Court referred the claims of the runway opponents back to the Hessian Administrative Court. In December of the same year, the state of Hesse sold 303 hectares of land to FAG for the construction of the new runway. The expected logging amounted to 129 hectares. =Intensification of the conflict= With the decision of the Hessian Administrative Court of 21 October 1980 for the construction of the new runway, the legal dispute ended, while the resistance on the ground intensified. On the site of the planned runway West, opponents erected a BI hut from May 1980, which was to be used for the information of walkers. In July, the Hessian Minister of Economics and Transport, Heinz-Herbert Karry (FDP), ordered the \\"immediate implementation\\" for the construction of the runway. In October, however, the Hessian Administrative Court rejected the stop request (to restore the suspensive effect of the opposition). The first tree felling work began before the winter for technical reasons. First, a seven-hectare site was cleared directly at the airport site. On 2 November 1980, 15,000 people, mainly environmentalists and students, as well as many elderly people from the region, demonstrated on the edge of the forest in Walldorf. Since the planned occupation actions of the protest movement failed due to the long-running police concept, the citizens' initiative decided to expand the BI-H√ºtte into a permanently inhabited hut village in order to be able toreact more quickly and appropriately to grubbing-up intentions. As a result, several illegal huts were built as well as a hut church of the Walldorf parish on the airport grounds.H. Karasek: Das Dorf im Fl√∂rsheimer Wald. Luchterhand, 1982. Concrete fence in front of the construction site In May 1981, the Darmstadt government president ordered the expropriation of the site. On 6 October, the already cleared seven-hectare site was occupied by the protest movement and subsequently evacuated by the police. On October 6, hundreds of people had gathered on the site, excavated a pointed trench, and built a tower inside the moat. The evacuation of most of the site was largely peaceful. The tower was comparatively difficult to evacuate; however the squatters left it voluntarily the following evening. A few days after the evacuation, a 2.5 metre high concrete fence was erected to secure the work. The hut village was evacuated on the morning of November 2, 1981. The eviction itself was peaceful; As thousands gathered in the woods outside the police cordons during the day, several controversial police operations against the protesters took place. After the evacuation of the hut village, the construction and clearing work began under massive police protection. Meanwhile, there were repeated attacks from demonstrations on the concrete wall and police officers. Several attempts by the runway opponents to build new hut villages permanently were repeatedly prevented by the police. A planned reoccupation of the H√ºttendorf site on 7 November, out of a rally of tens of thousands of people, was not carried out after disagreements within the movement over the question of violence. Instead of the planned mass crossing of the police cordons, fifty selected demonstrators with bare torsos were let on the premises by the police. Four BI spokespersons then held an inconclusive discussion with the Minister of the Interior Ekkehard Gries (FDP) on the cleared area of the hut village about a possible halt to the grubbing- up work until the decision of the State Court (so-called \\" Naked Saturday\\").M. Himmelheber (Hrsg.): Startbahn 18 West, Bilder einer R√§umung. Minotaurus, 1982. Another version of this story has it that the day was called Naked Saturday because many protesters went to the site too lightly clothed for the weather, which turned out to be cold.Henrik Schmitz. Accessed October 2019. Demonstrations On 14 November 1981, more than 120,000 people demonstrated in Wiesbaden against the runway plans. The Land returning officer was handed 220,000 signatures for a referendum. At the rally, The Frankfurt Magistrate's Director Alexander Schubart called for a \\"visit\\" to the airport the next day. The following day, runway opponents blocked the entrances to the airport for hours. When the police used force against the demonstration, the demonstrators fled to the adjacent highwaywhere they erected barricades. In order to clear the motorway, the police deployed federal border protection units dispatched by helicopter. For more than a week, the city centre of Frankfurt and other cities in the Rhine-Main region were effectively closed by daily protests. An occupation of Frankfurt Central Station was prevented by police. In the late evening of November 3, 1981, a police operation against a runway demonstration took place in Rohrbachstra√üe in the Nordend district of Frankfurt, in which several demonstrators were seriously injured.Die Gr√ºnen im R√∂mer (Hrsg.): Frankfurt am Main. Rohrbachstra√üe, 1982. Schubart was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on probation for coercion of the state government (Section 105, Section 125 and 240 StGB) and the call for violenceBGH, Urteil vom 23. November 1983, Az. 3 StR 256/83, BGHSt 32, 165; Volltext and discharged from the civil service. After ten years of legal battles, he was only eight months on probation and he was able to remain in the civil service. The request for a referendum ‚Äì which was the last legal way to prevent the construction of the runway ‚Äì ended in 1982 with a negative decision of the Hessian Landtag under Prime Minister Holger B√∂rner (SPD) and rejection due to non-jurisdiction of the Hessian State Court. In the following period, the runway movement, which had shrunk after the events of the autumn of 1981, shifted its activity mainly to weekly \\"Sunday walks\\" to the concrete wall around the construction site. From these weekly demonstrations, attempts were made time and again to dismantle the wall, to obstruct construction work and to attack police forces.Michael Wilk, in: Redaktionsgruppe Schwarzspecht (Hrsg.): Turbulenzen. Widerstand gegen den Ausbau des Rhein-Main-Flughafens. Geschichten, Fakten, Facetten. Trotzdem Verlagsgenossenschaft, 2002, S. 14. =After Construction= Runway 18 W from the North On 12 April 1984, the new runway 18 West was handed over to traffic; opening ceremonies were dispensed with. On 14 April 1984, about 15,000 people demonstrated against the commissioning of the runway 18 West at the wall in the forest. On 2 November 1987, on the occasion of a demonstration on the anniversary of the evacuation of the hut village, 14 police officers were attacked with a police force weapon stolen from an anti- nuclear demonstrationin Hanau on 8 November 1986. Nine officers were shot and police officers Thorsten Schwalm and Klaus Eichh√∂fer succumbed to their injuries. On the same night, a large wave of searches and arrests began against the entire runway movement.Michael Wilk, in: Redaktionsgruppe Schwarzspecht (Hrsg.): Turbulenzen. Widerstand gegen den Ausbau des Rhein- Main-Flughafens. Geschichten, Fakten, Facetten. Trotzdem Verlagsgenossenschaft eG, 2002, S. 17. The runway opponents Andreas E. and Frank H. were indicted by the Federal Prosecutor's Office as death shooters. Frank H. was sentenced in 1991 to four and a half years in prison for offences unrelated to the fatal shootings. Andreas E. was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison. As a result of these events, the remnants of the protest movement against the West runway finally fell apart. In 2011 a fourth runway at Frankfurt Airport was built, against significant public resistance. A year after the fourth runway's construction, the website Airport Watch reports weekly protests have been occurring at the airport against the runway.Airport Watch. 2012. \\"A sea of protest against airport expansion across Europe as a new breed of campaigner emerges.\\" Accessed October 2019. As a relic of the clashes, the concrete wall around the runway remained, a rather rare kind of security barrier around a German airport for the period before 11 September 2001. This wall has since been removed (as of February 2018) and in its place there is currently a triple-finished construction fence, partly secured with NATO barbed wire. There will be a new fence on the site of the old wall. =Flight Specifications= Airbus A320 ready to take off from Runway 18 West The West runway is called '18' because it is almost exactly south-facing, which corresponds to a course angle of 180 degrees. Only take-offs in the direction of the Upper Rhine Plain extending to the south, while the Taunus does not allow departures to the north for reasons of obstacles. Since aircraft are supposed to take off against the wind, take-offs in strong winds from northern directions are only limited or not possible at all.

He first travelled to Egypt in 1899 as an assistant to the zoologist George Albert Boulenger of the British Museum (Natural History) on an ichthyological survey of the Nile. Later he took part in excavations at Gurob in 1903 for Petrie and at Abydos for the Egypt Excavation Fund in 1908-9 and 1912‚Äì13, He was responsible for finding and publishing a description of the Ibis Cemetery. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 meant that he had to cease working in Egypt. He the married andtook residence at Mevagissy, Cornwall where he pursued an interest in horticulture. He travelled to the Andes in 1927 and during the 1920s he presented some Egyptian objects to the Penzance Museum.

Denham became an attorney for banking, brokerage, and corporate interests in New York, Florida, and on the Pacific Coast. In 1928, Denham became a trial examiner. In August 1947, he became the general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB). He held \\"conservative views\\" and wielded \\"considerable influence\\" on labor-management relations and interpretations of the newly passed Taft-Hartley Act. In 1950, US President Harry S. Truman fired Denham (New York Times: \\"left at the behest of the President\\").

Truman, Denham received unanimous approval by the US Senate Labor Committee. He received \\"full and independent powers to investigate violations, file complaints and prosecute offenders before the board.\\" In August 1947, he supported an \\"Anti-Red Affidavit Rule\\" and so sided with US Senator Robert A. Taft.

History  The creation of the Wilm√®s Government was announced on 26 October 2019, when previous Prime Minister Charles Michel announced he would be succeeded by Sophie Wilm√®s ultimately on 1 November 2019, effectively forming a new government. Charles Michel left his post as he had been elected to become the next President of the European Council as from 1 December 2019 and wanted to have sufficient time to prepare for his role as President of the European Council hence leaving already by November. The Wilm√®s Government was governing as a caretaker government, until a new cabinet was formed based on the results of the federal elections of 26 May 2019, for which negotiations were still ongoing. Hence the government was a continuation of the centre minority coalition cabinet of Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V;), the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld) and the Reformist Movement (MR) which together constituted the Michel II Government. On 16 March, the Wilm√®s Government was given support by several opposition parties to handle the coronavirus outbreak in Belgium, for which the cabinet is going to be supported by a majority in parliament by granting it special powers under the form of the Wilm√®s II Government. The opposition parties were giving support for three months to take corona measures, with a possible further three month extension, are the socialists (sp.a & PS), the greens (Groen and Ecolo), the cdH and D√©FI, leaving only the N-VA and the PVDA/PTB and Vlaams Belang in the opposition. Composition The composition of the government was similar to that of the Michel II Government, with the only differences being Sophie Wilm√®s taking over the role of Charles Michel as Prime Minister and David Clarinval coming in to replace Wilm√®s as Minister of Budget, Civil Service, National Lottery and Scientific Policy. =Changes in composition= * On 30 November 2019, Philippe Goffin took the place of Didier Reynders, taking over the portfolios of Foreign Affairs and Defence.

Gate 1664 In 1663, the stadholder of the Great Elector; John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen approved a renovation of the Schwanenburg in the Dutch baroque style by architect Pieter Post and commissioned the construction of extensive gardens that greatly influenced European landscape design of the 17th century. Significant amounts of his original plan for Kleve were put into effect and have been maintained to the present, a particularly well-loved example of which is the Forstgarten. In the middle of the 18th century, the building was reduced by collapse and demolition to its present size. Since then, the judicial authorities are located at the castle, today the castle is the seat of the district and district court Kleve. In the swan tower a small geological museum is located. On the 7th of October, 1944, Kleve was subjected to a huge bombardment. These attacks resulted in huge damage to the town. The bombardment destroyed the historic centre of Kleve, including the Swan tower. The castle was rebuilt between 1948 and 1953.  Swan tower  The old castle has a massive tower, the Schwanenturm (Swan tower) 180 feet (55 m) high, that is associated in legend with the Knight of the Swan, immortalized in Richard Wagner's Lohengrin. Lohengrin first appears as \\"Loherangrin\\", the son of Parzival and Condwiramurs in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival. Wolfram's story is a variation of the Knight of the Swan tale, previously attached to the Crusade cycle of medieval literature. Loherangrin and his twin brother Kardeiz join their parents in Munsalv√§sche when Parzival becomes the Grail King; Kardeiz later inherits their father's secular lands, and Loherangrin remains in Munsalv√§sche as a Grail Knight. Swan towerMembers of this order are sent out in secret to provide lords to kingdoms that have lost their protectors and Loherangrin is eventually called to this duty in Brabant, where the duke has died without a male heir. His daughter Elsa fears the kingdom will be lost, but Loherangrin arrives in a boat pulled by a swan and offers to defend her, though he warns her she must never ask his name. He weds the duchess and serves Brabant for years, but one day Elsa asks the forbidden question. He explains his origin and steps back onto his swan boat, never to return. From Dutch legends of the Swan knight we read that Dietrich, Count of Cleves, Loen in Westphalia and Teisterbant died in 713 and his daughter Beatrix had to succeed him. Pepin of Herstal, duke of Brabant, who could have helped her, also died (714). In 715 Beatrix was attacked from all sides. She fled to her castle in Nijmegen (Valkhofburcht). Then Elias Lohengrin appears, with a golden sword, silver shield with a double, golden cross, a hunting horn and a beautiful ring with a diamond. He defeats the besiegers, marries Beatrix, and becomes king of Francia. They have three sons: Diederik, Godfrey, and Konrad. Afterwards Beatrix lives in a tower on the river close to Kleve. She died young and was later remembered as the ‚ÄòWhite Woman of the Swan Tower‚Äô. Diederik inherited the golden sword and silver shield and succeeded his father in the county of Cleves. Godfrey became count of Loen and inherited the hunting horn. And the youngest, Konrad, became ancestor of the counts of Hessen and inherited the ring with the diamond. Lohengrin was told that he had fought the Moors wit Charles Martel. The legend in historical context There is almost no reliable information about the local power relations in the area of \\"Kleve\\" in the early Middle Ages. The few statements by some historians are also controversial. According to one of these sources to 711 a daughter of a noble family named Beatrix a Count Aelius (or Helios) Gralius married, who was a follower of Charles Martell. This count had possessed areas in the area of Teisterbant as a fief. The son of this marriage had been known as Theodoric I from 742 both Count of Teisterbant and the first Earl of Cleves. Among the descendants of the counties Teisterbant and Cleves were divided. The last descendant of this noble family in Cleves was Count Nufried, after his death in 1008 this family line was extinguished. A \\"Beatrix\\" from a noble house is also called in a legend or fairy tale as the ancestor of the Counts of Cleves, who married a swan knight Elias. At least since the 15th century, the counts and dukes of Cleves derived their origin from this swan knight Elias (Aelius = Elias), Which is related to the figure of Lohengrin. =About Beatrix of Cleves, Countess of Teisterband= Walter, Count of Teisterbant, in the Dukedom of Gelre, District of the Betuwe, died either 724 or 742 (Oudheusden). His daughter and heiress, Beatrix, Countess of Teisterbant, married about 711, Theodoric, Stadholder and Lord of Cleves. Their daughter and heiress, Beatrix, Countess of Teisterbant, married after the death of both her parents to Elias, Aelius, or Elius Grail, Gralius, Graielis, or Grajus, a great hero, Stadtholder of Nijmegen and (Pure Legendary) first Count of Cleves, She died 734.

Learning: Principles and Applications (6 ed.). SAGE Publications. . Associations are seen throughout several schools of thought in psychology including behaviorism, associationism, psychoanalysis, social psychology, and structuralism. The idea stems from Plato and Aristotle, especially with regard to the succession of memories, and it was carried on by philosophers such as John Locke, David Hume, David Hartley, and James Mill.Boring, E. G. (1950) It finds its place in modern psychology in such areas as memory, learning, and the study of neural pathways.Smith, E. E. & Kosslyn, S. M. (2007) Learned associations Associative learning is when a subject creates a relationship between stimuli (auditory or visual) or behavior (auditory or visual) and the original stimulus (auditory or visual). The higher the concreteness of stimulus items, the more likely are they to evoke sensory images that can function as mediators of associative learning and memory. The ability to learn new information is essential to daily life and thus a critical component of healthy aging. There is substantial research documenting aging-related decline in forming and retrieving episodic memories. The acquisition of associations is the basis for learning. This learning is seen in classical and operant conditioning. = Law of Effect = Edward Thorndike did research in this area and developed the law of effect, where associations between a stimulus and response are affected by the consequence of the response. For example, behaviors increase in strength and/or frequency when they have been followed by reward. This occurs because of an association between the behavior and a mental representation of the reward (such as food). Conversely, receiving a negative consequence lowers the frequency of the behavior due to the negative association. An example of this would be a rat in a cage with a bar lever. If pressing the lever results in a food pellet, the rat will learn to press the lever to receive food. If pressing the lever resulted in an electric shock on the floor of the cage, the rat would learn to avoid pressing the lever. =Classical conditioning= Classical conditioning is an example of a learned association. The classical conditioning process consists of four elements: unconditioned stimulus (UCS), unconditioned response (UCR), conditioned stimulus (CS), and conditioned response (CR). Without conditioning, there is already a relationship between the unconditioned stimulus and the unconditioned response. When a second stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus, the response becomes associated with both stimuli. The secondary stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus and elicits a conditioned response. The strength of the response to the conditioned stimulus increases over the period of learning, as the CS becomes associated with UCS. The strength of the response can diminish if CS is presented without UCS. In his famous experiment, Pavlov used the unconditioned response of dogs salivating at the sight of food (UCS), and paired the sound of a bell (CS) with receiving food, and later the dog salivated (CR) to the bell alone, indicating that an association had been established between the bell and food.Timberlake, 1994Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) =Operant conditioning= In operant conditioning, behaviors are changed due to the experienced outcomes of those behaviors. Stimuli do not cause behavior, as in classical conditioning, but instead the associations are created between stimulus and consequence, as an extension by Thorndike on his Law of Effect. B.F. Skinner was well known for his studies of reinforcers on behavior. His studies included the aspect of contingency, which refers to the connection between a specific action and the following consequence or reinforcement. Skinner described three contingencies: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and punishment. Reinforcements create a positive association between the action and consequence in order to promote the continuation of the action. This is done in one of two ways, positive reinforcers introduce a rewarding stimulus, whereas negative reinforcers remove an aversive stimulus to make the environment less aversive. Punishments create a negative relationship between the action and the consequence so that the action does not continue. = Mood = The overall content of moods, compared to emotions, feelings or affects, are less specific and are likely to be provoked by a stimulus or event. The present studies investigated the constituents of the occurrent experience of specific moods like sad or angry mood states. Moods are typically defined by contrasting them with emotions. Several criteria exist for distinguishing moods from emotions, but there is a widely shared consensus that the core differentiating feature is that moods, in contrast to emotions, are diffuse and global. Watson introduced a white fluffy rabbit to an infant, and created a connection between the rabbit and a loud noise. This experience for Little Albert associated a feeling of fear with the rabbit. Memory Memory seems to operate as a sequence of associations: concepts, words, and opinions are intertwined, so that stimuli such as a person‚Äôs face will call up the associated name.Watier & Collin 2012Gazzaniga, Ivry & Mangun, 2009 Understanding the effects of mood on memory is central to several issues in psychology. It is a primary topic in theories of the relation between affect and cognition. Mood's effect on memory may mediate the influence of mood on a variety of behaviors and judgements associated with decision making, helping, and person perception. Understanding the relationships between different items is fundamental to episodic memory, and damage to the hippocampal region of the brain has been found to hinder learning of associations between objects.Stark, Bayley & Squire, 2002  Testing associations  Associations in humans can be measured with the Implicit Association Test, a psychological test which measures the implicit (subconscious) relation between two concepts, which was created by Anthony G. Greenwald in 1995. It has been used in investigations of subconscious racial bias, gender and sexual orientation bias, consumer preferences, political preferences, personality traits, alcohol and drug use, mental health, and relationships. The test measures the associations between different ideas, such as race and crime. Reaction time is used to distinguish associations; faster reaction time is an indicator of a stronger association.Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998 A D score is used to represent the participant's mean reaction time. If the participant's mean reaction time is negative, then that individual is thought to have less implicit bias. If the participant's mean reaction time is positive, then that individual is thought to have more implicit bias. A D score for each participant is calculated by deleting trials that are greater than 10,000 milliseconds, deleting participants that respond quicker than 300 milliseconds on over 10% of trials, determining inclusive standard deviations for all trials in Stages 3 and 4 and also in Stages 6 and 7. Mean response times are determined for Stages 3, 4, 6, and 7, the mean difference between Stage 6 and Stage 3 (MeanStage6 \\\\- MeanStage3) will be computed as well as the mean difference between Stage 7 and Stage 4(MeanStage7 \\\\- MeanStage4), each difference is divided by its associated inclusive standard deviation, and the D score is equivalent to the average of the two resulting ratios.

He frequently raped his daughters from the ages of 12, 13, or 14, fathering six of his own grandchildren with one. He also arranged for other men to rape his daughters. \\\\- The offender cannot be named to protect the lifelong anonymity afforded to his victims. Crimes The offender brainwashed, manipulated and systematically raped three of his daughters during a 20 year period. =Grooming= He groomed and controlled his daughters by invoking magic. He immersed them in a \\"false world\\" involving \\"witchcraft and mysticism\\" and convinced them that they were receiving emails from a psychic named Amelia Sanctuary, which were really from him. The messages demanded sex with him and with other men. =First daughter= He controlled and sexually abused one of his daughters for about 20 years. He began raping her when she was 14 years old, making her pregnant in a matter of months. She agreed to deceive social services by claiming the baby's father was a boy at her school. Then her father raped her \\"nearly every night\\", making pregnant a second time at 16. She became pregnant nine times in total, giving birth to six children. DNA evidence proved he is the father of all six. Two of the pregnancies ended with a miscarriage and one was ended by abortion tablets given to her by her father to conceal it. He was extremely controlling towards her and emotionally manipulated her, saying for example: \\"We are soul mates, we have been together through so many lifetimes. We are meant to be together.\\" He gave her a \\"witch's ring\\" and emailed instructions to her that he pretended were from the psychic Amelia, including to drink his urine. He groomed her into believing all of this was \\"a normal upbringing\\". When on bail following his arrest, he continued having sex with her, pitching a tent near a beach for this purpose. After he covered up a resulting pregnancy by giving her abortion tablets, she was too frightened of him to seek medical treatment and later recalled, \\"I was too chicken to go to the clinic\\". =Second daughter= He raped a second daughter \\"hundreds of times\\" for four years during her teens and also had her raped by a second man. Her first time being \\"basically forced into sex\\" by her father was in a forested area. Then he raped her \\"at least two to three times a week\\" in various locations including her bed and his car. The second man, a family friend, raped her in his own bedroom in a nearby flat, watched by her father. She believes he paid her father. She eventually escaped the abuse by leaving her home. She was initially too frightened to report the crimes due to fears about \\"losing contact with her siblings\\". She later reported the abuse to police because she feared for other \\"girls in the family of that age\\". =Granddaughter= He also controlled and systematically raped one of the daughters of his first victim, from when she was aged 12 or 13 until her late teens. DNA evidence proved that he is both her father and grandfather. He intimidated and controlled her by again invoking witchcraft and by tying her up and sexually assaulting her when she rejected his demands, making her \\"too scared\\" to refuse him. He concealed the abuse by demanding she keeps it a secret and by telling her \\"Nobody will believe you and you will be thrown in the loony bin.\\" He raped her several times a week in various locations, such as the family home, his car, a caravan and a lay-by. He continued sexually abusing her while on bail following his arrest. Trial In late September 2019, the offender went on trial in Swansea Crown Court for 36 rape counts and for an assault by penetration count. One of the rape counts was for procuring rape. He denied all counts. \\\\- He cannot be named due to the legal necessity of protecting the lifelong anonymity of his victims. On 10 October 2019, the jury unanimously convicted him on all 37 counts, after deliberating for four and a half hours. He remained expressionless during the verdict and was remanded in custody. Paul Jones, a Detective Chief Inspector at Dyfed‚ÄìPowys Police, said the perpetrator committed \\"the most serious sexual offences\\" with an impact that \\"is very difficult to summarise\\". He thanked the victims for \\"their bravery and composure\\", which \\"led to the conviction of a very dangerous offender\\". He added: \\"I want anyone who has suffered abuse to know that if you find the courage to come forward, you will be taken seriously, and police will work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice.‚Äù =Sentencing= On 18 October, Judge Paul Thomas QC jailed the offender for 33 years, with a further seven years on extended licence, saying that his \\"totally evil\\" crimes \\"plumbed the depths of depravity\\". He told the \\"cowardly\\" and \\"wicked\\" abuser: \\"You raped them countless times, well into the hundreds. You took advantage of their extreme vulnerability caused by their age and circumstances and abused them cynically, mercilessly, evilly.\\" See also *Kidwelly sex cult *Fritzl case *Sheffield incest case  References   External links  * Rapist father convicted ‚Äì Crown Prosecution Service Category:Child abuse incidents and cases Category:Rape trials Category:Sex crime trials Category:Sex crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Rape in Wales Category:Child sexual abuse in Wales Category:2010s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Rape in the 2010s Category:2010s trials Category:2019 in Wales ","title":"2019 South Wales paternal sex abuse case"},{"id":"62176629","text":"The Araer dam is a dam in Saudi Arabia opened in 1985 and located in Asir region.

Biography Shabelskaya-Bork was born into a noble family of the Russian Empire's Kharkov Governorate. She lived in Germany for much of her life. Around 1903, she married A.N. Bork, after whom she took the name Shabelskaya-Bork. Around the age of thirty, she acquired literary fame, but greater widespread recognition only came with the publication of the novel Satanisty XX veka (Satanists of the 20th Century) (published 1913; reprinted 1934, 2000, 2004, 2011).–ù–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä–æ–∫ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–∞ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç—É.–®–∞–±–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ï. –ê. –°–∞—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—ã XX –≤–µ–∫–∞ In 1902, Shabelskaya was accused by her former lover, the Minister of Finance Vladimir Kovalevsky, for forgery of bills in his name totaling 120 thousand rubles. In 1903, calligraphic examination confirmed that the bills were counterfeit. However, Shabelskaya insisted on transferring the case from a commercial court to a criminal one.

At the end of 1913, she left the newspaper due to a personal conflict with Poluboyarinova. Shabelskaya-Bork died on August 15, 1917, at 10 a.m. in the Sust-Zareche estate of the Novgorod Governorate after a long illness. Around April 1922, Alexander Amfiteatrov wrote memoirs about her similar to an obituary. Officer Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, who took the pseudonym in honor of Shabelskaya-Bork (real name Popov, pseudonym Srariy Kiribey), participated in the assassination attempt on Pavel Milyukov in March 1922.

He is known for his still lifes of fish. Life Few details of his life and career are known. He was born to a family of fishmongers in Antwerp. He has been identified with the Peter Schaeyenborch who was in 1610 registered with the (Guild of Saint Luke) in Antwerp (') as an apprentice of Dani√´l Christiaenssen. Fruit, vegetables, meat and fish on a table with a kitchen maid In 1635, he was registered with the painters' guild in Alkmaar, and was active there until his death. In 1656 and 1657, the executors of the estate of Johan van Nordingen de Jonge (i.e. 'the Younger'; 1625/26-1656) paid him 48 and 56 guilders respectively for two paintings commissioned before van Nordingen's death. He also painted one of the two coats of arms for van Nordingen's grave; he and the other painter, Laurens van Oosthoorn, received 36 guilders each. He taught the marine painter Jan Theunisz Blanckerhoff (1628-1669). Work Van Schaeyenborgh, Pieter de Putter and Jan Dirven were among the earliest Netherlandish painters to specialise in still lifes of fish as the main subjects of paintings rather than as incidental features in larger compositions. He painted still lifes of fish, in oils, said to be very well executed. In 1914, some of his paintings were held on loan by the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. Until 1974, that museum held several of his paintings on loan from armenhuis van Nordingen; presumably in Alkmaar, which had been founded using a legacy from van Nordingen. As of 2019, the museum displays his Visstilleven met gezicht op Egmond ('Still life of fish with view of Egmond') in its permanent collection. In 2019, a group of van Schaeyenborgh's paintings was exhibited at the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. The catalogue praised his depictions of fish which look as if they have just been caught, with beautiful scales and water droplets you can almost touch.

The album was released on October 25, 2019 and is her first release on her own record label Autotelic. The album was distributed by Thirty Tigers, who also distributed her 2017 duets album with her sister Shelby Lynne. It is a companion piece to Moorer's first autobiography Blood: A Memoir, which was released on October 29, 2019. Blood is Moorer's fourth album with producer Kenny Greenberg, who worked with her on her first two albums and on her 2015 release Down to Believing. Background Like Down to Believing, her previous solo release, Blood (and its associated memoir) is a collection of tracks relating the emotions and trauma that Moorer and Lynne went through during their childhoods growing up in a troubled home in southern Alabama which ultimately resulted in the murder-suicide of their parents in 1986. Moorer stated that she considers these songs to be her most revealing, personal and finest works to date. The song \\"I'm the One to Blame\\", the only track on the album not written by Moorer, was composed by her sister Shelby Lynne, who found the unfinished lyrics to the song in one of their father's briefcases. The album features re-recordings of \\"Cold Cold Earth\\" which appeared as a hidden track (due to Moorer's unwillingness to address the topic openly on an album) on Moorer's second album The Hardest Part, and \\"Blood\\", which featured on her 2015 album Down to Believing. The cover of the album is a photograph of Moorer as a child looking happy, with the cover of the memoir being a similar photograph that also included Shelby Lynne.

(1844-1904), Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh Stewart McGlashan or McGlashen(1807‚Äì1873) was a Scottish sculptor and mason, responsible for creating the company Stewart McGlashen (sic) which flourished from 1842 to 1974. He was responsible for devising a series of machines capable of creating highly polished granite (sometimes with a mirror finish) for the first time, and capable of carving intricate designs accurately and fast. At his time he was not held in high esteem by sculptors who saw him as undermining their artistry. Despite not being \\"hand-carved\\" the artistry value of his work is exceptionally high. He was very fond of the use of pink and red granites rather than the typical grey granites. His work is usually done as a single piece of granite, except in unusual pieces such as the Dean Cemetery pyramid. His work was in high demand and changed the face of cemetery design, also adding immeasurably the durability of monuments. Life Scottish Horse Monument William Wallace Monument, Robroyston He was born in Campbeltown in western Scotland on 2 November 1807, the son of James McGlashen or McGlashan, a builder. He was christened on 17 November.

He was living at Canonmills Bridge where he had a second yard and an office. This was more publicly visible, and in theory served Warriston Cemetery in the north of the city. By 1865 he was living in a house at 6 Huntly Street, close to the Canonmills yard. He brought his son, Stewart McGlashan (1844‚Äì1904) into the firm around this time, creating McGlashan & Son. From 1881 (without explanation) the spelling of the company changed to McGlashen. From around 1875 they had a sister company (involved in quarrying) the Edinburgh Granite and Stone Company. He died of heart disease at home 1 Eyre Place in Canonmills, Edinburgh on 9 September 1873. He is buried in Warriston Cemetery. The modest granite stone lies in the overgrown area to the south-west and is hard to access. In 1898 the company opened a third yard at 8 Grange Road serving Grange Cemetery.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1899 Stewart McGlashan Jr was also buried in Warriston Cemetery.

Nisaea or Nisaia ( or ŒùŒπœÉŒ±ŒØŒ±) was the Saronic port town of the ancient polis Megara. In Greek mythology, Nisaea was founded by one of Pandion II's sons, Nisos, who named the region given to him by his father Nisaea, after himself. Control of Nisaea slipped back and forth between Athens and Megara both before and during the Peloponessian War. Athenian allies of the Megarians built long walls which connected Nisaea to Megaris. According to Thucydides, the length of the walls that connected the port to Megara were eight Greek stadia, while Strabo claims the walls to have been 18 stadia in length. A temple of Demeter was located on the road near Nisaea, and a temple of Poseidon located within the port town. Nisaean Megara is thought to have been the birthplace of poet Theognis, but his birthplace is not known for certain The location of the ancient port town remains in debate by historians.  Foundation myth  Scylla cutting the hair of her father Nisos. Sketch by Nicolas-Andr√© Monsiau (1754-1837). During the reign of the mythical Athenian King Pylas, Pandion II fled to Megara where he then married Pylia, the daughter of Pylas. After Pylas was exiled from Athens for the murder of his uncle Bias, Pandion then succeeded his father-in-law as King of Athens. Pandion divided Attica into 4 regions, giving each of his 4 sons - Aigeus, Lykos, Pallas, and Nisos - reign over one of the regions. Pandion's son Nisos was awarded the Megarid, which Nisos then named Nisaea, after himself. When the King of Crete Minos attacked Nisaea, Megareus, son of Poseidon, came from Onchestus in Boeotia to assist Nisos in the war against Minos. Following the war, Megareus married Iphino√´, the daughter of Nisos. Megareus then succeeded Nisos on the throne, and Nisaea was renamed Megara after himself. The name of Nisaea was henceforth confined to only the port-town, while inhabitants of Megara were occasionally called Nisaei to distinguish them from the Megarians of Sicily, their colonists., 6.Theocritus 12.27.  History  In 561 BCE, Peisistratos led an Athenian army to seize Nisaea, where he was successful. Salamis was very close to Nisaea, so Athenians frequently took control of the Megarian port. The Athenians were allies of Megara beginning , and built two long walls connecting Megara with Nisaea. In 446 BCE, the Megarians returned to the Peloponnesian League, and revolted against Athens. The Megarians allied with Peloponnesian troops, and together they overthrew and eliminated the Athenian garrisons in Megaris. The Athenians held Nisaea for a short period of time, but then surrendered it in the Thirty Years' Peace made with Sparta and Spartan allies. = Peloponnesian War = In the first years of the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE), Nisaea was defeated in a naval battle against an Athenian fleet. Following their defeat, eight thousand Peloponnesian soldiers marched to Nisaea, and boarded 40 stolen Magarian ships at the port to attack Athenian strongholds. Following the attack, an Athenian fleet blockaded the harbour of Nisaea to prevent shipments from being received or sent out. In the fifth year of the war (427 BCE), the Athenians under Nicias took possession of the island of Minoa, which allowed Athenian forces to seize full control over Nisaea. In the eighth year of the war (424 BCE), the long walls which had acted as a Peloponnesian garrison were breached and Nisaea fell to the Athenians after a siege of two days. Nisaea became the port of Megara once again in 409 BCE. The walls of Nisaea which had been damaged during the Peloponnesian war were rebuilt in 343 BCE by Athenian army leader Phocion as a symbol of understanding between Megara and Athens.  Culture  = Resources and trade = Nisaea was the only Saronic port of Megara, and was used to ship resources across the gulf and receive resources as well. Aristophanes describes natural salt pans found on the coast near Nisaea, where salt was collected and exported to Athens. Megarians produced high quality wool used for clothing and winter attire which was shipped for trade from Nisaea over the Saronic gulf. Megarians profited significantly from the exports and imports which travelled through Nisaea. = Religion = A Roman marble bust of the goddess Demeter from the National Roman Museum. The bust is a copy of the original Greek version from 4th century BCE. Nisaea housed a temple dedicated to Poseidon, who was predominant to Megarian colonies. Thucidydes noted a shrine dedicated to Enaylius located near the harbour of the port town. A sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros was near Nisaea, which dated back to the Archaic period. An account by Pausanias describes how the roof of the Demeter Malophoros temple had collapsed due to deterioration. The cult of Demeter was brought to Nisaean Megara by colonists in the Archaic period. Neither locations of the temples are known, which is also the case for the location of Nisaea itself. = Poetry and prose = A poet by the name of Theognis is debated to have been from either Nisaean Megara or Megara Hyblaia in Sicily. Although significant figures such as Plato doubted that Theognis was from Nisaean Megara, Theognis' poetry about the Persian Wars is said to be distinctly Megarian, but his origin still remains uncertain. Historians consider it more likely that Theognis is from Nisaean Megara. The poet Semonides mentions the port as \\"the navel of the Nisaians\\" in another poem about the Persian Wars, which was believed to be written in the 5th century. The second-century Greek writer Athenaeus preserves a fragment of the lost poem Georgica of Nicander in his The Deipnosophists. In this lost poem, Nicander declares the roses of Nisaea second only to Emanthian roses as the most fragrant and beautiful.  Geography  Nisaea was the only known Megarian port on the coast of the Saronic Gulf. The exact site of Nisaea is debated because Thucydides' description of the coastal area of Nisaea does not describe the region as it is seen today. A theory of the location of Nisaea which considers the accounts of Strabo, Thucydides, and Pausanias, assumes that Nisaea was located in between Minoa and the mainland. The site of Nisaea has been thought to be located near modern Pachi, which has an Island similarly named Nisis Pachaki in close proximity to Pachi. Some historians also suggest that it is possible the coastal site has been washed away over time.  References   Sources  * Fraser, J.G.

The emphasis of the exercises is on giving and receiving, with the goal of creating a conscious exchange with the forces of nature. Paneurhythmy is practiced for both physical fitness and spiritual development Rila Mountains, Bulgaria  Overview  Peter Deunov, the founder of paneurhythmy Etymologically, Paneurhythmy is derived from three roots: Pan - meaning the whole, everything, the cosmic, Eu -meaning ‚Äúthe true‚Äù or ‚Äúsupreme‚Äù, the essential, and Rhythm - meaning periodicity and correctness of movement. The prefix ‚Äúpan‚Äù implies expression of rhythm that is innate to nature. Based on these etymological roots, Paneurhythmy directly translates to Cosmic Sublime Rhythm. The composer of the music and movements of paneurhythmy, Peter Deunov (also known as Beinsa Douno) developed the exercises in the 1930s in Bulgaria in an adaptive process, excluding some and adopting others in order to discover their optimal form. In Deunov‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúCurrently, the paneuthythmic figures have only the contours of movement. Later they will gain their substance, their core meaning, and details‚Äù The idea of living with harmony with nature is prominent in the practice of Paneurhythmy. Based on Deunov‚Äôs recommendations, Paneurthythmic exercises were to be done in the early morning and outside, preferably in a green meadow, and were most effective in the Spring, beginning the 22nd of March. In his opinion, this was the time when nature was most receptive and contained the most prana, or living energy that could be absorbed by the human body. Paneuthythmy also contains an emphasis on building a new culture of love, fraternity, and freedom. Deunov believed there was a direct connection between thought and movement, that through the harmony between music, movement, and ideas, paneurhytmy was capable of promoting creative forces within the greater society. Over time, Paneurhythmy has attracted the attention of people from different cultures and nationalities, despite the 40-year communist regime in Bulgaria that forbid such practices. The collective dancing at Seven Rila Lakes in the Rila mountains on 19‚Äì21 August can be singled out as the largest gathering, with over 2000 practitioners attending per year from a variety of countries, including France, Canada, Italy, Ukraine, and Russia.  Structure  Paneurhythmy is composed of three parts: 28 Exercises, Sun‚Äôs Rays, and Pentagram, with each exercise having a symbolic significance, expressing a particular thought, feeling, or action. = 28 Exercises = The first part, 28 Exercises, is a set of 28 exercises performed with a partner while moving in a circle with the musicians and/or singers in the center of the circle. Each of the exercises reveal an idea expressed through the name, the movements, and the music of the exercise. The first ten exercises, also known as The First Day of Spring, are performed sequentially without pausing. They represent the symbolic awakening of the soul, as nature is awoken in the Spring. In Deunov‚Äôs opinion, focus on the movement of each exercise and the ideas associated to the exercise was key to performing the exercises correctly. His belief was that the exercises had to be performed thoughtfully and with love, rather than mechanically. Rila Mountains - Sun's rays = Sun‚Äôs Rays = Sun‚Äôs Rays is a composition performed after the 28 exercises. The participants, arranged in pairs, form two groups: 12 rays to symbolically represent the opening of the twelve gates of life as expressed through the 12 signs of the zodiac, and an outside circle around the rays representing the wheel of life. Acting as radii, the 12 rays approach the center symbolizing the reception of vital forces and then go backward to infuse these forces into the outer circle. In the following motion, each partner in a pair performs circles around the other. These motions represent stages of development in which mankind is trapped in a circle of material consciousness. The third and fourth movements symbolize liberation from this circle and the subsequent joy associated with such release, as expressed through the singing and clapping of the participants. Paneurhythmy at the Seven Rila Lakes - Pentagram = Pentagram = The third part of Paneurhythmy, Pentagram, is a symbolic representation of the path of the human soul to perfection, with each ray of the pentagram representing love, wisdom, truth, justice, and virtue respectively. The pentagram is also a metaphor for a cosmic man in motion, with the apices being the head, two hands, and two feet. The exercise is performed with five pairs of participants which move and exchange places, symbolizing that the positive virtues of an individual must be in motion in order for the qualities to have effect. Afterwards, the participants march forward, representing that the embodiment of the virtues has been achieved. These motions are repeated five times.  Therapeutic potential  In the first published book on Paneurhythmy from 1938, the exercises were defined primarily as a method for maintaining good health - in particular, as an intelligent interchange between man and nature with the goal of promoting health through rhythmic and harmonic movements, combined with corresponding music, concentration of thought, and correct breathing. Due to the diversity of the exercises, it is theorized that they engage muscles and joints to improve the locomotion and balance of the human body. A number of studies have been performed to indicate potential positive effects of the practice on participants. A preliminary study in 2004 reported that the majority of participants indicated an improvement in the mental, physical and social aspects of their health, followed by a controlled study in 2007, which indicated significant improvement in the quality of life due to health improvement as a results of 6 months of Paneurhythmy training. Other studies suggest a decrease in perceived stress and ego resiliency. Paneurhythmy has also been studied as a potential method of physical education, with one study suggesting significant improvements in balance, speed, and agility while another provides a comparative analysis of paneurhythmy and eurhythmy .

She became best known for having long-term relationships with two senior British Army officers, General Robert Manners, who was Equerry to King George III, and General Sir Charles Asgill, Equerry to Frederick, Duke of York. Biography [A letter from Lucy to Herbert, with a Post Script from Mary Ann Mansel which continues on the same letter, dated 29 May 1833] \\"My Dear Herbert, How much I wish you were here, that I might nurse you. Surely they will allow you leave of absence to perfect your recovery. This place is now looking beautiful. I hear all is more quiet and you might get away I should hope. Lucy has said how soon I am to lose her. God Bless you. Pray let us hear from you very soon. Your affectionate Mother, M A Mansel\\" Born in Waterford, Ireland, Mary Ann made her life in London and was soon settled in a long-standing relationship with General Robert Manners, a grandson of John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland, who was equerry to King George III. They had six children, all baptised at St. George's, Hanover Square: *Robert Mansel (1802‚Äì1879) was commissioned as a cornet in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons in May 1819. He was promoted to lieutenant in June 1825 and captain in July 1827, and retired in April 1837. In October 1853 became a lieutenant in the Hampshire Militia Artillery, being promoted to captain in December that year and major in July 1869. In January 1872 he resigned his militia commission and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel. *George Mansel (1804‚Äì1844) was commissioned as ensign in the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot in September 1820. He was promoted lieutenant in December 1825 and captain in August 1829. In November 1832 he transferred to a captaincy in the 16th Light Dragoons, holding that rank until his death. *William Henry Mansel (1807‚Äì1812) *Lucy Mansel (1810‚Äì1876) *(William) Herbert Mansel (1812‚Äì1889) joined the 30th Foot as an ensign in June 1830 and was promoted to lieutenant in January 1834. He then became adjutant and lieutenant in the 6th Dragoons in June 1834. In February 1841 he transferred to the 61st Regiment of Foot as lieutenant, then in June 1843 exchanged to a lieutenancy on the half-pay list of the 16th Regiment of Foot. Finally, in July 1846, he transferred to the Ceylon Rifle Regiment as a first lieutenant, retiring the same day. *Henry Edward Mansel (1818‚Äì1820) Hill House, Loose, front elevation. Mary Ann's house as it is today. A fire destroyed the top floor. Hill House, Loose. Original fireplace in the dining room. Before Henry Edward was born, Mary Ann gave birth to a son by General Sir Charles Asgill, equerry to Frederick, Duke of York. They named him Charles Childs (1816‚Äì1884). His first name was the name of his father and grandfather (Sir Charles Asgill, a one-time Lord Mayor of London). Childs was possibly chosen as the surname using the last syllable of Mary Ann‚Äôs maiden name of Goodchild. In the Kelly's Court Directory of 1866‚Äì1867 Charles Childs is listed as a Hop Grower in Loose and Staplehurst, unlike his half-siblings, the Mansel children, who chose a military path, Mary Ann's three surviving sons all having joined the army.Kelly's Court Directory of 1866-1867 When Charles Childs was born in 1816 he was in danger of death. As a Roman Catholic Mary Ann felt it her duty to ensure he had been baptised. She engaged the services of Charles Edouard Drummond, 5th Earl and Duke of Melfort and 10th Duke of Perth (1752‚Äì1840), titular 13th Earl of Perth, \\"Abb√© de Melfort\\" to perform the baptism urgently at home. These events are recorded in \\"Father‚Äôs Book, Members of the Family\\" (written by two of Charles Childs's sons), and this book remains with a descendant living in Mary Ann's home city of Waterford. On 9 September 1818 the trial of Richard Wheeler took place at the Old Bailey. He had stolen a hog from Mary Ann and although he returned the hog he was deported to Australia for 7 years. The trial proceedings revealed Mary Ann‚Äôs name and address in Chelsea (which was very close to the Man in the Moon public house). Mary Ann Mansel's Sun Fire Insurance cover increased substantially in 1821 (just 4 months after she had already renewed it). This coincided with General Sir Charles Asgill selling his York Street house, his wife, Sophia, having died in 1819. Asgill moved in with Mary Ann that year and wrote two codicils from her home in the days before his death. One of these codicils bequeathed a clock and two vases to Mary Ann and his black mare he left to Mary Ann‚Äôs son Herbert. The terms of Sir Charles Asgill, 1st Baronet's will were such that, should his son, General Sir Charles die childless (he did, having no legitimate heirs) then, in those circumstances, he must leave everything he owned to his sisters, nieces and nephews. The General therefore had no choice and could leave nothing to Mary Ann or their son Charles Childs. Interestingly, having spent the final two years of his life with Mary Ann, when Asgill died on 23 July 1823 his obituary appeared in The Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine: 1823, Volume 93, Part 2; This magazine carefully did not mention his place of death, which is very uncommon for a notable personage. It would seem discretion was the better part of valour. When both Mary Ann‚Äôs lovers died in 1823 she fell to pieces and her surviving four Mansel children became wards of Manners‚Äô brother George (1763‚Äì1828) and sister Mary Nisbet (1756‚Äì1834). There is an 1828 court case here which mentions the wardship; mentions the late General Robert Manners; Mary Ann Mansel (who had to give evidence), and her surviving Mansel children, and also mentions Robert Manners' sister Mary and brother George. It appears they were fighting over who got what from Robert Manners' will. She kept only Charles Childs with her, before she eventually left London and firstly moved to Sutton Valence, then Lenham in Kent. She finally moved to Loose (near Maidstone in Kent). She had disposed of her house at 15 Park Place South, Chelsea, now known as Park Walk (which had been provided for her by Robert Manners) (this house was bombed in World War II) and she purchased Hill House in Loose, Kent.\\"Father‚Äôs Book, Members of the Family\\" She is found on the 1851 census (HO 107-1616 - page 19 folio 440) as being at Loose Hill, Maidstone, Kent with Charles Childs, his wife Elizabeth and four of their children. The house was large and probably needed in order to accommodate the growing family. Astonishingly, Charles Childs is listed as a 'visitor', although he lived with her his entire life until her death.1851 census (HO 107-1616 - page 19 folio 440) It is believed that Mary Ann's move from London to Kent was to be near one of her Mansel sons. When her Mansel children had become wards of the Manners family it split the family permanently and the younger ones, in particular, became nomadic, spending their time either at boarding school, at Manners' homes in London or at Bloxholm Hall in Lincolnshire. They never became a tight family unit again although they wrote to one another often and always went to visit Mary Ann as frequently as they could. In his will Robert Manners left Mary Ann a considerable inheritance making her a wealthy woman in her own right. Manners also provided for his children. While Herbert caused his father, and the rest of the family, much worry with regard to his behaviour, they all ended up having successful lives and careers. Descendants of Robert Mansel, in New Zealand, kept the General's frock coat buttons (inlaid in a coffee table), and Herbert's descendants in England have kept 21 letters written by his siblings, mother and father. Mary Ann Mansel and her son, Charles Childs, in the same grave together in All Saint's Churchyard, Loose. The inscription reads \\"In loving memory of Mary Ann Mansel Of This Parish Departed this life October 26th 1854 aged 71 years, For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. It is the spirit that quickeneth The flesh profiteth nothing. (1 Corinthians c15:v22) Charles Childs of This Parish Who departed this life May 6th 1884 aged 68 years\\" At the time Mary Ann made her last will and testament only three of her Mansel children still survived. However, she left everything she owned, including Hill House in Loose (which still stands), to her son Charles Childs. He was her sole Executor. In keeping with her subterfuge even under these circumstances she does not acknowledge Charles as her son - simply her sole Executor and sole Beneficiary. It is not known when Charles Childs entered a relationship with Elizabeth Hayward (1823‚Äì1895) ‚Äì although no marriage certificate has been found it is believed they were married. Together they had 11 children, the first four having been born before Mary Ann died (as can be seen from the census return). Their first-born, a daughter named Mary Ann Childs, died soon after her fifth birthday. After Mary Ann Mansel died, on 26 October 1854, her death certificate records her as being the \\"widow of Robert Mansel, Gentleman\\", a ploy used to continue to hide her tracks. Were it not for the remaining family letters, which make the real situation known (and General Manners is described as the father of her children by his sister (Mary Hamilton Nisbet), and others) her secrets might not have been revealed. She was buried at All Saint‚Äôs Church, Loose and thirty years later, in 1884, Charles Childs was buried in her grave there too. Prior to his death Charles Childs was admitted to the Lunatic Asylum at Barming Heath, suffering from dementia, all his family having abandoned him. In George III, A Personal History, by Christopher Hibbert on page 299 it is recorded:Hibbert, Christopher (1999).

[To celebrate the king's return to health] There were balls at the Pantheon and at the Duke of York's. A f√™te was held by White's, where Colonel Manners, who had taken over as equerry on the expiration of Colonel Greville's tour of duty, sang 'God Save the King' so lustily that he was asked not to be so loud. 'They pretended I was out of tune,' Manners said. 'But it was in such a good cause I did not mind.' The diarist, Fanny Burney, recorded recollections regarding Robert Manners.

It is ostensibly an exhibition of contemporary artistic activity in Ireland in the preceding year. The Future is Self-Organised ‚Äì Artist-Run Spaces was an exhibition curated by Pallas Projects at the Limerick City Gallery of Art. A number of artist-run spaces and projects from Ireland and abroad were represented, as well as artists whom have worked with Pallas over its 20 year history, in this 2015‚Äì16 exhibition.

In 1907 the de Soysa family bought the proprietary rights of the defunct Ceylon Standard and started publishing the Ceylon Morning Leader. Ownership of the newspaper later passed to a syndicate comprising W. A. de Silva, C. E. A. Dias, Charles Peiris and James Peiris. De Silva later became the sole owner. The Ceylon Morning Leader was edited by Armand de Souza until his death in 1921. The paper was then edited by D. L. C. Rodrigo for a short period. The paper campaigned for democratic reforms to the Legislative Council of Ceylon and supported indigenous arts and culture which were largely ignored by other English language newspapers. In December 1914 the Supreme Court of Ceylon jailed de Souza for a month after he wrote critical editorials but he was released after six days due to protests. The paper was noted for its critical coverage of the 1915 anti-Muslim riots and the declaration of martial law. In 1926 S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike wrote a series of six articles in the paper in which he advocated federalism. Newspaper baron D. R.

This act made a number of women to lose interest and discouraged them from attending and consequently the turn out for the meeting dropped in various communities.

This species is a parasitoid of the giant tropical ant Paraponera clavata (commonly known as the bullet ant) and uses both visual and chemical cues to locate its host. A. paraponerae can locate fighting or injured ants through host-produced alarm pheromones. Female flies are attracted to the ant to feed and oviposit, while males are attracted to feed and locate females for mating. There is some evidence that suggests that A. paraponerae is a cryptic species complex of at least four genetically distinct species.  Description  In 2001, it was suggested that A. paraponerae may be a cryptic species complex of at least four genetically distinct, but morphologically indistinguishable species of flies that attack several different ant hosts. Evidence for this claim includes the fact that host- location cues used by A. paraponerae to locate two of the host species differ. Furthermore, these two ant species differ consistently in body size. In addition, mtDNA analysis reveals high sequence divergence between populations, but low sequence divergence within populations.  Anatomy  = Larvae = The larva of A. paraponerae generally resembles that of other, related phorids. However, A. paraponerae larvae possess an unusual anterior crosspiece joining the cornua of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. = Adult = Adult A. paraponerae are small phorids that are about 1.5-2.0 mm long. Notably, female flies possess modified, sclerotized ovipositors which are used to deposit eggs in adult P. clavata.  Distribution and habitat  The geographic range of A. paraponerae is generally coextensive with that of its host, P. clavata. They both occupy the neotropical region and are widespread in the lowland rainforests of Brazil, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and northern Argentina.  Life history  The A. paraponerae life cycle begins when an adult female deposits eggs in a P. clavata worker ant. Egg hatching and larval development occur very rapidly following oviposition. = Oviposition = Upon discovering an injured ant, A. paraponerae females repeatedly probe the ant's body with their ovipositors, focusing primarily on sutures, areas of overlap between sclerites, and ruptures in sclerites. When laying eggs, females completely extend their ovipositors, allowing the egg to pass through the female reproductive tract. = Eggs = While most parasitic members of the Apocephalus family deposit only single eggs into their hosts, A. paraponerae females typically deposit more than one egg per host. Furthermore, several flies may deposit eggs into a single host. Compared to other phorids, the A. paraponerae egg stage is extremely short, usually lasting only 6.5‚Äì7 hours. = Larvae = A. paraponerae larvae develop rapidly within hosts, emerging about 48 hours after hatching. Because females typically deposit several eggs into a single host, and several flies may deposit eggs into the same host, it is not uncommon for up to 20-25 larvae to develop successfully from a single host. = Pupae = The pupal stage of A. paraponerae occurs outside of the host and lasts around 17‚Äì26 days, which is much longer than that of other phorids. The long pupal stage may compensate in some way for the very short larval stage. After this long period of pupation, A. paraponerae ecloses as adults. = Adult = The life history of adult A. paraponerae resembles that of both a parasitoid and a scavenger. Both male and female flies are attracted to injured P. clavata to feed on wounds. After oviposition, females frequently feed on fluid oozing out of oviposition wounds. Males may be attracted to injured ants not only to feed but also to mate with female flies that are attracted to those ants.  Food resources and parasitism  = Host range = An experimental test of potential host range in A. paraponerae showed that adults were able to develop successfully in seven species in four genera: Paraponera clavata (the natural host), Pachycondyla villosa, P. apicalis, O. opaciventris, E. tuberculatum, E. ruidum, and P. obscuricornis. The number of eggs that developed into pupa differed across host species. Pachycondyla apicalis had the highest percent success of puparia, and P. clavata had the second-highest percent success. The success of larval development in species other than the natural host suggests that larvae are not highly adapted to P. clavata hosts. However, ant species in the subfamilies Myrmicinae and Formicinae were not suitable for larval development, indicating a taxonomic limit to host range. = Host finding = A. paraponerae utilize both visual and chemical cues to locate injured or freshly killed hosts for feeding and egg-laying. These injuries species are often the result of interspecies aggression and serve as ideal hosts for A. paraponerae to lay their egg on. Studies have shown that A. paraponerae can distinguish among different ants based on body size. When ant workers of varying species and sizes were treated with hexane to remove species-specific chemical signatures, A. paraponerae was found to prefer larger P. clavata over other tested species. In addition to visual cues, A. paraponerae are also attracted to 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol, which are major products of the mandibular glands of the host ant P. clavata. As these chemicals are released by fighting, injured, and freshly killed workers, A. paraponerae may use these pheromones to locate suitable targets for feeding or egg-laying. In an experiment, A. paraponerae were found to be equally attracted to ants that were treated with hexane, but unwilling to lay eggs on them. This suggests that A. paraponerae is either unwilling or unable to lay eggs on ants lacking the characteristic chemical signals of 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol. More research is necessary on additional host-finding cues, as A. paraponerae are not attracted to other ant species with the same mandibular gland components as P. clavata.  Geographic variation in host-finding cues  Research conducted at Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama and La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica demonstrated geographic variation in host-finding cues. A. paraponerae used 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol as a host location cue at La Selva, but did not do so at BCI. This is the first reported example of geographic variation in host finding cues in a phorid parasitoid.

Origins and use The story and its derivative metaphor are found in America and Europe, from at least the 19th century. A Russian idiom with the same meaning is \\"lighten the sleigh\\" (–æ–±–ª–µ–≥—á–∏—Ç—å —Å–∞–Ω–∏). \\"Russian woman throwing her babies to wolves\\", as envisioned in a 19th C. French engraving The idiom was current among American immigrants from Russia ‚Äì including especially ethnic Germans ‚Äì to the American Great Plains. In Russia, many folktales concerning wolves are told. One such type of tale concerns a troika or other sleigh, or a convoy of sleighs, beset by wolves. One or more passengers are thrown out, to satisfy the wolves or at any rate slow them while they devour their prey, usually to no avail. Other tales tell of parents sacrificing their children to save themselves. In one, a couple throws their baby to the harrying wolves; the baby is not noticed by the wolves, who go on to kill and devour the couple. In one tale, a wedding party of three sleighs is attacked by packs of wolves. Two sleighs are destroyed, and the drivers of the third eject the bride and groom, but to no avail; everyone is killed. In a similar tale the drivers sacrificing the wedding party survive, but are shunned by society. The American novelist Willa Cather's 1918 novel My √Åntonia contains a variation of this version: the characters Peter and Pavel are revealed to have done exactly this, and to have been driven by shunning to emigrate to Nebraska, where the novel is set. The English writer Robert Browning's 1879 poem \\"Iv√†n Iv√†novitch\\" uses this motif; a mother throws her children to wolves attacking her sleigh, and barely survives. The axeman Iv√†n Iv√†novitch, upon hearing her tale, immediately and summarily beheads the woman, for which act he is absolved by the village priest. An 1855 book, The Englishwoman in Russia, has a similar tale and ending and may have inspired Browning's poem. Drs. P's 1974 song, , his most popular, is an extensive reimagining of the story, and the metaphor remains commonly understood and in current use on both sides of the Atlantic into the 21st century.

She is Reader in Equality & Education at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and has written several books, including The Colour of Class: The educational strategies of the Black middle classes. She has been included in the Powerlist list of the most influential black Britons and been recognised by the PRECIOUS award for her work in racial equality.  Early life and education  Rollock was born in South West London to parents from Barbados. Her father encouraged her to focus on her education; she enjoyed reading as a child, and eventually studied English literature. She studied psychology at the University of Liverpool and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1994. Rollock's further education included a Postgraduate Certificate in Family and Couple Therapy at Birkbeck, University of London. She was appointed Head of Education at the Runnymede Trust in 2001. For her doctoral studies she moved to the UCL Institute of Education, where she researched the educational attainment of black students in British secondary schools.  Research and career  After completing her doctorate in 2006, Rollock was appointed a postdoctoral fellow at London Metropolitan University, where she spent three years before returning to the UCL Institute of Education as a research associate. Her research revealed that black children still faced an attainment gap, even if they were as rich as their white counterparts. She has presented her research as evidence to parliament on the attainment of black pupils. Together with the Runnymede Trust, Rollock published The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry 10 Years On, which looked at how British policing must evolve to support the diverse British population. The recommendations included sharing effective practice on recording racist incidents across the criminal justice system, improving the monitoring of racially motivated crime, increasing public scrutiny, addressing the retention and progression of black staff and reviewing the effectiveness of Stop and Search. The report was presented to the Home Office and Ministry of Justice. In Staying Power, Rollock identified that there were fewer than thirty black British women professors in the United Kingdom in February 2019. This shockingly low number (there are 18,000 professors, over 14,000 of whom are white men) was covered in The Guardian, Vogue and Stylist. Rollock identified that the underrepresentation of black women was due to explicit bias, bullying and racial stereotyping. Rollock is committed to making the black women professors more visible, as well as encouraging and supporting more women in to academia. The Black Female Professors Forum was established by Iyiola Solanke in 2019. In 2019 Rollock was appointed to the Home Affairs Select Committee Macpherson Report: Twenty Years On inquiry, which will examine progress in the two decades since the Murder of Stephen Lawrence. She was appointed lead on the black and minority ethnic (BAME) attainment gap at Goldsmiths, University of London. In this role she leads a working group that engages academic and professional services staff as well as students to understand the origins of the achievement gap, and implement various solutions. The efforts are part of a wide Government of the United Kingdom initiative to end inequalities between different ethnicities in higher education. Rollock serves on the Wellcome Trust Diversity & Inclusion Steering Group and the British Science Association Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Group. She is a member of the BBC Academy. Rollock provides regular comment on racial inequality to the media.

It lies on the A417 and is a significant traffic bottleneck. The pub is under threat of closure as part of traffic improvements. Location The pub is situated next to a roundabout junction with the A417, a major road between Swindon and Gloucester via Cirencester. The A436 meets the A417 at this point; the two roads together form a de facto bypass of Cheltenham between Oxford and Gloucester. History View of the pub from the A417 The pub opened in 1784 and is probably named after one of the first British balloon flights: the launching of a small hydrogen balloon by Edward Jenner on 2 September 1784, which flew from Berkeley Castle to Kingscote and then on to a field near Birdlip, the year after the pioneering flights of the Montgolfier brothers' hot air balloon and Jacques Charles's hydrogen balloon in Paris. It was known as the Balloon by 1796 and renamed the Air Balloon in 1802. By 1856, the landlord was brewing beer on-site. The premises were part of the Cowley Manor Estate until some time early in the twentieth century. The pub was bought by Greene King in 2004. Future The pub has been under threat of demolition as it sits alongside a short section of single-carriageway road which is otherwise a high-quality route between the M4 and M5 motorways. The junction is a notorious accident blackspot; from 1999 to 2014 there were an estimated 340 casualties. In March 2019, Highways England proposed improvements that would include demolition of the pub. Highways England has ruled out a junction at the Air Balloon as the local geography and steep hills nearby would make it impossible to build a high- quality road meeting modern safety standards. The road could not be routed anywhere else as it would cut through Barrow Wake, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Highways England stated that it would talk to landowners and assess the social impact of the pub's demolition in a further design stage.

It depicts the Mocking of Jesus and is one of three panels known from a polyptych depicting the passion of Christ. It was discovered in a house in Northern France. In October 2019 it sold at auction for ‚Ç¨24 million, a record for a pre-1500 artwork. It is believed to be the first work by Cimabue to have been auctioned. Description Christ Mocked measures and depicts the mocking of Jesus prior to his crucifixion. The work is painted with egg tempera on a gold leaf background, on a thinned and slightly bowed poplar panel prepared with layers of gesso ground in which a canvas is embedded. It is thought to date from 1280.Auction catalogue (27 October 2019) (PDF) Act√©on It is thought to be part of a diptych, with four painted scenes on each wing, depicting the passion of Christ, sometimes known as the Diptych of Devotion. Two other scenes by Cimabue, painted on wood panels of similar size, have been identified as parts of the same polyptych: Virgin and Child with Two Angels in the collection of the National Gallery in London (discovered in Suffolk in 2000) and The Flagellation of Christ, in the Frick Collection in New York since 1950. Christ Mocked is one of only a dozen works that have been attributed to Cimabue, none of which were signed by the artist. It shares similarities with Cimabue's other works in the way that the facial expressions and buildings are depicted and in the use of light and perspective. The National Gallery describes the polyptych as representing \\"a crucial moment in the history of art\\" as it comes from a time when Italian painters began to move away from the Byzantine tradition towards a more naturalistic representation of events. It is the only known small-scale work of Cimabue to use the same techniques to display a crowd of figures that can be seen in other, larger-scale works, such as his frescoes at Assisi. The scene follows the biblical account in Matthew 27:27‚Äì30. Jesus, in red robe and blue cloak, is standing at the centre of the composition, with his eyes uncovered in the Byzantine style: in contemporary depictions from Northern European, he would be seated and blindfolded. He is impassive, with arms limp and a sorrowful expression, among a crowd of slightly shorter men who are angrily striking Christ with rods, a sheathed sword, or their bare hands; one appears to be reaching up to remove Christ's halo. To either side stands a person with a sheathed sword; buildings in the background in Byzantine reverse perspective frame the scene under a luminous gold sky.Hotel des Ventes de Senlis Sarl, 27 October 2019, Turquin An infrared reflectogram has revealed Cimabue's underdrawing. Damage to the paint shows the panel was removed from the bottom left corner of a frame, and the edges have been evened-up with a dark border. It is suspected that an original red border is underneath, like the two other surviving paintings from the diptych, which also show similar woodworm holes. With the other two panels, they appear to be three of a set of four panels, with the upper right panel missing. A reconstruction of an unusual c.1320 eight-panel Florentine diptych by the Master of San Martino alla Palma suggests the fourth panel would be a crowd scene of The Betrayal of Christ, while the four panels of a hypothesised second leaf would depict the Way to Calvary, the Crucifixion, the Entombment, and the Last Judgment. A similar Venetian diptych c.1300 held by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts also has six Passion scenes, with the Virgin and Child and the Last Judgment. All seem to be associated with communities of Clarissan nuns in northern Italy.  Discovery and sale  The painting was discovered hanging above the hotplate in the kitchen of an elderly woman living in Compi√®gne, northern France. The woman was in her 90s and was selling the house, which had been built in the 1960s, and moving from the area. Ahead of the move in June 2019 the owner called in a local auctioneer to determine if any of her possessions were worth selling, the remainder were to be thrown away. The owner and her family recognised Christ Mocked only as an old religious icon and thought it had little value. The owner could not remember how the work came to be in her possession, but thought it to be of Russian origin. The auctioneer had only one week to evaluate the contents of the house, but noticed Christ Mocked almost immediately. They thought it to be of an Italian primitivist nature and possibly worth ‚Ç¨300,000 to ‚Ç¨400,000. The owner was advised to send it away for testing and it went to Eric Turquin and his colleagues at the Turquin Gallery in Paris. Testing under infrared light revealed similarities with other works by Cimabue and it was attributed to him. Some other items from the house sold at auction for ‚Ç¨6,000 and the remainder were sent to landfill. The work was put up for auction at the Act√©on H√¥tel des Ventes, in Senlis, Oise, on 27 October 2019 with an estimate of ‚Ç¨4‚Äì6 million. Some 800 people attended the auction and there was interest from several foreign museums. The work reached a hammer price of ‚Ç¨19.5 million, which reached ‚Ç¨24 million once selling fees were included. The winning bid was placed by London-based dealer Fabrizio Moretti, on behalf of two anonymous collectors. This set a new world record for a pre-1500 artwork sold at auction. The price was believed to be so high as it was the first time a work by Cimabue had sold at auction. Both seller and purchaser decided to remain anonymous, though the buyers have been reported to be two Chilean nationals living in the United States. On 23 December 2019 the French government put in place a 30-month ban on export of the work. It was hoped that funds could be raised to purchase it so it can go on display at the Louvre alongside the artist's Maest√†.

In 1875, at the age of 18, he succeeded his father to the family pottery works of William Baker and Co in Fenton, Staffordshire and the country house of Hasfield Court in Gloucestershire. His father had inherited both properties from his unmarried elder brother William in 1865. William Meath Baker established himself as a country squire at Hasfield, having little active involvement in the management of the Fenton pottery, and serving as a JP for Gloucestershire and High Sheriff for 1896‚Äì97. He was a keen mountain climber and member of the Alpine Club. He was loyal to his Staffordshire roots and in the late 1880s funded at his own expense the building of Fenton Town Hall and other buildings in the town.

Stevenson, usually known as H.W. Stevenson, was an English champion player of English billiards. He held the world professional title in billiards five times, including two times that he was declared champion without playing.  Biography  Stevenson was born in Hull and became a billiards marker, a role that involved keeping the score of billiards matches. He moved to South Africa, but returned to England by 1893. In 1900, Stevenson and Edward Diggle challenged Charles Dawson for the Billiards Association title. Stevenson beat Diggle in the preliminary round, compiling a break of 648 in the match, but lost 6,775‚Äì9,000 to Dawson. In January 1901, Stevenson beat Dawson to win the title, but Dawson then won it back in April. Following the April match, Stevenson challenged Dawson again. The match was due to be played within three months of the challenge being made, but both players agreed to a postponement until November. Although Dawson was aware that the match was due to be played in November, he organised an exhibition match with Diggle in Glasgow for that month and was unavailable for the championship match. Stevenson refused a further extension, and was awarded the title. Dawson and Stevenson contested for the title again in 1903, with Dawson winning a close match 9,000‚Äì8,700. Following this, the championship was not contested for several years. In 1908, the Billiards Association declared Melbourne Inman the champion. The Billiards Control Club (BCC), formed in 1908, promoted a championship for which Stevenson was the only entry, and he was therefore declared the BCC champion. Inman challenged Stevenson for the BCC title, and they played in 1910, but the match was abandoned following the death of Stevenson's wife on 4 May 1910, with Stevenson leading at that point by just 158. Stevenson subsequently beat Inman for the title twice, in October 1910 and April 1911. Stevenson declined to defend the title in 1912, opting instead to undertake an exhibition tour. Stevenson played Inman again 1919, but was soundly beaten, 9,468‚Äì16,000. His highest break at billiards was 1,016, made in 1912.

Education and career Dorr is a graduate of Boston University, and earned a Ph.D. in 1990 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her dissertation, Lexical Conceptual Structure and Machine Translation, was supervised by Robert C. Berwick. Dorr joined the University of Maryland faculty in 1992. At Maryland, she became the founding co-director of the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing Laboratory, and associate dean of the university's College of Computer Math and Natural Sciences.

Book Dorr is the author of Machine Translation: A View from the Lexicon (MIT Press, 1993), a revision of her doctoral dissertation. It describes an approach to interlingual machine translation in which, rather than directly translating text from one language to another, it goes through an intermediate form represented using conceptual semantics. The translations between the syntax of each natural language handled by the system and this form are made using government and binding theory, in contrast to the more typical approach from that time which performed this sort of translation using phrase structure grammars and the unification of feature structures. Her system was embodied in the UNITRAN system, and translated between English, Spanish, and German. However, her work was criticized for its lack of completeness (inability to handle certain common grammatical structures in these languages). Subsequently to Dorr's work, rule-based machine translation systems such as hers that embody a deep hand-coded knowledge of each of the languages they translate have largely been supplanted by statistical machine translation and neural machine translation, and some of Dorr's own highly- cited later work instead focuses on data-driven approaches to machine translation.See, e.g., Recognition Dorr was president of the Association for Computational Linguistics for 2008.

She was arrested for breaking windows in March 1912, and while imprisoned contributed to the Suffragette Handkerchief.  Biography  Mary Ann Hilliard was born in Cork in 1860, to Dominick Hilliard, accountant and Margaret Duke and had two brothers and a sister. Known as Minnie, she trained as a nurse in England from 1876 and was a senior staff member at the Alexandra Children's Hospital, Bloomsbury, London in 1908. The Suffragette Handkerchief (March 1912) alt= Hilliard was involved in the suffragette window-breaking by around 200 protestors in March 1912, and was arrested and sentenced to two months hard labour. Hilliard and sixty-seven other Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) suffragettes who were imprisoned in Holloway Prison embroidered their names on a cloth which became known as The Suffragette Handkerchief. This was a brave act of defiance in a prison where the women were closely watched at all times, and it is thought that Hilliard started it, as she kept the souvenir of her fellow prisoners afterwards. Signatories include Eileen Mary Casey, Alice Davies, Edith Downing, Katharine Gatty, Margaret Macfarlane, Helen MacRae, Alice Maud Shipley, Frances Williams and other leading women from WSPU mass window-smashing protests. Hilliard's own embroidered name is in blue thread on the right of the title 'Votes for Women' (which she may have embroidered), and 'Holloway Prison, March, 1912'. Although Hilliard may have intended to donate it to the British College of Nurses, according to the British Journal of Nursing in March 1942, she was said to have kept it until she died in 1950. The location of the item after Hilliard's death is unknown; it resurfaced in the 1960s at a jumble sale.  Later life  Hilliard was a war nurse in World War One with Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service and served at the front in Italy, nursing prisoners. Her health deteriorated in the 1920s and she retired from nursing to live in Wembley, London. She died in 1950. Her funeral was at Park Lane Methodist Church and cremation at Golders Green.

The program helps families subsidize child care payments. It is a program designed for Rhode Island and uses guidelines and funding from the Child Care and Development Block Grant, along with state funding. CCAP, along with other federal and state programs, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Rhode Island Works Program, CCAP is aimed to help impoverished children and their families financially.  Eligibility  Like most state programs, there are requirements in eligibility to sign up and receive subsidies. It is aimed to help children under the age of 13, however, children 13-18 can receive subsidies if the child has special needs physically or mentally. Every child recipient must be a US citizen and resident of Rhode Island, however, the parent applying does not need to provide evidence of citizenship, but does need to provide proof of relation to the child, along with proof of living at the same residency. Families must also provide verification of employment or schooling/training in order to be approved. There is a 20-hour a week minimum work requirement for low income families applying, or proof of attending some type of school or other program that would prevent a parent from taking care of the child. There are different thresholds for income and household size that determine how much assistance someone is eligible for. The general threshold are families whose income is under the 180 percent of the federal poverty line. Providers for child care must also be approved in order to be given assistance. The recipients of the care can choose the type of care they want, as long as the provider has been deemed eligible. The providers are usually licensed day cares, but family members and even neighbors can act as a child care provider as long as they get approved by the program.  Financing  CCAP is both federally funded and generally funded from the state, with a majority being federal. The Child Care and Development Block Grant is the basis for the federal funding the program receives, and state revenue takes care of the rest of the budget. For the year 2015, the total budget for CCAP was $51.1 million.United States, Congress, ‚ÄúChild Care Assistance Program.‚Äù Child Care Assistance Program, 6 Apr. 2015\\\\. http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/sfiscal/Other Documents/Child Care Assistance Program.pdf. State funding for expenditures in 2014 totaled 19.7%, and federal funding being 80.3% for that year. Total expenditure dropped from $73.8 million in 2007, but it has been steadily increasing since 2012. The number of people enrolled in CCAP affects its expenditures. As of 2019, there are currently 9,125 families in the state signed up for CCAP.Boardman, Andrew, \\"The Rhode Island Earned Income Tax Credit: History and Analysis\\" (2019). Senior Honors Projects. Paper 691. https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/srhonorsprog/691https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/srhonorsprog/691 Enrollment in 2007 was roughly 11,000, and dropped by 27.2% in 2008, which explains why expenditures also dropped around that time. Enrollment has also been increasing steadily since 2012.  Child Care Providers  CCAP is open to recipients choosing whatever makes them comfortable with who provides child care for their children. There are three approved providers for CCAP: Licensed enters, certified family providers, and approved family/friends. Family or friends can become child care providers for recipients as long as they apply to become approved. As of 2014, Licensed centers were the largest settings where children received subsidies for their care, totaling 73.3% of all subsidies. Certified family providers were responsible for 25.8% of subsidies, as family/friends only totaled 0.8% of all subsidies.  Recipients  The largest age group of children that received subsidies from CCAP were pre- school ages, which was 41% of all CCAP recipients in 2014. Regular school aged children took account for 35% of recipients, and infants/toddlers took up 23.2% of recipients for 2014. CCAP applies to different amounts of child care needed. Recipients require a variety of different times, including: full day, evening, half day, pre/post school, weekend, or even summer child care.Silver, Barbara E, and Charles T Schmidt Jr. STATEWIDE SURVEY OF CHILD CARE RATES IN RHODE ISLAND. Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training and Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 2018, STATEWIDE SURVEY OF CHILD CARE RATES IN RHODE ISLAND, http://www.dhs.ri.gov/Documents Forms/2018RIChildCareMarketRateSurvey.pdf. The program does not have a limit to the required time of child care a recipient needs.  Expansion  There has been an interest in expanding the program, as the amount of child care assistance needed in the state is larger than the amount of care providers. This is especially true in more rural parts of the state, such as Foster, Glocester, Burrilliville, Coventry, and North Kingston. In these more spread out rural areas, there isn't as many providers that residents need. This creates long wait times to get a child care provider, sometimes up to 9 months. There has been no recent changes in CCAP that is helping expand child care to these areas.

She was known for rejecting the traditional Victorian designs and for creating her own contemporary embroidery designs. Life Dean was born in Bromley in 1911. Her mother, Marion, was a natural artist and her father was a share dealer. She gained her skills at the Royal School of Needlework. She graduated in 1932 and went on to study dress design and leatherwork at Bromley School of Art. Her early promise was recognised in 1935 when the Royal College of Art gave her a Royal Exhibition. In 1946 she left the Eastbourne School of Art where she had been a lecturer for seven years to join King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne. Some were concerned that textile skills was diminishing and she helped the Needlework Development Scheme who were trying to re-energise needlework teaching in schools. She was rejecting the traditional Victorian designs used in religious embroidery and she wanted to create her own contemporary designs. In the 1950s she took on commissions from Guildford and Chelmsford Cathedrals, King's Lynn Minster, St Martin's Church, Dorking, and St Giles' in Northbrook, Illinois. In 1958 she published her book \\"Ecclesiastical Embroidery\\" and she was then lecturing on the subject in Britain and in America. In 1968 she established new interest in the subject when she helped curate an exhibition at St Paul's Cathedral.Groups were formed in Britain of people interested in contemporary ecclesiastical embroidery. In 1969 with funding that included the descendants of the Knights of the Garter, Dean set out on a five-year task to create five embroidered panels to hang in the Rutland chantry of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The five panels represent the annunciation, the visitation, the adoration of the magi, the temptation of Christ in the wilderness and the miracle at Cana, although only one panel is normally of display to the public. Dean died on 27 March 2001. Her 1984 piece \\"Head of Christ\\" is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The embroidery is made by a difficult technique and it was inspired not by a commission but Dean's own imperative to give a good use to some remaining skeins of Japanese gold thread.

The Pat O'Leary Line, (also known as the Pat Line, the O'Leary Line, and the PAO Line) (1940-1944), was a resistance organization in France during the Second World War. The Pat O'Leary escape line helped allied soldiers and airmen stranded or shot down over occupied Europe evade capture by Nazi Germany and return to Great Britain. Downed airmen in northern France and other countries were fed, clothed, given false identity papers, hidden in attics, cellars, and people's homes, and escorted to Marseille, where the line was based. From there, a network of people then escorted them to neutral Spain. From Spain, British diplomats sent the escapees home via British-controlled Gibraltar. The Pat O'Leary Line was the oldest established escape line. Collectively, the escape lines helped about 5,000 allied military personnel escape occupied Europe. The O'Leary Line received financial assistance from MI9, a British intelligence agency. The Pat O'Leary Line exfiltrated more that 600 allied soldiers and airmen from France to Spain. More than 100 volunteers or \\"helpers\\" as they were often called, mostly French, working for the O'Leary Line were arrested and imprisoned by Vichy French or German authorities. Most were imprisoned for the remainder of the war and some were executed or died in concentration camps.Neave, Airey (1970), The Escape Room, New York: Doubleday, pp. xiii, 121 Overview The Pat O'Leary Line was one of several escape and evasion networks in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during World War II. Along with networks such as the Comet Line, the Shelburne Escape Line, and others, they are credited with aiding about 5,000 Allied airmen and soldiers, about one-half British and one-half American, escape occupied Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II. Approximately 12,000 people, nearly all civilians and almost one-half women, were engaged in the work of the escape lines. About 500 of them were arrested and executed or died in concentration camps.

For example, on one day, October 14, 1943, 82 bombers with 800 crewmen of the U.S. Eighth Air Force were shot down or crash-landed in occupied Europe. Most of the crewmen were killed or captured, but some were rescued by escape lines and made it back to Great Britain. \\"The morale of airmen on bases rose considerably when they saw their buddies miraculously reappear after having been shot down over occupied Europe.\\"Ottis, Sherrie, Sherri Green (2001), Silent Heroes, Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, p. 25 History The Dunkirk evacuation of France by British forces in June 1940 left thousands of British and Allied soldiers stranded on the European mainland. Most surrendered or were captured by the Germans, but a few made their way to Vichy France, nominally independent, especially the coastal city of Marseille. From July to October 1940, working for the British intelligence agency MI9, an Armenian, Nubar Gulbenkian, laid the groundwork for a network of people to guide stranded allied soldiers over the Pyrenees mountains to neutral Spain from where they could be repatriated to the United Kingdom. As the war went on most of the escapees became airmen shot down over occupied Europe. Neave, pp. 63-65 The initial leader of what became known as the Pat O'Leary Line was a Scottish soldier, Ian Garrow. Taking advantage of the limited freedom of movement initially accorded him by the Vichy government, he organized the escape system, recruited dozens--and later hundreds--of volunteer workers for the escape line, and found funds for the expenses of housing, transporting, and documenting the allied soldiers and airmen. At first, some of the exfiltrations to Spain were by sea, but the more common route was for local guides (often smugglers familiar with the Pyrenees), to accompany the soldiers and airmen on foot across the border to Spain. The escapees were then moved onward by train or car to the British Consulate in Barcelona, and then flown back to the United Kingdom, usually from Gibraltar. Garrow gathered funds for the expenses of the escape line from residents of Marseille, but MI9 later financed the costs.Neave, pp. 64-67Ottis, pp. 76-80 Working for the escape line became more dangerous in November 1942 when the German military occupied Vichy France and took control of much of the government.\\"This Day in History: November 10, 1942,\\" , accessed 26 Oct 2019 Garrow was arrested and imprisoned by Vichy French police in October 1941. His successor was Albert-Marie Gu√©risse, a medical officer in the Belgian army. After Belgium's surrender to the Germans in 1940, Gu√©risse became a British intelligence operative. He adopted the code name \\"Pat O'Leary,\\" thus the name of the escape line.Neave, pp. 66-67. Gu√©risse was arrested by the Gestapo on March 2, 1943, betrayed by Roger le Neveu who had worked with the O'Leary line but had been bribed or blackmailed to work for the Germans. The arrest of Gu√©risse and many others nearly destroyed the O'Leary Line, but a 61-year-old woman named Marie Dissard (code named \\"Fran√ßoise) revived the Line in summer 1943. Dissard lived in Toulouse and sheltered many downed airmen in her apartment and escorted them or directed their escort to Spain. Airey Neave, the M19 agent who supported the Pat O'Leary line, said that the eccentric Dissard and her cat were \\"almost the sole survivors\\" of the O'Leary Line. Under the leadership of Dissard, the remnants of the O'Leary Line are often called the \\"Fran√ßoise Line.\\"Neave, pp. 116-121\\"The Pat O'Leary (or PAO) Line,\\" , accessed 28 Oct 2019 Routes The O'Leary Line collected allied soldiers and, after 1940, mostly airmen from northern France, plus a few from other countries. The military personnel were passed down from safe house to safe house and escort-to-escort to Marseille. Initially, many were exfiltrated by felucca down the French and Spanish coasts to Gibraltar. Later, as security tightened, the Line used land routes through the easternmost Pyrenees, and, as that became more hazardous, shifted its main routes to the high Pyrenees further west which were not patrolled extensively by German soldiers, French police, and Spanish border guards. With the arrest of many O'Leary Line workers and leaders in Marseille, the primary collection point for escapees in 1943 and 1944 became Toulouse.\\"The Pat O'Leary Line,\\" WW2 Escape Lines Memorial Society, , accessed 29 Oct 2019 The most famous of the routes is known as the \\"Freedom Line,\\" (\\"Chemin de la Libert√©\\"). From Toulouse, the airmen were taken to the town of Saint-Girons at the foot of the Pyrenees. From there the guide and escapees hiked across the border, via the slopes of Mont Valier, in elevation, and onward to the small town of Esterri d'Aneu in Spain. The distance from Saint-Girons to Esterri d'Aneu was only in straight line distance, but it involved several days of climbing steep slopes, often through snow and ice.Goodall, Scott, \\"The Freedom Trail (chemin de la libert√©): WWII escape route to Spain,\\" , accessed 29 Oct 2019 Betrayals Given the large number of helpers involved in escape lines, their isolation from each other, and their geographic dispersion, the escape lines were relatively easy to infiltrate by German agents. The O'Leary line was nearly destroyed by two betrayers: Harold Cole, code name \\"Paul,\\" and Roger Le Neveu, called \\"Roger Le Legionnaire.\\" Cole worked his way into the confidence of the O'Leary line by successfully escorting several groups of airmen from Lille in northernmost France to Marseille. The former English soldier was captured by the Germans in December 1941, and gave the Germans information who led to the arrest of several dozen helpers working for the O'Leary Line, nearly destroying the Line in northern France.Ottis, pp. 93-96 Neveu, a Frenchman, similarly worked his way into the confidence of the O'Leary Line and was responsible for the arrest of Albert-Marie Gu√©risse and other O'Leary line helpers in Marseille in March 1943. The O'Leary Line was reconstituted in Toulouse where it functioned for the remainder of the war.Ottis, pp. 112-117 Other notable members of the Line Important helpers of the Pat O'Leary Line in Marseille were George Rodocanachi, a medical doctor, Donald Caskie, a pastor in charge of the British Seaman's Mission, and Louis Nouveau, a businessman, and his wife, Ren√©e.Ottis, pp. 80-84 All three men were arrested and spent the rest of the war in prison.

Metcalfe, a genuine product of the West, is widely recognized as one of its foremost painters. Life Augusta Metcalf was born Augusta Isabella Corson on November 10, 1881, in Vermillion, Kansas. Metcalf's parents originated from Pennsylvania. They moved to Illiinois briefly. Then they moved to Kansas where Metcalfe was born. Then they moved from Kansas with their four children to Oklahoma in 1886. In 1886 when they moved to Oklahoma, it was to what is now known as the Oklahoma Panhandle. It was known at that time as No Man's Land, which was being applied to the Public Land Strip. While they lived there, the 1980 Organic Act made the strip part of Oklahoma Territory, which brought it homestead rights. In 1893, the Corsons claimed a homestead at the mouth of Turkey Creek on the Washita River near Durham, Kansas. Durham is in the Western half of Oklahoma Territory which would become Day County. Later it would become Roger Mills County. Metcalfe was raised on that homestead. With neither school attendance or art lessons, she still won first prize in the state fair in 1911 for one of her paintings. It was here on this 640 acres that Metcalfe lived her remaining 89 years. Career Metcalfe was often referred to as \\"the Sagebrush Artist\\" due to her use of oils and watercolors. She used these types of paints to produce images that came from her own experiences of ranch life in Oklahoma in its early years. In 1905, Metcalf married James Metcalfe. They had one child, Howard Metcalfe. In 1908, James left them. She took up the ranch operations but always found time to paint her scenery of western life. Her paintings were awarded prizes in state fairs and shows. Her paintings were displayed in galleries, including New York City. In 1950, Life Magazine featured reproductions of some of her art. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1968.  Legacy  Metcalfe died on May 9, 1971, in Oklahoma. The former homestead of Augusta Metcalf was made into a museum after her death. The estate is now referred to as the Break O' Day Farm & Metcalfe Museum. The site is on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma.

The film is set as a \\"Glasgow Noir\\", playing within the drama and thriller genres. The story starts with investigative journalist Charlie Colquhoun's career in a rumble, with danger of a lawsuit by lawyer Harris Hill, Colquhoun's old schoolmate, while defending a client. Elise Gray, Coulquhoun's ex-wife, passes onto Charlie the job of finding a missing teenager, Tommy.

Derek Elly, Vanity, says: (...) Debut scripter Robert Murphy‚Äôs four- letter dialogue is square-jawed without tipping over into parody. Main problem is getting an emotional hook on the characters, all of whom are either cold or thoroughly disagreeable, including the central protag. Though Dunbar holds the screen here better than in the recent (also noirish) 'Innocent Lies', he‚Äôs still a fine character actor rather than a leading man.'' Audience involvement isn‚Äôt helped by an unbalanced soundtrack in which much of the already hard-to- comprehend thick Scottish dialogue battles against music and effects. In as densely a plotted movie as this, you really need to be able to follow every word. (...) Newcomer Faulkner is excellent as the bruised but tough Tommy. Aside from the sound mix, tech credits on the pic are superior, given the paltry $1.2 million budget. Andy Harris‚Äô inventive production design and Martin Sharpe‚Äôs editing are both on the money.

About this one: \\"Unlike a majority of Park City's pyramid houses which have truncated hip or clipped gable roofs, this house has a true pyramid roof. It is an archetypal example of the pyramid house, one of the simplest, most clearly stated examples of the pyramid house type in Park City.

In Park City houses the projection of a rear shed extension was often made to provide space for a wood or coal shed. In-period rear extensions are part of Park City's architectural vocabulary. Although in many cases an extension represents a major alteration of the original house, it usually contributes to the significance of a house because it documents the most common and acceptable method of expansion of the small Park City house.

Applicants for the program are eligible if they are living in the state of Rhode of Island and also if they meet the Department of Human Services eligibility requirements that are set forth.  Background  The Rhode Island Works program was introduced in 2008 as a mean to provide aid to low-income families who are struggling to find jobs and the proper amenities for their children. It replaced the former program known as the Family Independence Program (FIP) which was created in 1996. The program came to be after each states were provided a block grant under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or TANF. The grants from TANF allowed each state to use the money in their own program to help the low income families within their state base on needs of the people. Unlike the previous program FIP, RI works became more restrictive in the new changes it implemented such as limiting the amount of time family remains in the program from 60 months to 48 months. The cash assistance that is used to help low income families are controlled at the state level. They are to decide the amount of money that is needed to give to a family that has no income and after the level of cash assistance is set for each level. The states also have to decide the earning disregard and the benefit reduction rate. Earning disregard is how much a family can make and continue to keep the benefit and the benefit reduction rate is the level in which benefits are reduced and the earning increased above the earning disregard. The states are free to set the benefit levels and make adjustments that they see fit their state welfare program.  Eligibility Requirement  In order to be accepted into the program there are many qualifications that are required for a family to meet: The family must have a child or a pregnancy that requires dependency. There is also an income limit in which the family must meet as well as the asset limits. An applicant must also be a U.S. Citizens or an eligible non-citizen. When it comes to the cash assistance, the amount of money each family receives depends on the incomes, household size, and the living condition the family is in. In a two parent household, either one or both of the parents must work a combined of at least 35 hours a week. The program also allows minors under the age of 18 who are parents or pregnant to receive cash assistance. When it comes to minors who are parents, they must live at home with their parent or legal guardian. If they are unable to live with a parent or legal guardian, their living arrangements must be approved and monitored by the Youth Success Program. The cash assistance will be given to the minor parent through their parent, legal guardian or whom ever is their primary care provider. While receiving the cash assistance, the minor parents must enroll in secondary education in order to continue receiving money from the program. = Time Limit = After July 1, 2008, all applicants that were applying for cash assistance were limited to 24 months out of any 60-month period for a lifetime limit of 48 months. A family may continue to receive cash assistance after the time limit if they are able to provide proof of hardship. The Department of Human Services can only continue to provide cash assistance after the time limit if exempted families who claim hardship does not exceed 20% of the average monthly number of families that need assistance in a fiscal year. Rhode Island is not the only state that has a low time limit policies. In fact, many states have changed the time limit on their version of the TANF program. For example, the state of Arizona reduced their TANF time limit to 24 months. This resulted in the benefits of over 3,500 low-income families to end and many other families will find that their benefit are slowly getting cut as they get closer to the 24 months time period. Even in the state of Maine where their program had no time limit as long as the families were working or are involved in work related activities, enacted a 60-month time limit policy.  Effect of the Program  It has been reported that over 4,100 families receive the RI Works benefit and they live in almost every city in Rhode Island. Besides the family about 7,200 children and 2,400 adults also receive the benefits that the program has to offer. In about one-third of families, the children are the ones receiving the assistance because their parents are disable. Officials of Rhode Island are working to repeal the 24 month time limit because of the belief that it is not enough time for the parents to gain skills needed to retain a job. They are also looking to improve the program by allowing parents to receive 2 years of education at the Community College of Rhode Island to further their training and education. In the health care field, there are some disagreement on whether the program help participants retain their job. When training welfare recipients in health care occupations, it does not assure that they will partake in the sector. It does not take away from people's dissatisfaction in the job such as the emotional investments and lack of competitive wages. For people who feel they are compensated unfairly, they maybe unwilling to continue with the job. Instead, dissatisfaction will lead to higher turnover rates in the job.

He was also nicknamed \\"The Professor\\" and \\"Destroyer\\". Although his role within ISIL is unclear, he is reported as one of ISIL's top commanders and tipped as a potential candidate for ISIL leadership succession. However days after the death of Al-Baghdadi, ‚ÄòAbdul-Rahman Al-Mawlah known as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was ultimately chosen as the new declared leader of ISIS. Early life Qardash is an Iraqi Turkman and was born in Tal Afar, Iraq. He studied in the Islamic Sciences college in Mosul. Qardash was a Major General within the army of Saddam Hussein. Qardash was jailed in 2003‚Äì2004 by the US authorities with al-Baghdadi in Camp Bucca, a detention facility in Basra, following the invasion of Iraq and the ouster of Saddam Hussein's regime, Al Qaeda Qardash joined al-Qaeda in 2007. He became a religious commissar in al-Qaeda in Nineveh, later in Al Jazeera, and in early 2008 became Qaeda's \\"wali\\" of Al Jazeera. He organized a number of military operations against Iraqi forces and the Iraqi population on behalf of al- Qaeda. In early 2010, he became assistant and consequently, with the approval of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi \\"wali\\" of the northern provinces including Mosul, South Mosul, al Jazeera and Kirkuk. ISIL At the end of 2011, he met Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and joined the Islamic State serving in the Baghdad region. He was trusted with the industry and development portfolios for ISIL. Then he moved to Syria to establish firearm and explosive factories and storage facilities, and met Al-Baghdadi almost a hundred times for coordination of ISIL operations. After the rift between ISIL and Al Nusra Front, he was assigned \\"wali\\" of al-Sharqiyyah including Syrian Al-Hasaka, Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa. After the declaration of the IS caliphate in July 2014, his rank rose quickly as \\"wali of Al-Baraka and assistant to Abu Mohammad al-Adnani and after the death of the latter on 30 August 2016 as the chief of the Islamic State's Delegated Committee (al-Lajna al-Mufawwada)Dawla. La storia dello Stato islamico raccontata dai suoi disertori, Gabriele Del Grande, Milano, 2018 and deputy leader of Caliph al-Baghdadi. He was known as \\"The Professor\\", because he graduated in Islamic Studies in Mosul, whereas the nickname \\"The Destroyer\\" comes from his reputation as a ruthless persecutor. He is also famous as head of security for Islamic State operatives, and as the coordinator of IS terrorist cells in North Africa and Europe. During the International military intervention against ISIL, Qardash oversaw operations against the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo and the Syrian Arab Army in Deir ez- Zor. Qardash also personally oversaw the selection of suicide bombers and the conduct of suicide operations for the Islamic State. He supervised the fabrication and storage of mustard gas eventually used against Iraqi forces. Qardash also helped command ISIL troops in the Siege of Koban√Æ, various Palmyra offensives (Tedmor), and finally during the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, Baghuz being the last stronghold of ISIL in Syria. At the end of the operations in Baghuz on 23 March 2019, he surrendered and was arrested. As of 2014, Qardash was in his mid-50s.  Reputed ISIL leader  There were reports, refuted later, that Qardash assumed the position of leadership of ISIL on 27 October 2019 following the death of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi in the Barisha raid conducted by the United States Army in northwest Syria. A statement in August 2019 attributed to ISIL's propaganda arm, the Amaq News Agency, said that Qardash had been named al-Baghdadi's successor. Some analysts dismissed the statement about Qardash assuming ISIL leadership as a fabrication. Rita Katz, a terrorism analyst and the co-founder of SITE Intelligence, noted that the statement used a different font when compared to other statements and it was never distributed on Amaq or ISIL channels. Declaration of al-Qurayshi as leader The allegedly false statement re- emerged in October 2019 following the death of al-Baghdadi, and was reported on by several news organizations, including Newsweek.ISIS Already Has a New Leader, But Baghdadi May Not Have been running the Group Anyway A few days later, on 31 October, ISIL presented Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi as the name of the individual who was Baghdadi's successor, and not Qardash. Rumoured death Hisham al-Hashimi, an ISIL analyst and counter-terrorism advisor to the Iraqi government,Iraq's new war against Islamic State: Halting the group's budding rural resurgence said in October 2019 that, according to Iraqi intelligence sources, Qardash had died in 2017 and his daughter was being held by Iraqi intelligence. He said Qardash's death had been confirmed by both his daughter and other relatives. As of 31 October, his death has not been confirmed by other sources. Capture The Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS) said in May 2020 that they had taken custody of Abdul Nasser Qardash. Qardash is the highest ranking Islamic State officer to ever be taken into custody. INIS issued a statement saying \\"Today, the terrorist named Abdul Nasser al-Qardash, the candidate to succeed the criminal al-Baghdadi, was arrested. The arrest came after accurate intelligence.\\" INIS also distributed a picture of a somber and thin Qardash wearing a long-sleeved flannel shirt. On 21 May 2020, the Iraqi National Intelligence Services further elaborated that Qardash was in charge of manufacturing chemical warfare agents to attack Iraqi troops. It said: \\"Qardash was responsible for the production and development of mustard gas, which was used for attacking Iraqi forces across the country. He plays a prominent role in the negotiation process between the group [ISIL] and its factions, as well as with other terrorist movements\\". There are conflicting reports however that Qardash may have been initially arrested in Syria in 2019 by Kurdish forces but was handed over to the Iraqi authorities only recently (May 2020). The Syrian Democratic Forces affiliated with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) had captured Qardash after the Boghuz Battle and kept him for months before delivering him to the Iraqi authorities. SDF/YPG quoted his full name as Taha Abdel Rahim Abdallah Bakr al Ghassani Al Makni Hajji Abdul Nasser Qardash () also known as Abu Muhammad born 1967 in Tel Afar and from the inhabitants of Hayy Mshayrfeh in Mosul. His transfer to Iraq was coordinated with the US-led International Coalition. After his capture, al-Qardash confirmed in an interview with Al Arabiya television: \\"There was a massive reevaluation of the Islamic State after it lost vast areas including Kobani and many other areas.

She became known in history for the case against her for incest with her cousin Marcus Licinius Crassus, who allegedly attempted to frame her for breaking her vow of chastity in order to acquire her property. Licinia belonged to a prominent family. She became a Vestal in 85 BC, and remained a Vestal until 61. She was the cousin of \\"triumvir\\" Marcus Licinius Crassus. Their close relationship gave rise to rumors. Licinia was eventually publicly accused of having broken her vow of chastity by incest with her cousin after an occasion in which she had been closeted alone with him. Licinia refuted the charge by stating that the man in question was her cousin and that they had been alone only to discuss the purchase or sale of some of her property. Her defense was successful and she was freed from charges. Plutarch described the case: :\\"And yet when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the Vestal virgins and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the Vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property.\\" References * Robin Lorsch Wildfang: Rome's Vestal Virgins Category:Vestal Virgins Category:1st-century BC Roman women ","title":"Licinia (1st-century BC vestal)"},{"id":"62178201","text":"PDRA may refer to: *Pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter, a type of bacterium *Parental Divorce Reduction Act *Participaroty disaster risk assessment *Postdoctoral research assistant *Postdoctoral Research Award, funded by the Qatar National Research Fund *Preventable drug-related hospital admission *Professional Drag Racers Association ","title":"PDRA"},{"id":"62178213","text":"James Nutter may refer to: * James A.

Early life  Emily Roebling was born in 1879, the daughter of Charles Gustavus Roebling and Sarah (or Sallie) Ormsby Mahon Roebling. Her father was an engineer, president of John A. Roebling's Sons, a steel wire and cable company. Her Prussian-born grandfather, John Augustus Roebling, was best known as the civil engineer behind the Brooklyn Bridge. Roebling was raised in Trenton, New Jersey. In 1905 she rescued her father's stable of horses during a fire, and assisted firefighters in their work. In 1908 she unveiled the bronze statue of her grandfather in Trenton. She was an avid tennis player and horsewoman, and was considered one of the first women in Trenton to drive her own automobile.  Wealth and philanthropy  = Blind education = Roebling took an interest in blind education in New Jersey, and was appointed to a commission to study the needs of blind residents of the state before she married and moved to Philadelphia. As part of that work, she organized an exhibit of work by blind crafters of New Jersey, including handmade lace, crochet, and knit items, at Atlantic City in 1909. She was also editor-in- chief of the newspaper for the 1908 Charity Fair in Trenton. = Fairwold = After marriage, Cadwalader lived part-time in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, in a house known as Fairwold.

The last Savarona, at the time, was the \\"largest, most luxurious, most expensive private yacht ever created\\". In 1937 the yacht was a factor in charges of tax fraud against the Cadwaladers. The Cadwaladers sold the 440-foot yacht to Turkish president Kemal Atat√ºrk in 1938. The yacht remains in Istanbul and was restored in the 1990s; it is still considered \\"one of the world's largest yachts\\".

It was intended for the carriage of passengers on intercontinental flights, especially between Great Britain and Australia. No prototype was built because of a lack of funding. Design and development Even before the Second World War, the British aircraft manufacturer Saunders-Roe (often known as Saro) had considered the construction of seaplanes for the transatlantic service. In 1939 the firm planned a machine of 85 to 90 tons, but the plans were curtailed by the start of the war. Resumed in 1943, the study resulted in a design of 150 tons, which ultimately became the Saunders-Roe Princess, of which only three examples were manufactured. Despite this failure, Saro was contacted by J. Dundas Meenan, consulting engineer from the firm Heenan, Winn & Steel,http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1948/1948%20-%201758.html on behalf of the Peninsular & Oriental (P & O) shipping company. He was interested in a plane that could carry at least 1,000 passengers under the conditions of comfort of a transatlantic ocean liner. Saro then proposed project P.192, a 670-ton seaplane powered by 24 Rolls-Royce RB.80 Conway jet engines with of thrust each. The aircraft was designed to have flown at a cruising speed of and an altitude between . Its range would have been . The route between London and Sydney had already been planned, via Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta, Singapore and Darwin (Australia). The fuselage would have been divided into 5 decks with the passengers divided into compartments of 6 places with convertible seats in berths for the night, in a similar fashion to railway carriages. First class passengers would have had their own bars, dining rooms and washrooms. An improved galley would have served all of the decks by freight elevators. The crew was to have consisted of 7 technical flight crews with their own rest quarters, and 40 cabin crew, as well as a steward as on a liner. The engines were installed very far from the hull to avoid spray on takeoff. They would have been supplied with air by two sets of air inlets; one set above the wing when the aircraft was on the water, and another in the leading edge during the flight. Marine rudders would have facilitated maneuvers on the water. Neither P & O nor the British taxpayer were willing to finance such a project, it did not go beyond the stage of the drawing board.

The motif of nude actor Chris Evans holding the severed head of Donald Trump was covered by the Fox News television program America's Newsroom and featured on Fox News Insider, as well as other news media outlets such as The Associated Press and The Blaze. This resulted in threats to the artist, hate mail, and the need for a police escort.

The Uyghur text is represented by three manuscripts, two from Turfan and one from Qomul. A colophon to the Matrisimit notes that it was translated from toxr√Ø. Since the text shows a \\"clear dependence\\" on the MaitreyasamitinƒÅ·π≠aka, scholars named the unidentified language of that text Tocharian on the assumption that toxr√Ø was related to the Tocharoi of ancient Greek texts.Zieme 2000, p. 48. The MaitreyasamitinƒÅ·π≠aka was originally a long text consisting of twenty-seven acts of ten to fifteen leaves (twenty to thirty pages) each.

These initial sessions were quick and fruitful; guitarist Chris Shy contacted vocalist Pete Murray shortly after Lo-Pro's third studio album's release in 2013, and the EP was released in March 2014. The songs were written over emails between Shy and Murray, and after sessions went well, Murray recruited past Lo-Pro bassist John Fahnestock as bassist, while Shy recruited Evanescence drummer Will Hunt, a musician he had always desired to work with historically. The band did not all work together in one place until the first day of the songs recordings. Work on a follow up, full-length album started shortly after the EP's release, with the band entering the studio in August 2014. However, the band went quiet for over a year, with Hunt later giving an update in October 2015 that the band had been working on new material \\"for the better part of a year\\", but that progress was slow due to the members other commitments, complications with record labels, and wanting to take their time with perfecting the music.

Kenney was invited to form the 30th Alberta Legislature and became the 18th Premier of Alberta, following the 2019 Alberta general election where Kenney's United Conservative Party (UCP) won a majority of seats in the Alberta Legislature leading to the resignation of Premier Rachel Notley. The approval rating for Premier Kenney's response to the Covid-19 pandemic is the lowest in Canada, falling to 67 per cent in April to 51 per cent in August. By March 3, 2020 Kenney's approval rate among Albertans had dropped to 47 per cent from 60 per cent in September 2019. Reasons for the drop in popularity included the UCP's response to the 2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests which included the bill targeting those who disrupt critical infrastructure with severe penalties. Other concerns included aggressive cuts in the 2019 and 2020 budgets designed to balance the budget and support the oil and gas sector. Reductions to funding for post-secondary institutions and to municipalities and the freeze on spending on health and public schools also raised questions. The provincial government unilaterally changed the way doctors could bill the province and warned that there would be freezes or cuts to government employees in the spring of 2020. Concerns were raised about the cost of the Canadian Energy Centre and about the March 4 decision to \\"fully or partially closing 20 provincial parks and seeking \\"partnerships\\" for 164 more.\\" The bill that targeted those who disrupt critical infrastructure with severe penalties also raised concerns. By April 7, 2020, a combination of interconnected unprecedented global events‚Äîincluding the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the coronavirus recession, the 2020 stock market crash, and the 2020 Russia‚ÄìSaudi Arabia oil price war with the \\"collapse in oil prices\\" represent‚Äîwhat Premier Kenney called‚Äî\\"the greatest challenge\\" in Alberta's \\"modern history, threatening its main industry and wreaking havoc on its finances.\\" By April 19, as the collapse in the price of oil worsened, Alberta's benchmark crude oil‚ÄîWestern Canadian Select‚Äîdescended to negative pricing. Major events in the first year of Kenney's premiership The UCP government moved quickly to repeal the Carbon Tax, to take the first steps towards lowering corporate taxes to the most competitive rate in Canada‚Äîeight per cent by 2022‚Äì23, and to defer arbitration on public sector wages. They established the commission an inquiry into anti-Alberta energy campaigns, called the Canadian Energy Centre‚Äîa 'war room'. A report was commissioned on Alberta's finances by Janice MacKinnon's task force, that recommended freezes and cuts that would help to reach the UCP's goal of eliminating the deficit by 2023. It focused on slashing health care costs and various measures related to the public sector, including education. The report's mandate did not include the impact of potential revenue if a provincial sales tax were introduced. By September 2019, polls showed that Premier Kenney had a 60 per cent approval rate. The November 2019 fall budget closely followed the MacKinnon's August report's recommendations. The first presumptive COVID-19 case in Alberta was announced by Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health on March 5, Hinshaw. On March 17, Premier Kenney declared a public health state of emergency. By the end of his first year as premier, Kenney's overall performance approval rate had dropped to 47 per cent with the leader of the opposition rising to 46 per cent approval rate. 2019 election Kenney won the United Conservative Party leadership election October 28, 2017. He previously represented Calgary Midnapore. In the 2019 Alberta general election held on April 16, 2019, Kenney won with won 54.88% of the popular vote and 63 seats in the legislature. The 30th Alberta Legislature was constituted after the general election on April 16, 2019. Cabinet and Office of the Premier On April 30, the cabinet was sworn in by Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, Lois Mitchell. Ministers in the newly formed cabinet included Travis Toews who was appointed President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance on April 30, 2019. Doug Schweitzer as Minister of Justice and Solicitor General, Jason Nixon as Minister of Environment and Parks , Sonya Savage as Minister of Energy, Nixon was appointed House Leader, and Doug Schweitzer, Ric McIver, and Savage were appointed as Deputy House Leaders on April 30, 2019. 30th Legislature  =1st Session (2019)= During the Spring Sitting of the 1st Session of the 30th Alberta Legislature, which spanned May through July, 2019, the Kenney government passed about thirteen pieces of legislation, including the Act to Repeal the Carbon Tax, the Alberta Corporate Tax Amendment, and the Public Sector Wage Arbitration Deferral Act. Premier Kenney established a one- year $2.5 million Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns and a Calgary-based $30 million 'war room' to \\"fight misinformation related to oil and gas\\". =2nd session (February ‚Äì July 2020)= Bill 32, Restoring Balance in Alberta‚Äôs Workplaces Act, 2020, was introduced by Labour Minister Copping, on July 7, 2020. Minister Copping said Bill 32 will counterbalance \\"significant changes\\" made during the NDP tenure, that favoured unions at the expense of the \\"rights of job creators\\". There are numerous changes to \\"workplace rules and union activities\\" which include where and how unions can picket and an opt our option which allows union members to choose to have their \\"union dues go to political parties or causes.\\" =Carbon tax= As promised in his election platform, Premier Kenney's first piece of legislation was Bill 1: An Act to Repeal the Carbon Tax, which had been put into place in November 2015 during the premiership of Rachel Notley. Premier Kenney was one of four provincial premiers that challenged the constitutionality of Canada's carbon tax. Kenney has loudly \\"denounced\\" carbon taxes and threatened \\"more legal action\\" after a Saskatchewan superior court dismissed the legal \\"challenge of the constitutionality of the federal carbon tax.\\" Both Ford and Kenney have increased their criticisms of carbon taxes saying they will \\"either trigger a recession or sink the oil patch,\\" according to an October 10, 2019 article in The National Observer. On October 10, 2019 the UCP tabled Bill 19, the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) legislation, which is a provincial carbon tax on industrial emitters. Industrial emitters will pay \\"$30 per tonne of emissions\\" with an estimated reduction in emissions of \\"32 megatonnes in 2030.\\" The funds collected will go towards \\"deficit reduction and technological advancements with respect to climate change.\\" There is no carbon tax on consumers. Premier Kenney had said that Climate Leadership Plan introduced by Rachel Notley \\"crippled the Alberta economy.\\" This claim was refuted by the November 15, 2019 Government of Alberta report, \\"Economic Assessment of Climate Policy in Alberta,\\" which was submitted by the Kenney's government as a court document to the Alberta Court of Appeal, as part of Alberta's constitutional challenge of the federal government's carbon tax. The Alberta government's \\"own analysis\\" revealed that Notley's carbon tax economic effect was \\"an average reduction in annual growth of Alberta's gross domestic product (GDP) of only 0.05 per cent.\\" =Public Inquiry into Anti- Alberta Energy Campaigns= On July 4, 2019 Premier Kenney announced a one- year $2.5 million Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns. The inquiry will include interviews, research, and potentially, public hearings. Kenney announced the creation of the public inquiry along with the \\"Energy War Room\\" in a release by the UCP party during his election campaign. Kenney cited \\"the intrepid reporting of journalist Vivian Krause,\\" who has spent ten years examining foreign funding of Canadian environmental non-profit organizations (ENGOs). In the press release, Kenney said that the inquiry may follow up on investigations done in other jurisdictions, including \\"the January 6, 2017 Backgrounder for the United States investigation, \\"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\\" that contained, \\"clear evidence that the Kremlin is financing and choreographing anti-fracking propaganda in the United States.\\" He could also include evidence from the March 1, 2018, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology report, \\"Russian Attempts to Influence U.S. Domestic Energy Markets by Exploiting Social Media\\" from the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\\", which states, \\"the Kremlin manipulated various groups in an attempt to carry out its geopolitical agenda, particularly with respect to domestic energy policy.\\" Premier Kenney says that \\"foreign-funded efforts\\" are undermining Alberta's oil and gas sector. The backgrounder said that RT ran \\"anti-fracking programming, highlighting environmental issues and the impacts on public health.\\" In a talk at Manhattan Institute on September 12, 2018, \\"The Real Fuel of the Future: Natural Gas\\", Kenney said that there were \\"domestic economic benefits from an expanded shale gas industry,\\" but there was a \\"potential American upset of the former hegemony in global gas trade.\\" In 2018 the media was \\"preoccupied\\" with Russian social-media meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2018 Russia attempted to \\"sow discord in our domestic energy debates\\". The March 1, 2018, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology report, \\"Russian Attempts to Influence U.S. Domestic Energy Markets by Exploiting Social Media\\" from the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\\" said that over \\"4,000 social-media accounts linked to Russian entities were engaged in inflaming online debates over pipelines, fossil fuels, and climate change\\". Kenney said that these \\"fake accounts advocated for 'the complete abandonment of specific fuel sources, such as fossil fuels, by touting exaggerated claims about alternative energy sources,' while sometimes both promoting and mocking climate change, all intended to ‚Äúgenerate further domestic [U.S.] controversy.\\" Minister Schweitzer appointed a forensic accountant, Steve Allan, as commissioner of the Public Inquiry, which is tasked with investigating foreign-funded efforts to undermine the oil and gas industry. In November 2019, CBC News reported that Allan, and \\"two other business associates\\" had supported and/or campaigned for Schweitzer in 2018 and 2019, and that Allan had awarded sole- source contracts for them after he was appointed to the $290,000 job as Commissioner. In response to a request for an investigation into a violation of Alberta's Conflicts of Interest Act, in July 2020, Alberta's ethics commissioner Marguerite Trussler found that Minister Schweitzer did not breach the Act when he appointed Allan. Trussler ruled that \\"Just because Mr. Allan made political donations to Minister Schweitzer in the past does not make the subsequent appointment of Mr. Allan as inquiry commissioner a private interest for the minister.\\" In July 2019, shortly after his appointment as chair of the Public Inquiry, Allan had awarded a $905,000 sole-source contract for the inquiry to the Calgary law firm, Dentons Canada LLP, where he was a former partner, and where, Toby Allen, Allan's son is a \\"partner and his good friend, Quincy Smith, also works\\", according to the Canadian Press (CP), and other media sources. In her ruling Trussler said, \\"It does stretch credibility that Mr. Allan did not consider whether or not there may possibly be a conflict of interest in his engaging of Dentons as counsel for the inquiry, given that, for all intents and purposes, the firm gave him free office space and both his close friend (although that alone is not significant) and his son were partners at the firm...[However], [n]either the minister, his children, nor his direct associates had any personal or particular interest in, or anything to gain from, the appointment of Mr. Allan as inquiry commissioner\\". In September 2019, Vancouver-based Ecojustice issued a letter of warning of potential legal challenge to commissioner Allan asking for a response within 30 days. In November Ecojustice requested that the Court of Queen‚Äôs Bench of Alberta investigate whether the reasons for the Inquiry fulfilled the requirements under the Public Inquiries Act. On July 27, 2020, Ecojustice requested that the Court of Queen‚Äôs Bench of Alberta stop the Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns until the court gave its ruling on their November judicial review application. The University of Calgary's Martin Olszynski and Shaun Fluker from the Faculty of Law, raised concerns about the Alberta Inquiry \\"from the perspective of the rule of law and procedural fairness.\\" Their colleagues said that the Inquiry could unjustifiably violate the \\"freedom of expression of the Canadian organizations it is aimed at as well as those associated with such organizations, including their members and supporters.\\" On June 25, Minister Savage announced that the deadline for the Public Inquiry's final report has been extended to October 30, 2020 from July 2 and that the Inquiry's budget has been increased from $2.5 million to $3.5 million. The added funds will be diverted from the Canadian Energy Centre's budget. =Energy war room= In June 2019, Premier Kenney announced the creation of a Calgary-based $30 million 'war room' to \\"fight misinformation related to oil and gas.\\" In an October 9, 2019 press release, Minister Savage announced the appointment of former journalist and lobbyist Tom Olsen as CEO and managing director of the war room which will be called the Canadian Energy Centre Limited (CECL). The Canadian Energy Centre Limited is a private corporation, which means that it is not subject to Alberta's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP Act). Premier Kenney's press secretary Christine Myatt said that keeping CECL's internal operations secret is a \\"tactical and/or strategic advantage to the very foreign-funded special interests the CEC is looking to counter.\\" CEC's board of directors is composed of Minister Savage, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General, Doug Schweitzer, and Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks. The Canadian Energy Centre (CEC) was launched on December 11 by Premier Kenney, Minister Savage and Olsen at a press conference at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). The CEC will \\"highlight achievements in Alberta's oil and gas sector\\" and will \\"refute what it deems to be misinformation about the industry.\\" Kenney said the centre will \\"counter misinformation\\" \\"coming from some environmental groups and others seeking to landlock Alberta's oil and gas\\". On December 11, Olsen described the centre as a place to tell the story of the oil and gas industry in Alberta, which includes rebutting its critics respectfully. A December 14 Medicine Hat News opinion piece, that was critical of the CEC, said that the centre was not \\"subject to freedom-of-information searches and could be used to stifle legitimate dissent and commentary on the oil and gas industry.\\" In his December 18 rebuttal, Olson, who is a former Calgary Herald journalist, said that \\"oversight\\" of the CEC is \\"rigorous\\" and that the centre is subject to the Fiscal Planning and Transparency Act, the Whistle Blowers Act and audits by Alberta's auditor general. Olsen said that \\"campaigns to shut down new pipeline projects and damage the reputation of our oil and gas industry have received tens of millions of dollars from U.S. environmental foundations.\\" This has resulted in the \\"landlocking of Alberta energy\\" which had resulted in the loss of jobs, \\"tens of billions of dollars\\" in capital, less money for public services, as well as \\"lower value for their shareholders that include many of the country's biggest pension plans and investment funds.\\" The CEC logo, which was unveiled at the launch, was also used in the December 11 promotional video, on the CEC's website, \\"on the wall of its downtown Calgary office, and on signs\\". By the evening of December 18, \\"social media users\\" on Twitter began to share side-by-side versions of the CEC logo and the \\"trademarked symbol\\" for Progress Software Corporation, the Massachusetts-headquartered \\"software giant\\"‚ÄîProgress Software, A December 19 Canadian Press report said that the icons were \\"identical, stylized sharp- angled depictions of what appear to be radiating waves... the Progress one is emerald-green and the war room version is two shades of blue.\\" According to a CP report, the Massachusetts-headquartered \\"software giant\\"‚ÄîProgress Software sent an email that morning saying that it was \\"looking into whether Alberta's new energy war room has violated the company's trademarked logo.\\" In a December 19 statement, the energy centre's CEO and managing director, Tom Olsen, said that the logo was pulled and was to be replaced. Olsen said that the \\"design debacle\\" \\"mistake\\" was an \\"unfortunate situation\\". He said that the CEC was in \\"discussions\\" with the marketing agency‚ÄîLead & Anchor \\"to determine how it happened\\". The CEC had selected Lead & Anchor over eight other contractors proposed to the CEC by the Calgary marketing agency, Communo. Steven Lee, the founder of the Foundation for Environmental Stewardship (FES) became the first to be \\"scrutinized by the centre\\". Lee was criticized in a December 10 post entitled \\"Alberta father irked by charity group that targets fossil fuel industry\\" that was posted on the newly launched CEC website. An irate parent was concerned about the presentation and the Three Percent Project handout given to his fifteen-year-old son at his Airdrie, Alberta school on December 5, 2019. Lee received a phone message from a caller saying, \\"I'm a reporter with the Canadian Energy Centre. Our website is launching next week and we will be writing a story about the 3% Project, which has raised concerns among some parents who reached out to us following presentations at their children's schools.\\" The 3% Project is a \\"flagship project\\" of FES, established by then-19-year-old Steve Lee in 2012. On June 25, 2020, Minister Savage announced that a million dollars would be transferred from the CEC's budget to that of the Public Inquiry into Anti- Alberta Energy Campaigns. =Fair Deal panel= On November 9, 2019, in a speech at the Manning Centre in Red Deer, Premier Kenney announced the creation of a Fair Deal panel, to respond to the \\"frustration, the anger, and even the fear felt by many Albertans and other Western Canadians, arising from our current circumstances within the Canadian federation.\\" Panel member, Jason Goodstriker, who died in January 2020, had previously served as the Alberta Regional Chief for the Assembly of First Nations and was also a councillor with the Kainai Nation. On March 16, when the report was submitted there were eight members on the Panel‚ÄîOryssia Lennie, a retired civil servant, who chaired the Panel, Preston Manning, former premier Peter Lougheed's son, Stephen Lougheed, former MLA Donna Kennedy-Glans, Moin Yahya, and UCP MLAs, Drew Barnes, Tany Yao, and Miranda Rosin. Equalization payments in Canada Among other things, Kenney had demanded \\"reforms to the equalization formula.\\" CBC News reported on May 16 that the panel had submitted its final report. Kenney said that he would not release either the report or the province's response to the public, until \\"the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is over.\\" The 64-page report made 25 recommendations that would, if implemented remove some control from the federal government, which includes pushing for changes to the Fiscal Stabilization Program that respond to concerns that Albertans are now \\"receiving a $2.4 billion equalization rebate.\\" The panel advised the province to \\"proceed with the proposed referendum on equalization,\\" to replace the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in rural Alberta with a provincial police force, to create an Alberta Pension Plan to replace and withdraw from the Canada Pension Plan. An article in the Calgary Herald and in The Tyee said that these ideas were introduced in the Firewall Letter sent to then-premier Ralph Klein on January 24, 2001, from Stephen Harper, who was then president of the National Citizens Coalition at that time; University of Calgary professors‚ÄîTom Flanagan, Ted Morton and Rainer Knopff; Andrew Crooks, then-chair of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation; and Ken Boessenkool, who had previously served as Stockwell Day's former policy adviser.A 2015 National Post article summarizes the Firewall Letter as a plea for Albertans to insulate themselves against an \\"increasingly hostile government in Ottawa.\\" Proposals in the letter included \\"creating a provincial pension plan (like the QPP); a provincial police force (like the SQ or OPP); collecting its own provincial income tax (as Quebec does); forcing Senate reform back on to the national agenda; and taking over complete provincial responsibility for health care.\\" =Bargaining rights bill = On June 20, 2019, the Public Sector Wage Arbitration Deferral Act (Bill 9)‚Äîinformally known as the \\"bargaining rights bill was passed into law. Bill 9 was introduced by Minister Toews in order to \\"suspend and delay\\" hearings related to wage arbitration for public sector workers until after the MacKinnon panel report was submitted. which was passed into law on June 20, 2019. is a bill, informally known as the \\"bargaining rights bill\\". The bill affected Alberta's 180,000 public service employees represented by unions in 24 collective agreements. =Corporate tax lowered= The Alberta government has set a goal of balancing the budget by 2022‚Äì2023. As part of Premier Kenney's \\"main strategy to lure investment to the province, stimulate job growth, and resurrect the oilpatch\\" promised during his electoral campaign in their April 2019 campaign platform \\"Alberta Strong and Free,\\" on June 28, 2019, the Job Creation Tax Cut (Alberta Corporate Tax Amendment) Act (Bill 3), introduced by Minister Toews, came into law. Bill 3 included further reductions in Alberta's corporate tax rate in four stages to lower the \\"corporate tax rate for all businesses, from 12 to eight per cent by 2022-23\\". The first cut from 12 to 11 per cent\\" came into effect on July 1. The second cut of 10 per cent will come into effect in January 2020; a third decrease of nine per cent on January 1, 2021, and a fourth cut of eight per cent cut that come into effect on January 1, 2022. Toews repeated the campaign pledge when he announced Bill 13, saying that the \\"cuts should create at least 55,000 jobs in Alberta\\". As well the Alberta's revised tax rates ‚Äîwill increase the province's \\"international competitiveness\\" as they will be lower than those of 44 out of 50 American states, according to Toews. According to an October 26, 2019 CBC News article, when Bill 3 \\"came into effect on July 1, it gave Alberta the lowest corporate tax rate in Canada.\\" Bill 3 \\"formalizes\\" one of the UCP's election promises. Several economists were cited by the UCP in their April 2019 Alberta Strong and Free Platform, including Jack Mintz, Bev Dahlby, and Aaron Stokes of Stokes Economics. Mintx said that the tax cuts would \\"lead to the creation of at least 55,000 full-time private sector jobs\\". Dahlby estimated that the cuts would \\"generate a $12.7 billion increase in nominal GDP\\", a \\"6.5% increase in per capita real GDP\\", and a \\"$1.2 billion in additional government revenues by 2023-24.\\" The Stokes analysis predicted the \\"cut will result in $1 billion less net revenue for the province by 2022-23.\\" On March 4, 2019, the UCP had announced their intention to cut corporate taxes by one third with a prediction of adding $13 billion to Alberta's economy. On January 1, 2021 the UCP's corporation tax will drop to nine per cent on New Year's Day 2021 and eight per cent in 2022, which would represent the \\"lowest rate in Canada by a 30 per cent margin\\". The UCP's Job Creation Tax Cut was intended to lead to the \\"creation of at least 55,000 new jobs, according to economist Jack Mintz. Since 2009, the unemployment rate in Alberta hit its lowest point‚Äî4.3 per cent‚Äîin September 2013 and its highest‚Äî9.1 per cent‚Äîin November 2016. Alberta had experienced boom years in the energy sector starting in 2010, but this boom was followed by a \\"long and deep\\" recession that lasted from 2014 to 2017‚Äîdriven by both low commodity pricing globally and controversial political policies from both the Provincial and Federal Government. When the UCP government were elected in the spring of 2019, Alberta's economy was still in recovery. Overall, by July 2019, about 35,000 jobs had been lost in mining, oil and gas alone. Since 2014, sectors that offered high-wage employment of $30 and above, saw about 100,000 jobs disappear‚Äî\\"construction (down more than 45,000 jobs), mining, oil and gas (down nearly 35,000), and professional services (down 18,000),\\" according to the economist, Trevor Tombe. In 2013, oil tax revenues brought in 9.58 billion, or 21% of the total Provincial budget, whereas in 2018 it had fallen to just 5.43 billion, or 11% of the Provincial budget. In 2013, the energy industry had provided 7.7% of all jobs in Alberta. In 2017, 140,300 jobs representing 6.1% of total employment of 2,286,900 in Alberta in 2017 was due to the energy industry. The unemployment rate in Alberta peaked in November 2016 at 9.1%. The unemployment rate in the spring of 2019 in Alberta was 6.7% with 21,000 jobs added in April. By July 2019, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate had increased to 7.0% and remained at about that level since then. By August 2019, the employment number in Alberta was 2,344,000, following the loss of 14,000 full-time jobs in July, which represented the \\"largest decline\\" in Canada according to Statistics Canada. According to Statistics Canada, in November, Alberta lost 18,000 jobs and the unemployment rate was 7.2%, \\"with declines occurring in a number of industries, led by wholesale and retail trade. On a year-over-year basis, total employment in the province was little changed.\\" As UCP popularity declined considerably by December 2019, the polling agency, ThinkHQ Public Affairs Inc., said that \\"governments tend to get more blame for the economy when times are tough than they do credit when times are good.\\" =Economic Recovery Council (March‚ÄìJune 2020)= In March 2020, Premier Kenney created the twelve member Economic Recovery Council composed of policy and industry experts, to advise the government in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy price crash. Jack M. Mintz chairs the twelve member committee. Council members include Clive Beddoe, who served as WestJet's CEO and who was co-founder of AIMco serving on its board from until 2013, AIMCo's CEO Kevin Uebelein, Robert Blakely, TorQuest Partners' Brent Belzberg, Mainstreet Equity Corporation's Bob Dhillon, Canadian Western Bank's Chris Fowler, Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper, former Prime Minister of Canada, Morgan Construction and Environmental's Peter Kiss, ATCO's Nancy Southern, ARC Financial's Mac Van Wielingen, and Zainul Mawji, who is on the executive board of Telus Corporation. As president of Telus Home Solutions, Mawji focused on increasing the market share in Canada's western provinces, and the Telus \\"consumer health product line.\\" The Council \\"will also focus on strategies for long-term recovery from the crisis, including efforts to accelerate diversification of the Alberta economy.\\" On June 29, 2020, when Premier Kenney outlined his plans for economic growth, he said that the Economic Recovery Council had \\"urged the government to act quickly\\" to get \\"out of the economic slump caused by low oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic.\\" The council told Kenney that, \\"Now is the time to make a move, to get noticed...The fiscal crisis here will be completely insurmountable unless we get back to growth. For us, this is the key strategy to do so.\\" The plan included infrastructure investment in \\"highways, bridges and other projects\\". It also eliminating most \\"use of temporary foreign workers to ensure Albertans are first in line for jobs.\\" The plan included lowering the corporate tax rate to 8 per cent from 10 per cent on July 1, instead of in 2023 as he had originally announced in 2019. Concerns were raised that the immediate implementation of the corporate tax cut to 8 per cent, two years earlier instead of phasing it in over time, is a \\"gift to firms that have already made investments and are earning profits on those investments\\". It will not attract new job-creating businesses, as it is not \\"new information for anybody in Bay Street plotting a big move of employees that would take years.\\" =Blue Ribbon Panel on Alberta's Finances= In August 2019, Janice MacKinnon's task force submitted the report commissioned by Premier Kenney, \\"Report and Recommendations: Blue Ribbon Panel on Alberta's Finances\\". According to Maclean's, Premier Kenney had \\"mandated\\" that the panel \\"figure out how to balance the provincial books without raising taxes.\\" McKinnon, who was Saskatchewan's finance minister, found that \\"Alberta spends more per person on its public sector, and compensates its teachers, doctors and other workers more generously, than other major provinces.\\" The panel recommended that the post-secondary tuition freeze be lifted, and suggested \\"various measures to slash health-care costs and government-wide program reviews.\\" 2019 Budget On October 24, 2019 Minister Toews announced the UCP's first provincial budget. The National Post said that it fulfilled their \\"promise of slight austerity\\" with \\"cuts to spending programs and the elimination of hundreds of bureaucracy jobs\\". The Post said that these and the corporate tax cuts \\"were the key planks of a four-year plan to bring the budget into balance.\\" The goal is to reduce government spending by $4-billion over four years. The 2019-20 budget will \\"run a deficit of $8.7 billion\\" which is approximately \\"$2-billion higher than in 2018-19.\\" The Post said that the changes in post-secondary education were \\"significant\\" with a 12-per-cent funding cut. and a reduction in \\"government grants to post-secondary institutions\\". Together that represents a $1.9 billion in cuts in post- secondary education. Post-secondary institutions will be allowed to increase tuition. The Alberta government has set a goal of balancing the budget by 2022‚Äì2023. The UCP's budget decision to de-index disability benefits met with outrage, according to The Star. Many people were \\"vocal about their disdain surrounding the UCP's decision to reverse the Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH)‚Äôs tie to inflation\\", including Arlene Dickinson, formerly with the Dragon Den‚Äôs. There are currently approximately 70,000 Albertans who receive AISH. On October 28, the Minister Toews introduced Bill 20, an omnibus bill which included a clause through which the government of Alberta could withdraw the $1.53-billion grant it had promised for Calgary's Green Line \\"with just 90 days' notice and without cause.\\" Minister Toews introduced a second omnibus bill, Bill 21, on October 28, as part of his budget that allows the provincial government to \\"cancel its master agreement with doctors if the two sides can't negotiate a new deal.\\" In an October 30 open letter to all members of the Alberta Medical Association, Dr. Christine Molnar, AMA director, said that the \\"bill effectively gives government the power of pre- approval to cancel any physician services agreement without recourse. This is a violation of the sanctity of contracts.\\" The bill would also give the government control over where new doctors can work starting in March 2022, in order to provide better service to rural areas. According to an October 31, 2019 CBC News article, the UCP is \\"working off\\" August 2019, Janice MacKinnon's August 2019 \\"Report and Recommendations: Blue Ribbon Panel on Alberta's Finances\\". 2020 Budget Minister Toews tabled the UCP's second provincial budget on February 27, 2020. Toews said that the $CDN56.8 billion budget is based on an \\"anticipated 38 per cent increase in energy royalties.\\" The increased energy royalties depends heavily on the success of the UCP's corporate tax rate cuts to spur revenue growth through an infusion of capital from private investment and the resulting expansion in both \\"oil production and pipeline capacity.\\" The only other revenue streams in this budget are \\"a vaping tax and the extension of a tourism levy on short-term rentals.\\" David Taras, a political scientist from Mount Royal University said that this budget signaled that the UCP was \\"not blinking\\"‚ÄîThey are \\"sticking with [their game plan] the \\"policy of cuts and deficit reduction in the face of what appears to be a province that's bleeding jobs.\\" The budget included a proposed 10-year strategy intended to increase tourism spending to $20 billion by 2030, which a Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism spokesperson said was \\"ambitious but reasonable\\". \\"Only $45 million of the overall ministry budget is [currently] dedicated to tourism\\" and millions were cut from the tourism budget in this and previous budgets. The Tourism Industry Association of Alberta chair said that this \\"audacious\\" plan does not \\"reflect\\" the \\"conversations\\" held during the \\"pre-budget planning sessions\\" the government had with \\"hundreds of industry professionals\\" in Calgary and Edmonton to \\"discuss recommendations with the government on how to boost the tourism industry.\\" Province-wide, the budget cut $53 million from 2020 through 2023, from affordable housing maintenance. The budget increases homeowners' education property taxes by 3.1 per cent in 2020‚Äì2021, which the government predicts will add revenue of \\"$102 million to a total of $2.6 billion.\\" Operational funding of $8.2 billion for kindergarten to Grade 12 education will remain at 2019 levels, in spite of population growth and inflation. The $20.6 billion budgeted for health received the same criticism from the Opposition party. In their February 28, 2020 report, Moody's Investors Service said that the 2020 budget was credit neutral. According to Moody's, the UCP fiscal plan is subject to \\"significant uncertainties, driven by weak resource sector investments and pipeline projects which are subject to regulatory, political, and other types of delays, much of which is beyond the control of the government.\\" By April 7, 2020, a combination of interconnected unprecedented global events‚Äîincluding the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the coronavirus recession, the 2020 stock market crash, and the 2020 Russia‚ÄìSaudi Arabia oil price war and the resulting \\"collapse in oil prices\\", represent, what Premier Kenney described as \\"the greatest challenge\\" in Alberta's \\"modern history, threatening its main industry and wreaking havoc on its finances.\\" Alberta's credit rating On December 3, 2019, Moody's downgraded Alberta's credit rating from Aa2 stable from Aa1 negative. According to Mount Royal University's political science professor, Duane Bratt, factors influencing the downgrade include the UCP's budget plan that led to an increase in the deficit and concerns about labour unrest with thousands of public sector jobs set to be eliminated. Moody's report said that Alberta's economy's \\"structural weakness\\" lies in its concentration and dependency on non-renewable resources (NNRs) combined with a \\"lack of sufficient pipeline capacity to transport oil efficiently,\\" \\"no near-term expectation of a significant rebound in oil- related investments,\\" and \\"revenue pressures related to UCP cuts to corporate tax rates.\\" Minister Toews blamed the downgrade on the NDP's tenure, during which the province had also experienced a credit rating downgrade, from its very high credit rating of AAA to Aa1. Premier Kenney said in an interview that \\" financial institutions ‚Äî and this apparently includes Moody's ‚Äî are buying into the political agenda emanating from Europe, which is trying to stigmatize development of hydrocarbon energy.\\" With Premier Kenney's June 29, 2020 announcement of the accelerated decrease in the corporate tax rate, Finance Minister Toews said that the cuts and \\"financial supports could jeopardize\\" Alberta's credit rating. Towes said that the estimated cost of the tax cut would range from $200 million to $300 million in FY 2020 and $100 million and $200 million in FY2021. Canada's credit rating was downgraded from AAA by Fitch, which is one of the three largest credit agencies in the United States. On June 30, 2020 Fitch downgrading Alberta's Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), Long-Term Local Currency IDR, and Senior unsecured bonds from 'AA' to 'AA-'. Fitch also affirmed that Alberta's Short- Term IDR is 'F1+.' As well, Alberta's Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings was revised from Stable to Negative. The ratings consider Alberta's stimulus plan which was announced on June 30 which included the \\"acceleration of certain capital projects\\" without giving \\"details on plan impacts to revenues, expenditures and debt issuance.\\" The higher risk rating was also informed by the lack of \\"formally detailed current fiscal challenges\\" and \\"firm details on a path toward an eventual recovery\\", which could lead to \\"further deterioration in credit quality.\\"  Ministry of Energy  Sonya Savage, whose background in energy and the environment includes major projects, such as the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines and with her work as an executive of Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA), was appointed Minister of Energy on April 30, 2019. She is tasked with overhauling the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)‚Äîone of the UCP's campaign promises with the aim of implementing \\"shorter timelines for project approvals.\\" On April 30, the UCP proclaimed Bill 12 which gives \\"Alberta the power to restrict oil and gas exports to British Columbia. According to the Calgary Herald, this \\"could provoke a quick court challenge\\" the Premier of British Columbia, John Horgan. On April 30, Premier Kenney \\"pragmatically backed away\\" from the campaign promise to \\"remove the 100-megatonne cap on oilsands emissions.\\" According to the Calgary Herald, Bill C-48 regarding an \\"oil tanker ban off the northern coast of British Columbia\\" threatened the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines project that Savage had worked on. She was also involved in \\"CEPA's examination of Bill C-69, Ottawa's overhaul of how major energy projects ‚Äî including oil and gas pipelines ‚Äî are reviewed by the federal government.\\" In February 2019, the previous government signed a crude-by-rail program agreement with two railway companies‚Äîand the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Canadian National Railway (CNR) with a goal of reducing the Western Canadian Select price discount that has been exacerbated by the \\"lack of pipeline capacity\\". Through the four- year, $3.7-billion agreement the \\"province would have purchased and shipped 120,000 barrels of crude a day.\\" The NDP had estimated that the program would have generated \\"revenue of $6-billion\\", according to The Globe and Mail. The Kenney government cancelled the agreement shortly after taking office because the \\"financial risks were too high\\". By the end of October 2019 Minister Savage was in ongoing negotiations with the railways related to the \\"number and complexity of the contracts.\\" In November, 2019 Premier Kenney visited Texas in a four-day trip to create more investment in Alberta's oil and gas industry. A The Globe and Mail article said, \\"A single talisman has defined Jason Kenney's time as premier of Alberta: oil. A single talisman has defined Jason Kenney's time as premier of Alberta: oil.\\" Kenney campaigned on supporting the oil and gas industries and expanding the pipeline system. By 2018, \\"chronic pipeline bottlenecks\\" and as a result \\"industry and governments millions of dollars a day in lost revenue.\\" Following the December 2 announcement of mandatory oil production cut backs in Alberta, the price of WCS rose to c.US$26.65 a barrel. The differential between Western Canadian Select‚Äîthe benchmark price for Alberta heavy crude‚Äîand West Texas Intermediate (WTI)‚Äîwhich had averaged at US$17 for the decade from 2008 to 2018‚Äîwidened to a record of around US$50, and the price of WCS plummeted to US$5.90. In response, the NDP government under then-Premier Rachel Notley, had set temporary mandatory production limits which resulted in the price of WCS rose to c.US$26.65 a barrel. On March 24, 2020, as the price of oil plunged more than 5 per cent, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced a program to help the oil industry which would include a \\"backstop for banks that lend to the energy sector.\\" By March 31, 2020, the \\"federal government had already bought Trans Mountain\\" and was \\"committed to getting it built\\" and Enbridge's Line 3 was making progress. In what Kenney described as a \\"bold move to retake control of our province's economic destiny\\", the province agreed to help finance the construction of TC Energy's Keystone XL oil sands pipeline in southern Alberta, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska with \\"agreements for the transport of 575,000 barrels of oil daily\\". The New York Times reported that \\"[d]espite plunging oil prices\\" in March\\", Kenney said the \\"province's resource-dependent economy could not afford for Keystone XL to be delayed until after the coronavirus pandemic and a global economic downturn have passed.\\" Alberta \\"has agreed to invest approximately $1.1 billion US as equity in the project, which substantially covers planned construction costs through the end of 2020. The remaining $6.9 billion US is expected to be funded through a combination of a $4.2-billion project-level credit facility to be fully guaranteed by the Alberta government and a $2.7-billion investment by TC Energy.\\" Kenney has said that the Keystone XL will create \\"1,400 direct and 5,400 indirect jobs in Alberta during construction and will reap an estimated $30 billion in tax and royalty revenues for both Alberta and Canada over the next twenty years. TC Energy \\"expects to buy back the Alberta government's investment and refinance the $4.2 billion loan\\" when the 1,200-mile (1,930-kilometer) pipeline is operational starting in 2023. Keystone XL will add up to 830,000 bpd from Western Canada to Steele City, Nebraska. From there it connects to \\"other pipelines that feed oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.\\" According to the Canadian Energy Regulator, in 2018, Alberta produced 3.91 million bpd of crude oil, which represents 82 per cent of the total production in Canada. According to a March 31, 2020 article in The New York Times, because of Kenney, Russ Girling, TC Energy CEO, announced that construction of its $8-billion US Keystone XL oil sands pipeline's Canada- United States border crossing, in rural northeast Montana, will begin in April in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns were raised by the office of the Montana's Governor, Steve Bullock about the added strain on \\"rural health resources during the coronavirus pandemic\\", with the arrival of a hundred or more pipeline construction workers in rural Montana. At the time of the announcement northeastern Montana had only one confirmed COVID-19 case. As part of Government of Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, the federal government announced on May 1, 2020 that up to $1.72 billion will go to the governments of Alberta and the Alberta Orphan Well Association‚Äîas well as Saskatchewan and British Columbia‚Äîto \\"clean up\\" orphan wells and \\"inactive oil and gas infrastructure\\". According to the Alberta provincial government, Alberta's Site Rehabilitation Program \\"will access up to $1 billion\\" of the federal government's COVID-19 Plan. By May 20, Alberta had already received 24, 000 applications. In a May 20 interview on the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC) podcast, Minister Savage told the podcast host, John Bavil, said that Green party leader, Elizabeth May's May 6 comment that \\"oil is dead\\" was not \\"gaining resonance with ordinary Canadians\\" because Canadians need oil. \\"Canadians are just trying to get by.\\" 17:06 Savage added that Canadians were \\"not going to have tolerance and patience for protests that get in the way of people working\\", and that the \\"economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic favours pipeline construction\\", according to Canadian Press journalist, Bob Weber. Savage told Bavil that \\"Now is a great time to be building a pipeline because you can't have protests of more than 15 people...Let's get it built.\\" The comment received wide media coverage. Ministry of Justice In February 2020, against the backdrop of anti- pipeline rail blockades, Teck Resources \\"withdrew its application to build the $20-billion Frontier oilsands mine in Alberta. In response, on February 25, Alberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer announced the tabling of the Critical Infrastructure Defence Act (Bill 1), which will \\"impose stiff new penalties for anyone who purposefully blocks critical infrastructure including railways and roadways.\\" The Bill was in its 3rd reading in May 2020. By mid-June opposition to the legislation \\"continued to grow\\". This included an \\"online petition to withdraw the legislation\\" with 350,000 signatures. Some University of Calgary law professors critiqued Bill 1, saying that it violated freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, association, the \\"right to liberty, and the right to equality\\". On April 29, 2020, Minister Schweitzer \\"rescinded the appointments of seven public members\\" of the Provincial Court Nominating Committee (PCNC)‚Äîa committee that vets court judges in Alberta. Currently, Alberta's PCNC is composed of \\"eight government appointees and three ex- officio members\\". Schweitzer appointed Leighton Grey, Harvey Cenaiko, Pat Nelson, Christa Nicholson, and David Ross to a three-year term, to replace Mona Duckett, as well as Lise Gotell, Anne Wilson, Kanchana Fernando, and Linda Many Guns, who had been appointed by Kathleen Ganley, the former NDP justice minister, to diversify the PCNC, according to the CBC. Leighton Grey resigned from the PCNC in June 2020, after a CBC investigation revealed his \\"recent comparison of a future COVID-19 vaccine to Auschwitz tattoos and posting of a video that called Black Lives Matter a \\"leftist lie\\" controlled by a Jewish philanthropist.\\" Minister Schweitzer defended Grey, saying that PCNC members were \\"not required to surrender their right to personal views\\". In a CBC interview, the chair of Alberta's Edmonton-based Criminal Trial Lawyers' Association raised concerns about the lack of \\"adequate background checks\\", and screening candidates for PCNC membership. Kaycee Madu, who was named as Minister of Justice and Solicitor General of Alberta in August 25, 2020, said in a statement in early October, that according to the Fair Deal Panel, Albertans want a provincial police to replace the RCMP. Madu added that the establishment of a provincial police force would also limit \\"Ottawa's reach into the province,\\" which aligns with the UCP's \\"firewall\\" policy. In response to the recommendation of the Fair Deal Panel, the UCP administration hired the consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to undertake a C$2 million feasibility study of a potential transition towards a provincial police force. An October 2 statement issued by the RCMP's Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki, in response to the study, said that Alberta has 4,500 RCMP employees who work in the province and \\"proudly call\\" Alberta their home. Kathleen Ganley, New Democratic Party (NDP) justice critic, acknowledged that while there were possible merits to the proposal, she was surprised by the timing, questioning why the UCP was \\"pushing ahead during a pandemic.\\" The deficit is on track to reach a \\"record-setting $24-billion\\" and \\"public services are under strain\\". A Mount Royal University professor estimated that it would cost approximately C$110 million annually and that unlike the current system with the federal government paying 30%, the provincial government would be responsible for paying the expenses of a provincial police force as well as maintaining vehicles, building, and equipment. Ministry of Education In November 2019, the Calgary Board of Education (CBE) announced it would be cutting the positions of hundreds of teachers following the UCP 2019 cuts to the education funding in the UCP's fall budget, In response, Alberta's Education Minister Adriana LaGrange said she would launch an \\"independent financial audit\\" as well as a \\"governance review\\" of the CBE. LaGrange said that the CBE had used taxpayer dollars recklessly. She said that the \\"audit and governance review will give government a path forward on helping the CBE prioritize the classroom and find efficiencies elsewhere in its operations.\\" In early December LaGrange \\"provided a \\"one-time exception\\" on the annual $15 million \\"maintenance renewal funding\\" to the Alberta Board of Education. This allows school boards to use the funds to reverse the layoffs of 317 temporary teachers. On June 13, 2020 Demetrios Nicolaides, Alberta's Advanced Education Minister, announced that McKinsey & Company‚Äîan American consulting firm headquartered in New York with an office in Calgary‚Äîhas been commissioned to undertake a $3.7-million comprehensive review of the province's education system, including Alberta's \\"network of 26 institutions\\". Based on their findings, there could be \\"substantial changes starting in 2021\\". Ministry of Environment and Parks  On March 3, 2020, the Minister of Environment and Parks, Jason Nixon said that the province could not \\"continue to spend $86 million of Albertans' tax dollars\\" on the \\"province's parks, recreation areas and other protected areas\\"‚Äîareas that bring in only $36 million. An Alberta Parks March 5 statement entitled, \\"Optimizing Alberta Parks\\", listed changes that would come into effect in 2020 as part of a cost-saving initiative. The UCP government would \\"fully or partially close\\" \\"20 provincial parks\\" and was \\"planning to hand over 164 others to third-party managers\\". The Canadian Press said that this represents \\"more than one-third of all the province's parks, recreation areas and other protected areas.\\" The statement included the possibly of selling Crown land. In response to concerns, Nixon said in a March 5 Calgary Herald interview, \\"We are not selling any Crown or public land ‚Äî period.\\" According to a March 17 Global News article, the province listed a 65-hectare plot of land east of Taber in a March 31 auction with a starting bid of $440,000. According to documents released under the freedom of information legislation at the end of July 2020, Minister Nixon had been advised by \\"his most senior staffers\\" that prior to closing parks, he should have at least \\"two rounds of consultation\\". Nixon's office and communications told staff that \\"there would be no public input for changes\\" he was \\"planning for Alberta parks.\\" Ministry for Economic Development, Trade and Tourism By April 7, 2020, the Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism Tanya Fir, said that the technology sector would be \\"a key part of diversifying Alberta's economy.\\" Fir is reviewing recommendations in a report by an Innovation Capital Working Group, a working group of \\"tech sector, academic and business leaders\\" created by the province in December 2019, to \\"develop ways\\" to support and grow Alberta's tech sector. The UCP eliminated The Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit, the Capital Investment Tax Credit, and the Alberta Investor Tax Credit, which had provided a \\"30 per cent tax credit to investors who put money into specific industries such as clean technology and digital animation.\\" Trent Johnsen, a veteran member of Alberta's tech sector, who has been involved with Innovate Calgary among others, said that Alberta was \\"betting exclusively on oil and gas. What is Alberta doing to become a successful player in the 21st century of the new economy?\\" Ministry of Finance The Boards and Commissions and Government Enterprises Act, which was part of the November 2019 UCP budget Bill 22, presented by Finance Minister, Travis Toews, Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) became the \\"investment manager of all public sector pensions\\". Bill 22 added the Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund (ATRF) assets to other pension plans already managed by AIMCo. Minister Toews said that AIMCo had \\"provided an annual return of 9.9 per cent on Albertans' investments\\" in the decade ending in 2019. By April 2020, AIMCo was managing about \\"$119-billion on behalf of 375,000 members of provincial public retirement programs as well as public accounts such as the province's $18-billion Heritage Savings Trust Fund.\\" According to an April 21, 2020 Globe and Mail article, AIMCo lost over $4-billion during the coronavirus pandemic, by investing in stocks that were dependent on a stable market. This represents over a \\"third of AIMCo's 2019 net investment income of $11.5-billion.\\" On June 29, Premier Kenney and Minister Toews announced what Kenney called the \\"largest infrastructure build in Alberta history,\\" representing spending of $10 billion on job-creating projects, including \\"health-care facilities, pipelines, schools, drug treatment centres\\" and more. Ministry of Health =Termination of master agreement with AMA (February 20, 2020)= On February 20, Tyler Shandro, Alberta's Minister of Health announced that he was ending the province's long-standing master agreement with Alberta's physicians. The new rules, which include \\"new fee rules on extended patient visits that doctors\\", came into effect on March 30. On April 9, the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Health citing the unilateral termination of the long-standing master agreement with the Alberta government, the \\"government's conduct during negotiations\\", and Bill 21 as \\"some of the reasons for filing the claim\\". At the time of the announcement, doctors were concerned that these rules would make it unsustainable for some clinic in rural Alberta to remain in practice. Shandro said that ending the master agreement was \\"difficult but necessary\\" because of the need to cut costs in the \\"$20.6-billion health system\\". According to a survey of 300 doctors in Alberta, by July, 44 rural communities would be \\"directly affected by recent government changes to the way physicians can bill for services\\". By April 21, Sundre, Stettler and Lac La Biche had \\"already been informed some of their doctors will be withdrawing emergency and obstetric services in hospitals.\\" Although Minister Shandro first responded to concerns that doctors would leave rural Alberta, by promising to quickly replace them, by April 20, Shandro's press secretary acknowledged that rural communities \\"face long- standing challenges in recruiting and retaining physicians\\" and announced that they were \\"preparing to announce changes to support rural physicians very soon.\\" =Babylon= In early March Minister Shandro announced an amendment to the billing code for doctors in the province, capping their fees at \\"$20 a call to provide COVID-19 telephone advice to patients.\\" With physical distancing COVID-19 protocols in place, Alberta's physicians had been asking Minister Shandro to make it easier for them to provide care for their own patients virtually. On March 16, Minister Shandro announced that the provincial government had \\"signed an agreement\\" with Telus Health, \\"a new virtual health care support, called the TELUS Health Babylon app‚Äîa private initiative. At that time, Alberta doctors expressed shock and dismay that the UCP government had brought in Babylon, a private initiative by Telus Health. In a March 21 interview with Postmedia, Alberta Medical Association President, Christine Molnar, said \\"Physicians are under extreme strain. Not only have doctors had their master agreement terminated by the province and face changes to the way they are supported financially and can provide services but they also don't have a billing code implemented that allows them to provide virtual care in their offices...On top of all that, they are facing possible ‚Äî actually, certain exposure directly to a deadly virus...Physicians are feeling devalued, disenfranchised and unsupported.\\" On April 21, Alberta's Information and Privacy Commissioner, Jill Clayton, announced that her office was \\"launching two investigations\\" into the controversial Babylon app by Telus Health.\\" Concerns about \\"privacy compliance\\" had emerged following the Commissioner's review of a May 2019 privacy impact assessments (PIA) submitted by Babylon Health Canada Limited and the second PIA submitted by a Calgary- area physician. Minister Shandro welcomed the review. Minister of Labour and Immigration In May 2019, the UCP government created a two-tier minimum wage which allowed businesses to pay teen students $13 an hour starting on June 26, 2019, which Kenney had promised in March as part of his election campaign. In response to a UCP campaign pledge that questioned the hike in the minimum wage from \\"$10.20 in 2015 to $15 in 2018\\" under the NDP government, the Minister of Labour and Immigration, Jason Copping created a 9-person panel led by Joseph Marchand, a University of Alberta economist, to review minimum wage in August 2019. Critics questioned the number of panelists from industries that would benefit from having a lower minimum wage, and the presence of one waiter on the panel who was related to one of the restaurant owner panelists. Minister of Community and Social Services (CSS) According to a September 12 Calgary Herald based on a Postmedia report, a senior source within the CSS department‚Äîwho spoke on the \\"condition of anonymity\\"‚Äîconfirmed that there was a \\"push to potentially make some cuts‚Äù to Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) , that 69,785 depend on. The source said that the cuts would \\"not be minor\\"‚Äîthey would be \\"significant.\\" In response to the report, on the afternoon of September 11, 2020, Rajan Sawhney, Minister of Community and Social Services, posted a statement on on her Facebook account, saying that \\"there have been no changes to program eligibility, benefits, or program funding\\" to the AISH program. The next morning, September 12, 2020, on Facebook, she addressed \\"those of you who have had a sleepless night, due to the stress of yesterday‚Äôs news\\", saying \\"let me provide you with some reassurance... let me state definitively that there will be no cuts to AISH financial benefits.\\" The UCP's decision to de-index AISH benefits announced in the 2019 budget was poorly received in October 2019. Infrastructure On June 1, 2020 Prime Minister Trudeau announced that the federal government will advance the 2020-21 federal Gas Tax Fund in a single payment of $2.2 billion in June to \\"3,600 communities across Canada\\", instead of spreading the payment over the year, to help cities \\"cover COVID-19-prompted budget shortfalls.\\" Alberta municipalities responded that this is not enough, and they wrote to Premier Kenney \\"asking the province to work with Ottawa to find emergency funding.\\" On June 19, Premier Kenney and Transportation Minister Ric McIver announced that the province will \\"spend another $200 million on municipal infrastructure projects\\", earmarked for \\"local transportation infrastructure and waterworks projects.\\" It is anticipated that this will create \\"thousands of jobs\\".  Technical and Corporate Services =Issues Manager= The Kenney administration created a new position entitled issues manager, reporting to the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) of Technical and Corporate Services. The issues manager identifies and manages both \\"strategic and operational issues\\" based on the UCP's \\"policies, procedures and processes\\". In August 2019, Premier Kenney hired Matt Wolf as issues manager, a position he had held during the premiership of then Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. Wolf had previously worked for the UCP as chief of staff. Wolf also worked in the private sector for Sun News Network from 2011 to 2015. Matt was implicated in the so-called 2017 \\"kamikaze\\" campaign against Brian Jean but has denied any wrongdoing. In March 2019, just prior to the provincial election, the Edmonton Journal had revealed internal emails that showed collaboration between Wolf and Jeff Callaway's campaign, through Cameron Davies, Callaway's co-campaign manager. The leaked documents included regular communication between Davies and Wolf discussing \\"ads and memes, research, timelines of ad drops, strategy tips\\" \\"talking points\\", \\"speaking notes, message planning, graphics and videos\\". Lorne Gibson, then Alberta's elections commissioner, had investigated Callaway's campaign in which he had allegedly served as a \\"kamikaze\\" candidate for Kenney. By November 2019, just after Gibson had handed out 15 fines against 15 people totalling C$207,223, which included a C$15,000 levied against Davies, Gibson's position as commissioner was eliminated by the UCP administration. The RCMP has continued its investigation. In April 2020, Kenney and other UCP members were cleared in an ethics probe. The Ethics commissioner wrote in her report that \\"it appears Matt Wolf, a senior staff member in the premier's office, may have been involved in some \\"questionable political shenanigans\\" but said there is no evidence to suggest the premier knew about them.\\" Office of the Ethics Commissioner Ethics Commissioner, Marguerite Trussler, cleared Premier Kenney and UCP staff in a conflict of interest investigation against Premier Kenney, Doug Schweitzer, Jason Nixon and others, over the firing of Lorne Gibson, Alberta's election commissioner in November. Response to COVID-19 pandemic In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Premier Kenney declared a state of emergency on March 17, which gives the province or the provincial health authority the right to \\"acquire or use property, require a qualified person to help out, authorize the conscription of people needed or authorize the entry into buildings or onto land without a warrant\\" under the Public Health Act. Although the order may lapse after 30 days, it can be renewed. Ontario and British Columbia also declared a state of emergency as the number of cases increased. By March 17, there were 23 new cases representing the \\"largest day-over-day increase yet in the province\\" resulting in total of 97 people in Alberta with the virus. Confirmed cases across the province include 20 in the Calgary zone, 20 in the Edmonton zone, 3 in the Central zone, 1 in the South zone, and 3 in the North zone. Premier Kenney set out the UCP government's COVID-19 strategy to Albertans in his April 7th address from the Cabinet room in the Legislature‚Äî\\"Protecting lives and livelihoods\\". In a call for unity, he cited former American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the architect of 1933 New Deal: \\"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of (our) unity.\\" He cited Preston Manning, \\"In a fierce prairie storm, he said, cattle often get spooked, turn tail, and try to run from it, getting separated and lost. But the buffalo, which Indigenous people have always revered as a symbol of life on the prairies, herd closely together and face the storm head on, coming out of it strong and united.\\" On July 21, Education Minister, Adriana LaGrange and Premier Kenney announced that schools \\"will open in September at near-normal operations with protections in place to limit the spread of the virus, including extra cleaning, hand sanitization and reorganizing classrooms to allow for more space.\\" On July 24, 2020 Premier Kenney retweeted that he found Danielle Smith's Calgary Herald opinion piece entitled \\"Let's get kids back to class and protect those really at risk\\", an interesting perspective. Public Sector Compensation Transparency Act On November 27, 2019, the Alberta government published the \\"political staff salaries and contracts\\" as required by the Public Sector Compensation Transparency Act, also known as the \\"Sunshine List\\". According to their website, most of the salaries fall below the disclosure threshold, which was $111,395 in 2019. Medicine Hat News reported that 14 of Kenney's political staff salaries were above the threshold‚Äî2 were over $224,000, four were about $200,000, and the rest were more than $114,000. The total is over $2.9 million. Kenney had cut his own annual salary in 2019 to about $186,000. The Alberta director for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Franco Terrazzano, called these salaries \\"eye-popping.\\" Public response to Kenney's premiership A March 3 CBC article listed the reasons for Kenney's drop in the polls to 47 per cent in March 2020 approving his overall performance from 60 per cent in September 2019. In the March polls, forty-six per cent of Albertan's approved of Notley's performance. This included the blockades as well as the UCP's \\"aggressive approach to bolster the province's oil and gas sector and balance the budget through cuts\\". Other controversial actions taken by the UCP include, \\"cutting funding for post-secondary institutions while lifting the tuition cap\\"; \\"reducing funding to municipalities; \\"imposing unilateral changes to the way doctors bill the province; making clear it wants freezes or cuts to government employees' pay when collective agreements come up for negotiation this spring; spending $30 million per year on a war room now called the Canadian Energy Centre; making its first bill of the new sitting one that targets those who disrupt critical infrastructure with severe penalties; and \\"fully or partially closing 20 provincial parks and seeking \\"partnerships\\" for 164 more.\\" Polling results In the February 24 to February 28 Angus Reid Institute poll, Kenney's approval rate among Albertans had dropped to 47 per cent from 54 per cent in December 2019 and 60 per cent in September 2019. In September he was one of the top-three most-popular premiers in Canada with only Permier Moe of Saskatchewan and Quebec's Fran√ßois Legault winning higher approval ratings by a small margin. According to a ThinkHQ Public Affairs Inc. poll released on December 16, 2019, Albertans who disapprove of the performance of the UCP government were in the majority at 53 per cent, which reflects a \\"considerable slide in public approval\\" since October. Of the respondents who voted for the UCP in spring, 21 per cent disapproved of Kenney by December 16. In ThinkHQ's poll the opposition to the UCP was \\"considerably more intense than support\\"‚Äî38 per cent said they strongly disapproved with only 16 per cent strong approving. Reasons for the slide in popularity by December 2019, included growing concerns about both employment and the economy with \\"many voters\\" concerned with the \\"unexpected consequences related to budget-tightening by the new Kenney government.\\" A late May 2020 Research Co. poll of Canadian provinces, found that 56 per cent of those polled did not want Kenney as Premier. Kenney's s disapproval rating with the highest of all the regions polled. In spite of a \\"drop in his approval numbers\\", forty-six per cent of Albertans, polled in May 2020 by CBC News-Road Ahead, say they would \\"vote for Jason Kenney's UCP.\\". According to Mount Royal University political science professor, Duane Bratt, Kenney's poll numbers reflect the UCP's \\"clash with doctors over pay\\" during the pandemic. A CBC News-Road Ahead survey led by Pollster Janet Brown completed by June 1, 2020, found that most Albertans approved the federal, provincial and municipal governments' responses to the pandemic. Seventy per cent of Albertans approved the provincial government's response and 62 per cent approved of the federal government's response. While Kenney did not receive the COVID bump in premiers ratings experienced by other premiers and the prime minister, in June 2020, Kenney still has the support needed to win the next election. His approval rating for his response to the pandemic is the lowest in Canada, falling to 67 per cent in April to 51 per cent in August. According to an Angus Reid Institute poll undertaken from August 26 to 30, 2020, only about 42% of respondents said that Premier Kenney was \\"doing a good job.\\" The Angus Reid report on the poll said that, \\"Albertans have grown increasingly critical\\" of Premier Kenney and the UCP \\"government‚Äôs response to the coronavirus, and the province‚Äôs finances are in historically poor shape with oil revenues plummeting and pandemic-related economic shocks persisting.‚Äù List of premiers Notes See also *30th Alberta Legislature *Alberta Energy Regulator *Alberta Geological Survey *Alberta Health Services *Alberta Human Rights Commission *Alberta Municipal Government Board *Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority *Alberta Parks *Economy of Alberta References External links * Premier of Alberta Official Site * Category:Premiers of Alberta Category:Premierships Category:Politics of Alberta Category:Alberta Legislature Category:Alberta provincial legislation Category:2019 in Alberta ","title":"Premiership of Jason Kenney"},{"id":"62178619","text":"47th Street is an album by the American jazz trumpeter Malachi Thompson released by the Delmark label in 1998.Jazzlists: Delmark Records discography: 400/500 series accessed October 14, 2019Delmark Records: album details accessed October 14, 2019Jazzlists: Carter Jefferson discography accessed October 14, 2019Jazzlists: Billy Harper discography accessed October 28, 2019 The album formed part of Thompson's efforts to revitalize the Sutherland Hotel one of the last remaining links to the 47th Street Jazz Scene in Chicago.Another blow to low-cost housing, Chicago Tribune, August 11, 2010 Reception Allmusic reviewer Tim Sheridan stated \\"Thompson's terrific ode to a unique time and place in African-American history is filled with exciting musical ideas while also remaining accessible\\".

From 1918 to 1925 he taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences; from 1925 to 1930 ‚Äì at the Faculty of Ethnology; since 1934 ‚Äì at the Faculty of History (head of the commission on the history of the pre-class society at the Department of the History of the Ancient World), professor of the Department of Ancient History of the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History. From 1942 to 1953 he was the head of the Department of Ancient History of the Moscow Regional Pedagogical Institute and professor of the Department of General History of the Moscow State Historical and Archival Institute. His first published studies, begun in his student years, were devoted to the Zemsky Sobors in Russia in the 17th century. However, the main area of his scientific interests was the history of primitive society and the early forms of religion. Numerous articles and brochures are mainly of a popular scientific nature, devoted to the problems of anthropogenesis, the origin and early forms of religion. In 1926 he was on a business trip to Europe, where he studied modern literature about early forms of religion in libraries. In the same year he published a large article in the magazine ¬´Antireligioznik¬ª, devoted to various theories of the origin of religion, where he devoted considerable attention to criticism of the theory of urmonotheismus, and in 1929 he made a large report on this subject at the Communist Academy. In the late 1920s to the early 1930s, under his editorship and with his preface, translations of the works of European scholars on the history of culture and primitive religion (Heinrich Cunow ¬´The History of the Economy¬ª, Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl ¬´Supernatural in Primitive Thinking¬ª, Edward Burnett Tylor ¬´Primitive Culture¬ª, James George Frazer ¬´The Golden Bough¬ª), were published at ¬´Ateist¬ª and ¬´Sotsekgiz¬ª publishing houses.

Currently, Paste holds the 28th rank on Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2019, and the 31st rank on the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2019. Early life and career Prior to the opening of Paste, Satongun spent years researching the history of Thai cuisine, re-creating ancient recipes and culinary techniques alongside chef, husband and business partner, Jason Bailey. Both Satongun and Bailey had humble beginnings, from Satongun's childhood memories of pounding herbs with pestle on mortar to assist her mother's street food stall business in Bangkok, to Bailey's experiences growing up in the Southern Highlands of Australia. She met her husband on one of his earlier research trips to Thailand. Paste Bangkok In 2012, Satongun and Bailey opened their first Paste restaurant in the neighborhood of Thonglor. In 2015, they opened a new iteration of Paste in Gaysorn shopping mall, located in Bangkok's Ratchaprasong district adjacent to the Intercontinental Hotel. At Paste, dishes represent regional Thai cuisine, taking inspiration from ancient Thai recipes and royal family cookbooks. Chef Bee hopes to do away with the notion of Thai food as 'cheap takeaway', and re- frame the cuisine in the minds of her diners. In 2018, Paste Bangkok was awarded its first Michelin star in the inaugural Michelin Guide Bangkok. Paste Bangkok retained its one-Michelin-star rating in 2019. As of 2020, it retains its one Michelin star. Other restaurants and pursuits In 2018, Satongun and Bailey opened their first overseas branch of Paste, Paste Laos at the Apsara in the UNESCO World Heritage-listed ancient town of Luang Prabang.

On All About Jazz Jack Bowers said \\"Thompson states in his liner notes that Free-bop \\"takes the most exciting elements of bop and combines [them] with the exploratory aspects of avant-garde jazz,\\" which seems a more accurate description of his band's purpose. Thus Free-bop strives to broaden the parameters of Jazz without abandoning the music's customary precepts of order and discipline. It is \\"free\\" only in the sense that Thompson and his colleagues seek to rearrange the basic building blocks of bop and upraise them to a new and more exciting plane. In fact, the Free-bop Band sounds for the most part much like many other bop-based groups who try as best they can to communicate within the vernacular ...

The units personnel enlisted for six months in 1862, but during its brief service it participated in the battles of Second Bull Run, Chantilly, South Mountain, and Antietam. The battery was mustered out on 29 November 1862, having lost one enlisted man killed in action and 10 men dead of disease. Service The 8th Massachusetts Battery was organized at North Cambridge, Massachusetts on 24 June 1862 for a six-month enlistment. The battery left Massachusetts and arrived in Washington, D.C. on 27 June. It served in Samuel D. Sturgis's Reserve Corps in the Military District of Washington through August. For the remainder of its career, the 8th Massachusetts Battery served in the 1st Division, IX Corps. The battery was mustered out on 29 November 1862, having lost one enlisted man killed in action and 10 men dead of disease. History The 8th Massachusetts battery remained in camp near Fairfax Seminary, Virginia from 1 July to 8 August 1862. It moved first to Alexandria, Virginia and then to Aquia Creek and Falmouth, Virginia during 8‚Äì11 August. The battery participated in Pope's Campaign in Northern Virginia from 16 August to 2 September. It fought at Groveton on 29 August, Second Bull Run on 30 August, Chantilly on 1 September, South Mountain on 14 September, and Antietam on 16‚Äì17 September 1862. During the Second Battle of Bull Run and campaign, the 8th Massachusetts Battery under Captain Asa M. Cook and 2nd U.S. Artillery, Battery E under Samuel Nicholl Benjamin were part of Isaac Stevens's division in the IX Corps. The corps was led by Jesse L. Reno. Stevens's division consisted of six infantry regiments organized into three brigades. Cook's and Benjamin's batteries reported losses of three killed and 10 wounded during the campaign. The Battle of Chantilly was fought in a rainstorm. Learning that a Confederate column under Stonewall Jackson was trying to turn the Federal right flank, John Pope sent Reno's corps and other units to intercept it. Stevens was killed during the action. The 8th Massachusetts and Benjamin's batteries were part of Orlando B. Willcox's 1st Division at the Battle of South Mountain on 14 September. About 2:00 pm, Willcox's division reinforced Jacob Dolson Cox's Kanawha Division which was skirmishing with Confederate forces. Willcox deployed his troops on Cox's right and drawn back at an angle like an inverted V. A section of Cook's 8th Massachusetts Battery unlimbered at the apex of the angle, about from the summit. These guns dueled with John Lane's Confederate battery for a short time before one gun was disabled. Another gun was moving up to replace the damaged piece when James W. Bondurant's Confederate battery suddenly opened a heavy fire from a distance of . Cook's limber drivers panicked and rode to the rear through the lines of the 17th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. While some of the gun crews also fled, Cook and others maintained their position, sustaining losses of one killed and four wounded. Finally, Cook ordered his men to withdraw into the woods, abandoning the guns. Soon afterward, Willcox's troops advanced and drove the Confederate infantry back. Cook's guns were recovered and the battery again opened fire on Confederate troops near Turner's Gap. Later in the action Cook's and Independent Battery D, Pennsylvania Light Artillery (George W. Durell's) silenced Lane's battery. Map shows the fighting around Burnside's Bridge. At the Battle of Antietam on 17 September, the 8th Massachusetts Battery was commanded by Cook. The unit now counted four officers and 122 enlisted men and sustained one man wounded during the action. The battery's armament consisted of four 12-pounder James rifles and two M1841 12-pounder howitzers. During the assault on Burnside's Bridge, the 8th Massachusetts and six other batteries pounded the Confederate defensive position. Initially, Cook's battery took a position south of the bridge on the east side of Antietam Creek and fired on Benjamin F. Eshleman's Confederate battery. The Federal batteries were unable to suppress the opposing artillery file until the Union infantry seized a bridgehead. At that time, 4th U.S. Artillery, Battery E (Joseph C. Clark's), 5th U.S. Artillery, Battery A (Charles P. Muhlenberg's), and Durell's battery crossed the creek, followed by Cook's battery. The batteries moved west about to the ridge crest to support the infantry's advance. Cook's and Clark's batteries advanced to the J. Otto house in support of Willcox's division. A section of the 8th Massachusetts battery under Lieutenant John N. Coffin advanced in front of the infantry and came under close range fire from Confederate guns. In the late afternoon several of A. P. Hill's brigades reached the field and began attacking the Union left flank. The soldiers of John Gregg's brigade, wearing captured blue uniforms, tricked some Federal units by calling out, \\"Cease fire, you are firing upon your own men\\". Hugh Boyle Ewing's Union brigade marched into this confused situation and was mistakenly targeted by Cook's battery and Federal infantry, which caused friendly fire casualties. Later, Coffin's section of two 12-pounder howitzers disrupted the 35th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment as it retreated through its ranks. Soon after, Coffin's section took post on the right flank of the 35th Massachusetts and helped it hold its position. One of Coffin's shells exploded next to a gun in David G. McIntosh's Confederate battery, mortally wounding a gunner. The battery remained at Antietam Creek until 6 October 1862. It moved to Washington, D.C. to refit on 5‚Äì9 October. From the capital, the unit marched to Pleasant Valley, Maryland from 21 to 26 October. Its final movement was to Falmouth from 26 October to 19 November, where the unit was mustered out.

It was developed secretly as a rocket fuel oxidiser. Production Chlorine oxide trifluoride was originally made at Rocketdyne by treating chlorine monoxide with fluorine. Other substances that could react with fluorine to make it includes sodium chlorite (NaClO2), and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). The first published production method was a reaction of chlorine monoxide with oxygen difluoride (OF2). Yet other production methods are reactions between ClO2F or ClO3F and chlorine fluorides. A safer approach is the use chlorine nitrate with fluorine. Reactions As a Lewis base it can lose a fluoride ion to Lewis acids, yielding the difluorooxychloronium(V) cation (ClOF2+). Compounds with this include: ClOF2BF4, ClOF2PF6, ClOF2AsF6, ClOF2SbF6, ClOF2BiF6, ClOF2VF6, ClOF2NbF6, ClOF2TaF6, ClOF2UF6, ClOF2, (ClOF2)2SiF6, ClOF2MoOF5, ClOF2Mo2O4F9, ClOF2PtF6. Functioning as a Lewis acid, it can gain a fluoride ion from a strong base to yield a tetrafluorooxychlorate(V) anion: ClOF4‚àí ion. These include KClOF4, RbClOF4, and CsClOF4. This allows purification of ClOF3, as at room temperature a solid complex is formed, but this decomposes between 50 and 70 ¬∞C. Other likely impurities either will not react with alkali fluoride, or if they do will not easily decompose. Chlorine trifluoride oxide fluoridates various materials such as chlorine monoxide, chlorine, glass or quartz. ClOF3 \\\\+ Cl2O ‚Üí 2ClF + ClO2F; 2ClOF3 \\\\+ 2Cl2 ‚Üí 6ClF + O2 at 200 ¬∞C Chlorine trifluoride oxide adds to chlorine fluorosulfate, ClOF3 \\\\+ 2ClOSO2F ‚Üí S2O5F2 \\\\+ FClO2 \\\\+ 2ClF. The reaction also produces SO2F2. Chlorine trifluoride oxide can fluoridate and add oxygen in the same reaction, reacting with molybdenum pentafluoride, silicon tetrafluoride, tetrafluorohydrazine (over 100 ¬∞C), HNF2, and F2NCOF. From HNF2 the main result was NF3O. From MoF5, the results were MoF6 and MoOF4. It reacts explosively with hydrocarbons. With small amounts of water, ClO2F is formed along with HF. Over 280 ¬∞C ClOF3 decomposes to oxygen and chlorine trifluoride. Properties The boiling point of chlorine trifluoride oxide is 29 ¬∞C. The shape of the molecule is a trigonal bipyramid, with two fluorine atoms at the top and bottom (apex) (Fa) and an electron pair, oxygen and fluorine (Fe) on the equator. The Cl=O bond length is 1.405 √Ö, Cl-Fe 1.603 √Ö, other Cl-Fa 1.713 √Ö, ‚à†FeClO=109¬∞ ‚à†FaClO=95¬∞, ‚à†FaClFe=88¬∞.

It is operated by the Genesee County Parks and Recreation Commission alongside the Huckleberry Railroad. Initially proposed as a Flint River recreational area and a farm museum, it was opened as a historical village in 1976. Crossroads Village is home to 34 buildings, many which are restored 19th-century buildings, as well as amusement rides, a narrow-gauge railroad, and a replica paddlewheel steamboat. It also hosts numerous events and festivals throughout the year. The village is located at 6140 Bray Road in Genesee Township. History Church at Crossroads Village The City of Flint drew up a master plan in 1950 that included an upstream Flint River recreational area. In 1965, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation offered land- purchasing financial assistance with conditions, including establishing a commission. Thus, Genesee County formed its Parks and Recreation Commission the following year. A farm museum was proposed for the area. Additionally, residents concerned about the loss of historical buildings as the county developed met to discuss the issue. The result was that the farm museum would have a historical village adjacent to it with donated buildings moved there. Crossroads Village and the Huckleberry Railroad opened on July 4, 1976. Alberti Flea Circus at Crossroads Village Starting in 2018, the Sloan Auto Fair was moved from the Flint Cultural Center to the village as a result of the Flint Institute of Arts' expansion. On April 23, 2020, Genesee County Parks Director Barry June announced that Crossroads Village and the Huckleberry Railroad would not open for the 2020 summer season due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. A late opening was planned in October 2020. It was the first time that the park had been forced to delay opening since it was first opened in 1976.  Attractions  Crossroads Village is home to 34 buildings, many which are restored 19th-century buildings: it includes the oldest operating gristmill in Michigan as well as a barbershop, blacksmith shop, cider mill, and general store. The T.N. North and Son Bank was moved from Vassar and the town hall was moved from Clayton Township. Crossroads Village is also home to amusement rides, the narrow-gauge Huckleberry Railroad, and replica paddlewheel steamboat Genesee Bell, the latter of which both operate along Mott Lake. Amusement rides at Crossroads Village include a CW Parker Superior Wheel (a Ferris wheel) built in 1910, a Charles W. Parker Carousel built in 1912, Venetian swings, and pony carts. The carousel was built in Leavenworth, Kansas, installed in California for 30 years, and purchased by a private collector in Michigan before it was acquired by Crossroads Village with a $175,000 grant from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation in 1983. In 2010, Michigan History magazine named the carousel the \\"happiest place in Genesee County\\". = Huckleberry Railroad = D&RGW; #464 on the Huckleberry Railroad The Huckleberry Railroad is a narrow-gauge railroad that runs from Crossroads Village alongside Mott Lake on former Pere Marquette track.

The game follows the character of Ophelia from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. In Elsinore, Ophelia has a vision of the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle and relives the same four days again and again as she works to prevent the tragedy that will fall over everyone. Development on Elsinore took over seven years, and was created on nights and weekends by its development team. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who noted that fans of Hamlet would appreciate it but that the game's slow pace could be sometimes frustrating. Gameplay Laertes and Hamlet duel as Ophelia watches. The journal and other ways the player can see what is happening in Elsinore Castle are found in the top left, while a map shows Ophelia's current location in the top right. Elsinore is a point-and-click adventure game based on William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. The player controls the character of Ophelia as she experiences a time loop leading up to the tragedy at the end of the play. During the four days leading up to those events, the player moves Ophelia throughout Elsinore Castle and talks with its residents in order to manipulate the outcome of events. The conversations the player has leads to unforeseen outcomes in which tragedy still occurs in other ways‚Äîevery time Ophelia dies, the time loop begins again, four days before the end of Hamlet. To manipulate events, the player talks to the castle's residents about events that they have witnessed or expect to occur. The game provides a \\"Hearsay\\" menu, which shows which topics can be broached. As Ophelia goes through multiple loops and witnesses scenes, she remembers these when she wakes up again and can bring them up to other characters. The game includes a branching timeline that shows the player possibilities they can be aware of, showing both the location of an event to happen and the time of it. Outside of Ophelia's deaths, the game has 13 unique endings that change based on the player's choices throughout the game. Plot The plot of Hamlet revolves around the Danish court of the recently deceased King Hamlet. Denmark fears that an invasion from Prince Fortinbras of Norway could be imminent. Prince Hamlet, son of the recently deceased king and nephew to King Claudius, meets his father's ghost. The ghost reveals that he was murdered by Claudius and makes Hamlet vow to avenge his death. Believing him to be Claudius, Halmet accidentally kills Polonius, enraging Polonius' son, Laertes. After an attempt to kill Hamlet fails, Claudius and Laertes plot to murder him in a duel by using a poisoned sword and poison in the prince's drink. Ophelia, Laertes' sister, drowns. Hamlet returns for Ophelia's funeral and gets into a fight with Laertes. Hamlet and Laertes duel, and through various means both of them die along with Claudius and Queen Gertrude. Fortinbras arrives as Hamlet's heir and takes the crown of Denmark. Elsinore begins with a vision of the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle, similar to the play's ending. Ophelia manipulates events to achieve a different outcome. If the player does nothing, the events unfold as in the play and everyone dies. After Ophelia's first death, a time loop begins here she wakes up at the moment of Hamlet where Prince Hamlet is behaving erratically in her room. Ophelia's actions directly affect the plot in sometimes unpredictable ways. If Ophelia continually talks to people in Elsinore castle about the supernatural dreams she has been having, the characters will send Ophelia off to an institution because they are convinced she has gone insane. In order to convince Hamlet to ally with Ophelia and to have him trust her with his plot, the player must search Queen Gertrude's chambers for evidence that she was not complicit with the murder of her late husband. By confronting King Claudius with evidence that he has murdered Queen Gertrude, Claudius arranges a private meeting with Ophelia and murders her. The game enlarges Ophelia and Laertes' roles, and adds additional characters such as Othello, and Peter Quince from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Quince replaces the acting troupe from Hamlet, and is one of the few characters that is aware of Ophelia's time loop. Several characters have also been adapted for the game, making Rosencrantz and Guildenstern female and Ophelia and Laertes are biracial with experience of racial discrimination. A lady-in-waiting named Brit and a cook round out a more gender balanced cast. Development In Hamlet, Ophelia has no agency and drowns herself at the end of Act 4, making her an apt choice as the player character in Elsinore. Team lead and writer Katie Chironis and game designer Connor Fallon originally met in Carnegie Mellon's Game Creation Society. Development of Elsinore began in 2010. Chironis and Fallon originally created Elsinore as part of a game jam, scrapped the project entirely, and then decided to create it from the ground up again. Chironis was inspired to make a Hamlet game by both her high school Shakespeare teacher and from the college writing classes she took at Carnegie Mellon. Chironis and Fallon wanted to create a game that would have a tragic story but in an interactive medium, eschewing the \\"power fantasy\\" games that are commonly created. By combining the tragedy of the play with the goal of \\"winning\\" games, the development team thought they could have a fresh take on Hamlet. Chironis and Fallon created their company, Golden Glitch, with five others that had been part of the Game Creation Society, and worked on the project during nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs. The founders received no payment until after the game went on sale, and the team's four contractors were paid from their personal salaries from their other jobs. In 2015, Golden Glitch created a Kickstarter for Elsinore, which was successfully funded and raised over $32,000. Despite an original targeted release date of September 2016, the game was not released until 2019. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask provided inspiration for how to implement time loops in the game, and Golden Glitch drew inspiration from anime and visual novels which had many examples of time loops as a plot mechanic. Golden Glitch decided to focus on Ophelia as the protagonist because of her lack of agency in Hamlet. Her early exit by suicide in the play means that she is uninvolved in much of the action that comes later on, and it gave the development team room to try to make her a stronger character. The team also decided to make Opheila a woman of color, and created her with the idea that she was of Moorish descent through her mother's line. The writers believed that this modification and some others allowed them to ensure that all of the characters had more fleshed out and unique storylines. Reception Praise for the game was centered especially on the writing, and the mostly perceived success of adapting Hamlet towards a video game medium. Wireds Julie Muncy praised Elsinore for its \\"beautiful writing\\" and \\"humanistic flourishes\\". The Los Angeles Timess Todd Martens commented positively on the game's parallels with modern experiences. Polygons Cass Marshall compared the game positively to Long Live the Queen, but noted that unlike in that game, Elsinores mechanics meant that progress always felt positive, praising the deep levels of character that can be explored. GameSpots Phil Hornshaw listed the game in GameSpots \\"Best of 2019: Editor's Spotlight Awards\\" and praised the game for being full of \\"well-executed ideas\\". Criticism for the game's long waiting periods was tempered by feelings on the overall game. Kotakus Heather Alexandra noted that the slow pace \\"wouldn't be for everyone\\" but felt that if players could make it through it, the game was a worthwhile experience. US Gamers Eric Van Allen noted that the waiting periods can \\"grate\\" after a while, but that the game was largely successful in creating a positive narrative experience. =Accolades= The game was nominated for \\"Excellence in Design\\" and \\"Excellence in Narrative\\" at the IGF Awards, and for \\"Best Original Choral Composition\\", \\"Best Original Song\\" with \\"Fair as a Rose\\", and \\"Best Original Soundtrack Album\\" at the 18th Annual G.A.N.G.

Background  Maryla Wolska Wac≈Çaw Wolski Aniela Pawlikowska was born to a family with a rich literary and scientific heritage. Her mother was Maryla Wolska, a Polish poet, the daughter of Wanda M≈Çodnicka, n√©e Monn√©, muse and fianc√©e of the painter Artur Grottger, herself a writer and translator. Her father was , engineer, inventor, author on mathematical logic, linguist, an early pioneer of the Polish petroleum industry, and associate of the Canadian petroleum entrepreneur, William Henry McGarvey. Aniela was the youngest of five children. Her older sister was the writer and poet, Beata Oberty≈Ñska. Aniela was home-schooled. One of her tutors was a family friend, the university professor of philosophy and psychology and artist, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Witwicki. Aniela (\\"Lela\\") Wolska's artistic talent was noted early; she held her first solo exhibition at age nine. On that occasion, 54 of her works were exhibited by the Lw√≥w Society of Friends of Fine Art (Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Sztuk Piƒôknych). Her home education did not conclude with a matriculation examination, so she attended lectures on the history of art given at Lw√≥w University by Professors Bo≈Çoz-Antoniewicz and as an auditor. The villa \\"Pod Jedlami\\" (\\"The Firs\\") in Zakopane In 1924 Lela Wolska married , a bibliophile, writer, and publisher. She joined him at the family seat of Medyka, near Przemy≈õl. They had three daughters and a son. The family would also spend a lot of time at their mountain chalet, \\"Pod Jedlam\\" (\\"The Firs\\"), in Zakopane. It had been designed for Micha≈Ç's father, , by the modernist artist, Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz. With her husband's active support she continued her studies in art at the Krakow Academy of Fine Arts with Wojciech Weiss and Kazimierz Sichulski. In the 1930s she exhibited widely in Lw√≥w, Krak√≥w, Warsaw and Zakopane and abroad in Leipzig, Rome, Florence and Turin. With the outbreak of World War II she took her four small children to Lw√≥w where she went to live with her sister in the Wolski villa, known as \\"Za≈õwiecie\\". In May 1940 already after the first wave of Soviet deportations of Poles to Siberia, she managed to get a Laissez-passer for herself and the children into the Nazi General Government. They were taken in by a relative, the political activist and poet , on her estate in Goszyce. In April 1942, thanks to her husband's intervention, he was then in Rome, she was able to travel to Italy to join him. In Rome she provided for the family by painting portraits of Italian aristocrats and diplomats stationed there. It was also a time of family tragedy when the Pawlikowskis' second daughter died of leukemia. By the end of 1946 the family had moved to London to join the thousands of demobilised allied Polish military personnel who were allowed to settle in the United Kingdom, now that their homeland had been given over to Soviet Ukraine as part of the Yalta Accord. In London she continued to support the family through portrait commissions so that she became one of the most sought after portrait painters in the country. In 1955 her popularity led to a solo exhibition at London's Parsons Gallery which was deemed one of the cultural events of the year, not least among the Polish emigrant community. Among her sitters were Princess Alexandra of Kent, the daughters of the King of Spain and the wartime SOE agent, Krystyna Skarbek.Clare Mulley, The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II, Macmillan, 2012. p. 321 . She continued to work virtually to the end of her life, despite losing the sight in one eye. From 1962 she would visit Poland for several months each year and stay in Zakopane in the family chalet. Her husband was killed in a road traffic accident in 1970. She died in 1980 in a Polish care home, \\"Antokol\\" on the outskirts of London. Her ashes were laid to rest in Poland. Obituary in the Bulletin of the Lw√≥w Circle =The fate of Medyka= After the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the village of Medyka, and therefore the Pawlikowski estate, found themselves annexed by the Soviet Union. With 1948 border adjustments between the new Polish People's Republic and its neighbour, Medyka found itself once again just over the Polish side of the new border. The Pawlikowski estate became state property and was turned into a State Agricultural Farm (PGR). In the 1960s it was decided to demolish the palace on the grounds that it was a vestige of the earlier \\"bourgeois hegemony\\". Fortunately, the family had taken the precaution at the outbreak of war to donate part of its valuable collections to the Ossolineum in Lw√≥w and to take other parts to their chalet in Zakopane. The gamble paid off, as most of the archive managed to survive in scattered form. Pawlikowska and the family never returned to Medyka after the war to see the devastation of the place where they had spent the happiest time of their lives. It was a fate shared by the totality of Polish landowners in the Kresy region of Poland and marked a \\"caesura\\" in history and the obliteration not only of a way of life, but also of a centuries-old hugely rich and diverse cultural heritage centred on the city of Lw√≥w.  Works  Given Pawlikowska's creativity may be defined by her highly traditional and conservative background, undoubtedly influenced by her husband's, patriotic and nationalistic views, as the main champion of her work, at a time of deep crisis for the nation coupled with exile in the Free World, she did not seek to join the Avant-garde but sought instead in her own words, to \\"make links between the basic elements of art and means of expression with her Polishness\\". Her inspiration coupled with the mature style of her creativity, enable her work to be characterised as art d√©co style. = Illustrations = Her public debut, aside from the Juvenilia, were illustrations and graphic designs for a first library edition of her husband's work, Agnieszka albo o Pannie na nied≈∫wiedziu, \\"Agnes or the Maiden atop the Bear\\", (Medyka 1925). It was a pastiche on a medieval Incunable, particularly on the Balthasar Behem Codex, well known to her and which inaugurated the publishing venture of the Medyka Library series which until it ceased in 1939, went on to produce 15 richly illustrated titles, generally the work of Pawlikowska. Among her significant contributions were two volumes by Beata Obesity≈Ñska, A Guitare and others - Gitara i tamci (Medyka 1926) and The tale of Brothers Frost. A Calendar dream - O Braciach Mro≈∫nych. Sen kalendarzowy (Medyka 1930). Notable were her gouache colour and black and white linocut illustrations for Zofia Kossak-Szczucka's God's Madman - Szale≈Ñcy Bo≈ºy (Krak√≥w 1929). In London Pawlikowska illustrated over a dozen titles for Veritas, a Polish religious publishing foundation. = Religious themes = Sacred topics were central to Pawlikowska's creativity, especially of Marian inspiration. Her portfolio of ten linocuts, Bogurodzica (Mother of God), overlain with watercolours and guilded are a reference to folk woodcarvings and paintings on glass. They were published by Medyka in 1930. Commenting on this art d√©co series, and other single works after the war, Pawlikowska said: \\"those pictures are on a religious theme, but my aim was to express them in Polish, not drawing on any pattern or style, rather perhaps relying on folk art (...) the point was to reflect the world through the Marian calendar and traditions, for example, Our Lady of Sowing, Our Lady of Berries, Our Lady of Herbs... and also to convey it by the simplest artistic means through line and thereby to confer as much expression as possible\\". A similar intention lies behind the style of the coloured linocut of \\"St. Hubertus\\" of 1936. The period after the war saw the creation of several important religious works by Pawlikowska. Among them are the 1947 depiction of \\"Saint Stanis≈Çaw Szczepanowski, bishop and martyr\\" for the altar of the Marian Fathers' chapel at Fawley Court in Buckinghamshire England, and two paintings whose fate is unknown, one from 1947 the other dated 1962. There are reproductions of \\"Prayer for the souls in purgatory\\" (1947) and \\"Father Maksymilian Kolbe\\" (1962). Throughout her career, she designed many Christmas and Easter cards. = Portraiture and landscapes = Pawlikowska devoted her entire life to the study of the human form and to nature. Her sketchbooks were filled with human figures, plants and animals as part of her uninterrupted daily atelier. She was an amateur botanist and an acute observer. Her landscapes, chiefly in watercolour, were initially a throwback to the 19th-century. Later they clearly referred to a growing fascination with Japanese painting and colour experimentation of the Interwar period. A separate chapter in her creative work were the studies of interiors - mainly of the palace in Medyka. After the war, knowing she could never return to her home, she immortalised those interiors from memory substituting artistic style for the eroded detail. Her portraiture that was to become the mainstay of √©migr√© family life and support for the chalet in Poland, oscillated initially between a style redolent of secessionism and new experiments with colour and form. However, the pressures of wartime and the difficult period in Italy of necessity turned much of her artwork into a commissioned commodity. It gained popularity in high society, but at the price of a reversion into traditional academic art. From her √©migr√© years, only a handful of works survive that were untainted by the loss of hope of ever returning to her homeland or by the increasing rigour of having to earn her living. Among them are three still lives and a painting of roses. They are outstanding works torn out of the daily drudgery and mark the artist's farewell to creative freedom. As though painted in haste in meaty oils is the painting \\"Roses\\", then in disharmonious colour comes the grotesque \\"Pinocchio and the doll\\" (circa 1943), \\"Black pudding on straw\\" (1960), and finally, \\"clay pots\\" (1970) were the last expressions of the artist's soul. Of her commissions in England, a certain \\"relic\\" remains in the form of a pastel drawing of the infant head of the future Diana, Princess of Wales.

The piece was made when Long walked a continuous line into a field of grass in Wiltshire, England, and then photographed the result. The work is considered to be an important early work in the history of both land art and conceptual art. It has been described as among Long's signature works, and as his \\"best- known early piece\\".Art in America, Volume 75 (1987), page 163. History A Line Made by Walking was made in 1967 when Long was a 22 year old art student at Saint Martin's School of Art, London. At the time, Long commuted regularly between his home in Bristol and the school, a journey of around 120 miles. Stopping in Wiltshire, he found a grassy area and walked a straight path in it repeatedly until a line was visible. He then took a black and white photograph of the result. The work was considered innovative at the time as it proposed that the simple act of walking could be an art form, and that art could be produced by the foot as well as the hand. The piece also questioned whether the performance ‚Äì or the document of the performance ‚Äì was the actual artwork. As such it presented a challenge to what was traditionally understood to be as sculpture. The work, which set the tone for Long's career as an artist, was one of his earliest pieces and his first walking-based piece. In the context of Long's career, A Line Made by Walking manifested the artist's fascination with trails and traces as mapped histories, a very prevalent theme in his work. A Line Made by Walking established Long as a minimalist and conceptual sculptor; it was also an early example of land art. Long created several pieces which hark back to the 1967 original including circles or organic paths, some in snow, dust, or even charred grass. These include Walking a Line in Peru (1972), a narrow path walked across a wide plain, leading to the foothills of distant mountains; A Line and Tracks in Bolivia (1981), approximately 150 feet long with accompanying tracks intersecting; Sea Level Waterline in Death Valley, California (1982), a path walked at the zero foot contour, representing sea level in low-lying Death Valley; and A Line in Nepal (1983), a forest path approximately 50 feet long. Collections The work is held in the collections of the Tate Museum, London, the Courtald Gallery, the Getty Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland. It has also been on display in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, as part of a major exhibition of Long's work held by that museum in the 1970s and 1980s. The 2017 novel, A Line Made by Walking, by Sara Baume, is named for the artwork.

Plot A family returning home from a swim are caught in slow-moving traffic among a sea of identical black hearselike self-driving cars along a multi-lane highway leading to a tunnel. At times the tunnel must be closed, forcing all vehicles to shut down and giving people time to stand outside. Peter befriends a girl named Eva from a car in the next lane. As they approach the tunnel it becomes apparent that the tunnel is used as a means of population reduction. While passing through it they are concerned that they will be caught in it during the next closure. A car from another lane decides to change lanes within the tunnel, delaying the family's progress. They make it out of the tunnel just before its next closure. Peter looks around but cannot find Eva's car.

They derived their concepts in response to the Catholic church music, which they found distracting and too ornate. Both principles also pursued use of the native tongue, either alongside or in place of liturgical Latin.  Background  \\"Luther hammers his 95 theses to the door\\" at the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany The Protestant Reformation, which rapidly spread throughout Europe in the sixteenth century, created sweeping changes in many facets of society. A call for reform and a subsequent break from the Roman Church by Martin Luther and his followers in 1521 following the Diet of Worms created an irreversible schism in the Church, and while this divide was more immediately noticeable politically, the Protestant movement changed many aspects of Europeans' daily lives through the reformed doctrine and practices of the new churches.. One of the most noticeable changes to take place was the way in which Christians worshiped through music. Before and during the Reformation, much of Catholic worship music consisted of highly florid choral works, Gregorian plainchant, and responsive songs in praise of God and in honor of the Virgin Mary. Protestant reformers, however, sought to change Catholicism's perceived \\"dangers of overly theatrical performances, the unwarranted expense of elaborate ceremonies and enormous pipe organs and the uselessness of text unintelligible to the common man.\\"John Barber. ‚ÄúLuther and Calvin on Music and Worship,‚Äù Reformed Perspectives 8 (June 25- July 1, 2006), 1. Accessed October 7, 2019. ProQuest Ebook Central. The urge for reform in these areas created two main schools of thought: One which adhered to the regulative principle of worship music, and one which followed the normative principle, with the latter becoming far more prevalent as time progressed. The dissension between these two groups led to stark contrasts in worship practices.  Emergence of Protestant church music  = Normative principle of worship, and Martin Luther = The normative principle provides an elastic interpretation to the Bible and God's intention about worship music, claiming: ‚ÄúWhat the Scripture forbids not, it allows; and what it allows is not unlawful; and what is not unlawful may lawfully be done.\\" This doctrine gave its followers great artistic and creative freedom in organizing worship services and composing hymns. Normative principlists often incorporated organ and other instruments into church music, and were not as stringent as regulative principlists on restricting the combination of various mediums of worship. Choir of Saint- Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church, Strasbourg The most notable follower of the normative principle was Martin Luther. Being a friar, Luther's life was steeped in the musical traditions of Roman chant and he had a deep love for music as a singer, lutenist, and composer. p. 60 Luther would make use of his musical skills to become a tool for promoting the teaching reforms of the Reformation. Luther strongly supported worship music and emphasized its importance in the church, and was one witnessed remarking: Luther's hymns date from 1523 to 1543. The earliest Lutheran hymnal was the Achtliederbuch or First Lutheran hymnal of 1524, with eight hymns by Luther and by Paul Speratus. Luther wrote 37 hymns which survive today, though he perhaps wrote additional texts which were passed around informally. Well known of Luther's hymns, and still in use, are \\"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\\" (Savior of the Nations, Come), Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her\\" (From Heaven Above to Earth I Come), \\"Christ lag in Todesbanden\\" (Christ Jesus Lay in Death's Strong Bands), \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" (Come, Holy Ghost, God and Lord), \\"Wir glauben all an einen Gott\\" (We All Believe in One True God), \\"Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin\\" (In Peace and Joy I Now Depart), \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (A Mighty Fortress Is Our God), \\"Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort\\" (Lord, Keep Us Steadfast in Thy Word), \\"Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir\\" (Out of the Depths I Cry to Thee), \\"Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist\\" (We now implore God the Holy Ghost) and \\"Vater unser im Himmelreich\\" (Our Father, Thou in Heaven Above). These and many of the other hymns by Luther would constitute the base of many chorale-based compositions by Sch√ºtz, Bach, Brahms, and others. Luther built on traditional hymns in words and melodies, Latin chants, German songs, secular and sacred folk songs, and hymns from the Bohemian community. Claims that some of Luther's hymns were based on bar tunes or drinking songs perhaps expounded from the use of popular tunes in his hymns, and from later musical terminology that referred to many of these hymns as being in bar form. However, there is no evidence that actual drinking songs were used as hymn tunes. In addition to hymns, Luther also composed German liturgical chants used in the Deutsche Messe (German mass) of 1526, as well as chant settings for various canticles, litanies, and a motet. Luther's most notable musical legacy is his development of hymnody in the vernacular German language. His intent was to include the laity in the liturgy, Wilson-Dickson, pg. 60-61 although the development of congregational singing among Lutherans was to be an uneven, and gradual process over the next three centuries. Involving the laity with singing hymns was a teaching tool. Some hymns were modeled after sections of Luther's Small Catechism, such as \\"Vater unser im Himmelreich\\" which was based on the Lord's Prayer. Introduction to Luther's Small Catechism The hymns could by sung unaccompanied, but organs and choir supported congregational singing where such resources were available. Wilson- Dickson, pg. 62 Organ music would play a large role in Lutheran music later on. Luther said that music ought to be ‚Äúaccorded the greatest honour and a place next to theology‚Äù due to its great importance. During the Reformation, Luther did much to encourage the composition and publication of hymns, and wrote numerous worship songs in German. In keeping with the normative principle, Luther popularized the use of songs inspired by Scripture, as opposed to Calvinist metered or even word-for-word recitations of the Psalms and other biblical texts. For example, Luther's widely popular hymn \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" while based on Psalm 46, contains language not directly taken from Scripture. This combination of Biblical language with composers' additions and basic ornamentation in Lutheran hymns allowed Luther and his followers to include emotional musical phrasing which appealed to a broader audience. However, Luther's approval of textual elaboration and musical complexities in chorales did not mean that he completely disregarded Protestant orthodoxies. While Luther supported the use of polyphony, he still made it clear that he regarded the main purpose of hymns as teaching the populace about Scripture and worshiping God. One reason for Luther's adoption of the normative principle and his application of it with his own church music was to more effectively disseminate his ideas, particularly to other German speaking areas. Luther's hymns were primarily written in the vernacular and consisted of universal themes such as hope, peace, and grace, which transcended socioeconomic boundaries. Luther also increased the popularity of his songs by setting religious text and his own improvised lyrics to secular folk tunes known well throughout German provinces. Luther even penned hymns which touched on political issues and promoted the Reformation. In his zeitungslied (newspaper song), \\"Ein neues Lied wir heben an\\" (A new song here shall be begun), Luther condemned the burning of Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos, two young Augustinian canons active in the Reformation. He commended their faith and witness to the gospel while and censuring their condemnation. These qualities made Luther's works well received across Germany, and many were soon translated into other languages. \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (A Mighty Fortress is Our God) in particular has since been translated into 53 languages. = Regulative principle of worship, and John Calvin = Many Protestant reformers, drawing from the Bible and the concept of Sola scriptura, Latin for by scripture alone, argued that worship music ought to be derived directly from the book of Psalms in the Old Testament. This concept came to be known as the regulative principle. Its adherents asserted that ‚Äúworship is by divine warrant#Nounwarrant \\", and that God intended mankind to worship Him through Scripture only, since the Bible serves as God‚Äôs revelation to man on how He is to be worshiped. For instance, in the Heidelberg Catechism, the author, German Reformed theologian Zacharias Ursinus states, ‚ÄúQ. What does God require in the second commandment? / A. We are not to make an image of God in any way, nor to worship Him in any other manner than he has commanded in His Word.‚Äù Followers of the regulative principle vehemently opposed worship music containing text not from Scripture verbatim, and thus their worship services contained only hymns arranged from the Psalms (hence the term \\"psalmody\\"). Regulative principlists were often firm and intransigent in their beliefs, as is seen in the Belgic Confession, where the author decrees, \\"The whole manner of worship which God requires of us is written in it [the Bible] at length. It is therefore unlawful for any one [sic], even for an apostle, to teach otherwise than we are now taught in Holy Scripture: yes, even if it be an angel from heaven, as the apostle Paul says.\\"Guido De Bres. The Belgic Confession. 1561. John Calvin There were many prominent theologians and church leaders during the Reformation who adhered to the regulative principle. On one extreme, Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531), a Swiss priest, rejected all forms of music within worship. He ‚Äúremoved all art works from the church... [and] destroyed organs and other musical instruments‚Ä¶ because according to him, they promoted self-indulgence.‚ÄùRobert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 84. However, most regulative principle advocates still promoted the use of worship music in the church, only in the sense that only Scripture could be used in songs. John Calvin (1509-1564) was a regulative principle supporter who encouraged worship music. A Frenchman, Calvin studied civil law in Paris and Orl√©ans, but was soon pressured to leave France due to heavy opposition to his Protestant sympathies. He eventually relocated to Geneva, where he further synthesized his doctrine and continued to aid the reform movement, especially through his theological dissertations.Robert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 85. Calvin‚Äôs attitude towards music in the Church was complex. Like all who followed the regulative principle, he was extremely cautious about how worship music was utilized, because he believed God laid out very specific directions in the Bible on how one could worship. For example, Calvin initially allowed the use of instruments in worship music, but ‚Äúadvocate[ed] a careful and skillful use‚Äù of them.Robert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 87. In fact, he later banned instruments from being used in his congregation, claiming that they were too strongly tied to antiquated and unorthodox methods from before the Reformation.Robert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 89. Calvin also asserted that ‚ÄúThere could be no worship of God without the proper preaching of the Word.‚ÄùRobert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 88. In selecting hymns for church services, Calvin avoided anything that may have invited ‚Äúsensuality and self- gratification.‚ÄùRobert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 91. To this effect, many of the songs which received his approval were simple in nature and lacked the melodic and harmonic complexities of many Catholic masses. They were ‚Äúsung syllabically,‚Äù and the melodies moved primarily by conjunct motion, avoiding large and uncomfortable intervals.Neil Stipp. ‚ÄúMusic Philosophies of Martin Luther and John Calvin,‚Äù American Organist (September 2007), 5. One element which Calvin added to worship music was children‚Äôs choirs. Calvin was deeply concerned for the piety and religious devotion of parishioners, and posited that children could \\"teach adults simplicity, childlike devotion, and a sincere heart when singing, even though there might be problems with intonation and the like.\\"Robert Osei-Bonsu. \\"John Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church\\", Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 87. While many Protestants, including followers of Martin Luther, objected to Calvin‚Äôs rather staunch approach to music, Calvin did much to develop a new form of music separate from hundreds of years of Catholic doctrine and ritual. His use of the vernacular in the recitation of the Psalms made worship music more accessible and comprehensible to the public, and his simple melodies and inclusion of children‚Äôs choirs encouraged congregational participation in worship services.Robert Osei-Bonsu. ‚ÄúJohn Calvin‚Äôs Perspective on Worship and Music, and its Implications for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,‚Äù Ilorian Journal of Religious Studies, 3, 1, (2013), 87.  Anabaptist church music   Anglican church music  King Henry VIII of England (1491 ‚Äì1547) During the same time period of that Luther and Calvin were active on the mainland, England too was influenced and experienced its own distinct reformation movement. King Henry VIII, after failing to convince Pope Clement VII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon so that he could marry Anne Boleyn, proclaimed himself head of the Church of England, an action which was officialised in Parliament‚Äôs 1534 Act of Supremacy.The Act of Supremacy. C. 65/143, m. 5, nos. 8 and 9. Accessed October 7, 2019. National Archives.gov.uk. After this, England‚Äôs political ties to Rome were severed, but although the Church of England adopted a primarily Calvinist theology, it still retained many of the ecclesiastical traditions of Catholic services, to the dismay of the more conservative Calvinists. Given England‚Äôs unique situation, English Protestant music emerged as its own distinct genre during and after the Reformation. In some ways, it reflected elements of Calvinism; for instance, Calvinist psalmodies were exceedingly popular in mid-sixteenth century England. However, English congregations also utilized materials which would be considered more Lutheran in style, including broadside ballads which were repurposed for religious use. A particularly common source of worship material in English churches was the Second Book of Common Prayer, commissioned by the Protestant King Edward VI in 1552. The English Reformation oversaw the proliferation of English Protestant composers and the writing of many English psalters (musical arrangements of the Book of Psalms). This was in part due to a reaction against Catholic worship music following the English Reformation. English Protestants particularly denounced Catholic music due to the fact ‚Äúthat it was performed in a foreign tongue [Latin],‚Äù which they saw as conflicting with parts of Scripture and therefore with the will of God. Because of this, English clergymen and composers began to form a unique canon of English worship music distinct from that of continental Europe. Perhaps the most notable early Anglican Protestant composer was Issac Watts, known as the ‚ÄúFather of English Hymnody\\". Watts broke with the popular Calvinist theology of the time by altering his arrangements of the Psalms to better reflect Christian elements found only in the New Testament, as is evident by the title of his work, The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament. Another prominent English composer of the time was Benjamin Keach (1640-1704), a minister and leader of the Particular Baptist denomination. Keach is responsible for being the first songwriter to popularize the singing of hymns as opposed to purely Psalms in English churches, and his song collection, titled A Feast of Fat Things, became a staple in many English Protestant churches.Benjamin Keach. ‚ÄúA feast of fat things full of marrow containing several Scripture songs taken out of the Old and New Testaments, with others composed by t[he author] : Together [with o]ne hundred of divine hymns, being the first century.‚Äù (B.H., London, 1696). Accessed October 7, 2019. Quod.lib.umich.edu. While many English composers experimented with polyphonic chorales and the use of multiple instruments, the English Crown, under the young Protestant King Edward VI, began to tightly restrict these elements during a brief revival of English-Calvinist regulative theology. However, many of these restrictions on church music were lifted with Edward VI‚Äôs premature death and the Catholic Mary Tudor‚Äôs ascension to the throne in 1553.

History Marsh had a long-standing musical partnership with his then brother-in-law, Ken Nicol, during the 1970s. They first signed to CBS in 1973, and were known as the duo Nicol & Marsh. In 1975, after the addition of Richard James Burgess, they became known as Easy Street, named after the duo's 1974 album Nicol & Marsh's Easy Street. As the trio Easy Street, they released two albums, the eponymous Easy Street in 1976 and Under the Glass in 1977. The single \\"I've Been Lovin' You\\" reached No. 81 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 during the first week of August 1976. Easy Street toured in Europe and the US and were the 1976 runners-up of the UK TV show New Faces. The collaboration between Marsh and Nicol ended after the release of the duo's final album, 1978's Nicol & Marsh. An interview with Nicol implied that Marsh was moving in a different direction, specifically appearing to refer to a growing collaboration between Marsh and Burgess. After Easy Street Ken Nicol settled in the U.S. in 1979 and performed as a solo artist, and later as lead singer and co-writer for the band Versailles. He returned to England in 1988 and continued as a solo performer. He later joined the bands the Ashley Hutchings Dance Band, the Albion Band and Steeleye Span. Nicol has released a number of solo albums since 1988, with his latest album, Things in 2015. Peter Marsh has worked as a singer, songwriter and record producer. He was a member of the new wave bands Twist and Blanket of Secrecy, and has worked with such artists as Vangelis, Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Godley & Creme, Nick Lowe and Carlene Carter. Marsh released the solo albums Stop the Clock (2013) and Back to the Beginning (2017). Richard James Burgess has been a singer, songwriter, drummer, engineer and producer since the mid-1970s, most notably as a member of the band Landscape. He produced new wave band Spandau Ballet's first two albums and first seven singles. He has worked with many other artists during his 45-year music career.

The novel centers around Ursa Corregidora, who was recently hospitalized after an accident involving a flight of stairs. The first three sections of the novel follow Ursa through her recovery, her changing relationships, and her profession as a blues singer. The final two sections of Corregidora flash forward to 1969 when Mutt returns. Jones uses a fragmented style of writing to incorporate the Corregidora family history of trauma into Ursa's present narrative. Overall, Corregidora considers difficult themes of generational trauma, preservation of memory, domestic and sexual violence, and womanhood and motherhood. Literary critics have highly regarded Jones' writing in this novel.  Summary  = Section I = The novel opens with Ursa Corregidora recounting her marriage with Mutt Thomas and the \\"accident\\" on the staircase behind Happy's Caf√©. Ursa wakes up in the hospital, and soon after, Tadpole McCormick brings her to his home above Happy's. Tadpole takes care of Ursa while she is recovering, and the reader learns that Ursa had a hysterectomy as the result of falling down the stairs. Through Ursa's memories, the reader discovers that Ursa's Great Gram was a slave who was raped by her master and other men who would pay for her. When U.C. is five- years-old, Great Gram describes how she was also forced to sleep with the master's wife, and Ursa is slapped for questioning the story. While recovering, Ursa is paid a visit by her neighbor, Cat Lawson, who tells Ursa that Mutt has been hanging outside of Happy's, hoping to see her. Ursa then admits to Cat that she was pregnant when the accident happened, and she lost the baby. Ursa visits the doctor and states that she is filing for divorce from Mutt. After her appointment, Ursa goes to stay with Cat for the remainder of her recovery, but this does not last long. Jeffy touches Ursa's breasts while she is sleeping, and later, Ursa hears Cat threatening Jeffy in her bedroom early in the morning. Ursa returns to stay with Tadpole, and the couple begin a sexual relationship. That night, Ursa begins singing at Happy's again, and after her show, Jimmy asks Ursa if she would speak to Mutt, telling her she is pitying herself. Upstairs, Tadpole learns that Mutt signed the divorce papers and asks Ursa to marry him. Ursa and Tadpole get married with Cat as their witness, and Cat speaks to Ursa alone after the wedding. U.C. barely acknowledges Cat and refuses to ignore what she heard that night in Cat's bedroom. The section ends with Ursa singing to Tadpole, and the newlywed couple making love. = Section II = The section opens with Ursa speaking to Sal and calling on memories about how she is often mistaken to be Spanish. In the apartment, Tadpole tells Ursa that Cat is planning on moving to Versailles. Ursa's sex with Tadpole is uncomfortable for her and more for his pleasure. When Ursa wakes up from a night of irregular sleep, Tadpole describes how his Papa was a slave that became a blacksmith, but his Mama was denied the land he had bought when she went to claim it. Then, Ursa remembers how her Great Gram remained with Corregidora after slavery was abolished, but in 1906, Great Gram and Gram moved to Louisiana and began working. Tadpole urges Ursa to be more relaxed during sex, but Ursa is still uneasy. Ursa is reminded of her arguments with Mutt over the men who watched her sing at Happy's. Ursa gets an offer to sing Saturdays at the Spider and takes the job. One night, Tadpole doesn't come to pick up Ursa, and she finds him in bed with Vivian, a young new singer. Tadpole says that Vive can do more him than Ursa can, and Ursa leaves to check into the Drake hotel. A few days later, Tadpole shows up to apologize, but Ursa does not feel sympathetic to his pleading. Ursa begins singing full-time at the Spider, and Max praises her singing and how she has helped his business. Max makes a sexual advance on Ursa, but Ursa denies him and makes him promise not to come onto her ever again if she is to continue working. The text begins to flash forward to conversations between Mutt and Ursa about rekindling their romance and the blues. Ursa describes to Mutt how her life is tied into the lives of her ancestors and how the memories of their trauma still affect her. Ursa returns to her small hometown, Bracktown, to see her Mama who is making preserves for her neighbor. Ursa seeks for more history than Corregidora, asking her mother about who her father was. Ursa learns that her father, Martin, worked at a restaurant across the street from the depot, where Mama used to have lunch. Mama was very shy and would not respond to Martin when he asked her about herself. One day, Mama had dinner at the restaurant too, and Martin offered to ride the bus with her. They stopped by his house to get his jacket, and Mama went upstairs with him. After Ursa was conceived, Mama was surprised by her own actions and stopped speaking to Martin. When Martin sent Mama money awhile later, Mama returned the money to him. At his house in Cincinnati, Martin beat Mama, claiming that she used him to get pregnant. In the present, Ursa and Mama begin walking back to the bus station. Mama then describes the brief time that she was married to Martin before he left. Great Gram had begged him to marry Mama, and they lived in the house of the Corregidora women together. While Mama did not talk to Martin about Corregidora much, he could hear Great Gram and Gram remembering their trauma. Mama was not having sex with Martin, and after a fishing trip, Gram caught Martin watching her powder her breasts. Gram and Martin cursed at one another, and Martin started walking outside the house to get to the front room. After their conversation, Ursa gets on the bus and heads back into the city. = Section III = The third section opens with Ursa remembering the suicide of the Melrose woman and her childhood friend, May Alice. May Alice was older than Ursa and taught Ursa what penises and periods were. In high school, May Alice started having sex with a boy from school, Harold, and became pregnant. After Mama told Ursa not to hang around May Alice anymore, Ursa did not see her until she had her baby and once more before she moved. Mary Alice asked Ursa why she didn't like her any longer and called Ursa a child for not telling her. Then, Ursa remembers how Mama did not like her singing the blues, which led her to move to the city and apply at Happy's. Ursa remembers meeting Mutt at Happy's, sitting with him after her performance and talking about the blues. After this, Ursa and Mutt began talking in Ursa's dressing room, where Ursa learned that Mutt's great-grandfather bought his and his wife's freedom. When his great-grandfather got into debt, they took his wife, and he went crazy. That night, Mutt made a sexual advance, but Ursa turned him down, remembering the Corregidora women. They did not have sex until their wedding night. After four months, Mutt began watching the other men at Happy's and pressuring Ursa to stop performing. Ursa remembers the building tension between them over Mutt's jealousy and mood swings. One Friday night, Mutt and Ursa go to Dixieland to see a band from Chicago. Mutt embarrasses Ursa by grabbing her butt and trying to grind, so Ursa does not take his hand to dance again and goes to the bathroom instead of singing. The married couple went home, and Mutt defends his actions and threatens her for not taking his hand. The next night Mutt shows up to Happy's drunk and is thrown out after trying to take Ursa off of the stage. When Ursa leaves Happy's after the evening show, Mutt drunkenly returns to confront Ursa and knocks her down the stairs. = Section IV = This section flashes forward to June of 1969 when Ursa is forty-seven and still working at the Spider. Ursa speaks to a man who is performing at the Drake hotel about the blues and remembers how Corregidora raped her Great Gram. Ursa had not seen Sal since she left Happy's and had only run into to Tadpole a few times since leaving him. She heard that Tadpole had gotten together with Vivian and sold Happy's. Ursa saw Jeffrene downtown who told her that she had pneumonia recently. Jeffrene also mentioned that Cat was living in Versailles and had a hair accident, and she asked Ursa if she would go see her. = Section V = Jim still came into the Spider at least once a week, and once got drunk and harassed Ursa. Sal came in to talk to Ursa after her show, telling her that she had seen Mutt. Ursa admits that she had been thinking about Mutt but does not know how she feels about him. Soon after, Mutt came into the Spider while Ursa was singing; she sang to him but knew she hadn't forgiven him. Mutt asked Ursa if she would come back with him, and she said yes. Back at the Drake hotel, Mutt and Ursa have oral sex, and Ursa thinks about what Great Gram did to Corregidora to make him both hate and desire her. The novel ends with Mutt holding Ursa, and Ursa crying against him.  Characters * Ursa Corregidora is a twenty-five year-old black female blues singer and the protagonist of the novel. She is the daughter of a line of Corregidora slave women who were raped by their master. Ursa describes carrying this family history with her everywhere she goes. At the start of the novel, an incident causes her to lose a baby and have a hysterectomy. Ursa also struggles with this trauma throughout the novel. *Mutt Thomas sees Ursa performing at Happy‚Äôs one day, and Ursa begins singing to him. The two develop a relationship and are married in 1947. Soon after, Mutt becomes increasingly jealous of the men who watch Ursa perform. Mutt begins aggressively grabbing Ursa in public and threatening to take her off the stage. The young couple also develops sexual tension and manipulative tendencies in their relationship. Ursa becomes more vocal and stands up for herself against Mutt‚Äôs ravings. In April 1948, Mutt drunkenly confronts Ursa on her way home from Happy‚Äôs, and she ‚Äúfalls‚Äù down a staircase in an alleyway. Ursa blames Mutt for the incident and the two are divorced. At the conclusion of the novel, in 1969, the two rekindle their relationship. * Tadpole McCormick is the owner of Happy‚Äôs Caf√©. Ursa describes Tadpole as a ‚Äúsquare-jawed and high-cheekboned‚Äù Kentucky man. When Mutt tries to take Ursa home during a performance, Tadpole has him thrown out of the club and ensures that he does not return. Tadpole visits Ursa in the hospital and brings Ursa to his home above Happy‚Äôs to stay with him. Other than her brief time at Cat‚Äôs house, Tadpole cares for Ursa throughout her recovery. The two are married and Ursa begins singing at Happy‚Äôs once again. Ursa leaves Tadpole after discovering he has cheated on her with Vivian, a new young performer at Happy‚Äôs. *Catherine (Cat) Lawson initially lives across the street from Happy‚Äôs Caf√©, the club where Ursa works for most of the novel. Cat sometimes does hair from her home, and she takes Ursa in for a few days after her time in the hospital. However, Ursa leaves when she is groped by Jeffy and realizes that Cat is a lesbian. After leaving Cat‚Äôs house, Ursa refuses to talk to Cat, and Cat eventually moves to Versailles. * Jeffrene (Jeffy) is the young girl who Cat mentors and feeds. When Jeffy and Ursa share a bed for the night at Cat‚Äôs house, Jeffy irks Ursa by bringing up Mutt, then grabs Ursa‚Äôs breasts in the middle of the night. After Cat moves, Ursa sometimes sees Jeffy around town and crosses the street to avoid her. When Ursa is forty-seven, she learns about Cat‚Äôs hair accident from Jeffrene who also asks Ursa to see Catherine. *Sal Cooper works during the day at Happy's Caf√© and is friendly with Ursa after she marries Tadpole. The two women weren't at Happy's during the same shifts, so they did not talk very often. * Jimmy is Mutt‚Äôs cousin who comes into Happy‚Äôs while Ursa is singing and later, Spider. Jimmy questions Ursa about her relationship with Tadpole and asks Ursa to talk to Mutt. * Max is the owner of Spider who hires Ursa to sing. Max tries to begin a relationship with Ursa, but Ursa quickly shuts down his advances. The two maintain a professional relationship, and Max often reiterates how Ursa is an asset to his establishment.  Themes  = Generational trauma = Ursa Corregidora's narrative is intertwined with the histories of the slave owner, Corregidora, and her female ancestors. Ursa's Great Gram was a slave of Corregidora who he raped, and she became pregnant with Gram. Gram was then raped by Corregidora and became pregnant with Ursa's mother. Ursa's family moved to Louisiana after the abolition of slavery in Portugal. At as early as five-years of age, Ursa describes her grandmother telling her these histories and insisting she remember them. Ursa carries the history of these traumas with her everywhere, and they impact how she develops her relationships. Both Mutt and Tadpole question the significance of the stories of Corregidora and how they affect Ursa's romances. The generational trauma passed down by her maternal ancestry is a prominent topic throughout the novel. The connection between trauma and memory is often discussed in scholarly articles about Corregidora. In particular, academics have considered how Ursa's familial trauma under slavery affects her romantic relationships in the present. In her critical essay, Stella Setka discusses the impacts of this \\"traumatic rememory\\" inherited from her ancestry. Setka considers how this collective trauma influences Ursa's sexuality and agency. = Preservation of memory = Ursa describes a pressure from her mother and grandmother to \\"make generations.\\" After one night with Martin, a man who worked at the caf√© across the street, Ursa's mother becomes pregnant with her. She describes that her whole body wanted Ursa. Ursa feels this urge to \\"make generations\\" but is unable to do so after her hysterectomy. Ursa's grandmother emphasizes how important it is to continue sharing their histories of sexual violence and slavery. The women use their lineage and oral history as a documentation of the truth to be used as evidence. By preserving these memories through their children, the Corregidora women plan to ensure that their stories are never forgotten. Literary scholars have emphasized how the Corregidora actively preserve memory through their oral histories. According to this discussion, the ongoing recounting of Corregidora history becomes enmeshed with the present narrative in the novel. Abdennebi Ben Beya is one of the scholars analyzing this tension between past and present. Beya considers history to be a haunting presence in Corregidora, emphasizing the simultaneous mourning and healing in re-experiencing this trauma. = Sexual and domestic violence = The initial conflict presented in the novel is how Ursa's fall causes her to lose a fetus and her uterus. While Ursa's neighbors and friends claim that it was an accident, Ursa states that Mutt knocked her down the stairs, indicating that it was an instance of domestic violence. Ursa's mother is also hit repeatedly by Ursa's father when visiting him to return an envelope he sent with money. Since Ursa's grandmothers were raped by their slaveowners, Jones writes a violent history for all of the Corregidora women. Ursa's hysterectomy and the history of violence in her family affect how she navigates her sexuality throughout the novel. In critical essays that discuss Corregidora, the theme of sexual and domestic violence is connected to the themes of trauma and history. Because the violence in Ursa's intimate relationships is reflected in the rape and trauma the Corregidora women underwent in slavery, scholars draw connections between painful collective memories and the violence in the present narrative. Specifically, Joanne Lipson Freed points out the duplication of sexual exploitation in each of the lives of each Corregidora woman. Freed ties the repetition of trauma into the collective memory of the African American community. = Womanhood and motherhood = The Corregidora women Ursa recounts in the novel form a matrilineal ancestry. Particularly, Ursa describes the histories of her Great Gram, Gram, and Mama. Ursa describes how the Corregidora women were compelled to \\"make generations,\\" connecting motherhood to remembering their trauma. Ursa describes a responsibility in her family to become women by bearing children. When Ursa has a hysterectomy, she also concerns herself with how being unable to have children will affect her womanhood. Ursa's loss of a child also connects motherhood and womanhood to the violence in Corregidora. Academic articles that evaluate Jones' Corregidora recurrently analyze the themes of womanhood and motherhood. Scholars consider how these two topics are connected in the experiences of the Corregidora women. Ifeona Fulani analyzes how the mother-daughter relationships in the novel frame the black female subject. Fulani takes a psychological approach to understanding this correlation, noting the influence of gender and conflict on the community.  Critical response  Gayl Jones' use of language in Corregidora has been highly regarded since its publication in 1975. Particularly, critics have placed Gayl Jones among a canon of Black women writers for her manipulation of structure and speech as literary devices. Critics have also praised Jones' emphasis on the oral history of African American language. Other than the overall favorable critical response Jones has received for Corregidora, the novel has been critiqued for lacking detailed physical descriptions of its characters. In an interview by Claudia Tate, Gayl Jones describes her intention to draw on the African American tradition of oral storytelling. Tate's subsequent remark that Corregidora felt like a private story in her reading forms the critique that the novel is unable to reproduce an oral history. Writers including James Baldwin and Maya Angelou have commented on Corregidora as honest and painful as well as a murky American tale (respectfully).

Launched in 1855, it ran until 1861 and later was merged with Rast Goftar, another newspaper published in Bombay. History Karsandas Mulji, a social reformer and journalist, previously wrote for the Rast Goftar and Stribodh magazines, but readership of these magazines were mostly limited to Parsis. He therefore established Satyaprakash in 1855 with the help of Mangalbhai Naththubhai. He edited it while Rustomji Ranina was the publisher. His articles addressed forward Hindu caste leaders and attacked social and religious customs and practises. Mulji addressed various social issues such as female education, excessive spending in pompous marriages, indecent songs sung during marriages, and the funeral ritual of chest beating. The caste leaders were unhappy about these articles and tried to excommunicate Mulji from his Kapol Vaniya caste, but could not garner support within the community. Satyaprakash merged with the Rast Goftar in 1861, and the merged continued publishing under the latter name until 1921.  Notable articles  Among the notable articles which Mulji wrote for the weekly was one titled Gulamikhat (), in which he criticised the sign campaign and the process of law-making by Vaishnavas so that Maharaj (religious heads) should not have to visit the court due to religious status. After publication of the article, there were some attempts to appease Mulji with large amounts of money, but these failed. Following this incident, Mulji wrote a few articles‚Äînamely Maharajo ne vinanti () and Dharmguruo ni satta ()‚Äîin which he openly expressed his anger. An article by Mulji published on 21 September 1890, titled (), criticised Vaishnava Archaryas (Hindu religious leaders) for their behaviour, which resulted in the Maharaj Libel Case in 1862. Reception Vaishnava religious heads started publishing a pamphlet called Swadharmvardhak ane Sanshaychedak (). In the pamphlet, they labelled Mulji and other social reformers greedy, atheists, and idiots. In its response, Satyaprakash accused religious heads of being frauds and called their religious books poisonous. Jadunath Maharaj, Vaishnava religious head, wrote a fiery article in Chabuk and in the response, Mulji wrote . Mulji's articles led to the Maharaj Libel Case, which Mulji won.

Overview As per the District Human Development Report for the South 24 Parganas, the Sundarbans area, in the southern part of the erstwhile 24 Parganas district, includes 102 deltaic islands, out of which 54 are inhabited and the rest is reserved forest. The area spread over 25,500 km2 having around 3.9 million people or about 40% of the total population of the area. According to the December 2001 census there were 271 Royal Bengal Tigers and other animals in the Indian portion of the Sundarban forest, spread across 9.630 km2. The floor of the Sundarbans varies from 0.9 m to 2.11 m above sea level. Tidal saline water from the Bay of Bengal alternatively drowns and exposes the islands twice a day throughout the year. Around 3,500 km of earthen embankments, protecting the inhabited islands, have been facing the daily onslaught in a cyclone-prone area for more than a century. Amitav Ghosh writes that, Sir Daniel Mackinnon Hamilton, a Scotsman, had travelled to Kolkata to work for the MacKinnon & McKenzie, a company with which he had family connections. The company sold tickets for the P&O; shipping line, then one of the largest in the world. Hamilton became head of the company and master of an immense fortune, one of the richest men in British India. Another man may have taken his money and gone away but Hamilton set his eyes on the deltaic islands in south Bengal. In 1903, he bought of the tide country from the government ‚Äì it included such islands as Gosaba, Rangabelia, and Satjelia. His efforts at developing these places brought in other people into these islands. They were people who dared not only to struggle against nature but also the predators that lived there ‚Äì tigers, crocodiles, sharks and lizards. They killed so many people that Hamilton gave rewards to people who killed them.Ghosh, Amitav, The Hungry Tide, 2004, pp. 49-53, Harper Collins/Indiaoday group, . In December 1932, Rabindranath Tagore visited and stayed at Gosaba in the house of Sir Daniel Hamilton.

History Our knowledge of the past of the Sundarbans area is patchy. However, various tracts of what is now the South 24 Parganas have recognisable historical antecedents. Scholars accept that the more accessible and less hostile areas of the Indian portion of the Sundarbans had human habitation till the 15-16th century. From that time, geological and tectonic movements resulted in the main course of the Ganges shifting eastward and the Padma becoming the main distributary of the Ganges. Consequently, there was a marked decline in the supply of fresh water to what is now the Indian Sundarbans. Long before the British came, there were people like Mubarra Ghazi, a fakir, who converted the forested western (left) bank of the Hooghly into paddy lands. The forests were the Sundarbans fresh water swamp forests, now virtually extinct. In the early 16th century, the Portuguese arrived on the scene. The estuarine southern parts of Bengal remained under effective control of the Portuguese pirates and free-booters. The Arakanese pirates were also there. The area got depopulated and the forests extended. With the treaty of 1757 between Mir Jafar and the East India Company, the British acquired the zamindari rights of the 24 Parganas. The area around Kolkata was uncultivated waste land and the western limit of the Sundarbans was just about 7 miles away. The British were keen to bring the Sundarbans under cultivation and convert them into revenue paying assets. The forest was not given a thought. Reclamation of the Sundarbans meant surveying and mapping the area. It started in 1810. Lieutenant W.E.Morrieson and his brother Captain Hugh Morrieson, worked for about a decade, and produced the base materials on which later maps of the area were developed. Subsequently, Ensign Prinsep worked on mapping the area. Since places did not have names, he termed the geographical areas as ‚Äúlots‚Äù. In the 1830s, William Dampire and Lieutenant Hodges mapped the entire area, renumbering the lots from 1-236. ‚ÄúPrinseps Line‚Äù and ‚ÄúDampire-Hodges Line‚Äù mark the furthest limits of the Sundarbans. Ideas about conservation of forests started seeping in from the 1830s but the Sundarbans have shrunk dramatically. From a reasonable estimate of the forested area, at the beginning of the 19th century, at 6,550 sq miles or almost 17,000 sq km down to 10,217 sq km (5.955 sq km in Bangladesh and 4,262 sq km in India). Forest clearing Clearing of the forests effectively started in 1781. The \\"present settlements originate from the plan conceived by Clod Russell, then Collector General in 1771, whereby the forest land had been divided into plots to be leased out to prospective landlords. Clearing of the forest effectively started from 1781 by Tillman Henkel, then magistrate of Jessore district\\". In about a century the Hingalganj, Hasnabad, Sandeshkhali I, Sandeshkhali II, Minakhan and Haroa CD blocks (all in the North 24 Parganas district in 2016), the Canning I, Canning II, Jaynagar II, Mathurapur I, Mathurapur II and Sagar CD blocks (all in the South 24 Parganas district in 2016) had been fully or substantially cleared of forests. Thereafter, much of the interiors of the Kakdwip, Namkhana, Patharpratima, Basanti, Kultali and Gosaba CD blocks were cleared for human settlement. People started moving into the area. The refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan were the last to come in large numbers between 1951 and 1971. The Canning I, Canning II, Jaynagar II, Mathurapur I, Mathurapur II, Kakdwip and Namkhana CD blocks are a little away from the forests and are being attached/ connected to the mainland. Their conditions are similar to the other mainland CD blocks in the district, but the Basanti, Gosaba, Kultali, Patharpratima and Sagar CD blocks are largely isolated from the mainland. These islands are mostly separated from the deep forest by a river. Electric connections are rare, and transport and communications, other than river transport, are not there. Around 95% people depend on rain-fed agriculture. The Sagar CD block lies at the mouth of the Hooghly River, which carries fresh water and so things are a little different there. The sea level, around India, is estimated to be rising at 2.55 mm per year. In the last 70 years, 220 km2 of forest land has been submerged and the process continues. Poverty As per the Human Development Report for the South 24 Parganas district, published in 2009, the poverty rates were very high in the Sundarban region with all the thirteen CD blocks registering poverty ratios above 30% and eight CD blocks had more than 40% of the population in the BPL category. The Sundarban region remains the most backward region in terms of quality of life. As per rural household survey in 2005, the proportion of households in the South 24 Parganas with poverty rates below poverty line was 34.11%, way above the state and national poverty ratios.As per the Human Development Report for North 24 Parganas district, the economic scenario is equally gloomy, except for Hasnabad and Sandeshkhali II CD blocks, both of which had population below poverty line at slightly below 30%. Two blocks had between 30 and 40%, one between 40 and 50% and the highest at 59.7%. Physiographically the Sundarbans consist of the marine delta zone. As the sea receded southwards, in the sub-recent geological period, a large low- lying plain got exposed. Both tidal inflows and the rivers have been depositing sediments in this plain. In the Sundarbans overwhelming majority of the population is dependent on agriculture. The saline soil of the area is unfit for cultivation. Moreover, the irrigation facilities have not been extended to a satisfactory scale. Agriculture mostly remains a mono-cropped activity. Dominique Lapierre's floating hospitals Four launches with doctors carrying medicines, sophisticated portable X-ray and echo-cardiograph machines, provided by the French author Dominique Lapierre move along the waterways of the Sundarbans to its furthest corners. Residents of such places as Sandeshkhali, Basanti, Gosaba and Kultali have expressed their gratitude to him for his support when he came in 2004. Since 1981, Lapierre has dedicated half of his royalty earnings from his books to sustain a humanitarian movement in the slums of Kolkata and the deprived areas of rural Bengal. For his work, Lapierre was made a citizen of honour of Kolkata.He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the 2008 Republic Day honours list. As of 2007, over the years Lapierre's foundation has an enviable record in the Sunderbans: 100,000 people with tuberculosis have been treated, floating operation rooms have carried out 3,000 operations, 9,000 children have been treated for leprosy and they perform 30 cataract operations per day. A major portion of his book royalties amounting to about $3 million annually was spent in the Sundarbans, As of 2010, Lapiere‚Äôs foundation was operating 14 projects in India mostly in the Sundarbans. His floating dispensaries covered 54 islands. He is seeking support for projects for the poor, but the response is not there. He says, ‚ÄúI want Indians to be concerned about the poor.

The station was the ABC television affiliate in Salina throughout its existence, but operating on a UHF channel and with extremely low-power facilities for a full-service TV station, it could not compete effectively with the VHF television stations received in Salina. The station closed in 1965 and began a quest to move a VHF allocation to Salina, which ended in failure when the Federal Communications Commission ruled the proposal technically deficient in 1968. History =Prairie States era= KSLN-TV was built by Prairie States Broadcasting Company, a business of Mel and Tom Gleason of York, Nebraska which owned two stations in that state. The station's studios and transmitter were located on the 10th floor of the United Building in downtown Salina. Getting it there was an arduous effort in which the transmitter was hoisted under the building's elevator, which then had to be sent all the way to the top and hand-cranked to the elevator headhouse to bring the equipment to the 10th floor; the transmitter also had to be twisted to fit through the elevator shaft. Even though equipment was being installed as early as November 1960, KSLN-TV did not sign on until January 2, 1962, with a dual affiliation with ABC and NBC. =Sale and new ownership= On May 17, 1963, Prairie States took KSLN-TV off the air and announced that it would sell channel 34 to a new buyer: the Mid- America Broadcasting Company, which also owned the cable television system in Salina. The month before, Prairie States had filed to sell channel 34 to Mid- America for $43,000. An objector soon appeared: the Wichita Television Corporation, owner of the Kansas State Network and applicant for a TV translator of the KSN station at Great Bend, KCKT, which would serve Salina. Wichita Television claimed that the sale of KSLN to Salina's cable system created a conflict of interest. The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale in February 1964, saying that the CATV system was small‚Äîwith just 122 subscribers‚Äîand that Prairie States had been forced to pull the plug on channel 34 due to financial difficulties. The general manager of Mid-America announced that the station would make technical improvements in new equipment and modernized studios. KSN maintained its filing for the KCKT translator on channel 74 and took out a full-page ad in the Salina Journal congratulating Mid-America on its purchase of KSLN-TV‚Äîthe very purchase to which it had objected‚Äîand touting its attempts to build the translator to give Salina reliable NBC network service. KSLN-TV returned to air August 1, 1964, once more as Salina's ABC affiliate. Channel 34 complemented the ABC lineup with local newscasts and an afternoon children's show known as Bar 34. =In pursuit of VHF= However, Mid-America was not able to profitably run KSLN-TV, just as Prairie States had failed. In late October 1965, the station announced it would ask for authority to \\"temporarily\\" cease operations effective November 1 and begin a fight to get a VHF television channel allocated to Salina; channel 34's management said that \\"every possible effort\\" would be made to reopen KSLN-TV as a VHF station. The KSLN bid to bring VHF television to Salina‚Äîwhose assigned channels were 18, 34, and 44‚Äîwould have changed the educational assignment of channel 9 at Lincoln Center to channel 6, and substituted commercial channel 9 for channel 34 in Salina. The Lincoln Center assignment would necessitate a waiver of station spacing rules. In its arguments, Mid-America stated that the conversion rate of VHF sets to tune its channel 34 station was low, and that KSLN-TV had ceased operations twice for financial reasons. Mid-America's own studies found that the conversion rate in Salina was 20 to 30 percent; a 1966 American Research Bureau study commissioned by KSN pegged the figure at 36 percent inside the city and just 8 percent outside of it. It further argued that KSLN-TV could not compete with advertising dollars with the VHF stations in town, which included the network stations in Wichita as well as KCKT and ABC affiliate KHTL-TV of Superior, Nebraska, and that the KSN translator (K74CN) had contributed to channel 34's financial woes. However, Mid-America's filing presented station spacing challenges. It proposed that the channel 6 allocation be able to locate its transmitter with KSLN-TV in Salina. However, channel 6 there would be short spaced by to KTVC at Ensign, Kansas. While local business groups in Salina supported the position, other broadcasters, including the channel 6 stations in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Omaha, Nebraska, filed oppositions, as did KSN. The other broadcasters claimed that Mid-America had not done enough to promote UHF television in Salina, failing to do any promotion whatsoever, and that its minimal facilities made it a \\"glorified translator\\". The FCC, in its decision on January 10, 1968, denied the petition from Mid-America, saying that Salina was still an area for potential development of UHF, that it had inadequate VHF service, that Mid-America would be better served trying to increase KSLN-TV's power, and that the changing of the educational assignment to channel 6 would create a \\"degraded and limiting\\" facility that could not provide appropriate service. Some of channel 34's equipment, still owned by the Salina cable system, was loaned to help the Kansas State University closed-circuit TV system resume operations after a fire gutted the Nichols Gym where the equipment was located. Later uses of channel 34 at Salina The channel 34 assignment would be occupied in 1971 by translator station K34AA, which relocated from channel 78 (as K78CV). The move marked the return of ABC programming to channel 34, as K34AA was a translator for KAKE-TV of Wichita. K34AA moved to channel 22 as K22CP in 1989 and remains a repeater for KAKE as KHDS-LD. A construction permit for channel 34 was issued in 1984 for a station that would have been known as KHCT; this station, which never signed on, would have been an independent.

He was the first Midrarid ruler to adopt Maliki Sunni Islam.  Biography  He was a son of al-Fath Wasul ibn Maymun al-Amir (), and cousin of his predecessor, al-Muntasir Samgu ibn Muhammad and was an enemy of the Fatimids and supporter of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. It is known that he served in the Umayyad armies in al-Andalus at the Battle of Simancas on August 1, 939, and had converted to Maliki Sunnism, the prevailing madhhab on the Iberian Peninsula. He carried out a coup in 942‚Äì943 against the 13-year-old al-Muntasir and his grandmother who acted as regent, and took the power; al- Muntasir was imprisoned. Considered a partisan of the Umayyads, his assumption of power alarmed the Fatimid Caliph. Muhammad sought the support of the Berbers to make war on the Fatimids. He assumed the caliphal title of amir al- mu'minin and the regnal title al-Shakir li-llah (\\"the grateful one toward God\\") and from 944 to 950 started minting coins called mathaqil shakiriyya. These moves irritated the Fatimid government, which decided to put an end to it. The caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah sent the general Jawhar against Sijilmasa. The general, when he arrived, addressed the notables, demanding the delivery of Ibn Wasul, but they refused; despite this, Ibn Wasul left the city with his family and treasures and his most loyal supporters, towards the fortress of Tasagdalt. On September 958, Jawhar entered the city without fighting and changed the shakiriyya coins to Fatimid coins. Ibn Wasul left his refuge and approached the city to see what was happening.

The bond scam is also regarded as the largest reported financial scam in Sri Lanka despite the country's reputation of having a solid visionary banking system over the years. This was a major blow to the Sri Lankan economy and was also major setback to the newly elected government under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena which commenced its first term as of 8 January 2015. Arjuna Mahendran was appointed as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka replacing Ajith Nivard Cabraal. This bond issue also caused disputes between the Government of Sri Lanka and Government of Singapore over the extradition requests of Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka. On 3 September 2019, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs clarified that the government would consider the extradition request from Sri Lanka once the necessary supporting information and documents were released. In the same month with the approval of Singapore, Sri Lankan government lodged extradition of ex-governor Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka.  Arjuna Mahendran  Arjuna Mahendran, a Singaporean Tamil nationality of Sri Lanka origin was controversially appointed as the CBSL governor in 2015 succeeding Ajith Nivard Gabral. It was reported that the current CBSL governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy was to be appointed to that position but was withdrawn by the latter due to being busy in other projects. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe apparently appointed Arjuna Mahendran as CBSL governor but without the consent of the President.  Background  On 27 February 2015, newly appointed CBSL governor Arjuna Mahendran advertised the sale of Rs. 1 billion in 30 year government bonds at a coupon of 12.5% Despite several accounts erroneously cite an indicative rate of 9.5%. The sale was oversubscribed with 36 bids of totaling Rs. 20 billion. The majority of bidders, 26, bidded for Rs. 100 million or less at a rate of 9.5%‚Äì10.5%. However, a few bidders, including Perpetual Treasuries Limited, wanted interest rates of 11%‚Äì12%. On 27 February 2015, the CBSL accepted Rs. 10 billion in bids at rates of 9.5%‚Äì12.5%, which meant that the base value of the auction doubled twenty times. The issuing of ten times the advertised bonds, and at a higher than expected rate, was alleged to cost the Sri Lankan government an additional Rs. 1.6 billion ($ 10.6 million), though this alleged loss was disputed by the Leader of the House of Parliament. A petition was lodged in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka contesting the methodology used to allege such a loss. Perpetual Treasuries was issued, directly and indirectly, with Rs. 5 billion in bonds at 12.5%. Perpetual Treasuries was one of the primary dealers in the sale and is owned by Mahendran's son-in-law Arjun Aloysius. The primary dealer had also appointed the sister of the former Central Bank Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal onto the Board of its holding company.  Aftermath  This situation became a controversial political issue in Sri Lanka as the newly elected Sri Lankan Government of President Maithreepala Sirisena came to power with a slogan of good governance in the country. A three-member Committee of eminent lawyers was appointed to investigate the issue and the report produced by the committee claimed that there was no direct involvement by Mahendran in the deal. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka did not grant leave to proceed in a fundamental rights case that requested a separate inquiry into the bond issue, as no laws were broken. Mahendran denied any wrongdoing in the controversial bond auction and asserted that he was ready to face any inquiry to prove his innocence. He also said he had been made a victim due to his own transparency. I‚Äôm a victim of my own transparency ‚Äì CB Governor Mahendran http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/13/im-a- victim-of-my-own-transparency-cb-governor-mahendran.html On the other hand, former governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ajith Nivard Cabraal who preceded Mahendran charged that a higher hand was involved in the scandal given the scale of the cover-up attempts by the Sri Lankan government.INTERVIEW: Higher hand involved in bond scam http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/20/major-mission-to-cover-up-bond-scam.html Cabraal himself is the subject of several investigations by the law enforcement authorities on alleged misconduct during his tenure as Governor.  Investigations  On 28 October 2016, the Committee On Public Enterprises, after a lengthy investigation, found Mahendran responsible for the Bond Issue Scam and recommended legal action be taken against the above.Mahendran responsible for CB Bond scam: COPE report http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Mahendran-responsible-for-CB-Bond-scam-COPE- report--118266.htmlMahendran responsible for CB Bond scam: COPE report http://newsfirst.lk/english/2016/10/cope-report-former-cbsl-governor-arjuna- mahendran-found-accountable-bond-scam/153007 However President Maithripala Sirisena has announced that he had appointed a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry to further investigate the case. This commission consisted of commission‚Äôs chairman Justice K. T. Chitrasiri and members Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and retired Deputy Auditor General, V. Kandasamy. During the inquiry, Mahendran defended his actions before the Commission stating that he had not acted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the Government. Prasanna Jayawardena was appointed to the Supreme Court as a judge by President Maithripala Sirisena in June 2016. In January 2017, he was appointed by President Sirisena to a three member Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry in the investigate the Bond Issuance at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which published its report in December 2017. The commission handed over the report on Central Bank bond issuance to the President Maithripala Sirisena on 30 December 2017 and the Presidential Secretariat made available the full report in PDF form from its website for public viewing. In the findings of the report, Arjuna Mahendra was held directly responsible for causing a loss of LKR 11,145 million to public institutions. However, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced that 'No financial loss will be caused to the government on account of the Central Bank Bond issue since the government will recover the Rs 9.2 billion involved from Perpetual Treasures Ltd. according to the procedure recommended by the Presidential Commission. The Central Bank functioning under the Ministry of National Policy has already blocked and retained a fund of Rs 12 billion belonging to the Perpetual Treasures Ltd' The prolonged nature of the inquiry may be linked to a growing rift between Sri Lanka's President and Prime Minister and the two political parties they each represent in an increasingly fraught coalition government. A group of ministers from the President's party along with opposition MPs failed in a recent attempt to pass a motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister in Sri Lanka's Parliament. A key issue in the motion was the Prime Minister's alleged interference in the Central Bank. The President has subsequently had to prorogue Parliament In 2016 October COPE revealed that Governor of the Central Bank Arjuna Mahendran should be held responsible for the Bond Issue Scam and legal action should be taken against him.Sri Lanka: COPE report on CB bond issue presented in Parliament http://www.slguardian.org/2016/10/sri- lanka-cope-report-on-cb-bond-issue-presented-in-parliament/ However President Maithripala Sirisena has announced that he has appointed a Commission of Inquiry to further investigate the case. In March 2019, President of Sri Lanka revealed that Singapore didn't respond to his phone call in early January in a request to return Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka for inquiries and he also slammed the Singaporean government of sheltering the suspect. But the allegations were refuted by Singapore and revealed Colombo failed to provide valid documents and evidences on deporting of Mahendran to Sri Lanka.

Thompson, true to form, insists on keeping his options open -- the trumpeter sees no reason why he cannot be influenced by Freddie Hubbard one minute and Lester Bowie the next. As a result, Talking Horns is unpredictable -- you never know from one track to the next if the sextet will go in a straight-ahead post-bop direction or an AACM-influenced avant-garde direction. But whatever direction the sextet chooses, this album is consistently strong and serves as a fine example of Midwestern acoustic jazz\\". In JazzTimes Aaron Steinberg wrote \\"Talking Horns isn‚Äôt really a recording of manifesto-fueled excitement or much of a departure for the trumpeter, however. Thompson‚Äôs outfit reinvestigates familiar territory-robust hard-bop edged with squeally outbursts-with moderation and restraint. On the mostly vamp or groove-based tunes, the rhythm section ticks off measures without any real sense of urgency. Even free-blown passages come across as a little tame. Thompson himself plays with a big, brassy sound but turns in able if not particularly memorable solos\\".Steinberg, A.

He and World Saxophone Quartet alumni, Oliver Lake and Hamiet Bluiett, acquit themselves famously in this endeavor and offer a tasty plate of avant-garde music ... Talking Horns captures the essence of jazz that the best albums do: heavy, fat groovin‚Äô that sways the body combined with incisive, intelligent improvisation that excites the mind\\".AAJ Staff All About Jazz Review 1 accessed October 28, 2019 Mark Corroto was less impressed noting \\"The good news is trumpeter Malachi Thompson mixes multiple styles and approaches on his latest release.

Oliger was the co- founder of the Science in Computational and Mathematical Engineering degree program at Stanford, and served as the director of the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science. Early life and education Oliger was born in Indiana in 1941, the son of salesman Emmert Oliger and homemaker Catherine Oliger, and grew up on a farm in Greensburg, Indiana. Oliger graduated from the University of Colorado with a B.S. in mathematics in 1966, and later continued on to complete an M.S. in applied math in 1971. From 1965 to 1973, Oliger worked as a computer programmer and analyst at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. There, Oliger met Heinz-Otto Kreiss, who was a professor at Uppsala University at the time, and they began working together. Kreiss became Oliger‚Äôs PhD advisor, and Oliger completed his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1973. Research focus Oliger is known for his work on numerical methods to approximate solutions of partial differential equations, with applications to weather forecasting. For example in his early work with Heinz in 1972, for a model problem on wave propagation Oliger determined to what order of Fourier analysis was required to guarantee a desired level of accuracy. Along with Marsha Berger and Philip Colella, Oliger developed the technique of adaptive mesh refinement. One adaptive mesh refinement algorithm first developed by Berger and Oliger, and later refined by Berger and Colella, is taught today and referred to as the Berger-Oliger or Berger-Oliger-Colella method. Stanford University In 1974, Oliger joined the Computer Science department at Stanford University as an assistant professor. In 1987, Oliger co-founded the Science in Computational and Mathematical Engineering degree program at Stanford with three colleagues. As a professor at Stanford, Oliger graduated over 20 PhD students and currently has over 100 academic descendants.

Thompson and his notion of reinventing the manner in which a brass-driven big band explores the relationships between harmony and rhythm, and the more tenacious linguistic commonalities between bebop and free jazz have never been as articulately or gracefully rendered as they are in this pair of suites. The band is stellar ... The two suites, \\"Black Metropolis\\" and \\"Blues for a Saint Called Louis,\\" are stunning compositions in and of themselves. ... The spirit is raucous, joyous, and utterly sophisticated; it looks forward and back across 20 years of Thompson's own free bop amalgam, but also through the entirety of jazz history. The album is, simply put, a singular achievement and one of the great big band records in recent years, and a serious candidate for big band album of 2003\\". In JazzTimes John Litweiler observed \\"Trumpeter Thompson solos at length throughout Blue Jazz. He‚Äôs a fanciful player, a master of the lyrical side of ‚Äô50s late-bop players ...

Final voyage and stranding  May Queen, inward bound from London carrying 1,200 tons of cargo, approached Lyttelton Heads on 26 January 1888. A pilot from the port boarded the ship outside the heads, and beat up against a strong, uncertain breeze. The pilot took the vessel too close to the south shore of Lyttelton Harbour, near Red Rock. A squall called the ship to miss stays, and it was carried on to the rocks. A tug from the port endeavoured to tow May Queen free, but failed. The ship had run aground at high tide; as the tide ebbed the ship became lodged on the rocks. Rocks penetrated the hull, and boats from the port discharged most of the cargo before the ship became a total wreck. May Queen was abandoned to the underwriters on 27 January 1888.  Salvage  Between 500 and 600 tons of cargo was salved from the wreck, along with various cabin fittings. A mahogany sideboard and couch from May Queen are now displayed at Lyttelton Museum.

He was a professor, chief medical doctor and director at the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He worked in public health for almost six decades, including more than 30 years in HIV/AIDS epidemiology and management.  Biography  Kang was born on 17 September 1936 in Fenghua, Zhejiang, Republic of China. After graduating from Shanghai Medical College in 1957, he taught at Shanghai Medical Specialty School for five years. In August 1962, Kang transferred to the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention and worked there for the rest of his career. From 1984 to 1986, he received further training in epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto in Canada. After returning to China in December 1986, he worked in the prevention and treatment of the new disease AIDS. He was appointed Director of the Shanghai AIDS Monitoring Center in October 1991 and Deputy Director of the Shanghai AIDS Research Center in 2001. Kang later served as Chief Medical Doctor and Director at the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and also taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto. Kang died on 5 October 2019, aged 83.  Contributions  In the 1960s, Kang worked for years on cholera prevention and treatment in the outskirts of Shanghai. He also went to Kashgar, Xinjiang to advise on the management of a cholera outbreak there. In 1970, Kang quickly detected and controlled an anthrax outbreak which killed a large number of mink in the Shanghai Zoo. When a major outbreak of dermatitis affected half a million people in Shanghai in 1972, Kang determined the cause to be caterpillars of the moth Euproctis similis xanthocampa and devised measures to control the disease. From 1978, Kang oversaw the creation of the hepatitis B vaccination program for newborns in Shanghai, the first such program in China. In 1988, when 290,000 people in Shanghai were infected with hepatitis A, Kang conducted research that determined the cause of the outbreak to be consumption of contaminated Anadara subcrenata clams. Starting in the late 1980s, Kang mainly focused on the epidemiology, intervention research, clinical evaluation, and management of HIV/AIDS. In 1989, he established one of China's first labs to isolate and detect the virus. In 1992, he organized a major epidemiological study of hepatitis C and hepatitis E involving nearly 90,000 patients in four provinces. In 1998, he detected the first case of HIV/AIDS in a haemophiliac. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Kang was a key member of the Shanghai SARS prevention group. Kang published more than 20 books and nearly 200 research papers. He received many national and municipal awards including the Distinguished Contribution Award of the National Science Congress, State Science and Technology Progress Award (Third Class), and the Shanghai Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class).

This often refers to removing marine fouling growth from ship hulls, but also has applications on civil engineering structures, pipeline intakes and similar components which are impossible or inconvenient to remove from the water for maintenance. It does not generally refer to cleaning the inside of underwater or other pipelines, a process known as pigging. Many applications require the intervention of a diver, either to provide the power, or to direct a powered tool.  Applications  *Removal of marine fouling for ship performance improvement. *Removal of marine organisms to prevent infestation by alien species. Fouling of ships' bottoms by marine organisms is recognised as a major vector for the introduction of invasive alien species, which can have significant economic and environmental impacts. The risk can be mitigated by maintenance of the immersed surfaces to kill or remove fouling organisms before entry into the protected areas. The usual primary method is the use of anti-fouling coatings, which are themselves an environmental hazard due to toxicity. In-water cleaning is an adjunct to anti-fouling in cases where the coating has not been completely effective, and also carries a biosecurity risk due to the potential release of the removed organisms and toxins from the coatings. *Removal of fouling and contaminants in preparation for inspection, maintenance or repair work. = Ship bottom cleaning =  Methods  Manual methods: * Removal of organisms by hand * Cleaning using scrapers, hand brushes and scouring pads Mechanical methods: * Brushing ‚Äì the use of a tool with bristles to scrape off the contaminants. ** ‚Äì a device which transports powered brushes along the surface to be cleaned. Brush carts do not usually include a system for removal or treatment of waste, but it can be done if there is sufficient demand. Brushes that do not directly contact the surface coating can remove fouling without damaging the coating itself. The standoff can be controlled when the cart rolls over the surface on wheels. Some removal of the surface of some anti-fouling coatings may actually improve the performance by exposing a fresh layer with more concentrated active materials. ** . When correctly applied, high pressure water jetting can provide acceptable levels of cleaning without damaging anti-fouling coatings or releasing toxins to the environment, but this requires fairly accurate control of jet angle and distance from the surface, and duration of impingement. In other circumstances water jetting can be used to remove paint. Water jetting can be applied manually by divers, by diver-operated carts, or by ROVs. Pressures of between 200 and 600 bar may be used in high-pressure water jetting. Cleaning rates are generally lower underwater than with the ship in dry dock, where rates of 200 m2 per hour are possible. Exceptionally heavy fouling may reduce the rate to 20 m2 per hour. With sufficient pressure, (around 750 bar), damaged concrete coating can be removed from steel pipelines without damage to the steel. Special nozzles are available for jetting between parallel surfaces and inside pipes. Jet geometry affects cleaning rate. A round jet has the maximum impact on the contamination, but the area affected is relatively small. A fan jet impinges on a much wider swath, but with less impact, and the width and impact of a fan jet are strongly affected by the distance between the nozzle and the surface. Where a fan jet is effective, the optimum distance and angle can be discovered by experiment, and will often vary across the surface. Soft or resilient deposits may peel off in coherent sheets if jetted at an angle of around 30 to 60¬∞ to the surface. More brittle deposits will tend to break up as they are detached, and may need a jetting angle nearer to perpendicular to the surface. ** . This system is intended to remove contaminants, coatings, and corrosion products down to the substrate. Abrasive grit is entrained in the jet of water and the impact of the grit has an aggressive cleaning action. ** . This system uses jets of water containing cavitation voids of water vapour, generated ultrasonically in the nozzle, which develop high localised impact pressures on hard surfaces when the bubbles implode at the surface to be cleaned. This is claimed to do less damage to surface coatings than high pressure jetting, and reduce the hazard to the operator. The cavitation jet can remove fouling, loose paint and rust, without damage to sound paint when used correctly, but can erode ablative and self-polishing paint coatings if applied too closely or for too long. Tools include hand-held pistols, diver and self-propelled carts and potentially, also robotic systems. Suction systems to recover waste are available, and the waste can be treated or filtered.  Capture and treatment of waste products  Depending on the reason for bottom cleaning, it may be desirable to capture and treat the waste dislodged from the surface. If the purpose is to remove potentially invasive alien species, then they must be removed from the water or killed. If the organisms are not a problem, it may be necessary to contain released toxins from the anti-fouling coating.  Environmental impact  In- water cleaning of structures and vessels may distribute the surface contaminants in an area where they could be harmful. There are two main concerns: *Release of potentially invasive alien organisms. This is mainly a problem when the fouled surface is on a vessel which has traveled from a different ecological region, and is covered with species alien to the region where it is cleaned. *Release of toxins which may degrade the local environment. This is a concern where the surface has a layer of antifouling paint under the fouling layer.  Effects on substrate Some cleaning technologies can cause significant damage or degradation of the substrate, particularly removal or excessive abrasion of protective or biologically active surface coatings. In some cases removal of the upper layer of an anti- fouling paint can expose paint which has a stronger concentration of active biocides, which can reactivate the paint.

S. Jeyram. The film features J. Livingston, Vignesh and Anju Aravind in lead roles, with M. S. Viswanathan, Sabitha Anand, Thalaivasal Vijay, Indhu, Ravi Rahul, Baby Subhashree, and Nizhalgal Ravi playing supporting roles. The film, produced by Selvarani Rajendran, had musical score by Deva and was released on 6 October 2000. Plot The film begins with the college student and drug addict Karthik (Vignesh) stabbing a professor with a knife on a college campus. Karthik is therefore arrested. However, the professor survived the assault, and the court acquits Karthik of the crime, considering that he is a college student. Karthik, who is from a wealthy family, is also a misogynist. In the past, Karthik lived happily with his father Muthusamy (M. S. Viswanathan), mother Rajeshwari (Sabitha Anand) and elder brother Chandrasekharan (Thalaivasal Vijay). Chandrasekharan had a marriage arranged with Chithra (Indhu), who was more educated than him, and she later gave birth to Lakshmi (Baby Subhashree). Chithra became sick of living in a traditional joint family, and the couple left the home with their child to live elsewhere. Chithra was still unhappy about being a housewife. One day, her childhood friend Amit (Ravi Rahul) met her and got closer to her. They even had an affair. When Chandrasekharan comes to know about their affair, he forcefully took his wife's thaali around her neck and kicked her out of his house. Afterward, Chithra filed a complaint to the police station against Chandrasekharan and Muthusamy. At the police station, Chithra and Chandrasekharan got divorced, and Chithra won the custody of her child. The news spread like wildfire, and the matter brought shame upon their family. Rajeshwari then died of a heart attack, Chandrasekharan became mentally ill, and Karthik became a misogynist and a drug addict. Back to the present, Karthik has a car accident, and Seetha (Anju Aravind) saves him by giving him her blood. Seetha is none other than Lakshmi's school teacher. Karthik then becomes a good person and falls under the spell of Seetha. In the meantime, Chithra commits suicide because she was ill-treated by society for her extramarital affair. Karthik finally expresses his love for Seetha, and she tells him about her bitter past. In the past, Kalyana Sundaram (J. Livingston) was a kindhearted pickpocket who put money aside to build a school for poor children. Kalyana Sundaram and Seetha fell in love with each other, and she helped him financially build his school. The day before the school opening ceremony, Seetha's father (Nizhalgal Ravi), who was against their love, sent goons to kill Kalyana Sundaram, who was heavily wounded in the process. At the school opening ceremony, Kalyana Sundaram attended the function but died of wounds at the end of the ceremony. Back to the present, Seetha tells Karthik that she cannot forget Kalyana Sundaram and can never fall in love again with one more man. Karthik, who is saddened by her past, genuinely accepts his fate and realizes that hating all the women because of one woman's mistake was foolish. Cast *J.

The burial was excavated by Ukrainian- born archaeologist Ivan Borkovsk√Ω as part of a Czech National Museum project. The skeleton was dated to the 9th or 10th century AD and was associated with high-value burial goods. Ethnic identification of the deceased has proved controversial. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in the Second World War, Borkovsk√Ω was forced to withdraw a book he had published identifying early Slavic influence in the region. He was also forced to publish a journal article identifying the burial as Germanic or Nordic, to support a Nazi claim of early German involvement in the region. After the end of the war and with Prague under Soviet occupation Borkovsk√Ω published a paper retracting his earlier work and identifying IIIN199 as a nobleman of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. The skeleton was kept in storage until 2004 and, though it has been tested extensively since then, a definitive identification has not been possible.  Discovery  The third courtyard of Prague Castle The skeleton was discovered in the third courtyard of Prague Castle on 11 July 1928 by Ukrainian-born archaeologist Ivan Borkovsk√Ω, who was leading a National Museum excavation project. The project was investigating a burial ground thought to be associated with an early hill fort on the site of Prague Castle (and dating to AD 800‚Äì1000). It was a continuation of work begun in 1925 by Karel Guth, the head of the National Museum's archaeological department, that sought to identify archaeology associated with Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia. Borkovsk√Ω did not initially write a paper on the discovery of the skeleton as he was of insufficient academic rank, being only an assistant to the head of archaeology at the museum. Guth himself tended to publish papers a long time after excavation, and these often contained little detail. Borkovsk√Ω was more prominent by the 1930s but was keen to keep a low profile on the potentially controversial matter of ethnic identification of the burial as he was seeking to obtain Czechoslovak nationality. The body belonged to a male; he was likely buried around AD 800‚Äì1000 and was given the identification number IIIN199. It was found just below the courtyard surface and was in a wooden chamber measuring by , which was probably originally covered by a burial mound. The courtyard was constructed as part of a rebuilding of the castle in the late 11th century, and the graveyard was partially levelled to accommodate it. However, the integrity of graves seems to have been respected, and the courtyard's slabs successfully protected IIIN199 until the 20th- century. IIIN199 was found to be exceptionally tall for the period, some in height, with robust bones that suggested a muscular build. The skeleton was buried lying on his back with his head angled to the left. The skeleton's right hand was found to be resting on the handle of a metre-long iron sword, which was the only sword to be found in all 1,500 early medieval graves excavated at the castle. Two knives were located near the body's left hand, and at the right elbow an object was found that could have been either a razor or a fire steel, which would have been an important status symbol. At the skeleton's feet were a small wooden bucket (often used by Vikings as ceremonial drinking vessels) and an iron axe head. Near the pelvis were found remains of a leather bag that held a small, decorated flint.  Historical identification  Adolf Hitler and German soldiers in Prague Castle, 1939 Czechoslovakia was invaded by Germany in 1939. The occupying German forces were keen to provide proof of Germanic heritage in the region. They accused Borkovsk√Ω of not publishing the discovery of the skeleton as they claimed it was of a German or Nordic man, not of a Slav. They forced him, under threat of being sent to a concentration camp, to withdraw a book he published that identified pottery remains he had found as the oldest Slavic pottery in Europe. The Nazis destroyed most copies of the book. When Borkovsk√Ω did eventually publish the finding of the remains, his paper supported the \\"Nazi- influenced Nordic interpretation\\". The paper's original title was \\"A warrior grave from Prague Castle\\", but it was amended before publication to \\"A Viking grave from Prague Castle\\" by Lothar Zotz, the German historian who edited the Altb√∂hmen und Altm√§hren journal. The paper linked the trefoil decoration on the fire steel to similar designs on German axes and the sword to one found in German Silesia. Soviet and Czechoslovak Army personnel in the castle in June 1945 Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Borkovsk√Ω narrowly escaped being sent to a Soviet gulag as he was accused of collaboration with the Nazis. After explaining he had been forced to write the pro-Nazi paper, he published a second article on the skeleton in 1946 that identified the subject as a noble of the early P≈ôemyslid dynasty. This identification of the skeleton had been earlier expounded by Borkovsk√Ω's superior at the National Museum. Borkovsk√Ω's 1946 paper identified IIIN199 as an 860s AD burial, predating Christian influence in the area. Reassessment of the identification of IIIN199 was not possible during the Cold War due to the political ramifications, though anthropologist Emanuel Vlƒçek published a paper in the 1970s that claimed the burial must be later in the 9th century and not related to the P≈ôemyslids.  Modern assessment  The remains and grave goods were kept in storage and away from public view until 2004. A modern study of the remains identified the fire striker as a common piece of Viking equipment. Indeed, the majority of the skeleton's possessions have been identified as resembling Viking equipment. The sword has been identified as a high-quality item almost certainly crafted in Western Europe. It is of a type used by the Vikings in northern, western and central Europe. The knives and bucket have been identified as being manufactured near Prague. The cause of death has not been determined, but the man is thought to have died at around age 50. Analysis of the Strontium isotopes in the skeleton's teeth has shown that he grew up in Northern Europe, likely on the southern Baltic coast or in Denmark. This area was home to the Vikings, Slavs and Baltic tribes. Jan Frolik of the Czech Academy of Sciences has suggested that the individual came to Prague as a young man to serve the early dukes of Bohemia (either Bo≈ôivoj I or Spytihnƒõv I). These dukes founded the P≈ôemyslid dynasty from their seat at Prague Castle. Due to the complex national identities of early-Medieval Europe, it is possible that the individual regarded himself as a Viking, a Slav or both. This is reflected by the mixed origin of his possessions. Due to his high- status grave goods and prominent burial location, the man likely held a position of prominence in the castle. The University of Helsinki is working on DNA analysis of the skeleton that may help to provide more information on his ethnicity. The amount of modern testing carried out on IIIN199 has been described as second only to the remains of √ñtzi the Iceman. The conflicting assessments of IIIN199 have been described as reflecting \\"the fate of Czechoslovakia and Central Europe, as the burial became entangled with Czech identity, Nazi occupation and the manipulation of archaeology\\".

In 2018, TGP was awarded the contract for project logistics management for a shipment of equipment and construction materials to the British Antarctic Survey‚Äôs (BAS) Rothera Research Station at Rothera Point by BAM, a global construction and engineering company. The equipment and materials were to be used to build a new wharf to house the UK's new state-of- the-art polar research vessel RSS Sir David Attenborough. TGP completed the shipment's discharge in January 2019, and as a result of the Antarctica project's success, the company is currently shortlisted for \\"Excellence in Engineering\\" at the 2019 Heavy Lift Awards. Today, TGP operates all over the world and is represented by more than 30 offices across six continents.

Early life  Bessie Charles and her sister Ethel Charles were born in Calcutta, Bengal India, to Thomas Edmonton Charles (1834‚Äì1906), a doctor in private practice, and Ada Henrietta Charles (1848‚Äì1931/2). The family left India in 1877, settling at first in Cannes, then for twenty years spent their summers in Switzerland and winters in Rome, and visiting to England annually. Ethel and Bessie Charles were both educated privately and together read modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford for a year in 1891‚Äì2. Despite being presented at court, their father encouraged both daughters to explore a profession.  Career  Between 1892‚Äì5 Bessie and Ethel were articled to Sir Ernest George and Peto, the architectural practice of Ernest George and Harold Peto. In 1892 they were proposed for membership of the Architectural Association School of Architecture, but withdrew after opposition. They attended the school of architecture at The Bartlett (University College London), studying architecture as a fine art, a course in architectural history (second class certificates, 1892‚Äì3); however, they did not take the professional elements of the programme, which were not thought appropriate for women students. They were the first women to study architecture at UCL. In 1900, Bessie took the qualifying examination for the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and was elected, one year after Ethel. From 1898 to 1905 Ethel and Bessie Charles lived together in Marylebone, London, which provided accommodation for single professional women. Both sisters lived from time to time in the family home in Camberley, Surrey, but they shifted the focus of their architectural practice to Clift Cottage in Flushing, Cornwall. Their most notable work is the Bible Christian Chapel (now a cinema) in Falmouth, Cornwall (1907).

The premiere of the opera was held on December 25, 1953 at the Azerbaijan State Opera and Ballet Theater. Sevil is the first Azerbaijani opera written in a modern lyrical and psychological genre. The melody, which is the main expression of Fikrat Amirov's work, plays an emotional beginning in the music of the opera. The composer used a variety of musical forms in the opera - aria, ariozo, ensembles and choral episodes.  History  Fikrat Amirov started to write the opera in 1949. Writing the opera's libretto, the poet Talat Eyyubov tried to keep the play's main essence. Some scenes of the play have been combined with the requirements of the opera genre, and the work has been compact. Jafar Jabbarly Fikret Amirov, who mainly kept the idea and plot of Jafar Jabbarly's play, made some changes in the opera to deepen the social features. The second scene incorporates non-revolutionary demonstration scenes, proloquia at the beginning of the opera, and scenes from the third scene. The work also features other opera genres (especially the historical genre). Taking into consideration the development, composition, dramatic structure of events in the opera, etc., it seems the composer has benefited from classics, in particular the traditions of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky's dramatics. However, the compositional methods of classical operas are synthesized in the opera \\"Sevil\\" with the national folklore of the musical language and with all modern intonation vocabulary.  Music  The opera combines two opposing social forces, represented by the progressive group of characters (Sevil and her friends) and the ‚Äúdying world‚Äù (Balash and his environment). The contradictions of the social and psychological merits of the participants create a contradiction between the image-thematic and the compositional structure in the opera. The work was originally consists of 4 scenes. But later it was edited by the author to adapt to the 3- and 2-page versions. Fikrat Amirov The work consists of an introduction, three acts and two drawings. The first act features Sevil's sad arios and song. Ariozo is written in the spirit of folk songs. The second act consists of three parts. The third part is march music, which consists of separate replicas of Seville in the background of ‚ÄúWarszawianka‚Äù. The opera opens with a very unusual overtones. It has a very interesting structure: the introduction of the symphonic orchestra, the call of the caller, the female chorus.Thus, the overgrowth prolog consists of three parts. The first and third sections are instrumental. The central part of the overture-prologue is vocal. The orchestra entry to Aria is based on the personal tragedy of Sevil and Balash (main characters). The theme of the first part is bayat-shiraz. The final duo of Sevil and Balash is still on their personal tragedy leitmotif. In the final edit, the scene ends with this duet. The dramatic conflict in the opera is based on the discovery of two conflicting character groups. The first group is represented by the people, and the second group is the vulgar environment. Representatives of the vulgar environment are opened in a comic-satirical manner by Abdulbay and Mammadali bay. At the opening of the pair, grotesque cartoons sometimes appear. In the duo of Abdulbay and Mammadali bay, the dining genre features. The waltz, one of the brightest instrumental numbers in the opera, has an important role.  Scene design and choreography  The chief artist of the theater, Eyyub Fataliyev designed the play according to the idea and content. Honored Art Worker Badura created costume designs for Afghan opera. Nijat Malikov and Razia Yusifova, the choreographers of the theater, worked on the chorus with enthusiasm and managed to make it sound good. The chorus in the second act, the final chorus, the proloquent and the epilogue, were particularly influential. Conductor Assistant - Honored artist, orchestra concertmaster Nazim Rzayev has performed various works on string instruments. The People's Artist, Stalin Prize Laureate, Artistic Director, Niyazi masterfully opened the composer's compositions, created harmony between the orchestra and individual soloists, choral and dance, and promoted orchestrated professionalism.

Also known as the Straight Mile, the embankment is long and the canal runs up to above the valley floor. The structure was chosen as one of the original Seven Wonders of the Waterways, and has been awarded a Red Wheel by the Transport Trust. Background The building of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal began in 1770, but work on the over-budget project was suspended during the American War of Independence, leaving separate sections extending from the two cities. Under the original plan, the canal's route would have passed Burnley on the northern side of the River Calder, crossing at Whalley via an aqueduct. Burnley would have been connected by a branch heading up the valley. Before work on the canal resumed heading west from Gargrave, in 1790, permission was obtained to move the route to the south, with the river crossing between Filly Close in Reedley Hallows and Ightenhill. By the fourth Leeds and Liverpool Canal Act of 1794, this part of the route was settled, moving south again. At Burnley, the River Calder and its tributary the Brun meet in a broad valley, building the crossing still further up the Calder was considered, but the Towneley family objected to the canal coming so close to Towneley Hall. Construction The embankment was built between 1796 and 1801 as an alternative to lock flights on each side of the valley. The embankment was designed by Robert Whitworth, who oversaw its construction until his death in 1799; he was succeeded by former inspector of works Samuel Fletcher. The construction of the embankment cost ¬£22,000 (about ¬£1.6 million in 2019). The embankment used of earth, much of which came from the digging of the nearby Gannow Tunnel and the Whittlefield cutting. The earthwork is long, it is aligned approximately north/south with the towpath on the western side. At the northern end was the Bank Hall estate, owned by John Hargreaves. The estate is now the site of Thompson Park, where the Sandy Holme Aqueduct carries the canal over the River Brun. Here, Godley Lane had to be diverted to meet the bridge that was constructed. While at the southern end, Finsley was presumably a farm before the arrival of the canal saw it converted into a wharf and important maintenance yard. The 1700 house became the home of the engineer who operated the swing bridge originally thought to be a sufficient crossing for Finsley Gate. About halfway along the embankment, the canal crosses Yorkshire Street (previously known as East Gate)‚Äîthe only method of crossing the waterway at any point along its length. This is known as \\"The Culvert\\", although it is an aqueduct not a culvert. This was originally constructed in 1797 as a single horseshoe archway, from end to end, with a maximum height above the roadway of and maximum width of . A sandstone retaining wall on the east side of the embankment, immediately north of Yorkshire Street, features four lime kilns built at the time of the embankment. A further two kilns, on the west side of the embankment, were built to provide lime mortar for masonry and clay for puddling the canal.Plaque installed on remains of lime kilns, dated 1984 The River Calder aqueduct The aqueduct over the River Calder is closer to the southern end, having been built between 1795 and 1796. Visually similar to the original road crossing, the portals are described as a \\"single semi-circular- headed arch with radiating voussoirs\\". There are pilasters to either side of the arch with many of the stone blocks decorated with shortbread vermiculation, and tapered wings support the surrounding earth. Considerable time had to be allowed for the embankment to settle before it was stable enough to carry water, but once it was ready the canal opened to Clayton-le- Moors in 1801. Operational history The town lies at the centre of the Burnley Coalfield, and the canal was routed through the town to provide transportation for the coal industry. During the first half of the 19th century, Fulledge Colliery to the east side of the embankment was linked to the canal by a tramroad. On the other side, the Burnley Drift passed under the southern end. A mine owned by Rev. Hargreaves caused a major collapse of the embankment as it extracted coal from directly underneath. The Calder culvert had to be partly rebuilt. There was also a short dock branch for coal loading at the very end, next to Finsley Gate. In the latter half of the century, the older coalmines closed and their sites were built over, but the embankment continued to be used by the colliers. The coal dock at the south end was filled in, superseded by a coal yard connected to Towneley Colliery, located next to Finsley Wharf. Although the tramroad from Fulledge was removed, another was added on the opposite bank to supply the town's gasworks on the south side of the Calder. Another coal yard was established on the east side of the embankment, next to Central Mill, connected by a more complex system of tramroads that allowed coal to be delivered from Rowley and Bee Hole pits‚Äîopened in 1862 and 1872 respectively‚Äîand raise it up to a wharf. A triangular stone structure that survives on the canal side here probably supported a return wheel for the system. The central part of the embankment, with the chimney of Central Mill visible Another change that may have influenced the altered route of the canal was the rapid growth in the cotton industry here after 1780. The area between the south end of Church Street and the embankment became dominated by factories during the early 19th century. The earliest factory development was Scar Top Mill, built as a woollen mill in 1787 and later used for cotton spinning. This was joined by Hill Top Mill in 1820 and Rishton Mill after 1830. Later they were extended, with Hill Top and Rishton mills expanding up the embankment to access to the towpath. By the turn of the 20th century, twelve mills were operating alongside the embankment‚Äîall but two of which supported the town's textiles industry. Their location was likely influenced by the decision the canal proprietors took in the 1840s to allow water to be taken from the canal to power the mill engines. The embankment, carrying the canal above the mills, provided a suitable head of water for the mill owners and sluices were built to control abstraction. Both Hill Top and Rishton mills, once among the town's largest cotton mills, were demolished to make way for an Odeon Cinema which was built in 1937. Other businesses which used the embankment included three corn mills that had been established on the western side by 1851. The oldest, built in 1809 a little way south of Yorkshire Street, had already been converted for other uses. Both Hill Top, built around 1838, and Pilling Field (1825) mills had been constructed up the embankment, with direct access to the towpath. Pilling Field‚Äîalso known as Aqueduct Mill‚Äîwas the last corn mill to close in Burnley; production ended in 1912 and it was demolished in 1939 after John Greenwood and Sons was taken over by Rank Hovis McDougall. Also at the north end, a rope walk was established on the embankment, parallel to the canal. = Influence on Burnley = The Culvert aqueduct over Yorkshire Street in 2007 The canal embankment shaped the built environment in Burnley. At the time of its construction, the embankment was on the periphery of the town centre and followed a route through open fields. With Burnley becoming a port on the canal, the town expanded during the 19th century‚Äîthe population doubled in the first 20 years‚Äîand land near the canal was used for terraced housing (including some back-to-backs) and numerous cotton mills, warehouses and wharves. Although the arrival of the canal was a very significant event in the growth and development of Burnley, stimulating the local textile and coal trade, the embankment became a physical barrier to the eastward expansion of the town. By 1851, buildings occupied much of the space on the western side, but only a small area around the recently opened St Mary's Church to the east. At this time Burnley Wood was still developing as a discrete settlement. In 1878 Godley Lane was closed to be replaced by Ormerod Road, and the Finsley Gate swing bridge was replaced with a fixed one in 1885. Two side tunnels (known as the \\"gimlet holes\\") were added to The Culvert in 1896 to allow pedestrians to cross the embankment without using the main portal. The entire Culvert was rebuilt in 1926 and 1927, increasing the height and widening the aperture to ‚Äîthe 1797 structure (and additional pedestrian tunnels) were no longer suitable for the increased traffic, the expansion of the Burnley Corporation Tramways, and the introduction of double-decker bus services. On the aqueduct is a crane, used for the movement of stop planks to temporarily dam the canal for maintenance. Legacy In 1997, the aqueduct over the River Calder, situated within the embankment, was given Grade II listed status. The four lime kilns near The Culvert gained the same status at the same time. In June 2012, a Transport Trust Red Wheel commemorated the engineering of the waterway, stating that it was the \\"largest canal embankment in Britain\\".

Life Clarksone was possibly born in Lanark in 1584 and certainly died there in 1625. She is known because of the conversations that she had with her minister William Livingstone. He published a book after her death recording the dialogue between himself and Clarksone for three and a half years prior to her death. The book aims to present her eventual recognition of her faith although critics have noted that it appears to focus more on the intercessions of the minister (and author). The book claims to be a revised edition, but only one edition appears to have ever existed. The book is one of several published but a reviewer has felt that this is the most unconvincing book. Livingstone did not witness her death and had to rely on others to record her \\"victorious faith\\" as she \\"raised her eyes to heaven\\". Clarksone died in Lanark in 1625, and the book by her minister was published in 1630. Only one copy of the book now exists and it is held in the British Library.

He is best known for being the commander of dive bomber squadron of carrier Sh≈çkaku and for leading strikes against United States Navy (USN) carriers in both Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where they severely damaged Enterprise on two separate occasions. He was killed in action during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Early career Mamoru Seki came from a military family; his father was a Captain in IJN and participated in Battle of Tsushima, while his uncle on mother's side was Vice Admiral Sakonji Seiz≈ç. He enrolled in the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1926 and graduated from 58th class in November 1930. In April 1932, he was commission as Ensign. In 1933, he was selected for a navy pilot training program at Tateyama Training Naval Air Station (NAS). He became one of the first pilots in IJN that specialized in dive bombing and conducted pioneering research and development of dive bombing technique. After that, he served as an instructor at Kasumigaura NAS near Tokyo. Later on, Seki became a flight division leader (buntaich≈ç) in dive bomber squadron of carrier Ry≈´j≈ç and participated in Canton Operation during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938. In October 1941, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. He was then transferred to Usa NAS in ≈åita Prefecture on Kyushu and served as an instructor when the Pacific War started. Pacific War In July 1942, Lieutenant Commander Seki was transferred to the carrier Sh≈çkaku as its group commander (hik≈çtaich≈ç), as well as its dive bomber squadron leader. In late August 1942, he participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. There he led the first strike wave against the USN carriers that consisted of 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 15 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. Lieutenant Keiichi Arima led one of the three flight divisions (ch≈´tai) within his strike force, while fighter escorts were led by Lieutenant Yasuhiro Shigematsu from Sh≈çkaku and Lieutenant Moriyasu Hidaka from Zuikaku. Seki's strike hit Enterprise with three bombs that severely damaged the carrier. The second strike wave, led by Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi of Zuikaku, failed to locate the enemy carriers and therefore missed the opportunity to finish off Enterprise. In late October 1942, Sh≈çkaku participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where Lieutenant Commander Seki led the second strike wave that consisted of 19 Aichi D3A dive bombers, 16 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and nine A6M Zero fighters. Like in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, one of the three flight divisions (ch≈´tai) within his strike force was led by Lieutenant Arima. The Zero fighter escort was led by Lieutenant Hideki Shing≈ç, who was the fighter squadron leader of Sh≈çkaku. Seki's strike hit Enterprise with two bombs and scored one near-miss with another bomb that caused severe damage to the carrier. However, during the attack Lieutenant Commander Seki was hit by anti- aircraft artillery and his D3A caught fire and disintegrated. His bomb missed Enterprise and landed in the water close to the side of the carrier. He was one of many experienced carrier pilots lost in the battle; among them was his academy classmate Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata, who led the first wave strike that crippled Hornet. He was posthumously promoted to Commander.

The 302nd episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on October 30, 2019. The episode centers upon marijuana farmer Randy Marsh's attempts to address his daughter Shelly's \\"marijuana problem,\\" which is tied into the issue of Randy's relationship with the Chinese government, a recurring storyline during the season. A subplot concerns a surprise that awaits Butters Stotch after his visit to an exhibit of Egyptian artifacts at a Denver Museum. Plot Marijuana farmer Randy Marsh, owner of Tegridy Farms, announces a Halloween special promotion to his family. However, his daughter, Shelly, has a \\"marijuana problem\\". She believes it smells bad and makes people \\"dumber than they already are.\\" Randy tries to convince her of the positive benefits of marijuana, but the obstinate Shelly wishes it were illegal again. Randy takes Shelly to an exhibit of ancient Egyptian artifacts at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, having promised her a father-daughter outing during which they could bond, but when he attempts to draw attention to the fact that the ancient Egyptians used hemp rope, she is angered to realize that the trip was another attempt to bring her to his way of thinking about marijuana. Meanwhile, fourth grader Butters Stotch tours the same exhibit as part of his efforts to complete the exhibit's accompanying sticker stamp book. When he comes to the mummy of Egyptian royal Took-Tan-ra, an elderly museum employee warns him that this mummy harbors an \\"ancient love curse\\", and urges him not to put Took-Tan-ra's stamp in his book. Butters ignores the warning, after which the undead mummy of Took-Tan-ra visits Butters in his bedroom one night. Initially horrified at the rampaging monster, Butters then sees that he merely wants to hug Butters and give him a FitBit device as a gift. The grateful Butters informs Took-Tan-ra that he already has one, and will give this new one to a friend, but Took-Tan-ra is enraged and storms out. After the mummy's rampage results in five deaths and property damage, the police visit Butters and relate that the mummy told them about the \\"argument\\" he had with Butters. Butters is astounded that the mummy spoke to the police, who admonish Butters for his \\"hurtful\\" conduct toward Took-Tan-ra. When Butters tells them that he may have been cursed by the mummy, but the police say that Took-Tan-ra told them the reverse. They also inform Butters that he must share in the damages caused by the mummy's rampage, and issue him a summons, advising him and the mummy to stay away from each other. Following more attacks by the mummy, Butters meets with the school counselor, Mr. Mackey, but is incredulous to learn that undead being has also spoken to Mackey, who expresses a sympathetic view of the creature. Butters later meets with his classmates at a fast food restaurant, and tells them that he needs to end the curse, pointing to the endless texts and selfies that Took-Tan-ra sends him, but his classmates, like everyone else, speak as if the fault lies with Butters, and advise him to break things off with him, even as the mummy shows up there to continue his campaign of harassment. Shelly cooks a witch's brew, and recites an accompanying incantation that will grant her revenge. She dumps the brew onto the Halloween Special marijuana, horrifying Randy and his business partner, Towelie. This turns out to be an enhanced growth formula that increases Randy's yield. However, when he refuses to drive Shelly to a book fair on Halloween night, she destroys the packaged Halloween special, prompting Randy to ask the police to put her in jail for the night. She is placed in a cell with Butters, who has been imprisoned because he, not the mummy, \\"manipulates the mummy with his passive-aggressive selfishness\\". At Randy's party, the revelers who smoke the Halloween Special mutate into monsters. Randy is then confronted by an undead Winnie the Pooh, whom Randy murdered in the episode \\"Band in China\\". Other monsters follow, including an unseen Harvey Weinstein, who rapes Randy during his emergency phone call to the police. The police race to Tegridy Farms with Butters, in the hopes that he can use his powers of manipulation to stop the mummy, who they believe is causing the attacks there. However, the horrors Randy experiences are revealed to be a hallucination caused by the mutated marijuana. Shelly ends these hallucinations by brewing an antidote that she throws at Randy. The ranking policeman there, Sergeant Harrison Yates, informs Butters that the mummy was not to blame for the emergency, prompting Butters to apologize to the mummy. The mummy resolves to leave for good, but before doing so, gives Butters a note written in hieroglyphics that translates as \\"I hope you can get the help you need. I can't fix you.\\" Randy awakens three days later, and when his wife, Sharon says he was the only one who enjoyed the Halloween special, he says that he was pretty much the target audience anyway. He is also relieved that he did not really have anal sex with Harvey Weinstein, though he and the family are shocked to find a used condom that gives cause for them to question this. Reception John Hugar with The A.V. Club gave the episode a rating of C+, calling it \\"uneven.\\" He stated that the episode had strong potential but ultimately felt rushed. Joe Matar, writing in Den of Geek, gave the episode a rating of 2 out of 5 stars. He criticized the Tegridy Farms story, which he felt had already been explored in the episode, \\"Shots!!!,\\" and thought that the overall plot was \\"boring.\\" References External links * * \\"What‚Äôs Your Problem?\\" \\"Tegridy Farms Halloween Special\\".

In addition to her work as a jockey, Espie also made pies and pasties for Snow Kenna's Walk-in Picture Show (now known as Pioneer Theatre), and was the barmaid at the Stuart Arms Hotel. For additional wages she also did ironing for single men.
