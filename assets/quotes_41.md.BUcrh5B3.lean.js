This is the mother church to this former county town with its forerunners spanning back to the first Saxon settlements of the 7th century, including a major collegiate church of the European Middle Ages dedicated to the same patron saint. Its name has been used nearby for major street names and in St Mary's Stadium, the city's largest sports stadium. Parts of the church date to the 1880s. In 1914 the sound of its church bells inspired the song, \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\", originally recorded in 1919 by Frances Alda and later sung by Bing Crosby in a film of the same name. Listed building, medieval style architecture and George Edmund Street The church has listed building status expressly due to its church tower and spire being local landmarks. Close to the bombed dockworker's terraces, the interior and walls were gutted in World War II and rebuilt in 1954-6 save for the tower with steeple designed by acclaimed church architect George Edmund Street and its small Baptistery also of 1880 which has a little stained glass by Clayton and Bell. Other craftsmanship in the medieval revival style are reredos depicting the Nativity by the Thomas Earp (sculptor). Its stone-buttressed heavy nave is built of ashlar limestone topped by a slate roof. Its tower has three stages; the upper a broached spire with lucarnes (dormers)s added in 1914, fulfilling Street's wider plans. Location The church stands a few hundred metres east of the high street occupying its own green site at the south end of St. Mary street on the east side. Its grounds also line the north side of Chapel Road. Buildings of Southampton City College are north and east. Urban planners have kept the surroundings low-rise to blend with its quiet green oasis which includes large deciduous trees. The legal protection of the listing of the building, reads: \\"included for fine tower and steeple which are also a local landmark\\". History The present church is the sixth on the site of the Saxon town of Hamwic (Hamtun). First church The first church at Hamwic is thought to have been built around AD 634 when Saint Birinus arrived at the port on his mission to re-convert England to its former Christian faith. About this time, the first small church of St. Mary was built on the present site. During the Viking raids of 994, Olaf I of Norway is believed to have worshipped at the church while camped at Woolston prior to his return to Norway. The first recorded priest and holder of the benefice was named as Richerius (1086). In the Domesday Book, it is stated that the church is \\"held by Richerius thd(sic) Clerk, with two other churches near Southampton, dependent on it as the mother-church, and Richerius owns in right of his benefice all the tithes of the town of Southampton and also of Kingsland\\". The Saxon town survived many invasions and ravages by the Danes but eventually fell into decline and in the time of King Canute in the 11th century the population moved to the safety of the Norman medieval settlement to the west, with St. Michael's Church being first built in 1070. However, St. Mary's continued to be of significant importance as the Mother Church, with its claims to tithes, burial rights and privileges reflecting its status. A document of 1281 appears to confirm the status of St. Mary's as a collegiate church and as the principal church of Southampton. Second church In the 12th century, the church was rebuilt on the instruction of Queen Matilda (the wife of King Henry I), on account of its poor and inadequate state. This, the second church, known as \\"The great church of Our Lady Blessed Mary\\", served for four hundred years and was the principal place of worship despite being outside the walled town. Writing in 1546, the historian John Leland confirmed the 12th century rebuilding of the ancient church of St. Mary. Shortly after Leland's visit to Southampton, the church was destroyed, probably as a punitive measure against the Rector, Dr. William Capon, because of his disagreement with a decision by Government commissioners to confiscate the Chantry lands. The interior of the church, including woodwork and marble tombs, was demolished, the bells removed and the steeple weakened so that it later had to be taken down. The Court Leet of 30 April 1549 ordered that \\"so much of the rubbish of St. Mary's Church should be carted away as would serve to make the highway from Bargate and all East Street down to the turning of the Chantry\\"; all that remained was the chancel. Third church In October 1551, the church, chantry, glebe lands and tithes were all leased out to a merchant and ship-owner, Robert Reniger, at one time Sheriff of Southampton. One condition of the lease, which later passed to the Lambert family, was that the Rector of St. Mary's should receive eighteen pounds a year from the income of the lands. From time to time the Lambert family paid towards the repair of the chancel, where services were still held. However, after the Civil War, during which all the tithes and properties of St. Mary's had been sequestrated and handed over to the Corporation, it is recorded that the \\"chapel\\" or church of St. Mary's was \\"much in decay\\". The town authorised the under-tenant at that time, a Mr. Barber, to get the chapel repaired, and he would be reimbursed from the rent he paid for the lands \\"provided always he does not disburse above shillings\\". Unsurprisingly, the little church continued to be in a sad state. After the Restoration, the leases were returned to the church of St. Mary and by 1662, Doctor Clutterbuck, the Rector, was in possession of the church and its lands. Fourth church In 1711, Archdeacon Brideoak instigated the building of a new church by adding a nave at a cost of £920, but eventually in 1723 the chancel was also rebuilt (for £400). In the eighteenth century, St. Mary's was well outside the built-up area around the walled town to the east, but following the rapid growth and spread of the town around 1800, the church had been much enlarged with aisles and galleries, during the time when Francis North was Rector, who had the church re- consecrated in 1833. In 1850, Philip Brannon wrote in his Picture of Southampton: > It has been recently enlarged by the addition of two wings; and is now in > tolerable repair, but more remarkable for its bold defiance of all > architectural propriety, than for any other characteristic: tall clustered > columns being carried from the floor to support a horizontal beam or > entablature close to the ceiling, whilst plain round windows contrast the > pointed arch of the ancient chancel. By the 1870s, the poor construction of the 1833 church alterations revealed considerable deterioration, and in the 1870s Bishop Samuel Wilberforce sought advice from the eminent architect G. E. Street, who condemned the building. Fifth church On the death of the Bishop in 1873, the subsequent re- building under the Rectorship of his son, Canon Basil Wilberforce, was destined to become his memorial. In August 1878, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) laid the dedication stone, and the new church was consecrated in June 1879 and completed in 1884, with the exception of the tower and spire which were finished in 1912–1914, incorporating eight bells, with two more being added in 1934. During the blitz of 30 November 1940, incendiary bombs destroyed the church leaving a damaged tower, bells and baptistery. At the end of the War, Canon Spencer Leeson and the church council took the decision to restore the bells—\\"thus giving encouragement and visible witness of the determination to rebuild once again\\", with the work being completed by June 1948. The decision to complete the rebuilding of the entire church was not made until the early 1950s. The town was in ruins and this was not deemed to be a priority as worship was being maintained in the nearby Chantry Hall. An offer from the town council to allocate a new site for a town church in East Park Terrace had been turned down in 1946 as the diocese had reservations about the viability of such a large building, and money was being directed towards the construction of new churches in growing outlying areas of the town. Sixth church St Mary's Church, Southampton The rebuilding of the sixth church was finally begun in February 1954 and completed and consecrated in June 1956. The new church was built by Romilly Craze, who retained Street's 200 ft high steeple, the general ground plan and some of the outside walls, made of Purbeck stone (with the interior of Bath stone), with a fine new west window designed by Gerald Smith, depicting six local landmarks. In their 1967 Architectural Guide to Hampshire & The Isle of Wight, Pevsner and Lloyd were rather scathing about the main building and what they saw as a squandered opportunity \\"to build a new mother church worthy of a great city which had played such a significant part in the war in which it had so much suffered\\". They praised Street's tower and spire as making externally \\"a splendid composition, one of the finest Victorian steeples in England ... wonderfully impressive when seen from a medium distance\\". Interior Seafarers chapel window celebrating the port of Southampton The main entrance door is on the west front; on entering the church you can see straight ahead all the way to the chancel and the High Altar, with the Nave Altar and the chancel steps in between. On the left is an archway which leads to the small Baptistery, which is the oldest part of the present church and largely survived the bombing in 1940. It is currently used for small services and for private prayer. The nave is large, with two side aisles, and is also used for art exhibitions. At the head of the nave is the nave altar, backed by the steps into the chancel, containing the choir stalls, with the organ console above them on the left, and most of the pipes on the right. At the far east end is the sanctuary with the high altar enclosed by altar rails. The transepts are level with the nave altar, and the north transept also houses the Seafarers' Chapel, commemorating the seafaring history of the port of Southampton. At the entrance to the chapel are hung the house flags of many of the shipping companies that used the port. A ship's binnacle serves as a lecturn. The chapel window was designed by Gerald E R Smith of London who also designed the great west window and the east window. In May 2018, a memorial window to the crew of the was dedicated by the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Reverend Tim Dakin. The window was designed by Louise Hemmings and features an angel rising from the waves in a cloud of bubbles, one bubble for each member of the crew. Plans drawn up by the architect Columba Cook for a limited internal reordering of St Mary's have recently been approved by the Parochial Church Council. St Mary's reopened in September 2018, rebranded as Saint Mary’s, and becoming part of the Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) family of churches. With extensive work being done on toilets, roofs, floors, staging, lighting, sound and power, along with glass walls for the bell tower. It also now has a kitchen/cafe inside. The church is led by Jon & Hannah Finchhttps://saintmaryschurch.org/about-1. Bells A ring of eight bells was first installed in 1914. Cast at John Taylor's Foundry in Loughborough, they were given by Mary Ann Wingrove in memory of her late husband, Robert, in 1913, and brought to St. Mary's from Southampton Docks railway station in a horse-drawn procession. A further two bells were added in 1934. In 1914, Australian composer A. Emmett Adams and British lyricist Douglas Furber were in Southampton when they heard the recently installed bells ringing across the town, inspiring them to write the song, \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\". The song was later made famous by Bing Crosby in the film of the same name and has since been recorded by many other artistes. Following the destruction of much of the church in November 1940, the damaged bells were taken away for safe-keeping. However, ten new bells were recast from the metal of the originals in 1945, again by Taylor's, and rang again in 1948. Organ The organ in St. Mary's Church, is among the largest church organs in the south of England. The instrument was built by Henry Willis & Sons, and designed in consultation with D. Cecil Williams, organist at the church. It was completed in 1956, and incorporates some \\"Father Willis\\" pipework from the former Albert Hall organ in Stirling. This is a major and impressive instrument in the Willis III tradition. It has remained virtually unaltered since 1956, though the Great, Choir and Pedal organs were overhauled following a roof leak in 1994. The electrics are completely original although at least two stops, the Gedackt and the Cymbel Mixture, are replacement stops, for a Clarabella and a Vox Humana, respectively. Southampton St. Mary's Football Club In 1880, the St. Mary's church football team, founded by the church curate, Rev. Arthur Baron Sole, began playing on the Deanery field, behind the present vicarage. By November 1885, the Deanery club had folded and a new club was founded by members of the St. Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association playing as \\"St. Mary's Young Men's Association F.C.\\"; this became simply \\"St. Mary's F.C.\\" in 1887–88, before adopting the name \\"Southampton St. Mary's F.C.\\" when the club joined the Southern League in 1894. After they won the Southern League title in 1896–97, the club became a limited company and changed their name to \\"Southampton F.C.\\" which has maintained its ecclesiastical connection via its nick-name \\"The Saints\\". From 1887 to 1896, the church was the club's landlord, being the owners of their first permanent home at the Antelope Ground, situated at the northern end of St. Mary's Road.

History Paliyas belonging to war heroes of Mistris of Kutch, the founders of Dhaneti Village, standing near village pond dating back to 1178 AD About the history of Dhaneti, the village holds a special place in annals of Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas or Mistris of Kutch, who entered Kutch and fought a battle on the land of the Dhaneti village in late 12th Century around 1177–78 A.D. (V.S. 1234) and got themselves established and settled at this village under leadership of Patel Ganga Maru.In the 12th (twelfth) century (1178-79) our ancestors made entry into one village named DHANETI in between Anjar and Bhuj of Kutch district.Gurjar Kshatriyas, also known as Mistris, came to Kutch from Rajasthan. They are skilled in building construction. They first established themselves at Dhaneti and were granted 18 villages by the rulers of Kutch.Hemraj Hardasana Solanki a descandant of Solanki dynasty from Saurashtra moved from the Halar region to Dhanety in Kutch with other Kshatriyas. His son Madha Kanji Solanki later founded Madhapar.History: In Vikram Samvant 1234 Gurjar Kshatriyas with leader Patel Ganga Maru came to Dhanetee.Book :Kadia Kshatriya Ithishas : Published by Kumar Praksahan in 1896 in Gujarati Language : Dhaneti was founded (toran bandhyu) in 1179 AD ( Vikram Samvant 1234) by them (Gurjar Kshatriyas a.k.a. Mistris Of Kutch) under leadership of Patel Ganga Maru, when Rao Raydhan Ratto was Ruler of Kachchh.Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Community : A brief History & Glory: by Raja Pawan Jethwa. (2007) Calcutta. Even today, intricate paliyas or memorial stones of their dadas or shurapuras (the ancestors who died while fighting) and deris (pyre alters) of their Satis are standing there near village pond and other areas of village, as a mute witness to the war that was fought on this land by these Gurjar Kshatriyas, who are known as Mistris of Kutch. Today almost a thousand years after the war, the community people visit Dhaneti to pay respect to these memorial stones, built in memory of their forefathers, who gave up their lives fighting to defend their next generations. Later during 14th to 15th century Mistris in course of time left Dhaneti and went on to establish other eighteen villages in Kutch, which were granted to them by the king. They were master craftsmen and architects and have played major role in erection and construction of majority of forts, palaces and architect of Kutch. It was because of their this quality they came to be known as Mistris in Kutch. Present Status At present, majority of people who live in this village are Ahir, Rabari and Goswami. Dhaneti today is famous for special Ahir & Rabari embroidery done by women of this community, and has developed as major centre for this art and tourist attraction. Ramakrishna Mission is running a School, Students Home and other activities in Dhaneti since 1992.

Now squeezed between PA Route 23 and U.S. Route 422 (Pottstown Expressway), it once overlooked the 19th-century industrial village of Port Kennedy. Port Kennedy was named for Alexander Kennedy, a major figure in the American lime industry. Limestone was quarried from the Valley Forge hills and processed into lime, which was shipped on the Schuylkill Canal and, after 1849, on the Reading Railroad. The 1852 mansion and 1845 Port Kennedy Presbyterian Church, now on opposite sides of a highway, a former hotel and train station are all that is left of the village. Summary from the Historic American Buildings Survey: > When John Kennedy built this mansion in 1852, it was the focal point of Port > Kennedy Village.

U.S. Route 422 (Pottstown Expressway) was constructed through the property in the 1960s. Adjacent Valley Forge State Park became Valley Forge National Historical Park in 1976. In 1978, the National Park Service acquired the mansion through eminent domain, and used it to house Park employees. In 1986, Kennedy Supplee Associates LP signed a 55-year lease with the park service, restored the building, and operated it as the Kennedy-Supplee Mansion Restaurant.

Many Austrian descendants in Argentina arrived in the country from other parts of Europe when Austria was a unified kingdom with Hungary. Austrian immigration has been linked to other migratory flows towards the South American country as the German and Swiss immigration waves, among others.  History  Austrian Argentine community of Rosario, Santa Fe during the National Festival of Communities in 2006. Austrian immigrants who came to Argentina did during the two great migratory waves, i.e., about the First and Second World War. The main settlement sites were Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Misiones; in the south, cities like San Carlos de Bariloche and San Martin de los Andes were among the main destinations for Austrians. The amount has never exactly been relieved and there are mostly estimates. In the early thirties, there were approximately 240,000 German- speaking people of whom 45,000 resided in Buenos Aires, and since about 9,000 were of Austrian descent. These figures are similar to those recorded in the Austrian Embassy, approximately 7,000 people of Austrian descent in Buenos Aires, considering the probability of being greater. Since the mid-nineteenth century there had been established a German-speaking colony in the neighbourhood of Belgrano, Buenos Aires. The Austrian and Swiss residents in Buenos Aires were integrated into this colony by the language and cultural affinity in general. This neighbourhood was very attractive to new immigrants since it already had adequate infrastructure, as churches, cafes and bakeries in German families that had arisen due to the former colony. Argentina is, ethnographically, the Latin American country with the largest number of immigrants and descendants of Austrian immigrants (second ranks Brazil and Uruguay in the third) with Córdoba as home to the main Austrian community, which is the province with the largest immigrant population of both German and Austrian descent in the country.  Organisations  Among the Austrian institutions in the country are: the Austrian-Argentine Association (member of the European Club), the San Isidro Austria Club, the Austrian Benevolent Society, the Austrian-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, the House of Austria in Rosario and the Austrian-Argentine Association of Bariloche.  Austrian settlements in Argentina  Villa General Belgrano in Córdoba was a destination for Austrian immigrants along with Germans, Swiss and Italians.

It is the fourth episode from Season 4, and the 69th episode overall. Plot The story starts at Daniel's office, where Betty is helping him pick a new assistant. As Betty collect papers from around the office to use for submitting features, Betty walks by the reception desk where Amanda and Marc are upset that she ignores them. Betty then criticizes Marc about his shirt (too loud), then bumps into Matt, who asks about submitting new features for Mode's upcoming article called \\"New York's Ten Most Thankless Jobs.\\" It appears that Matt and Betty have patched things up. However, as Matt approaches Amanda, she tries to make a move on him, but shrugs her off and Marc reminds her that he dated Betty. When Betty learned from Claire that Daniel hired a sexy assistant named Lexie to take her place, she questioned his judgment about why Daniel hired her, given his past experiences with hiring sexy assistants pre-Betty. Daniel and Lexie seem to not be on the same page as Lexie is more concerned about herself than listening to Daniel. At Wilhelmina's, Nico returned home from getting yogurt, only to get a warning from her mother: She will not leave her side, fearing that she will be found out as a murderer. At work, Wilhelmina also learned from Marc that Cal and Claire are having dinner and the rumor that she might be replaced by Isabella, who works for \\"Vogue France.\\" As Betty walked in to ask Wili about looking for an assistant to help her, she ended up turning to Marc. This gives Wilhelmina the time needed to keep a closer eye on her daughter, whom she uses as her assistant. The two are not happy about this, even as Marc complains about working under her while Wilhelmina tells Betty she needs to deliver a feature. They continue to bicker until Marc challenges Betty to confront Daniel about why she got the job. That's when Daniel and Wilhelmina came clean about the coin toss. Although Daniel admitted that he thought Betty the right person for the job, Betty would get teased by Marc over the coin toss, and when they get their assignment from Matt, he tells Betty that she would be the one doing the jobs, which Marc agrees. However, Marc is standing by while Betty takes the dirty jobs. When they arrive at a hot dog stand, the vendor asks the two to dress up, in which Betty is chosen as the hot dog, but Marc is picked as the bun and feels humiliated about it. This pairing is not working out and as Marc confesses about being Wilhelmina's assistant for five years and that he was better qualified as a features editor than Betty. When Marc tells her about his dream about working for Vogue only to turn it down for Mode, they run into his idol, who recognizes Marc. When he asks Marc about how life's been treating him at Mode and if he got promoted, Marc tries to be honest but Betty saves him and Marc gets an invitation to join him for a get-together. As Marc thanked Betty for saving him, Betty gets a call that there will be an emergency meeting in seven minutes. But thanks to Marc throwing away her clothes while they were in costume, Betty blames Marc for trying to ridicule her and make her look like a joke and as a cab came by, Betty in costume got in and told Marc not to come along. Marc felt embarrassed at what he did. During lunch, Wilhelmina and Nico run into Cal and Claire, who pitch the idea about doing a cover about vampires, but Wilhelmina thinks to herself that it's a joke. During the shoot, Wilhelmina makes her feelings known to Nico about this issue and Claire hears this. She agrees and tells Wilhelmina that it was Cal's idea, then tells her to cut ten pages from the upcoming issue. Claire's message to Wilhelmina: \\"Just do your job...while you still have one.\\" Also at lunch, Natalie pitches an idea to Daniel about joining a group called \\"The Community Of The Phoenix,\\" this after being accused by Natalie for scoffing. Later that day, Daniel gets a lesson about Hiring 101 from Betty about who hired her (Bradford) and she explained the reason why she was hired in the first place, Lexie hears this and is not happy. Daniel tries to convince Lexie that he wasn't trying to seduce her, but when he touched her breast by mistake Lexie accused Daniel of harassment. Claire is not happy about what Daniel did even as he tried to assure his mother that he was just trying to explain to Lexie that he only hired her, not to bed her. Later at the center, Daniel and Natalie listen to a speech by its leader, Bennett, who tells the audience about being honest after losing a loved one, even as Daniel scoffs at the speaker. Bennett looks at Daniel and gives him advice about using honesty as way to be open. Hours later at Mode, Daniel, upset about Lexie treating him like dirt, made his feelings known about why he hired her in the first place, then tells her that she was not cut out to be an assistant and he was not a womanizer anymore. However, Daniel, using that honesty advice he got from Bennett, did tell her that she might have a future as a model, which Lexie took to heart and believed that was, indeed, her future. At the reception desk, Amanda sees Matt and tries to kiss him, but freaks out when she kisses Betty in her hot dog costume. It turns out Amanda was daydreaming and she is still freaking out when she sees Betty in the costume for real and freaking out at Matt as well. At the meeting, Matt convinces Betty to tell Wilhelmina not to cut ten pages from the upcoming issue. So Betty pitched her story and with help from Marc (still dressed as a bun), who performed their pitch from the hot dog stand and suggested a model would be right for the feature, Wilhelmina approves it, giving Betty her first feature for Mode, with Lexie being featured for the article. Betty thanked Daniel for believing in her as a features editor and Daniel in turn thanked Betty for being honest. Hours later at a coffee shop, Betty showed Marc the article and pointed to the credit that featured his name as the contributor. She then hugged Marc. Later that day, Wilhelmina learned that Isabella got another offer and turned down the job to replace her. When she ran this by Nico because she didn't bribe anyone at French Mode, Nico revealed to her mother about making a phone call (in French), thus saving Wilhelmina's job. Seeing how useful her daughter is, Wilhelmina tells Nico that they might be able to trust each other. But over at the marina, the blood stain the two missed while they cleaned the yacht a while back is finally discovered. At the Suarez home, where Justin helps Ignacio with surfing the web for the first time, Hilda is starting to worry about why Archie has not come by to see her. At work Betty gets a call from Hilda about sending Archie a sexy picture by asking her about where Betty put the boots. Later on, Hilda gets a shock from Archie when she learned that she accidentally hit \\"Reply to All\\" and sent the picture (featuring her exposed breasts) to everyone in Archie's district. This made Archie furious at Hilda, as he feared this could damage his campaign. However, Archie stops by later to show Hilda a press conference he held as damage control by telling the public he still loves Hilda, despite whatever people think of what she did. All is forgiven as Archie tells Hilda the picture helped his campaign, and the two celebrate with a little lovemaking upstairs.

Most pre-historic and medieval wooden dwellings worldwide were built post in ground. History This type of construction is often believed to be an intermediate form between a palisade construction and a stave construction. Because the postholes are easily detected in archaeological surveys, they can be distinguished from the other two. Post in ground was one of the timber construction methods used for French colonial structures in New France; it was called poteaux-en-terre.

This method is very similar to poteaux-sur-sol but the boulin (hewn posts) are planted in the ground rather than landing on a sill plate. The spaces between the boulin were filled with bousillage (reinforced mud) or pierrotage (stones and mud). Surviving examples of both types of structures can be found at Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.

It lies to the west of Kondapalli in the Krishna District, Vijayawada. Geography The fort is located to the west of Vijayawada city in the main hill range known as Kondapalli in the Krishna district. The hill range, about in length, extends between Nandigama and Vijayawada. The forest area in this hill range abounds in a type of lightwood known as 'ponuku' పొనుకు కఱ్ఱ (Gyrocapus jacquini), which is used exclusively for the manufacture of the famous Kondpalli toys. The forest vegetation around Kondapalli fort and the nearby hills are also well known for medicinal plants and trees such as Phyllanthus amarus (Telugu local name \\"nela usiri\\" నేల ఉసిరిక చెట్టు), Phyllanthus, Andrographis paniculata (local name: \\"adavi mirapa\\" అడవి మిరప or \\"nelavemu\\" నేలవేము), Thedlapala (Wrightia tinctoria), Tephrosia purpurea, Albizia amara, Streulia urens and Chloroxylon swetenia. The hill range is mainly made up of charnockites, with some pyroxene granulites, granites, khondalites, pyroxenites and dolerites. History The fort was built in 1360 CE by Anna Vemareddy of the Kondaveedu Reddy dynasty after he captured Kondapalli from Mudigonda Chalakyas.Mudigonda Chalakyulu, the fort has been home to several dynasties The News Minute. In the historic struggle for power for the throne of Gajapati kingdom, Hamvira had to fight his brother Purushottam, who had succeeded to the throne after their father's death. He sought the help of the Bahmani Sultan in this war. He was successful in defeating his brother and occupied the throne of Gajapati kingdom, in 1472. But in the bargain, he gave Kondapalli and Rajahmundry to the Bahmani Sultan. Subsequently, Purushottam defeated Hamvira in 1476 and occupied the throne of Gajapati. But it is also said that in 1476, a revolution began at Kondapalli when there was famine in the Bahmani kingdom. The garrison of Kondapalli revolted and gave possession of the fort to \\"Hamer Oriya\\" or Hamvira. Purushottam, once he became the king, tried to get back Kondapalli and Rajahmundry from the Bahmani Sultan III. But when he held siege over Rajamundry, for some unknown reason he signed a peace treaty with the Sultan, which resulted in souring of relations between Bahmani and Vijayanagar rulers, which resulted in minor battles. But in 1481, after the death of Sultan Mahammad, the Bahmani Sultanate was in disarray and taking advantage of this situation Purushottam fought with Mahmad Shah, the Sultan’s son, and took control of Rajahmundry and Kondapalli fort. Gajapati Purushottam Deva died in 1497 and was succeeded by his son Gajapati Prataprudra Deva. In 1509, Gajapati Prataprudra Deva started a war against Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar Empire, but Gajapati had to retreat to the north to defend an attack by Sultan Allauddin Hussan Shah of Bengal. The consequence was that Krishnadevaraya had an easy victory over Kondapalli, which he occupied in June 1515. In the last war fought in 1519, Krishnadevaraya once again defeated the Gajapati ruler. Since the Kondaveedu fortress was very strong, after three months siege of the fort, Krishnadevaraya had to personally direct the operations to get control of the fort. Following this war, Krishnadevaraya married Gajapati Prataprudra Deva’s daughter, Kalinga Kumari Jaganmohini. A treaty was also signed for restoring all land up to the southern boundary of the Krishna River to Orissa, which included Kondapalli. But after the treaty with Vijayanagara emperor, between 1519 and 1525, Gajapati Prataprudra Deva had to defend his territory against invasion by Sultan Quli Qutab, the Sultan of Golkonda. But in the final assault, in 1531, Kondapalli came under the rule of Sultan of Golkonda. The war with Golkonda Sultans was continued by Govinda Bidyadhar, the new ruler of the Gajapati Kingdom who had succeeded Gajapati Prataprudra Deva (who died in 1533) but ended finally with a treaty with the Sultan. The area came under Mughal rule in the 17th century. After the disintegration of the Mughal Empire in early 18th century, Nizam ul-Mulk, what later became the Nizam of Hyderabad declared independence and took the area under its control. In the late 18th century, the area was still under the Nizam’s rule, a treaty of alliance was signed between Nizam Ali and the British East India Company recognizing the control of the British over the territory. This treaty was initially signed on 12 November 1766 under which the company in return for the grant of the territory agreed to garrison troops in the fort for Nizam’s aid at an annual cost of 90,000 pounds. It is also stated that in 1766 the British, under General Caillaud, stormed the fort and took control of it. A second treaty was signed on 1 March 1768, under which the Nizam recognized the grant provided to the British by Mughal ruler Shah Alam. But, as a gesture of friendship, the British (then the East India Company) agreed to pay an allowance of 50,000 pounds to the Nizam. However, in 1823, the East India Company rested total control of the Sarcars under an outright purchase from the Nizam. In the initial years, the fort was used as a business center but after the British took over the fort in 1766 it was converted into a military training base. Structure Royal prison at Kondapalli Fort Aerial view of Kondapalli Fort The fort, which has a very picturesque sight, has three successive entry gates. The main entrance gate is called the ‘Dargha Darwaja’ built with single block of granite. It is wide and high. Its name is derived from the tomb or dargha of Gulab Shah, who was killed in battle here. Besides Darhgha Darwaza, another entrance gate called the Golconda Darwaza is located on the other end of the hill, which leads to Jaggaiahpet village. The fortified wall has towers and battlements. At the far end of the fort there is the Tanisha Mahal or Palace, perched on a crest between two hills. The palace had many chambers on the ground floor and a huge hall on the upper floor. In addition, there are several buildings still standing in the fort, which are ruins. There is deep reservoir near the palace, which is sourced by a spring. The water in the reservoir is said to be very cold and to cause fever. There are numerous other water tanks in the fort area, which go dry during the summer months. An old granary now in ruins, beyond the reservoir, is inhabited by bats. An English barrack is still standing in the fort area, which has eight large rooms, apart from a house in an annex. An English cemetery is also seen in the fort. Restoration works The Archeological Department of Andhra Pradesh has undertaken restoration and renovation works of the fort and the structures located within its precincts. The works cover improving link road to the fort from the National Highway, strengthening and restoring of historical walls, restoration of Jail Khana (prison house), Koneru pond and Museum, building a ropeway up to the hill, construction of inner roads, providing basic amenities such as three-phase power supply, drinking water and toilets, landscaping and setting up food courts.The museum located there contains relics found at that place along with display of Kondapalli Toys and lot of Historical references.

Popov was born into a wealthy family and was a practicing lawyer at the start of the war. He held a great aversion to Nazism, and in 1940, infiltrated the Abwehr, Germany's military intelligence service, which considered him a valuable asset due to his business connections in France and the United Kingdom. Popov provided the Germans with misleading and inaccurate information for much of the war. Deceptions in which he participated included Operation Fortitude, which sought to convince German military planners that the Allied invasion of Europe would take place in Calais, not Normandy, thereby diverting hundreds of thousands of German troops and increasing the likelihood that Operation Overlord would succeed. Popov was known for his promiscuous lifestyle and courted women during his missions, including the French actress Simone Simon. Apart from MI6 and the Abwehr, he also reported to the Yugoslav intelligence service, which assigned him the codename Duško. His German handlers referred to him by the codename Ivan. He was codenamed Tricycle by the British MI5 because he was the head of a group of three double agents. In 1974, he published an autobiography titled Spy/Counterspy, in which he recounted his wartime exploits. Popov is considered one of Ian Fleming's primary inspirations for the character of James Bond. He has been the subject of a number of non-fiction books and documentaries. Early life Dušan \\"Duško\\" Popov was born to a Serb family in Titel, Austria-Hungary on 10 July 1912. His parents were Milorad and Zora Popov. He had an older brother named Ivan (\\"Ivo\\") and a younger brother named Vladan. The family was exceedingly wealthy and owed its fortune to Popov's paternal grandfather, Omer, a wealthy banker and industrialist who founded a number of factories, mines, and retail businesses. They hailed from the village of Karlovo (now Novo Miloševo). Records from as early as 1773 describe them as the most affluent family there. Popov's father expanded the family's business interests to include real estate dealings. When Popov was an infant, the family left Titel and permanently relocated to their summer residence in Dubrovnik, which was their home for much of the year. They also had a manor in Belgrade, where they spent the winter months. Popov's childhood coincided with a series of monumental political changes in the Balkans. In November 1918, Austria-Hungary disintegrated into a number of smaller states, and its Balkan possessions were incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). The newly established, Serb-led state was plagued by political infighting among its various constitutive ethnic groups, particularly Serbs and Croats, but also Hungarians and Germans. The young Popov and his family enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle and were far removed from the political turmoil in the country. They boasted a sizeable collection of villas and yachts, and were attended by servants, even on their travels. Duško and his brothers spent most of their formative years along the Adriatic coast, and were avid athletes and outdoorsmen. Popov's father indulged his sons, building a spacious villa by the sea for their exclusive use where they could entertain their friends and host expensive parties. He was also insistent that they receive a quality education. Apart from his native Serbian, Popov was fluent in Italian, German and French by his teenage years. Between the ages of 12 and 16, he attended a lycée in Paris. In 1929, Popov's father enrolled him into Ewell Castle, a prestigious preparatory school in Surrey. Popov's stint at the school proved to be short lived. After only four months, he was expelled following an altercation with a teacher. He had previously endured a caning at the teacher's hands after being caught smoking a cigarette. Another caning was adjudicated after Popov missed a detention, and so as to evade further corporal punishment, Popov grabbed the teacher's cane and snapped it in two before his classmates. Popov's father subsequently enrolled him at Lycée Hoche, a secondary institution in Versailles, which he attended for the following two years. Student activism At the age of 18, Popov enrolled in the University of Belgrade, seeking an undergraduate degree in law. Over the next four years, he became a familiar face in Belgrade's cafes and nightclubs, and had the reputation of a ladies' man. \\"Women ... found him irresistible,\\" Times columnist Ben Macintyre writes, \\"with his easy manner, loose, sensual mouth ... and green ... bedroom eyes.\\" In 1934, Popov enrolled in the University of Freiburg, intent on securing a doctorate in law. Germany had only recently come under the rule of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, but at the time, Popov paid little regard to politics. He had chosen Freiburg because it was relatively close to his native country and he was eager to improve his German-language skills. Germany was already the site of mass book burnings, the first concentration camps had been established and the systematic persecution of Jews had commenced. Popov began his studies at the University of Freiburg in the autumn of 1935, and in subsequent months, began showing greater interest in politics and voiced his political opinions more vigorously. Around the same time, he befriended a fellow student, Johnny Jebsen, the son of a German shipping magnate. The two grew close, largely due to their raucous lifestyle and a shared interest in sports vehicles. In 1936–37, Popov began participating in debates at the Ausländer Club, which were held every other Friday evening. He was disappointed that many foreign students appeared to be swayed by the pro-Nazi arguments espoused there. Popov discovered that the German debaters were all hand-picked party members who chose the subject of each debate beforehand and vigorously rehearsed Nazi talking points. He persuaded Jebsen, then the president of the club, to inform him of the debate topics in advance and passed this information along to the British and American debaters. Popov himself delivered two speeches at the club, arguing in favour of democracy. He also wrote several articles for the Belgrade daily Politika, ridiculing the Nazis. \\"Duško despised Nazism,\\" biographer Larry Loftis writes, \\"and since he wasn't German, he believed he owed no allegiance to Hitler or the state.\\" In the summer of 1937, Popov completed his doctoral thesis, and decided to celebrate by embarking on a trip to Paris. Before he could leave, he was arrested by the Gestapo, who accused him of being a communist. His movements had been tracked by undercover agents beforehand and his acquaintances questioned. Popov was incarcerated at the Freiburg prison without formal proceedings. When Jebsen received news of his friend's arrest, he called Popov's father and informed him of what had occurred. Popov's father contacted Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović, who raised the issue with Hermann Göring, and after eight days in captivity, Popov was released. He was ordered to leave Germany within 24 hours, and upon collecting his belongings, boarded a train for Switzerland. He soon arrived in Basel and found Jebsen waiting for him on the station platform. Jebsen informed Popov of the role he played in securing his release. Popov expressed gratitude and told Jebsen that if he was ever in need of any assistance he needed only ask. World War II Initiation Popov's passport photo, 1941 Upon his return to Dubrovnik in the fall of 1937, Popov began practicing law. In February 1940, he received a message from Jebsen, asking to meet him at the Hotel Serbian King in Belgrade. Popov was shocked to find Jebsen a nervous wreck, chain smoking and drinking exorbitantly. He told Popov that he had joined his family's shipping business after graduating from Freiburg and explained that he needed a Yugoslav shipping license to evade the Allied naval blockade at Trieste. Popov agreed to help Jebsen, and the latter travelled back to Berlin to collect the required documentation. Two weeks later, Jebsen returned to Belgrade, and informed Popov that he had joined the Abwehr, German's military intelligence service, as a Forscher (researcher). Jebsen's ability to travel across Europe on business trips would remain unimpeded so long as he submitted reports detailing the information he had received from his business contacts. He told Popov he joined the Abwehr to avoid being conscripted into the Wehrmacht. Jebsen said military service was not an option because he suffered from varicose veins. The news came as a surprise to Popov, as his friend had previously expressed anti-Nazi views. Popov informed Clement Hope, a passport control officer at the British legation in Yugoslavia. Hope enrolled Popov as a double agent with the codename Scoot (he was later known to his handler as Tricycle), and advised him to cooperate with Jebsen.Nigel West, 'Popov, Dusan (1912–1981)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 Once accepted as a double agent, Popov moved to London. His international business activities in an import-export business provided cover for visits to neutral Portugal; its capital, Lisbon, was linked to the UK by a weekly civilian air service for most of the war. Popov used his cover position to report periodically to his Abwehr handlers in Portugal. Popov fed enough MI6-approved information to the Germans to keep them happy and unaware of his actions, and was well-paid for his services. The assignments given to him were of great value to the British in assessing enemy plans and thinking. His most important deception was convincing the Germans that the D-Day landings would be in Calais, not Normandy, and was able to report back to MI6 that they fell for this deception, which corroborated Bletchley Park's decryption of Lorenz cipher machine messages. Popov was famous for his playboy lifestyle, while carrying out perilous wartime missions for the British. Allegations regarding Pearl Harbor In 1941, Popov repeatedly travelled to Portugal during his missions. He stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Palácio, in January and March 1941, then again between 29 June and 10 August 1941.Exiles Memorial Center. During his stay, he met Ian Fleming, at the time working for the British Royal Navy. They both shared a mission at Casino Estoril, and it’s believed that Popov served as inspiration for the character of James Bond in Fleming’s novels.See \\"Dusko Popov Biography\\" held at Exiles Memorial Center. After this last stay, he was dispatched to the United States by the Abwehr to establish a new German network.nationalarchives.gov.uk – Dusko Popov – Record Summary He was given ample funds and an intelligence questionnaire (a list of intelligence targets, later published as an appendix to J.C. Masterman's book The Double Cross System). Of the three typewritten pages of the questionnaire, one entire page was devoted to highly detailed questions about US defences at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. He made contact with the FBI and explained what he had been asked to do. During a televised interview, Duško Popov related having informed the FBI on 12 August 1941 of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor. Either the FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover did not report this fact to his superiorsJeffreys-Jones, Rhodri (2007). FBI: A History, p.110. Yale University Press. . or they, for reasons of their own, took no action. Hoover distrusted Popov because he was a double agent although MI6 had told the FBI in New York City that he would be arriving. Popov himself said Hoover was quite suspicious and distrustful of him and, according to author William \\"Mole\\" Wood, when Hoover discovered Popov had brought a woman from New York State to Florida, threatened to have him arrested under the Mann Act if he did not leave the US immediately. Operation Fortitude In 1944, Popov became a key part of the deception operation codenamed Fortitude. At the time of the operation, he was staying in Portugal. He stayed in Estoril once again, at the Hotel Palácio, between 31 March and 12 April 1944. When Jebsen was arrested by the Gestapo in Lisbon, the British feared Popov had been compromised and ceased giving him critical information to pass along to the Germans. It was later discovered that the Abwehr still regarded Popov as an asset and he was brought back into use by the British. Jebsen's death at the hands of the Nazis had a profound emotional impact on Popov. Later life In 1972, John Cecil Masterman published The Double Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945, an intimate account of wartime British military deception. Before its publication, Popov had no intention of revealing his wartime activities, believing that the MI6 would not allow it. Masterman's book convinced Popov that it was time to make his exploits public. In 1974, Popov published an autobiography titled Spy/Counterspy, \\"a racy account of his adventures that read like a James Bond novel.\\" Miller describes it as \\"fundamentally accurate, if occasionally embellished\\". Several of the events described in the book were either entirely fictional, such as a fistfight Popov claimed to have had with a German agent, exaggerated for dramatic effect, or could not be substantiated through subsequently declassified intelligence records. Popov's wife and children were apparently unaware of his past until the book's publication. By the early 1980s, years of chain smoking and heavy drinking had taken a toll on Popov's health. He died in Opio on 10 August 1981, aged 69. His family said his death came after a long illness. He was predeceased by his brother Ivo, who died in 1980. Shortly after Popov's death, MI6 began declassifying documents that pertained to Allied intelligence-gathering and disinformation activities during the war, thereby verifying many of his claims. Popov was the subject of a one-hour television documentary produced by Starz Inc. and Cinenova, titled True Bond, which aired in June 2007. Two other documentaries recounting Popov's exploits, The Real Life James Bond: Dusko Popov and Double Agent Dusko Popov: Inspiration for James Bond, have also been produced. Popov has also been the subject of several biographies, notably Miller's Codename Tricycle (2004) and Loftis' Into the Lion's Mouth (2016).

The aircraft returned to the airport and repaired, and the same plane was used to continue the flight. At 3:50 pm GMT, the plane landed in East London in poor weather. On departure from East London, the plane suffered a bird strike and was inspected upon landing at Port Elizabeth where it was determined to still be airworthy. From Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg, the plane was marketed as Flight 406. Knowing he might need to bypass a landing in East London due to poor weather, Captain Lipawsky took on more fuel than would usually be loaded for the flight between Port Elizabeth and East London. He also told the passengers scheduled to disembark at East London aware that they may need to overfly the airport. One passenger stayed in Port Elizabeth to wait for a better chance to land, while the other passenger decided to continue with the flight, and stay overnight in Johannesburg if needed. At 4:41 pm GMT, Flight 406 took off from Port Elizabeth, and a 4:58 GMT, a weather report for East London was given. Acknowledgement of receipt of the weather report was given a minute later, and the pilot further requested descent clearance from flight level 90 (about 9,000 feet), which was granted. Air traffic control at East London requested the pilot to radio when he passed 4,500 ft. The pilot was recorded at Port Elizabeth tower saying that he was descending through 4,000 ft, seaward of the coastline and about 20 miles away from landing at 5:06 pm GMT. The pilot was made aware that lights for both runways were on, but runway 10 was not available due to poor visibility. At 5:09 pm GMT (estimated), the pilot radioed to say he was at 2,000 ft and had the coast in sight. After this transmission, the plane was not heard from again. Investigation The rescue attempt and later investigation were complicated by the plane crashing into the sea at night. The investigators were unable to recover the plane or the bodies of the passengers. The official investigation believed the plane was airworthy at the time it hit the water. Since the aircraft was airworthy, the investigation concluded the accident had two possible causes. The most likely cause was the pilot having a heart attack and the co-pilot being unable to recover the plane before it crashed. The original report admitted the accident could have occurred due to spatial disorientation of the pilot, but believed that this was unlikely due to the pilot's experience level. Judge Cecil Margo, one of the original investigators, later stated in his memoir, Final Postponement, that he believed the plane crashed due to separation of the wing. At the time of the crash, Margo said that four Vickers Viscounts had been lost in crashes, two due to structural failure, and two over water with unknown cause. Margo continues saying that just after this crash, another Vickers Viscount was lost over the sea on its way to Ireland, and yet another was lost over land in Australia. The crash in Australia allowed investigators to find the cause of in-flight disintegration, a failed wing spar. Later on, Margo connected the dots with the other crashes at sea, and as of writing his memoirs, he believed that the Rietbok crash was due to a failed wing spar as well. Subsequently, both Australian Viscount crashes were found to be due to maintenance errors. Controversy The crash of Rietbok happened during the Apartheid era in South Africa. In 1967, the Government of South Africa was increasingly aggressive in its actions against those who opposed the Apartheid government, as they had just banned the African National Congress (ANC) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). Two people who were known to criticize the Apartheid government were on the flight, Johannes Bruwer and Audrey Rosenthal. Bruwer was the acting chair of the powerful Afrikaner Broederbond, and was said to be deeply disillusioned with apartheid. Rosenthal was an American working with the Defense and Aid Fund, a group that helped jailed and exiled PAC and ANC member's families. Both people told family members or friends that they believed the security branch was investigating or following them. In 1998, Malcolm Viviers, a navy diver came forward with the story that the government had been successful in finding the wreck soon after the crash. He claimed to have seen passengers strapped into their seats in the plane via a video monitor on the SAS Johannesburg. Due to this new evidence, family members of the victims have petitioned the Minister of Transport to reopen the air incident investigation.

Personal life Gabriel Scott Jensen was born in Leith in Scotland as the son of sailors' priest Svend Holst Jensen and his wife writer and composer Caroline Mathilde Schytte. The name Scott was originally a first name, and he was named after both Scotland and the writer Walter Scott. He moved to Norway when he was seven years old, his father being a parish priest in Høvåg. In 1901, Scott married Ellen Johansen (1871–1914), but this marriage was dissolved in 1912. In 1915, he married secondly Dagmar Marie Jensen, but in 1918 this marriage also ended in divorce. Finally, in 1918, he married Birgit Gabrielsen (1897–1981). He died in Arendal in 1958. Career Scott made his literary debut in 1894 with the poetry collection Digte ('Poems'), and followed up with a second collection, Dag ('Day') in 1895. In 1896 he published the love story Aftenrøde. Arkitekt Helmers optegnelser, and the story collection Vester i Skjærene. His 1904 novel Tante Pose ('Aunt Bag') was the basis of the film Tante Pose, 1940. In 1905, he wrote the comedy Himmeluret. His literary breakthrough was the novel Jernbyrden (1915), which was well received by the critics. His most famous book is the novel Kilden eller Brevet om fiskeren Markus ('The Source, or the Letter about Mark the Fisherman'), 1918, a story about the fisherman Mark living a simple life and presenting simple thoughts. In his book Det gyldne Evangelium ('The Golden Gospel'), 1921, the main characters are Saint Peter and Our Lord, who are seen wandering and meeting people. His books on the Norwegian travelling people, Fant (1928) and Josefa (1930) became popular, and in 1937 Fant was made into a film by Tancred Ibsen. The novel De vergeløse ('The Defenseless'), about a child taken from its mother by the authorities, was made into a film by Leif Sinding in 1939. Scott wrote several books for children, including Sølvfaks som reiste ut i den vide verden ('Sølvfaks Who Went out into the Wide World'), 1912, which has since gone into many editions, and Hellige tre konger ('We Three Kings'), 1900. Scott was awarded the Gyldendal's Endowment in 1936. During the 1930s, he was fundamentally pro- German, publishing articles praising both Vidkun Quisling's National Gathering and Hitler's Germany. This stance was much debated, before, during and after the Second World War. However, before the beginning of the war he had begun to distance himself from the German dictatorship, and during the war he wrote patriotic poetry. Scott and Vilhelm Krag are now considered southern Norway's most important poets.

A cable includes a conductor and insulation. Cables are considered to be fully insulated. This means that they have a full rated insulation system which will consist of insulation, semi-con layers, and a metallic shield. This is in contrast to an overhead line, which may include insulation but not fully rated for operating voltage (EG: tree wire). High- voltage cables of differing types have a variety of applications in instruments, ignition systems, and alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power transmission. In all applications, the insulation of the cable must not deteriorate due to the high-voltage stress, ozone produced by electric discharges in air, or tracking. The cable system must prevent contact of the high-voltage conductor with other objects or persons, and must contain and control leakage current. Cable joints and terminals must be designed to control the high-voltage stress to prevent breakdown of the insulation. The cut lengths of high-voltage cables may vary from several feet to thousands of feet, with relatively short cables used in apparatus and longer cables run within buildings or as buried cables in an industrial plant or for power distribution. The longest cut lengths of cable will often be submarine cables under the ocean for power transmission. Figure 2: A cross-section through a 400 kV cable, showing the stranded segmented copper conductor in the center, semiconducting and insulating layers, copper shield conductors, alt= Cable Insulation Technologies Like other power cables, high-voltage cables have the structural elements of one or more conductors, an insulation system, and a protective jacket. High-voltage cables differ from lower-voltage cables in that they have additional internal layers in the insulation system to control the electric field around the conductor. These additional layers are required at 2,000 volts between conductors. Without these semi-conducting layers the cable will fail due to electrical stress within minutes. This technique was patented by Martin Hochstadter in 1916; the shield is sometimes called a Hochstadter shield, and shielded cable used to be called H-Type Cable. Depending on the grounding scheme, the shields of a cable can be connected to ground at one end or both ends of the cable. Splices in the middle of the cable can be also grounded depending on the length of the circuit and if a semiconducting jacket is employed on direct buried circuits.. Figure 3, Cross section of typical 15KV #2 copper medium voltage EPR cable. Suitable for URD installation, direct buried or in duct. All layers of the cable construction are marked and identified. Since 1960 solid dielectric extruded cables have taken dominance in the distribution market. These medium voltage cables are generally insulated with EPR or XLPE polymeric insulation. EPR insulation is common on cables from 4-34kV. EPR is not commonly used over 35KV due to losses however it can be found in 69kV cables. XLPE is used at all voltage levels from the 600V class and up. Sometimes EAM insulation is marketed, however, market penetration remains fairly low. Solid, extruded insulation cables such as EPR and XLPE account for the majority of distribution and transmission cables produced today. However the relative unreliability early XLPE resulted in a slow adoption at transmission voltages. Cables of 330, 400, and 500 kV are commonly constructed using XLPE today, but this has occurred only in recent decades. Figure 4: Typical 15KV insulation class 3-conductor (3/C) paper insulated lead covered (PILC) cable. 1990s vintage. An increasingly uncommon insulation type is PILC or paper insulation lead covered cable. Some utilities still install this for distribution circuits as new construction or replacement. Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti was the first to demonstrate in 1887 that carefully dried and prepared kraft paper could form satisfactory cable insulation at 11,000 volts. Previously paper-insulated cable had only been applied for low-voltage telegraph and telephone circuits. An extruded lead sheath over the paper cable was required to ensure that the paper remained moisture free. Mass-impregnated paper-insulated medium voltage cables were commercially practical by 1895. During World War II several varieties of synthetic rubber and polyethylene insulation were applied to cables. Modern high-voltage cables use polymers or polyethylene, including cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) for insulation. The demise of PILC could be considered to be in the 1980s and 1990s as urban utilities started to install more EPR and XLPE insulated cables. The factors for the decreased use of PILC are the high level of craftsmanship needed to splice lead, longer splicing times, reduced availability of the product domestically, and pressure to stop using lead for environmental and safety reasons. It should also be noted that rubber insulated lead covered cable enjoyed a short period of popularity prior to 1960 in the low and medium voltage markets but was not widely used by most utilities. Existing PILC feeders are often considered to be near end of life by most utilities and subject to replacement programs. Vulcanized rubber was patented by Charles Goodyear in 1844, but it was not applied to cable insulation until the 1880s, when it was used for lighting circuits. Rubber- insulated cable was used for 11,000 volt circuits in 1897 installed for the Niagara Falls Power Generation project. Figure 5: 69KV Medium Pressure Oil Filled Cable. This cable features concentric copper conductors insulated in kraft paper. Shield on the individual phases is provided with interlaced carbon and zinc tapes. Overall shield is also provided. Tubes facilitate oil movement provided by a series of pumping plants. 150 mils of lead provide protection from moisture. Oil filled, gas filled, and pipe type cables have been largely considered obsolete since the 1960s. Such cables are designed to have significant oil flow through the cable. Standard PILC cables are impregnated with oil but the oil is not designed to flow or cool the cable. Oil filled cables are typically lead insulated and can be purchased on reels. Pipe type cables differ from oil filled cables in that they are installed in a rigid pipe usually made of steel. With pipe type cables the pipes are constructed first and then at a later date the cable is pulled through. The cable may feature skid wires to prevent damage during the pulling process. The cross-sectional volume of oil in a pipe type cable is significantly higher than in an oil filled cable. These pipe type cables are oil filled at nominal low, medium, and high pressures. Higher voltages require higher oil pressures to prevent formation of voids that would allow partial discharges within the cable insulation. Pipe type cables will typically have a cathodic protection system driven off voltage where an oil filled cable circuit would not. Pipe type cable systems are often protected from forming holidays through an asphaltic coating. There are still many of these pipe type circuits in operation today. However, they have fallen out of favor due to the high front end cost and massive O+M budget needed to maintain the fleet of pumping plants. Cable Insulation Components High voltage is defined as any voltage over 1000 volts.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, pp. 133-137 Those of 2 to 33 kV are usually called medium voltage cables, those over 50 kV high voltage cables. Modern HV cables have a simple design consisting of few parts: the conductor, the conductor shield, the insulation, the insulation shield, the metallic shield, and the jacket. Other layers can include water blocking tapes, rip cords, and armor wires. Copper or aluminium wires transports the current, see (1) in figure 1. (For a detailed discussion on copper cables, see main article: Copper conductor.) The insulation, insulation shield, and conductor shield, are generally polymer based with a few rare exceptions. Single conductor designs under 2000KCM are generally concentric. The individual strands are often deformed during the stranding process to provide a smoother overall circumference. These are known are compact and compressed conductors. Compact offers a 10% reduction in conductor outer diameter while the compressed version only offers a 3% decrease. The selection of a compressed or compact conductor will often require a different connector during splicing. 2000KCM and larger transmission cables often include a sectored style design to reduce skin effect losses. Utility power cables are often designed to run at up to 75C, 90C, and 105C conductor temperature. This temperature is limited by the construction standard and jacket selection. The conductor shield is always permanently bonded to the EPR or XLPE cable insulation in solid dielectric cable. The semi conductive insulation shield can be bonded or removable depending on the desires of the purchaser. For voltages 69KV and up the insulation shield is generally bonded. Strippable insulation shield is purchased to reduce splicing time and skill. It can be argued that strippable semicon can lead to fewer workmanship issues at medium voltage.Kuffel 2000 and Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2, p. 118 With paper insulated cables the semiconducting layers consist of carbon bearing or metalized tapes applied over the conductor and paper insulation. The function of these layers is to prevent air-filled cavities and suppress voltage stress between the metal conductors and the dielectric so that little electric discharges cannot arise and endanger the insulation material.Kuffel 2000, sec. Discharges The insulation shield is covered by a copper, aluminum, or lead \\"screen.\\" The metallic shield or sheath serves as an earthed layer and will drain leakage currents. The shield's function is not to conduct faults but that functionality can be designed in if desired. Some designs that could be used are copper tape, concentric copper wires, longitudinally corrugated shield, copper flat straps, or extruded lead sheath. The cable jacket is often polymeric. The function of the jacket is to provide mechanical production as well as prevent moisture & chemical intrusion. Jackets can be semiconducting or non-conducting depending on soil conditions and desired grounding configuration. Semiconducting jackets can also be employed on cables to help with a jacket integrity test. Some types of jackets are: LLDPE, HDPE, polypropylene, PVC (bottom end of the market), LSZH, etc. Figure 6: An example of 15KV class 3 conductor (3/C) solid extruded insulation (EPR) cable. This cable construction features sectored aluminum conductors rather than concentric in an effort to reduce the overall diameter of the cable. Quality During the development of high voltage insulation, which has taken about half a century, two characteristics proved to be paramount. First, the introduction of the semiconducting layers. These layers must be absolutely smooth, without even protrusions as small as a few µm. Further the fusion between the insulation and these layers must be absolute;Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2, picture 8.1e any fission, air-pocket or other defect — again, even of a few µm — is detrimental to the cable. Second, the insulation must be free of inclusions, cavities or other defects of the same sort of size. Any defect of these types shortens the voltage life of the cable which is supposed to be in the order of 30 years or more.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2, pp. 87-91 Cooperation between cable makers and manufacturers of materials has resulted in grades of XLPE with tight specifications. Most producers of XLPE- compound specify an \\"extra clean\\" grade where the number and size of foreign particles are guaranteed. Packing the raw material and unloading it within a cleanroom environment in the cable-making machines is required. The development of extruders for plastics extrusion and cross-linking has resulted in cable-making installations for making defect-free and pure insulations. The final quality control test is an elevated voltage 50 or 60 Hz partial discharge test with very high sensitivity (in the range of 5 to 10 picocoulombs) This test is performed on every reel of cable before it is shipped. Figure 7: An extruder machine for making insulated cable HVDC cable A high-voltage cable for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission has the same construction as the AC cable shown in figure 1. The physics and the test requirements are different.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2, pp. 15-19 In this case the smoothness of the semiconducting layers (2) and (4) is of utmost importance. Cleanliness of the insulation remains imperative. Many HVDC cables are used for DC submarine connections, because at distances over approximately 100 km AC can no longer be used. The longest submarine cable today is the NorNed cable between Norway and the Netherlands, which is almost 600 km long and transports 700 megawatts, a capacity equal to a large power station. Most of these long deep-sea cables are made in an older construction, using oil-impregnated paper as an insulator. Cable terminals Figure 8, the earth shield of a cable (0%) is cut off, the equipotential lines (from 20% to 80%) concentrate at the edge of the earth electrode, causing danger of breakdown. alt= Terminals of high-voltage cables must manage the electric fields at the ends.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, pp. 53,147,153 Without such a construction the electric field will concentrate at the end of the earth-conductor as shown in figure 2. Equipotential lines are shown here, which can be compared with the contour lines on a map of a mountainous region: the nearer these lines are to each other, the steeper the slope and the greater the danger, in this case the danger of an electrical breakdown. The equipotential lines can also be compared with the isobars on a weather map: The denser the lines, the more wind and the greater the danger of damage. In order to control the equipotential lines (that is to control the electric field) a device is used that is called a stress cone, see figure 3.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, pp. 147-153 The crux of stress relief is to flare the shield end along a logarithmic curve. Before 1960, the stress cones were handmade using tape—after the cable was installed. These were protected by potheads, so named because a potting compound/dielectric was poured around the tape inside a metal/ porcelain body insulators. About 1960, preformed terminations were developed consisting of a rubber or elastomer body that is stretched over the cable end.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, fig. 10.7 On this rubber-like body R a shield electrode is applied that spreads the equipotential lines to guarantee a low electric field. The crux of this device, invented by NKF in Delft in 1964,Dutch Patent 123795, Netherlands Cable Works NKF, submitted 21-4-1964, granted 27-3-1968 is that the bore of the elastic body is narrower than the diameter of the cable. In this way the (blue) interface between cable and stress-cone is brought under mechanical pressure, so that no cavities or air pockets can be formed between cable and cone. Electric breakdown in this region is prevented in this way. This construction can further be surrounded by a porcelain or silicone insulator for outdoor use,see a similar case in Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, p. 160 or by contraptions to enter the cable into a power transformer under oil, or switchgear under gas pressure.see a similar case in Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, p. 157 Cable joints Connecting two high-voltage cables with one another poses two main problems. First, the outer conducting layers in both cables must be terminated without causing a field concentration,Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, p. 156 as with the making of a cable terminal. Secondly, a field-free space must be created where the cut-down cable insulation and the connector of the two conductors safely can be accommodated.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, p. 154 These problems were solved by NKF in Delft in 1965Dutch Patent 149955 of Netherlands Cable Works NKF, submitted 4-11-1965, granted 17-11-1976 by introducing a device called bi-manchet cuff. Figure 10 shows a photograph of the cross- section of such a device. At one side of this photograph the contours of a high-voltage cable are drawn. Here red represents the conductor of that cable and blue the insulation of the cable. The black parts in this picture are semiconducting rubber parts. The outer one is at earth potential and spreads the electric field in a similar way as in a cable terminal. The inner one is at high-voltage and shields the connector of the conductors from the electric field. The field itself is diverted as shown in figure 8, where the equipotential lines are smoothly directed from the inside of the cable to the outer part of the bi-manchet (and vice versa at the other side of the device).none none The crux of the matter is here, like in the cable terminal, that the inner bore of this bi-manchet is chosen smaller than the diameter over the cable insulation.Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1, p. 155 In this way a permanent pressure is created between the bi-manchet and the cable surface and cavities or electrical weak points are avoided. Installing a terminal or bi-manchet cuff is skilled work. The technical steps of removing the outer semiconducting layer at the end of the cables, placing the field-controlling bodies, connecting the conductors, etc., requires skill, cleanliness and precision.  Hand Taped Joints  Hand taped joints are the old school method of splicing and terminating cable. The construction of these joints involves taking several types of tape and manually building up appropriate stress relief. Some of the tapes involved could be rubber tapes, semiconducting tapes, friction tapes, varnished cambric tapes, etc. This splicing method is incredibly labor and time intensive. It requires measuring the diameter and length of the layers being built up. Often the tapes much be half lapped and pulled tight to prevent the formation of windows or voids in the resulting splice. Water proofing hand taped splicing is very difficult.  Pre-molded Joints  Pre-molded joints are injection molded bodies created in two or more stages. Due to automation, the faraday cage will have a precise geometry and placement not achievable in taped joints. Pre-molded joints come in many different body sizes that much be matched up to the cable semicon's outside diameter. A tight joint interface is required to ensure waterproofing. These joints are often pushed on and can cause soft tissue injuries among craftsmen.  Heat shrink Joints  Heat shrink joints consist of many different heat shrink tubes: insulating and conducting. These kits are less labor-intensive than taping but more than pre-molded. There can be concerns about having an open flame in a manhole or building vault. There can also be workmanship concerns with using a torch as the tubes must be fully recovered without scorching and any mastics used must flow into the voids and eliminate any air. Sufficient time and heat must be given. There are also a high number of components that must be placed in the correct order and position relative to the center of the joint.  Cold shrink Joints  Cold shrink is the newest family of joints. The idea is a polymer tube is formed at the correct diameter for the cable. It is then expanded over a form and placed onto a hold out tube at the factory. Then ready for installation the joint is very easily slipped over the cable end. After the connector is installed the splicer simply needs to center the joint body and then release the hold out. The tube will automatically recover to the original size. The only complication is cold shrink has a shelf life of approximately 2–3 years. After that time period the rubber will form a memory and not recover down to the intended size. This can lead to joint failure it not installed before the recommended date. From a utility perspective this makes it difficult to keep track of stock or retain emergency spares for critical customers. Cold shrink is the more rapidly growing area of distribution splices and thought to have the fewest workmanship issues with the quickest install times. X-ray cable X-ray cablesKreuger 1991 Vol. 1, pp. 65, 133 are used in lengths of several meters to connect the HV source with an X-ray tube or any other HV device in scientific equipment. They transmit small currents, in the order of milliamperes at DC voltages of 30 to 200 kV, or sometimes higher. The cables are flexible, with rubber or other elastomer insulation, stranded conductors, and an outer sheath of braided copper wire. The construction has the same elements as other HV power cables. Testing of high-voltage cables There are different causes for faulty cable insulation when considering solid dielectric or paper insulation. Hence, there are various test and measurement methods to prove fully functional cables or to detect faulty ones. While paper cables are primarily tested with DC insulation resistance tests the most common test for solid dielectric cable system is the partial discharge test. One needs to distinguish between cable testing and cable diagnosis. While cable testing methods result in a go/no go statement cable diagnosis methods allow judgement of the cable's current condition. With some tests it is even possible to locate the position of the defect in the insulation before failure. In some cases, electrical treeing (water trees) can be detected by tan delta measurement. Interpretation of measurement results can in some cases yield the possibility to distinguish between new, strongly water treed cable. Unfortunately there are many other issues that can erroneously present themselves as high tangent delta and the vast majority of solid dielectric defects can not be detected with this method. Damage to the insulation and electrical treeing may be detected and located by partial discharge measurement. Data collected during the measurement procedure are compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance test. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition of the tested cable.

His name was also transliterated as Si Hamed Ben Baxir Escuri or Escurri, Sidi Ahmed Bel Bashir Haskouri, Ahmer Ben Bazir Hasqouri, Ahamad Benbachir Scouri, Sid Ahmed Ben El Bachil Scuri, and Ahmad Ben Bachir El Hascori. After independence in 1956, he aided the administrative merger of the two previously separated zones. He then became a Moroccan diplomat, appointed by the palace rather than the Foreign Ministry, to the United Kingdom,“Ambassadors’ Night”, Tatler and Bystander Magazine, 1960, p 515.Raissouni, Mohammed Muntasir(1995). \\"Sha'ir El Wazir Mohammed Ben Musa\\" (Poeta Ministro Mohammed Ben Musa)Rabat, Marruecos: Companía de Publicación Okad p. 40 where he worked for Algerian independence.. Belbachir is known as a philanthropist, according to the Moroccan writer and historian, Mohammed Raissouni. Family Ben Azouz, the first prime minister of Spanish Morocco around 1912, was the most powerful Moroccan in Spanish Morocco at the time and was also known to be a nationalist. Since Belbachir's father was previously a military governor in charge of royal protocol in Marrakesh during pre-colonial times, Ben Azouz, a native of Marrakesh, was able to befriend him. Structure of the protectorate Spanish and French Morocco were protectorates rather than colonies. The relationship between French and Spanish Morocco was an agglutinative one as per the Algeciras Conference. This conference that took place shortly before 1912, the year of occupation, stated that Spain and France shall divide Morocco and that the former occupier shall leave whenever the latter occupier does so. The Concise Encyclopedia of Arabic Civilization states that the sultan appointed as representative a viceroy holding, by delegation, sovereign power.Ronart S. & Ronart, N. (1966). Concise Encyclopedia of Arabic Civilization. (Rev. ed.) New York, N.Y.: Frederick A. Praeger. p. 309. Ferro's article in Le Monde newspaper states that even though the sultan was technically Morocco's sovereign, the Spaniards, for the most part, increasingly treated the khalifa (viceroy), representative of the sultan in Spanish Morocco, as an independent entity.Ferro Maurice (January 1947). Lutte d’influence en Proche Orient. Le Monde, p. 1-2 Abramovici's article in the French newspaper called L’illustre, supports Ferro's statement about the khalifa's autonomy, but further defines the khalifa's position by stating that he had his own flag, decoration and hymn and that he was referred to by the public as “Sidna” (Sire).Abramovici Rene (June 23, 1949). Pendant Trois Semaines Tetouan a Vecu Les Mille Et Une Nuits. L’Illustre A Spanish newspaper called La Offensiva, complements both Ferro and Abramovici by stating that the khalifa had his own throne.El Jalifa celebra el anniversario de su exaltacion al trono. (November 10, 1949). Ofensiva, p. 1. The Spaniards treated the khalifa as a head of state in many different situations. For example, when Marshal Philippe Pétain was ambassador to Spain, he made it a point to visit the khalifa. During other visits in Spain, the khalifa would sit in the same car with General Francisco Franco as the car paraded the streets in Madrid. In sum, to make it clear to the world that the Spaniards viewed the khalifa as a head of state, the Spanish government awarded him the necklace of the order of Carlos III, an award that can only be bestowed upon heads of states by the Spanish monarch. Rise to power Belbachir made sure that such khalifal power maintained its sovereignty by enforcing and enlivening it. As time went by, the Spanish authorities came to the realization that the dialogue was strictly with Belbachir. After much political discussion with the Spanish authorities, Belbachir acquired enough leeway to act on his own initiative under certain circumstances. At one point, Belbachir chose to decorate Mustafa el-Nahhas, the First Secretary General of the Arab League, in the name of the khalifa. Furthermore, Dr. Shuqairi, the undersecretary of the Arab League, personally visited Belbachir in Tetuan to further reinforce Spanish Morocco's position in the Arab League.“Ductur Ahmed Shuqairi Fi Tetuan” (Doctor Ahmed Shuqairi in Tetuan) (December, 1953) Ma’ rifa p. 7.Hakim, Mohammed Ben Azouz (2008). \\"Mawqif Shamal Min I'tidae 'ala el 'Arsh Ghair Majri Tarikh\\" (Posicionalidad del Norte Acerca de la Injusticia sin Precedentes Cometida en contra del Trono). Tetuán, Marruecos: Compania de Publicacion Shuiakh. p.110 Belbachir also awarded a medal to Shuqairi in the name of the khalifa . This gave Spanish Morocco (in the name of the khalifa) certain credibility in the eyes of the Arab World. To maintain solidarity in the name of the khalifa with French Morocco, Belbachir saw to it that the foreign policy was always balanced by keeping the sultan in French Morocco aware. This was primarily maintained by keeping Ahmed Ben Masoud, the sultan's private secretary, posted. For the most part the sultan had no serious grievances, given the delegated powers bestowed upon the khalifa. There was only one exception to the rule when the sultan sent Belbachir several messages insisting that the khalifa should not wear an Ottoman outfit, a perceived symbol of a “western” imperial power, especially when foreign dignitaries were present. An inherited \\"colonial\\" problem In essence, Belbachir entered this political scene after the khalifa's position was fully defined, but it was not enforced at the time that the Spanish protectorate came into existence. He entered this political scene after the occupation was already in place for almost twenty years. Belbachir's tenure was during the second khalifate, a period that starts two years after the death of the first khalifa in 1923 in Spanish Morocco.Benjelloun, Abdelmajid (1988). Approches du colonialism espagnol et du movement nationaliste marocain dans l’ex-Maroc Khalifien. Rabat, Morocco: OKAD Publishing Company During the period from 1923 to 1925, a regent was playing the role of the khalifa. Upon the recommendation of a few potentates such as Ben Azouz, the second son of the first khalifa seized the throne. Absence in major Moroccan and world history books In 1949, Ben Brahim posed the \\"big\\" question about who was behind the major and increasingly ceremonial activities from way back that culminated with one that was tantamount to One Thousand and One Nights that occurred in Spanish Morocco. As implied by Ben Brahim, this politician's political biography cannot be found anywhere because Spanish/Moroccan history has not mentioned Ahmed Belbachir Haskouri enough. Consequently, the world as a whole has known less about him. This understanding holds water partly because Morocco's curricular canon during post-independence was primarily shaped by the dominant elite and secondarily shaped by the political parties. Furthermore, provincialism, coming form the city of Tetuan, the capital of Spanish Morocco and the city where he had no pre-existing roots, has also made a contribution to a greater or lesser degree along those lines insofar as official publications are concerned. On the other hand, historians during the Spanish government under Franco were unwilling to write about a politician who was a Moroccan nationalist and who was an obstacle to Spanish interests in Northern Africa. However, his name is omnipresent in the Spanish archives about Spanish Morocco that belong to Spain's national libraries. In contrast, some Moroccan historians and writers felt awkward about giving credit to someone who was operating in juxtaposition with the Spanish occupiers, thereby becoming a protectorate authority. This belief is erroneous for Belbachir who was born when the colonizers were already at the doorsteps of Morocco. Furthermore, someone needed to fill this position from the Moroccan side. Other earlier, but less biased historians (Moroccan or Spanish) have erroneously thought that, by using the term khalifa, the laity would interpret the achievements to be coming from Belbachir. This thinking was due to the life-time symbiotic existence between the khalifa and Belbachir. Overarching terms such as the makhzen, government, khalifa and other terms have been used (intentionally or unintentionally) to circumvent giving the politician credit.Marin Miguel (1973). El Colonialismo espanol en Marruecos. Spain: Ruedo Iberico By fully analyzing the term khalifa and the marginal role that the person holding this title can be limited to, due to circumstances, one can say that there is nothing incongruous and/or innovative about giving credit to the decision-maker rather than to the one who signs and seals the documents. . Family and educational background Ahmed Belbachir Haskouri was born in Marrakesh, Morocco. Mohammed Daoud tutored both the khalifa and Belbachir in Tetuan's palace where they both grew up. Belbachir was born into an aristocratic family allied to the Alaouite dynasty of Morocco through previous marital alliances and a long-standing high level service to various sheikdoms under the sultans of Morocco. (1229-1574). Eventually, from the area that became their new home. In the course of time, . . Later, he married Lalla Zoubeida Raissouni in 1950. . Sadiq was also ex-finance minister of the first khalifal government and both cousin and previous “interlocuteur” (political broker) of Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni. Mulai Ahmed was the most adamant rebel against both domestic and foreign powers during pre-colonial and colonial times and was later portrayed as the hero in the American movie called The Wind and the Lion. This alliance politically upgraded Belbachir in northern Morocco.“Afrah Tetuan fi bayt rais diwan el amer” (Celebrations in the house of the khalifal chief of cabinet) (1948, May 21). Rif, p. 1.Proxima Boda del Jefe de la Casa Civil de S.A.I. el Jalifa (1950, May 19). Espana, p. 2. Consequently, it made the public more receptive to the position of the khalifa, . Political ideologies Bachir, Ahmed Belbachir Haskouri's oldest son with Juan Carlos I of Spain in 2008. Belbachir was anti-Nazi,Baker, J. C. & Chase, C. (1993). Josephine: The Hungry Heart. New York: Random House anti-communist and pro-monarchist with progressive views. . Belbachir's political ideologies can be further understood through future encounters with the Spanish leaders. . . Place in Moroccan and world history Belbachir was one of the most prominent political figures in Spanish Morocco and was often alluded to as the “Éminence grise” of the caliph of Spanish Morocco as conveyed in 1988 by a Moroccan historian, Abdelmajid Benjelloun.Benjelloun, Abdelmajid (1988). Approches du colonialism espagnol et du movement nationaliste marocain dans l’ex-Maroc Khalifien. Rabat, Morocco: OKAD Publishing Company p. 289 Jean Wolf, a Belgian historian, further supported the term “Éminence grise” in 1994.Wolf, Jean (1994). Les Secrets du Maroc Espagnol: L’épopée D’Abdelkhalaq Torres. Morocco: Balland Publishing Company p. 282 He was the intermediary between the Sultan Mohammed V in French Morocco and the caliph of Spanish Morocco. He was also the only negotiator between Franco and the caliph as regularly evidenced by the Spanish newspaper called ABC especially by 1956.El Jalifa llega a Madrid. (March 18, 1956). ABC, p. 23 For example, . Furthermore, . Additionally, he was the politician from Spanish Morocco who could socially and politically communicate, especially during times of crises, with nineteenth-century politicians who were still around in the 1950s. to maintain balance and unity between the two protectorates. Furthermore, , the Grand Vizier of French Morocco at the time. Similarly, Belbachir is historically known to be in the higher social circles a politician from Spanish Morocco who negotiated, to the satisfaction of all domestic and foreign powers as well as Abd el-Krim's, the last phase of the latter's exile. That came to pass when . . Belbachir was a politician from Spanish Morocco who could communicate and financially support all the political parties in “colonial times”.Benaboud, Amhamed (1992). \\"Maktab El Maghrib El Arabi Fil Qahira\\" (Oficina del Magreb Arabe en Cairo)Rabat, Morocco: Compania de Publicacion Okad He was continuously touching base with the Istiqlal, Reformist (Islah), Unionist (Wahda) and Council (Shura) parties.. . Similarly, . . As time went by, he also chose many new employees that the Spaniards did not hesitate to approve of. In other words, the lack of a well-defined structure historically experienced gave way to the eventual crystallization of a new system that kept the former and new employees in check within the hierarchy. Miguel Marin stated that, by 1955, a new caliphal government emerged that included nationalists such as Abdallah Guennoun. However, the missing fact in Martin's account is that . Belbachir is also known to be a politician in the entire history of Spanish Morocco who politically dealt with fifteen consecutive High Commissioners, most of whom were generals, representing the Spanish government. Some of these commissioners were from the pre-republic, republic and Franco's time. In light of this, it goes without saying that every newly appointed High Commissioner had to inform Belbachir about his forthcoming arrival to Morocco to initiate a new dialogue.\\"Telegramas entre S.A.I. El Jalifa y El Nuevo Alto Comisario\\". (1951, April 4). ABC, p. 14 What is noteworthy herein is that General Franco was one of these commissioners at one point. . . . . . Finally, Belbachir was the first rebel during the Spanish Civil War to express a religious motivation. This was achieved by placing such dissidence on record in the name of the caliph. Therefore, the caliph's name went down on record to that effect.Raguer Hillary (2006). Gunpowder and Incense: The Catholic Church and the Spanish Civil War Volume 2. London: Routledge, p. 48 Positions in the khalifate Belbachir held high positions during the Spanish occupation, including Chief of Staff of the khalifa,\\"...al jefe del gabinete del jalifa, Ahmad Belbachir Haskouri\\", in España en Marruecos (1912-1956): discursos geográficos e intervención territorial. Milenio, 1999. Page 168. Chief of the Civil Household, Director General of the Secretariat of the khalifa, Secretary General of the Privy Council of the khalifa and Secretary General of the makhzen. Other positions were not officially granted, but implied, where the khalifa had no objections to Belbachir playing the chamberlain's role. American writers Dmitri Kessel and Paul Bowles described him as \\"advisor to the khalifa\\".Bowles, Paul (1952). Let it Come Down. (1st edition). London: John Lehman. p. 113. Similarly, in November 1949, La Ofensiva, a Spanish newspaper, referred to him as the chamberlain, receiving top officials of Franco's government in celebration of the khalifa's throne day. The accumulation of high positions together with his makhzen background and Spanish education allowed him to dominate Moroccan politics. Abdelmajid Benjelloun, in his doctoral dissertation, summed up Belbachir as the major architect and the pillar of the vice-regal system, the khalifal government, and key to communication with the Spanish authorities. Later career Belbachir used his power in Morocco to create and improve social programs and education, in discussion with the Spanish High Commissioners. This included preservation of Andalusian music in Morocco, and allowed Morocco to get into a more accommodating common platform with its Eastern and Northern neighbors. Belbachir worked on these social and political ties with Europe and the Arab World in a time of turmoil. During World War II he used the Spanish government to thwart the Nazis by offering visas and passports from Spanish Morocco to Jews. Belbachir died in London in 1962.

Russian Women's Fascist Movement (, Rossiiskoye Zhenskoye Fashistskoye Dvizheniye) was the women's wing of the All-Russian Fascist Party, which existed in Manchuria in the 1930s and 1940s. It was established in Harbin to unite women in Russia who \\"believe in God and desire a loving home and respectable work\\". Ideologically, the Russian Women's Fascist Movement (RGFD) adheres to Russian fascism, following the main slogan of Russian fascists \\"God, Nation, Labor\\". They supported the Russia of National Labor, which was built on a corporate system of Russian fascism in which a woman would achieve her \\"rightful place\\" in the law as the bearer of the idea of beauty and as the keeper of the home. Russian Women's Fascist Movement served as an autonomous section of the All-Russia Fascist Party (VFP), with its policy provided by the guidance of the RGFD and approved by the Head of the VFP. The Steering Center of the RGFD was established at the VFP congresses. Overall leadership of the movement belonged to the Head of VFP, who led through the RGFD Management Center. Regulations governing the RGFD center went into effect only after the approval of the VFP Head. The RGFD Steering Center consisted of a chairwoman, who was considered the chairperson of the RGFD as a whole.

He batted and threw right-handed. Cash earned his nickname \\"Ready\\" when he was benched and protested to a team manager, “When I put on the uniform, I’m ready to play”. Cash spent his entire Negro League career with the Philadelphia Stars. He also played minor league baseball for the Chicago White Sox’s farm teams and teams in Mexico, Canada, and Venezuela (Guerilus). After his retirement from baseball, Cash was an active member of the Philadelphia community  Early life  Cash was born to Arthur “Buster” Cash and Lela Lloyd Cash in 1919. He was born in Round Oak, Georgia. The family moved to an area of Philadelphia called Eastwick-Elmwood in 1924. Specifically, his family lived in the Meadows area near the Philadelphia International Airport. Cash graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia in 1939. At Overbrook, Cash was the only black player on the baseball and he quit the squad to play semi-pro ball elsewhere. Cash spent four years playing for semi-pro teams in Philadelphia, including the Camden Giants, the Black Meteors, and the Philadelphia Daisies (Negro Leagues Baseball Museum). Webster McDonald, manager of the Daisies, introduced Cash to Goose Curry, manager of the Philadelphia Stars, when he felt that Cash was ready to move up (Negro Leagues Baseball Museum). Curry ended up signing Cash to play for him.  Negro League Career  Cash began to play for the Philadelphia Stars in 1943. His batting average coming out of the semi-pros was .321, but he only batted .258 during his rookie season in the Negro League. His reputation was tarnished on Opening Day in 1946 during an argument with an umpire. In the skirmish, the umpire fell and while he was on his hands and knees, an angry Goose Curry, stormed the field and kicked him. Cash was suspended for three days and fined $25 for his role in the incident. Cash was slated to catch for Satchel Paige’s barnstorming All-Star team in 1946, but could not due to a broken thumb. He did participate in the East-West All-Star games of 1948 and 1949. Cash began the 1948 game as a substitute, but caught the entire game in 1949 in which he called the pitches as the East held a two-hit shutout of the West All-Stars.  Minor League Career  Cash's Negro League career came to an end in 1950 when he left the Stars only a few games into the season to join the Mexico City Red Devils. In Mexico, he batted .311, higher than any year he played with the Stars, and registered 15 home runs. Later, Cash went on to play for the Granby Red Sox in the Provincial League of Canada, batting .296 with 16 home runs. Cash signed with Chicago White Sox in 1952, hoping to play for their major league team, but was relegated to their farm teams instead. Cash claimed that the White Sox organization promised him a Class A position, but he was given a Class B position instead. He split the season with the Superior Blues in Superior, Wisconsin, (where he spent less than 10 games) and the Waterloo White Hawks in Waterloo, Iowa. He suffered more injuries throughout the 1952 season, battling bursitis in his shoulder and a broken leg. Cash hit .347, his highest batting average yet, with the Brandon Braves in 1953. For the next three years he played in the Dominican Republic for the Licey Tigers. Cash ended his baseball career in Bismarck, North Dakota, playing alongside other Negro League greats such as Ray Dandridge and Art Pennington. During his last season, he had a career-high batting average of .369.  Personal life  Cash met and fell in love with Sadie Bell Brooks in 1940. The couple married on September 7, 1940. They also had three children, William W. Cash Jr., Janet Cash, and Michael Cash. They were married for 63 years. His family was a great source of his pride. After Cash retired from baseball in 1955, he took a job at Westinghouse Electric, where he worked as a machinist for 30 years. It was a job that he enjoyed because he was training to become a machinist before he started to play baseball. He retired from Westinghouse in 1985. Cash was also very active in his local community, particularly with a dedication to helping the youth of Philadelphia. He was the founder of the Cobbs Creek Little League Association and vice president of the Foundation for Juvenile Decency. In addition to those positions, he also founded the Parkway Little League and served on the Board of Directors for the Negro League Baseball Players Association. He often spoke at schools, churches, and other venues about his life as a baseball player and what hurdles African Americans must overcome in America (Guerilus). Cash also contributed to the foundation of a group called Concerned Black Men who worked with the needy children of Philadelphia (Sports Reference LLC). Cash also held several positions as a clergyman in Philadelphia. He was a deacon at the Calvary Baptist Church in Philadelphia and later became a senior deacon at the First African Baptist Church in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, where he served for 30 years (Guerilus).  Awards & Recognition  Cash was inducted into the National Negro League Baseball Museum of History in 1981 (Hunt). He and other Negro League veterans were honored by President Bill Clinton at the White House in 1994 (Hunt). He was also honored by the City of Philadelphia, the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New York and the African American Museum in Philadelphia. Cash also made the 2006 Special Committee on the Negro League's preliminary ballot (Sports Reference LLC). He and Philadelphia Stars teammate Stanley Glenn were honored by the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on June 5, 2008, where they were both presented with Phillies jerseys (Hunt). Cash resides in the Douglas, Cheyney University, and Delaware County Halls of Fame (Negro Leagues Baseball Museum). Cash died on September 12, 2011 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the age of 92.

He lived in Philadelphia after his retirement as a player, rooming with former teammate George Johnson. After Dibo Johnson died, Cockrell led a fundraiser to get money for a memorial tablet for his grave. Cockrell was murdered in 1951 when he was shot by a jealous husband in a case of mistaken identity as he walked out of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania bar. He is buried at Mount Lawn Cemetery, Sharon Hill, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, USA.

He was primarily a catcher for the Kansas City Monarchs, handling their pitching staff from 1921 through 1934 as the team won five pennants between 1923 and 1931. While playing part-time, he managed the Monarchs to two pennants in 1942 and 1946.ksu.edu retrieved 19th Dec 2009 He caught two no-hitters with the Monarchs, in 1923 and 1929.  Early career  Duncan broke in with the 1920 Chicago Giants, forcing John Beckwith to move from catcher to shortstop. He hit just .161. In 1921, Duncan moved to the Monarchs and batted .250/.295/.277 (BA/OBP/SLG) for the combined season. In 1922, Duncan improved to .235/.317/.313 at the plate and was credited with 22 sacrifice hits to lead the Negro National League in that category. He led the NNL's catchers in fielding percentage (.984) and assists (91). In 1923, he batted .257/.332/.332 and fielded .960 while batting second for the pennant- winning Monarchs. That winter, he played for one of the most famous Cuban Winter League teams ever, the 1923–1924 Santa Clara Leopardos. He batted .336 and slugged .401 for the club, which won the pennant with a 36–11 record. Duncan batted .267/~.358/.332 in 1924, helping the Monarchs to the second of their three consecutive pennants. He was batted only .139 (5 for 36) in the 1924 Colored World Series, won by the Monarchs in 10 games. Despite the low batting average, one of his most memorable moments as a player came in Game Eight when he singled the tying and winning runs home in a dramatic ninth- inning comeback victory by his team. The play was notable because veteran catcher Louis Santop had dropped Duncan's foul pop-up one pitch before, and his key hit went through shortstop Biz Mackey's legs. Both Mackey and Santop were considered great defensive players, though Santop's best defensive days were behind him. Duncan hit only .200 for Santa Clara in the winter of 1924. In 1925, the catcher slipped to .222 for the Monarchs. He went 3 for 21 in the playoffs and 4 for 21 in the 1925 Negro World Series. He again had a huge moment in the series, with a great tag on Otto Briggs at home in the 11th inning of game one. Duncan batted .247 in 1926. In June, he was in the middle of a fight when he collided with John Hines. During the melee, he was struck on the back of the head by the butt of a policeman's pistol. While Duncan was down, Jelly Gardner kicked him in the mouth with his spikes. In the winter of 1926–1927, Duncan batted .276 and slugged .328 in the California Winter League. In 1927, the Kansas City native hit .395 while splitting time with T.J. Young. Had he qualified, he would have ranked 4th in the NNL in batting average. Duncan took part in a memorable tour of Japan by Negro League players that year; the blackball stars won 23 games, tied once and lost none. The fall trip included stops in Hawaii, China, Russia and the Philippines. In the winter of 1927–1928, Duncan was 8 for 21 with two doubles in the California Winter League. In 1928, Duncan batted just .182. With Cienfuegos that winter, he hit .265 and slugged .434. His 8 stolen bases were second on the team behind Cool Papa Bell. Duncan hit .346 in 1929. That winter, he hit .250 for Cienfuegos and slugged .369. Duncan hit .370 in 1930, tying for third in the NNL behind only Mule Suttles and Willie Wells. He was 5 for 13 with a triple for Cienfuegos in the 1930 CWL before the season was cut short. In the Campeonato Unico that replaced the CWL that year, he hit .276 with no extra- base hits in 29 AB for the Cienfuegos club. Duncan hit .297 in 1931 in the Negro leagues. He moved to the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1932 but only managed a .211 mark.  Later career  In 1935, Duncan had a .102 batting average for the New York Cubans. He followed with a .239 average in 1936 and was 0 for 3 in an exhibition against the Cincinnati Reds. In 1937, Duncan returned to Kansas City and hit .173. In the final postseason series, he was 3 for 17. He went 2 for 12 in exhibitions against white major leaguers that fall. Duncan came back in 1938. He hit .247 for Kansas City and .378 for Chicago. His 4 triples led the Negro American League. In the 1938 East-West Game, he was 0 for 1 with a walk as the West's starting catcher and #7 hitter in a 5–4 win. He started a double play with a pick-off of Sammy T. Hughes during the game. Larry Brown took over behind the plate for Duncan. In 1939, Duncan played for a semipro team.  Father-son battery  Duncan played alongside his son, pitcher Frank Duncan III, in 1941, and they are thought to have been the first father-son battery in professional baseball history. Duncan went 0 for 4 against Bob Feller and Ken Heintzelman in exhibitions in 1941.  Managerial career  He became Kansas City's playing manager in 1942, leading them to a league title, and then won the 1942 Negro World Series, sweeping the Homestead Grays four games to none. Duncan was drafted into the US Army for World War II after the 1942 season. He became sergeant in the 371st Infantry Regiment of the 92nd Division. He showed off his precision by hitting 31 bull's eyes in 32 shots in rapid firing from 200 yards, a marksmanship record. He was honorably discharged early in 1943 and returned to manage the Monarchs in 1943 before the season began. In 1944, at 43 years old, he hit .144, and the Monarchs finished last for the first time in their history, having lost much of their best players to the war. He was Jackie Robinson's first professional manager in 1945. He led Kansas City to the 1946 Negro World Series, which they lost in seven games to the Newark Eagles. He retired from managing after the 1947 season, turning over managerial responsibilities to Buck O'Neil. He umpired in the NAL for a while after that. He also ran a tavern in retirement.  Personal life  Duncan was married to noted blues singer Julia Lee. She frequently performed in all-white nightclubs, and Duncan had to sit with the orchestra, pretending to be a musician, in order to see her perform.

In newspaper reports, he is often referred to as \\"Bill\\" Holland, and had the nicknames of \\"Speed\\" and \\"Devil.\\" Early Career Holland debuted in Richmond, Indiana as a teenager in 1918 with the Richmond Giants, a team that had also featured Negro League legends Oscar Charleston and Connie Day during the season. Holland started games on consecutive days, pitching twenty innings in less than twenty-four hours. He only allowed five earned runs while striking out twenty-four hitters. After the Negro National League was founded, Holland got his start working for the Indianapolis ABCs baseball club, before being sold to the Detroit Stars in 1920. It was with the Stars that he pitched with other Negro League greats like Andy Cooper, Bill Gatewood, Tom Johnson and Gunboat Thompson. After three seasons with Detroit, he moved to the East Coast and spent the rest of his career working for the Lincoln Giants, Brooklyn Royal Giants, and the New York Black Yankees. Later Career In 1930 Holland went 29-2 for the Lincoln Giants and was the first black player to ever pitch at Yankee Stadium. He was also voted to the 1939 East-West All-Star Game. At age 51, Holland received votes listing him on the 1952 Pittsburgh Courier player-voted poll of the Negro Leagues' best players ever.\\"1952 Pittsburgh Courier Poll of Greatest Black Players\\" Nickname Holland eventually acquired the nickname “Devil” because of a legendary competitive streak.

And you knew it. He’d look at you mad, (and) let you know he’s going to throw at you: ‘Get ready to duck now.’” Rankings In Negro League History According to Seamheads, in official league games across Negro League history, Holland ranks fifth in strikeouts and complete games (1,094 and 173 respectively), and tenth in wins (116).

The battle had long been the focus of propaganda in the history of Chinese Communist Party but had become Peng Dehuai's \\"crime\\" during the Cultural Revolution. Certain issues regarding its launching and consequences are still controversial. Background In 1939–1940, the Japanese launched more than 109 small campaigns involving around 1,000 combatants each and 10 large campaigns of 10,000 men each to wipe out Communist guerrillas in the Hebei and Shandong plains. In addition, the army of Wang Jingwei's collaborationist Reorganized National Government had its offensive against the CCP guerrillas. There was also a general sentiment among the anti-Japanese resistance forces – particularly in the Kuomintang – that the CCP was not contributing enough to the war effort, and that they were only interested in expanding their power base. It was out of these circumstances that the CCP planned to stage a great offensive to prove that they were helping the war effort and to mend KMT-CCP relations. Battle The Japanese North China Area Army estimated the strength of communist regulars to be about 88,000 in December 1939. Two years later, they revised the estimate to 140,000. On the eve of the battle, the Communist forces grew to 400,000 men strong, in 105 regiments. The extraordinary success and expansion of the 8th Route Army against the Japanese had Zhu De and the rest of the military leadership hoping that they could engage the Japanese army and win. By 1940, growth was so impressive that Zhu De ordered a coordinated offensive by most of the communist regulars (46 regiments from the 115th Division, 47 from the 129th, and 22 from the 120th) against the Japanese-held cities and the railway lines linking them. According to CCP's official statement, the battle started on 20 August. From 20 August to 10 September, communist forces attacked the railway line that separated the communist base areas, chiefly those from Dezhou to Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan in central Shanxi, and Taiyuan to Datong in northern Shanxi. Originally Peng's order of battle consisted of 20 regiments and on 22 August he found more than 80 regiments took part, mostly without telling him. They succeeded in blowing up bridges and tunnels and ripping up track, and went on for the rest of September to attack Japanese garrisons frontally. About of railways were destroyed, and the Jingxing coal mine—which was important to the Japanese war industry—was rendered inoperative for six months. It was the greatest victory the CCP fought and won during the war. However, from October to December, the Japanese responded in force, reasserting control of railway lines and conducting aggressive \\"mopping up operations\\" in the rural areas around them. On 22 December, Mao Zedong told Peng Dehuai \\"Don't declare the end of the offensive yet. Chiang Kai-shek is launching anti-communist climax and we need the influence of Hundred Regiment Battle to win propaganda.\\" Results The Eighth Army had left two reports that are both based on statistics before December 5, one claiming the killing or injuring 12,645 Japanese and 5,153 puppet troops; the capturing of 281 Japanese and 1,407 puppet troops; the defection of 7 Japanese and 1,845 puppet troops; 293 strong-points taken. The other one claimed the killing or injuring of 20,645 Japanese and 5,155 puppet troops; the capturing of 281 Japanese and 18,407 puppet troops; the defection of 47 Japanese and 1,845 puppet troops defected; 2,993 strongpoints taken.王人广《关于百团大战战绩统计的依据问题》(Wang Renguang),《抗日战争研究》1993年第3期, p. 243 These two records were both based on the same figure but separated to two different records for unknown reason. This amounted to 21,338 and 46,000 combat successes respectively. In 2010, a Chinese article by Pan Zeqin said that the combat success result should be more than 50,000.《说不尽的百团大战》 (2) 中国共产党新闻>>资料查询>>档案·记忆>>史海回眸2007年06月04日08:43《中国人民解放军全史》军事历史研究部 编，军事科学出版社，2000年，，卷“中国人民解放军战役战斗总览” There are no figures concerning total casualties in Japanese military records but 276 KIAs were recorded for the 4th Independent Mixed Brigade and 133 KIAs and 31 MIAs for the 2nd Independent Mixed Brigade.『北支の治安戦（1）』ASIN: B000J9E2P6, p. 316 A western source recorded 20,900 Japanese casualties and about 20,000 collaborator casualties. The Chinese also recorded 474 km of railway and 1502 km of road sabotaged, 213 bridges and 11 tunnels blown up, and 37 stations destroyed. But Japanese records give 73 bridges, 3 tunnels, and 5 water towers blown up; 20 stations burned, and 117 incidents of railway sabotage (amounting to 44 km). The damage done to communication systems consisted of 1,333 cable posts cut down and 1,107 turned over, with up to 146 km of cable cut. One mining site of Jingxing Coal Mine also stopped operating for half a year.森松（1982）、136頁。 Aftermath When General Yasuji Okamura took command of the North China Area Army in the summer 1941, the new strategy was \\"Three All\\", meaning \\"kill all, burn all, and destroy all\\" in those areas containing anti-Japanese forces. Mao never would again mount any convention or massed guerrilla campaign during the war. Controversies Peng and Mao had disagreed over how directly to confront the Japanese since at least the Luochuan Conference in August 1937, with Mao concerned about Communist losses to the well equipped Japanese. After the establishment of the People's Republic Mao is alleged to have said to Lin Biao that \\"allowing Japan to occupy more territory is the only way to love your country. Otherwise, it would have become a country that loved Chiang Kai- shek.\\"Andrew Bingham Kennedy, Can the Weak Defeat the Strong? Mao’s Evolving Approach to Asymmetric Warfare in Yan’an The China Quarterly Volume 196 (December 2008), pp. 892-893. Thus, the Hundred Regiments Offensive became the last of the two major Communist frontal engagements against the Japanese during the war. There had been controversy that Peng had no authorization, even no knowledge of the Central Military Committee and Mao Zedong. As early as 1945 the accusation of launching battles without telling Mao had appeared in the North China Conference. During the Great Leap Forward, Peng's opposition to Mao's policies led to his downfall and then the launching of the battle became yet again a criminal action in the Cultural Revolution. In 1967, the Red Guard group of Tsinghua University, with the support of the Central Cultural Revolution Committee, issued a leaflet saying \\"The rogue Peng, along with Zhu De, launched the offensive to defend Chongqing and Xi'an... He rejected Chairman Mao's instruction and mobilized 105 regiments in an adventuristic impulse ... Chairman Mao said 'How can Peng Dehuai make such a big move without consulting me? Our forces are completely revealed. The result will be terrible.'\\"Original words:：1940 年 8 月——12 月，彭贼伙同朱德等发动了‘百团大战’，公然提出要‘保卫大后方’‘保卫重庆’‘保卫西安’……拒不执行毛主席提出的我军‘基本的是游击战，但不放弃有利条件下的运动战’的方针，大搞冒险主义、拼命主义，先后调动了一百零五个团，共四十万兵力……全线出击，打攻坚战、消耗战。百团大战，过早暴露了我军力量……毛主席早在百团大战进行时就严厉地批评了彭德怀等的错误做法，毛主席说：‘彭德怀干这么大事情也不跟我商量，我们的力量大暴露了，后果将是很坏。’---浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部：《毛主席革命路线胜利万岁 --党内两条路线斗争大事记（1921-1968）》(Zhejiang Province Revolutionary Uprising Combined Headquarters:Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolution route- Chronicles of the conflict of two routes within Party 1921–1968) 1969 May, p. 79 Peng admitted in his memoir 彭德怀自述 that he ordered the launch in late July, without awaiting the green light from the Central Military Committee and he regretted it. But Pan Zeqin said that it was Peng's incorrect memory, the correct start date should have officially been on August 20, so Peng actually had the green light.The original texts are 实际上，百团大战发起日期是8月20日，比原定日期8月10日左右（《战役预备命令》中规定的）推迟了10天，而并非是提前了10天，这当是彭德怀记忆之误。此点说明百团大战不是彭德怀背着中共中央军委擅自发动的。 Nie Rongzhen defended Peng, stating \\"there is a legend that the Central Military Committee was not informed about the offensive in advance. After investigation, we found out that Eighth Army HQ sent a report to the top. The report mentioned we would strike at and sabotage Zhentai Railway. Sabotaging one railway or another is very common in guerilla warfare so it's our routine work. This is not some strategic issue and the Committee won't say no\\". He mentioned no exact date of launch.Original words:有种传说，说这个战役事先没有向中央军委报告。经过查对，在进行这次战役之前，八路军总部向中央报告过一个作战计划，那个报告上讲，要两面破袭正太路。破袭正太路，或者破袭平汉路，这是游击战争中经常搞的事情，可以说，这是我们的一种日常工作，不涉及什么战略问题。这样的作战计划，军委是不会反对的 The consensus in China after the Cultural Revolution is generally in support of the battle. But a modern Chinese article stated that \\"Liu Bocheng had another opinion on Peng's arbitrary launching of the battle.\\" While a successful campaign, Mao later attributed it as the main provocation for the devastating Japanese Three Alls Policy later, and used it to criticize Peng at the Lushan Conference.

Pollock (1940–2009) was an American philosopher known for influential work in epistemology, philosophical logic, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Life and career Born John Leslie Pollock in Atchison Kansas, January 28, 1940, Pollock earned a triple-major physics, mathematics, and philosophy degree at the University of Minnesota in 1961. In 1965, his doctoral dissertation Analyticity and Implication at the University of California, Berkeley was advised by Ernest Adams (making Pollock an intellectual descendant of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant, through Ernest Nagel and Patrick Suppes).http://johnpollock.us/ This dissertation contained an appendix on defeasible reasoning that would eventually blossom into his main contribution to philosophy. Pollock held faculty positions at SUNY Buffalo, University of Rochester, University of Michigan, and University of Arizona, where he spent most of his career. At Arizona, he helped found the Cognitive Science Program. He was an avid mountain biker and founded a riding club in Southern Arizona. Philosophical work Knowledge and Justification Knowledge and Justification is the book that established Pollock in epistemology. It appeared at a time when American philosophy, and especially American epistemology, was obsessed with the analysis of what it means to know something. For instance, the Gettier problem, one of the most frequently discussed problems of the day, asks why it is that holding a \\"justified true belief\\" that x is not equivalent to knowing that x. Pollock's book steps back from trying to identify the \\"analytic criteria\\" which might constitute the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge. His epistemic norms are governed by defeasible reasoning; they are ceteris paribus conditions that can admit exceptions. Several other epistemologists (notably at Brown University, such as Ernest Sosa,and especially Roderick Chisholm), as well as his Arizona colleague Keith Lehrer, had written about defeasibility and epistemology. But Pollock's book, which combined a broad scope and a crucial innovation, brought the ideas into the philosophical mainstream. Defeasible Reasoning Pollock became known as \\"Mr. Defeasible Reasoning\\" among philosophers in the two decades before his death. In Artificial intelligence, where non-monotonic reasoning had caused intellectual upheaval, scholars sympathetic to Pollock's work held him in great esteem for his early commitment and clarity. Pollock's most direct pronouncement is the paper \\"Defeasible reasoning\\" in Cognitive Science, 1987, though his non-syntactic ideas were almost fully mature in Knowledge and Justification. Pollock traced the history of his own thinking (e.g., in a footnote in Pollock and Cruz, Contemporary Theories of Knowledge, 1999, p. 36, note 37, and elsewhere) to his first paper on epistemology, \\"Criteria and our knowledge of the material world,\\" Philosophical Review 76, 1967. He thought that Roderick Chisholm had influenced his thinking on the subject, but he also said he was attempting to interpret Ludwig Wittgenstein directly, and sometimes credited Stephen Toulmin on the subject of argument. Although his work had considerable impact in the area of Artificial intelligence and law, Pollock was not himself interested much in jurisprudence or theories of legal reasoning, and he never acknowledged the inheritance of defeasible reasoning through H.L.A. Hart. Pollock also held informal logicians and scholars of rhetoric at a distance, though defeasible reasoning has natural affinities in argument (logic). Pollock's \\"undercutting defeat\\" and \\"rebutting defeat\\" are now fixtures in the defeasible reasoning literature. He later added \\"self-defeat\\" and other kinds of defeat mechanisms, but the original distinction remains the most popular. Although aided by a strong tail wind from AI and a few contemporary like minded philosophers (e.g., Donald Nute, Nicholas Asher, Bob Causey), it is certain that defeasible reasoning went from the obscure to the mainstream in philosophy because of John Pollock, in the short time between the publication of Knowledge and Justification and the second edition of Contemporary Theories of Knowledge. OSCAR / How to Build a Person Pollock devoted considerable time later in his career to a software project called OSCAR, an artificial intelligence software prototype he called an \\"artilect\\". OSCAR was largely an implementation of Pollock's ideas on defeasible reasoning, but it also embodied his less well known and often unpublished ideas about intentions, interests, strategies for problem solving, and other cognitive architectural design. OSCAR was a LISP-based program that had an \\"interest-based\\" reasoner. Pollock claimed that the efficiency of his theorem-prover was based on its unwillingness to draw \\"uninteresting\\" conclusions. Although OSCAR did not benefit from the contributions of a large number of professional programmers, it must be compared to CyC, Soar (cognitive architecture), and Novamente for its inventor's ambition. Pollock described Oscar's main features as the ability to reason defeasibly about perception, change and persistence, causation, probabilities, plan construction and evaluation, and decision. He described the evolution of Oscar in the Fable of Oscar in his book. OSCAR grew out of the Prologemena on How to Build a Person, which colleagues must have assumed was a facetious use of personhood at the time. However, Pollock's own attitude toward OSCAR was more machinating: he looked forward to future cognitive taxonomies that would classify OSCAR generously as a legitimate anthropomorphic form. Nomic Probability Nomic Probability and the Foundations of Induction, Oxford, 1990 was Pollock's deep investigation of the relationship between defeasible reasoning and the estimation of probability from frequencies (direct inference of probability). It is a maturation of ideas originally found in a 1983 Theory and Decision paper. This work must be compared to Henry E. Kyburg's theories of probability, although Pollock believed that he was theorizing about a broader variety of statistical inferences.

Between 1990 and 1995, she studied Art at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem. During this time, she spent one-semester as an exchange student at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City. She currently lives and works in Israel with her partner in life and art Yotam From and her daughter Imree.

Her complex works touch on social, historical, political, and ecological issues, embracing topics such as homelessness, banishment, and the relationships between victim and victimizer and between decay and growth. As much of her work is concerned with the human condition, the body (often her own) is a key motif and guide. Using salt, sugar, paper and ready-made objects, Landau creates large-scale in site installations, which totally change the spaces she works in. One of Landau's best-known works is Salt Works, a series of salt sculptures created by immersing metal sculptural frames into the Dead Sea. Exhibitions 1990s In 1994, Landau showed in the group exhibition 'Tranzit' in the haunted spaces of floor 5, at the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station, and in Export Surplus, the Bugrashov Gallery's street show. Both shows were part of ArtFocus 1, and both early exhibitions dealt with nomadism and place, and deciphering the essence of these sites. In one, she inhabited a homeless shelter; in the other Landau created a castaway group show on the water breakers in front of Bugrashov beach. In 1995 she showed her work Iron Door Tent with Guy Bar Amoz at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. In 1996 Landau exhibit at the 'Witte de With'. Following her Rotterdam experience, Landau made and showed 'Resident Alien I' the following year in the Herzliya Museum, and after that in Documenta X and at the 47th Venice Biennale. She deformed the metal floor of the cargo containers using heat and intense hammering to look like a function as hills. Landau represented Israel at the Venice Biennale in 1997 and again in 2011. She exhibited at Documenta X in 1997. In 1999 Landau exhibited her work in the Chisenhale Gallery, London, and then at Spacex in Exeter. The following year, she won the first Times/ArtAngel Open commission: to transformed a concrete mixer into a music box, she had every intention of \\"living in it forever and traveling with the story performed with it in the streets…\\". 2000s In her 2001 New York City Exhibition, Sigalit turned the Thread Waxing space into a cotton candy crater, spinning the sweet fibers around herself and the audience, to the music of \\"Arab-Snow\\". DeadSee, Israel Museum Returning to Israel during the time of the Second Intifada, she worked with Haaretz newspaper front pages, transforming them each day into sculptures of fruit. Her outdoor drying area was the studio's roof, where she took her replete balls-crops-growths to dry. These balls were main part of her \\"The Country\\" Installation (2002) at the Alon Segev Gallery in Tel Aviv-Yafo.

The battle was the first major Chinese victory of the war. It humiliated the Japanese military and its reputation as an invincible force, while for the Chinese it represented a tremendous morale boost. Tai'erzhuang is located on the eastern bank of the Grand Canal of China and was a frontier garrison northeast of Xuzhou. It was also the terminus of a local branch railway from Lincheng. Xuzhou itself was the junction of the Jinpu railway (Tianjin-Pukou), the Longhai railway (Lanzhou-Lianyungang), and the headquarters of the KMT's 5th War Zone.  Background   Political and strategic situation  By 1938, the Chinese military had suffered tremendous losses following the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing. In particular, its air force and navy had both been virtually wiped out. Nonetheless, China's resolve in resisting the Japanese invasion showed no signs of weakening. On 30 January, the Japanese military high command, after evaluating the situation in China, decided that no new offensive operations shall be conducted until August. Emperor Hirohito's stance was even more conservative: he believed that it would take at least a year for the Japanese to solidify their positions in their newly captured territory and consolidate their strength before conducting any further operations. Thus, the Japanese high command decided to wait until 1939 before conducting a swift, aggressive offensive in order to decisively end the war in China. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek refused to accept the Japanese terms for surrender, resulting in Japan publicly declaring: \\"From now on, we will no longer negotiate with the KMT government (今後不以國民政府爲談判對手).\\" On 20 February, China withdrew its ambassador Xu Shiying (:zh:許世英) from Japan. The next day, Japan followed suit, withdrawing its ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru (:ja:川越茂). Earlier that year, Chiang had also resigned from his post as Premier of the Executive Yuan, in order to fully dedicate his efforts to the war. The respective actions taken by both sides was indicative of their attitude towards the war: China was now fully committed, while Japan still showed some signs of hesitation.  Military situation  Despite Hirohito's declaration that no new offensives would be conducted in 1938, the Japanese forces in China were eager to continue their offensive, with morale reaching a peak following the Fall of Nanjing and subsequent Nanjing Massacre. The IJN's preferred strategy would have been to continue advancing westwards along the Yangtze River to invade Wuhan. However, the IJA was reluctant to continue following this approach of following waterways, and instead pursued the Chinese army retreating from the Shanghai-Nanjing theatre, driving northwards into the three provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong and Henan. A significant proportion of the Chinese forces that withdrew from Shanghai crossed the Yangtze River northwards into the Jiangbei (:zh:江北) region. During the retreat from Nanjing, many scattered Chinese troops also found themselves drifting down the Yangtze and into Jiangbei. The IJA saw this as an opportunity to pursue and destroy this cluster of disorganized Chinese troops, thus ignoring the IJN's strategy of following the Yangtze westwards. Throughout December 1937, Rippei Ogisu’s 13th Division pursued the fleeing Chinese forces, capturing Jiangdu (:zh:江都), Shaobo (:zh:邵伯), and advancing into Anhui to capture Tianchang (:zh:天长). Simultaneously, in Northern China, Rensuke Isogai's 10th Division, advanced southwards between Qingcheng (:zh:青城) and Jiyang (:zh:济阳) to cross the Yellow River, approaching the Jiaoji railway. Gaining access to the railway would enable it to move westwards then southwards to clear the Jinpu railway and join forces with the 13th division at Xuzhou. From there, the combined Japanese forces could attack Wuhan and force the KMT into surrender. The war had thus moved from the 3rd to the 5th War Area.  The Chinese 5th Theatre  The Chinese 5th Theatre was bordered by the Yellow River in the north, Yangtze River in the south, and Yellow Sea in the east. The area encompassed all of Shandong province, as well as parts of Anhui and Jiangsu. Its commander was Li Zongren (:zh:李宗仁), and its deputy commanders were Li Pinxian (:zh:李品仙) and Han Fuju (:zh:韩复榘), the latter also being the chairman of Shandong. Despite having risen through the ranks and followed Chiang Kai-shek in the Second Northern Expedition, Han was unable to shake the habits of warlordism: seeking to preserve the strength of his forces, he disobeyed direct orders to defend the northern section of the Jinpu railway, withdrawing his force, the 3rd Army Group, westwards without ever engaging the Japanese. This opened up a large gap in the 5th War Area's northern region, allowing the Japanese 10th Division to capture Zhoucun (:zh:周村). On the 27th, the Japanese captured Jinan (:zh:济南), and in less than a week they had also captured Tai'an (:zh:泰安).  Xuzhou  The Japanese advance on Xuzhou consisted of three routes: # 13th Division, commanded by Rippei Ogisu, advancing northwards from Nanjing. # 5th Division, commanded by Seishiro Itagaki, amphibiously landing at Qingdao, and advancing along the Taiwei Highway. # 10th Division, commanded by Rensuke Isogai, advancing southwards from Hebei. An ancient city, Xuzhou was a hub linking together the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. It was also a junction connecting the Longhai and Jinpu railways. The Grand Canal also ran adjacent to it, connecting the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The city was also the cradle of Han culture, and, for thousands of years, had been a city of vital military importance, with more than 200 wars having been fought in its vicinity over the course of 4000 years. Capturing Xuzhou would allow the Japanese to advance westwards to attack Zhengzhou via the Longhai railway, and from there drive southwards to attack Wuhan via the Pinghan railway.  Prelude   The Chinese Army  At the time, the NRA 5th War Area lacked significant military strength. This was a serious issue given the vital importance of Xuzhou. Its commander, Li Zongren, was an old rival of Chiang Kai-shek. While they had become sworn brothers during the Northern Expedition, their intense rivalry quickly ignited almost immediately afterwards, culminating in the Central Plains War. Although their rivalry would never come to an end, they set it aside for the time-being to focus on the war effort against Japan, with Chiang sending his Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi to Xuzhou in January 1938. Li and Bai were old comrades from the New Guangxi Clique, and had served alongside each other since the Battle of Longtan in the Northern Expedition. At the request of Bai, Chiang sent Li the 3rd War Area's 21st Army Group. Also a unit from Guangxi, the 21st was commanded by Liao Lei (:zh:廖磊) and consisted of the 7th and 47th Corps. At this time, Sun Zhen's (:zh:孙震) 22nd Army Group, a unit from the Sichuan clique also arrived at the Shanxi-Henan region, only to be rejected by both Yan Xishan (commander of the 2nd War Area and chairman of Shanxi) and Cheng Qian (commander of the 1st War Area and chairman of Henan). Both Yan and Cheng disliked units from Sichuan for their poor discipline, particularly their rampant opium consumption. During the 1930s, opium consumption was widespread in Sichuan and Yunnan. Furthermore, China's extreme poverty, which was substantially exacerbated by the Japanese invasion, meant that opium tax remained an important source of income for regional governments. Under the command of Sun Zhen, the 22nd Army Group had deployed four of its six divisions to assist the war effort in Northern China. Organized under the 41st and 45th corps, the contingent began its foot march towards Taiyuan on 1 September, marching for more than 50 days continuously and covering some 1400 kilometers. When they arrived in Shanxi, they were confronted with an icy winter. Despite lacking winter uniforms or even a single map of the province, they immediately engaged the Japanese for 10 days at Yangquan (:zh:阳泉), incurring heavy casualties. Desperately low on supplies, they broke into one of the Shanxi clique's supply depots, infuriating Yan Xishan, who expelled them from the province. The 22nd then withdrew westwards into the 1st War Area, only for its commander, Cheng Qian to reject its request for resupplies. At this time of desperation for the 22nd, Bai Chongxi asked Li Zongren whether he was willing to accept this Sichuan unit. Li responded by saying, \\"Back in the day, Zhuge Liang dared to even use straw soldiers to acquire arrows. Surely these Sichuan troops cannot be worse than straw soldiers. Give them to me.\\" Thus, the 22nd gratefully entered Shandong, where it was deployed to the northern section of the Jinpu railway. With Sun Tongxuan's 3rd Army Group on its left flank, the 22nd faced the Japanese 10th Division, led by Rensuke Isogai at Tai'an. At the time, poor discipline was commonplace amongst the Chinese Army's regional units, which were often hastily drafted and organized from bandit groups and led by officers two thirds of whom were illiterate. Poor discipline also pervaded the higher ranks, with Han Fuju being an archetypal example. Seeking to stamp out this problem, Chiang conducted a military conference at Kaifeng on 11 January to produce a collective report on military discipline. Attending the conference were high ranking general officers from the 1st and 5th War Areas, including Han Fuju. After the conference, Han was arrested and detained in Wuhan. Under the direction of the director of military law, Tang Shengzhi, who had led the defense of Nanjing a year earlier, Han was sentenced to death and executed on the 24th, at the age of 49, making him the first Chinese high ranking general officer to have been executed in the war. Han's execution had a significant impact on military discipline throughout the Chinese Army. Matters discussed at the Kaifeng conference included not only wartime punishments, but also rewards. The NRA's system of rewards and punishments would be rigorously carried out until the end of the war. Sun Tongxuan succeeded Han as acting commander of the 3rd Army Group, whose later admirable performance during engagements along the northern section of the Jinpu railway would become a representative example of the impact of the NRA's reorganization of military discipline. By February 1938, the 5th War Area had mustered a total of 29 divisions, with a total strength of 288,000 men. This force consisted entirely of various regional units from across China: * Sun Zhen's (:zh:孙震) 22nd Army Group and Yang Sen's (:zh:杨森) 6th Army Group were from the Sichuan clique * Han Deqin's (:zh:韩德勤) was formed from the Jiangsu Peace Preservation Corps. * Pang Bingxun's (:zh:庞炳勋) 3rd Army and Zhang Zizhong's (:zh:张自忠) 27th Army were from the Northwestern Army. * Liao Lei's (:zh:廖磊) 21st Army Group and Li Pinxian's (:zh:李品仙) 11th Army Group were from the New Guangxi Clique. * Yu Xuezhong's (:zh:于学忠) 51st Corps was from the Northeastern Army. * Sun Tongxuan's (:zh:孙桐萱) 3rd Army Group was a unit from Shandong.  The Japanese advance  = Southern route = Commanded by Rippei Ogisu, the Japanese 13th Division, drove westwards from Nanjing via two columns in early February: the northern column advanced towards Mingguang (:zh:明光), while the southern column advanced towards Chuxian (:zh:滁县). Both columns were checked by Wei Yunsong's (:zh:韦云淞) 31st Corps, which had been tasked with defending the southern section of the Jinpu railway by Li Zongren. Despite facing a completely inferior enemy, the Japanese were unable to make any progress even after more than a month of continuous attacks. The Japanese then deployed armoured and artillery reinforcements from Nanjing. The Chinese responded by withdrawing westwards to the southwestern outskirts of Dingyuan (:zh:定远) in order to avoid direct confrontation with their reinforced foes. By this time, Yu Xuezhong's (:zh:于学忠)'s 51st Corps had already positioned itself defensively on the northern banks of the Huai River, forming a defensive line between Bengbu (:zh:蚌埠) and Huaiyuan (:zh:怀远). The Japanese proceeded to successively capture Mingguang, Dingyuan, and Bengbu before advancing towards Huaiyuan. However, their supply routes were then intercepted by the Chinese 31st Corps, which conducted flanking attacks from the southwest. The Japanese situation was worsened further when the Chinese 7th Corps (led by Liao Lei) then arrived at Hefei, reinforcing the 31st Corps. Engaged by three Chinese corps simultaneously, the Japanese were trapped south of the Huai River and unable to advance any further despite enjoying complete air superiority and having a complete advantage in firepower. The Chinese had thus foiled the Japanese plan of advancing their 13th Division northwards along the Jinpu railway and joining forces with Isogai Division (10th Division) to launch a pincer attack on Xuzhou. = Northeastern route = After amphibiously landing at Qingdao, the Japanese 5th Division (commanded by Seishiro Itagaki), advanced southwestwards along the Taiwei Highway, spearheaded by its 21st Infantry Brigade. There they faced the Chinese 3rd Army Group, commanded by Pang Bingxun. Despite being designated as an army group, Pang's unit only consisted of the 40th Corps, which itself only consisted of the 39th Division, a unit from the Northwestern Army. Led by division commander Ma Fawu (:zh:马法五), the 39th's five regiments ended up delaying the Japanese advance towards Linyi (:zh:临沂) for over a month. The Japanese captured Ju County (:zh:莒县) on 22 February and pushed towards Linyi on 3 March. However, they were met by a stiff Chinese counterattack, which checked them at the Taoyuan (:zh:桃园) region. The Japanese then conducted heavy aerial bombardment on the single Chinese division, forcing it to withdraw into Linyi. During this time, Zhang Zizhong's 59th Corps, also a Northwestern unit, had moved eastwards from Xuzhou along the Longhai railway, passing Tai’erzhuang before advancing northwards towards Linyi. It crossed the Yi River (:zh:沂河) on 12 March and attacked the Japanese left flank, engaging them from 13 to 18 March, during which the 39th Division managed to push the Japanese out of the Linyi region. Pursued by the Chinese from two directions, the Japanese were forced to withdraw, losing almost two entire battalions in the process. This engagement broke the myth of Japanese invincibility and also humiliated Japanese commander Seishirō Itagaki, even shocking the IJA headquarters. Although the Japanese 5th Division later regrouped and tried again, it had lost the element of surprise. The Japanese defeat at Linyi at the hands of the inferiorly trained and equipped Chinese regional units set the scene for the eventual battle at Tai’erzhuang . = Northern route = Of the three Japanese divisions driving into the Chinese 5th War Area, the 10th Division, commanded by Rensuke Isogai, was the most successful. Setting out from Hebei, it crossed the Yellow River and moved southwards along the Jinpu railway. With KMT General Han Fuju having ordered his forces to desert their posts, the Japanese successfully captured Zhoucun and moved into Jinan without meeting any resistance at all. The Japanese then advanced southwards along two columns from Tai'an. The eastern column captured Mengyin (:zh:蒙阴) before pushing westwards to capture Sishui (:zh:泗水). The western column advanced south- westwards along the Jinpu railway, capturing Yanzhou (:zh:兖州), Zouxian (:zh:邹县), and Jining (:zh:济宁), before driving north-westwards to capture Wenshang (:zh:汶上). Chiang Kai-shek then ordered Li Zongren to utilize 'offensive defense' (), i.e. seizing the initiative to actively attack, instead of passively defending. Thus, Li deployed Sun Zhen's 22nd Army Group to attack Zouxian from the south while Pang Bingxun's 40th Division advanced northwards along the 22nd's left flank to attack Mengyin and Sishui. Sun Tongxuan's 3rd Army Group also advanced from the south, launching a two- pronged attack on the Japanese at Jining. Fighting fiercely from 12 to 25 February, the respectable combat performance of the 12th Corps in particular helped to ameliorate the reputational damage that Han Fuju had otherwise inflicted upon on the Shandong units. The Japanese made some strategic changes as a result of these Chinese counterattacks: they cancelled their original plan of directly advancing westwards from Nanjing to Wuhan, so that more troops could be spared for the push towards Xuzhou. The Japanese engaged Sun Zhen's 22nd Army Group in more than 30 days of ferocious combat south of Zouxian, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese and forcing them to withdraw to Teng County on 15 March. Defense of the county itself was delegated to the 41st Corps' 122nd Division. Led by Wang Mingzhang (:zh:王铭章), the 122nd was a division in name only - in reality it only consisted of seven companies. Even with the addition of scattered elements of the 45th Corps withdrawing from the Jiehe River (:zh:界河 (独山湖)), its total strength was only a little over 2,000 men. A support group formed by citizens from Chengdu arrived at the county to support the troops from their hometown, gifting them a banner that read: \\"Children of Tianfu, Serve the country and resist the Japanese\\" (). On 16 March, the Japanese deployed a force primarily composed of the Watanabe () detachment to launch a three-pronged offensive on the county under the cover of heavy aerial and artillery bombardment. The Japanese successfully broke into the county the next day and began engaging the Chinese in house-to- house combat. By the afternoon, Chinese division commander Wang Mingzhang had suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and proceeded to commit suicide. Nonetheless, the Chinese still stubbornly held onto the county for two more days. By dusk on 19 March, the Chinese had suffered 1800 killed and 300 wounded. The remaining 300 wounded soldiers fought until they could no longer hold the line, before committing mass-suicide by grenades in order to avoid capture. While Teng County fell, the NRA Military Affairs Commission redeployed Sun Lianzhong's 2nd Army Group, a Northwestern unit, and Tang Enbo's 20th Army Group, a Central Army unit, from the 1st War Area to reinforce the 5th War Area. While the 2nd Army Group consisted of two Corps, its strength had been greatly diminished during the Defense of Niangzi Pass, reducing its actual strength to that of three divisions. Its order of battle was as follows: * 30th Corps - Tian Zhennan (:zh:田镇南) ** 30th Division - Zhang Jinzhao (:zh:张金照) ** 31st Division - Chi Fengcheng (:zh:池峰城) * 42nd Corps - Feng Anbang (:zh:冯安邦) ** 27th Division - Huang Qiaosong (:zh:黄樵松) ** 44th Brigade - Wu Pengju (:zh:吴鹏举) Noting that Northwestern units had been consistently capable at defensive combat, 5th War Area commander Li Zongren gave the responsibility of defending Tai'erzhuang to Sun Lianzhong, who stationed Chi Fengcheng's 31st Division inside the district. Meanwhile, the 20th Army Group consisted of four full-strength, partially German trained divisions. Its order of battle was as follows: * 52nd Corps - Guan Linzheng (:zh: 关麟征) ** 2nd Division - Zheng Dongguo (:zh:郑洞国) ** 25th Division - Zhang Yaoming (:zh:张耀明) * 85th Corps - Wang Zhonglian (:zh:王仲廉) ** 4th Division - Chen Daqing (:zh:陈大庆) ** 89th Division - Zhang Xuezhong (:zh:张雪中) The 85th Corps moved eastwards to Xuzhou from Shangqiu along the Longhai railway, before advancing northwards via the Jinpu railway to arrive at Lincheng (:zh:临城), where it immediately engaged the Japanese pressing southwards from Teng County. While the series of engagements up to this point had resulted in the Japanese suffering some losses, ultimately the overwhelming disparity in weapons and equipment had left the Chinese with no option but to form line after line of near-suicidal resistance in successive desperate attempts to delay the Japanese advance. The Japanese utilized their devastatingly superior firepower and mobility to destroy Chinese lines of resistance, eventually capturing Yi County (:zh:峄县) and Zaozhuang (:zh:枣庄) by mid-March after two days of fierce combat. Tang Enbo requested Chiang Kai-shek for permission to send forth the 52nd Corps, which had been stationed at Boxian (:zh:亳县). Chiang complied, and the 52nd moved eastward along the Longhai railway, passing Xuzhou and arriving at Tai’erzhuang, before advancing northwards past Yi County to attack Zaozhuang. The Chinese suffered heavy casualties here. For example, 2nd Division veteran Wang Jialin () recalled in an interview in 1995 that out of his entire company, only 10 soldiers survived. Unwilling to risk losing the Central Army's elite divisions, Li Zongren withdrew both the 85th and 52nd Corps from their head-on engagements with the Japanese. Li believed it was better to instead open up a route for the Japanese to drive southwards into Tai'erzhuang, because, as long as Chi Fengcheng's 31st Division could hold onto the district, Tang Enbo's 20th Army Group could then maneuver around the rear of the Japanese forces to encircle them and give the Chinese the upper hand. Rensuke Isogai's 10th Division was not actually supposed to have driven deep into enemy territory and attack Tai'erzhuang alone. Rather, it was supposed to have waited for Rippei Ogisu's 13th Division to close in on Xuzhou and Itagaki Seishiro's 5th Division to pass Linyi for additional security. However, Isogai was confident enough in his forces, and planned to take out Tai'erzhuang in a single swift blow to complete the objective of clearing the Jinpu railway. Thus, he continued advancing his force southwards towards the district. Seeing the Japanese 10th Division continuing to press forward, Tang Enbo ordered Chi Fengcheng to send out a small force to the north and attack them and lure them into Tai’erzhuang. This plan of baiting the Japanese into the district was successful, and Isogai deployed 40,000 troops and around 80 tanks to attack Tai'erzhuang from the north. Beginning on 21 March, the Japanese Air Force launched an extensive bombing operation on the Chinese positions, forcing the civilians to flee in terror. By 23 March, artillery fire could be heard from inside the district. The next day, KMT Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek flew to the front lines to inspect the defenses, and left General Bai Chongxi there to help Li Zongren. The Battle of Tai'erzhuang had begun.  Battle   Tai'erzhuang  Tai’erzhuang was situated in the southern end of Shandong, close to the border with Jiangsu. It was a large village under the administration of Yi County (:zh:峄县). Because Southern Shandong had historically been the site of many wars, many of its villages had walls around them, akin to fortresses. Tai’erzhuang was one of them. The district was 1.2 km long from east to west. Its eastern end was the widest, with a width of 1 km from north to south. Of its more than ten streets, the three streets in the centre had flourished with business before the battle. The district also had six wall gates and nine watchtowers, and was home to more than 3,000 households. On the eve of the battle its residents had all been evacuated to Fuyang (:zh: 阜阳) and other areas. The district would quickly be reduced to complete ruins by Japanese aerial and artillery bombardment.《国殇1937—1945年中日战争正面战场纪实》 第十六集：徐州会战（下） The Grand Canal ran along Tai’erzhuang's southern border, just outside its southern gate. Following the canal south-eastwards would lead to Yangzhou (:zh:扬州) and eventually the Yangtze River. Following it north-westwards would lead to Jining (:zh:济宁) and eventually the Yellow River. The district was approximately 2 km east of the Taizao railway line's northern station (). Following the railway northwards would connect it to the Jinpu railway, while following it southwards would connect it to the Longhai railway via Zhaodun. To the northeast of the district was the Taiwei Highway which connected with the Jiaoji railway at Wei County (:zh:潍县). Thus, Tai’erzhuang carried significant economic importance in peacetime. In wartime, it served as the northern gateway to Xuzhou, and was a point that the Japanese had to pass if they wanted to continue advancing southwards. Chi Fengcheng, commander of the Chinese 31st Division, positioned his 184th Regiment (led by Wang Zhen (:zh:王震) inside the district itself. He deployed his 182nd Regiment to the west, at the northern railway station, while the 183rd and 181st Regiments respectively guarded the western and southern areas outside the district. Chi positioned his divisional command post at the southern railway station, which was on the southern bank of the Grand Canal.  Battle  On 25 March, the Japanese launched an all-out attack on Tai’erzhuang, with a 300-strong contingent successfully breaching the north-eastern gate. However, they were then forced into the Chenghuang temple. The Chinese then set fire to the temple, killing the entire Japanese force. The next day, the Japanese launched another assault through the breached gate. While they were again forced into the Chenghuang (city god) temple, the Chinese were unable to repeat the same tactic of burning the temple, since they had already burned everything that was flammable the previous day. The Japanese were thus able to use the temple as a base, from which they began to systematically clear the district block by block, launching at least seven attacks per day. In the house-to-house combat that followed, the Chinese struggled to hold the line in the face of vastly superior firepower. The Japanese eventually secured the eastern portion of the district, before also breaching the north-western corner from the outside and capturing the Wenchang Pavilion (). By this time, the district had been completely reduced to ruins, with not a single house left intact. The other three Chinese regiments fiercely fought the Japanese on the district's outer approaches, each expending six to seven thousand rounds of ammunition daily. These defensive actions on the outskirts were vital to preventing the Japanese from expanding the breach and annihilating the single Chinese regiment inside the district. Bai Chongxi had arrived at Tai’erzhuang on the same day as the initial Japanese attack, and quickly realized that the Chinese position would be untenable without additional firepower. Thus, he redeployed the Central Army's 8th Artillery Regiment to aid in the defense, and also borrowed a number of anti-tank guns from the 1st War Area. The anti-tank guns arrived on 27 March and immediately went into action at the district's outskirts: at noon the Chinese battery engaged a Japanese squadron of nine tanks, knocking out five of them. The Chinese troops in the trenches cheered enthusiastically before scrambling out to swarm the Japanese tanks. Stunned, the Japanese did not open fire for an entire five minutes. On 29 March, a small band of Japanese soldiers tunneled under Tai'erzhuang's walls in an attempt to take the district from within; they were caught by the Nationalist defenders and killed. On the same day, Wang Zhen (CO of the Chinese 184th Regiment) was wounded in street fighting, and was replaced by Wang Guanwu (:zh:王冠五). As the acting regimental CO, Wang Guanwu formed a 72-strong assault team in commemoration of the 27th anniversary of the Second Guangzhou Uprising and its 72 Martyrs. Setting out from the south of the district, the assault team stormed the Wenchang pavilion from the south and east, annihilating the entire Japanese garrison with the exception of four Japanese troops taken as POWs. The Chinese had thus retaken the north-western corner of the district. Of the 72 Chinese soldiers, 14 were killed in action. During this time, Sun Lianzhong's 30th Division, 27th Division, and Wu Pengju's independent 44th brigade had assembled at Tai’erzhuang's outer approaches, respectively positioning themselves at the western, south-western, and eastern outskirts of the district. A unit from Yunnan, Lu Han (:zh:盧漢)’s 60th Corps also arrived at the 5th War Area, and was incorporated into Sun Lianzhong's 2nd Army Group's order of battle. It consisted of the 182nd, 183rd, and 184th Divisions. While the 31st Division continued to defend Tai’erzhuang and its surrounding areas, the aforementioned units launched simultaneous attacks on the Japanese north of the district, seeking to relieve the pressure on the 31st Division. The 30th Division, 27th Division, and 44th Brigade respectively attacked Nanluo) :zh:南洛) from the southwest, Sanlizhuang (:zh:三里庄) from the south, and Liujiahu (:zh:劉家湖) from the east. The 60th Corps also joined the attack. However, the Japanese rushed in their 10th and 63rd Infantry Regiments southwards from Yi County to bolster their position, repelling the Chinese attacks and forcing them to withdraw to their original positions. It was during this time that the Japanese 5th Division also drove south-westwards from Linyi. Led by the Sakamoto detachment, it overran Xiangcheng (:zh:向城) before also capturing Aiqu (:zh:愛曲). By this time, the Chinese 2nd Army Group's casualties had already reached 50%. The Chinese situation was desperate. The 31st Division having sustained extremely heavy casualties from seven days of continuous fighting, its commander, Chi Fengcheng, requested permission from 2nd Army Group commander Sun Lianzhong to withdraw to prevent complete annihilation. Sun in turn telephoned 5th War Area commander Li Zongren, reporting: > The 2nd Army Group has already reached 70% casualties. The enemy’s firepower > is too strong and their offensive is too fierce, but we have almost > completely depleted their strength. Sir, could I request permission to > temporarily withdraw to defend the canal’s southern bank, so that the North- > western Army can at least have some survivors? Sir, this would be a great > act of grace on your part. > (第二集團軍已傷亡十分之七，敵人火力太強攻勢太猛，但是我們把敵人也消耗得差不多了，可否請長官答應暫時撤退到運河南岸，好讓第二集團軍留點种子，也是長官的大恩大德。) Counting on Tang Enbo's reinforcements arriving north of the district the next day before noon, Li resolutely responded: > We have viciously fought the enemy at Tai’erzhuang for a week. Victory and > defeat are decided in the final five minutes. Reinforcements will arrive > tomorrow at noon, and I will personally be coming to Tai’erzhuang in the > morning to supervise the battle. You must hold out until dawn and organize > night attacks. Persistence is victory. Once reinforcements arrive tomorrow, > we will be able to launch a pincer attack on the enemy from the inside and > outside [of the district]! This is my order - if you disobey it, you will be > court-martialed! > (敵我在台兒莊已血戰一週，勝負之數決定於最後五分鐘，援軍明日中午可到，我本人也將於明晨來台兒莊督戰，你務必守到明天拂曉，並要組織夜襲，堅持就是勝利，待明天援軍到後，我們就可以對敵人內外夾攻！這是我的命令，如違背命令，當軍法從事！) Sun replied: > Yes, sir. I will absolutely follow your order. We will keep fighting until > the entire army group is annihilated.(好吧，長官，我絕對服從命令，整個集團軍打完為止！) When 31st Division commander Chi Fengcheng was relayed this order from Sun, he ordered the demolition of the temporary bridge over the grand canal, which was his division's only retreat route from Tai’erzhuang. Chi was determined to fight to the last man and defend the district until death. Li Zongren's strategy now completely relied on the ability of Tang Enbo's 20th Army Group to maneuver around the Japanese to cut off their supply lines, block their retreat paths, and form a counter-encirclement to surround and simultaneously destroy them from the inside and outside . From the outset of the battle, the 20th Army Group had been conducting offensive operations northwest of Tai’erzhuang, with the 85th and 52nd Corps engaging the eastern flanks of the Japanese 10th Division's rear positions at Zaozhuang and Yi County respectively. By 31 March, the Chinese 52nd Corps had already fought its way to the outskirts of Beiluo (:zh:北洛). However, with the Japanese 5th Division capturing Xiangcheng during this time, Tang Enbo decided to adjust his strategy. He maneuvered his 52nd and 85th Corps eastwards to Lufang (:zh:鲁坊) and Daliangbi (:zh:大良壁) respectively, with the 85th Corp's 4th Division holding at Lanling (:zh: 蘭陵), just south of Aiqu, thus forming a defensive line stretching from Lanling to Liujiahu, and from Liujiahu to Lufang. Additionally, overconfidence had led the Japanese commanders to overlook the thousands of inconspicuous \\"farmers\\" in the area, who were affiliated with Li Zongren and cut communication lines and supplies, diverted streams, and wrecked rail lines. By late March, supplies and fuels were being dropped from airplanes to Japanese troops, but the quantity was insufficient. On 1 April, the Japanese 5th Division's Sakamoto detachment rushed towards (:zh:岔河), with the aim of joining forces with the 10th Division at Tai’erzhuang's perimeter. Tang Enbo gave the Japanese free passage along Taiwei highway, luring them into his trap. With ten days of continuous fighting inside Tai’erzhuang having resulted in extremely heavy casualties on both sides, the Japanese tried to break the stalemate by unleashing poison gas on the entrenched Chinese defenders in an attempt to dislodge them. Nonetheless, the Chinese continued to stubbornly hold onto the district. By 3 April, the Tang Enbo's 20th Army Group had completely repelled the Japanese Sakamoto detachment's intrusion. The Japanese were forced to withdraw all the way back to Linyi. The next day, Tang split his force into three columns to launch a coordinated counteroffensive on the Japanese 10th Division: # The 52nd Corps would set out from Lanling, driving westwards to attack Yi County. # The 85th Corps would set out from Daliangbi, also driving westwards to attack Yi County. # The 75h Corps (which had recently arrived in the region and was led by Zhou Yan (:zh: 周碞)), would set out from Chahe and maneuver northwesterly around the Japanese eastern flank to arrive at Zhanglou (:zh:張樓), in order to cover the 52nd and 85th Corps’ maneuvers. On the same day, the Chinese 2nd Army Group also launched a counter-offensive, with the 30th and 110th Divisions fighting northwards into Beiluo and Nigou (:zh: 泥溝) respectively. On 6 April, the Chinese 85th and 52nd Corps linked up at Taodun (:zh: 陶墩), just west of Lanling. The combined force then drove north-westwards, capturing Ganlugou (:zh:甘露溝). With the various Chinese counter-attacks all accomplishing their objectives, the Japanese line finally collapsed, and both the 10th and 5th Divisions were forced to retreat. However, vastly superior mobility allowed the Japanese to prevent a complete rout by the pursuing Chinese forces.  Reasons for the Japanese failure  Some of the most critical reasons for the Japanese failure are as follows: 1\\\\. In the prelude to the battle, the Japanese were hampered by the ‘offensive defensive’ operations conducted by the various Chinese regional units, which effectively prevented the three Japanese divisions from ever achieving their objective of linking up with one another. 2\\\\. Despite repeatedly deploying heavy artillery, air strikes, and gas attacks, the Japanese were unable to force the Chinese 2nd Army Group from Tai’erzhuang and its surrounding regions, even as the defenders risked complete annihilation. 3\\\\. The Japanese failed to prevent the Chinese 20th Army Group's maneuver around their rear positions, which cut off their retreat routes and gave the Chinese the advantage of a counter-encirclement. 4\\\\. Following Han Fuju's insubordination and subsequent execution, the Chinese military's high command rigorously adjusted the tone at the top by clamping down on military discipline, which pervaded down throughout the ranks and resulted in even the most junior soldiers willing to risk their lives in the course of carrying out their orders. For example, a \\"dare to die corps\\" was effectively used against Japanese units. They used swords and wore suicide vests made out of grenades. Due to lack of anti-armor weaponry, suicide bombing was also used against the Japanese. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. Dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Tai’erzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers obliterated four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles. Model 24 hand grenades to use in an attack on Japanese tanks Aftermath The defeat was a significant blow to the Japanese military. It was the first major Japanese defeat since the beginning of the war, broke the myth of Imperial Japanese military invincibility, and resulted in an incalculable benefit to Chinese morale. Amid the celebrations of the victory in Hankou and other Chinese cities, Japan initially denied its defeat and ridiculed the reports of the battle for days. It was reported in the foreign newspapers, however. The battle also resulted in significant casualties and losses for the Japanese, who claimed to have suffered a total of 11,918 casualties The Chinese claimed to have annihilated 24,000 Japanese troops in addition to shooting down 3 aircraft and destroying or capturing approximately 30 tanks and more than 10 other armoured vehicles. The Chinese also recorded taking 719 Japanese troops as prisoners, and captured large quantities of military supplies, including approximately 70 artillery pieces (including 31 heavy artillery), 100 cars and trucks, 900 to 1,000 machine guns and 10,000 rifles. Furthermore, the battle became an important symbol of Chinese unity since the various Chinese units that had participated in the campaign were all from a myriad of different cliques, which had been at war with one another merely seven years ago. In particular, the North-western Army, which had played a significant role in fighting Chiang's loyalist forces as part of the anti-Chiang coalition, played a pivotal role in the campaign. Furthermore, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, whom Chiang Kai-shek had previously labelled as rogues and expelled from the KMT for life, took a leading role in commanding the battle. Finally, the successful defense bought the Chinese time to withdraw government staff, refugees, factories, and resources in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River westward from the war areas via Hankou and thus played a pivotal role in supporting the overall Chinese resistance strategy.

Life Harriet Ludlow Clarke was the fourth daughter of Edward Clarke, a London solicitor. Around 1837 she started trying to earn a living as a wood engraver, which was then unusual for a woman. Attracting the notice of the engraver William Harvey, she executed a large cut from his design for the Penny Magazine in 1838. With Harvey's support, Clarke earned a good deal of money, which she used to build model labourers' homes at Cheshunt. A friend of Anna Jameson, she contributed some of the illustrations to Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art, as well as making engravings of classic paintings for The Art Journal. In 1841, she and her sister Elizabeth (wife to the legal reformer Charles Henry Bellenden Ker) were depicted sketching from a balcony in a popular oil painting by Charles Eastlake.Michael Cohen, Sisters: relation and rescue in nineteenth-century British novels and paintings, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1995, p. 36 Clarke also became a designer and painter on glass, studying at home and abroad to master the techniques, and helped by the leading stained glass painter William Wailes. About 1851 she executed a window, showing Saint Martin sharing his cloak with a beggar, in St Martin's Church, Canterbury, which was being restored by the Hon. Daniel Finch. From 1852 to 1854 she was commissioned by Henry Berens to paint two windows for the new church at Sidcup, and on Berens's death executed a further window erected by subscription to his memory. She executed for the queen a large window in the church of North Marston, to commemorate a bequest to her majesty by Mr. Neald of an estate in that parish. The Rev. Robert Moore employed her to execute a large window in the north-west transept of Canterbury Cathedral, representing the history of Thomas a Beckett. Though she prepared full-sized colour cartoons for this, failing health prevented her from executing her designs on glass: the windows were put up in May 1863 by Mr Hughes of Frith Street, Soho.

Life In 1207, Grzymisława married Leszek the White, Prince of Kraków. This marriage was part of Leszek's avowed policy of eastward expansion. After the assassination of her husband (24 November 1227), she became regent on behalf of her minor son Bolesław V the Chaste. After becoming independent, Bolesław still received considerable influence from his mother regarding his government. Grzymisława was closely linked with the Monastery of the Franciscans in Zawichost, where she became a benefactress. She died between 14 June and 24 December 1258, with a possible date of 8 November.

The company were general millwrights, also producing some steam engines during the 19th century and after 1904 produced large steam-driven engines for textile mills in Oldham. History John Urmson and John E Thompson started business in 1865 in Hathershaw, Oldham. While Urmson was a trained engineer who had worked at Woolstenhulmes & Rye, Thompson is thought to have contributed capital. Thompson died in 1882, and Urmson with his sons John and Andrew continued the business. On the sons' death in 1888 the firm was incorporated, and continued until 1933. The firm operated out of the Hathershaw Foundry. Initially millwrights, in the 1870s they started making stationary steam engines as well. From 1904 they made a series of large mill engines. The largest was a 2000ihp engine for Ace Mill Co. Ltd., Chadderton in 1914. This was erected in 1919. The later engines were large. Arthur Roberts reported that Hartford Mill was powered by an 1800 hp twin-tandem compound engine by Urmson and Thompson, built in 1907. It was steamed at 160 psi at 68 rpm. It had a 5 ft stroke driving a 24 ft flywheel. The transmission method was a rope drive using 40 ropes. The engine was reputed to be the only twin-tandem that Urmson & Thompson built. It had two 30\\" diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinders at the rear, and two 60\\" LP (low-pressure) cylinders in front. There were Corliss valves on all cylinders. The air pumps were driven from each crosshead. There was a Whitehead governor. The engine cost £5400 and the three boilers cost £1900.George Watkins differed in the detail, proposing it was a 1500 hp engine with 21\\" and 44\\" cylinders on a 5 ft stroke, that was steamed at 170psi. The 24 ft flywheel drove 34 ropes. George Watkins.

Life and work  Heinrich Bocksieper was born on 15 April 1898 in Hagen, Germany. His grandfather was a metalsmith who ran a smithery, his father was a self-employed master-painter. Primary schooling in Hagen was followed by one year of business school. After that Brocksieper attended a professional school for painting in Hagen from 1915 to 1916 where he joined classes in drawing, painting and design.Hermanns, U. and Siebenbrodt, M. (1998) Heinrich Brocksieper: Nahsichten. Weimar: Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar. Career From 1916 to 1918 during World War I he served his compulsory military service in Russia and France, fell sick with a lung infection in the trenches of the Western front and was hospitalized. After the end of the war he returned to Hagen to continue his studies at the Malerfachschule until 1919. In 1919 he was inspired by the \\"Hagener Impuls\\" of Karl Ernst Osthaus, who showed the first big exhibition of Lyonel Feininger in Hagen's Museum Folkwang, and supported by his teacher Max Austermann, Brocksieper took up studies at the newly founded Bauhaus in Weimar, starting the winter semester of 1919. From 1919 to 1922 he studied at the Bauhaus in Weimar. He attended the newly established preliminary course of Johannes Itten, along with his fellow artists from Hagen, Reinhard Hilker and Erna Mayweg. He participated in exhibitions for the first time in 1920; the development of the illness he caught in the war forced him to interrupt his studies and leave for recuperation in Merano (South Tyrol). Back at the Bauhaus, he continued his studies until 1922, working in the graphic printing workshop of Lyonel Feininger,Graphic printing: Bauhaus100 (Accessed: 11 December 2016). who has a formative influence on Brocksieper's artistic development. He spent the years 1923 and 1924 traveling with a friend, Hugo Isenberg, in southern Germany, Austria and Italy. There they earned their living with the restoration of works. In 1924 Brocksieper left for another recuperation stay in Merano. In Hagen, Hannes Behler, Albert Buske, and Will Lammert were among his fellow artists. He encouraged his friend August Agatz to enrol at the Bauhaus in Dessau. Albert Buske, Max Gebhard and Waldemar Alder follow him to undertake their studies there. Until 1927 he was a member of the artist group \\"Hagenring\\" and participated in their exhibitions. From 1927 on photography and film dominated his artistic work. He established a photo and film studio and created \\"perpelleristische Filme\\" (propellering rotating animations) and cartoons on 35mm film, which he processes himself. With numerous trips to Weimar, Dessau and Berlin he kept close contact with the Bauhaus until 1933. After his father's death, he earned his livelihood in his mother's small paint and glass shop while he continued his art. In the early 1930s in addition to his film studio Brocksieper also operated a second small studio in Hagen-Wehringhausen where the young painter Emil Schumacher (1912–1999), who was living in the neighborhood, was one of his frequent guests, with which he shared frequent artistic exchanges until the mid-1950s. In 1933 he denied studio visits and exhibition participations to the Nazis. In 1938 he married Annemarie Brocksieper, their first son Utz was born in 1939, followed by their son Klaus († 1995) born in 1940. In World War II he saw compulsory military service on the Eastern and Western fronts. In 1944 Brocksieper's house and studio were destroyed in bombing raids and his paintings, drawings, photos and films were destroyed with only fragments remaining. Post War After the war he resumed his artistic work making linear and charcoal drawings. He discovered the \\"perspective of close objects\\" utilizing \\"tactile viewing\\", and henceforth based all his paintings on those concepts. He resumed contact to his friends from the Bauhaus, wrote to Maria Rasch and to Gustavo Keller-Ruiz in Chile. In 1950 an exchange of letter ensued between him and Lyonel Feininger in New York. In 1954 Brocksieper made his first post-war trip to Weimar where he met old friends from the Bauhaus, including Harry Scheibe and Martin Pohle. In Weimar he got to know graphic artist and lyricist Arno Fehringer (1907–1974) with whom he exchanged many letters until his death. His late work developed as follows: every day objects with signs of usage, portraits and self-portraits focused on imaging the substance were the central theme of his pastel drawings which he created following his formula \\"FORM, FARBE + MATERIE\\" (shape, colour + substance). Until his death he earned his living in his small paint and glass shop. He died in Hagen on April 24, 1968. A summary of all periods of his work - drawings done at the Bauhaus in 1919, early photographs, fragments of film works, linear charcoal and pastel drawings, as well as the exchange of letters with Feininger are today owned by the Klassik Stiftung Weimar, Bauhaus Museum.

Nuclear power  Croatia has no nuclear power plants on its territory. Croatia co-owns the Krško Nuclear Power Plant together with Slovenia; the Krško plant was built in the era of Yugoslavia on the territory of present-day Slovenia. As of 2008, 17% of Croatia's electric energy consumption is supplied by Krško plant, which is expected to be decommissioned in 2023. In 1978, the Adriatic island of Vir was selected as a location for a future nuclear power plant, but these plans were abandoned. According to reports, since 2009 Croatia has been discussing the option of building a nuclear power plant with Albania, in a location on the shore of Shkodër Lake, on the border with Albania and Montenegro.

It was the first steamboat built in the Oregon Territory, and the first to establish regular service on the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. This vessel should not be confused with the many other craft with the same or a similar name, including in particular at least four other vessels named Columbia which ran on the Columbia river or its tributaries.  Owners  Columbia was built at upper Astoria, Oregon. One source states that the vessel was built by Gen. James Adair (1808–1888) and James Frost.Corning, Willamette Landings, at 23-24. John Adair was the first collector of customs for the Oregon Territory.Horner, Oregon: Her History, at 148. Adair was a lawyer with political connections, and later was friend and advisor to Joseph Lane, one of Oregon's first senators.Hines, Illustrated History of the State of Oregon, at 657. Frost, originally from Missouri, had come out to Oregon with a pioneer rifle regiment.Bancroft, History of Oregon 1848-1888, at 255-56 He had been a sutler in this regiment, and his brother was quartermaster. When the American Civil War began, he returned to Missouri, where he served with the rebel militia. He lived in St. Louis, Missouri after the war. Another source states that Columbia was built by Thomas Goodwin and George Hewitt for Adair, Frost, and two others, whose names are given as Leonards and Green.  Design  Columbia has been described as odd-shaped and clumsy-looking, and double-ended like a ferry. The vessel was built of wood and powered by sidewheels, which were driven by engines which originally came from France. James Frost had journeyed to San Francisco to purchase the engines, which were shipped up to Astoria. Another source states that the chief engineer, Thomas V. Smith, went to San Francisco to purchase engines.  First trip upriver  Columbia began its first trip up the Columbia on the morning of July 3, 1850, with James Frost acting as captain. No one on board knew where the channel was, and the steamer's progress was slow. To act as pilots, Frost hired two young people of the Coast Salish who had been fishing on the river. By the end of the first day, they had travelled fifty miles, and Frost, not wanting to risk the vessel in the dark, tied up to the riverbank. The next morning, July 4, 1850, the steamer cast off again and proceeded upstream, arriving at Portland, Oregon (then only a small settlement) at 3:00 p.m. After staying at Portland for abouttwo hours, Columbia then proceeded on to Oregon City, arriving there at 8:00 p.m., where there was a celebration of the vessel's arrival. It had taken 26 hours to make the trip.  Later operations  After a second trip to Oregon City, Columbia began to run regular trips between Oregon City and Astoria, connecting with the ocean steamer coming up from San Francisco that was owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Columbia was \\"no floating palace\\". Fares were $25 per person either way, with passengers to furnish their own food, which would be eaten from baskets or on blankets spread out on the deck or a table in the small cabin. Space was allocated for sleeping at night on the deck, for which there was no additional charge. Often there was standing room only on the boat. Once gold strikes began in the west, fares could be paid in gold. One early passenger, John McCracken, reported that he once paid two ounces of gold dust for travel on the Columbia from Astoria to Portland. He had to sleep on the upper deck, the vessel was crowded, and the trip took two days. The boat did not run at night. Columbia completed with the keelboats, bateaux and sailing vessels that had provided the transport on the river, by towing barges, transporting immigrants who had reached the Cascade Rapids and general steamboat work. For six months Columbia was the only steamboat on the river, until the Lot Whitcomb was launched on December 25, 1850. Lot Whitcomb was a vessel far superior to Columbia. The owners of Columbia dropped their fare to $15. According to one source, Mills, the backers of Lot Whitcomb refused to meet this, believing, correctly, that people would pay more to ride their superior steamer. Another source, Corning, states that Lot Whitcomb forced the Columbias fare down to $12.  Disposition  By December 1853, Fashion was running with Columbias engines, as this advertisement shows. The sources disagree as to the disposition of the vessel. Corning states that by June 1856, Columbia had made over 100 runs to Portland, and earned over $500,000 for her owners. Mills gives 1852 as the year in which the vessel was dismantled, as does the Lewis and Dryden Marine History.Wright, ed., Lewis and Dryden Marine History, at 28-29, and 38. Sources agree, however, that the engines of Columbia were installed in the sidewheeler Fashion, which was built in 1853. After the engines had been removed, Columbias hull was swept downstream and lost during a spring freshlet.

Around 1177–78 AD (VS 1234), a major group migrated to Kutch from Saurashtra under the leadership of Patel Ganga Maru. They settled in the village of Dhaneti.Kumar Ganti Itihass (History of Kumar Gnati) Published in year 1896. There are several Parias of the community, located near village pond of Dhaneti, standing as memorials of the war that was fought in 1178 AD. The community members still go once every year to offer pooja and their respects to their fore-fathers. This group, later, made their distinct identity not only by building historical forts, palaces, temples and architects not only in Kutch but also all over British India, primarily in the fields of railways and coal mining. The Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas left Dhaneti and went on to establish eighteen villages in Kutch which were granted to them by the King: Anjar, Sinugra, Khambhra, Nagalpar, Khedoi, Madhapar, Hajapar, Kukma, Galpadar, Reha, Vidi, Jambudi, Devaliya, Lovaria, Nagor, Meghpar, Chandiya and Kumbharia. Over the centuries, they have been known or identified by some other names like Kadias, Kadia Kshatriyas and Kumar Gnati. Culture They are a Hindu community. Some are followers of Swaminarayan and Pranami sect of Hinduism, They are vegetarian in diet and avoid consumption of alcohol. The staple food is khichdi, vegetables, pulses and butter-milk. The community consists of clans like Rathod, Chauhan, Yadav, Chawda, Jethwa, Padhiar, Yadav, Chudasama, Parmar, Taunk, Khodiyar, Solanki, Sawaria, Vaghela, Vegad, Varu, Maru, Bhalsod, etc., who enjoy same status. However, most of people prefer to pre-fix Mistri to their name. The community are an endogamous community who practice the principle of clan exogamy. Dowry is generally not asked for, neither practice of bride price is there in community. Divorce is generally not encouraged; however, divorce can be claimed in certain cases. Betrothal ceremony generally precedes marriage, which is held usually within one year of engagement and marriage is observed as per Hindu rites by taking seven circumambulation of fire. Widow remarriage (ghargenu) is allowed, where the women is usually married outside husband's family. In Kutch A Chabutro built by Seth Khora Ramji Chawda in year 1900 standing at village Sinugra, shows the unique architect and skill of Mistris of Kutch. The Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas were master craftsmen, architects and contractors and have played a major role in erection and construction of the majority of forts, palaces and architecture of Kutch. It was because of this they came to be known as Mistri in Kutch. Indian railways It was during 1850 to 1930 AD that the KGK migrated outside Kutch and were involved in the construction of major rail-bridges and the laying down of railway tracks in almost all major rail routes of undivided British India doing the \\"Railway Thekedari\\" (Railway Contractors also Thikadari) and as Thekedar (or Thikadar) in Irrigation projects and Forest Department and Public Works Department. They have also done major roadway, road bridges, canal works, irrigation dams and barrage work throughout British India from 1850 to 1980. The communities largest contribution is in the building of the early railway lines and bridges throughout British India. Their works in Railway construction span from 1850 to 1980 for more than one and a quarter of century. Docks, dams and canals in British India The KGK contributed to the building of docks, dams, barrages and irrigation canals between 1850 and 1980, and they in the eighteenth century had been among the communities who built the first ports of Bombay and Hornby Vellard. Other docks were developed in Bombay during 1870–1895 (Prince's Docks built in 1885 and Victoria Docks built in 1891) in which many Mistris of Kutch and Kadia Kshatriyas of Saurashtra worked. The Mandavi Docks, bridge over Rukhmavati at Mandavi and many road bridges across territories of British India are built by the community using their mason's skills. Mining In the regions of British India known as Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, the Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas pioneered Indian involvement in coal mining from 1894. They broke the previous monopolies held by British and other Europeans, establishing many collieries at l Jharia coalfields and Ranigunj coalfield.Diary of Golden Days at Jharia – A Memoir and History of Gurjar Kashtriya community of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia – written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa of Calcutta (1998).

The hacienda spans 11 barangays in three towns of Tarlac province. Most of the original farmworkers reside in 10 villages – Barangays Balete, Cutcut (or Sta. Catalina), Lourdes (formerly Texas), Mapalacsiao (formerly Luisita), Asturias, and Bantog in Tarlac City; Barangay Motrico in La Paz town; and Barangays Parang (formerly San Sebastian), Mabilog (formerly Pasajes) and Pando in Concepcion town. The original estate includes the Central Azucarera de Tarlac (CAT) sugar mill and a golf course. The eleventh village is Barangay Central in Tarlac City which houses the CAT sugar mill, the St. Martin de Porres Hospital and the Our Lady of Lourdes Church. It features Luisita Golf and Country Club, a golf course and Las Haciendas de Luisita Subdivision, a 5-interconnected luxury subdivision. Originally owned by the Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas, it is now owned by the Cojuangco family who acquired the hacienda in the late 1950s. The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of Hacienda Luisita's stock shares, are Pedro Cojuangco, Josephine C. Reyes's heirs, Teresita C. Lopa's heirs, José Cojuangco, Jr., and María Paz C. Teopaco, all siblings of the late former President Corazón C. Aquino who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and the Daughters of Charity and other non-profit organizations. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's stock distribution option scheme. History  Spanish era  Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas Historical Marker Hacienda Luisita was once part of the holdings of Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas, Sociedad Anónima, better known as Tabacalera. The land was owned by Spain, by virtue of the country's colonial relationship to the Philippines. The tobacco company was founded on 26 November 1881 by the Spaniard Antonio López y López from Comillas, Cantabria and Santiago de Cuba, and Don Guillermo Rubio born in Santander, Cantabria. In 1780, the popularity of cigars in the Philippines prompted Spanish authorities to impose a tobacco monopoly, such that the only ones able to plant, manufacture, and sell cigars were the colonial government. Tabacalera was a private enterprise Lopez y Lopez founded with the sole intention of taking over the Philippine tobacco monopoly from the Spanish colonial government; the monopoly was abolished a year after Lopez y Lopez acquired the estate. This included the Hacienda Antonio (named after his eldest son), Hacienda San Fernando and Hacienda Isabel (named after his eldest daughter) in Cagayán and Isabela provinces where the La Flor de Isabela cigar was cultivated. Due to the high profits of sugar and tobacco in the Philippines, Antonio López y López and his son, Claudio López Bru, the second to hold the title, donated some of the profits to the Jesuits to create the Pontifical University of Comillas, a university outside Madrid.  American period  Factory laborers quarters, with cane areas of Hacienda Luisita in background, 1929 During the American period, the hacienda supplied almost 20% of America's sugar from 1898 to the 1940s (from the Spanish–American War until World War II) back when the Tabacalera still owned it. Because of this, the Luisita sugar became popular locally as well. The Spanish-owned hacienda flourished mainly because of America's obsession with sugar. In the 1920s, Tabacalera then left the tobacco business to focus on the growing sugar industry to cater to US’ needs since this product was more profitable at the time. They invested heavily on the business by constructing a sugar refinery known as \\"Central Azcurarera de Tarlac\\" (CAT) which used America's centrifugal machinery technology in order to double the production and lessen the cost of shipping sugar to a refinery in Laguna owned by the Roxas Family. The refinery became the largest sugar central in the Philippines thus increasing Tabacalera's profits. With a new production line, the refinery required a new system for more efficiency. Workers were laid off or forced to retire since old farm workers were not familiar with the new technology. This then resulted to continuous protests for a year. The Hacienda produced 126,129 tons of sugar in 1928 as well as allegedly receiving additional tons of sugar with current prices of Php 23,450. The workers then found out that the hacienda was receiving multiple fines that were deducted from the workers’ wages, which sparked outrage.  Japanese occupation of the Philippines  During the Japanese period, the Hacienda still continued all operations in sugar production. A Japanese policy was put in place to ensure that supplies in commodities such as rice and sugar were not interrupted and were made available to Filipinos in order to avoid insurgencies or rebellions. The continuation of the production both served the Japanese and the Spanish's interests at that time. In 1942, Luis Taruc and 200 members formed HUKBALAHAP, a peasant based guerrilla army to fight the Japanese forces. Many of these members were farmers of Hacienda Luisita because of their discontent with Tabacalera, advocating for the distribution of land. On 25 January 1945, General Douglas Macarthur set up his headquarters at Hacienda Luisista to fight Japanese forces in the Philippines. In 1947, a farmer's wife was reported to be raped by one of the remaining Spanish directors of the hacienda. In support of her, other wives lay themselves on the railroad tracks to stop the trains carrying sugar from being delivered. The Spanish director immediately left for Spain which pushed the Huks to execute Spanish \\"encargados\\" or managers in front of the guest house when they refused to admit to the crime.  José Cojuangco period (1957-1976)  The Tarlac Training Center, along Hacienda Luisita Road (San Miguel, Capehan, Balite, Lourdes, Central and Mapalacsiao, Tarlac City). In 1957, the owners of the Tabacalera decided to sell Hacienda Luisita as well as the sugar mill, Central Azcurarera de Tarlac (CAT), because of the HUKBALAHAP rebels who were causing them problems. The CAT was supposed to be sold to the Lopez family of Iloilo but then the purchase was vetoed by President Ramon Magsaysay due to the clan owning multiple businesses such as Meralco, ABS-CBN, the Manila Chronicle, Negros Navigation, as well as a number of substantial agricultural holdings, which the president deemed to problematic because the Lopez's were becoming too powerful. President Magsaysay then offered the Central Azcurarera de Tarlac to Jose Cojuangco Sr. through Ninoy Aquino Jr (Jose's son-in-law) in early 1957. Ninoy Aquino was Magsaysay's political prodigy and personal assistant at that time, which helped the Cojuangcos in purchasing the CAT. As agreed upon, the hacienda would be paid for in pesos, while the CAT would be paid for in US dollars. The Philippine government aided the Cojuangcos in obtaining the loans needed to pay the price. In 1957, the clan took control of the CAT and the hacienda through Manufacturer's Trust Co New York. endorsed by the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as well as Government System Insurance Service (GSIS). The BSP then approved the loan in August 1957 under two conditions, one of which states that the CAT be bought together with Hacienda Luisita and that the hacienda shall be distributed to farmers under the Magsaysay's social justice program. The government then authorized a P 5.9 million loan from GSIS which was approved in November 1957. The Cojuangcos were given a ten-year window to distribute the lands to farmers as stipulated. Finally on 1958, Jose Cojuangco Sr.’s Tarlac Development Corporation (TADECO) became the new owner of Hacienda Luisita as well as the CAT. Ninoy Aquino then became Luisita’s first administrator.  Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos (1965-1986)  The year 1967 marked the end of the 10-year window given to the Cojuangcos that the Philippine government gave in order to distribute the land. However, the Cojuangcos failed to distribute any land. In response, farmers’ organizations began to form in order to push for the distribution.This was combined with political unrest in the nation. The United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) was created because of this. This year was also when Benigno Aquino Jr. was elected senator. Nationwide Martial Law was declared on 21 September 1972, and Benigno Aquino Jr., the son-in-law of Jose \\"Pepe\\" Cojuangco, was among the first to be imprisoned for treason, murder, subversion and weapons possession. During this time, the Marcos administration took an interest in enforcing land reform. Jose Cojuangco died on 21 August 1976, five years from the day of the Plaza Miranda bombing. On 7 May 1980, the government filed a case against Tarlac Development Corporation, or TADECO (a Cojuangco company) before the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC). The case (Republic of the Philippines vs. TADECO, Civil Case No. 131654, Manila Regional Trial Court, Branch XLIII) sought the surrender of the hacienda to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform in order to properly distribute the land to the qualified farm workers. The Cojuangcos responded to the case saying that there were no such tenants or farm workers qualified to receive such land. This was during the same time that Ninoy Aquino and his family were to leave for exile in the United States. At the time, the anti-Marcos block portrayed this lawsuit as an attack on the Aquino family by the Marcoses, while the farmers viewed it as the government taking action to help them. Ninoy Aquino was shot on 21 August 1983, as he was descending the plane. On 2 December 1985, the Manila RTC ordered TADECO to surrender Hacienda Luisita to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR, now the Department of Agrarian Reform, or DAR) due to noncompliance of the land reform act. TADECO alleged that the hacienda housed no tenants, and that the hacienda's sugar lands are not covered by existing agrarian reform legislations. The Cojuangcos brought the case to the Court of Appeals due to their belief that the case was an act of harassment by the Marcos administration because Corazon Aquino took her late husband's place to run against Marcos in the 1986 snap elections. Of note is that land reform was one of the issues her campaign focused on. The snap elections were fraught with anti-Marcos allegations, and led to the People Power Revolution.  Presidency of Corazón “Cory” C. Aquino (1986-1992)  Despite the installation of Corazon Aquino as president, the farmland was not being distributed. Thousands of farmers marched to Malacañang Palace on 22 January 1987. 13 protesting farmers were shot in what is now known as the \\"Mendiola Massacre.\\" On 22 July 1987, Aquino issues Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order No. 229, which outlines her agrarian reform program. On 18 May 1988, the case the Marcos administration filed against TADECO was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, and the Philippine government, under the Aquino administration, moved to dismiss its own case. On 10 June 1988, the Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) is signed into law by President Aquino. The law includes a Stock Distribution Option (SDO) which would allow landowners to distribute the stock shares of the land to the farmers, instead of actual land. In compliance with the CARP, 4915.75 hectares of Hacienda Luisita were folded into Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) on 23 August 1988, in order to comply with a stock distribution agreement between the landowners and farm workers. The hacienda's farmers voted 92.9% in favor of the SDO route with regards to the land reform act. This agreement was implemented on 11 May 1989. The farm workers' therefore now owned 33% of the plantation, while the Cojuangcos retained ownership of the remaining 67% of stocks. In accordance with the SDO agreement, there would be a 30-year schedule for distributing and transferring the stocks to the farmers.  Present period (1992-onwards)  On 1 September 1995, 3,290 hectares of the hacienda was reclassified from agricultural to commercial, industrial, and residential land. This was passed by the Provincial Board of Tarlac, the governor of which was Margarita \\"Tingting\\" Cojuangco, wife of Jose \\"Peping\\" Cojuangco, Jr., brother of Cory Aquino. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) approved the conversion of 500 hectares in 1996. In 2003, hacienda workers filed a petition to have the SDO agreement revoked, and in 2005, the DAR cancelled the stock distribution agreement. It was cited that the SDO had failed to improve the lives of the more than 5,000 farmer beneficiaries. HLI appealed this decision, but in May 2006, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council rejected with finality the motion of HLI to reconsider the revocation of the stock distribution agreement. However, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order, stopping the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council from parceling out the land to the workers.  Criticisms of ownership  The Cojuangcos have often garnered criticism for their ownership of the estate with some critics comparing the situation to problems seen in oligarchy based systems.Doronila, Amando (14 September 2009). \\"Aquino meets estate issue head- on\\". Philippine Daily Inquirer. Archived from the original on 16 September 2009. Retrieved 2 November 2009 The estate's incorporators, who control 70 percent of the stock shares of the Hacienda, are Pedro Cojuangco, the children of Josephine C. Reyes, the heirs of Teresita C. Lopa, José Cojuangco, Jr., and María Paz C. Teopaco—all of whom were siblings of the late former President Corazón C. Aquino who, on the day she became President of the Philippines, bequeathed her shares to her children and non-profit organizations such as the Daughters of Charity for fear that it would be used as political propaganda. The remaining 30 percent of the stock shares was given to farm workers under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program's Stock Distribution Option scheme.  Current Issues and Problems   Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP)  The signing into law of Republic Act No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) on 10 June 1988 signaled the beginning of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under former President Corazon Aquino. One of the clauses of the CARP provided for a Stock Distribution Option (SDO), which would allow for compliance with the agrarian reform law by distributing stocks of the hacienda to the farm workers rather than actual land.. On 9 May 1989, a referendum was held among the farm workers of Hacienda Luisita to determine whether stocks or land would be the means by which the hacienda would be distributed. The results of the May 1989 referendum, as well as a second referendum held in October of the same year, found that a great majority of the Hacienda farm workers voted in favor of distribution of stock rather than land. The terms of the SDO agreement of the Hacienda are quoted as follows: > “At the end of each fiscal year, for a period of 30 years, the SECOND PARTY > (HLI) shall arrange with the FIRST PARTY (TADECO) the acquisition and > distribution to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers) on the basis of number of > days worked and at no cost to them of one-thirtieth (1/30) of 118,391,976.85 > shares of the capital stock of the SECOND PARTY (HLI) that are presently > owned and held by the FIRST PARTY (TADECO), until such time as the entire > block of 118,391,976.85 shares shall have been completely acquired and > distributed to the THIRD PARTY (farm workers).\\" The SDO agreement however was met with considerable criticism, most notably in 2003 when hacienda workers (farmers, HLI supervisory group workers, union officers) began filing petitions to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to have the SDO agreement revoked due to their dividends and other promised benefits not being given. Daily wage was at P194.50, and there was only one working day per week, due to the mechanizing of some tasks in the hacienda. A petition with more than 5,300 signatures was filed to revoke the SDO agreement and stop land conversion in the hacienda. In 2004, the workers' union tried to negotiate with the management to increase daily wages to P225 and increase work days to 2–3 days weekly. Management refused. In 1 October of that year, 327 workers (farm workers and union officers) were retrenched.  Land reform disputes  = November 2004 Massacre = On 6 November 2004, United Luisita Workers Union (ULWU) and the Central Azucarera de Tarlac Labor Union (CATLU) launched a strike near Gate 1 of the Central Azucarera de Tarlac sugar mill. The protesters were pushing for an increase in their P9.50 weekly wage, increased worker benefits and, more broadly, a greater commitment for national land reform. Over a thousand farmers, and another several thousand union members attended the demonstration. On 16 November 2004, ten days after the start of the said strike, police and soldiers were dispatched by then Labour Secretary Patricia Santo Tomás, to storm and disperse the blockade. The enforcers utilized tear gas, water cannons, guns, and military vehicles to disseminate the crowd. Seven of the people participating in the rally were killed, an estimated number of 121 people, adults and children, were injured, and 133 people were arrested and detained. The incident has sparked a national outcry, however, then Deputy Speaker Benigno ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III, Representative of Tarlac, claims that the dispersal done by the enforcers was justified. A case was filed against the police and military with regards to the injuries and deaths, however it was dismissed by the office of the Ombudsman in 2010. Proceeding that, a motion to reopen the case was filed by the families of the victims, however, it was declined by the Office of the Ombudsman on 2 October 2014. The November 2004 massacre or more popularly known as the Hacienda Luisita massacre is one of the most prominent instances of protest related deaths of Filipinos in recent years. In the months following the Hacienda Luisita massacre, eight more people who either supported or provided evidence to the farmers’ cause were found murdered, beginning with the assassination of peasant leader Marcelino Beltran just before he was to testify about the massacre. = Revocation of the Stock Distribution Option Agreement = In the aftermath of the November 2004 massacre, the DAR established Task Force Luisita to conduct further investigations and conduct focus group discussions among the farmers. On 22 September 2005, based on the findings of its investigations, Task Force Luisita recommended the revocation of the SDO agreement forged between Hacienda Luisita Inc. (HLI) and the farm workers. Three months later, on December of the same year, the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) issued a resolution ordering the revocation of the SDO agreement and the distribution of the hacienda's land among the farm workers. Land distribution and the cancellation of the SDO agreement was halted however in June 2006 when the Supreme Court granted the petition of HLI and issued a temporary restraining order on the PARC resolution. On 18 August 2010, oral arguments on the Hacienda Luisita case were heard by the Supreme Court for the first time since the dispute was brought to its doors in 2006. A landmark decision was ultimately reached on 5 July 2011, wherein the Supreme Court lifted the temporary restraining order on the 2005 PARC resolution and upheld both the distribution of land to the hacienda's farm workers and the revocation of the SDO agreement forged in 1989. In acknowledgement of the fact that 93% of the hacienda's farm workers voted in favor of SDO in the 1989 referendum, included in the July 2011 decision was the further mandating of the DAR to hold another referendum to determine which among the hacienda's farm workers would wish to receive land or to remain as stockholders of HLI. This decision to hold another referendum was met with considerable criticism however as critics asserted that agrarian reform laws stipulate that land distribution should be the only viable option and alternatives such as the SDO violate this. On 22 November 2011, the Supreme Court modified its July 2011 decision and revoked the option for the hacienda farm workers to remain as stockholders of HLI, stating: > “Upon a review of the facts and circumstances, We realize that the FWBs > [Farmer-Worker Beneficiaries] will never have control over these > agricultural lands for as long as they remain as stockholders of HLI… In > line with Our finding that control over agricultural lands must always be in > the hands of the farmers, We reconsider our ruling that the qualified FWBs > should be given an option to remain as stockholders of HLI, inasmuch as > these qualified FWBs will never gain control given the present proportion of > shareholdings in HLI.” = Disputes over Landowner Compensation = In compliance with agrarian reform laws, the Supreme Court decisions further stated that HLI was entitled to payment by the government as just compensation for distributing the hacienda's lands to the farm workers. The corporation was to receive compensation for the distributed land based on its valuation on the date of its taking from HLI. In line with this, HLI presented 2 January 2006 as the appropriate date of taking based on when a Notice of Coverage was issued by the DAR placing the hacienda's land under compulsory acquisition. However the Supreme Court maintained its initial stance that the date of taking be marked at 21 November 1989, based on when the original stock distribution plan was approved, stating this was when ownership of the lands was initially relinquished to make way for its distribution to the farm workers via stock. Under the 2006 valuation of the distributed land, the compensation payment would have amounted to about P5 billion while under the 1989 valuation of the distributed land, the compensation would total only about P200 million. = April 2012 Supreme Court Ruling = On 24 April 2012, the Supreme Court released a final and executory decision regarding Hacienda Luisita: > \\"To recapitulate, the Court voted on the following issues in this manner: > 1\\\\. In determining the date of taking, the Court voted 8-6 to maintain the > ruling fixing November 21, 1989 as the date of taking, the value of the > affected lands to be determined by the LBP and the DAR; 2\\\\.

SO > ORDERED.\\"  Current status  The Supreme Court ruling states that the 4,916 hectares of Hacienda Luisita is to be redistributed to 6,296 registered farm-worker beneficiaries, while the Hacienda Luisita Incorporated (HLI) will be receiving 40,000 pesos per hectare as compensation. This is based on the 1989 valuation of the Hacienda Luisita that the Supreme Court had voted upon. But from the 4,916 hectares to be redistributed, 500 hectares were converted into non- agricultural use on 18 August 1996 by the Department of Agrarian Reform, while 80.5 hectares was also subtracted for the development of the Subic Clark Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). Other inconsistencies within area size have caused conflicting numbers, but according to the DAR this then leaves only 4,099.92 hectares of land to be distributed. The process of land distribution was decided to be through lottery system, wherein the names of the beneficiaries are placed into a drum, and those chosen will be given the Lot Allocation Certificate (LAC). Farmer-worker Beneficiaries then sign the Application to Purchase and Farmers' Undertaking (APFU), for the registry of their Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA), which is the actual land title. The lottery system had started on 18 July 2013 in Barangay Cutcut, Tarlac City with 340 farmers being given the first batch of Lot Allocation Certificates. But it was on 30 September 2013, where DAR Secretary Virgilio de los Reyes started awarding the actual Certificate of Land Ownership (CLOA) to 600 Farmer-worker beneficiaries in Barangay Pando. As of 12 July 2016, 4,099 hectares have been already distributed to farmers, but the sales shares from the Hacienda Luisita's converted land to be paid to the farmer-worker beneficiaries have been left unpaid which amounts to 1.3 billion pesos. On 24 April 2017, protesters consisting of the Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) and other militant organizations had gone to Hacienda Luisita to protest against the 348 hectare land that was turned over to Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) back on 25 November 2004 for a 431.7 million peso loan obligation. The protest led to property damage, where protesters had destroyed over 100 meters of a wall surrounding the contested lot. On 21 February 2018, Luisita Land Corporation has since filed a case against 15 farmers for the protest, for malicious mischief and trespassing of the RCBC owned land. As of 4 July 2018, the Hacienda Luisita has fully complied with distributing the sales shares to farmers. The 1.3 billion peso was broken down as such: P500 million received from Luisita Realty Inc. for a 200 hectare lot sold in 1996, P750 million for the selling of Luisita Industrial Park, and around P80 million for the 80.51 hectares used for the SCTEX road network. The ruling also states that 3% of the earlier stock transfers that were paid to the farmers will be deducted from the 1.3 billion to be received.

Further, they share common practices on procedures, science, Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), validation, quality (GLP) and discuss new developments in industry. History The EBF was founded in the fall of 2006 at the initiative of twelve pharmaceutical companies, all of them having bioanalytical laboratory activities in Europe. The goal of bringing these companies together was to implement a platform for discussions of science and regulatory issues. Views and recommendations following from these discussions are either published in scientific journals, like for example on the controversial and much debated topic of incurred sample reproducibility or presented at international meetings. As of May 2010 the EBF consists of 28 member companies. Meetings The EBF intends to stimulate further harmonization of industry practices in bioanalysis, to bring a common understanding of the interpretation of regulatory issues and more clarity to the implementation of procedures in order to achieve best practices in the world of bioanalysis. The forum currently hosts two types of meetings: Closed meetings Twice a year the EBF brings together representatives all member companies to discuss subjects well prepared in advance. The topics range from procedural to regulatory often resulting in internal benchmarking or surveys. Next to these 'general' meetings, topic specific specialists meetings are also organized. All member companies assign one representative to these closed meetings. Open meetings The EBF organizes annual symposia to involve the bioanalytical community: pharmaceutical industry, academia, CRO, instrument providers and regulatory agencies. It is the intention of the organisation to inform their business partners and peers about the discussion held and agreements achieved and to open the forum for challenging procedures or techniques as well as for new regulatory requirements. The EBF has also reached out to participate in international scientific meetings representing the bioanalytical voice of the European pharmaceutical industry. Selective examples are: American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists meetings, The Boston Society Applied Pharmaceutical Analysis meetings, and Canadian Validation Group meeting. Organisation Steering Committee The organization is led by a steering committee elected from its members. The steering committee represents the EBF in international forums and sets the agenda for the closed and open meetings. Interest groups An Interest Group Macromolecules (EBF-IGM) was founded in 2008 to provide a platform for scientific exchange and harmonization of specific aspects for the bioanalysis of macromolecules: drugs and biomarkers as well as immunogenicity testing.

It is known from a mandibular ramus that was first described as Brachydectes minor by Richard Owen in 1879. Because the generic name Brachydectes was preoccupied by the Carboniferous amphibian Brachydectes, the species was reassigned to the new genus Oweniasuchus by Arthur Smith Woodward in 1885, along with another species, B. minor, also described by Owen from material from Beccles. Recently, O. major has been considered a nomen dubium because the holotype specimen (BMNH 48304) is too fragmentary to provide an adequate diagnosis.

It marked the terminus of the Acqua Felice aqueduct restored by Pope Sixtus V. It was designed by Domenico Fontana and built in 1585-88.Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli, Fountains as Refreshment\\" in Fountains, Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present. pg. 36.  History  At the beginning the reign of Pope Sixtus V (born Felice Peretti) in 1585, only one of the ancient Roman aqueducts which brought water to the city, the Aqua Vergine, was still being maintained and working. Everyone in Rome who wanted clean drinking water had to go to the single fountain near the site of today's Trevi Fountain. Pope Sixtus took on the responsibility of restoring other aqueducts, including the Acqua Alessandrina, which he renamed Acqua Felice after himself.Felice in Italian translates to happy or contented. The new fountain that marked the terminus of the restored aqueduct was the first new monumental wall fountain in Rome since antiquity.Marilyn Symmes, pg. 35 The initial effort to build the aqueduct, by architect Matteo Bartolini, was a failure: Bartolini miscalculated the incline of the channel, so the flow of water was much less than needed reach the Quirinal Hill, the intended site of its terminal fountain.K.W. Rinne, The Waters of Rome 2010, pg. 126 Giovanni Fontana took over the building of the aqueduct, which was completed by June 1587. A fountain was constructed by architect engineer Domenico Fontana in the form of an ancient Roman triumphal arch. It featured, as ancient Roman fountains did, an inscription honoring its builder, Pope Sixtus, beneath angels holding the papal coat of arms. The iconography of the sculptures beneath the arches mingles a biblical and political motifs. The central arch featured a large statue of Moses, made in 1588 by Leonardo Sormani and Prospero da Brescia. The pope, as both religious and political ruler of the papal states, would have felt an affinity to Moses. The left bas-relief panel, sometimes referred to as a depiction of Aaron, and sculpted by Giovanni Battista della Porta,Accurata, E Succinta Descrizione Topografica, E Istorica Di Roma, Volume 1; by Ridolfino Venuti; Presso Carlo Barbellieni, Rome (1766); page 73. may instead reflect either the miracles by Moses at Marah, where Moses removed the bitterness of the barely potable water of a spring in Sinai, or more likely the miracle at Masah and Meribah, where he struck the rock to cause water to flow (Exodus 17:5-7). Again, the pope would have wanted his achievement of bringing water to Rome to be compared to that of Moses. Finally, the bas-relief to the right sculpted by Flaminio Vacca and Pietro Paolo Olivieri, has been depicted as Joshua, but others claim the relief references Gideon in Judges 7:5, as evidenced by soldier's gear and animals lapping water.So Gideon brought the people down to the water, and the LORD said to him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel to drink.\\"Rome et ses environs, Volume 1, by Abbe Andre Manazzale, Chez Cajetan Cambiagi, Florence (1793); page 81.Venuti, page 73. Alternatively, given the Roman attire of the soldiers, it may reflect the founding of the ancient Roman Acqua Alessandrina by emperor Septimus Severus; the imagery would lead to having the feat of the aqueduct being compared to the achievements of ancient Rome, or as an example of the restoration of the former glory of the city. Water flows from the statues into basins, where four lions, originally Ancient Egyptian sculptures, but now copies, once were part of a monumental fountain dedicated to Marcus Agrippa in front of the Roman Pantheon, are spouting water. The columns flanking the arches are also said to have derived from that structure.Il Panteon e le Terme d'Agrippa in Nuova Antologia di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, article by R Lanciani, Rome (1882); page 635. Fontana dell'Acqua Felice, statue of Moses The statue of Moses was criticized at the time for its large size, not in proportion with the other statuary, but the fountain achieved its political purpose; it was a statement of how the Catholic Church, unlike the Protestant Reformation, was serving the needs of the people of Rome. It also achieved its social purpose of reviving the Quirinal neighborhood; what had been a rustic area of villas was turned into a thriving urban neighborhood by the arrival of a good drinking water supply.Marilyn Symmes, pg. 36  References   Bibliography  * Marilyn Symmes, (editor), Fountains, Splash and Spectacle - Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present.

The company is based in Lake Elsinore, California and was founded in 1997 by John Suhr, who \\"has a reputation for building exquisitely crafted guitars\\" and Steve Smith.  History  Prior to founding JS Technologies Inc, John Suhr had worked at Rudy's Music Stop in New York City doing guitar repair. He started building guitars in 1974, and he created the first Suhr Custom guitar in 1984. Teaming up with Rudy Pensa they started selling guitars under the Pensa-Suhr brand, and the signature model they built for former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler is perhaps their most famous guitar. A tobacco sunburst Suhr Classic from the late 1990s with a maple neck and EMG pickups. Around 1991, Suhr moved from NYC to Los Angeles to work with guitar rig builder Bob Bradshaw. Before leaving NYC they had collaborated on the design of a preamplifier, the Custom Audio Electronics (CAE) 3+, used for instance by Steve Lukather. They also designed a 100 watt amplifier head, the Custom Audio Amplifiers (CAA) OD-100. During this period 1991-1994, John Suhr built about 50 custom guitars and focused mainly on building amplifiers. Guitars from this period are more rare than guitars from the Pensa-Suhr era and can be identified by the 'built for\\" information handwritten by Suhr in the neck socket. From 1995 to 1997, John Suhr worked as Senior Master Builder at Fender's Custom Shop. In 1997 Suhr left Fender to form his own company with Steve Smith. Suhr had the knowledge about building guitars, Smith knew about management, software and CNC programming. Combining their efforts, they had total control of the manufacturing process and used the CNC routers to efficiently produce guitar necks and bodies, rather than doing it completely by hand. In the 1990s Suhr also made a name for himself making pickups, such as the custom-made single coils for Scott Henderson (Bill Frisell also uses Suhr pickups). During their first years the company built high-end guitars to customer specifications, introducing a new model about once a year. In 2004 they expanded into guitar amplifiers when they re-introduced the CAA OD-100, which had earlier only been available in very limited numbers. In addition to the OD-100, which still bears the Custom Audio Amplifiers brand, they now also manufacture the Badger line of amplifiers bearing the Suhr name. 2005 saw the introduction of the Silent Single Coil system, which uses a secondary coil for noise cancellation to enable guitars with single coil pickups to function without picking up noise. Later years have also seen introduction of various other electronic accessories like single-coil, humbucker and electric bass pickups, mixers, and now also effect pedals. This included a collaboration with Doug Aldrich to create high-output humbucking pickups for an aggressive rock style of playing. In addition to receiving attention for their instruments, the company has also received some attention for their usage of modern technology in the design and manufacturing process in what might be regarded as a hand-craft niche of the guitar industry. At the 2010 winter NAMM show, the company introduced a new line of guitars with a new brand, Rasmus Guitars. These guitars were manufactured in Asia but had the final setup performed at the Suhr factory in Lake Elsinore, California. Moving production to Asia enabled the company to lower costs, and these guitars were therefore priced a tier below the Suhr Pro line. The Rasmus line was discontinued in 2012 with the introduction of the Modern Satin series, fully made in Lake Elsinore but with a simple and standardized finish. The Modern Satin initially had ordinary nickel frets, receiving jumbo stainless steel frets since April 2013.  Products   Electric guitars  Their guitar models are based on the below mentioned five distinct body shapes, and different series are available. All guitars are built to customer specifications, with the exception of the Pro Series, which are a limited option series of guitars based on the five available body shapes. * Classic (based on Fender Stratocaster) * Classic T (based on Fender Telecaster) * Classic JM (based on Fender Jazzmaster) * Standard (loosely Stratocaster-shaped with additional Superstrat styling including a carve top) * Modern (24-fret Superstrat) * Modern T (24-fret similar to the Modern but with a Telecaster-inspired body) * Aura (based on Gibson Les Paul)  Bass guitars  * Classic J (based on Fender Jazz Bass)  Amplifiers  * Badger 18 * Badger 30 * Badger 35 * OD-100 * PT-100 * SH-100 * ML-100 * SE-100 * SL-67 * SL-68 * Corso * Hedgehog * Bella/Bella Reverb * Jim Kelley Amplifiers  Effects pedals  * Jack Rabbit * Koji Comp * Riot/Riot Reloaded * Shiba Drive/Shiba Drive Reloaded * KokoBoost/KokoBoost Reloaded * Rufus/Rufus Reloaded * Dual Boost * Eclipse * ACE Analog Cabinet Emulator * Alexa Chorus  Artists  Musicians who use/have used Suhr guitars and basses are: * Reb Beach * Scott Henderson * Guthrie Govan (until mid-2012) * Mike Landau * Ian Thornley * Dave Kilminster * Mateus Asato * Pete Thorn *Mark Knopfler Pino Daniele (ita)  References   External links  * Official website * John Suhr Interview on NAMM Oral History Library (2016) Category:Bass guitar manufacturing companies Category:Guitar amplifier manufacturers Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Greater Los Angeles Category:Manufacturing in Riverside County, California Category:Lake Elsinore, California Category:American companies established in 1997 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in California Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Suhr Guitars"},{"id":"24911994","text":"The former Eskimo factory in Athens, 2008 Eskimo was the brand name of home appliances (refrigerators, freezers, kitchen ovens, heaters, TV sets etc.) produced by Viometal Eskimo, a Greek company founded in 1958.

Born in New Zealand in 1942, Lewis attended King's School and King's College, Auckland. He gained a double first in Classics from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and taught at Eton between 1971 and 1980, holding the post of Master in College between 1975 and 1980. He was a distinguished rugby player and cricketer. From 1980 to 1994, Lewis was the Headmaster of Geelong Grammar School in Australia, which had been attended by The Prince of Wales and Rupert Murdoch. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that Geelong Grammar School knew that boarding house assistant Philippe Trutmann, who worked at the school's Highton campus in the 1980s and 1990s, was accused of improper conduct in 1985 and failed to take any action. Phillippe Trutmann was convicted in 2005 of sexually abusing at least 40 male students and sentenced to six-and-a-half years' jail. The Royal Commission Counsel Assisting stated that \\"Mr Lewis' failures to take proper steps to respond to allegations of child sexual abuse and his failure to implement a proper system to deal with allegations of child sexual abuse fell below the standards expected of a principal of a school at the time of his actions.\\" Lewis took up the Headship of Eton College in 1994. Sir Eric Anderson, the previous head master, had led Eton College to second place in the league table of independent schools. Under Lewis, it dropped to 29th place. He supervised the education of Princes William and Harry. Lewis retired in August 2002, having reached his 60th birthday.

Aradi is about away from Bhadrak. The present fifty-foot cement and concrete temple structure replaced a wooden temple some time between 1830-1840 AD. Location & transportation This famous temple, the abode of “Lord Siva” is located in the bank of river Baitarani, at Aradi, to the east of the district headquarters of Bhadrak via Asurali, Kothara and Dhusuri. This place is also linked to Chandabali by boat through the river Baitarani. From Chandabali ferry ghat to Aradi it will take hardly two hours by boat. The temple is just 18 km away from the famous Kali mandir of Rameswarpur village. Legend/History There is no conclusive history available either regarding Baba Akhandalamani or the temple of the lord Siva. According to legend, around 350 years ago during the rule of Raja Sri Niladri Samara Singha Mohapatra, one early morning the Raja sent a peasant to cultivate his paddy field on the bank of the river Baitarani. While cultivating, the blade of his plough was broken by hitting with some hard material. The peasant was astonished and found a black glazed granite stone full of blood flowing toward the river Baitarani. The peasant ran to call King Niladrisamar Singhm and he hurriedly came to the spot, finding a flood of milk in place of blood and a huge black cobra hooding the stone. That night the king had a dream regarding the arrival of the God Akhandalamani on that place. This news spread like wild fire in the locality. The next day King Niladri Samara Singha Mohapatra started worshiping the great god and immediately built a wooden temple on the spot. A large number of devotees from different villages started visiting and worshiping the great God. The king invited five Brahmins from a village named Naharagrama of Jajapur district to perform seva-puja (worshiping and taking care) of lord Akhandalamani. The present main temple of Aradi was built by the King of Konika Shri Harihara Bhanja and his chief queen Satyabhama Patadei. The height of the temple is around 150 ft. All the stones used in this temple were brought from the historic hill of Lalitgiri near Chandikhol. Temple The main hall was built by a sage named Shri Narasingha Pratap Kumar and the surrounding wall of the temple was built by a noted sage named Shri Darshan Sekhara Das. Later, today's Bhoga Mandapa near the temple (along with the present temple office) was built by government initiative. The P.W.D road from Bhadrak to Aradi was declared State Highway and was converted into all-weather road instead of fair-weather road. A Pantha Nivas was built at Aradi by Tourism Dept., Govt. of Odisha. The Govt. of Odisha sanctioned a handsome amount for the temple.Official Website of Baba Akhandalamani There was one reported incidence of theft and burglary at the temple. Festivals There are many fairs and festivals observed at the temple of Baba Akhandalamani like Mahasibaratri which is locally called Jagara mela. On this day pilgrims and devotees inside and outside the state are assembled and worship Akhandalamani at Aradi. Bol bam devotees come to Aradi in large number from different areas in the month of Sravana to worship the God and pour holy water over the Shiva Linga. The Bol bam devotees carry holy water from different rivers of India like Ganges, Baitarani, Mahanadi, Salandi, Peta etc. with a bamboo lever. Controversy In January 2009, the women and child development minister of Odisha was objected by the sevayats for desecrating the temple since she comes from a lower cast.

Advertised as \\"By Black Lightning out of Comet\\" this 500cc single racer is very rare as only 31 were produced. Development Vincents had a close association with motorcycle racing and the Phil Irving designed Vincent Comet provided the basis for the Series C 499cc Grey Flash racer. Tuned and stripped down to as a 500 cc version of the 1,000 cc Vincent Black Lightning, the new 'Flash' was capable of 115 mph with a power output of 35 bhp 6,200 rpm. Prototypes were raced in late 1949 and the last model was produced in 1952. The small numbers produced mean that there was plenty of variation of the specification. Earlier models were finished with chrome on the fuel tank and lower fork link but towards the end of production in 1952 this was replaced by grey paint. As well as the Burman BAR gearbox, Vincent also experimented with AJS 7R gearboxes but used Albion gearboxes for most of the machines produced. Variants The Grey Flash was produced in Racing, Dual Purpose and Road models, as well as Show models and a number of 'TT specials'. Production There is a debate about the number of Vincent Grey Flash motorcycles produced as although the official register lists thirty one, several are known to have been rebuilt. Many surviving Grey Flash motorcycles have been raced and modified to meet changing racing regulations or have been restored using the higher specification of the special show and TT machines for reference, so 'correct' examples are very rare.

He made his first headlines in 1951 when he gave Norton star Geoff Duke a strong challenge in an ACU race at the Thruxton Circuit In 1952 John Surtees set a new lap record on his first outing of the season at Brands Hatch and throughout the early 1950s was virtually unbeatable on his Vincent Grey Flash racer. Museum exhibits The National Motorcycle Museum (UK) has a fully restored Vincent Grey Flash which features a special large-capacity fuel tank designed for the Isle of Man TT, which Vincent contested with four special Grey Flashes in 1950. The Solvang Vintage Motorcycle Museum in Solvang, California also has one of the four 1950 TT Racers which was owned by Ted Davis, Vincent's Chief Engineer. The exhibited bike has an experimental larger valve head and a large aluminium crank pin. Only one of the four Grey Flashes, (ridden by works racer Ken Bills), finished the race in 12th place.

The Bethlehem Municipal Band performs a variety of summer programs in the Bethlehem Rose Garden’s Music in the park series, as well as selected other venues in the surrounding area. History The Bethlehem Municipal Band was founded by Harry B.J. Hertwig and eight fellow musicians. Mr. Hertwig invited the musicians to a meeting to discuss the creation of a band that would be a creative outlet for young area musicians. Mr. Hertwig was looking to enlist recent graduates from Liberty High School who due to graduation were no longer playing with the high school band. Unsuccessful at first, Mr. Hertwig and a few friends contacted civic groups and organizations trying to acquaint them with his idea. Mr Hertwig's perseverance paid off. On May 2, 1935, a group of ten interested musicians met at the home of Joseph Ricapito. Permission to use a room at the yard office of the Brown-Borhek Company was secured and the band's first rehearsal was held there on September 12, 1935. Twenty-four musicians attended this first rehearsal. That September, the band took formal shape with the election of officers. On October 20, 1935, the city council of Bethlehem unanimously agreed to support this new band. This group of thirty- six musicians became known as the \\"Municipal Band of the City of Bethlehem\\". City council also made provisions for use of the 3rd floor of the Municipal building on Market Street for rehearsals. The band swelled to fifty members and made its first public appearance at the President's Ball on January 30, 1936. Four summer concerts were played that year. In June 1937, the band purchased its first uniforms. The band played at the dedication of Illick's Mill Park that year. In 1938, the band made another appearance at the President's Ball. There were ten outdoor and two indoor concerts given by the band that year. Later that year on October 10, 1938, Harry Hertwig resigned from the band. The next ten years from 1939 to 1948, the band played an average of twelve to thirteen concerts a year. In 1939 the band began having annual banquets. World War II had its effect on the band causing the band membership in total to decline, but causing an increase in number of female members. Due to the war, the annual banquet was not held in 1943 or 1944. Between 1949 and 1961, the band played an average of 23 to 24 concerts a year. Beginning in 1962, due to budget cuts, the band was forced to reduce its concerts to 10 per year and playing at the annual fireworks display at Liberty High School. Also due to budget cuts, the annual banquet was cut in 1961. The band first played for the Christmas lighting ceremony in 1940. The band also played at the dedication of Memorial Pool in 1957. In 1959, a sign promoting the band's summer concerts made its debut on the Hill to Hill bridge. In 1972, the band began playing at the annual Christmas city fair. Meeting Places The band has used a number of local sites for rehearsals. The original rehearsal facility was the yard office building of the Brown-Borhek Company. They remained there until 1947, when they moved to Liberty High School. In 1966, rehearsals were moved the Municipal Golf course clubhouse where they stayed until 1977. The years from 1977 to 1981 saw the band move rehearsal sites 5 times from the Boys Club Northeast(1977) to the Naval reserve building on Rodger's Street(1977) to the Sears' Building on East Broad(1978) to the Bethlehem Redevelopment Authority (1979) to the Rosemont Lutheran church on West Broad Street.(1981–1982) to Trinity Lutheran Church on 3rd Avenue where they currently rehearse. In 1960, the city of Bethlehem purchased a mobile band shelter. In 1969, the Municipal band played a concert sponsored by the Seratoma Club of Bethlehem to raise funds to build a permanent band shell. The band shell to be built in the Rose Garden at Eight Avenue in Bethlehem. The famed director, Alburtis Meyers was the guest conductor for that concert. The Band Shell construction was completed in 1982. The Band now plays their summer series of concerts at the Rose Garden band shell. Conductors Over the band's 75-year history they have had 4 directors. Joseph Ricapito, one of the band's founding members, was director for 30 years from 1935 until 1965 when he resigned. Mr. Ricapito died in November 1979. He was succeeded by the assistant band director, Ray Huston. Mr Huston was the director from 1965 until 1968.

Competing contemporaneous designs in the USSR included the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich DIS and Tairov Ta-3. Only two prototypes were built because its intended engines proved to be too unreliable to be placed into production and the engines' manufacturer lacked the resources to fix the problems. The second prototype crashed in September 1944 and the program was canceled after the death of Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov, the chief designer of his eponymous OKB, earlier that year. Design and development The original request for proposals for a heavy escort fighter (Tyazholyy Istrebitel' Soprovozhdeniya) was received at the Polikarpov OKB in November 1938, but the press of work with the I-180 and SPB prototypes prevented any significant design work until the third quarter of 1940. Mikhail Yangel was appointed head designer, but his job was complicated by multiple changes in the role of the aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor, dive bomber, and eventually reconnaissance.Gordon 2008, p. 279 The prototype, internally designated as aircraft or TIS \\"A\\", was a low-wing, all-metal, cantilever monoplane with two Mikulin AM-37 engines and a twin tail. The monocoque fuselage had four ShKAS machine guns in the nose, each with 1,000 rounds. The pilot and the gunner/radio-operator were seated back-to-back, separated by an armor plate, under sliding canopies. The gunner had a dorsal ShKAS on a TSS-1 mount with 750 rounds that could be used once his canopy was slid forward. He also had a ventral ShKAS mounted below the armored floor that he could access by raising a hatch in the floor and kneeling down to fire the machine guns. The ventral gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition. A UBK machine gun with 400 rounds and a ShVAK cannon with 350 rounds were mounted in each wing root.Gordon 2008, pp. 279–280. Underneath the wings were two racks each capable of carrying a single FAB-500 bomb. The wing had automatic leading edge slats and four split flaps separated by the engine nacelles. The single wheel landing gear retracted into the rear part of the nacelles, as did the tailwheel into the fuselage.Gunston 2008, p. 309. The 'A' prototype first flew in September 1941 and reached a speed of at altitude. It suffered from a lack of directional stability and the engines were unreliable and vibrated above . Factory No. 51 attempted to fix the stability problem in late September by increasing the area of the rear fins, but was unsuccessful. Flight testing continued in October in Novosibirsk, to where the LII (—Flight Research Institute) had been evacuated. Eliminating the stability problem took until March 1942, although the engines remained as unreliable as ever.Gordon 2008, p. 280. By the summer of 1942 it was clear that the Mikulin OKB lacked the resources to fix the problems with the AM-37 and that the TIS would need a new engine, but the OKB's resources were fully utilized on the I-185 and ITP programs and the TIS program was put on hold. Work did not resume on the TIS until the second half of 1943, after the I-185 had been canceled, and the Mikulin AM-39 engine was selected. A new prototype was built, internally called the \\"MA\\", with a completely revised armament. Two ShVAK cannon replaced the nose ShKAS machine guns and a UBT machine gun in a VUB-1 mount replaced the dorsal ShKAS, while the ventral machine gun was removed entirely. Two Shpitalny Sh-37 or 111P cannon replaced the wing root guns. The intended AM-39s were unavailable and therefore two Mikulin AM-38Fs were used as a temporary expedient. The engine radiators were moved from the nacelles into the wings. They were fed by inlets in the leading edge and outlets on the undersurface of the wing.Gordon 2008, p. 281 Operational history The \\"MA\\" was flight tested from June to September 1944 and generally met its expected performance figures. The engines were optimized for low altitudes and the aircraft could only reach a maximum speed of and a ceiling of . It did, however, have an initial climb rate of and, on the basis of the flight tests, it was concluded that it would be capable reaching at and would take 6.4 minutes to reach once the AM-39s were fitted. A brake failure on 29 June damaged the \\"MA\\", which required a month to repair, but a crash-landing on 16 September caused by the failure of the undercarriage to extend proved to be the death knell for the TIS program. The OKB was being shut down after Polikarpov's death at the end of June and there was no one willing to champion the TIS.

Madison, Wisc: University of Wisconsin Press, 2004. pp. 132-133, 135 London period Initially Der arbeyter had a circulation of 1,500 copies, intended for distribution inside Congress Poland. Maks Horwitz, the sole Yiddish-speaking intellectual in PPS at the time, was the founding editor of the publication. Der arbeyter argued that a Polish democratic republic had to be established in order to achieve Jewish emancipation and socialism. It opposed Russification of the Jewish population in Poland. Furthermore, it consistently used the term 'Jew' as a religious, not national, denomination. Catholic Poles were labelled as 'Christians' in its articles, and the publication stressed that Jewish and Christians alike were equally part of the Polish nation and the Polish proletariat. This approach contrasted the line of the General Jewish Labour Bund, who argued that Jews constituted a separate national group in the Russian empire.Zimmerman, Joshua D. Poles, Jews, and the Politics of Nationality: The Bund and the Polish Socialist Party in Late Tsarist Russia, 1892-1914. Madison, Wisc: University of Wisconsin Press, 2004. pp. 143, 153 Der arbeyter was mainly directed towards mobilizing support for PPS amongst Jewish workers in Poland. The PPS lagged behind its competitor, the General Jewish Labour Bund, in terms of Yiddish-language publishing. Thus, PPS felt it could not compete with the Bundist press amongst the Jewish intelligentsia, it concentrated its propaganda work toward Jewish labourers. Der arbeyter dealt with questions of everyday working class life, rather than theoretical articles.Zimmerman, Joshua D.

Madison, Wisc: University of Wisconsin Press, 2004. p. 139 Horwitz, who had edited the first edition of Der arbeyter, was arrested in Warsaw in 1899. Thus the PPS no longer had any person who could manage a Yiddish publication. After Horwitz's arrest, the PPS cadre Leon Wasilewski learned Yiddish so that the publication could be continued and a second edition could be published. With the arrival of Feliks Sachs, who spoke fluent Yiddish, to the PPS centre in London, two more editions were published in 1901 (April and August).Zimmerman, Joshua D.

He won in the 1996 elections but could not defend the seat in those of 2001 because an electoral pact between the TMC and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) entailed that it would be contested by a candidate from the AIADMK and not by the TMC. He was president of the town panchayat when the TMC merged back into the INC after the death of its founder, G. K. Moopanar, and he then became district president of the INC. Despite his position, he was overlooked as a candidate in the 2006 elections, with the party instead nominating D. Arul Anbarasu, the son of Era. Anbarasu, a prominent INC politician at state level. He and his brothers stayed with the INC, who won the seat, but when Munirathinam was again overlooked by the party in favour of Anbarasu at the time of the 2011 elections, he opted to stand as an independent. He came second with 34 per cent of the vote, while Anbarasu was well behind in third place.

Leon Aubvineau, Paris, 1865, p. 423 was an Italian Catholic Cardinal and Cardinal-Nephew of Pope Innocent X who served as Cardinal Priest of San Pietro in Montorio (1653–1662), Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals (1661–1662), and Archbishop (personal title) of Catania (1661–1663).\\"Camillo Cardinal Astalli-Pamphilj\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved September 19, 2016 Early life Camillo Astalli belonged to a noble but relatively poor family. He was born in Sambuci, at Tivoli, 21 October 1616 to Fulvio and Catherine Pinelli Astalli. He studied at the Roman College and in 1640 graduated from the Sapienza with a doctorate in civil and ecclesiastical law, commencing a career as a consistorial lawyer. Following his brother's marriage to Catherine Maidalchini Tiberius, the niece of Olimpia Maidalchini, sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X, he began his rise in the church hierarchy. (From this a number of records refer to Maidalchini as his cousin.)De Caro, Gasparo. \\"Astalli, Caillo\\", Dizionario Biografico, Treccani, vol.4, 1962 He became the assistant to the Secretary of State, Cardinal Giovanni Giacomo Panciroli, who proposed him for the post of cardinal-nephew, which had been left vacant in 1647 by the resignation of the Cardinal Camillo Pamphilj.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Ecclesiastic career When first elected to the papal throne, Pope Innocent X had appointed his nephew, Camillo Pamphili as his Cardinal-Nephew. But Pamphili resigned his position to marry and was replaced by Francesco Maidalchini, nephew of Donna Olimpia Maidalchini. When Maidalchini proved to be a disgraceful failure, Innocent sought the advice of his Cardinal Secretary of State, Cardinal Panciroli who suggested Astalli. So it was that Astalli was elevated to Cardinal on 19 September 1650 by the Pope, who simultaneously adopted him into the Pamphili family (as Camillo Astalli-Pamphili) and appointed him Cardinal-Nephew. Innocent also presented him with a substantial income, the Palazzo Pamphili in Piazza Navona and the villa outside the Porta San Pancrazio. He served as governor of Fermo and papal legate for the district of Avignon from 1650 to 1653. Downfall In his absence, though, Cardinal Panciroli died and Astalli believed his good fortune would fade with the death of his mentor. In particular, Donna Olimpia Maidalchini had been gaining favour with her brother-in-law the Pope. Seeking support from abroad, Astalli took King Philip IV of Spain for his patron. The unexpected generosity of the pope, however, put him against the Pamphilj family and especially Donna Olimpia, so much so that, aided by a series of bad policy choices, as well as a certain inability to handle the Roman Curia, he soon fell out of favor at the papal Court. In February 1654, with little warning, Pope Innocent stripped Astalli of his titles for allegedly revealing the secrets of state to Spain (plans to invade the Kingdom of Naples). The offence was uncovered by Maidalchini's \\"spy\\", Decio Azzolino. The Pope deprived him of the title of Cardinal-Nephew. Astalli was sent from Rome to govern the Diocese of Ferrara. However he did not accept this position and it so infuriated Innocent X that revoked all privileges, even eliminating his adoption into the Pamphili family. He forbade Astalli to use the family name and arms of Pamphili, and in 1655 exiled him to Sambuci. On the death of the pope, as a sign of contempt, Astalli showed up at the funeral without being dressed in mourning. Contemporary John Bargrave would later recall that at the funeral of Cardinal Panciroli (at the Quirinal Palace), others told him that it had been the Pope's plan all along for Astalli to take responsibility for a number of failures and scandals and then be removed shortly before the Pope's death to ensure his estate was inherited by his original Cardinal-Nephew, Camillo Pamphili. Later career Nonetheless, when Innocent X died, Astalli was still a Cardinal and participated in the papal conclave of 1655S. Miranda: Camillo Astalli which elected Pope Alexander VII. He was later, rather ironically, appointed cardinal-protector of the Kingdom of Naples. On 24 January 1661 the cardinals elected him to the post of Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals for the annual term (until 16 January 1662). On instructions of Philip IV on July 14, 1661, he was elected during the papacy of Pope Alexander VII as Archbishop (personal title) of Catania. On July 25, 1661, he was consecrated bishop in the church of San Giacomo in Rome by Cardinal Federico Sforza, with Emilio Altieri, Bishop of Camerino, and by Alessandro Crescenzi, Bishop of Bitonto, serving as co-consecrators. He died on December 21, 1663 in Catania and was buried in the metropolitan cathedral of Catania.

In 2002-2003, The Tagus Group presided by José Ávila acquired all rights to the publication and significantly modernized The Portuguese Tribune—increasing the number of contributors and columnists of all ages and opinions, focusing on community events rather than news from Portugal (that subscribers already had access through the web, RTPi TV, and other Portuguese language radio stations), committing to a more in-depth English language section, publishing the newspaper on its entirety on the web with a worldwide readership, redesigning it into a fresh layout, leading to a more than 100% increase in subscribers.Miguel Valle Ávila, \\"Parabens Nossa Tribuna.\\" The Portuguese Tribune. 30th Anniversary Edition. September 1, 2009. From its original address on Alum Rock Avenue to the corner of 33rd Street to the rectory of Five Wounds Portuguese National Church to 27th Street, all in San Jose's Little Portugal district to its present address in Modesto, The Portuguese Tribune has evolved with the times and celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2009.  Other Portuguese newspapers in California  The Portuguese Tribune was the 28th Portuguese newspaper to be founded in California since A Voz Portuguesa (Portuguese Voice) in 1884 in San Francisco. The Portuguese Tribune was the first Portuguese newspaper in California since the Capelinhos Volcano wave of immigration from the Azores Islands. Since then, others were established, but none other than The Portuguese Tribune has survived: Notícia (News) 1985-1986, Portugal-USA 1986-1987, Luso-Americano California 1992-1995, Portuguese-American Chronicle 1997-2006, and Lusitania News 2006.Fernando Manuel Soares Silva, PhD, \\"The Portuguese Press in California.\\" Capelinhos, A Volcano of Sinergies.

It is applied in several technological processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Typically, granulation involves agglomeration of fine particles into larger granules, typically of size range between 0.2 and 4.0 mm depending on their subsequent use. Less commonly, it involves shredding or grinding solid material into finer granules or pellets. From powder The granulation process combines one or more powder particles and forms a granule that will allow tableting to be within required limits. It is the process of collecting particles together by creating bonds between them. Bonds are formed by compression or by using a binding agent. Granulation is extensively used in the pharmaceutical industry, for manufacturing of tablets and pellets. This way predictable and repeatable process is possible and granules of consistent quality can be produced. Granulation is carried out for various reasons, one of which is to prevent the segregation of the constituents of powder mix. Segregation is due to differences in the size or density of the components of the mix. Normally, the smaller and/or denser particles tend to concentrate at the base of the container with the larger and/or less dense ones on the top. An ideal granulation will contain all the constituents of the mix in the correct proportion in each granule and segregation of granules will not occur. Many powders, because of their small size, irregular shape or surface characteristics, are cohesive and do not flow well. Granules produced from such a cohesive system will be larger and more isodiametric (roughly spherical), both factors contributing to improved flow properties. Some powders are difficult to compact even if a readily compactable adhesive is included in the mix, but granules of the same powders are often more easily compacted. This is associated with the distribution of the adhesive within the granule and is a function of the method employed to produce the granule. For example, if one were to make tablets from granulated sugar versus powdered sugar, powdered sugar would be difficult to compress into a tablet and granulated sugar would be easy to compress. Powdered sugar’s small particles have poor flow and compression characteristics. These small particles would have to be compressed very slowly for a long period of time to make a worthwhile tablet. Unless the powdered sugar is granulated, it could not efficiently be made into a tablet that has good tablet characteristics such as uniform content or consistent hardness. Two types of granulation technologies are employed: wet granulation and dry granulation. Wet granulation In wet granulation, granules are formed by the addition of a granulation liquid onto a powder bed which is under the influence of an impeller (in a high-shear granulator), screws (in a twin screw granulator) or air (in a fluidized bed granulator). The agitation resulting in the system along with the wetting of the components within the formulation results in the aggregation of the primary powder particles to produce wet granules. The granulation liquid (fluid) contains a solvent or carrier material which must be volatile so that it can be removed by drying, and depending on the intended application, be non-toxic. Typical liquids include water, ethanol and isopropanol either alone or in combination. The liquid solution can be either aqueous based or solvent- based. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than other solvents. Water mixed into the powders can form bonds between powder particles that are strong enough to lock them together. However, once the water dries, the powders may fall apart. Therefore, water may not be strong enough to create and hold a bond. In such instances, a liquid solution that includes a binder (pharmaceutical glue) is required. Povidone, which is a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), is one of the most commonly used pharmaceutical binders. PVP is dissolved in water or solvent and added to the process. When PVP and a solvent/water are mixed with powders, PVP forms a bond with the powders during the process, and the solvent/water evaporates (dries). Once the solvent/water has been dried and the powders have formed a more densely held mass, then the granulation is milled. This process results in the formation of granules. The process can be very simple or very complex depending on the characteristics of the powders, the final objective of tablet making, and the equipment that is available. In the traditional wet granulation method the wet mass is forced through a sieve to produce wet granules which are subsequently dried. Wet granulation is traditionally a batch process in the pharmaceutical production, however, the batch type wet granulations are foreseen to be replaced more and more by continuous wet granulation in the pharmaceutical industry in the future. The shift from batch to continuous technologies has been recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. This continuous wet granulation technology can be carried out on a twin-screw extruder into which solid materials and water can be fed at various parts. In the extruder the materials are mixed and granulated due to the intermesh of the screws, especially at the kneading elements. Dry granulation The dry granulation process is used to form granules without a liquid solution because the product granulated may be sensitive to moisture and heat. Forming granules without moisture requires compacting and densifying the powders. In this process the primary powder particles are aggregated under high pressure. A swaying granulator or a roll compactor can be used for the dry granulation. Dry granulation can be conducted under two processes; either a large tablet (slug) is produced in a heavy duty tabletting press or the powder is squeezed between two counter-rotating rollers to produce a continuous sheet or ribbon of material. When a tablet press is used for dry granulation, the powders may not possess enough natural flow to feed the product uniformly into the die cavity, resulting in varying density. The roller compactor (granulator-compactor) uses an auger-feed system that will consistently deliver powder uniformly between two pressure rollers. The powders are compacted into a ribbon or small pellets between these rollers and milled through a low-shear mill. When the product is compacted properly, then it can be passed through a mill and final blend before tablet compression. Typical roller compaction processes consist of the following steps: convey powdered material to the compaction area, normally with a screw feeder, compact powder between two counter-rotating rolls with applied forces, mill resulting compact to desired particle size distribution. Roller compacted particle are typically dense, with sharp-edged profiles. From solids Plastic granulation and pelletizing line; extrusion, cooling, and cutting In plastic recycling, granulation is the process of shredding plastic objects to be recycled into flakes or pellets, suitable for later reuse in plastics extrusion. In the first stage, plastic objects to be recycled are fed to an electric motor-powered cutting chamber, which continually cuts the material using one of several types of cutting systems. Some systems use a scissor-like cutting motion, chevron or V-type rotor helical rotor or fly knives. The material is ground into all the smaller flakes until they became fine enough to fall through a mesh screen. In wet- granulation lines, water is continually sprayed in the cutting chamber to remove the debris and impurities, and acts as a lubricant of the steel blades; in dry-granulation lines, water is not present, but such technology generally produces output of lower quality than the wet technology. While the process is relatively simple, it must be carefully parametrized, as the high temperatures resulting from friction can damage the material and affect its plasticity. Regular maintenance and sharpening of the scissor blades are essential, as well as close monitoring of the process due to potential clogging and jamming. In many cases, granulation may be the only step required before the plastics can be reused for manufacturing of new products. In other, the new or recycled plastic material must be remade into pellets. The material is molten and extruded into thin rods, which are then cooled in a water tank and finely chopped into small cylindrical pellets.

U 1043 is the Rundata designation for a runic inscription on a memorial runestone located in Onslunda, Tensta parish, and about four kilometers west of Vattholma, Sweden, which was in the historic province of Uppland. While the tradition of carving inscriptions into boulders began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, most runestones date from the late Viking Age. Description The runic inscription consists of a runic text carved on a serpent that twists around the edge of the stone and circles a Christian cross. The stone is granite and is 1.6 meters in height.Riksantikvarieämbetet - Swedish National Heritage Board record for U 1043. Red paint fragments have been found in the inscription, supporting the theory that many runestones had inscriptions that were also painted. The runic text indicates that it is a memorial by three sons to their father. Consistent with the cross in the design, the text ends in a prayer for the father's soul. Of the personal names in the runic text, the father's name Ófeigr combines the negative prefix ó with feigr, which means \\"death bound\\" or \\"fated to die\\" without any negative connotations intended. The father's name could thus mean \\"not fated to die,\\" which would also be consistent with this runestone identification as a Christian memorial erected in the decades following the Christianization of this part of Sweden. This runestone has been attributed to the runemaster Åsmund Kåresson on stylistic grounds. Åsmund was active in the first half of the eleventh century. The inscription is carved in runestone style Pr3 - Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond- shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runestone also includes a stylized depiction of a couple engaged in sexual intercourse. It has been suggested that the couple does not appear to be part of the original design on this stone and that such a depiction is atypical for this period and region. No other depictions of actual intercourse are known to exist from the Viking Age.

The case established that if a person enters a contract under a mistake that was not induced by the other party to the contract, specific performance may be awarded against the person if no hardship amounting to clear injustice would be inflicted on the person by holding him/her to the contract. The High Court of Australia has described its proposition as \\"a party to a contract cannot... escape specific performance by simply swearing that he did not understand it\\".. Facts The plaintiffs (James) advertised a lot of land for sale in the following terms: > All that well-accustomed inn, with the brewhouse, outbuildings, and premises > known as The Ship, together with the messuage, saddler's shop, and premises > adjoining thereto, situate at Newerne, in the same parish, No. 454 and 455 > on the said tithe map, and containing by admeasurement twenty perches, more > or less, now in the occupation of Mrs. Knowles and Mr. S. Merrick. > This lot is situate close to the Lydney Town station, on the Severn and Wye > Railway, and abuts on other premises of the vendors, on the canal, and on > lands now or late of the Rev. W. H. Bathurst. The defendant (Tamplin) signed a contract to purchase the lot for £750. The defendant did not perform the contract of sale. He deposed to the primary judge (Baggallay LJ) that he expected that two pieces of garden formed part of the lot, when they were in fact held by a railway company and not the vendor. The primary judge found that at the auction for the lot, plans were made available that showed that the gardens were not part of the lot, but that the defendant did not inspect the plans. The primary judge made a decree for specific performance to compel the defendant's purchase of the land. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal. Judgment The three presiding judges of the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeal, upholding the decree for specific performance. The judges were Sir William Milbourne James (James LJ), Viscount Esher (Brett LJ) and Sir Henry Cotton (Cotton LJ). James LJ held that the defence to specific performance for mistake could not generally be sustained where the vendor did nothing to mislead the purchaser and the mistake arose because of the purchaser's lack of reasonable care (here, the failure to inspect the plans). However, James LJ left it open for specific performance to be excused where: > ...a hardship amounting to injustice would have been inflicted upon [the > purchaser] by holding him to his bargain, and it was unreasonable to hold > him to it. James LJ found that the defendant's mistaken purchase of the lot did not fall within this category of unjust hardship. James LJ agreed with Cotton LJ (in obiter) that where specific performance is not awarded because of a mistake, the court should proceed to award damages to the plaintiff in lieu of specific performance. Brett LJ agreed to uphold the decree for specific performance, suggesting that a purchaser could not be relieved from specific performance for a mistake that was not of vital importance to the contract and arose from the purchaser's own negligence. Cotton LJ also agreed to uphold the decree for specific performance, holding that a purchaser could not escape specific performance for a mistake that \\"he had no right to make\\". Cotton LJ argued (in obiter) (James LJ agreeing) that where specific performance is not awarded because of a mistake, the court should proceed to award damages to the plaintiff in lieu of specific performance. Significance Tamplin v James is a widely cited case on the availability of specific performance. Brett LJ's judgment is cited in Voumard: The Sale of Land for the proposition that: > For the most part the cases where a defendant has escaped [specific > performance] on the ground of a mistake not contributed to by the plaintiff, > have been cases where a hardship amounting to injustice would have been > inflicted upon him by holding him to his bargain, and it was unreasonable to > hold him to it. The case has also been regularly cited by appellate courts as an authority on specific performance. The High Court of Australia has relied on the case for the proposition that \\"a party to a contract cannot... escape specific performance by simply swearing that he did not understand it\\"..

Its six books are called \\"The Sofa\\", \\"The Timepiece\\", \\"The Garden\\", \\"The Winter Evening\\", \\"The Winter Morning Walk\\" and \\"The Winter Walk at Noon\\". Beginning with a mock- Miltonic passage on the origins of the sofa, it develops into a discursive meditation on the blessings of nature, the retired life and religious faith, with attacks on slavery, blood sports, fashionable frivolity, lukewarm clergy and French despotism among other things. Cowper's subjects are those that occur to him naturally in the course of his reflections rather than being suggested by poetic convention, and the diction throughout is, for an 18th- century poem, unusually conversational and unartificial. As the poet himself writes, Writing and publication William Cowper in 1792, by Lemuel Francis Abbott Cowper prefaced The Task with an account of its genesis: > A lady, fond of blank verse, demanded a poem of that kind from the Author, > and gave him the SOFA for a subject. He obeyed; and, having much leisure, > connected another subject with it; and, pursuing the train of thought to > which his situation and turn of mind led him, brought forth at length, > instead of the trifle which he at first intended, a serious affair – a > Volume.Advertisement to The Task Lady Austen, a friend of Cowper's in the early 1780s, made this suggestion in the early summer of 1783, and he took the idea up, continuing in spite of sporadic returns of the depressive illness from which he suffered so much. On its completion the following year the poem was sent to Cowper's publisher Joseph Johnson, who had previously issued Cowper's Poems (1782). It was decided to add three shorter poems, An Epistle to Joseph Hill, Tirocinium and The Diverting History of John Gilpin, but, because of delays on Johnson’s part, the book did not appear until 1785. The venture was successful, and was soon followed by a second edition of the Poems in two volumes, The Task and its three attendants forming the second volume.Robert Southey The Life of William Cowper, Esq. (Boston: Otis, Broaders, 1839) vol. 1, pp. 268-307. Further editions were called for at short intervals for the next 40 years, for The Task had so caught the Evangelical spirit of the age that, according to one critic, \\"As Paradise Lost is to militant Puritanism, so is The Task to the religious movement of its author's time.\\"Goldwin Smith Cowper (London: Macmillan, 1880) p. 62. Influence In a letter Robert Burns wrote, > Is not The Task a glorious poem? The religion of The Task, bating a few > scraps of Calvinistic divinity, is the religion of God and Nature: the > religion that exalts, that ennobles man. He is said to have loved the poem enough to have habitually walked about with a copy in his pocket. The Works of Robert Burns (London: James Cochrane, 1834) vol. 3, p. 252. The poem is extensively quoted in the novels of Jane Austen, and has been seen as deeply influential on her.Christopher Brooke Jane Austen: Illusion and Reality (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1999) pp. 127-8. The conversational diction of the Lake Poets' works can be seen as stemming directly from The Task. Certainly the young Coleridge wrote of Cowper's \\"divine Chit chat\\", and in later years praised The Task's \\"chastity of diction\\" and \\"harmony of blank verse\\".Emerson R. Marks Taming the Chaos: English Poetic Diction Theory Since the Renaissance (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998) p. 367; Earl Leslie Griggs (ed.) The Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956-1971) vol. 1, p. 279. In a 1796 letter Charles Lamb testified to Coleridge's thorough relish for Cowper, and on his own account wrote of Cowper as an old favourite and of \\"reading the Task with fresh delight\\".Edwin W. Marrs, Jr. (ed.)

Robert Woof) Wordsworth's Hawkshead (1970) p. 344; Kenneth R. Johnston The Hidden Wordsworth (London: Pimlico, 2000) p. 67.

(which stands for \\"4 girls, 3 days, 2 cities, 1 chance\\") is a 2010 British-American crime thriller film directed by Noel Clarke and Mark Davis, written by Clarke and starring Emma Roberts, Tamsin Egerton, Ophelia Lovibond, Shanika-Warren Markland, Mandy Patinkin, Helen McCrory, Kevin Smith, Susannah Fielding, Camille Coduri and Clarke. It was released on 2 June 2010.  Plot  Four 19-year-old friends: Joanne, Cassandra, Shannon, and Kerrys, all meet one other at a diner, where they see Dillon and Smoothy. As the police turn up, Dillon and Smoothy run off and Dillon accidentally drops a stolen diamond into Cassandra's bag. The four girls then walk out and go their separate ways home. Shannon returns home just as her mother is leaving her father. Jo calls Shannon over to the 24-hour supermarket where she works with Angelo, but tells her to leave as soon as she arrives. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo, upsetting Shannon, so she grabs a Pringles tube from the shop and runs away. After getting drunk at a bar, Shannon is attacked by a gang and then rescued by Kelly. Shannon finds out that Kelly is searching for \\"15 diamonds\\". One is already in Cassandra's bag, and the rest are in the tube that fell out of Shannon's bag when she was attacked. Shannon escapes and retrieves the tube, then leaves a message informing Jo about diamonds. Later, Shannon tracks down her mother and accuses her of not caring about her, especially when she forced her to get an abortion. Shannon soon holds the diamonds above a bridge, contemplating suicide. Meanwhile, Cassandra visits New York City to meet up with Brett, whom she has met on the internet, and audition for a piano school. She has sex with Brett and in the morning finds all her possessions gone, except for her handbag, which contains a diamond. She also finds a letter written by Shannon's mother explaining why she left. She mails it to Kerrys' house to deliver it to Shannon. She goes to Brett's house to find that Brett is a stalker who hacked into Cassandra's computer, taking videos of her. When the fake Brett comes, she knocks him out and erases the footage and proceeds to take photos of his genitals as revenge. Cassandra forces her way into an impromptu audition with Jago Larofsky and wins a place at his school. She then leaves to go home to London, telling Jo she knows where Shannon is. After witnessing her brother Manuel receive a package with instructions from Dillon and Smoothy, Kerrys and her girlfriend Jas break into Cassandra's home and stay there for the weekend. Manuel arrives there and they discover a panic room. Manuel locks them in the panic room, returns the package to Dillon and Smoothy as instructed and throws a party. When the two girls escape from the panic room, they angrily force everyone out of the flat. Kerrys goes home and finds Shannon's mother's letter that Cassandra had sent her. After making amends with her father, she locks Manuel in the trunk of his new car and drives off to find Shannon, but when he tries to attack her, she crashes the car into Jo's shop. Jo begins to become suspicious of her new manager, Tee, who has been working with Dillon and Smoothy to deliver the diamonds, but one is missing. Dillon and Smoothy come to get the money, but find that Tee has betrayed them, keeping the money for himself, and they hold up the store in retaliation. When Shannon arrives, Jo tries to make her leave and Dillon kisses Jo, whom unseen to Shannon, is at gunpoint. Shannon leaves, stealing the Pringles, and Dillon and Smoothy escape, leaving Tee with the 14 diamonds, which Tee had hidden in the tube that Shannon stole. The next day, Jo realizes that Shannon has the diamonds, and when Tee is about to be shot by Kelly, Jo rescues him before Kerrys crashes Manuel's car into the shop. Jo helps Kerrys escape and leaves a note and a DVD implicating Tee, but when he tries to run, Angelo attacks him and Tee is then arrested by the police. Cassandra returns with the last diamond. She meets Jo and Kerrys and they go to find Shannon. They talk her down and give her the letter, comforting her. They put the 15 diamonds together, give them to the police and fly to New York City with Kelly also on the plane.

He was director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and is considered one of the founders of the institute, Courant and Friedrichs being the others. Stoker is known for his work in differential geometry and theory of water waves. He is also the author of the now classic book Water Waves: The Mathematical Theory with Applications. Career Hailing from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Stoker started his career as a mining engineer. In the 1930s, he went to Zürich to pursue a doctorate in mechanics at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. One of the first courses he took there was by Heinz Hopf on geometry. Stoker was so impressed by the subject, and the teacher, that he switched his doctoral programme to differential geometry He received his Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Hopf and George Pólya. Hopf later recommended Stoker to Richard Courant. In 1937 Stoker, along with Courant's former student Kurt O. Friedrichs, joined Courant in the Department of Mathematics at the New York University. With Stoker's engineering background and Friedrichs' mastery in mathematics, the two were effectively collaborated on many applied problems such as plate theory. On Courant's retirement in 1958 Stoker succeeded him as director and served until 1966. It was during Stoker's period as director, the Institute acquired greater autonomy within the University framework. It became the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1965.

While the tradition of carving inscriptions into boulders began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, most runestones date from the late Viking Age. Description The runic inscription states that it was Øpiʀ risti (\\"Öpir carved\\"), indicating that it was carved by the runemaster Öpir, who was active in the late 11th or early 12th century. The inscription is carved in runestone style Pr5, also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runestone shows a cross with the inscription within a serpent around the edge. Although damaged at the top, the runestone formerly had a man's mask above the Christian cross, a motif used on some other runestones such as Sö 86 in Åby ägor, Sö 112 in Kolunda, Sö 367 in Landshammar, Na 34 in Nasta, and U 678 in Skokloster. Other inscriptions with masks but without crosses include DR 62 in Sjelle, DR 66 in Århus, DR 81 in Skern, DR 258 in Bösarp, the now-lost DR 286 in Hunnestad, DR 314 in Lund, DR 335 in Västra Strö, Vg 106 in Lassegården, Sö 367 in Släbro, U 508 in Gillberga, U 670 in Rölunda, U 824 in Holms, and U 1150 in Björklinge, and on the Sjellebro Stone. Although the runestone is marked with a Christian cross, three of the personal names mentioned in the inscription contain the Norse pagan god Thor as a name element. The name Þorbjôrn translates as \\"Thor Bear,\\" Þorsteinn as \\"Thor's Stone,\\" and Þorfastr as \\"Thor Fast\\" (fast in the sense of holding one's ground in battle). These three names in the inscription also reflect a common practice of that time in Scandinavia of repeating an element in a parent's name in the names of children. p. 750. Here the Þor from the father's name, Þorfastr, is repeated in the names of two of his sons, Þorbjôrn and Þorsteinn, to show the family relationship.

PEA has been studied in in vitro and in vivo systems using exogenously added or dosed compound; there is evidence that it binds to a nuclear receptor, through which it exerts a variety of biological effects, some related to chronic inflammation and pain. A main target of PEA is proposed to be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). PEA also has affinity to cannabinoid-like G-coupled receptors GPR55 and GPR119. PEA cannot strictly be considered a classic endocannabinoid because it lacks affinity for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. However, primary research supports the conclusion that the presence of PEA (or other structurally related N-acylethanolamines) enhances anandamide activity by an \\"entourage effect\\". Some primary research reports support the conclusion that PEA levels are altered and that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is \\"imbalanced\\" in acute and chronic inflammation. A primary research article, for instance, has reported that the deregulation of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands accompanies the development and progression of β-amyloid-induced neuroinflammation. In some primary research studies, PEA has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, neuroprotective, and anticonvulsant properties. Early studies Palmitoylethanolamide was discovered in 1957. Indications for its use as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic date from before 1980. In that year, researchers described what they called \\"N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-palmitamide\\" as a natural anti-inflammatory agent, stating, \\"We have succeeded in isolating a crystalline anti-inflammatory factor from soybean lecithin and identifying it as (S)-(2-hydroxyethyl)-palmitamide. The compound also was isolated from a phospholipid fraction of egg yolk and from hexane-extracted peanut meal.\\" In 1975, Czech physicians described the results of a clinical trial looking at joint pain, where the analgesic action of aspirin versus PEA were tested; both drugs were reported to enhance joint movements and decrease pain. In 1970 the drug manufacturer Spofa in Czechoslovakia introduced Impulsin, a tablet dose of PEA, for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory infections. In Spain, the company Almirall introduced Palmidrol in tablet and suspension forms in 1976, for the same indications. In the mid 1990s, the relationship between anandamide and PEA was described; the expression of mast cell receptors sensitive to the two molecules was demonstrated by Levi- Montalcini and coworkers. During this period, more insight into the functions of endogenous fatty acid derivatives emerged, and compounds such as oleamide, palmitoylethanolamide, 2-lineoylglycerol and 2-palmitoylglycerol were explored for their capacity to modulate pain sensitivity and inflammation via what at that time was thought to be the endocannabinoid signalling pathway. Primary reports also have provided evidence that PEA downregulates hyperactive mast cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that it might likewise alleviate pain behaviors elicited in mice-pain models. PEA and related compounds such as anandamide also seem to have synergistic effects in models of pain and analgesia. Animal models In a variety of animal models, PEA seems to have some promise; researchers have been able to demonstrate relevant clinical efficacy in a variety of disorders, from multiple sclerosis to neuropathic pain. In the mouse forced swimming test, palmitoylethanolamide was comparable to fluoxetine for depression. An Italian study published in 2011 found that PEA reduced the raised intraocular pressure of glaucoma. In a spinal trauma model, PEA reduced the resulting neurological deficit via the reduction of mast cell infiltration and activation. PEA in this model also reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its activity as an inhibitor of inflammation counteracts reactive astrogliosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide, in a model relevant for neurodegeneration, probably via the PPAR-α mechanism of action. In models of stroke and other CNS trauma, PEA exerted neuroprotective properties. Animal models of chronic pain and inflammation Chronic pain and neuropathic pain are indications for which there is high unmet need in the clinic. PEA has been tested in a variety of animal models for chronic and neuropathic pain. As cannabinoids, such as THC, have been proven to be effective in neuropathic pain states. The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of PEA in two models of acute and persistent pain seemed to be explained at least partly via the de novo neurosteroid synthesis. In chronic granulomatous pain and inflammation model, PEA could prevent nerve formation and sprouting, mechanical allodynia, and PEA inhibited dorsal root ganglia activation, which is a hallmark for winding up in neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of PEA as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory molecule is probably based on different aspects. PEA inhibits the release of both preformed and newly synthesised mast cell mediators, such as histamine and TNF-alpha. PEA, as well as its analogue adelmidrol (di-amide derivative of azelaic acid), can both down-regulate mast cells. PEA reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prevents IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the latter related to PEA as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist. In 2012 it became clear that PEA can also reduce reperfusion injury and the negative impact of shock on various outcome parameters, such as renal dysfunction, ischemic injury and inflammation, most probably via the PPAR-alpha pathway. Among the reperfusion and inflammation markers measured PEA could reduce the increase in creatinine, γGT, AST, nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; kidney MPO activity and MDA levels, nitrotyrosine, PAR and adhesion molecules expression, the infiltration and activation of mastcells and apoptosis. The biological responses to PEA dosing in animal models and in humans are being investigated vis-à-vis its involvement in a repair mechanism relevant to patient conditions of chronic inflammation and chronic pain. In a model of visceral pain (inflammation of the urinary bladder) PEA was able to attenuate the viscero- visceral hyper-reflexia induced by inflammation of the urinary bladder, one of the reasons why PEA is currently explored in the painful bladdersyndrome. In a different model for bladder pain, the turpentine-induced urinary bladder inflammation in the rat, PEA also attenuated a referred hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent way. Chronic pelvic pain in patients seem to respond favourably to a treatment with PEA. Activity in non-neuronal cells PEA, as an N-acylethanolamine, has physico-chemical properties comparable to anandamide, and, while it is not strictly an endocannabinoid, it is often studied in conjunction with anandamide because of their overlapping synthetic and metabolic pathways. N-acylethanolamines such as PEA often act as signaling molecules, activating receptors and regulating a variety of physiological functions. PEA is known to activate intracellular, nuclear and membrane- associated receptors, and to regulate many physiological functions related to the inflammatory cascade and chronic pain states. Endocannabinoid lipids like PEA are widely distributed in nature, in a variety of plant, invertebrate, and mammalian tissues. PEA's mechanism of action sometimes is described as Autacoid Local Injury Antagonism (acronym ALIA), and PEA under this nomenclature is an ALIAmide. Levi-Montalcini and coworkers presented evidence in 1993 that lipid amides of the N-acylethanolamine type, such as PEA, are potential prototypes of naturally occurring molecules capable of modulating mast cell activation, and her group used the acronym ALIA in that report. An autocoid is a regulating molecule, locally produced. An ALIAmide is an autocoid synthesized on-demand in response to injury, and acts locally to counteract such pathology. soon after the breakthrough paper of Levi- Montalcini, The mast cell appeared to be an important target for the anti- inflammatory activity of PEA. Since 1993, at least 25 papers have been published on the various effects of PEA on mast cells. These cells are often found in proximity to sensory nerve endings, and their degranulation can enhance the nociceptive signal, the reason why peripheral mast cells are considered to be pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive. PEA's activity is currently seen as a new inroad in the treatment of neuropathic pain and related disorders based on overactivation of glia and glia-related cells, such as in diabetes and glaucoma. Microglia plays a key role in the winding up phenomena and central sensitization. Clinical relevance Effects of oral dosing of PEA has been explored in humans, and include clinical trials for a variety of pain states, for inflammatory and pain syndromes. An observed positive influence in atopic eczema, for instance, seems to originate from PPAR alpha activation. In a 2012 review, all clinical trials to date were summarized. In a 2015 analysis of a double blind placebo controlled study of PEA in sciatic pain, the Numbers Needed to Treat was 1.5. Its positive influence in chronic pain, and inflammatory states such as atopic eczema, seems to originate mainly from PPAR alpha activation. Since 2012 a number of new trials have been published, among which studies in glaucoma. PEA also seems to be one of the factors responsible for the decrease in pain sensitivity during and after sport, comparable to the endogenous opiates (endorphines). From a clinical perspective the most important and promising indications for PEA are linked to neuropathic and chronic pain states, such as diabetic neuropathic pain, sciatic pain, CRPS, pelvic pain and entrapment neuropathic painstates. In a blind trial reported in a conference proceeding, patients affected by pain from synovitis or TMJ osteoarthritis (N=25, in total) were randomly assigned to PEA or ibuprofen groups for two weeks; the decrease in pain reported after two weeks was significantly higher for the PEA-treated group, likewise for improved masticatory function. In 2012, 20 patients suffering from thalidomide and bortezomib induced neuropathy were reported to have improved nerve functions and less pain after a two-month treatment with PEA. The authors pointed out that although a placebo effect might play a role in the reported pain relief, the changes in neurophysiological measures clearly indicated that PEA exerted a positive action on the myelinated fibre groups. Sixteen men and fourteen women suffering from two major types of neuropathic pain refractory to analgesic treatment—peripheral diabetic neuropathy (4 men, 7 women) or post-herpetic neuralgia (12 men, 7 women)In the article, these appear as \\"neuropatia diabetica periferica... o a nevralgia post herpetica\\". See Desio, op. cit.—whose symptoms spanned eight pain categories (\\"burning\\", \\"osteoarticular\\", \\"piercing\\", etc.These terms were \\"urente\\", \\"osteoarticolare\\", \\"lancinante\\", etc. See Table 1 in Desio, op. cit.) who were under prior treatment with pregabalin were transferred to PEA, after which pregabalin treatment was gradually reintroduced; all were responding well after 45 days, and presented significant decreases in painscores (without drug-drug interactions). In 2013, a metareview was published on the clinical efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of the common cold and influenza, based on reports from six double-blind, placebo, randomized controlled trials, addressing PEA's proposed anti-inflammatory and retinoprotectant effects. In 2019, significant increases in fatty acid amides including PEA, arachidonoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide were noted in a Scottish woman with a previously undocumented variant of congenital insensitivity to pain. This was found to be a result of a combination of a hypomorphic single nucleotide polymorphism of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), alongside a mutation of the pseudogene, FAAH-OUT. The pseudogene was previously considered to be non-coding DNA, FAAH-OUT was found to be capable of modulating the expression of FAAH, making it a possible future target for novel analgesia/anxiolytic drug development. In 2020, PEA has been suggested as a drug that may prove beneficial for the treatment of lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. A pharmaceutical company called FSD Pharma have entered PEA into a Phase 1 clinical trial under the name FSD-201, and has approval from the FDA for progressing to Phase 2a for this indication. Metabolism PEA is metabolized by the cellular enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase (NAAA), the latter of which has more specificity toward PEA over other fatty acid amides.

Izola was one of the most historic brand names in Greek industrial history. The company was founded in 1930 as a manufacturer of metal products (mostly metal tubing) and in 1934 was taken over by Panagiotis Drakos who since 1906 owned a company involved in hydraulic equipment trading. Panagiotis and his son Georgios are connected with the spectacular rise of this company that became a dominant manufacturer of home appliances in Greece after World War II. Izola produced equipment for the Greek military during preparations after the outbreak of World War II, while during the Axis occupation its facilities were used by the occupying powers for vehicle repair and maintenance. It recovered soon after the war and in 1951 it introduced its first electric home appliances. Soon an extended range of products was introduced (kitchen ovens, refrigerators, freezers, heaters, TV sets etc.) and the company became a legendary success story in Greek industrial history. These were the times of the Greek economic miracle and industries like Izola benefited greatly from improving living standards. Izola was a classic case of a brand name associated in people's minds with progress, modernity and a more comfortable life. Its demise, however, is equally spectacular and is in a way representative of the sad evolutions in Greek industry in general, after 1980. The beginning of the end came with the disastrous merger with Eskimo, a former competitor, in 1977, after the company had already started facing some economic problems. The new company (Elinda, for [H]ellenic Industry of Appliances) was a financial ruin only a few years later, and in 1991 it effectively went out of business altogether. Today, a huge, idle and run-down factory near Thiva bears testimony to the downfall of one of Greece's most beloved and (once) successful brand names.

He is best remembered for the composition Ut mot havet and the opera Anne Pedersdotter. Personal life Bræin was born in Kristiansund as the son of composer, conductor and organist Edvard Bræin (1887-1957) and his wife Magnhild Fliflet. He married Karen Torjusen in 1946. Career Bræin studied at the institution Musikkonservatoriet i Oslo from 1942 to 1945, and musical composition with Bjarne Brustad and conducting with Odd Grüner-Hegge. His debut as conductor was in Bergen in 1947, with Musikselskabet Harmoniens orkester. His first compositions were De glade musikanter and Konsertouverture from 1948. He studied composition with Jean Rivier in Paris from 1950 to 1951. Bræin wrote symphonies, compositions for piano and orchestra, for flute and orchestra, chamber music and operas. His first symphony was finished in 1950, his second in 1954, and his third in 1968. His best-known composition is Ut mot havet from 1964, originally a song melody (with lyrics by Henrik Straumsheim), and later versions include an arrangement for orchestra, a piano version, and several choir versions. He has further composed melodies for songs with lyrics by Einar Skjæraasen, Jakob Sande, Hartvig Kiran and Johan Herman Wessel. He composed two operas. The opera Anne Pedersdotter was first performed at Den Norske Opera in 1971. It has a libretto by Hans Kristiansen based on a play by Hans Wiers-Jenssen, which was inspired by the witch trial in 1590 against Anne Pedersdotter, the widow of priest Absalon Pederssøn Beyer.

History Seattle-based singer-songwriter Noah Gundersen formed the band The Courage in 2008 in Centralia, Washington. As the group's frontman, Noah Gundersen wrote songs, played guitar, and performed lead vocals for the band. Other founding members of the group included Gundersen's younger sister Abby on violin and backing vocals and two friends, Ivan Gunderson (of no relation to Noah and Abby) on drums and Travis Ehrenstrom on the bass guitar. Founded as a backing band for the purpose of performing Noah Gundersen's solo albums, The Courage began performing together in the Seattle area in 2008. Their initial live performance career was marked by a sold-out live performance at The Triple Door. The live recording of the performance, Live at the Triple Door, was later released as an album under the artist name \\"Noah Gundersen & The Courage\\". This gave insight to the group's work as a pairing of Gundersen's existing solo effort with The Courage acting as a backing band of sorts. Songs on the album are mostly live renditions of songs from Noah Gundersen's solo albums, Brand New World (album) and the unreleased Saints & Liars EP. After the group's live album was released, Noah Gundersen continued to advance in his solo career. His solo EP Saints & Liars was released in 2009 and featured his younger sister Abby on violin and backing vocals, but The Courage was not credited on the album. With Abby Gunderson still in high school and Noah traveling to tour his solo EP, The Courage at first struggled to grow into a full-fledged band after their live album was released. Using the summer as an opportunity to collaborate more closely and transition from a backing band into a full-fledged group, Noah Gundersen & The Courage began to write and record songs for their first studio album, Fearful Bones. The album was recorded in a barn in Sisters, Oregon by Matt Lee, who mixed and produced the album, in the summer of 2010. Prior to release it was decided that the album Fearful Bones would be released under the shortened band name \\"The Courage\\" because the group was one entity - not a pairing of two artists, as it had been previously on the Live at the Triple Door album. Noah dropped his name from the title after deciding to have the entire band more incorporated in the music. He also wanted to move away from more solo, folk-oriented music, saying, \\"I love the sound of a band more than a solo performer. You can only have so many options as a solo performer and I’m not a big fan of loop pedals.\\" In 2011 the group contributed a new song titled \\"All You Know\\" to Burning Building Recordings' compilation album, We Love This Comp, Vol. One. The album was released on Bandcamp. Gundersen released the solo album Family, which launched his solo career, putting an unannounced but definitive end to The Courage. Gundersen's solo career continued to flourish with additional album releases in 2014 with Ledges (album) and Carry the Ghost in 2015. The Courage have not performed together since 2011 and the band's website and Facebook page are no longer accessible.

She wrote over 100 songs as well as two volumes of verse, and became the most commercially successful balled composer managed by her publishers Boosey's, with whom she established one of the first royalty arrangements. Life Charlotte Alington Pye was the daughter of Henry Alington Pye, a solicitor and Charlotte Yerburgh. She married Charles Barnard in 1854: though he was parson of St Olaves in Ruckland, Lincolnshire, they lived at The Firs in Westgate, Louth, Lincolnshire. After Charlotte's presentation at court in 1856, the couple moved to Pimlico. Among their neighbours was the conductor Michael Costa. In London she studied music with the pianist W.H. Holmes and the singer Charlotte Sainton-Dolby. On 8 July 1847, Charlotte laid the foundation stone of Louth railway station. In a visit back to Louth in 1862, Charlotte wrote 20 Spring Songs and sang some of her own compositions at a concert held to clear the debt on the new east window of St James' Church, Louth. A stained glass window in her memory now stands at the west end of the church. By 1864, she had moved to Kirmington rectory as her husband had been appointed Rector of Brocklesby with Kirmington. A prolific balladeer and hymn-writer, Barnard had her first public success as a composer in 1859 with the ballad 'Janet's Choice', written for Charlotte Sainton-Dolby. She is probably best known for 'I Cannot Sing the Old Songs', 'Bide A Wee', 'Won't You Tell Me Why, Robin?' (1861), 'Five O'Clock in the Morning' (1862), 'Mountain Mabel' (1865) and 'Come Back to Erin' (1866). She was also the composer of the hymn tune 'Brocklesby'. In 1868 it was discovered that her much respected father had been systematically stealing money left in his care and trust. He fled to Belgium with his second wife. Charlotte joined him there with her husband but returned to England at the beginning of 1869 for a holiday, when she became ill and died after a short illness from typhoid fever.

Democratic Party's National Consultative Committee (NCC) elected him as the Leader of Democratic Party of Mongolia in 2008. He worked as the First Deputy Prime Minister of Mongolia in the coalition government of the Mongolian People's Party and Democratic Party of Mongolia in 2008–2012. Previously, he served as the Minister of Agriculture and Industry in 1996–2000 and the Minister of Finance in 2004–2006. He served as senior advisor to the President of Mongolia, Khaltmaagiin Battulga, from 2017 until his resignation in early 2019. Early life Altankhuyag was born in Uvs Province in Mongolia and attended Ulaangom's 1st secondary school from 1966–1976. Then he graduated the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of National University of Mongolia. After the graduation, he was honored to stay as a professor at the university. Political career During the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia, he was one of pioneers in the youth movement. With his colleagues, he initiated the Democratic Socialist Movement. On 21 February 1990, the first meeting to establish the Mongolian Social Democratic Party was held, and he was elected as a member of the party establishing commission. Between 1990–2006, he served as a General Secretary of different political parties four times. He was elected as the Member of Parliament twice. Following the 2008 Mongolian parliamentary election, Democratic Party leader Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj resigned as a result of the party's controversial defeat and Altankhuyag was elected as the Democratic Party's new leader. During his leadership, Democratic Party of Mongolia launched \\"Mongolian People—2020\\" action plan to strengthen the values of democracy and civil society.  Prime Minister of Mongolia (2012–2014)  Following the 2012 Mongolian legislative election, Norovyn Altankhuyag was elected Prime Minister. During his tenure, Altankhuyag sold a large volume of government bonds, and thus was the head of the most wealthy government in Mongolia's history up to that point. As Altankhuyag mentioned in \\"Tsenzurgui Yaria\\", a TV show where celebrities are asked uncensored questions, he said the cause for the economic issues that led to the vote of no-confidence he received on 5 November 2014 was that he did not agree with President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj's views on matters. Though the President of Mongolia has relatively little power, he claimed Elbegdorj strong-armed him on matters of government affairs. He says he's held a grudge against Elbegdorj since.

The band's name is taken from the Allen Ginsberg poem with the same name.  The beginning  The band was formed in 2002 when childhood friends Lars Bendixby, Espen Blystad, Alex Engebretsen and Simen Lund started to play together while attending to the same school outside of Oslo. Through friends and acquaintances, the band came in touch with Knut Frøysnes and Kristian Syvertsen in 2004, and the band's original (and current) line-up was completed. Later the same year, the band debuted as a live act on the well known music scene Mono in Oslo. The band spent the next two years on the road, establishing a reputation as a solid live act and refining their musical expression.  Higher Class Of Lush and record deal with EMI  In 2007, Howl released their debut album Higher Class of Lush on their own label. The album was self-produced in collaboration with Frode Jacobsen from the Norwegian rock band Madrugada. The album got attention from EMI, who re- released the album in 2008. The band was one of the finalists in Årets Urørt in 2008, which is a Norwegian contest for new and upcoming bands. The singles Repeater, Nineteenseventyfive og Silver Equals Gold ended up in high rotation on several Norwegian radio stations, and was one of the most played bands on the Norwegian youth radio station NRK P3 in 2008.\\"Fra Urørt til mest spilt på P3\\" fra nrkp3.no  Second album: Cold Water Music  In April 2009 the band announced that they had entered Kungstenstudios in Gothenborg, Sweden, and had started to record their second album.

A number of potential songs were mentioned, such as Pillow, Weak Sense of Rebellion, Sobriety Hymn and To The Point(Where Nothing Hurts). In May 2009 the band confirmed that they were about to enter the studio again for the second recording session, and that they were aiming to track three or four new songs. Some new song titles were mentioned: Let The Choir Sing, Song For K, Understanding Priorities, Privileged Love Bohemia (formerly known as Controller, which has been played live regularly) and Jubilation Reigns. In September 2009 the band informed that they had been two more times in the studio during the summer, and that they were on their way into the studio for the fifth and hopefully the final recording session. New songs recorded until then was All of This Will Change, Television og Killing Suburbia. The band revealed that their goal was to record 15 brand new songs and select 10 for the album. First single Misdemeanors from the new album was released on January 4, and went straight into rotation on NRK P3 and Radio Tango. It was announced in late January that the album's title was Cold Water Music, and that the album was slated for release on March 8.http://www.rockblogg.no/2010/02/423/ The following track list is now confirmed: #Urgency #Misdemeanors #Sobriety Hymn #Controller #High Hopes #Song For K #Weak Sense Of Rebellion #To The Point #Let The Choir Sing #Dödskalle Cold Water Music is Produced by Mattias Glavå (Håkan Hellström) and mixed by David Bianco ( Bob Dylan, Teenage Fanclub among others).

He was succeeded by his son, either Lakshmadeva or Naravarman.  Ascension  Udaipur, Madhya Pradesh Udayaditya was a brother of Bhoja, the most renowned king of the Paramara dynasty. At the time of Bhoja's death, the Paramara kingdom suffered simultaneous invasions from its Chaulukya and Kalachuri neighbours. Bhoja's successor Jayasimha, possibly his son, appears to have ascended the Paramara throne with the support of the Kalyani Chalukya prince Vikramaditya VI; he was probably dethroned by Vikramaditya's rival brother Someshvara II. After Jayasimha, Udayaditya ascended the Paramara throne.  Reign  The Udaipur Prashasti inscription says that at Bhoja's death \\" Dhara was filled with a dense darkness by his foes and his hereditary warriors become infirm in body. Then arose king Udayaditya, another sun as it were, destroying the dense darkness......and gladdening the sight of his people by his splendour\\". According to the Nagpur inscription, \\"when he(Bhoja) had become Indra's companion, when the realm was overrun by floods in which its sovereign was submerged, his relative Udayaditya become king delivering the earth which was troubled by kings and taken possession of by Karna...... joined by Karnatas.\\" During Udayaditya's reign, Vikramaditya VI - who now held the Kalyani Chalukya throne - invaded the Paramara kingdom, and captured the territory to the south of the Godavari River. Udayaditya repulsed an invasion by the Chaulukya king Karna. He formed matrimonial alliances with his Guhila, Kalachuri, Vaghela, and Chaulukya neighbours to strengthen his position.  Personal life  Udayaditya was Bhoja's brother, as attested by the Jainad inscription, which names Udayaditya as Jagaddeva's father and Bhoja as Jagaddeva's paternal uncle. He had three sons - Lakshmadeva, Naravarman, and Jagddeva; and one daughter - Shyamaladevi. His daughter married the Guhila prince Vijaysinha, and gave birth to Alhandevi, who married the Kalachuri king Gayakarna. Inscriptions recording grants made by and military achievements of both Lakshmadeva and Naravarman have been discovered. According to one theory, Lakshmadeva succeeded Udayaditya on the throne. An alternative view is that Lakshmadeva's grants and military successes happened during the reign of his father, and Naravarman succeeded Udayaditya on the throne. Udayaditya appears to have had the hereditary fondness for literature and art, and to have brought up his sons as scholars, and his son Naravarman is believed to have been the author of more than one Prashasti. Coinage The gold coins issued by Udayaditya are of 4.05 g weight. On the obverse of these coins the image of seated Lakshmi is depicted. On the reverse, the Devanagari legend, Shrimad Udayadeva is inscribed in three lines.Deyell, John S. (1999).

It is dark brown in color with a crown of lavender tentacles and has a length of up to about . Page 31. The worm inhabits the Californian coast, from Sonoma County to northern Baja California. Sandcastle worms live in colonies, building tube reefs somewhat similar to sandcastles (hence the name), which are often seen on rocky beaches at medium and low tide. The sandcastles, which have a honeycomb-like outward appearance, can cover an area of up to on a side. They may share areas with mussel beds and are found in any place that provides some shelter, such as rock faces, overhanging ledges and concave shorelines. The worms remain in their tubes and are almost never seen. At low tide, when above the water, they close the entrance to their tubes with a shield-like operculum made of dark setae. When submerged, they extend their tentacles out of the tube to catch food particles and sand grains. The grains are sorted, with the best ones used to keep the tube in repair, and the rest ejected. The colonies are formed by the gregarious settlement of larvae, which require contact with an existing colony to metamorphose into adult worms. Gregarious settlement of this species has been linked to specific free fatty acids associated with the tubes of adult worms. On rocky beaches, settlement is dependent on larval behavior in the water column and perception of chemical cues when the larvae contact the tubes. Sandcastle worms should not be confused with the similar, but more northern Sabellaria cementarium which are found from Alaska to southern California and have an amber-colored operculum. Unlike P. californica, S. cementarium rarely forms colonies, does not settle gregariously, and its larvae do not respond to free fatty acids. Underwater glue Colony underwater Colony exposed by low tide In 2004, researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) discovered that the glue used by the Phragmatopoma worm to build its protecting tube was made of specific proteins with opposite charges. Those proteins are called polyphenolic proteins that are used as bioadhesives. They succeeded in obtaining the sequence of these adhesive proteins. Inspired by these results University of Utah researchers reported in 2009 that they succeeded in duplicating the glue that the worms secrete and use to stick sand grains together underwater. The typical amount of glue that the worm produces at once is approximately 100 picoliters, requiring 50 million to fill a teaspoon. They believe the glue to have applications as a biocompatible medical adhesive, for instance to repair shattered bones. If found to be practicable, the synthetic glue, which is based on complex coacervates, could be used to fix small bone fragments, instead of metal stabilizer devices such as pins and screws, which are challenging to use. Other potential medical applications include sealing skin cuts, repair of cranio-facial bones, and corneal incisions. Obstacles include ensuring that the bond is to the substrate rather than the surface layer of the water. Another is that in order to cure, glues need to dry out. Most either do not cure underwater or set too quickly. The proteins that are the basis of its adhesive contain side chains of phosphate and amine groups, which are well-known adhesion promoters which probably helps wet the surface. The glue has two parts, with different proteins and side groups in each. The two are made separately in a gland, like an epoxy, and mix as they are secreted. The glue sets in about 30 seconds, probably triggered by the large difference in acidity between the acidic glue and seawater. Curing takes about six hours, as the proteins cross-link, reaching the consistency of shoe leather. Existing medical superglues are highly immunogenic. Initial experiments with the new synthetic on animals show no immune response. But inside the body, the glue needs to eventually degrade, ideally at roughly the same rate as the bone or tissue regrows. Degradable versions therefore include proteins that are broken down by specialized cells. Other species that produce underwater glues include certain species of mussels, oysters, barnacles and caddisfly larvae.

During reviews for the album, \\"Carmen\\" garnered high acclaim from critics, most of whom praised the song's lyrics. Background and composition \\"Carmen\\" was written by Del Rey and Justin Parker, and produced by Emile Haynie with additional production by Jeff Bhasker. In an interview for The Sun, Del Rey revealed that the song was about \\"a doomed woman who sells her body on the streets\\" of Coney Island, which Del Rey viewed as an \\"important [place] to [her]\\" throughout her career in New York City. Del Rey told Complex that the melody and the lyrics of \\"Carmen\\" \\"come together\\": > \\"I was out really late and walking to the tempo of my own rhythm, and then I > just started singing, 'Carmen, Carmen doesn’t have a problem lying to > herself cause her liquor’s top shelf.' And it was an easy cadence. The whole > thing just came, and I think I was in a really good place then, so it was > like things...it was really easy to channel.\\" Critical reception \\"Carmen\\" was acclaimed by most critics for its ability to tell a story and haunt with its intense lyrics of the downside to fame. Noted as a cautionary hint of any downside to such a debauched lifestyle that Del Rey portrays on her album, Andy Gill of The Independent describes the song as a metaphor used by Del Rey for her \\"synthetic life experience.\\" Alex Denney of NME described the song as \\"a winner\\" with Del Rey's richly suggestive tones conjuring the ghosts of Lauren Bacall’s classic femme-fatales.

The video opens with Instagram-style snapshots of New York City, spliced together with scenes of old Hollywood paparazzi, a rose, and shots of Lana herself. Once the song begins, we see a dressed woman working a pole, then Lana on a city porch. The song goes on to feature black and white photo stills, animated food scenes, Lana riding the back of a motorcycle operated by the model Josh Rachlin and multiple references to drugs and troubled youth.

History After 24 months of construction (with a budget of $40,850,000), the school allowed students to attend classes on September 1, 2011. However, the school officially opened on September 22, 2011. École McTavish is named after Douglas Craig McTavish and Cassia McTavish. Douglas Craig McTavish was the first Fort McMurray Public School Board Superintendent. He was hired to build the first school and he literally did that by using logs. After completion, McTavish left but soon returned in 1913 with his bride, Cassia. Cassia, a pioneer in her own right, taught 13 students in the region for five years without pay. In 1914, Mr. McTavish made the first school tax assessment. For his fortitude, Mr. McTavish was later appointed Justice of the Peace. École McTavish's atrium wall features a 20 foot by 14 foot actual 1912 picture of the first log school with Douglas Craig and Cassia McTavish standing beside it. In September 2018 the school expanded to include Grades 10-12, complete with renovations to the current building and a large addition to the existing school totalling $30 million. School Site The core school area is 8804 square meters (94, 768 square feet). The initial capacity is 800 students which doubled to 1600 students with the high school expansion in 2018. The school houses over $750,000 in solar panels, an indoor greenhouse, and outdoor gardens as part of our environmental initiatives. The building also features a theatre with lighting and sound, a state-of-the-art dance studio, three gymnasiums, two separate learning commons areas (one for Grades 7-9 and one for Grades 10-12), welding and automotive facilities, technology suites for animation and coding, culinary arts facilities, and daily hot lunch service. Curriculum The school follows the national curriculum. Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts are the four core subjects. There are also optional courses like robotics, cooking, recreational leadership, music, etc. In the 2017-2018 school year, McTavish's sports teams won 16 out of a possible 20 Junior High City Championships in sports, including basketball, volleyball, badminton, track and field, and cross country. The school's Robotics teams have travelled to international competitions, and have also had great success across Alberta. Their Music programming includes Concert Band, Jazz Band, Glee, Show Choir, Guitar, and annual Musical Productions. The Band and Choir has travelled to Disneyland (2013, 2015), Ottawa and Montreal (2017), Edmonton (2014, 2016, 2018) and New York City (2019). Musical Productions have included Beauty and the Beast Jr. (2012), Annie Jr. (2013), Seussical Jr. (2014), The Wiz (2016), Aladdin Jr. (2017), and Into the Woods (2018).

Background and Career In his own words, captured in documentary, Malarcher's mother was born in slavery. His father was the head workman on a big plantation. He was the youngest of 11 children, and grew up in Union, Louisiana. He started playing baseball at a very young age, and had older brothers also playing baseball, his oldest brother playing on the men's team. Malarcher was attending New Orleans University and playing for the New Orleans Eagles at the age of 22 in 1916 when he was picked up by the Indianapolis ABCs who were traveling back from the winter baseball league in Cuba. The ABCs offered him $50 a month for his first contract. He attended college at Dillard University (formerly New Orleans University).

It provides a range of services to children and families in Ireland, and promotes children's rights. The ISPCC is best known for its free confidential listening service, ISPCC Childline. It also provides a range of support services from its offices around Ireland. Its support line is available daily to anyone in Ireland concerned about a child. The ISPCC was founded as a successor to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children which had operated in Ireland from 1889 to 1956.The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC) , Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, Volume V, Chapter 1 The first Irish branch of the NSPCC was founded in Dublin in May 1889, with branches founded in Cork and Belfast in 1891.  Services  The ISPCC provides a wide range of services. Annually, ISPCC Childline has over 400,000 conversations with children, through its phone, online and webchat services. Childline is a free, anonymous and confidential service, that is available to children 24-hours a day by phone, text, and online web chat. The society publishes an annual report which details the volume and types of calls received and the reasons why children call. History Inspectors Each branch of the NSPCC and ISPCC had an inspector who was paid a salary and was provided with a house that doubled as a local office. Their job was to investigate child abuse or neglect. They were nearly all men and were recruited from the ranks of retired army personnel and police. Each answered to a local committee of volunteers. A brown uniform was worn by inspectors and they were popularly known as \\"cruelty men\\". Inspectors acted independently and were not answerable to the branch committee, though they were answerable to the honorary secretary of the committee, though the onus was on the inspector to communicate with superiors. Social conditions From the 1930s to the 1940s many people lived in squalid conditions. From the 1930s to the 1950s reports by the society graphically described the conditions that people lived in, as well as advocating that children moved from their families live with new families rather than be sent to industrial schools. When John Charles McQuaid became a patron of the society in 1956 the criticism of industrial schools advocacy of adoption and case studies vanished from reports. Membership also changed under McQuaid, who had targeted traditionally Protestant organisations such as the ISPCC and recruited large numbers of Catholics who then gained positions of control. Change in role In 1968 social workers took over the role of inspectors and in 1970 the Health boards took over other functions of the society. Industrial schools Both the NSPCC and ISPCC had a role in committing children to industrial schools, though the exact extend is not clear because of lack of records – the society states that some were lost in a fire in their office in 1961 and some may have been lost in the changeover from the NSPCC in 1956. Frank Duff criticised the society in a letter to John Charles McQuaid in 1941. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse concluded that the society had played an important role in committing children to industrial schools, though the exact extent is unclear as some reports are missing. Poverty was the main reason children were committed to residential care – the idea of supporting families with financial aid was advocated by the society as early as 1951. Funding and expenditure The ISPCC is funded almost 80 per cent from fundraising, both public donations and others. In 2011 the ISPCC had an income of €6.5 million. It spent more than one third of this on fund-raising and promotion. Controversies In 1999 then ISPCC Chief Executive Cian O'Tighearnaigh resigned his post following accusations of fraud in relation to non-payment of commissions to collectors. He gained an injunction barring the DPP from bringing a prosecution against on the grounds that the delay in instituting criminal proceedings had prejudiced him in obtaining a fair trial. In September 2011 an ISPCC advert titled \\"I Can't Wait Until I Grow Up\\" featuring a young boy being repeatedly assaulted by a man was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (ASAI) for breaching rules on gender equality. The ASAI noted that previous adverts by the charity also solely featured male abusers and that \\"the portrayal of only male characters as the abusers was in breach of the provisions of the Code\\". The code states that \\"marketing communications should respect the principle of the equality of men and women\\" and \\"should avoid sex stereotyping and any exploitation or demeaning of men and women\\". The ISPCC technically complied with the ruling by removing the video from its own website but neglected to remove the banned video from YouTube and claimed that the decision would make it difficult for them to produce material on child abuse in future.

In 1801, with the union of Great Britain and Ireland, that house was in turn replaced by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Origins The Parliament of England developed from the Magnum Concilium that advised the English monarch in medieval times. This royal council, meeting for short periods, included ecclesiastics, noblemen, and representatives of the counties (known as \\"knights of the shire\\"). The chief duty of the council was to approve taxes proposed by the Crown. In many cases, however, the council demanded the redress of the people's grievances before proceeding to vote on taxation. Thus, it developed legislative powers.E. Barker, Essays on Government (2nd ed. London: Oxford Press, 1951), pp. 62-63 The first parliament to invite representatives of the major towns was Montfort's Parliament in 1265. At the \\"Model Parliament\\" of 1295, representatives of the boroughs (including towns and cities) were admitted. Thus, it became settled practice that each county send two knights of the shire, and that each borough send two burgesses. At first the burgesses were almost entirely powerless, and while the right to representation of each English county quickly became indisputable, the monarch could enfranchise or disfranchise boroughs at pleasure. Any show of independence by burgesses would thus be likely to lead to the exclusion of their towns from Parliament. The knights of the shire were in a better position, although less powerful than their noble and clerical counterparts in what was still a unicameral Parliament. Development of independence The division of the Parliament of England into two houses occurred during the reign of Edward III: in 1341 the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating in effect an Upper Chamber and a Lower Chamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter. They formed what became known as the House of Commons, while the clergy and nobility became the House of Lords. Although they remained subordinate to both the Crown and the Lords, the Commons did act with increasing boldness. During the Good Parliament of 1376, the Commons appointed Sir Peter de la Mare to convey to the Lords their complaints of heavy taxes, demands for an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticism of the King's management of the military.Chris Given-Wilson, Chronicles: the writing of history in medieval England (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004, , OCLC 59259407), p. 175 The Commons even proceeded to impeach some of the King's ministers. Although Mare was imprisoned for his actions, the benefits of having a single voice to represent the Commons were recognized, and the office which became known as Speaker of the House of Commons was thus created.R. G. Davies, J. H. Denton, & J. S. Roskell, The English Parliament in the Middle Ages (Manchester University Press, 1981, , OCLC 7681359), p. 39 Mare was soon released after the death of King Edward III and in 1377 became the second speaker of the Commons. During the reign of the next monarch, Richard II, the Commons once again began to impeach errant ministers of the Crown. They began to insist that they could control both taxation and public expenditures. Despite such gains in authority, however, the Commons still remained much less powerful than the Lords and the Crown. Interior of the House of Commons In Session by Peter Tillemans, c. 1710 The influence of the Crown was increased by the civil wars of the late fifteenth century, which destroyed the power of the great noblemen. Both houses of Parliament held little power during the ensuing years, and the absolute supremacy of the Sovereign was restored. The domination of the monarch grew further under the House of Tudor in the early sixteenth century as Henry VII grew fiscally independent. The Reformation Parliament, called by Henry VIII after Cardinal Wolsey failed to secure a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and sitting from 1529 to 1536 made laws affecting all aspects of national life, but especially with regard to religious matters previously reserved to the church. Though acting at the behest and under the direction of the King and his leading minister, Thomas Cromwell, Parliament was acquiring universal legal competence and responsibility for all matters affecting the realm. When the House of Stuart came to the English throne in 1603, the dependence of the Crown on Parliament for sufficient revenue to fund the operations of government returned as an issue and point of leverage. The first two Stuart monarchs, James I and Charles I, provoked conflicts with the Commons over issues such as taxation, religion, and royal powers. The differences between Charles I and Parliament were great, and resulted in the English Civil War, in which the armed forces of Parliament were victorious. In December 1648 the House of Commons was purged by the New Model Army, which was supposed to be subservient to Parliament. Pride's Purge was the only military coup in English history. Subsequently, Charles I was beheaded and the Upper House was abolished. The unicameral Parliament that remained was later referred to by critics as the Rump Parliament, as it consisted only of a small selection of Members of Parliament approved by the army - some of whom were soldiers themselves. In 1653, when leading figures in this Parliament began to disagree with the army, it was dissolved by Oliver Cromwell. However, the monarchy and the House of Lords were both restored with the Commons in 1660. The influence of the Crown had been decreased, and was further diminished after James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Bill of Rights 1689 was enacted.

Lärka's prime concern was to document the peasant culture that he understood was beginning to disappear, and especially the culture of the lands around lake Siljan in Dalarna; one with agriculture, forestry and many people with stories about older times. Most of his photography was done from 1916 to 1934, and he combined it with lecture tours about the countryside of Siljan. He also documented many of the stories elderly people in the villages told him and was very active in the Swedish local heritage movement that started in the 1920s. More than 4,200 of his photographic plates are today in the municipal archive of Mora.  Karl Lärka as photographer  Village street in Östnor, the doorway of Rombogården to the right. Photo: Karl Lärka/Mora Bygdearkiv.Karl Lärka's photographs are characterized by his concern to document a disappearing culture. People, animals, and buildings are portrayed in their own context. The people cultivate the land, work in the forest, build houses, wash clothes, cook, or pose with working horses. He describes weddings, people, interiors, transhumance, and village streets with a great sense of feeling for composition and quality. Many of Lärka's portraits are typically documentary. People are portrayed in their daily chores, often in positions and with attributes they chose themselves.Per Wirtén, in Romson, p. VIII They differ significantly from the studio portraits of that time, in which people often dressed up and posed. With his connection to the Swedish labour movement, Lärka was known as a \\"democratic photographer\\".Per Wirtén, in Romson, p. IX He let people decide for themselves what to wear, how they wanted to stand, and whether or not they should smile or not. The documentary work procedure of Lärka is also shown in his recording of older people's stories, a method he combined with his photography.Per Wirtén, in Romson, p. VII–VIII During his photographic career, Lärka experienced great developments in photographic technique. In the early days of the 20th century he used photographic plates, like all other serious photographers. He got his first box camera during his time at a folk high school. Later he changed for a larger-format American camera acquired from a retailer who had bought it for photographing thieves in his shop at Sollerön.Per Wirtén, in Romson, p. I Lärka experimented with mixtures of magnesium and potassium permanganate for flashSandström, p. 75 and did \\"reverted\\" enlargements before enlargers arrived, by illuminating photographic paper through the camera lens. Later, when he had access to an enlarger, Lärka copied his pictures onto fine-grain film to be able to show his pictures in his skioptikon (an early form of slide projector) at his lectures.Sandström, p. 79 The large plates were heavy, and when they were exposed, Lärka was forced to find a dark space and reload. When the first sheet film arrived, his work was made easier and there was no longer any risk that the light would disappear while reloading, which sometimes had happened before. One of his cameras was an American large format camera, made for 13×18 in (33×46 cm) plates, equipped with separate shutter (Thornton- Pickard Snap-Shot, 1–1/80 sec), Aplanat B no 4 lens from E Suter (Basel) and separate Waterhouse stop (1:4 or 1:8).Sandström, p. 27 He also used three smaller folding cameras for the format 10×15 cm. In later life, when he no longer photographed professionally, he got a modern camera for 135 film and took both color and black-and-white photos.Sandström, p. 77  Childhood and youth  Karl Lärka was born in 1892 in the village of Gruddbo at Sollerön in Dalarna, Sweden. When he was thirteen he was taught by Uno Stadius, who had a folk high school at Sollerön and told Lärka the importance of documenting everything he observed regarding culture and history.Sandström, p. 40–41 The Lärka family had economic troubles which led to the suicide of Jöns Lärka, Karl's father, in 1906. This struck Karl Lärka particularly hard since he had to help support the family by forestry and farm work.Johansson, p. 14 Thus it was only after his military service that Lärka had a chance to think about his own future. He dreamt of becoming a builder and was a capable draughtsman, but there was no money for any higher education. Instead he started his education at the Bachmans school for handicraft in Hedemora. There he got to know the district court judge Lars Trotzig, who understood Lärka's talent and tried to help him get a scholarship for an education in civil engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.Sandström, p. 42Karl Lärka and Johan Öhman at the folk high school of Brunnsvik, 1915. Photo: Karl Lärka/Mora Bygdearkiv. Thanks to his contacts with Trotzig and later on Anders Zorn, Lärka got the opportunity to work with some building restoration projects. He documented many, among them the restoration of Zorns Gammelgård. He never got the chance to become a civil engineer, as Trotzig never succeeded in getting him a scholarship. Instead, he took winter courses at the folk high school of Brunnsvik in 1915–1917 and became good friends with his classmate Dan Andersson.Sandström, p. 61 Inspired by another classmate, Johan Öhman, Lärka started photographing the peasant culture at Sollerön. He did this with Öhman and initially with Öhman's camera, but by charging his classmates for portraits, Lärka could afford the first camera of his own, a simple Agfa.  Photography projects and lecture tours  After his education at Brunnsvik, Lärka started working on commission as a documentary photographer. In 1919 he was engaged by the local history association of Dalarna to document people in the village of Finngruvan in Venjan, Dalarna. The project was part of a racial study of a kind then regarded as scientific. Little is known about Lärka's own opinions about such studies. It is known that he was not that interested in the categorizing of the people of Dalarna in different groups according to their skulls, and preferred to listen to the stories of the old men.Per Wirtén, in Romson, p. III He was known for having no respect for representatives of the authorities,Johansson, p. 22 and took a well-known photograph of Dan Andersson while Andersson was making a fool of the Stockholm ethnologists in the project. Lärka tried to get the Nordic Museum interested in making an inventory of the parish of Sollerön and tried to get funds to gather his notes and photos. He did not succeed in any of this. Lärka became recognized as a good photographer, but his commitment to preserving and documenting the culture of the lands around lake Siljan was first recognized many years later. By this time, Lärka started his lecture tours. They started as picture shows for friends and others in the villages around Siljan, with the help of a so-called sciopticon.Sandström, p. 46 It was the first time many in the audience had experienced any of the forerunners of cinema. After a while the activity grow larger and Lärka's lecture tours were included in tours organised from Stockholm, with many lecturers involved. Lärka lectured during 1920 all over Sweden, often dressed in Sollerö costume and sometimes together with the folk musician Axel Myrman.Sandström, p. 24 At the same time, Lärka still documented, both in writing and photos, his home district on his own initiative.fäbodar, 1920. Photo: Karl Lärka/Mora Bygdearkiv. In 1924 he assisted Gustaf Ankarcrona in photographing old wall-paintings in Dalarna. The whole work was supposed to result in an exhibition and a book, but Ankarcrona became ill during the inventory trip and never fully recovered; as a consequence, the book was never printed. The material was eventually published in Svante Svärdström's doctoral thesis from 1949Svante Svärdström, Dalmålningarna och deras förlagor: en studie i folklig bildgestaltning 1770-1870 (diss. Lund University; Nordiska museets handlingar, ISSN 0346-8585; 33), Stockholm, 1949. Lärka's colour photographs were made by separation negatives, because colour film was not widely known.  Marriage and the burial grounds at Sollerön  Until 1926, Karl Lärka lived in the Lärka House at Sollerön. In 1925 he married Svea Romson, and the following year they moved to Rombo House in Östnor, owned by Svea's father, Erik Romson.Sandström, p. 29 Lärka continued with his lecturing, which was not regarded as a respectable occupation by all the villagers. A married man should be home working on his farm, was the general opinion. Karl Lärka's parents-in-law passed on in the 1930s and he and his wife became thereby fully responsible for Rombo Farm, a comparatively large farm with many dairy cows, horses, pigs, goats, and arable land. The couple were childless and therefore the niece and nephews from Hofors were welcome guests during summer. They also accompanied Karl and Svea Lärka and the farm animals to the summer pasture farms, which still was used. One of these was the cottage at Klikten. During the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s Karl Lärka and his wife managed the farm on their own, in the later years often without help and often with very little money. Sometimes it was a struggle, and Lärka's ingeniousness was probably a good help. In the early years he often built much of his photo equipment himself, and this experience was also useful in farming.Sandström, p. 57–58 The Lärka cottage at Kliktbåck, Sollerön. Photo: Karl Lärka/Mora Bygdearkiv.As the great burial ground from the Viking Age was discovered at Sollerön in 1928, Karl Lärka became very engaged in investigating and preserving it for future generations. The burial ground was located just a stone's throw from the cottage he and Svea had built for themselves at Klikten in Sollerön. Lärka spent a lot of time trying to preserve the burial ground from the destruction due to farming and stone- clearing operations.Sandström, p. 29–31 During the 1930s Lärka's camera was broken, and he had no funds to get a new one.Wirtén, Per, in Romson, p. VI The work at their farm, his engagement for the burial ground, and the couple's poor incomes meant there was neither money nor time for Karl Lärka to go on photographing. But he did preserve his darkroom over the years.Sandström, p. 56  Distinctions  *1926 – The Artur Hazeliusmedal of the Nordic Museum, in bronze *1956 – The medal of Dalarnas Fornminnes - och Hembygdsförbund *1966 – The plaque of The Society of Caretaking of The Heritage *1972 – Silver medal of The Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities *2000 – Named one of the premier photographers of the former century, by the Swedish photo magazine \\"Foto\\"  Exhibitions  *1964 – The Zorn Museum, Mora *1968 – The W-68 exhibition in Rättvik *1975 – Exhibition in Oslo *1980 – The Trustee Savings Bank in Ludvika *1981 – Posthumous Exhibition in Paris *1992 – The House of Culture in Mora *2001–2002 – The Zorn Museum, Mora *2002 – The House of Culture in Mora *2004 – Kulturhuset in Stockholm  Bibliography  Examples of printed work Karl Lärka contributed to: *Budkavlen (1919) *Med Dalälven från källorna till havet av KE Forslund, delarna Mora och Siljan.

She is the author of over fifty scientific papers, mainly on diarrhoeal and nutritional conditions in children. She served as President of the International Paediatric Association. In her long career, she became known as a strong voice in the fight to improve the health of children. Minister of Health On 25 July 2007, Adenike Grange was appointed the Minister of Health of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the first female Minister of Health. On 9 November 2007, Professor Adenike Grange gave the Lancet Lecture at the UCL Centre for International Health & Development. She said \\"There is enough in terms of knowledge initiatives, strategies, tools, drugs and treatment protocols to cure disease and prolong life, but the reality is that the systems designed to bring about these outcomes are inadequate at best or even non-existent. This is a global problem.\\" She described work in Nigeria to standardise approaches to health delivery and emulate best practice from other countries. Priorities included eradicating polio, controlling malaria, reducing maternal mortality, and reducing levels of disease in the most vulnerable groups. In January 2008, at an event attended by the President's wife Turai Umar Musa Yar'Adua, Adenike Grange urged the first lady to draw national attention to the importance of the health related Millennium Development Goals. She called on the National Assembly to expedite passage of the national health bill, and called on the wives of State Governors to push for laws to promote the well-being of women and children. Resignation and prosecution In February 2008, Adenike Grange was arrested on the orders of President Umaru Yar'Adua over the handling of N300 million of unspent funds in the 2007 budget and award of contracts, and was examined by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). She claimed that she had been misadvised by her directors. The President had reportedly directed that all unspent money in the budget be returned, but it was allegedly shared by officials of the Health Ministry as bonuses. In March 2008, President Yar'Adua accepted the resignation of Adenike Grange. In March 2008, the Nigerian Medical Association (NEC) noted with deep regrets the developments that had culminated in the resignation of Adenike Grange. The NEC acknowledged the integrity, sincerity and commitment to duty of Adenike Grange, her contributions to the care of millions of Nigerian Children and her efforts in her short stay at the Federal Ministry of Health. In April 2008, an Abuja high court ordered that she be remanded in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Senator Iyabo Obasanjo-Bello, daughter of former president Olusegun Obasanjo, was also charged but did not appear in court. In December 2009, a Court of Appeal sitting in https://www.ipa-world.org/ , in a unanimous verdict, ordered that Professor Grange should not stand further trial. She was discharged from facing prosecution and all charges were quashed. Life after Resignation Prof. Adenike Grange went back fully into her commitment to promote maternal and child health as she took up the challenge of heading one of Nigeria's best Pediatric Hospitals, Otunba Tunwase National Pediatric Centre which she helped establish and has since been handed over to the University College Hospital, Ibadan as a way of upgrading the standards of the hospital. she introduced several development initiatives which has helped the hospital grow tremendously. one of the most prolific initiatives she introduced is the Local Health Insurance Scheme for the people of Ijebu Land who couldn't afford to pay for quality health and through this insurance scheme, several people in the community were able to access the services of the hospital. She has since been very active through the Global Alliance for Vaccination and the e. With the help of one of Nigeria's most famous Youth Activists and a youth development expert, Abayomi Mighty, she launched AdeGrange Child Foundation, an NGO committed to promoting the well being of mothers and children through strategic advocacy programmes.

David Balls of Digital Spy described it \\"a fuzzed-up pop thumper\\". The song is composed of \\"thick\\" beats, \\"sexy\\" verses and \\"raunchy\\" lyrics. The chorus features a chanted 'da-da-da' hook, which according to Al Fox of BBC Music is evocative of the group's 2003 single \\"Hole in the Head\\". Andy Gill of The Independent noted that the song sees the Sugababes \\"effectively subjugated to the status of accessories\\"; lyrically, the singers compare themselves to a tie, watch and shoes of a man's outfit. During the pre-hook, group member Heidi Range sings, \\"I\\"m just a pretty little thing / That'll make you wanna sing / Make you wanna buy a ring\\". \\"Wear My Kiss\\" is reminiscent of songs performed by British girl group Girls Aloud and American recording artist Lady Gaga. Release In September 2009, speculation arose that group member Amelle Berrabah had left the Sugababes following reports of tension with band member Keisha Buchanan. However, it was announced on 21 September 2009 that Buchanan, the sole original member of the group, had officially left the Sugababes. Buchanan clarified the departure on her official Twitter account, writing: \\"I'm sad to say that I am no longer a part of the Sugababes ... Although it was not my choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things.\\" Buchanan was replaced by former Eurovision contestant Jade Ewen. As a result of the line-up change, \\"Wear My Kiss\\" was re-recorded for the inclusion of vocals from new member Ewen and the removal of vocals from Buchanan. In October 2009, it was reported that \\"Wear My Kiss\\" would be released as the third single from Sweet 7 on 8 February 2010. The song was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 21 February 2010 as a digital download, and as a CD single the following day. During an interview with David Balls of Digital Spy, group member Heidi Range explained the reason for the song's release as the album's third single, saying: \\"It's had a really good response from radio and our fans on the website. It's also quite appropriate as it comes out around Valentine's Day – there's a lot of kissing going on then!\\" \\"Wear My Kiss\\" was remixed by the British music production team 7th Heaven. Reception Critical response \\"Wear My Kiss\\" received mixed reviews from critics. BBC Music's Al Fox described it as \\"a glimmer of brilliance\\" amongst the album's other tracks. Alice Wyllie of The Scotsman and David Balls of Digital Spy called the song radio-friendly, while the latter described it as \\"more comfortably more Sugababes-sounding\\" than the group's previous two singles, \\"Get Sexy\\" and \\"About a Girl\\". Balls praised the hook as one that \\"lodges in your brain like shrapnel\\". A writer from Daily Record shared a similar opinion, writing: \\"The big chanted hook won't go away once it's in your head\\". Andy Gill of The Independent regarded \\"Wear My Kiss\\" as one of the album's better tracks and noted that it practices \\"a craven form of extreme self-objectification\\". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian noted that while the album was significantly Americanised, \\"Wear My Kiss\\" had \\"escaped with some quirky Britishness intact\\". Khaleej Times wrote that the song proves the Sugababes are \\"feisty and seductive as ever\\" and elaborated, \\"the cut-glass industrialism of the backing track belies the dedication of the trio to the permanent touchpoints of pop music\\". Johnny Dee of Virgin Media named it one of Sweet 7's standout tracks but in contrary felt that \\"trimmed of their former member's vocals could be by absolutely anyone\\". Gavin Martin of Daily Mirror called the song a \\"sweaty but uninspired thumper\\". A critic from The Visitor regarded \\"Wear My Kiss\\" as \\"limp\\" in comparison to the group's older material which he described as \\"feisty, sassy pop\\". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music gave the song a two-out-of-five star rating, and criticised the lack of cohesiveness between the group's vocals, as well as the formulaic nature of the song. Commercial performance \\"Wear My Kiss\\" debuted and peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart for the issue dated 6 March 2010, with sales of 38,209. It became the group's third consecutive top ten single and eighteenth top ten single overall. Sweet 7 also became the first Sugababes album since Taller in More Ways (2005) to produce three top ten singles. The song debuted and peaked at number nine on the Irish Singles Chart, becoming the Sugababes' ninth top ten single in Ireland. \\"Wear My Kiss\\" debuted at number four on the Scottish Singles Chart for the issue dated 6 March 2010. The song debuted and peaked at number 47 on the Czech Singles Chart, where it charted for eight weeks. It was less successful on the Slovakian Singles Chart and peaked at number 73. The song's commercial performance throughout Europe allowed it to appear on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, where it peaked at number 27. Music video Heidi Range dances with clones of herself during the music video. The music video for \\"Wear My Kiss\\" was directed by Martin Weisz during December 2009. Weisz also directed the music video for the group's previous single \\"About a Girl\\". The video for \\"Wear My Kiss\\" was expected to premiere in early January 2010, although a preview was released on 11 January 2010 instead. The video was released on the iTunes Store on 12 March 2010. The green screen was used to produce it, in which the Sugababes stood in front of a projection of their computer-generated images. All three members wore similar blue, pink and red dresses. It primarily focuses on Sugababes dancing in front of a crowd of clones of themselves. Ewen discussed the experiences while filming the music video with First News, saying: The music video begins with Amelle Berrabah singing the first verse, in which objects appear in the background in reference to the lyrics, including a gold tie and silver watch. When Range sings the lines \\"make you wanna buy a ring\\" a diamond appears in the background. During the chorus, clones of members of the band appear as they are dancing. During Ewen's verse, her reference to shoes prompts a pair of green high heels to emerge in the background. The group begins dancing together in the chorus while clones of them appear again. The video ends with Sugababes dancing while making hand gesture to represent a \\"kiss\\". Ann Lee of Metro described the video as \\"futuristic\\". Nick Levine from Digital Spy praised the video as an \\"absolute cracker\\". Live performances The Sugababes promoted \\"Wear My Kiss\\" on 26 January 2010 with three appearances on television. The following day, the trio performed it at the Fight Cervical Cancer in Style concert. A writer from Belfast Telegraph described their performance as \\"highly energetic\\". Fight Cervical Cancer in Style, a charity fundraising event, was held at Koko in London by Jo's Trust to raise awareness about the prevalence of cervical cancer among women. Berrabah spoke about the importance of this health issue on stage: The band performed \\"Wear My Kiss\\" during a gig in March 2010 at the Supperclub, London. A journalist from Daily Star wrote, \\"In her super-mini sequin dress, giraffe- legged Jade Ewen naturally slots in, just like newest single 'Wear My Kiss' does to the Sugababes' back catalogue\\". They performed the song on BBC's Eurovision: Your Country Needs You on 12 March 2010. The song was performed immediately prior to the winner of the show being announced. The Sugababes performed \\"Wear My Kiss\\" at Chester Rocks on 2 July 2011 as part of a set list, which included their number one singles \\"Freak like Me\\", \\"Hole in the Head\\" and \\"Push the Button\\".

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Kuleto had designed nearly 400 restaurants as of late 2009, including some of the most popular fine dining restaurants in the United States. Biography Kuleto has no formal interior design education. He was born and grew up in La Crescenta, an unincorporated suburb of Los Angeles. The son of a building contractor, he often built things for himself as a child, including a large play fort with indoor plumbing when he was ten. He left home at age 18 in a camper he had built. He started in the restaurant business as a busboy, then rose to the positions of waiter and cook. Upon settling in Tahoe City he found work as a carpenter and building contractor to remodel restaurants. When the contractor business was slow he offered to design several steakhouses for William McCormick's Refectory Steakhouse chain for free in exchange for serving as the general contractor for construction. By age 28 he had designed 60 restaurants, including 20 Refectory Steakhouses. Kuleto was married to Shannon. Their son Daniel was born in 1996. In September 2011, he married the former Jennifer Astrup. Projects Design style Fog City Diner in San Francisco, CaliforniaKuleto's work does not fit a specific school of design, and is often described as being heavily themed and unique to him. His projects are known for \\"whimsical\\" features, and use of expensive, hand-crafted ornamental materials. He says he finds inspiration in many real-life objects, situations, books, places, and landscapes. Most feature multiple dining rooms, a large bar that Kuleto describes as an \\"altar\\" that \\"legitimizes the drinking experience\\", and an \\"exhibition kitchen\\" so that diners can watch their food being cooked. Kuleto's design process is often extemporaneous, rather than fully planned at the beginning of a project. He usually creates a fictional story about each location, imagining an old invented history. As an example, Epic Roasthouse is imagined as (and is close to the real-life location of) a pump house that was proposed but never built as a backup fire protection system in San Francisco, and would likely have prevented most of the destruction from the fires caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which ruptured most of the cities primary water mains. The restaurant is the pump house that would have saved the city. Restaurants Kuleto is considered \\"one of the West Coast's most sought-after restaurant designers\\". Generally large, expensive, and independently owned, restaurants he has built have tended to be successful. Kuleto's 110th design, the Fog City Diner on San Francisco's Embarcadero, built in 1985 to resemble an American diner, is generally credited as Kuleto's first project to gain critical attention and widespread popularity. As of 1989, 122 of the 125 restaurants he had designed so far had lasted more than 5 years. Boulevard, which opened in 1993 at a cost of $2.3 million repaid its initial investors within three years and as of 2008 was the second highest grossing independent restaurant in San Francisco, and 59th in the United States. One restaurant that did not last five years was a branch of Carnegie Deli in Beverly Hills, California, which opened in 1989 at a cost of $4 million, financed and run by oil billionaire Marvin Davis in response to Davis' belief that existing delis in California were of low quality. Davis' unwise business decisions and micromanagement of the restaurant are credited as causes of the decline of the restaurant, which went out of business in 1993. Other projects include Splendido (which closed in 2001) in San Francisco, Buckhead Diner in Atlanta, and Papagus in Chicago. Restaurants in which Kuleto served as designer and co-owner include Jardinière (with chef Traci Des Jardins), San Francisco's Postrio (with Wolfgang Puck), Farallon (an \\"undersea fantasy\\" with Mark Franz), Epic Roasthouse (with Jan Birnbaum), Waterbar (also with Mark Franz), Boulevard (a belle époque design in an 1889 brick building that survived the 1906 earthquake, with Nancy Oakes), Kuleto's, McCormick & Kuleto's (a joint project with the McCormick & Schmick's restaurant group at the site of the former Maxwell's Plum), all in San Francisco, and Martini House in Napa Valley (with Todd Humphries). Other projects In the dining room at Nick's Cove, in Tomales Bay, CaliforniaAfter making wine for 25 years, Kuleto established the Kuleto Estate Family Winery on an property in Napa Valley. He purchased the estate in 1992 as a replacement for his old home, which had burned down, and spent the next five years building a home there, which he called Villa Cucina. Although he began growing grapes on the ranch in 1993, and made his own wine, he had not opened up a commercial winery. Construction of the new winery began in 1999 and ended in 2003. As of 2005 the winery was producing 7,500 cases per year of wine, which it sold in the range of $20 to $50 per bottle, from of grapes. Kuleto served as owner, builder, designer, and co-winemaker. He also raises livestock and farms fish, produce and olives on the property, most of which are processed for private events held on the property. In 2009 Kuleto sold a controlling interest in the wine business (but only a small portion of the grounds and vineyards) to a small wine conglomerate run by financier William P. Foley, who planned to increase production to more than 14,000 cases per year. In 2000 Kuleto bought the Nick's Cove & Cottages, in the isolated unincorporated town of Nick's Cove, between Marshall, California and Tomales, California along the beach at Tomales Bay in Marin County north of San Francisco. He restored the property to a rustic 1930s appearance at a cost of $14 million, then reopened it in 2007 as an inn of twelve cabins and 130-seat restaurant. The 8-year project involved environmental mitigation (the restaurant's kitchen is above a stream bed; the California red-legged frog, an endangered species, was discovered on the property during construction), restoration of dilapidated building, and a fishing pier. Nick's Cove re-opened just as the Great Recession was beginning. Saddled with the burden of $13 million in debt during a time of economic insecurity, the venture was unable to become profitable. In a letter to investors, Kuleto said that the venture had been a \\"complete disaster,\\" with the result being a \\"complete loss of your financial investment.\\" Kuleto's own losses were $5 million. The business was sold to Prescott Ashe of Golden Gate Capital in 2011, and is still in operation.

These cases were from Maharashtra (488 cases), Gujarat (77 cases), Karnataka (46 cases), Uttar Pradesh (10 cases), Madhya Pradesh (4 cases) and New Delhi (68 cases). There are no reports of cases being exported to other countries.  Cause  A committee under chairmanship of Professor Vulimiri Ramalingaswami was formed by the Government of India to investigate the plague episode. In 1995, the committee submitted the report \\"The Plague Epidemic of 1994\\" to the government of India. The report concluded that the disease was plague, but did not identify the origin. Other sources identify the ultimate cause as the 1993 Latur earthquake,1994 Surat plague has many lessons for India on how to beat coronavirus which caused a large number of homes to be abandoned with food grains inside. This destabilized the population of domestic and wild rats (in which the plague is endemic), allowing transmission of the plague from wild rats to domestic rats to people.Saxena, Vijay K., and T. Verghese. \\"Ecology of Flea-Transmitted Zoonotic Infection in Village Mamla, District Beed\\". Current Science, vol. 71, no. 10, 1996, pp. 800–802. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24098741. Accessed 1 July 2020. The World Health Organization collected reports of excessive rat deaths in Malma in the Beed district of Maharashtra on 5 August 1994, followed by complaints of fleas. After three weeks, WHO received reports of suspected bubonic plague in Malma, followed by other villages and districts.WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.2 Plague ManualEpidemiology, Distribution, Surveillance and Control, p. 35 Flooding in Surat, which had open sewers, put the bodies of many dead rats on the street, which residents probably came into contact with. The Ganesh Chaturthi festival created crowds in the city shortly thereafter, promoting the spread of pneumonic plague, which was declared on 21 September. By the end of the outbreak, an estimated 78% of confirmed cases were in the slums of Surat. Panic in Surat In the first week of August 1994 health officials reported unusually large numbers of deaths of domestic rats in Surat city of Gujarat state. On 21 September 1994 the Deputy Municipal Commissioner of Health (DMCH) for Surat city received a report that a patient had died seemingly due to pneumonic plague. The DMCH of Surat alerted medical officers in the area where the patient had died. Later that day, a worried caller informed DMCH about 10 deaths in Ved Road residential area and around 50 seriously ill patients admitted to the hospital. News of the plague spread through Surat city through the night of 21 September 1994. Ill-prepared, medical shops quickly exhausted stocks of tetracycline. This led to panic with people fleeing hospitals fearing infection from other sick patients. This triggered the biggest post- independence migration of people in India with around 300,000 people leaving Surat city in 2 days, for fear of illness or of being quarantined.  Confusion over disease identification  Initial questions about whether it was an epidemic of plague arose because the Indian health authorities were unable to culture Yersinia pestis, but this could have been due to lack of sophisticated laboratory equipment. Yet there are several lines of evidence strongly suggesting that it was a plague epidemic: blood tests for Yersinia were positive, a number of individuals showed antibodies against Yersinia and the clinical symptoms displayed by the affected were all consistent with the disease being plague. About 6,000 cases of fever were misidentified as plague, adding to panic and confusion. Villagers in Rajasthan reportedly tried to exterminate rats, which might have lead to more cases as fleas would have to abandon rat hosts for humans.  Economic impact and hygiene improvements Tourism was negatively affected, flights to India were cancelled, and some planes from India were fumigated at airports. Many flights from India to the nearby Gulf region were suspended. Some countries also put a hold on the imports from India. Paramilitary forces set up checkpoints to deal with people fleeing Surat. Panic buying and government-ordered closures spread to Mumbai and Delhi.The Surat Plague and its Aftermath Economic damage in Surat was estimated at ₹816 crore (₹8.160 billion). The city implemented massive infrastructure improvements, tearing down slums, covering sewers, constructing public pay toilets, and implementing fines for littering. It also improved its plans for emergency travel advisories, and fired some corrupt officials and disciplined ineffective city workers, including street sweepers. By 1996, the city was judged the cleanest in India.  References   External links  * * * Christopher Wills. Plagues, their Origin, History, and Future.

Work  In his installations Kuśmirowski showcases his ability to craft replicas for illusionistic effects of decay and ageing, often bringing together found objects with elements constructed out of wood, cardboard, paint and other materials.Christy Lange, Robert Kusmirowski Frieze Magazine, Issue 99, May 2006. Kuśmirowski had become interested in replication and falsification as a child when he forged bus passes and postage stamps for his family. This has remained a consistent theme in his work.Frieze: Robert Kusmirowski In 2003, he rode from Paris via Luxemburg to Leipzig on a 19th-century bicycle, dressed in period garb. He documented the tour by photographing it, and processed the prints so that they seem to be original photos from the time period. He presented the photographs in an exhibition space, along with an unusable reproduction of the bicycle and his own drawings, which were yellowed in order to simulate newspaper articles on the various stages of the tour.Robert Kusmirowski, edited by Yilmaz Dziewior Hatje Cantz Publishing.

It is used in spectroscopic measurements where the frequency of the excitation light is varied, and the luminescence is monitored at the typical emission frequency of the material being studied. Peaks in the PLE spectra often represent absorption lines of the material. PLE spectroscopy is a useful method to investigate the electronic level structure of materials with low absorption due to the superior signal-to-noise ratio of the method compared to absorption measurements. Physical process In a quantum- mechanical description of matter, the electrons confined to a material (such as those in individual atoms, molecules or crystals) are limited to a discrete set of energy values. The ground state of such a material system is such that the most energetic electron has its minimal energy. In photoluminescence, energy is transferred from light incident on the material and absorbed to electrons. The light is absorbed in minimal \\"quanta\\" or \\"packets\\" of energy of the electromagnetic radiation called photons. The amount of energy carried by a photon is proportional to its frequency. The electron is then in an excited state of higher energy. Such states are not stable and with time the material system will return to its ground state and the electron will lose its energy. Luminescence is the process whereby light is emitted when the electron drops to a lower energy level. Often when a photon is absorbed, the system is excited in the corresponding excited state, then it relaxes in an intermediate lower energy state, with a \\"non-radiative relaxation\\" (a relaxation that doesn't involve the emission of a photon, but e.g. involves the emission of vibrational energy) and then there is the emission of a photon with a lower energy than the absorbed one, because of the relaxation from the intermediate, lower energy state to the \\"ground state\\". Usually the strongest luminescence of the material is from the lower levels to the ground state. This process is called fluorescence. For instance, in semiconductors, most of the light emitted is at the frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy, i.e. from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band. In such systems, more light absorbed by the material, results in more electrons decaying non- radiatively to the lower states, and more luminescence in the emission wavelength.

It does this by supporting world-class basic research, hosting multi-disciplinary workshops and conferences, and providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and best practice across all parts of the UK’s cerebral palsy (CP) sector. On 4 November 2009, Lord Hameed, the charity's president, tabled a motion in the House of Lords asking the Government what measures have been taken to prevent cerebral palsy which now costs the NHS £4 billion every year.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91104-gc0003.htm#091104114000035 The total annual cost of brain disorders (covering 19 groups of disorders) has been estimated to be €798 billion for the EU alone. 'Cost of Disorders of the Brain in Europe' European Neuropsychopharmacology (2011) 21, 718–779 In September 2020, the William Little Foundation published \\"Cerebral Palsy: causes and prevention\\", a review of the state of CP research around the world, highlighting work that significantly enhanced our understanding CP but also identifying gaps in research activity where it was felt resources could be applied that would accelerate our ability to combat this devastating condition. Much of this concern centres on the commonly-held view of CP as a comparatively ‘rare’ condition, meaning that research investment is significantly less than for conditions with higher incidence and prevalence. While CP’s incidence is estimated to afflict between 1.5 and 4 babies in every 1,000, no one knows this for certain as there are no universally consistent means of diagnosing CP or reporting its incidence in either the developed or developing worlds. This ‘rarity’ argument also ignores the disproportionate social cost that is CP’s legacy: the condition is lifelong and frequently involves 24-hour care for those affected. National social-/health-care budgets and those of medical insurance companies for those not supported by a national health service continue to be stretched by the need for ever-increasing provision: CP costs the UK alone well over £1.6 billion every year. Yet the amount invested annually on research by government and other charities is worryingly small: the figure for the UK is less than £5 million, 0.23% of research funding. The UK is not alone in this – the report also reveals a similar picture of cost : investment disparity globally.

Located about 80 km from Punjab's capital of Lahore, it covers an area of 835 hectares (2000 acres) and has become the destination for over one million pilgrims a year. Mariamabad began in 1892. Observing the misery and oppression of the newly converted Christians in the district of Sialkot, Capuchin Bishop Van Den Bosch purchased of government land for 650,000 rupees (US$29,545) for Christians to live and work on. In 1893, three priests and three Christian families moved to the land. Pilgrims travel by foot, bullock carts, bicycles, buses and trucks to Mariamabad. The shrine also houses the Church of St. Mary and St. Joseph established by Belgian Capuchins on December 8, 1898. A prominent feature of the shrine is the Marian grotto on a hill where a three-and-a-half-meter statue of Mary stands. There are stalls selling religious posters and cards, crosses, rosaries, candles, incense sticks and other religious objects, as well as cold drinks, food and sweets to cater to the pilgrims that travel from all over Pakistan and even overseas. On September 10, 2005, armed men waiting near the village stopped buses bringing pilgrims and robbed the passengers of their valuables.

Early life and military career Augustus Magee was born in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1809, he graduated third in his class at West Point. Magee served as an artillery officer under Major General James Wilkinson at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and then at Fort Jesup under future president Zachary Taylor. He was effective but harsh in his treatment of settlers and outlaws, in the disputed Neutral Ground between the Arroyo Hondo and the Sabine River. Magee was recommended for promotion to a higher rank, but refused the promotion. Frustrated with his prospects in the army, he considered Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara's plan to support the Mexican War of Independence via an invasion of Spanish Texas from American soil, even though this proposal defied the Neutrality Act. Magee resigned his army commission in June 1812 and personally recruited many of the soldiers for a military filibustering expedition, taking the rank of colonel alongside Gutiérrez. Filibuster Leaving Natchitoches with 130 men on August 2, 1812, the group crossed the Sabine six days later. On August 10, Magee was joined by General Gutiérrez; on the 16th, the force entered Nacogdoches. The army, now swollen to about 300 soldiers, occupied Santísima Trinidad de Salcedo (now Trinidad, Texas) on the Trinity River, in mid-September. It was here that Magee became ill. Some sources attribute this to consumption or malaria, but the papers of Mirabeau Lamar preserve the Texan rumor that Magee was poisoned by his own men, many of whom were among those he had previously mistreated during his former command. Even though very ill, Magee remained in nominal military command. He died while under siege at the Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto de la Bahía in what is now Goliad, Texas, and was succeeded as commander of the expedition by Samuel Kemper, who successfully ended the siege by the Royalists the following month.

Mike + The Mechanics drummer Peter Van Hooke and songwriter and record producer Christopher Neil also appear on the album, serving in the same roles they did for the Mechanics.

The men were from the counties of Alleghany, Rockbridge, Monroe, Greenbrier, and Ohio. It contained only eight companies and became part of the famous Stonewall Brigade. During the war it served under the command of General T.J. Jackson, R.B. Garnett, Charles Sidney Winder, Paxton, J.A. Walker, and W. Terry. The 27th fought at First Manassas, where it earned the nickname “the Bloody 27th” because of its losses, First Kernstown, and in Jackson's Valley Campaign. It then participated in the campaign of the Army of Northern Virginia from the Seven Days' Battles to Cold Harbor, moved with Early to the Shenandoah Valley, and was active around Appomattox. The regiment reported 141 casualties at First Manassas, 57 at First Kernstown, and 4 of the 136 engaged at First Winchester. It lost 3 killed at Cedar Mountain, had 4 killed and 23 wounded at Second Manassas, and sustained 9 killed and 62 wounded at Chancellorsville. Of the 148 in action at Gettysburg about thirty percent were disabled. Only 1 officer and 20 men surrendered. The field officers were Colonels John Echols, James K. Edmondson, William A.

He began competing at a relatively old age, 17, before serving in World War II. During the war, he greatly elevated his game and, in 1946, achieved a world ranking. In 1949, Leach became Great Britain's second World Champion singles player. After winning the title, he achieved widespread fame within the United Kingdom, appearing on television and writing for News of the World. Two years later, Leach added a second singles title. In 1953, he was part of the team that won Great Britain's first, and as of 2014 only, team World Championship. He also won 13 bronze and silver World championship medals between 1947 and 1955. As of 2014, Leach is just one of 11 players from any country to win two singles championships. After Leach retired in 1965, he remained active in the sport. He was England's national coach for eight years and served as president of the English Table Tennis Association for more than 20 years. He continued to write a column for News of the World for twenty years and published several books on table tennis. He also worked as a commentator for the BBC and ITV during table tennis broadcasts. Leach bought a table tennis manufacture and started a talent search agency. In 1966, he was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was inducted into the International Table Tennis Federation Hall of Fame in 1997. Early life John Alfred Leach was born 20 November 1922 in Bow on the east side of London, the son of Jim and Emma Leach. Growing up in Dagenham, Essex, Leach hung out at the British Ropes Works canteen, where his father was the manager. There, he learned to play table tennis. Leach was soon spending every spare moment, up to eight hours a day, practising. On the encouragement of his father, he began to compete in junior- level competitions at the age of 17, considered a late age to get started in competition. As Leach began to get serious about his play, World War II broke out. He enlisted, serving with the Royal Air Force in Northern Ireland as a radioman. He was placed in the same squadron as table tennis player and coach Jack Carrington, who began to instruct him, and international-level player Ron Craydon. Working 24 hours on, 24 hours off shifts, Leach would spend most of his time off practising hitting the ball to different parts of the table. He also met and practised with two international-level players during the war: Victor Barna of Hungary and Richard Bergmann of Austria, both of whom had emigrated to Great Britain. At times, Leach and the others would entertain the troops by competing. Playing career World Championships at Bombay in February, 1952. Considered an all-around player, Leach was tall and skinny. He was equally adept on forehand and backhand. He could play long-range defence, attack from either side of the table, and had an excellent drop shot. Viktor Barna called Leach \\"a great fighter. He never gives up, never loses heart.\\" Bergmann described Leach in 1950: \\"of excellent match temperament and fighting spirit this most outstanding of the English-born players is a good all-rounder who specialises in a cast-iron defence and a fine attack, relying to a certain extent on his long reach.\\" quoted by Barna credited hard work, not natural ability, for Leach's success. Under Carrington's tutelage, Leach quickly elevated his play and became England's top player. By 1946, he achieved a world ranking. In 1947, he reached the semi-finals of the first post-war World Championships by beating Carrington in straight sets in the quarterfinals. He then lost a four-set match to eventual champion Bohumil Váňa of Czechoslovakia. In doubles, Leach and Carrington lost in the finals to Váňa and Adolf Slar. The following year, Leach reached the final sixteen of the World Championships before losing a five-set match to France's Guy Amouretti. Leach faced a tough draw in the 1949 World Championships in Stockholm where he beat Ferenc Sidó, Dick Miles, and Ferenc Soos en route to the final. There he faced two-time singles World Champion Váňa, whom he had never beaten. republished in Leach won the first set 21–19, but dropped the second 11–21. He rallied to win the third set 21–17, but Váňa took the fourth set 21–14. Leach emerged victorious, winning the fifth set 21–16. The win made him just the second British-born player to win a singles World Title. He also made the semi-finals of mixed doubles with Margaret Franks that year, winning a bronze medal. Leach's arrival back in the United Kingdom was filmed by Gaumont British News and shown in cinemas around the country. He became a household name, appearing on TV to promote the sport, writing a weekly column for News of the World, and even appearing in the popular Eagle kid's comic. The \\"Johnny Leach bat\\" became Britain's most popular table tennis equipment. At the 1950 World Championship, Leach lost a hard-fought five-set match to Michel Haguenauer of France in the round of 16. The next year, he regained his singles title by beating Czechoslovakia's Ivan Andreadis in four sets: 16–21, 21–18, 21–18, 21–12. He also made the semi-finals of doubles with Carrington and mixed doubles with Diane Rowe in 1951. The next year, Hiroji Satoh revolutionised the sport with a sponge-covered paddle that allowed him to put drastic spin on the ball. Players with the old style hard wood and rubber paddles such as Leach had little chance. At the 1952 World Championships, Leach was eliminated in the round of 16 in singles by Amouretti. In doubles, he teamed with Bergmann to make the final against Norikazu Fujii and Tadaki Hayashi of Japan. They won the first two sets, but the Japanese team rallied to win the final three sets and the match. In mixed doubles, Leach and Rowe were the runners-up to Hungary's Sidó and Romania's Angelica Rozeanu. Leach tried the new paddles the following year, but found he could not adapt. He was again eliminated in the round of 16 at the 1953 World Championships, this time by Czechoslovakia's Frantisek Tokar. In doubles, Leach and Bergmann again made the final, losing to the Hungarian team of Sidó and József Kóczián in five sets. In the team competition, Leach, Bergman, Adrian Haydon, Brian Kennedy, and Aubrey Simons won the Swaythling Cup, giving Leach a third World Title. The team title was the first in Great Britain's history, and, as of 2014, has not been duplicated. Leach continued to compete at international level, making the World Championships the next four years, but never advancing past the round of 16. He made three more World Championships: 1959 and 1961 in singles and doubles, and 1963 in doubles only. He retired in 1965, after capturing one last national title the year before, in doubles with David Creamer. Leach is one of only eleven players to win at least two individual World Championship titles. He won 16 World Championship medals in total and he reached the world number one ranking during his career. He was inducted into the International Table Tennis Federation Hall of Fame in 1997. Later life Leach remained active in the sport after his playing days. From 1964 until 1972, he served as the English coach, overseeing multiple European Champions. In 1964, he became vice-president of the English Table Tennis Association (ETTA). Simultaneously, he worked at SW Hancock, a table tennis manufacturer he would eventually buy. In 1988, Leach became the president of the ETTA, a post he held until 2011. As president, he helped bring the 1994, 1997, and 1998 World Championship events to England. After his stint as president, Leach was named Honorary Vice- President for life. He continued to write for News of the World for 20 years and was a commentator on ITV and BBC broadcasts. Leach authored a number of books on table tennis, and also served as a coach for actors Gregory Peck and Conrad Yama for an extended table tennis scene in the 1969 film The Chairman.https://tabletennisengland.co.uk/etta_website/magazine- archive/1968-69/tt_issue218.pdf Leach also established a talent-spotting organization operating out of Butlins' children's camps. Throughout the summer, the organization employed many of the game's top players, operating up to nine camps simultaneously across England, Scotland, and Wales. In the morning, the children would receive instruction and in the afternoon they would play each other. The top players at each camp were then invited to a second week of instruction at Bognor Regis. The camps found 50 international players during Leach's life. Leach was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1966. Throughout his retirement, he was one of \\"the sport's most influential ambassadors and promoters\\", according to the ETTA. He played a major role in the work of Swaythling Club International (SCI), which helps former players with medical bills and helps them attend World Championships as spectators. He was SCI President from 1989 to 1991 and from 1993 to 1995; Honorary President in 1995; and Deputy President from 1997 until his death in 2014. Leach remained a fan of table tennis, but said the improved equipment hurt the sport's popularity among spectators due to shorter rallies. In 2006, he was featured in a documentary called Planet Ping Pong. Personal life Leach married his wife Daisy in 1946. The couple had two children: John (d. 2013) and Jeff. Daisy died in 2009. Leach died on 5 June 2014. Upon his death, The Guardian remarked \\"For many years Johnny Leach, who has died aged 91, was synonymous with English table tennis…his impact on the sport was immense.\\" At the time of his death, Leach was the oldest living World Champion. He was survived by his son Jeff and four grandchildren. On and off the court, Leach was known for his humility and gentle nature. Despite being one of the most famous players in the world, he would let others have the spotlight whenever possible. For example, as an official at the Swedish Open in 1988 he was entitled to get his lunch first, but instead went to the back of the line. Another time, he purposely missed the team bus to console a player who lost a World Championship match. Upon his death, Matthew Syed remarked: \\"Leach taught us that courtesy and dignity are perfectly compatible with competitiveness and sparkling success. He was England's greatest player, an example both on and off the table.\\" See also * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists * List of England players at the World Team Table Tennis Championships Publications *Table Tennis for All (Nicholas Kaye, 1951) *Table Tennis My Way (Nicolas Vane, 1955) *Table Tennis Complete (1960) *Table Tennis for the 'Seventies (A.

Álvarez de Toledo was the son of Luis Álvarez de Toledo y Liche, a navy captain of Seville, Spain, and María Dolores Dubois. He was educated at the Escuela Naval de Cádiz and then joined the Spanish Navy in 1806. In 1808 he switched to serving in the British Navy (for a few years). Toledo was elected a representative of Santo Domingo to the Cortes of Cádiz. However he favored independence for Spain's American possessions and was exiled in 1811. He next went to the United States where Secretary of State James Monroe gave him funds to try and form a revolution in Cuba. Toledo then was one of the supporters of José Bernardo Maximiliano Gutierrez de Lara in his efforts for Mexico to secede from Spain. Gutierrez's ancestors were among the first European Spanish settlers and colonizers in Mexico, Texas and surrounding areas. Gutierrez de Lara established himself as the first President of Texas. Toledo sought efforts to become the second President of Texas. Toledo took control of San Antonio on August 1, 1813. He was defeated by the Spanish Army at the Battle of Medina on August 18, 1813. Toledo fled Texas. In 1814 he led an unsuccessful attempt to invade Texas from Louisiana. They made it past the Sabine River but did not make any significant progress. In 1816 Toledo sought to reconcile himself with the Spanish authorities. He opposed the work of Francisco Xavier Mina that year. He then returned to Spain where he was an adviser to King Fernando VII.

Thought to have been built before 1814, it is one of the most important examples of early Neoclassical architecture in the city, and was one of the major houses in the new Federal City when it was built. Its caretaker has been the Smithsonian Institution since 1889, and is the oldest building under the Smithsonian's auspices, but has been left vacant since the 1980s. It was listed in the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1964 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 1973. History Holt House is intimately linked to the early history of both Washington and the nation through its association with such prominent figures as Thomas Johnson (first governor of Maryland), Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Stoddert (first Secretary of the Navy), Benjamin Mackall (Georgetown merchant), John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson. It has been owned by the Smithsonian Institution since 1890, and is the oldest building under its auspices. While Holt House is one of the great country-style estates built during the early years of the new Federal City, it remains a mystery as to who built it and when. The chain of ownership and the backgrounds of the owners of the land on which the house sits suggest it could have been constructed no later than 1814. It seems most likely that the house was built by George Johnson, and if so, his connections to Dr. William Thornton, first Architect of the Capitol, suggest that Thornton may have a hand in the design of Holt House.If the house were built before George Johnson, through Thornton's positions as a City Commissioner, Director of the Bank of Columbia, and as a Quaker, Thornton also had connections with the previous owners of the property before the Johnsons (Benjamin Stoddert, Walter Mackall, and Jonathan Shoemaker), indicating that he was probably familiar with the property even before a house was constructed on it. Benjamin Stoddert The land on which Holt House sits was originally part of a tract of land acquired from the Beall family in 1793 by Benjamin Stoddert (builder of Halcyon House in Georgetown). Stoddert served as a captain in the Revolutionary Army, Secretary of the Board of War (1779–1781), merchant owner in Georgetown, co-founder and President of the Bank of Columbia (1794), and first Secretary of the Navy. It was probably Benjamin Stoddert who built Columbia Mills on the property in the 1790s.From a personal letter by Mrs. Rebecca Stoddert it is known that Stoddert owned a mill in the District of Columbia. Since no other mill property has been traced to the Stodderts in D.C., it is therefore assumed that Stoddert constructed the Columbia Mills and that the \\"buildings, improvements\\" refer to Columbia Mills. District of Columbia Recorder of Deeds, Land Records Liber F6, folio 95-97. Personal letter to Eliza Gantt from Rebecca Stoddert, August 4, 1799. Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, Personal Papers of Rebecca S. Stoddert. Despite his prominent position, Stoddert's land speculation left him land rich and cash poor. Perhaps to help increase his cash flow, he constructed a flour mill on this parcel of land. Walter Mackall In December 1800, Stoddert sold the property, referred to as \\"Pretty Prospect\\" to his friend Walter Mackall. The deed included \\"the buildings, improvements, privileges, advantages and appurtenances.\\"D.C. Recorder of Deeds, Land Records F6, folio 95-97. These \\"buildings\\" may be a reference to only the mill structures, but may also have included some form of a residence for a mill manager. Architectural evidence suggests that the west wing of Holt House may have been built earlier than the rest of the house and may have served as a small residence. If a house the present size of Holt House existed at this time, it would have been significant enough a structure to be mentioned separately in the deed. Walter Mackall came from Calvert County, Maryland, served in the Maryland House of Delegates, and was a wealthy land holder in both Maryland and Washington. His brother, Benjamin Mackall, married Christina Beall, whose father Brooke Beall, was a wealthy shipping merchant in Georgetown, sending great quantities of grain and tobacco to England. When the government moved to Washington in 1800 and when William Thornton was serving as City Commissioner, Benjamin Mackall was one of those in charge of the transfer of the government books from Philadelphia.Sally Somervell Mackall. Early Days Of Washington, 1899 Benjamin may have become involved in the milling part of his father-in-law's business. To his daughter Christina, Beall gave a double square on Georgetown Heights, part of his vast landholdings known as the \\"Rock of Dumbarton,\\" where they built Mackall Square. Walter Mackall owned Pretty Prospect for only four years. He may have originally taken an interest in the mills due to his brother Benjamin's connection to the Beall family business. This was also a period of great land speculation in the new Federal City, and the time when large country-style houses were being constructed in Georgetown and on the outskirts of the City. Mackall may have built the present house or expanded a smaller, pre-existing house on speculation of increased resale value. Jonathan Shoemaker In 1804, Mackall sold the property, which consisted of the existent \\"mills, mill seats, way waters, buildings, and improvements\\"Land Transfer Deed from Walter Mackall to Jonathan Shoemaker. D.C. Recorder of Deeds, Land Records K10, folio 117-118) also DC Recorder of Deeds, Land Records W22, folio 112. to Pennsylvania Quaker and miller Jonathan Shoemaker for $3,800 with an additional mortgage for a total cost $9,600. He arrived with his family of five sons and one daughter to operate the mills. While the deed acquired by Shoemaker now mentions the mills, it still does not refer to a house on the property. Problems at Columbia Mills and a dispute with Thomas Jefferson forced the Shoemakers to sell the property and relocate to Shadwell, Virginia to help operate Jefferson's mills there. The Shoemakers were among the earliest Quaker settlers in the area and traveled far to attend meetings. As a former Quaker, Mrs. Roger Johnson may have known Jonathan and Elizabeth Shoemaker as they may have attended the same Quaker meetings in Indian Springs, Maryland. When the first Quaker Meeting was held in Georgetown in 1806, the Shoemakers may have made the acquaintance of architect William Thornton then, but sold the property only three years later.\\"Records Relating to Pre-National Zoological Park Purchases.\\" Smithsonian Institution Archival and Historic Preservation Division. Available at: http://www.si.edu/oahp/holthous/pz1834on.htm. The fact that Shoemaker took a mortgage to acquire the property and sold it for less than his original purchase price suggests that he was not in a financial position at this time to construct a larger manor house the size of Holt House, had it not already existed when he bought the property. Additionally, his Quaker beliefs would suggest a more modest lifestyle, as he relied on his family and not employees or slaves to run the mills, and would not have allowed for managing a house of this size as well. Ultimately, the Shoemaker family was prosperous, and Pierce Shoemaker returned to Washington and purchased what is known today as Peirce Mill on Rock Creek Park. Roger Johnson In 1809, Jonathan Shoemaker sold the property for $7,500 to Roger Johnson, of Frederick County, Maryland,Land Transfer Deed from Jonathan Shoemaker to Roger Johnson. D.C. Recorder of Deeds, Land Records W22, folio 109-111.7. James Dunlop Papers. Record Book 1809–1919. Maryland Historic Society. MS 316. the younger brother of Maryland's first governor, Thomas Johnson. This was an investment on Roger's part, as he already owned two foundries, a glass works, and a plantation in Frederick County and remained at his home \\"Bloomsbury\\" in Frederick County, while sending his son George to manage Columbia Mills. Around 1809 or 1810, George Johnson is wed to Elizabeth Dunlop, daughter of wealthy Georgetown merchant James Dunlop, and the niece of Thomas Peter (the builder of Tudor Place and designed by Dr. William Thornton). There is evidence that George was married by 1810 and may have been living at the mill property by then, as Mrs. Dunlop (George's mother-in-law) sent three house slaves to her daughter in that year,James Dunlop Papers. Record Book 1809–1919. Maryland Historical Society. MS 316 which would probably not have occurred were they living with the Dunlops. Beginning in 1812, George Johnson began borrowing large sums of money in order to rebuild the mills after they burned, employing a millwright to build \\"the best mill possible,\\"Roberta Johns Peter. \\"The Johnson Family.\\" Maryland Historical Society, n.d. and possibly may have used some of this money to construct a new house, or enlarge an existing house on the property as well. Perhaps the first reference to a \\"house\\" on the property appears in an 1818 letter from George Johnson to his father-in-law, James Dunlop.Letter from George Johnson to James Dunlop, 21 Dec 1818. Dunlop Papers 1788–1908. Maryland Historical Society. He was concerned that the house (which he refers to in the letter as \\"my house,\\" \\"in town\\") would be attached with a lien due to his large debts, and was in hopes of renting it out. Possibly, George owned another house in Georgetown at that time as well. While \\"in town\\" in present- day terms generally refers to an urban center, because George Johnson is writing from Frederick, he may be referring to Washington in general. There have been no records discovered to-date that show any evidence of another residence for George Johnson other than Pretty Prospect. George's financial problems, beginning as early as 1814, suggest that he was not in a position to construct a large house after about 1812, due possibly in part to the financial impact of the British blockade of the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac at that time. In 1818, due to the extent of George's debts, Roger Johnson attempted to intervene on behalf of his son. Only two days after George's letter from Frederick, Roger also writes to James Dunlop. In his letter to Dunlop, he says that he hopes to sell his lot near the mill in the spring, then later to \\"sell the half of his Mil\\" (which he never did). Roger also asks James Dunlop to assume payment on half of George's debts, as he considered him partially responsible as the under signer of the loans.Letter from Roger Johnson to James Dunlop, 23 Dec 1818. Dunlop Papers 1788–1908. Maryland Historical Society. In his letter to Dunlop, Roger makes no separate reference to a house, only to the lot near the mill. But, according to Smithsonian records, a month before this letter was sent, Roger had already transferred the deed for the mill to the Bank of Columbia, with George's father-in-law, James Dunlop serving as trustee \\"to set up and sell at public sale for cash or upon credit\\" against George's debts, which totaled $28,161.55 with interest. The deed transfer encompassed \\"the Mill houses, dwelling houses, buildings, improvements.\\"Roger Johnson deed transfer to transfer to James Dunlop of the Bank of Columbia. 1818. D.C. Recorder of Deeds, Land Records AT44, folio 39-42. Roger maintained possession of 13 acres of Pretty Prospect, which later become the Holt House property. It is uncertain who was paying on the mortgage between 1818 and 1823, but in fear of losing his home, in 1823 George approached his cousin Louisa Johnson Adams (wife of John Quincy Adams) in hopes that John Quincy would acquire the mortgage from the bank. Adams mortgaged his house in order to purchase the mill in 1823 for $20,000, and placed George on salary to continue to manage the mill, with the understanding that George would later buy back half the mills from Adams.Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, Adams Papers, John Quincy Adams Diary. Within months of purchasing the property, Adams became president. Adams had hoped that the mills would be able to provide him some income and security in his retirement years. However, in 1823 his father (John Adams) wagered that demand would soar, and increased production. John Quincy watched as prices fell, costing him $15,000.Joseph Wheelan. Mr. Adams: Last Crusade. New York: Public Affairs, 2008. p. 65. Although never a successful business, the mill remained in the possession of the Adams' family until about 1872. In 1824, George's arrangement with Adams to manage the mills was terminated by Adams due to George's inability to run them efficiently. In that same year, George once again approached Adams for assistance, soliciting a place as a Clerk in one of the Departments, to which John Quincy assured him he would \\"in no case recommend him.\\" George may have continued to reside in the house until his brother finally sold the estate in 1835. Records show that by 1827, George was working as a clerk at 1st Comptroller's Office in Georgetown.Washington/ Georgetown City Directory, 1827. Smithsonian Institution, American History Library. Microfiche file for Washington City Directories. p.44, no. 1519. There are no records to date to indicate another resident at Holt House between George's tenure there and the time it was sold in 1835. Ashton Alexander In 1831, Roger Johnson died, leaving the disposal of the 13 acres of Pretty Prospect to his sons, Joseph A. and Charles Johnson, requesting that \\"the house\\" and lot of land adjoining the Columbia Mills be sold to cover outstanding debts. It was not until 1835 that they sold the property to Dr. Ashton Alexander, a prominent physician from Baltimore, for whose family Alexandria, Virginia is named. Dr. Alexander never resided in Washington himself, and in 1838, rented the house to Amos Kendall, postmaster general of the United States, a close confidant of Andrew Jackson, and one of the founders of the modern Democratic Party. Kendall dubbed the house \\"Jackson Hill\\" in admiration of his friend, probably much to the chagrin of Jackson's political rival and adjacent property owner, John Quincy Adams. Amos Kendall must not have been the best of tenants, as in 1841, Dr. Alexander placed an advertisement in the newspaper the National Intelligencer offering the property for lease or sale, declaring that “it has undergone three years of deterioration by the worst treatment by those who unfortunately tenanted. The proofs of which are grievously visible at a glance. And for the whole three years not a dollar, so far, has been received for damages or rent.” Dr. Henry Holt Dr. Henry Holt, a former U.S. Army assistant surgeon from Oswego County, New York, purchased the property in December 1844. Dr. Holt and his family finally sold the property to the commissioners for the National Zoological Park in 1889 for $40,000. By the time the Zoo purchased the property in 1889, Holt House was very dilapidated and badly in need of extensive repair. In helping plan the new zoological park, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. advised the park's planners to look to the graceful architecture of Holt House as a source of inspiration. National Zoo To meet the Zoo's needs for an administrative building and to stabilize the structure, there were so many changes made to the structure between 1890 and 1903, that much of the interior, historic fabric was lost. Despite its structural problems, however, the building has retained its distinctive character of a nineteenth- century country villa, which appeals to visitors. Zoo personnel occupied the building until 1988 after which it was boarded up, pending a future use. While the building is once again neglected, its purchase by the Zoo in 1889 probably helped ensure its survival over nearly 200 years. Congress has limited spending on the house: Architecture of Holt House Holt House is one of the few remaining \\"suburban villas\\" in Washington, D.C, a design concept by the 16th-century Italian architect, Andrea Palladio. As with Holt House, many designs modeled after Palladio's consist of five parts: a central or main block, flanked by a pair of symmetrical wings, connected to the main block by narrower hyphens and end pavilions or wings. Holt House is in the \\"piano nobile\\" design style, with the upper or main floor of the house containing the formal rooms and family living quarters and the lower level or ground level usually functioning as a service area and cellar. The ground level of Holt House is thought originally to have had at least five rooms, less finely finished than the main floor and not a full story in height. The west wing had an interior stair that connected the lower floor with the upper floor, possibly connecting a ground level kitchen with an upper level dining area. Due to the different methods of construction of the two wings, including an oversized external chimney and bricked-up door and window openings, the west wing may predate the rest of the house. It may have been used as a residence for earlier owners of the mill, or used as the main family dwelling as the other parts of the house were completed, as was the custom in the 18th century. This was the sequence of construction at Tudor Place (designed by Dr. William Thornton, first Architect of the Capitol), the Custis-Lee Mansion (Arlington House), and Kalorama (designed by Benjamin Latrobe). Holt House was built of load bearing masonry walls, primarily of brick but intermingled with local stones and rocks. The exterior of the masonry was covered with a white limed based stucco, with a smooth finish and possibly scored to resemble ashlar; similar to the exterior finish of Tudor Place. The central block and matching wings on Holt House have gabled roofs with pedimented façades that are articulated with equally spaced modillions. The modillions are rectangular blocks or brackets used horizontally in a way that appears to support the roof above. The pediment of the central block, on the north and south elevations, was accentuated with a semi-circular window. Originally the north entrance served as the main entrance to the house and the entrance hall, accessed by a stairway from the ground level to the main level's open porch. Beneath the porch was an enclosed space accessed on both the east and west elevations through arched openings. Both arches remain today. The south side of the house was accessible via a door on the ground level, and on the main level by a pair of matching spiral staircases. The paired spiral stairs were unique to this area but not extraordinary in Palladio's designs. The grand room on the main level opened to a porch with flat, parapeted flat roof. The main level entrances on both the north and south sides of the central block were three panel double-doors with glazed sidelight sashes. A significant architectural feature of Holt House's design was the use of Wyatt windows in the south elevation. These tripartite sash windows, with a center sash of six over nine, were a design popularized by the English architect, James Wyatt in the 18th century. The Wyatt window is similar to a Serliana or Palladian window, but without a center-arched glazed section. Wyatt windows are found in many houses in the Washington vicinity at the turn of the 19th century.

","title":"Holt House (Washington, D.C.)"},{"id":"24914794","text":"Curb Your Enthusiasm is an American comedy series starring Seinfeld writer, co-creator, and executive producer Larry David as himself. It is produced and broadcast by HBO. The show features a large cast of recurring characters. Frequently recurring characters Richard Lewis Richard Lewis (as a fictionalized version of himself, Season 1–) is a neurotic stand-up comedian who has recently recovered from alcohol and drug problems. Richard is one of Larry's oldest and closest friends, both having moved from New York City to Los Angeles to pursue careers in comedy. Despite this, his relationship with Larry is often volatile and complicated. Often, Richard becomes the victim of Larry's follies, causing Richard to blame Larry for almost everything wrong in his life. He is usually more sensible and moral than Larry. He has also had numerous very attractive girlfriends over the course of the show, which Larry often tends to offend or clash with in some way. Richard Lewis first appeared in the show's first episode (after the pilot), \\"The Pants Tent.\\" Ted Danson Ted Danson (as a fictionalized version of himself, Seasons 1, 3–7, 9–10) is an old friend of Larry's despite the fact that Larry often insults him behind his back. When Cheryl and Larry separate, Ted chooses to side with Cheryl as the two often do charitable work with the NRDC. Danson often appears with his real life wife, Mary Steenburgen, who also plays a fictionalized version of herself. A sub-plot in season 9 involves Ted's separation from Mary, and his dating Cheryl, much to Larry's dismay. Ted invests in a restaurant with Larry and Jeff in season three, but he ends up leaving the project because he is upset with Larry. Larry and Ted constantly have problems exchanging gifts such as when Larry gives Ted a shirt with a hole in it, something Ted calls \\"a problem\\" rather than a gift. In the episode \\"The Freak Book,\\" Larry gives Ted a book titled Mondo Freaks, which offends Ted and Mary, then crashes Ted's birthday party by bringing his driver in, who gets drunk and harasses Mary. In \\"The Hot Towel,\\" Larry gives Ted and Mary a $300 gift certificate to a restaurant, but gets offended when he sees them using the gift certificate with Jeff and Susie instead of with him. Danson first appeared in the show's second episode, \\"Ted and Mary.\\" Sammi Greene Sammi Greene (Ashly Holloway, Season 2–9) is Jeff and Susie's daughter, who is now an adult. Sammi has developed an interest in singing publicly, even though she does not possess much talent. When Sammi sang at a party hosted by Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, Larry David interrupted her song to save the crowd from having to listen to it, but he ended up upsetting the partygoers. Sammi, as a child, once said she would choose her dog, Oscar, over her father, if the two could not live together. Sammi was originally a boy, being only spoken of in the first episode of the series \\"The Pants Tent.\\" She first appeared in the Season 2 episode, \\"The Doll.\\" In the closing credits, her name is sometimes spelled \\"Sammy\\" or \\"Sammie\\". As of season 9, she is engaged to be married to an Afghanistan War vet, whom Larry upsets by refusing to thank him for his service. Nat David Nat David (Shelley Berman, Season 3–7) is Larry's Jewish widowed father. He usually tends to make mistakes that Larry calls him out on. His physical resources are diminishing because of his age, leading him to glaucoma and occasional hearing loss. He is not very confrontational, but he does have a high sensitivity for their Jewish culture. Nat calls bad drivers \\"Schmohawks\\". Nat first appeared in the Season 3 episode, \\"The Special Section.\\" Marty Funkhouser Martin Norton Funkhouser (Bob Einstein, Season 4–9) is one of Larry's oldest friends. Despite this, he and Larry tend to disagree on many topics such as whether he is too old to be called an orphan, and he also argues that he is Larry's best friend, which Larry constantly tries to refute. He has a wife, Nan, and one son, Joey, who is transgender and bisexual, as well as a sister with mental health issues named Bam Bam (Catherine O'Hara). He is often very methodical and by-the-book about most of his actions and puts much emphasis on family first, making sure the entire family takes one opinion on a certain matter. Despite that, he has been known to take credit for things which may or may not necessarily apply to him. Funkhouser is an avid golfer, golfing at the same country club as Larry and Jeff. Funkhouser first appeared in the fourth-season episode \\"The Weatherman.\\" Uninvited, he turns up to Seinfeld reunion rehearsals, much to Larry's disdain, and befriends Jerry Seinfeld. Funkhouser divorces his wife in the episode \\"The Divorce\\".

Larry blames Norm when he receives a reprimanded by the club for having a messy locker. Norm was the slowest golfer on the course, so others dreaded golfing behind him, until Larry, not knowing Norm had high blood pressure, yells at him and tells him off for his slow golfing.

Jason constantly refers to George Costanza as a \\"schmuck,\\" a \\"yutz,\\" and an \\"idiot,\\" which irritates Larry because the character was based on him. Jason returns in season seven to star in a Seinfeld reunion episode. During the filming of the reunion, Jason begins to get too close to Cheryl David, who has the role of George's ex-wife. Larry gets upset and makes changes to the script to keep Jason and Cheryl apart, but this causes Jason to leave the show.

Also, Leon Black, played by JB Smoove was also a part of the family during these seasons. Cha Cha Cha Cha (Tia Carrere, Season 6) is Richard Lewis' girlfriend. She is often quite friendly to Larry, despite some of his faux pas, including one where he inadvertently admitted he found her sexually attractive. Larry had gotten her a job when his friend needed a receptionist. But he found that her friendliness was sometimes too overbearing, since whenever he passed her desk to use the restroom she would talk to him constantly, and expressed too much concern for his bathroom habits. She first appears in the episode \\"Meet the Blacks.\\" =Season 7= Michael Richards Michael Richards (as a fictionalized version of himself, Season 7) is an actor Larry worked with on Seinfeld and Fridays. He appears in season seven to play Cosmo Kramer in the Seinfeld reunion. He was once diagnosed with Groat's Disease and came to Larry for help to cope with it mentally.

He first appeared in the episode \\"The Reunion.\\" Mocha Joe Mocha Joe (Saverio Guerra, Season 7, 10) runs a coffee stand on the NBC lot as well as delivering coffee to certain offices at the studio. He develops a grudge against Larry when he refuses to tip him for a small favor. He first appears in the episode \\"Seinfeld\\".

During that period the plant produced the T-34 tank. Tractor production began in 1993. In the post-Soviet Union period the state's decision to fund tank production at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil (manufacturer of the T-90 tank) at the expense of the Omsk factory caused financial ruin for the company. The organisation had designed a new prototype tank, named Black Eagle but it did not enter production.

It is loosely based on the famous partnership between the Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan, and his British mentor, the mathematician, G.H. Hardy. The novel was shortlisted for the 2009 International Dublin Literary Award. Summary The novel is inspired by the career of the self- taught mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, as seen mainly through the eyes of his mentor and collaborator G.H. Hardy, a British mathematics professor at Cambridge University. The novel is framed through a series of lectures that Hardy gave on the subject of Ramanujan's life and mathematics at New Lecture School at Harvard in the summer of 1936 and the narrative switches between Hardy's recollections and the events of the 1910s when Ramanujan was in England. The framed narrative begins in January 1913, in Cambridge, England, where Hardy receives a letter filled with unorthodox but imaginative mathematics and asking for support and guidance. Setting The novel is set against the backdrop of the First World War and colonial India. It features such prominent writers and public figures as D. H.

It was run by the Sisters of Mercy.St Vincent’s Industrial School, Goldenbridge (‘Goldenbridge’), 1880–1983, Chapter 7, section 7-09, Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse History The Sisters of Mercy order was founded by Catherine McAuley in Dublin in 1831. In 1855, Cardinal Paul Cullen invited the Sisters of Mercy to provide a rehabilitation service to women who had been incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison, by educating them and preparing them for final release. The convict refuge was opened in 1856. The Sisters continued with this work until 1883. In 1880 a building within Goldenbridge convent was certified as an industrial school and named St Vincent’s Industrial School. It opened with an initial intake of 30 girls. In 1883 the convict refuge was converted into an industrial school. About thirty sisters were housed in the convent at Goldenbridge, which housed a large national school and a laundry which closed in the 1950s. Few of the sisters worked in the industrial school. The industrial school closed in 1983. Throughout the early 20th century, the Industrial School would receive children from the Dublin Police Court system, who had been convicted of crimes under the Industrial Schools Act 1868 and the Children Act 1908. These crimes fell into the categories of homelessness, wandering, destitution, begging, lack of proper guardianship, and non- attendance at school. Children as young as three years old would be sentenced to incarceration in an institution until their 16th birthday.Personal correspondence with Mercy Congregational Archives, 2015 Inspections In March 1941, Dr. McCabe carried out a general inspection and found that the School was ‘well kept’ and satisfactory in all areas. There is no General Inspection Report for 1942. The next inspection took place on 27 January 1944 and she commented that the premises were ‘very well kept, clean and tidy’ and most areas were found to be ‘satisfactory’, but she found that the ‘children looked far from being neat and tidy’. She said that their clothes were ‘tattered and untidy’ and their blankets were ‘thin and worn’. The General Inspection Reports of the 1940s criticised the food and diet of the children; in particular, insufficient quantities of milk and butter were given during the war years. The Department of Education had allotted certain rations of milk and butter for children in industrial schools, and these quantities were not adhered to in Goldenbridge. Dr McCabe's General Inspection Reports from 1948 until her retirement in 1963 were, without exception, very positive. The General Inspection Reports after Dr McCabe's retirement continued to be very favourable about the living conditions in the School. Dr Charles Lysaght, who carried out a General Inspection of the School on 21 March 1966, commented that it was ‘well run’: the premises were clean and in ‘good repair’ and the accommodation consisted mostly of modern buildings with ‘excellent dormitory accommodation’. In the 1970s, Graham Granville took over as the Department's General Inspector. His reports were also very favourable of the living conditions and the premises and accommodation. However, Mr Granville was concerned about the lack of qualifications of the staff and the change in the type of child that was being admitted. A lot of the children were categorised as \\"disturbed\\". Proposals for the group home system were advocated, and sanction was given, but these plans were not carried through until the 1980s. Media coverage Christine Buckley was interviewed on The Gay Byrne Show on 8 November 1992 as she was looking for her parents. Media interest in Goldenbridge and other institutional abuse were sporadic until the broadcast in 1996 of the documentary Dear Daughter which made very serious allegations about physical and emotional abuse. Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse The Commission reviewed conditions at the facility during the period 1936 to 1983. St. Vincent's was under the management of the Sisters of Mercy Convent in Carysfort, the mother house of all the Dublin Mercy Communities. The Superior of the Goldenbridge convent had very little involvement with the day- to-day running of the School. Her role consisted of interacting with the Department of Education. The actual management of the Industrial School was left to two nuns – the Sister-in-Charge and, from 1942 onwards, her assistant. The day-to-day operation of the School and the care of the children were left to two un-trained lay teachers. After classes, these women supervised the children and put them to bed. They were assisted by four care workers, one in the kitchen, one in the laundry and two generally in the house. In the evening, the sister returned to the convent, and the two lay teachers looked after the children until the next day. > The children cared for in Goldenbridge had, prior to their reception into > care, experienced gross neglect, deprivation and multiple trauma. They were > often rejected by their immediate and extended family and by the broader > society. They were admitted in large numbers to a service which could not > even begin to provide an appropriate level of care. ...No professional > training was available to provide understanding or direction to service > organisation or therapeutic interventions.\\"The Crowley Report\\", quoted by > Ryan Commission at 7.224 The physical environment was totally unstable and did not facilitate either supervision or privacy. The financial resources were grossly inadequate and determined the availability of personnel and material necessities. Some of the care practices may be understood by reference to the harsh historical context. Some actions experienced as abusive may not have had such intent, but were experienced as such due to insensitivity and ignorance. The regime became kinder and more child-centred in the late 1960s and the number of complainants was small, which suggests that even though Goldenbridge was still a large, crowded institution, better management could have an important bearing on the quality of life of the children. Staffing Among the Commissions findings was that during the 1940s Goldenbridge was both over-crowded and understaffed, however defects in the management of the School were not observed by official inspectors. Physical abuse Abuse by the largely unsupervised lay staff became a major feature of life in Goldenbridge in the 1950s and 1960s. The use of former residents as staff was influenced by limited finance and tended to be limited to those who could not survive in aftercare. These were probably the most unsuitable people to care for vulnerable children. Allegations of corporal punishment made against both Sisters and lay teachers appear to be correct in many instances. Corporal punishment was pervasive, unpredictable, arbitrary and was used for small infringements, although after the 1960s it decreased significantly. It was used as a punishment for bedwetting as late as the 1970s. Beatings on the landing were particularly cruel. Children were protected if they had family members who visited them or if staff liked them. No punishment book seems to have been kept, contrary to regulations and this was not noted by the Departmental Inspector. Sexual abuse The commission concluded that in general there was not an issue with sexual abuse, though one incident in 1962 was dealt with promptly. However, the management did not consider the possibility of abuse when sending children to foster families. Emotional abuse Goldenbridge could have had a regime that was kinder and made children feel safe and secure. Low self-esteem was still a problem for those in Goldenbridge who testified to the Commission. Children were regularly humiliated and belittled by the nuns and carers who were supposed to look after them. Those with family who were in regular contact were shown favouritism. Girls who left Goldenbridge had a poor preparation for the outside world. Neglect Children suffered from severe neglect, though very hard work by two nuns produced improvements. Departmental inspections were weak as they did not record the neglect. From 1952 onwards, Dr McCabe reported that the clothes were ‘very good’. In her General Inspection Report of May 1955, she stated, \\"children very well groomed\\". Education The Department of Education school inspection report for March 1935 had noted a very satisfactory educational standard in Goldenbridge, with each school subject rated either ‘very good’ or ‘good on the whole’. Within seven years, standards in the school had plummeted. In 1942, there were only two untrained lay teachers responsible for educating 150 children of different ages and abilities. These two teachers were ill-equipped to deal with this workload. From the late 1950s, children who showed academic ability were given the opportunity of pursuing post primary education because of a scholarship fund set up by the Archbishop of Dublin. In the 1960s, and a number of children were sent out to do secretarial courses towards the end of their time there. The internal primary school for the industrial school had a lower standard of education than that for the external school. Given their disadvantaged backgrounds, many of the children were in need of what would now be termed remedial education. No support or encouragement was given to children with serious educational problems such as little or no education. Children were taken out of school for domestic duties, with some being taken out more than others. In addition to the normal national school curriculum, children aged 13 and over participated in a domestic economy training module overseen by the Department of Education. Many children were only trained for domestic service. Aftercare did not feature prominently in the testimony of witnesses before the Committee. The Sisters appeared to be able to find positions for most of the girls when they left at 16 years of age. Chores Older girls education suffered as they were taken out of class to look after younger girls. Chores became abusive because they were too taxing and carried out under threat of punishment. Older girls had no recreational or personal time because of chores and bead-making. Rosary Bead making At some time in the early 1950s or the late 1940s, Sr Alida was approached by a businessman who suggested that the Institution could become involved in making rosary beads. Thus, the bead- making industry in Goldenbridge was introduced into the daily routine of the pupils, and continued until the mid-1960s. Children in Goldenbridge produced rosary beads from the 1940s to the 1960s. They had a quota of sixty decades a day on weekdays and ninety on Saturdays. The commission remarked that the conditions children worked under caused stress and anxiety and would not have been tolerated in factories. The commission also noted that the bead-making deprived children of recreation that was essential for social, emotional and psychological growth. Food Throughout the 1950s, the food and diet of the children was described as ‘very good’ by Dr McCabe. She spoke favourably of the food and diet when she inspected the School on two occasions in 1955. In particular, she stated that the meals ‘were attractive, well cooked and attractively served’. Dr Lysaght inspected Goldenbridge on behalf of the Department in March 1966. He wrote a detailed report in which he noted that the children looked well nourished and healthy. He inspected the main meal of the day, which consisted of soup, milk, mincemeat, vegetables, custard and tinned pears, and he found that the amounts served were ample and well cooked. Food was of poor quality and there was little of it. Occasional attempts to remedy this did little to help. Scraps of food were thrown from a container and children scrambled for them.

They are the remnant of 15 built along that street as affordable housing when the Upper East Side was just beginning to be developed. They are distinctive for the round-arched windows and door openings on their north (front) facades, an unusual trim for houses otherwise firmly in the Italianate architectural style common for urban buildings of that era. They are the second oldest group of buildings on the Upper East Side after the East 78th Street Houses a block to the east, but unlike that row they retain more of their original appearance. In 1978 they were designated New York City landmarks,, New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; May 9, 1978; retrieved November 1, 2009. and in 1983 they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Buildings The row is on the south side of East 78th, between Second and Third avenues. The block is residential, with many similar, taller rowhouses on both sides of the tree-lined street. The neighborhood is just outside the Upper East Side Historic District, close to the southern edge of Yorkville. Each house is three stories high and two bays, only 13 feet 4 inches (4.06 m) wide on a raised basement. All are trimmed with carved stone elliptical arched surrounds. The entryways and the adjacent first-story windows have an additional keystone molding. The upper windows also have corbeled sills. The flat rooflines have projecting cornices with vertical brackets. Stoops with iron railings lead to the sidewalk from the entryways, all located on the east bay of the front facades. There are a few deviations from these standards. The house at 214 has had shutters added, and it and 216 have had some of their original ironwork replaced. At 218, the original brownstone stoop has been replaced with a modern concrete one. History The construction of the Third Avenue Railway in 1852 allowed residents of what was then the village of Yorkville to commute to jobs in what is today Midtown and Lower Manhattan. The present area of East 78th Street was still an undeveloped section of Yorkville nine years later, in 1861, when Howard Martin bought 200 feet (60 m) of frontage along the block to build speculative housing. In accordance with a New York Supreme Court decision a year earlier, Martin paid $128 ($ in contemporary dollars) to the city for the opening of 78th Street. He had subdivided it into 15 lots, numbered 206–234 East 78th, and had begun building when he sold the properties to William Brower in 1862. Brower retained the builders, Warren and Ransom Beman and John Buckley, a likely reason for the uniformity of the resulting buildings. Construction was delayed somewhat by the difficulty of getting materials during the Civil War, but Brower had sold all the houses by the time construction was finished in 1865. Since then, number 206 on the west end of the row and 220–234 on the east have been demolished to build the neighboring, taller apartment buildings. Other than the alterations noted above, they are as they were when originally built. All five have remained private residences. In 2010 a real estate listing for 208 East 78th gave its rent as $15,775 a month.

Born in Bannay in the Cher department, in 1906 he moved with his family to Chelles in the Seine-et-Marne department. He became a carpenter and joined the Young Socialists in 1918. After the Tours Congress of 1920, Fouchard left the Socialists and joined the French Communist Party. He first stood in the 1929 municipal elections in Chelles unsuccessfully for the Communists, but in 1935 was elected mayor of Chelles on a joint Socialist-Communist ticket. In 1936 he was elected to the French Chamber of Deputies to represent the Meaux district. In September 1939, following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Fouchard left the Communists. The French Communist Party was banned following this but Fouchard, who had distanced himself from the Party, was not investigated. He asked to be allowed to rejoin the French Army and became one of the leading members in the new Union populaire française. Following France's defeat in the battle of France and the armistice with Nazi Germany, Fouchard was one of the 80 members of parliament who voted against granting extraordinary powers to Marshal Philippe Petain on 10 July 1940. Fouchard was removed from his post as mayor of Chelles in 1941. He moved to the Lot department in Vichy France where he became involved with the French Resistance in the left-wing, Communist- dominated FTP (Francs-Tireurs et Partisans). Fouchard was arrested by the Vichy government in August 1942 and spent the remainder of the occupation imprisoned, first at Cahors and then at Saint-Sulpice-la-Pointe. Freed at the liberation of France in 1944, Fouchard served in the reconstituted French National Assembly but did not seek election in 1945. He returned to local government politics in 1953, elected on a non-Communist left-wing ticket, but retired for a second and final time from politics in 1959. He died at Montfermeil near Paris aged 94. A memorial to Fouchard exists in the public park in Chelles named after him.

Dimitar Ganchev was born in 1875 in the town of Ruse, Northern Bulgaria. After he graduated from the high-school in Ruse, he studied natural sciences at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. In 1897 he became a member of the so-called Geneva group – an anarchistic revolutionary circle led by Mihail Gerdzhikov and Petar Mandzhukov. With the assistance of his close friend Gotse Delchev, in 1901 Dimitar Ganchev was successfully hired as a teacher at the Bulgarian Pedagogical School in Skopie. In this city, he became a member of the IMARO and in 1902 he was chosen a member of the Skopie district revolutionary committee.

Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales. As it is a saprobic fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead coniferous trees. P. flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in boreal and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified. Taxonomy This species was first recognised in 1783 by the German, August Batsch, as Agaricus flammans, and later sanctioned by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum. The specific epithet flammans is a Latin adjective meaning flaming. In 1871, with the recognition of Pholiota as an independent genus with type species Pholiota squarrosa, another German, Paul Kummer renamed the fungus Pholiota flammans. Lucien Quélet, a French mycologist, proposed another synonym, Dryophila flammans in 1886. American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill called the species Hypodendrum flammans in his 1912 study of Pacific Coast mushrooms, although he did not explain his rationale for transferring the species to Hypodendrum. In the organization of Rolf Singer, the species is placed in subgenus Pholiota, section Adiposae, stirps Subflammans—a grouping of closely related species that also includes P. subflammans and P. digilioi. The species in stirps Subflammans are characterised by having conspicuous erect tufts or scales on the cap surface that are easily sloughed off by rain and age in lieu of the gelatinous nature of the underlying cap cuticle. It is commonly known as the yellow Pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap. Description Pholiota flammans often has a striking appearance. The cap is initially round, then convex and finally flattening with age. Its surface is bright yellow to orange, and covered with triangular scales (squamules) arranged in concentric rings.Below the level of the ring, the stem is covered in concentrically arranged squamules. The cap surface is dry, matt and felt-like, and in wet conditions may lose scales. The cap margin remain curved slightly inwards. The yellow gills are crowded together, attached to the stem, and have a notch where the gill attaches to the stem. A bright yellow partial veil extending from the cap edge to the edge is present in immature species. As the cap expands and flattens with age, the partial veil tears, leaving a faint ring around the stem. The cylindrical straight or curved stem is itself covered in yellow squamules below the ring. The base of the stem, typically more orange in color than the upper portion, is firmly attached to the dead wood from which the fungus arises. The section of stem above the ring bears little or no protuberances. The flesh is firm, full, yellow and does not change color when bruised or injured. The dimensions of the fruit body are as follows: cap diameter up to , stem up to tall and between cm thick. As the fruit body matures, the gills darken to cinnamon brown following spore release. The spore mass is colored brown to rust.  Microscopic features  Under a light microscope, the spores are seen to be smooth, elliptical to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3 µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5 µm. The gill cystidia are seen to stain blue when cotton blue dye and lactate are applied. The cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100 µm thick layer of gelatinous hyphae that are about 2–4 µm thick. The gelatinous hyphae are only present on the cap surface, not the surface of the stem; these local differences in cell structure explain the ease with which the scales are sloughed off the cap, but not the stems of the fruit bodies. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail. Edibility Pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no distinctive smell and taste mild to slightly bitter. Some authors regard the mushroom as inedible, while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility. Similar species P. squarrosa is a lookalike species Other members of the genus Pholiota may be mistaken for Pholiota flammans, especially Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts at the base of deciduous as well as coniferous trees. P. squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P. flammans. P. adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P. flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap. The North American species once described by Alexander H. Smith, P. kauffmaniana, is closely related to P. flammans, but differs in having a more distinctly viscid cap. Smith was later to revise his opinion on the existence of P. kauffmaniana as a unique species—he believed that environmental variations in humidity were the cause of differences in the cap cuticle gelatinization observed in Pholiotas collected from different North American locales. P. kauffmaniana is now considered synonymous with P. flammans. Habitat and distribution Being saprobic, P. flammans is found exclusively on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees, with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn. It is a fungus with a wide geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.

The GD-01 was designed and built by a collaboration of DAMS and Reynard engineers from 1994 to 1995, and was intended to establish the team--which had achieved considerable success in lower categories--in Formula One (F1), the premier Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-sanctioned level of racing. However, due to insufficient financial backing, the team never entered the championship, despite completing construction of the chassis and conducting limited testing. Concept DAMS was founded by Jean-Paul Driot and F1 driver René Arnoux in 1988, and was based in Le Mans. The team quickly became a competitive force in International Formula 3000, the level of motorsport immediately below F1, winning the 1990, 1993 and 1994 drivers' championships with Érik Comas, Olivier Panis and Jean- Christophe Boullion respectively. Driot aimed to take the next step in the team's progression by moving up to F1, thus emulating the examples of the Jordan, Pacific and Forti teams, all successful Formula 3000 teams which graduated to F1 in the first half of the 1990s., p. 8 In order to design and build a competitive F1 car, DAMS established a partnership with British constructor Reynard, an experienced constructor of racing cars for junior formulae and the American racing scene. The company had also provided data which assisted with the construction of the Benetton B192 and Ligier JS37 F1 cars, and had also built its own chassis, which ultimately became the Pacific PR01 after Reynard's plan to operate its own team fell through. DAMS set up an office near Reynard's headquarters, and assigned former Ligier designer Claude Galopin and Reynard employee Rob Arnott to lead the chassis design team. Construction Construction of the GD-01 began in 1994, but progress was slow due to limited financial backing. Sponsorship proved hard to find due to the presence of two existing French teams in the sport--Ligier and Larrousse-- and the Le Mans region's focus on its 24-hour race. In addition, changes to the sport's technical regulations--as a result of the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix--further hindered progress. By the beginning of the 1995 season, nevertheless, the GD-01 was nearly complete., p. 9 This led Gérard Larrousse, whose eponymous F1 team was struggling to survive due to restrictions on alcohol and tobacco sponsorship caused by the Evin Law, to enter into negotiations with Driot over the possibility of Larrousse running the GD-01 instead of its planned Larrousse LH95 chassis--which it could not afford to build--or an updated LH94, which would be extremely uncompetitive due to modifications needed to comply with the rules. Driot refused to allow his chassis to be raced by another team unless he could have greater involvement; Larrousse eventually folded without contesting a single 1995 race. The chassis featured a triple bulkhead monocoque made of a composite of carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb, which was manufactured by the Lille-based SNPE company. The bodywork was quite bulky, as the sidepods housed large water and oil coolers. The GD-01 had a conventional suspension, featuring wishbones with pushrod- actuated shock absorbers. The car featured a low-nose configuration, which was gradually being abandoned in favour of higher noses by other F1 teams at the time, although the Reynard engineers had tested both configurations. The car's overall aerodynamic package has been described by motorsport author Sam Collins as \\"underdeveloped\\"., p. 10 The GD-01 was powered by a Ford Cosworth ED V8 engine--a new unit for the three-litre era of F1 that began in 1995-- which was a standard contemporary choice for smaller teams due to its low cost and ease of installation. The engine had a mileage of before rebuilds, a weight of , a rev limit of 13,500 rpm, and maximum power of at 13,200 rpm. It was initially thought that the chassis would be powered by a Mugen-Honda engine as part of a low-key return to F1 for Honda, but negotiations between the parties came to nought. The car's transmission was a six-speed sequential unit built specially for the team by British company Xtrac, which also supplied the team's differential. Xtrac gearboxes were also used in the Minardi M195 and Simtek S951 chassis in 1995. The car's electronics were supplied by Pi Research, its Goodyear-supplied tyres fitted on Enkei wheels, and it was fuelled with Elf petrol. Only one chassis was built., p. 122 Launch and testing history DAMS unveiled the GD-01 on the starting grid of the Circuit de la Sarthe in the late summer of 1995. The launch was attended by Driot, Galopin and Arnott, in addition to drivers Érik Comas, Emmanuel Collard and Jan Lammers. The car was presented in a blue, white and yellow scheme with minimal sponsorship; the stickers present on the car were from technical partners such as Elf. By this time, it was already obsolete as the monocoque did not fully comply with the 1995 regulations, but the team's engineers were confident that it could be modified in order to do so. The GD-01 was tested by Comas and Lammers at the Circuit Paul Ricard in the south of France in October. It proved to be off the pace due to its cautious bodywork and aerodynamic design, indicating that it would need a thorough development programme in order for it to compete effectively in F1, particularly with the introduction of the 107% rule--which prevented drivers who were too slow in relation to the pole position time from qualifying--for the 1996 season. However, the team's struggle to acquire a sufficient budget to race meant that Driot missed the deadline to apply for the 1996 championship. He hoped to apply for the 1997 season, but the continuing struggle to find financial backing, the increasing obsolescence of the GD-01's design, and the failure of the Simtek, Pacific and Forti teams to maintain an F1 team using the Cosworth ED engine, eventually persuaded him to abandon the venture altogether. Legacy Throughout the development, construction and testing of the GD-01, DAMS maintained its International Formula 3000 team, which survives to this day in FIA Formula 2 Championship. The sole GD-01 chassis is in the team's factory, whilst the car's design drawings and documentation are in the possession of Adrian Reynard., p. 12 The car's Xtrac transmission was subsequently used in the Dome F105, another F1 test project which was never entered in a Grand Prix. Reynard continued to expand its operations, designing the British American Racing team's first F1 cars from onwards, and moving into other series such as Champ Car, before filing for bankruptcy in 2002.

(\\"Jesus Christ.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica, Chicago, 2009.) \\"[Jesus] spent His boyhood in the Galilean town of Nazareth.\\" (Bromiley, Geoffrey W., \\"Nazarene,\\" The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P, pp. 499-500.) a town in Galilee, now in northern Israel. The word is used to translate two related terms that appear in the Greek New Testament: Nazarēnos (Nazarene) and Nazōraios (Nazorean). The phrases traditionally rendered as \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" can also be translated as \\"Jesus the Nazarene\\" or \\"Jesus the Nazorean\\",See Luke 18:37 and the title \\"Nazarene\\" may have a religious significance instead of denoting a place of origin. Both Nazarene and Nazorean are irregular in Greek and the additional vowel in Nazorean complicates any derivation from Nazareth.Bromiley, Geoffrey W., \\"Nazarene,\\" The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P, pp. 499-500. The Gospel of Matthew explains that the title Nazarene is derived from the prophecy \\"He will be called a Nazorean\\", but this has no obvious Old Testament source. Some scholars argue that it refers to a passage in the Book of Isaiah, with \\"Nazarene\\" a Greek reading of the Hebrew ne·tser (branch), understood as a messianic title.Miller, Fred P., Isaiah's Use of the word \\"Branch\\" or Nazarene\\" Others point to a passage in the Book of Judges which refers to Samson as a Nazirite, a word that is just one letter off from Nazarene in Greek.France, R. T., The Gospel of Matthew, pp. 92-93. See . The Septuagint gives \\"Nazirite\\" as ναζιραῖον, while Matthew gives Nazorean as Ναζωραῖος. It is also possible, that Nazorean signs Jesus as a ruler. Berghorn, M., Die Genesis Jesu Christi aber war so. Die Herkunft Jesu nach dem matthäischen Prolog (Mt 1,1-4,16), Göttingen 2019 The Greek New Testament uses \\"Nazarene\\" six times (Mark, Luke), while \\"Nazorean\\" is used 13 times (Matthew, Mark in some manuscripts, Luke, John, Acts). In the Book of Acts, \\"Nazorean\\" is used to refer to a follower of Jesus, i.e. a Christian, rather than an inhabitant of a town. \\"Notzrim\\" is the modern Hebrew word for Christians (No·tsri, נוֹצְרִי) and one of two words commonly used to mean \\"Christian\\" in Syriac (Nasrani) and Arabic (Naṣrānī, نصراني). Etymology Nazarene is anglicized from Greek Nazarēnos (Ναζαρηνός), a word applied to Jesus in the New Testament.See , , , and , . Several Hebrew words have been suggested as roots:Stephen Goranson, \\"Nazarenes,\\" Anchor Bible Dictionary, 4: 1049-1050; James F. Strange, \\"Nazareth,\\" Anchor Bible Dictionary, 4: 1050-1,051 Nazareth Nazareth the city is described as the childhood home of Jesus, in many languages employ the word Nazarene as a general designation for those of the Christian faith. The traditional view is that this word is derived from the Hebrew word for Nazareth (Nazara) that was used in ancient times.\\"The name has obvious reference to Nazareth,\\" (\\"Nazarene\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911.) Schaeder, H., \\"Nazarenos, Nazoraios\\" in G. Kittel, \\"Theological Dict. of the New Testament,\\" p. 874. Albright, W., \\"Nazareth and Nazoraean,\\" J. of Biblical Lit. 65:2 (June 1946), pp.397–401. \\"Nazareth\\", in turn, may be derived from either na·tsar, נָצַר, meaning \\"to watch,\\"The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon (1906/2003), p. 665. \\"Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew notserah, i.e., one guarding or watching.\\" (Easton's Bible Dictionary, (1897)). \\"...if the word Nazareth is be derived from Hebrew at all, it must come from this root [i.e. נֹצְרִ, nostri, to watch]\\" (Merrill, Selah, (1881) Galilee in the Time of Christ, p. 116. or from ne·tser, נֵ֫צֶר, meaning branch.\\"The etymology of Nazara is neser\\" (\\"Nazareth\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911.) \\"NAZARETH, NAZARENE - Place name meaning, 'branch.'\\" (Holman's Bible Dictionary, 1994.) \\"Generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew netser, a \\"shoot\\" or \\"sprout.\\" (Easton's Bible Dictionary, (1897)). The common Greek structure Iesous o Nazoraios (Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος) \\"Jesus the Nazarene/of Nazareth\\" is traditionally considered as one of several geographical names in the New Testament such as Loukios o Kurenaios (Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος) \\"Lucius the Cyrenian/Lucius of Cyrene,\\" Trofimos o Efesios (\\"Trophimus the Ephesian, Τρόφιμος ὁ Ἐφέσιος), Maria Magdalene (\\"Mary the woman of Magdala\\"), Saulos Tarseus (\\"Saul the Tarsian\\"), or many classical examples such as Athenagoras the Athenian (Ἀθηναγόρας ὁ Ἀθηναῖος). The Greek phrase usually translated as \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (iēsous o nazōraios) can be compared with three other places in the New Testament where the construction \\"of Nazareth\\" is used: Jesus is also referred to as \\"from Nazareth of Galilee\\": Similar is found in : Some consider \\"Jesus the Nazarene\\" more common in the Greek.\\"Although modern NT translations repeated references to 'Jesus of Nazareth', 'Jesus the Nazarene' is the more common form of words in the original Greek version.\\" (Wilson, Ian, (1984) Jesus: The Evidence, p. 67.) See, for example, Luke 18:37. The name \\"of Nazareth\\" is not used of anyone else, and outside the New Testament there is no reference to Nazareth. \\"Nazareth\\" and \\"Nazarene\\" are complementary only in Greek, where they possess the \\"z\\", or voiced alveolar fricative. In Semitic languages, \\"Nazarene\\" and its cognates Nazareth, Nazara, and Nazorean/Nazaraean possess the voiceless alveolar fricative corresponding to the \\"s\\" or \\"ts\\" sound. Voiced and voiceless sounds follow separate linguistic pathways. The Greek forms referring to Nazareth should therefore be Nasarene, Nasoraios, and Nasareth. The additional vowel (ω) in Nazorean makes this variation more difficult to derive, although a weak Aramaic vowel in \\"Nazareth\\" has been suggested as a possible source. Ne·tzer *ne·tser (נֵ֫צֶר, n-ts-r), pronounced nay'·tser, meaning \\"branch\\", \\"flower\\", or \\"offshoot\\". Derived from na·tsar. (See below.)Strong number 5342. Brown, Michael L., Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus, Volume 4, Baker Books, 2006. Jerome (c. 347 – 420) linked \\"Nazarene\\" to a verse in the Book of Isaiah, claiming that \\"Nazarene\\" was the Hebrew reading of a word scholars read as ne·tzer (branch).\\"For in the place where we read and translate, There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots, in the Hebrew idiom it is written thus, There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse and a Nazarene shall grow from his root.\\" (Jerome, Letter 47:7). The text from Isaiah is: In ancient Hebrew texts, vowels were not indicated, so a wider variety of readings was possible in Jerome's time. Here branch/Nazarene is metaphorically \\"descendant\\" (of Jesse, father of King David). Eusebius, a 4th-century Christian polemicist, also argued that Isaiah was the source of \\"Nazarene.\\" This prophecy by Isaiah was extremely popular in New Testament times and is also referred to in Romans and Revelation.Bauckham, Richard, Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church, p. 65. See and . Ancient usage The term Nazarene (Nazorean or Nazaraean) has been referred to in the Jewish Gospels particularly the Hebrew Gospel, the Gospel of the Nazarenes and the Gospel of Matthew. It is also referred to in the Gospel of Mark. The Anchor Bible Dictionary , Vol. 4. New York, NY : Doubleday , 1992. PP 1049-1052 Matthew Matthew consistently uses the variant \\"Nazorean\\". A link between Nazorean and Nazareth is found in Matthew: The passage presents difficulties; no prophecy such as \\"He shall be called a Nazorean\\" is known in Jewish scripture, and \\"Nazorean\\" is a new term, appearing here for the first time in association with Nazareth and, indeed, for the first time anywhere. Matthew's prophecy is often linked to Isaiah's. Although only Isaiah's prophecy gives \\"branch\\" as ne·tser, there are four other messianic prophecies where the word for branch is given as tze·mach., , , and . Matthew's phrase \\"spoken through the prophets\\" may suggest that these passages are being referred to collectively. In contrast, the phrase \\"through the prophet,\\" used a few verses above the Nazorean prophecy, refers to a specific Old Testament passage.Namely An alternative view suggests that a passage in the Book of Judges which refers to Samson as a Nazirite is the source for Matthew's prophecy. \\"Nazirite\\" is only one letter off from \\"Nazorean\\" in Greek. But the characterization of Jesus in the New Testament is not that of a typical Nazirite, and it is doubtful that Matthew intended a comparison between Jesus and the amoral Samson. But Nazorean can be a transliteration of the NZR, what also means \\"ruler\\" (s. Gen 49,26). So Jesus is the new ruler of Israel.Berghorn, M., Genesis Jesu Christi Mark The Gospel of Mark, considered the oldest gospel, consistently uses \\"Nazarene,\\" while scripture written later generally uses \\"Nazorean.\\" This suggests that the form more closely tied to \\"Nazareth\\" came first. Another possibility is that Mark used this form because the more explicitly messianic form was still controversial when he was writing. Before he was baptized, Mark refers to Jesus as \\"from Nazareth of Galilee,\\" whereas afterwards he is \\"the Nazarene\\". In a similar fashion, second century messianic claimant Simon bar Kokhba (Aramaic for \\"Simon, son of a star\\"), changed his name from Simon bar Kosiba to add a reference to the Star Prophecy.Bauckham, Jude, Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church, p. 64. The prophecy may be found at Patristic works After Tertullus (Acts 24:5), the second reference to \\"Nazarenes\\" (plural) comes from Tertullian (208), the third reference from Eusebius (before 324), then extensive references in Epiphanius of Salamis (375) and Jerome (circa 390). Epiphanius additionally is the first and only source to write of another group with a similar name, the \\"Nasarenes\\" of Gilead and Bashan in Trans-Jordan (Greek: Nasaraioi Panarion 18). Epiphanius clearly distinguishes this group from the Christian Nazarenes as a separate and different \\"pre-Christian\\" Jewish sect.Antti Marjanen, Petri Luomanen -Companion to Second Century Christian Heretics 2008 - Page 282 \\"Who Were Called Nazarenes? Epiphanius discusses the correct spelling of the term Nazarenes (Nazòraioi) in Pan. 29.5.6–29.6.1, emphasizing that the name does not refer to nazirites or to the pre-Christian heresy of the Nasarenes (cf. Pan.\\" Epiphanius' explanation is dismissed as a confusion by some scholars (Schoeps 1911, Schaeder 1942, Gaertner 1957), or a misidentification (Bugge).

But Josephus also writes that Galilee had 219 villages in all,Josephus, Vita, 45. so it is clear that most village names have gone unrecorded in surviving literature. Nazareth was overshadowed by nearby Japhia in his time, so Josephus might not have thought of it as a separate town.\\"Nazareth\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901-1906. The earliest known reference to Nazareth outside the New Testament and as a contemporary town is by Sextus Julius Africanus, who wrote around AD 200.Eusebius, Church History 1.7.14.

Shetach sent to him: 'From me, the holy city, to thee, Alexandria of Egypt (my sister). My husband (the Rabbis) dwelleth within thee and I am desolate.' He arose, went, and found himself in a certain inn, where great honour was shewn him. 'How beautiful is this Acsania!' (can mean inn or female innkeeper) Thereupon (Yeshu) observed, 'Rabbi, her eyes are narrow.' 'Wretch,' he rebuked him, 'dost thou thus engage thyself.' He sounded four hundred trumpets and excommunicated him. He came before him many times pleading, 'Receive me!' But he would pay no heed to him. One day he was reciting the Shema', when Yeshu came before him. He intended to receive him and made a sign to him. He thinking that it was to repel him, went, put up a brick, and worshipped it. 'Repent,' said he to him. He replied, 'I have thus learned from thee: He who sins and causes others to sin is not afforded the means of repentance.'

Dubourg, L'Invention de Jesus, Gallimard Paris 1987, II, p. 157. Pliny the Elder indicatesPliny the Elder, Natural Histories Book V, recopying reports drafted by Marcus Agrippa on the orders of Emperor Octavian Augustus Caesar. that the Nazerini lived not far from Apamea, in Syria in a city called Bambyx, Hierapolis or Mabog. However it is generally thought that this people has no connection to either Tertullus' description of Paul, nor to the later 4th century Nazarenes.Ray Pritz Nazarene Jewish Christianity: from the end of the New Testament 1988 p17 Pliny's Nazerini - While treating the name of the sect, we may deal here with a short notice by Pliny the Elder which has caused some confusion among scholars. .... Can Pliny's Nazerini be early Christians? The answer depends very much on the identification of his sources, and on this basis the answer must be an unequivocal No. It is generally acknowledged that Pliny drew heavily on official records and most likely on those drawn up for Augustus by Marcus Agrippa (d. 12 BC).[31] Jones has shown that this survey was accomplished between 30 and 20 BC [32] Any connection between the Nazerini and the Nazareni must, therefore, be ruled out, and we must not attempt to line this up with Epiphanius' Nazoraioi. [33]\\" Pritz, following Dussaud, connects Pliny's 1st century BCE Nazerini, to the 9th century CE Nusairis. Nazarenes, and Ephanius' Nasaraioi (4th century CE) The testimonies of Epiphanius, Philastrius, and Pseudo-Tertullian may all draw in part from the same lost anti-heretical works of Hippolytus of Rome, mentioned as the Syntagma by Photius, and Against all Heresies by Origen and Jerome.The Cambridge history of early Christian literature 2004 p146 Frances Margaret Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth \\"18 A large section is ... of the Syntagma when he argued that Epiphanius, Philastrius, and Ps.-Tertullian had all drawn on the Syntagma \\" Epiphanius uses the spelling nasaraioi (Νασαραῖοι), which he attempts to distinguish from the spelling nazoraios in parts of the New Testament, as a Jewish-Christian sect.Charles Hugh Hope Scobie John the Baptist 1964 \\"Epiphanius mentions a sect of Nasarenes (Nasaraioi), whom he carefully distinguishes from a Christian sect of Nazorenes (Nazoraioi) whom he also describes.2 The Nasarenes, we are told, existed prior to the time of Christ\\" According to the testimony of Epiphanius against the 4th century Nazarenes, he reports them as having pre-Christian origins. He writes: \\"(6,1) They did not call themselves Nasaraeans either; the Nasaraean sect was before Christ, and did not know Christ. 6,2 But besides, as I indicated, everyone called the Christians Nazoraeans,\\" (Adversus Haereses, 29.6).The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, translated Frank Williams p116 The sect was apparently centered in the areas of Coele-Syria, Galilee and Samaria, essentially corresponding to the long-defunct Kingdom of Israel.Encyclopædia Britannica, Nazarene article, Wm. Benton Publ., London, vol. 16, 1961 edition. According to Epiphanius they rejected temple sacrifice and the Law of Moses, but adhered to other Jewish practices. They are described as being vegetarian.Bashan and Galaatides (Panarion 18; 20, 3; 29, 6, 1; 19, 5) According to him they were Jews only by nationality who lived in Gilead, Basham, and the Transjordan. They revered Moses but, unlike the pro-Torah Nazoraeans, believed he had received different laws from those accredited to him. Epiphanius' testimony was accepted as accurate by some 19th-century scholars, including Wilhelm Bousset, Richard Reitzenstein and Bultmann. However Epiphanius testimony in this regard, which is second-hand, is in modern scholarship read with more awareness of his polemical objectives to show that the 4th century Nazarenes and Ebionites were not Christian.Antti Marjanen, Petri Luomanen A companion to second-century Christian \\"heretics\\" 2008 p281 \\"Because the ancient writers that explicitly deal with the Nazarenes, Epiphanius and Jerome, are from the fourth century and are known for often allowing their polemical interests and personal ambitions to dictate the contents of their presentations, it is no wonder that the role of the Nazarenes in second-century Christianity has been open to various interpretations.\\" Mandaeans The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran use the term Nasoraean in their scroll, the Haran Gawaitha, to describe their origins in, and migration from Jerusalem: \\"And sixty thousand Nasoraeans abandoned the Sign of the Seven and entered the Median Hills, a place where we were free from domination by all other races.\\"...Karen L. King What is Gnosticism? 2005 Page 140 Theories on the origins of the Mandaeans have varied widely. During the 19th century Wilhelm Bousset, Richard Reitzenstein and Rudolf Bultmann argued that the Mandaeans were pre-Christian, as a parallel of Bultmann's theory that Gnosticism predated the Gospel of John.Edwin M.

Galloway's work is intended to be functional, yet also beautiful. To Galloway, beauty is as valid as function, and she delights in making pottery that is “joyous to use and decorates” our living spaces with “character and elegance.”Brinkley, Jeff. 1998. Julia Galloway. Ceramics Monthly, 46(10): 63. The objects are meant to be appreciated both through vision and touch; to be lived with and valued for their tactile nature as much as their visual appeal.Mathieu, Paul. 2000. The pottery of extremes: the work of Julia Galloway. Art & Perception, 42: 3-7. While they initially appear to be simple and familiar, they are noted by other artists to be very complex. Most notable about Galloway's forms has been her nesting of vessels within baskets and trays.Watten, Judy. 2004. Upfront: Julia Galloway. Ceramics Monthly, 52(7): 20-22. Joining forms together, she presents them as pairs, groups or stacks. Her pairs are mirrors of each other or nestling bedmates, sometimes slightly awkward, but well matched. Her cream and sugar “beds,” reference the domestic. Some of her creamers rest on pillowy mattresses, while others stand tall on top of smaller partners. The trays and baskets are slab- constructed with raw grogged stoneware, which plays against the colorful, smoothly-glazed porcellaneous stonewares they contain. Having containers within containers and not bases or sconces, locates the work within the sphere of the decorative, in the domain of “display.” Their role is to protect, situate and define a place for the object to operate – they tell us where they belong. Like a painting within a frame, these frame the pots, reinforcing their meaning within the realm of function. Influenced by Minoan ceramics, Sung and Tang dynasty court ware, as well as Persian miniature paintings, her work references human form and domestic architecture with form, and recalls floral patterning and organic decoration. Most of her objects are made by combining wheel-thrown and handbuilt elements “to expose the sculptural nature of pottery, and the seductive nature of porcelain.” She primarily fires her objects in a kiln, for its skin surface qualities and allowing for layering of decoration. Her work, typically ranging between 4-20 inches in length and 6-18 in height, appear much smaller and more intimate than their images in photographs would have you believe. Their nature is contained architectural spaces is which explode, with forms within forms, thus condensing their quiet power. Yet the work isn't quiet and understated. On the contrary, their forms are somewhat “exaggerated, their surface bold, colorful, complex, and often, challenging.” Many of her pieces border on erotic with their folds, curves, and bulges, and touch is reemphasized and reinforced by lush, juicy, drippy and wet glazes.

Since 2015, he has worked for The Washington Post. Weigel previously covered politics for Slate and Bloomberg Politics and is a contributing editor for Reason magazine. Early years and background Weigel was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware. After moving to England in 1998, he graduated from the American Community School in Cobham, Surrey, in \\"the high Tory London suburbs\\" of the London commuter belt, in 2000. He moved to Chicago in 2000 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in 2004 from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, with a double major in journalism and political science and a minor in history. While at college, Weigel wrote for The Daily Northwestern and was editor-in-chief of the campus conservative newspaper Northwestern Chronicle. Political affiliations In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Weigel voted for Ralph Nader, and served as a Delaware college elector for Nader.\\"Who's Getting Your Vote?\\". Reason. In the 2004 election, Weigel voted for John Kerry. Weigel later wrote that \\"[he regrets] the Nader vote, but not the Kerry vote, as a weak Democratic president with a conservative Congress would have been pretty tolerable in retrospect\\". He voted for Jack Ryan in the Illinois United States Senate election, 2004 Republican primary. In early 2007, Weigel became a registered Republican in the Washington, D.C. area,http://twitpic.com/2jstwd in order to vote for Ron Paul at the Republican primary stage of the 2008 presidential election. In November 2008, Weigel voted for Barack Obama, explaining \\"I really don't think McCain has the temperament to be President or the interest in standing up to a Democratic Congress....I've got the luxury of a guilt-free, zero-impact vote in the District of Columbia, which I would cast for Bob Barr if he was on the ballot\\". In January 2011, Weigel stated that he had voted for Republican Patrick Mara in elections to the Council of the District of Columbia, and that he had voted for Mara \\"every time he's been on the ballot\\". In the Republican Party presidential primaries 2012, Weigel voted for Jon Huntsman, despite his having withdrawn from the race, because \\"If you looked past his whiff of a tax plan (Huntsman recommended using the flat rates that Simpson and Bowles recommended not using), the guy had a few good ideas.\\" In the 2012 general election, Weigel voted for Gary Johnson. Career Weigel began his professional career as an editorial assistant and researcher for the USA Today editorial page and as a reporter for Campaigns & Elections. He has contributed articles to Slate, The Daily Beast, Time, The Guardian, The American Prospect, The American Spectator, The Washington Monthly, The American Conservative, Politico, and The Nation. He has appeared on NPR's Fresh Air and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show. Weigel has also blogged for The Economist's \\"Democracy in America\\" blog, and guest-blogged for Andrew Sullivan's \\"Daily Dish\\" blog at The Atlantic. His book The Show That Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog Rock was published in June 2017.Prog Rock Gets Some Respect In 'The Show That Never Ends'. Jason Heller, National Public Radio, 13 June 2017 Weigel is a contributing editor of the libertarian Reason magazine and was one of its staff political writers from 2006 to 2008. He wrote for The Washington Independent from November 2008 until early 2010 and was one of the \\"best sourced\\" reporters there, according to Michael Calderone of Politico. The Washington Post After working for the Washington Independent, Weigel took a job writing the \\"Right Now\\" column on the Washington Post website, focusing on the conservative movement. Weigel told Politico that \\"If readers get a deeper understanding of these people, their strategy, and their ideas, then I'm doing my job.\\" The national editor of The Washington Post said Weigel was hired to add a voice to the paper's online politics coverage. Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post said the online columns were supposed to contain a mixture of reporting and opinion. Weigel was criticized by conservatives for tweets that he made on May 2, 2010, that disparaged news editor Matt Drudge, and that called opponents of same-sex marriage \\"bigots\\". Penny Nance of conservative group Concerned Women for America responded that Weigel's \\"arrogance disqualifies him as a serious journalist assigned to covering conservatives.\\" Politics Daily noted that The Washington Posts guidelines require Post journalists to \\"refrain from writing, tweeting or posting anything ... that could be perceived as reflecting political, racial, sexist, religious or other bias or favoritism that could be used to tarnish our journalistic credibility.\\" Weigel apologized on May 3. =Controversy over leaked e-mails and resignation from The Washington Post= In late June 2010, excerpts of several of Weigel's private emails from JournoList were posted online by the website Fishbowl DC and later by Tucker Carlson's conservative news site, The Daily Caller. JournoList had been started in 2007 by Ezra Klein as an invitation-only discussion and debate forum for left-of-center bloggers and reporters. The excerpts of Weigel's archived emails contained negative remarks about various public figures associated with American conservatism such as Pat Buchanan, Matt Drudge, Newt Gingrich, and Rush Limbaugh. Weigel said all of the emails were sent before he joined The Washington Post. He apologized online before the second round of email excerpts was published on the Tucker Carlson site, explaining that he had thought the off-the-record listserv environment was a place where he could \\"talk bluntly to friends\\". However, The Washington Post responded that the apology could not save his job because \\"the damage was too severe.\\" Jim Geraghty of the National Review Online wrote that \\"there was definitely a perception that his blog was designed to make conservatives look bad.\\" As a result of the leaked emails, Weigel resigned from The Washington Post and Ezra Klein shut down JournoList. The executive editor of The Washington Post said the paper \\"can't have any tolerance for the perception that people are conflicted or bring a bias to their work.” Journalist Marc Ambinder of the Atlantic said Weigel was forced to resign under an \\"old media,\\" \\"non-ideological standard that just doesn't exist\\". In closing down JournoList, Klein said it had \\"become a weapon, and insofar as people's careers are now at stake, it has to die\\". Describing Weigel as \\"an idiosyncratic libertarian who likes some politicians and media figures, and not others\\", Klein said that Weigel's \\"likes and dislikes do not fall neatly across party lines\\". Remarking that leaked information can show only a partial, cherry picked truth, and that it can be just plain wrong, Klein said that if other emails had been chosen, Weigel could have been made to look like a conservative extremist. After the Post Weigel began appearing on MSNBC in 2009. On June 28, 2010, Keith Olbermann announced that Weigel was joining MSNBC as a news contributor. Politico, listing Weigel as one of the \\"50 politicos to watch\\", commented that \\"Weigel may have lost a blogging job with The Washington Post over his leaked e-mails to an off-the-record liberal e-mail list, but he didn't exactly damage his career. If anything, the enthusiastic endorsements of his reporting skills after he left the Post last month brought Weigel to the attention of a wider audience than the relatively small group of conservative activists and the reporters who write about them for whom Weigel has long been a must-read\\" and that he expected to sign on to \\"some outlet that has a big online presence\\" by the end of July. In August 2010, Weigel joined Slate magazine (owned by The Washington Post) as a political reporter. Weigel said \\"This is the magazine that invented the sort of journalism I want to do\\", he continued, \\"And I'm very pleased that I'll get to continue working the beat I developed at the Post, the Independent, and Reason.\\" Weigel ran a blog covering politics, focusing largely but not exclusively on the conservative movement, his area of expertise. He also wrote long-form pieces, including a multi-part series on progressive rock. In September 2014, Weigel left Slate in preparation for a new job at Bloomberg Politics. Return to the Post David Weigel playing video games with Senator Cory Booker as part of an interview at The Washington Post in 2018 After only nine months at Bloomberg Politics, Weigel returned to The Washington Post on July 20, 2015. His beat was to cover grassroots movements as part of the Posts presidential coverage. On December 8, 2017, Weigel tweeted a photo of the crowd at President Donald Trump's rally at the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida that showed many empty seats. He quickly deleted the tweet after it was pointed out that the photo was taken before the venue filled up. Trump addressed the incident the next day on his Twitter account and demanded that Weigel be fired. Weigel replied and apologized, writing \\"Was confused by the image of you walking in the bottom right corner.\\" Personal life Weigel was mentioned in a 2006 article in The New York Times about bloggers who roomed together. At that time, he shared a house with fellow Reason.com writer Julian Sanchez that they had dubbed \\"Casa de Libertarios\\". He lives in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

It operates a bookstore and office- supplies store chain of the same name. History Early history The history of National Book Store can be traced back to the 1930s. However, the company has been formally established in 1942. Before the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, José Ramos and Socorro Cáncio-Ramos, rented a small-corner space of a Haberdashery situated at the foot of Escolta Bridge in Santa Cruz, Manila. With a starting capital of (equivalent to in 2015), the Ramoses set up their first retail bookstore selling GI novels, text books and supplies. During World War II, the store shifted to selling sold candies, soap, and slippers due to stringent book censorship. The store experienced success but was burned down during the 1945 Battle of Manila, rebuilt again and reverted to selling textbooks and stationery, the opening of the rebuilt National Book Store at the corner of Soler Street and Avenida Rizal, coincided with the first academic schoolyear after the war. In 1948, the store was destroyed by a Typhoon Gene but a new two storey building with a mezzanine was built to host National Book Store. National Book Store began selling greeting cards in the 1950s depicting Philippine subjects to showcase local culture and traditions. The book store also launched a publishing program with international publishers such as McGraw-Hill, Prentice Hal, Lippincott, Addison-Wesley. In 1955, the Ramoses were able to acquire a lot owned by the Guerrero family, where they erected the nine-storey Albercer Building in 1963 which was named after Alfredo, Benjamin, and Cecilia, where a National Book Store was hosted. National Book Store accumulated enough capital after some several years to acquire rights to reprint foreign brand greeting cards for the Philippine market. The book store had rights to reprint cards by Gibson for a few years. In 1973, outbid a more established competitor for a Philippine franchise of the greeting card brand, Hallmark. Expansion and recent history National Book Store in SM Aura Premier, BGC The Ramoses children proposed expanding the scope of National Book Store, and a branch along Recto Avenue was opened, an area often frequented by students. In the 1970s, branches were opened in shopping malls in Makati and Cubao, Quezon City. For the next decades since the opening of the Recto branch, the book store grew with shopping mall owners approaching the Ramoses to set up a store inside their properties. National Book Store became one of the top 100 Philippine corporations in 1988, registering profits of $1 million on gross revenues of $34.7 million. The book store chain also became one of the Top 500 of the list by Retail Asia-Pacific, ranking 308th in 2004. In 2015, National Book Store captures the majority of the Philippine book market having a share amounting to 80 percent, and operates around 127 branches across the Philippines. It also operates Metrobooks, which opened in Hong Kong in 2007, a subsidiary based in the former British crown colony. With the pending entry of National Book Store into the Philippine Stock Exchange through the renaming of Vulcan Industrial & Mining Corp., another Ramos-owned company, into National Book Store Retail Corp. they would now also venture into wholesale, publishing, printing, manufacturing, and distribution. It entered the education industry in 2017 with the launch of NBS College, its first institution for higher learning at the National Book Store building on Quezon Avenue. By 2018, it now has over 230 branches nationwide. Subsidiaries Among National Book Store subsidiaries are Powerbooks, a specialty store for books, and Metrobooks, a book store based in Hong Kong. Anvil Publishing serves as its publishing arm. In late 2016, they launched three new specialty stores: Art Bar, for arts and crafts; Noteworthy, for stationery and gift items; and Work Station, for office supplies and equipment. Brand image Typical store interior The brand name of National Book Store was thought of by Socorro Ramos, one of the co-founders. No marketing research was conducted and was done on Ramos' impulse taking the book store name from the National Cash Register machine, a brand which was popular at the time of the book store's founding. For fifty years from the book store's establishment, the logo designed by Ramos herself was used which consists of the name of the store in a white background on a surrounded by a red and white stripe design. Ramos first came up with a logo by placing the store's name in a striped wrapper with her children finding the logo satisfactory. A new logo was adopted in 1996 following a proposal from Ramos' children and grandchildren which features the store's name in a more modern font in a red background. In a voting made within the company, 15 voted for adopting the new logo with only Ramos herself voting against the change. The new logo design was a commissioned work by a Singapore-based company which also came up with a new store lay-out design. A new store design was executed in 2016, starting with its branch in SM City North EDSA. National Book Store collaborated with French design firm Malherbe for a new and more modern and contemporary design for their book store outlets.

On 14 April 1945, at Montese, three Brazilian soldiers on patrol, Arlindo Lúcio da Silva, Geraldo Baeta da Cruz, and Rodrigues de Souza, were attacked by German forces, who called upon them to surrender (including their own leaders/higher ups); the three men took cover and fired on the enemy until running out of ammunition. They fixed bayonets and advanced, but were killed. In recognition of the bravery of the soldiers, the Germans buried them and erected a cross over their grave with the inscription \\"Drei Brasilianische Helden\\" (\\"Three Brazilian heroes\\").http://cinemarketingfilmes.blogspot.com/2009/09/novo-filme-da- cinemarketing.html There is a monument honouring the three men of the patrol and the Brazilian mountain infantry.

The brigade was formed in May 1942, by the conversion of the 6th Motor Brigade and was assigned to the 2nd Motor Division. The brigade also absorbed units of the 5th Motor Brigade in June 1942. The brigade remained in Australia and did not see any active service before it was converted into the 4th Armoured Brigade in March 1943. History The 6th Armoured Brigade was a Militia, or Citizens Military Force (CMF), formation, the only one of its kind raised during the Second World War. Its lineage begins with the 6th Cavalry Brigade, which was formed in South Australia from the existing Militia 8th Light Horse Brigade in the reorganisation of the Australian Army in 1921. Upon the declaration of war in 1939, the brigade was placed on a war footing. Following the invasion of Malaya, bombing of Pearl Harbor, and fall of Singapore, the 6th was called up for full-time service in Australia. The evolution of Australia's mounted forces, the Australian Light Horse, had lagged well behind that of other countries who had converted their horse mounted cavalry to motorised (trucks) or mechanised (armoured fighting vehicles) forces. Consequently, the 6th Cavalry Brigade became the 6th Motor Brigade in February 1942, and its subordinate units were also motorised. However, this was short lived and most units never completed the process of motorisation. As part of the broader mechanisation and motorisation of the 2nd Motor Division, which would become the 2nd Armoured Division, the brigade was converted to a mechanised formation, the 6th Armoured Brigade in May 1942, joining the 3rd Motor Brigade and other divisional troops. After moving to Geelong in June, the brigade absorbed several units from the disbanded 5th Motor Brigade. The brigade was concentrated at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School, Puckapunyal, in July, where it received US M3 Medium Grant tanks to train with. The brigade proceeded to conduct driving and maintenance, signalling, gunnery, navigation, leadership and tactics training and by the end of 1942 had reached a high standard of efficiency. By December 1942, the strategic situation had changed again as the Japanese advance had been halted following the battles of the Coral Sea, Guadalcanal and those in New Guinea. It was clear that the large numbers of armoured formations created for the Defence of Australia were no longer needed. Conversely, the demand for reinforcements for the Australian units fighting in New Guinea was increasing. Moreover, the Army was reorganising its units to fight in the jungle. Consequently, the 2nd Armoured Division was ordered to disband in February 1943. The 6th Armoured Brigade headquarters would form the basis of a new tropical warfare establishment armoured formation, the 4th Armoured Brigade. Its units however, would either be disbanded or transferred to other formations. Structure The 6th Armoured Brigade included regiments raised from the CMF in both South Australia and Victoria, its organisation was: * 6th Armoured Brigade Headquarters (formerly 6th Cavalry Brigade Headquarters) * 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron (3rd Light Horse) * 12th Armoured Regiment (formerly the 18th Light Horse) * 13th Armoured Regiment (formerly the 13th Light Horse) * 14th Armoured Regiment (formerly 104th Motor Regiment, 4th Armoured Regiment and originally C Squadron, 17th Light Horse) * 9th Motor Regiment (formerly 9th Light Horse) * 23rd Reconnaissance Company (formerly 23rd Light Horse) was disbanded in May 1942.

The site is also an important habitat for endangered animal species such as the snow leopard. - id=\\"Western Caucasus\\"  Western Caucasus  150px  Krasnodar Krai and Adygea  1999  ix, x  900  –  The Western Caucasus, extending over 275,000 ha of the extreme western end of the Caucasus mountains and located 50 km north-east of the Black Sea, is one of the few large mountain areas of Europe that has not experienced significant human impact. Its subalpine and alpine pastures have only been grazed by wild animals, and its extensive tracts of undisturbed mountain forests, extending from the lowlands to the subalpine zone, are unique in Europe. The site has a great diversity of ecosystems, with important endemic plants and wildlife, and is the place of origin and reintroduction of the mountain subspecies of the European bison. - id=\\"Bikin River Valley\\"  Central Sikhote-Alin  150px  Primorsky Krai  2001, 2018 (Extended)  x  766bis  –  The Sikhote-Alin mountain range contains one the richest and most unusual temperate forests of the world. In this mixed zone between taiga and subtropics, southern species such as the tiger and Himalayan bear cohabit with northern species such as the brown bear and lynx. The site stretches from the peaks of Sikhote-Alin to the Sea of Japan and is important for the survival of many endangered species such as the Amur tiger. The Bikin River Valley is a serial extension of the existing Central Sikhote-Alin site, inscribed in 2001 on the World Heritage List. It is located about 100 km to the north of the existing property. The extension covers an area of 1,160,469 hectares, three times larger than the existing site. It encompasses the South-Okhotsk dark coniferous forests and the East- Asian coniferous broadleaf forests. The fauna includes species of the taiga alongside southern Manchurian species.

It takes its name from Uvs Nuur Lake, a large, shallow and very saline lake, important for migrating birds, waterfowl and seabirds. The site is made up of twelve protected areas representing the major biomes of eastern Eurasia. The steppe ecosystem supports a rich diversity of birds and the desert is home to a number of rare gerbil, jerboas and the marbled polecat. The mountains are an important refuge for the globally endangered snow leopard, mountain sheep (argali) and the Asiatic ibex. - id=\\"Wrangel Island\\"  Natural System of Wrangel Island Reserve  150px  Chukotka Autonomous Okrug  2004  ix, x  1023  –  Located well above the Arctic Circle, the site includes the mountainous Wrangel Island (7,608 km2), Herald Island (11 km2) and surrounding waters. Wrangel was not glaciated during the Quaternary Ice Age, resulting in exceptionally high levels of biodiversity for this region. The island boasts the world’s largest population of Pacific walrus and the highest density of ancestral polar bear dens. It is a major feeding ground for the grey whale migrating from Mexico and the northernmost nesting ground for 100 migratory bird species, many endangered. Currently, 417 species and subspecies of vascular plants have been identified on the island, double that of any other Arctic tundra territory of comparable size and more than any other Arctic island. Some species are derivative of widespread continental forms, others are the result of recent hybridization, and 23 are endemic. - id=\\"Putorana Plateau\\"  Putorana Plateau  150px  Krasnoyarsk Krai  2010  vii, ix  1234  –  This site coincides with the area of the Putoransky State Nature Reserve, and is located in the central part of the Putorana Plateau in northern Central Siberia.

They were produced by the region's extreme continental climate with an annual temperature range of almost 100 degrees Celsius (from –60 °C in winter to +40 °C in summer). The pillars form rocky buttresses isolated from each other by deep and steep gullies developed by frost shattering directed along intervening joints. Penetration of water from the surface has facilitated cryogenic processes (freeze-thaw action), which have widened gullies between pillars leading to their isolation. Fluvial processes are also critical to the pillars. The site also contains a wealth of Cambrian fossil remains of numerous species, some of them unique. - id=\\"Landscapes of Dauria\\" Landscapes of Dauriashared with Mongolia 150px Zabaykalsky Krai  2017  ii, iv  1525  16th century on Shared with Mongolia, this site is an outstanding example of the Daurian Steppe eco-region, which extends from eastern Mongolia into Russian Siberia and northeastern China. Cyclical climate changes, with distinct dry and wet periods lead to a wide diversity of species and ecosystems of global significance. The different types of steppe ecosystems represented, such as grassland and forest, as well as lakes and wetlands serve as habitats for rare species of fauna, such as the White-naped crane, Great Bustard, Relict Gull and Swan goose. It is also a critical site on the transboundary migration path for the Mongolian gazelle. -\\"sortbottom\\" !colspan=8Cultural - id=\\"Saint Petersburg\\"  Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments  150px  Saint Petersburg  1990  i, ii, iv, vi  540  18th century on  The 'Venice of the North', with its numerous canals and more than 400 bridges, is the result of a vast urban project begun in 1703 under Peter the Great.

The convent provides an example of the highest accomplishments of Russian architecture with rich interiors and an important collection of paintings and artefacts. - id=\\"Yaroslavl\\"  Historic Centre of the City of Yaroslavl  150px  data-sort-value=\\"Yaroslavl Oblast\\"  Yaroslavl, Yaroslavl Oblast  2005  ii, iv  1170  16th century on  Situated at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl Rivers some 250 km north-east of Moscow, the historic city of Yaroslavl developed into a major commercial centre from the 11th century. It is renowned for its numerous 17th-century churches and is an outstanding example of the urban planning reform Empress Catherine the Great ordered for the whole of Russia in 1763. While keeping some of its significant historic structures, the town was renovated in the neoclassical style on a radial urban master plan. It has also kept elements from the 16th century in the Spassky Monastery, one of the oldest in the Upper Volga region, built on the site of a pagan temple in the late 12th century but reconstructed over time. - id=\\"Struve Geodetic Arc\\"  Struve Geodetic Arc shared with Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Sweden, Ukraine  150px  data- sort-value=\\"Leningrad Oblast\\"  Gogland, Leningrad Oblast  2005  ii, iii, vi  1187  19th century  The Struve Arc is a chain of survey triangulations stretching from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea, through 10 countries and over 2,820 km. These are points of a survey, carried out between 1816 and 1855 by the astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve, which represented the first accurate measuring of a long segment of a meridian. This helped to establish the exact size and shape of the planet and marked an important step in the development of earth sciences and topographic mapping. It is an extraordinary example of scientific collaboration among scientists from different countries, and of collaboration between monarchs for a scientific cause. The original arc consisted of 258 main triangles with 265 main station points. The listed site includes 34 of the original station points, with different markings, i.e. a drilled hole in rock, iron cross, cairns, or built obelisks. - id=\\"Bolgar\\"  Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex  150px  Tatarstan  2014  ii, iv  981  13th century on  This property lies on the shores of the Volga River, south of its confluence with the River Kama, and south of the capital of Tatarstan, Kazan. It contains evidence of the medieval city of Bolgar, an early settlement of the civilization of Volga-Bolgars, which existed between the 7th and the 15th centuries, and was the first capital of the Golden Horde in the 13th century. Bolgar represents the historical cultural exchanges and transformations of Eurasia over several centuries that played a pivotal role in the formation of civilizations, customs and cultural traditions.

Plot Katrien (Cherié van der Merwe) is dumped by her boyfriend, high school rugby star Werner (Altus Theart), so he can focus his energy on the sport. To get even, she makes a bet with her friends that she can make a star out of the school's dorkiest boy, Wimpie Koekemoer (Ivan Botha), by pretending to be his girlfriend. The awkward Koekemoer rises to the challenge but Katrien finds herself falling unexpectedly in love with him, until he realizes she is merely using him. Production The film was shot on location in Pretoria and Johannesburg in 2007. Local high schools Waterkloof and Eldoraigne participated in the production and the 2007 teams of both schools play the high school rugby teams in the film. These students, and the students who appear as extras, are all credited at the end of the film. Most of the cast, according to reviewer Kgomotso Moncho, were recruited from the Tshwane University of Technology, where many of the high school scenes were filmed. This was the first film by director Pretorius, a television actor who had appeared as a regular cast member of the South African soapie Kruispad, and played in an episode of the HBO miniseries Generation Kill. Bakgat! received mixed reviews, described by critics as amusing but clichéd. Shaun de Waal described it as \\"an efficient attempt to replicate the American teen comedy,\\" criticized it as \\"largely predictable\\" and deriding its use of cartoonish stock characters such as \\"a mincing moffie thrown in for laughs.\\" Sequels Two sequels, Bakgat! 2 (2010) and Bakgat! tot die mag 3 (2013) have been released. The filming of Bakgat! 2 began in 2009 at the Potchefstroom Campus of North-West University, with Henk Pretorius returning as director and Botha and van de Merwe returning in their roles as Wimpie and Katrien.

Rooted in the post-punk movement of the late 1970s, the movement spanned a wide variety of styles and artists, including acts such as Orange Juice, the Human League and ABC. The term \\"rockist\\", a pejorative against people who shunned this type of music, coincided and was associated with New Pop.Harvel, Jess. \\"Now That's What I Call New Pop!\\". Pitchfork Media. 12 September 2005. \\"New Music\\" is a roughly equivalent but slightly more expansive umbrella term for a pop music and cultural phenomenon in the US associated with the Second British Invasion. The term was used by the music industry and by American music journalists during the 1980s to characterize \\"new\\" movements like New Pop and New Romanticism. Characteristics Many New Pop artists created music that sweetened less commercial and experimental aspects with a pop coating. Entryism became a popular concept for groups at the time. New Music acts were danceable, had an androgynous look, emphasized the synthesizer and drum machines, wrote about the darker side of romance, and were British. They rediscovered rockabilly, Motown, ska, reggae and merged it with African rhythms to produce what was described as a \\"fertile, stylistic cross-pollination\\". Author Simon Reynolds noted that the New Pop movement \\"involved a conscious and brave attempt to bridge the separation between 'progressive' pop and mass/chart pop – a divide which has existed since 1967, and is also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\\" The term \\"New Music\\" or \\"New Pop\\" was used loosely to describe synthpop groups such as the Human League, soul-disco acts such as ABC, new wave acts such as Elvis Costello and the Pretenders, jangle pop bands such as Orange Juice, and American MTV stars such as Michael Jackson. Stephen Holden of the New York Times wrote at the time that New Music was more about its practitioners than their sound. Teenage girls and males that had grown tired of traditional \\"phallic\\" guitar driven rock embraced New Music. New Music was a singles oriented (both 7 inch and the then new 12 inch) phenomenon, reverting the 1970s rock music album orientation. Etymology During the late 1970s, \\"New Musick\\" was one of the labels that was applied to certain post-punk groups. The term \\"post-punk\\" was also deployed interchangeably with \\"new wave\\". In the New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock (2001), \\"new wave\\" is described as a \\"virtually meaningless\\" term. By the early 1980s, British journalists had largely abandoned \\"new wave\\" in favor of other terms such as \\"synthpop\\", and in 1983, the term of choice for the US music industry had become \\"new music\\". History Producer and New Musical Express writer Paul Morley (left), a pivotal figure in New Pop In the wake of the punk rock explosion of the late 1970s, the new wave and post-punk genres emerged, informed by a desire for experimentation, creativity and forward movement. Music journalist Paul Morley, whose writing in British music magazine the NME championed the post-punk movement in late 1970s, has been credited as an influential voice in the development of New Pop following the dissipation of post-punk, advocating \\"overground brightness\\" over underground sensibilities. Around this time, the term \\"rockist\\" would gain popularity to disparagingly describe music that privileged traditionalist rock styles. According to Pitchforks Jess Harvel: \\"If new pop had an architect, it was [the writer] Paul Morley.\\" As the 1980s began, a number of musicians desired to broaden these movements to reach a more mainstream audience. In 1980, the New Music Seminar made its debut. It was designed to help young new wave artists gain entrance into the American music industry. The event grew rapidly in popularity and encouraged the shift away from the use of \\"new wave\\" to \\"New Music\\" in the United States.Cateforis pp. 43-44 A similar shift occurred in Great Britain where \\"new wave\\" was replaced with \\"New Romantic\\" and \\"New Pop\\". Unlike in Great Britain, attempts prior to 1982 to bring new wave and the music video to American audiences had brought mixed results. During 1982, New Music acts began to appear on the charts in the United States, and clubs there that played them were packed. In reaction to New Music, album-oriented rock radio stations doubled the amount of new acts they played and the format \\"Hot Hits\\" emerged. By 1983, in a year when half of the new artists came out of New Music,Cateforis p. 57 acts such as Duran Duran, Culture Club and Men at Work were dominating the charts and creating an alternate music and cultural mainstream. Annie Lennox and Boy George were the two figures most associated with New Music. Criticism and decline Criticism of New Pop emerged from both supporters of traditional rock and newer experimental rock. These critics looked at New Pop as pro corporate at expense of rock music's anti- authoritarian tradition. Critics believed New Pop's embrace of synths and videos were ways of covering in many cases lack of talent. The heavy metal magazine Hit Parader regularly used the homophobic slur \\"faggot\\" to describe New Music musicians. The 1985 Dire Straits song \\"Money for Nothing\\", which hit number 1 in the United States, contained the line \\"The little faggot with the earring and the make-up\\" and used the term \\"faggot\\" several other times. The lyrics were taken verbatim from the language of a New York appliance store worker whom lead singer Mark Knopfler had observed watching MTV. Assistant professor/author/musician Theo Cateforis stated these are examples of homophobia used in the defense of \\"real rock\\" against new music.Cateforis p. 233 reference number 28 Richard Blade, a disc jockey at Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, speaking of the late 1980s said, \\"You felt there was a winding-down of music. Thomas Dolby's album had bombed, Duran Duran had gone through a series of breakups, The Smiths had broken up, Spandau Ballet had gone away, and people were just shaking their heads going, 'What happened to all this new music?' \\" Theo Cateforis contends that the New Music evolved into modern rock that while different, retained New Music's uptempo feel and still came from the rock disco/club scene.Cateforis pp. 65-67 References Bibliography * * * Further reading *Rimmer, Dave.

He is now best known for his controversial fictionalised autobiography The Dark Monarch, which was withdrawn just days after publication in 1962 following legal action. The book became the theme of an exhibition in Tate St Ives in autumn 2009 when it was re-published. Early life Berlin was born and grew up in Sydenham, south-east London, in a conventional household for the time,Chris Stevens \\"Sven Berlin\\" obituary, The Guardian, 4 January 2000 though he was obliged to leave school due to financial pressures at the age of twelve, pursuing a successful career as an adagio dancer until his mid-twenties, where he met his first wife, Helga. First marriage and Second World War In 1938 he moved to Cornwall to develop his artistic skills, and came under the influence of Dr Frank Turk, an Exeter University educationalist, and attended lectures on philosophy, ancient cultures and the arts. A son, Paul, and daughter, Janet (who later adopted the name Greta), were born in Cornwall. In the Second World War Berlin registered as a conscientious objector, and worked in the market garden established by the art critic Adrian Stokes at Little Park Owles, Carbis Bay, outside St Ives, where he met fellow artists Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth. He also began research into the naive artist Alfred Wallis, and his book, the first profile to be written, was eventually published by Tambimuttu's Poetry London in 1949. Berlin later renounced his position as a conscientious objector after observing some distressing naval bombing in the English ChannelPeter Davies, Obituary: Sven Berlin, The Independent, 17 December 1999 and joined the Army, taking part in the D-Day landings as a Forward Observer in France, Holland and Belgium. As well as writing about his experiences to Adrian Stokes, he also produced a series of pen and ink drawings of army life, local people and children caught up in the War. A breakdown led to his return, culminating in a divorce soon afterwards. St Ives Berlin was a member of the burgeoning artistic community around St Ives on his return and met a local girl, Jacqueline Moran,ATK, \\"Sven Berlin 1911 – 1999\\", finpubs-dwh on demonweb.co.uk, no date (accessed 27 January 2012) with whom he moved into a cottage provided by the writer Mabel Lethbridge. He met his second wife, the artist Juanita Fisher in 1949 while living in a small concrete building next to Porthgwidden Beach, dubbed The Tower. Here he became something of a tourist attraction, carving stone outside, stripped to the waist. Among commissions he illustrated Peggy Pollard's book Cornwall and also exhibited in 1946 at the Lefevre Gallery in London among others. His friendship with writer Denys Val Baker led to numerous contributions to and illustrations of his work in the literary magazine Cornish Review. Exhibiting paintings, drawings and sculpture regularly with the St. Ives Society of Artists and in London, Berlin was a founding member of the Crypt Group of modern-minded young artists, along with Peter Lanyon, John Wells and Bryan Wynter, and of the Penwith Society of Arts for a short time, before leaving the group following a much publicised rift between the Modernists, led by Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth on one side and the more representational artists on the other. This artistic clash of egos was the inspiration for The Dark Monarch. Berlin's increasing isolation after he was forced to leave his studio, when the council decided to build new conveniences on the site, led to the Berlins' departure for the New Forest in 1953 after their marriage and the birth of their son, Jasper. New Forest Berlin and Juanita settled in the New Forest in Hampshire and lived alongside the gypsies, where he famously recorded, in oil paintings and drawings, the last days of the community in Shave Green, a body of work which was exhibited in 2003 at St. Barbe Museum & Gallery in Lymington and at the retrospective of his work, Out of the Shadows at Penlee House, Penzance in 2012. Once settled in Home Farm in Emery Down in 1958, he was able to work from a studio and workshop, while Juanita, an accomplished horsewoman, set up a stud farm. He completed his 7.5 ton Carrara marble bas-relief The White Buck in 1958; this was saved from demolition in 2015. Berlin was able to paint, carve, cast bronze in his own foundry and write, exhibiting at shows including in London at Arthur Tooth and Son, and appearing on television and in newspapers. I Am Lazarus (1961), based on his war experiences, and The Dark Monarch (1962) were published. On the latter's publication, four St. Ives residents portrayed in it (none of them artists, although they included the poet and writer Arthur Caddick) began actions for libel.Anon., \\"Introduction to 'Sven Berlin: Sculpture' Exhibition Catalogue\\", Belgrave St Ives Gallery, no date (accessed 27 January 2012) Berlin was also fascinated by the Romany culture and wildlife of the New Forest, realised in a series of mystical and philosophical stories Jonah's Dream: A Meditation on Fishing and the story of his journey from St. Ives to the New Forest in a gypsy wagon, Dromengro, Man of the Road.Anselm Kuhn, \\"Sven Berlin\\" at artcornwall.org, no date (accessed 27 January 2012) His marriage to Juanita, a talented writer, poet and artist in her own right, ended in divorce, after she eloped with Fergus Casey, their groom. Later life Berlin met his third wife, Julia, 33 years his junior, and moved to the Isle of Wight in 1970, before finally settling near Wimborne in 1975.

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Iagorashvili retired from his sport, and emigrated to the United States to work as a physical education instructor at the Austin Community College in Austin, Texas. Iagorashvili eventually came out of retirement in 1995, and qualify for the men's modern pentathlon at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, representing his birth nation Georgia. Vaho gained his U.S. citizenship in 2002 making him eligible to compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Between 1999 and 2004, Iagorashvili was appointed to be the coach of the U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team. Iagorashvili finally represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, after receiving an automatic qualifying place from the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, where he won the gold medal. At the Olympics, he bettered his performance in the men's modern pentathlon event, finishing only in ninth place with a score of 5,276 points. Iagorashvili received a master's degree in physical education from Georgia Institute of Physical Cultures and Sport in Tbilisi, in 1985. Iagorashvili is currently coaching both men's and women's fencing teams at Penn State University in University Park, Pennsylvania. He is married to American modern pentathlete, Mary Beth Iagorashvili.

Located in Hampshire, England, it was founded in 1962 and remains an independent company.History of Wickham Labs. http://wickhamlabs.co.uk/history/ History The company was founded by veterinarian, William B. Cartmell, who established a veterinary practice at Wickham, Fareham, Hampshire in 1954. As the business grew, he developed facilities and animal care techniques, including the construction of an animal hospital along with founding another six branches, then an animal hospital. A laboratory facility was developed in order to improve treatment to animals. In 1962, Wickham Laboratories Ltd was incorporated as a separate company to provide contract testing services on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, doctors, farmers, and animal-feed manufacturers which included microbiology and chemistry testing. Mr Cartmell remains the company's Managing Director. Wickham Laboratories Ltd relocated to its current site at Hoeford Point in Gosport, in 2012. Shortly after the move, in 2015, Wickham Laboratories Ltd appointed a new CEO, Dr John McKenzie, The company currently employs around 130 staff. The facility is subject to regular compliance auditing by relevant regulatory authorities including the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Controversy 2003 Animal Burglary Keith Mann and one other activist from the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) broke into Wickham Laboratories on December 13, 2003, and stole 695 mice that were being used to test Dysport, made from botulinum toxin. This medicine is licensed in the UK to treat serious illnesses such as cerebral palsy.

He argued in court that the tests carried out by Wickham Laboratories were illegal because the product was being tested for cosmetic purposes, which is banned in Britain. The court rejected his defence, and found that the tests complied with British regulations because Dysport that was being tested is used for therapeutic purposes only. Mann initially received a verdict of 230 hours of community service with no jail time, but as he left the dock, proceeded to make threatening comments to Wickham Laboratories Ltd’s technical director at the time, Chris Bishop, and was immediately thereafter found in contempt of court and sentenced to 6 months in jail., \\"Animal rights activist jailed after threatening scientist\\".

On the right Adriaentgen Jans van Molenaarsgraaf is being strangled at the stake (strangulation before being burned was considered a more lenient punishment, and this was done to her because she was a woman). Engraving by Jan Luyken from the 1685 Martyrs Mirror. Jan Woutersz van Cuyck (or Kuik) (ca. 1540–1572) was a Dutch Renaissance painter from Dordrecht. He became famous as a Mennonite martyr of the Protestant Reformation who was executed in 1572. His heart-rending letters from prison were published in the Martyrs Mirror. Biography According to Houbraken he was imprisoned for his Mennonite beliefs. During his short imprisonment, he was persuaded to paint the local sheriff in the role of Solomon in an allegorical painting for the vierschaar in the city hall of Dordrecht. This painting and the story of its creation was a Dordrecht public attraction in 1712, when Houbraken was writing. Jan van Kuik Woutersze biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Though he was the painter of the piece, this story was proved wrong a century later when archival evidence showed that the painting had already been paid for two decades earlier in 1552. It remains highly ironic however, to think that he was tried for religious crimes in the same room for which he created the main decoration. Cuyck was burned together with another Mennonite martyr, Adriaentgen Jans van Molenaarsgraaf. He left a wife, a daughter of 7 years, and \\"a great rumour\\". His story and letters he wrote in prison were published in the Martyrs Mirror, also known as 't Bloedig Tooneel der Doopsgezinden, by Tieleman Jansz van Bracht.

Originally built as a storehouse for the burgeoning riverboat trade in the community of Blair's Ferry in the 1830s, the structure was eventually renovated and used for a variety of functions throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The building is one of the region's earliest surviving examples of a structure designed specifically as a warehouse.Joseph Herndon, Historic American Buildings Survey - Blair's Ferry Storehouse (HABS No. TN-41), 1974, pp. 1-6. Library of Congress Digital Collections. Retrieved: 30 October 2009. In 1977, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Location The Blair's Ferry Storehouse is located at the corner of Main Street and Church Street, just off U.S. Route 11 in downtown Loudon. The storehouse overlooks the west bank of the Tennessee River, at River Mile 592, with a large factory dominating the view on the opposite side of the river. The storehouse is visible from the Veterans Memorial Bridge, which crosses the river immediately downstream. Blair's Ferry Storehouse should not be confused with the Orme Wilson Storehouse, a mid-19th century structure currently occupied by the Wharf Street Coffeehouse. History 1839 map of what is now Loudon County, showing the location of Blair's Ferry The Blair family was one of the first families to settle at what is now Loudon, arriving sometime in the 1790s. James Blair (1777-1826)-- whose brother-in-law John Hudson Carmichael had established the Carmichael Inn in 1810-- was granted permission to operate a ferry along the river in 1817.Historic Loudon -- Timeline. Retrieved: 30 October 2009. The small community that grew up around the ferry thus became known as \\"Blair's Ferry.\\" The community grew slowly, for while it was in a location well-suited for river traffic, most river trade was local, since various river obstacles (such as Muscle Shoals) isolated the Upper Tennessee River from the great ports along the Mississippi River for all but a few months each year. In 1830, the state government funded dredging projects that made the river navigable from Knoxville to Decatur, Alabama (at the head of Muscle Shoals), bringing increased river traffic to Blair's Ferry.John Benhart, Appalachian Aspirations: The Geography of Urbanization and Development in the Upper Tennessee River Valley, 1865-1900 (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2007), pp. 23-25. Fireplace inside the Blair's Ferry Storehouse Throughout the 1820s and early 1830s, Blair's Ferry was the subject of a lengthy court case. In 1819, taking advantage of a provision in the Calhoun Treaty, the Cherokee leader Pathkiller claimed a reservation of land that included Blair's Ferry. Blair sued Pathkiller to regain title to the land. Although Blair died in 1826 and Pathkiller died the following year, Blair's sons John and Wiley continued to pursue the case against the Gardenhire family, to whom Pathkiller had sold the reservation. In 1834, the court ruled that Pathkiller's sale of the land had made his reservation claim null and void, and title to the land was returned to the Blairs. The Blair's Ferry Storehouse was constructed shortly after this legal victory to take advantage of the growing river trade. The storehouse's builder is unknown, but some sources suggest a local entrepreneur named James H. Johnston (an associate of the Blairs), who operated a general store at the storehouse until the 1860s. In the 1840s, Blair's Ferry had a general store, steamboat landing, and several houses, along with the ferry. The community changed its name to \\"Blairsville\\" in 1851, and the following year, the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad constructed a line connecting Blairsville with Dalton, Georgia. The company intended to connect Dalton with Knoxville, but struggled to raise funding to build a bridge across the Tennessee River, and thus Blairsville became the railroad's temporary northern terminus. With the help of railroad planners, Blairsville expanded, and was renamed \\"Loudon\\" after the nearby colonial Fort Loudoun. In the years 1852 to 1855 (when the bridge was completed), Loudon experienced a boom period, with farmers arriving from around the region to ship their crops to the south. After the U.S. Civil War, the Blair's Ferry Storehouse came into the possession of a local merchant named John West, who continued to use it as a general store. After West's death in 1883, the storehouse changed hands several times over subsequent decades. It was variously used as a dance hall, packing house, and as a temporary church. In the early 1900s, the second story was partitioned and modified for use as residential apartments. A grocer named W.B. Arp purchased the storehouse in the 1930s, and while he used the storehouse for a grocery store, he continued renting out the second story as a residence. Arp added the rear and side porches, and converted the basement into a residential apartment. A grocery store operated out of the first floor of the storehouse until the 1980s. Design Rear view, showing 20th-century porch additions The Blair's Ferry Storehouse is a Federal-style two-story building with a stepped brick facade and gable roof. The building was originally rectangular, measuring by (including the porch in the back), although a wing addition to the south wall in the 1930s gave the building an \\"L\\" shape. The bricks of the original structure are handmade bricks laid in common bond, while the bricks of the later additions are pressed bricks. The floors of the first and second stories consist of wooden planks, while the basement floor is poured concrete. The building has two porches-- a two-story, shed-roofed porch along the rear (west) wall, and a similar two-story porch along the south wall.Michael Tomlan, Historic American Buildings Survey - Blair's Ferry Storehouse (HABS No. TN-41), 1974, pp. 6-11. Library of Congress Digital Collections. Retrieved: 30 October 2009. The first floor of the interior contains a storeroom (at the east, or front end), a parlor, and a kitchen. The second story contains two bedrooms, a parlor, and a dining room. The basement contains an apartment similar to the one on the second story. There are no interior stairways, so the second story is accessible only via the side and rear porches, and the basement is accessible through a door adjacent to the rear porch.

The French were pursued by Wellington and his British-Portuguese army but the Allied advance was energetically contested by Ney's efforts, preventing Wellington from crushing Masséna's army when it was critically vulnerable. At the Battle of Pombal, Ney turned to face the larger Anglo-Portuguese forces and defeated their attack.  Background  Unable to break the Lines of Torres Vedras, Ney was given charge of the rear-guard while the main body of the French army withdrew from Portugal. The rear-guard consisted of Mermet's and Marchand's divisions. From the very beginning, Marshal Ney deceived the 'Iron Duke' (Wellington), manoeuvring his troops so that Wellington believed that the French were about to return to Torres Vedras, and thus he suspended an offensive operation for several hours, giving Masséna a huge running start. When it became clear to Wellington that he had been deceived, the British- Portuguese left Torres Vedras and began a pursuit. The British-Portuguese caught up with Ney at the town of Pombal.  Battle  A British advanced- guard much larger than that of the French, the latter consisting of only two battalions of the 6th Light Infantry, attacked the town of Pombal. The two French battalions were overwhelmed by numbers and, after a bitter struggle, the French were forced out of Pombal. It was then that Ney rushed in and spoke to the 6th Light Infantry. \\"Chasseurs,\\" he said, \\"you are losing your beautiful reputation, and you will dishonour yourselves forever if you do not drive the enemy out of Pombal. Come on! Those who are brave, with me!\\" With these words he galloped towards Pombal and the sixteenth Chasseurs charged with great enthusiasm. The Anglo-Portuguese was driven out, all the way to the Arunca River where several allied soldiers drowned.  Aftermath  Despite his success, Ney promptly set fire to the town of Pombal and continued his retreat on the right bank of the Arunca. The next action would be the Battle of Redinha. British general Sir Thomas Picton was impressed by Ney’s actions, as the former was able to observe the latter’s deceiving movements, claiming that it was a \\"perfect lesson in the art of war\\".

It was the largest firm of engine makers in Oldham, Lancashire, England. The company produced large steam-driven engines for textile mills in Oldham and exported to India, Holland and Brazil. History Buckley & Taylor started business in 1861, and were producing mill engines by 1867. Many of their early engines were large compound beam engines. By 1870 they had established a reputation for horizontal twin tandem compounds. Their original site at the Castle Ironworks at Green acres expanded to in 1880, and they operated a forge at Openshaw. In 1890 they were employing 400 men. They built their last engine in 1926. Through Buckley, the firm had a close relationship with the Oldham Boiler Works Ltd. Samuel Buckley was born in 1837 at Hey, Lees, to a mule spinner. He started work in a mill at the age of six. While working he got an education and studied engineering. Before he was twenty he had been appointed chief engineer at Castle Mill and Lowerhouse Mill. He had an interest in politics and was Mayor of Oldham on three occasions: 1883/4 1889/90 and 1890/1. James Taylor was born in 1838 at Shaw, and served an apprenticeship with Woolstenhulmes & Rye. Both men were engineers, though it was Taylor who dealt with the practical details, and Buckley conducted the commercial side of the business. On Taylor's death, Buckley managed the business alone. It was incorporated in 1902; and Taylor's son William took control. It was taken over by the Brightside Foundry, general engineers of Sheffield in 1947, but continued to operate under its own name.  Horizontal twin tandem  These were 'standard' mill engines preferred by the Oldham Limiteds. An early example was the 1,000-ihp engine delivered to the North Moor spinning company in 1876. The design was conservative, using slide valves and spur wheel gear drive transmission. They did start to fit Corliss valves and rope drives in 1883, but these didn't become standard until the 1890s. An example of such an engine was the 2,000-ihp, horizontal twin tandem triple expansion delivered to Pearl Mill in 1892. Beam Engines During the 1890s Buckley & Taylor revived the beam engine, building at least 11 engines using designs of JH Tattersall, a consulting engineer from Preston. The two identical engines, twin beam triple expansion engines, built for Nile Mill and Tay Mill were the biggest ever beam engine installed in a cotton mill. They delivered 2,500 ihp and cost over £10,000  Marine type mill engines  Inverted vertical engines, known commonly as marine type engines, needed less space to operate. From about 1899 Buckley & Taylor started to specialise in this type of engine. Starting with an engine for Don Mill, Middleton, they built 29 of these engines from 1899 to 1916 with a total capacity of 33,000 ihp. They provided a marine type vertical triple expansion engines to Regent Mill, Failsworth, in 1906. It was the largest they built; with 1,800 installed horsepower. The engine had a low-pressure cylinder. It was sometimes loaded to 2,000 ihp. It ran until 1958, when it was scrapped. It ran 60,000 spindles. There was a flywheel, 26 ropes operated at 64 rpm. Mills driven by their engines Between 1861 and 1926 Buckley & Taylor built more than 200 mill engines with a total capacity of over 160,000 ihp. Arthur Roberts details 26 in his black book.

He is a fictional Vietnam veteran, soldier and bounty hunter, and is used to make parody of racism, violence, nationalism, sexism, which are included as exaggerated character traits. His comic strips were collected in 10 books, and in a complete Todo Boogie (\\"All Boogie\\"). An animated movie of the character was made in 2009. Publication history Boogie was created by Roberto Fontanarrosa in the 1970s, as a comedic parody of Dirty Harry. The original style was similar to that of Hugo Pratt, but slowly evolved into a style of its own. Fontanarrosa created the character in 1972, as an inside joke with the comic book artist \\"Crist\\". Crist showed it to Alberto Cognini, head of the \\"Hortensia\\" magazine from Cordoba, who published it. Fontanarrosa found a direction for his artistic career in making parodies of stereotyped stock characters. Of all those, he decided to keep working on Boogie and Inodoro Pereyra (a parody of a gaucho). The first compilation of his comic strips was published in 1974, and in the 1980s was included in the magazines Humor, Superhumor and Fierro, published by Ediciones de la Urraca. The character ceased publication in the 1990s, following the general decline in the use of killer characters. The strips were published abroad as well, in 1975 was published in a book in Italy, renamed as \\"Bogart\\". Brazil renamed him as Boogie, o Seboso and Italy renamed him later as Boogie, l'Oleoso.

He is from Ugili-Amai in Ndokwa-west L.G.A of Delta State Nigeria. Osakwe obtained a B.Sc, M.Sc, LLB and BL from University of Benin. Senate career Delta State in Nigeria Osakwe was elected to the Senate for the Delta North constituency in 1999. In October 2002, when there was a plan to impeach President Olusegun Obasanjo, he said that senators should not sign the impeachment document without first consulting their electorates. Shortly before the April 2003 elections, Osakwe denied being among the senators who endorsed the amendment of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) Act. He was reelected in 2003 as candidate for the People's Democratic Party (PDP), despite a poor reputation for contributing to debates or motions in the upper chamber. He was elected again in 2007 representing the Accord party. He was appointed to committees on Gas, Banking, Insurance & Other Financial Institutions, Appropriation, Niger Delta and Senate Services. In a January 2008 debate over the proposed Freedom of Information Bill, Osakwe asked why the bill was not signed by former President Olusegun Obasanjo. He noted that the act had to comply with the Official Secrets Act. In May 2008, the Election Petition Tribunal in Asaba struck out a petition against the election of the Governor of Delta State, Emmanuel Uduaghan and Patrick Osakwe. The PDP candidate Mirian Comfort Ali had asserted that the Accord party did not validly present Patrick Osakwe as candidate for the election.

Blanquist Candide Candide was a newspaper founded by Gustave Tridon and Auguste Blanqui on 3 May 1865. It appeared on Wednesday and Saturday every week, and cost 5 centimes. The main collaborators on Candide were Blanqui, Tridon Villeneuve, Vaissier, Watteau, Marchand, Viette, Verlière and Sumino. Maurrassist Candide The name was taken up in 1924 by a weekly newspaper launched by the bookseller Arthème Fayard. This paper was one of the main literary and political weeklies of the inter-war period, and its formula inspired other papers from Gringoire on the extreme-right to Vendredi and Marianne on the left. As for itself, Candide was rooted in the Maurrassist movement, nationalist and antisemitic: Pierre Gaxotte, personal secretary of Charles Maurras, was a member of the collective editorial leadership until 1940; Lucien Dubech as drama critic, Dominique Sordet as music critic, Maurice Pefferkorn for sports and Abel Manouvriez the legal columnist performed the same roles for both Candide and L'Action française; Lucien Rebatet and Robert Brasillach, two young Maurrassian talents, wrote for Candide. Its numerous cartoons, particularly those of Sennep, were much appreciated by the readership. Candide was anti-parliamentarian, anti-republican, keenly anti- communist, basically, antidemocratic, and it was not loath to antisemitic tones. After 6 February 1934 it became radicalised along with the rest of the extreme-right and a good part of the right, while not reaching the robust fascism of Je suis partout and while retaining a light tone. Hostility towards Jews and foreigners was reasserted. While it was often watchful of the danger from Germany, Candide approved of the Munich Agreement, following the general evolution of the Maurrassist movement. Printed in large format (43x60 cm), the paper ran 80,000 copies in its first year, almost 150,000 in 1930, then at least 340,000 from 1936 onwards (465,000 in that year according to Pierre Albert, emeritus professor at Panthéon-Assas University). It exercised an important influence in politics in conservative and reactionary circles, and its literary pages was respected more widely: Albert Thibaudet, who had nothing in common with the extreme-right, wrote for Candide (although he died in 1936). Mainly from 1936 onwards, Candide tried to convince its readers of the imminence of a communist coup d'état in France. Under the German occupation, Candide left Paris for the zone libre and supported the Révolution nationale, which embodied substantially its political ideas, particularly from 1934–1936; however it avoided the Parisian collaborationism defended by Je suis partout. It disappeared after the liberation, banned for its compromising attitude towards the Vichy regime. Other contributors included Georges Blond and Irène Némirovsky. Gaullist Candide A weekly called Le Nouveau Candide which counted Jean Dutourd, Paul Gordeaux and Gilles Perrault among its columnists as well as Jean-François Steiner who would become the chair of Maurice Papon's defense committee, appeared during the course of the 1960s. According to the revelations of Constantin Melnik, special adviser for prime minister Michel Debré, this weekly received secret funding in order to counter the influence of papers opposed to the Algerian war, such as L'Express and France-Observateur.

Ramot Polin (, lit. Poland Heights) is part of the larger neighborhood of Ramot, an Israeli settlement in northwest East Jerusalem. It was constructed by the Kollel Polen (Poland) in stages beginning in 1972, under the auspices of the Office for Building and Habitation, and is populated, as intended, mostly by Haredi Jewish families, including Breslov.Jerusalem, The Breslov Directory The neighborhood contains 720 housing units of varying sizes. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Planning and building The background to building this neighborhood, as well as several other neighborhoods in Jerusalem - including additional sub-neighborhoods in Ramot and in Gilo, was to settle wide parts of Jerusalem through new building after the 1967 Six-Day War. This phenomenon was characterized by urban and architectural trials by many Israeli architects, building designers, and engineers to design new shapes of residential, community, and local structures. In charge of planning the project of Ramot Polin, which is one of those settling projects, was the Israeli architect Zvi Hecker for both the neighborhood and the architectural planning. Hecker, who is known as an experienced architect with unique, innovative geometrical shapes, included in his plan several architectural proposals that were very innovative at the time.

The summit is the site of the Jakobsberg Telecommunication Tower, which stands on the site of a former Bismarck Tower, near the Bismarckburg Inn, the Schlageter Monument and the Porta Bluff. Its name has been commonly used since 1788, when a Prussian publican (Zöllner), by the name of Jakob, cultivated a vineyard on its southern slopes.  Geography  Kaiser Wilhelm Monument with the Jakobsberg The Jakobsberg rises at the western end of the Wesergebirge hills in the district of Minden-Lübbecke directly northwest of the town of Porta Westfalica and about 6 km south of the town of Minden which lies beside the Minden Aqueduct. It is located due east of the gorge of Porta Westfalica, which is on the northern perimeter of the Weser Uplands and southern boundary of the North German Plain, and through which the River Weser flows from the hill country northwards into the plain. The hill on the opposite side of the gorge to the west, the Wittekindsberg (294.2 m), which is the eastern guardian of the Wiehen Hills, defines the western side of this gorge. The Jakobsberg is surrounded by the extreme eastern parts of the North Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park that runs from just in front of the Bückeburg into the Wiehen Hills.  Bismarck Tower, Porta Westfalica  The old Bismarck Tower (1952 to 1974) In 1902 a Bismarck Tower was built on the highest point of the Jakobsberg (235.2 m) im memory of the old imperial Reich Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898), by his admirers. The tower consisted of sandstone blocks, was 22 m high and was looked after by the Bismarck Federation (Bismarkbund). On its 50th anniversary (1952) it was torn down in order to make way for the first transmission tower on the Jakobsberg. The sandstone blocks of the Bismarck Tower were used to rebuild the town hall in Minden that had been destroyed in the Second World War.  Underground manufacturing facility  In the closing phase of the Second World War, most likely in March 1944, the manufacture of pipes by the firm of Philips was moved from the Netherlands to the Jakobsberg. Disused galleries of an old iron ore mine were developed. Such galleries run through many parts of the Wiehen Hills and Wesergebirge, their entrances are usually walled up nowadays and made unrecognisable. In Hausberge and Barkhausen there was a satellite of Neuengamme concentration camp with over a thousand prisoners,International Tracing Service HQ. Catalogue of Camps and Prisons in Germany and German- occupied Territories. Arolsen, April 1950 of which a considerable number worked in the Jakobsberg. Women from the area also worked, under much better conditions, in the hill.A Polish prisoner has described work in the Jakobsberg in detail: Wieslaw Kielar: Anus Mundi. Krakow 1972. His arrival from Auschwitz into Porta Westfalica is in Chapter XCVII. After the end of the war the local population used their surviving knowledge of the mine system running through the hills to collect material from the production facilities and sell it on the black market.This information comes from local eye witness accounts. The British occupation forces brought this to an end with a demolition that caused pictures to fall from the walls up to a distance of 15 kilometres away and that created part of the present-day riverside front of the Jakobsberg.  Transmission towers  The Jakobsberg tower seen from Hausberge  Old transmission tower  On the site of the former observation tower, the Bismarckturm Porta Westfalica, a steel and concrete transmission tower was built in 1952. It was also called the Bismarck Tower. The Deutsche Bundespost, who had bought the land needed for the tower from the Bismarck Federation, was contractually committed as the owner of the transmission tower to establish a Bismarck memorial on the new tower and a public viewing platform.  New transmission tower  The Jakobsberg Telecommunication Tower (known locally as Langer Jakob or \\"Long James\\") was built on the site of the old Bismarck Tower from 1974 to 1978, also in concrete and steel. It is a 142 m high transmission tower (standard tower). The Deutsche Bundespost, as owners of the tower, was once again contractually obliged to have a Bismarck memorial and an observation platform on the new tower. Today the tower is owned by Deutsche Telekom. The Jakobsberg Telecommunication Tower has an operations room at a height of 50 m and an observation platform open to the public at a height of 23.26 m, from which a good all-round view may be enjoyed, for example over parts of the Weser Uplands and the North German Plain as well as the Kaiser Wilhelm Monument on the Wittekindsberg.  Bismarckburg Inn  Bismarckburg Inn A few metres west of the Jakobsberg transmission tower is Gaststätte Bismarckburg, an inn that was built at the end of the 18th century and is rich in tradition. It acted as a falconry as well as being a popular local destination. It adapted to changing circumstances over time by undergoing several conversions; but has since become empty and fallen into disrepair. Schlageter Monument  Schlageter Monument  On the crest of the Jakobsberg towards the southwest and just under 650 m (as the crow flies) west of the Bismarckburg Inn at a height of are the ruins of the Schlageter Monument. Built in 1933/34, it was never completed, probably for ideological reasons. On a plinth was a large cross. This only stood there for a short time before being moved to Minden's North Cemetery (Nordfriedhof). There it was integrated into a memorial for those who fell in the First World War. In 1958 the authorities of the town of Porta Westfalica had the ruins of the monument made accessible and erected an observation platform on the plinth, that gives visitors a far-reaching view to the south and west, for example to the Kaiser Wilhelm Monument on the Wittekindsberg. View from the Porta Bluff  Porta Bluff  About 150 m northwest of the Schlageter Monument on the western slopes of the Jakobsberg above a steep, southwest dipping crag is the Porta Bluff (Porta Kanzel, ), a natural observation platform. In 1887 the crag, as the Porta Bluff, was made accessible by members of the Hausberge Tourism Club. From there it offers a good view of the Kaiser Wilhelm Monument on the Wittekindsberg and over the River Weser in the Porta Westfalica gorge.  Military training area  On the northern parts of the Jakobsberg (around the village of Lerbeck) is the Minden-Bückeburg training area, a military training area for the German Armed Forces, the Bundeswehr.  Transport links  Near the Wittekindsberg the B 61, B 65 and B 482 federal roads cross one another. These provide links to the A 2 and A 30 motorways not far to the south as well as side roads that lead to the hill. In addition the Jakobsberg is linked to the Deutsche Bahn railway network by Porta station, which is part of Porta Westfalica and situated at the western foot of the hill on the east bank of the Weser. The Jakobsberg is covered by a good network of walking trails, including the European long-distance path E11 over which the points of interest on the hill may be reached. Access for private vehicles is the village of Hausberge.

At the age of fifteen he joined the army of the Habsburg Monarchy and later fought against Ottoman Turkey. During the French Revolutionary Wars he became a general officer and saw extensive service. He commanded a corps during the Napoleonic Wars. From 1801 until his death, he was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment. Prince Heinrich came to the attention of the Habsburg king in his thirties. After distinguishing himself in battle against the Turks, the emperor promoted him to command an infantry regiment. He served against the French First Republic in the Flanders Campaign and was promoted to the rank of general. The year 1796 found him leading Austrian troops against the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. In the following year he commanded a division. In 1799 Prince Heinrich fought against France in Germany and Switzerland. He led a division in northern Italy during the War of the Third Coalition. In the Danube campaign of 1809, he started out leading a division and ended the war in command of a corps. In 1813, he led a successful diplomatic effort to cause the Kingdom of Bavaria to change sides and join the Allies against Napoleon. Into his seventies he served Austria in various military and civil positions. Early career Heinrich XV was born into the House of Reuss at Greiz Castle on 22 February 1751. His parents Graf (later Prince) Heinrich XI Reuss von Ober-Greiz (1722–1800) and Grafin Konradine Reuss zu Köstritz (1719–1770) carried on the family tradition of naming all their male children Heinrich and numbering them consecutively. They duly named their six sons Heinrich XII through Heinrich XVII, while their five daughters were christened Amalie, Frederike, Isabella, Marie, and Ernestine. Belonging to the Reuss Elder Line, Heinrich XV was entitled to be called Prince (Fürst), but he was not the reigning prince. That dignity was held by his surviving elder brother Heinrich XIII from 1800 to 1817. Heinrich XV enlisted in the Austrian Macquire Infantry Regiment # 35 in 1766. He, his father, and brothers became princes in 1778. When Maria Theresa died in 1780, and Joseph II of Austria became emperor in fact as well as name, Joseph favored the young prince, promoting him to Major in 1784. During the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91), the emperor appointed Reuss to his staff. For notable service at the storming of Šabac in 1788, the emperor promoted the prince to Oberst (Colonel) of the Wenzel Colloredo Infantry Regiment # 56. Reuss fought at the Siege of Belgrade in the fall of 1789. . French Revolutionary Wars War of the First Coalition In the spring of 1793, Prince Heinrich successfully defended a position against the French and received promotion to General-Major in May. He served on the staff of Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and was present at the Battle of Avesnes-le-Sec on 12 September. In this action, Prince Johann of Liechtenstein and 2,000 cavalry crushed a force of 7,000 French troops, inflicting 2,000 casualties and capturing 2,000 more.Smith 1998, pp. 54–55. At the beginning of 1796, Reuss commanded an infantry brigade on the upper Rhine. Siege of Mantua Campaign Map 1796–1797 Bonaparte's victories over Johann Peter Beaulieu in April and May 1796 altered the strategic situation. When the Austrian high command transferred Dagobert von Wurmser from Germany to Italy, Reuss and heavy reinforcements went with him. During the first relief of the Siege of Mantua, the 45-year-old prince led a brigade in Peter Quasdanovich's column on the west side of Lake Garda.. At first, operations went well for the Austrians, but Bonaparte defeated Quasdanovich in the complex Battle of Lonato and forced him to retreat to Riva del Garda. At the height of the battle, on 3 August, Reuss seized Desenzano del Garda, rescuing some recently captured soldiers belonging to Joseph Ocskay's command. However, the proximity of superior numbers of French troops soon compelled him to retreat to Gavardo.Boycott-Brown 2001, p. 394. During the second relief of Mantua, Heinrich led a 5,200-man brigade in Paul Davidovich's corps. His area of responsibility stretched from the northern tip of Lake Garda to Trento on the west side of the Adige river.Boycott-Brown 2001, p. 418. On 3 September a 10,000-man French division led by Claude Belgrand de Vaubois drove his outposts out of Nago–Torbole on the lake. An overconfident army command ordered him to attack the French the next day, but he admitted that this was not possible.Boycott-Brown 2001, p. 423. In the subsequent Battle of Rovereto on 4 September, he defended the camp of Mori on the west bank, while his colleagues Josef Vukassovich and Johann Sporck held Marco on the east bank. Bonaparte in greatly superior strength routed Davidovich's corps and drove them north of Trento.Boycott-Brown 2001, pp. 424–425. In the fourth relief of Mantua, the new army commander József Alvinczi assigned Reuss to command the largest column in his army, nearly 7,900 soldiers.Boycott-Brown 2001, p. 492. Reuss followed the west bank of the Adige, while Vukassovich's column marched on the east bank, and the rest of the army followed roads and trails farther west near Monte Baldo. During the Battle of Rivoli, the troops under Reuss bravely fought their way out of the river bottom to the plateau against tenacious resistance. At this moment, a desperate French counterattack panicked some Austrians from the other columns and drove them to seek refuge in the river valley. Disordered by fleeing troops and attacked from two sides by the French, Reuss' column retreated to the bottom of the gorge where their commander managed to rally them.Boycott-Brown 2001, p. 514. With Reuss checked, Bonaparte defeated the remaining Austrians on the plateau and won the battle. Heinrich was promoted to Feldmarschal-Leutnant on 1 March 1797. During the withdrawal from Italy that month, Reuss led a division in the left wing under Archduke Charles, retreating to Ljubljana (Laibach). War of the Second Coalition On 25 and 26 March 1799, Heinrich fought under Archduke Charles at the Battle of Stockach and the Battle of Winterthur in May. He led a division of Archduke Charles' Center at the First Battle of Zurich in June. His immediate commander, Olivier, Count of Wallis received a mortal wound during the engagement.Smith 1998, p. 158. Between March and September 1800 he defended the Vorarlberg and the Tyrol. Emperor Francis II named him Proprietor (Inhaber) of Reuss-Plauen Infantry Regiment # 17 in 1801. He remained the proprietor until his death. His brother Heinrich XIII was proprietor of Reuss- Greiz Infantry Regiment # 55 from 1803 to 1809, and Reuss-Greiz Infantry Regiment # 18 from 1809 to 1817.Pivka 1979, pp. 82–84. Napoleonic Wars Heinrich served under Archduke Charles in Italy during the War of the Third Coalition. The original organization of the Armee von Italien called for Reuss to command an eight-battalion division.Schneid 2002, p. 165. But at the Battle of Caldiero on 29–31 October 1805, Charles gave him command of the left wing. Reuss played a prominent role in the fighting, commanding Johann Kalnássy's brigade of eight line infantry battalions, Heironymus Colloredo-Mansfeld's brigade of five grenadier battalions, and the Archduke Charles Uhlan Regiment # 3.Schneid 2002, p. 170. The fog lifted around 11 am on 30 October and Reuss' troops were immediately assaulted by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme's division. Caldiero village, held by his troops, changed hands several times during the day, as Duhesme attacked and Reuss counterattacked.Schneid 2002, pp. 35–36. The day ended with Caldiero in French hands, but the Austrian line intact. On 31 October, Reuss repelled a French probe of the Austrian left flank.Schneid 2002, pp. 39–40. The next day, Charles withdrew to the east and no more major actions occurred in the campaign.Rothenberg 1982, p. 99. Reuss led a division at the Battle of Landshut The War of the Fifth Coalition found Heinrich leading a division in the V Armeekorps under Archduke Louis of Austria. He commanded 12 battalions in the brigades of Federico Bianchi and Franz Schulz von Rothacker.Bowden & Tarbox 1980, p. 69. In the campaign culminating in the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April, he fought at the battles of Abensberg and Landshut. He led an attacking column in a successful action at Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 24 April.Smith 1998, p. 293–294. He participated in the Battle of Ebersberg on 3 May.Smith 1998, p. 298. On 15 May, Heinrich received promotion to Feldzeugmeister and was appointed to command V Armeekorps. He missed the Battle of Aspern-Essling because his troops were detailed to watch the Nussdorf sector.Rothenberg 1982, p. 149. By the orders of Archduke Charles, his small corps also sat out the Battle of Wagram. Instead, they guarded the Danube river crossings to the west of the battlefield.Bowden & Tarbox 1980, p. 130. His 8,958 troops included the brigades of Johann Neustädter, Philipp Pfluger, and Johann Klebelsberg.Bowden & Tarbox 1980, pp. 165–168. On 10 July, Reuss held off the pursuing French army in a successful rearguard action at Schöngrabern. The following day, his corps participated in a much larger action at Znaim, where each side lost about 6,000 casualties.Smith 1998, p. 323–324. In the early hours of 12 July, both sides agreed to a cease fire.Chandler 1996, p. 730. For the actions of 10–11 July, Heinrich received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. In 1813, he commanded the Army of the Danube, a corps of observation on the Bavarian frontier. On 8 October, he signed the Treaty of Ried with Karl Philipp von Wrede, which resulted in the Kingdom of Bavaria switching sides and joining the allies against Napoleon. This act earned him the Order of Leopold from Austria and the Military Order of Max Joseph from Bavaria. Russia honored him with the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. He was Governor of the Duchy of Milan and Viceroy of Lombardy–Venetia in 1814–15, earning the Gold Medal for civilian service and the Order of the Iron Crown. Later he served as Governor of Galicia. He was promoted Feldmarschall when he retired from the army on 10 September 1824. He died on 30 August 1825 at Greiz Castle, having never married.

Founded in Zikhron Ya'akov in 1949, it relocated to Kfar Hasidim, adjacent to Rekhasim, in 1955, where it operates today with nearly 200 students and a kollel. Early history Knesses Chizkiyahu was founded by Rabbi Noah Shimonowitz, one of the greatest students of Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz, who decided to open a yeshiva after surviving the Holocaust. He visited the Chazon Ish for his blessing and advice, and was told to seek a suitable location in the north of Israel, which at the time did not host any Torah institutions. Together with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Dovid Mishkovsky, Rabbi Shimonowitz established the yeshiva in the central synagogue of Zikhron Ya'akov and named it after Mishkovsky's father, Rabbi Chizkiyahu Yosef Mishkovsky, former Rav of Krinik, Poland. The initial enrollment of three students expanded to thirty students by the end of the first year. In 1952, Rabbi Elyah Lopian, the contemporary leader of the Mussar movement, joined the staff as Mashgiach Ruchani, together with his son-in-law, Rabbi Kalman Pinsky. Lopian's influence on the yeshiva was so pronounced that it continues to this day. As an example of one tradition which he instituted, any yeshiva student who fills a cup to wash his hands must refill it for the next user in line. Move to Kfar Hasidim The yeshiva experienced much difficulty in its early years, as students lacked sleeping facilities and organized meals due to the country's difficult economic situation. The location of the yeshiva in the central synagogue also caused friction between the students and local residents coming to pray. The yeshiva administration decided to find a new building, and then to leave Zikhron Ya'akov altogether. When the news spread that the yeshiva was seeking a new home, many Orthodox Jewish communities extended a hand of welcome, but none were located in the north where the Chazon Ish had desired a yeshiva to be founded. Finally, a group of activists from the northern village of Kfar Hasidim petitioned the yeshiva and were accepted. With the blessing of the Chazon Ish, the yeshiva purchased a lot on the outskirts of the village and five buildings containing a beth midrash, dining hall, dormitories and offices. The yeshiva moved into its new home at the end of April 1955. Five days after the move, the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Shimonowitz, died of a stroke. Rabbi Lopian took charge and appointed Shimonowitz's brother-in-law, Rabbi Raphael Eliyahu Eliezer Mishkovsky, who was also the Rav of Kfar Hasidim, as the new rosh yeshiva.Marks, Yehudah. \\"The Torah Empire of the North\\", Hamodia Israel News, March 19, 2015, pp. 21-23. Mishkovsky worked together with Lopian to shape and guide the yeshiva and its students. In May 1964, they laid the cornerstone for a new building to house the many students who had outgrown the original site. This building is still in use today. Faculty Mishkovsky led the yeshiva until his death in 1981. He was succeeded as rosh yeshiva by his son-in-law, Rabbi Dovid Yitzchak Mann (1945–2012), who was succeeded upon his death by his eldest son, Rabbi Yehoshua Mann. The mashgiach ruchani, Rabbi Elyah Lopian, died in 1970; he was succeeded by his protégé, Rabbi Dov Yaffe, who served until his death in November 2017.

Colour commentary for Bell's television broadcasts is performed by Ray Ferraro, while play-by-play is provided by Chris Cuthbert and Gord Miller. Colour commentary for Rogers' television broadcasts is performed by Greg Millen, while play-by-play is provided by John Bartlett. MLSE also operates a regional specialty channel, the Leafs Nation Network. The Leafs Nation Network broadcasts programming related to the Maple Leafs, as well as games for the Toronto Marlies, the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League affiliate. Television On Saturday nights, the Toronto Maple Leafs have always been on CBC's Hockey Night in Canada. Bill Hewitt did the play-by-play on most, but not all games through 1980-81. Bob Cole did numerous Maple Leafs games starting in 1973-74, and most Maple Leafs games starting in 1981-82. Maple Leafs road games were televised on the Telemeter pay TV service for four years starting on February 28, 1960, when Bill Hewitt and Bob Wolff did the inaugural telecast from New York's Madison Square Garden. Until 1961, only Sunday games were shown and in 1961-62 and 1962-63, Bill Hewitt did play-by- play on all road games played in the United States. The Maple Leafs appeared on television on Wednesdays starting in 1960, first on CFTO, then on CTV and CHCH with Bill Hewitt on play-by-play. To be more specific, CFTO aired midweek Maple Leafs games starting from the station's inception in 1960 all the way to 1976-77. Then CHCH Hamilton broadcast them from 1977-78 to 1987-88. Then Global's CIII channel 41 had them until at least 1991-92. In 1981-82, following Bill Hewitt's sudden retirement, various combinations worked these games. Normally, either Mickey Redmond or Gary Dornhoefer served on colour commentary with play-by-play provided from Dave Hodge, Danny Gallivan, or Dan Kelly. Jim Hughson did play-by-play for the Wednesday games from 1982-86, the first three years with Gary Dornhoefer and the fourth with Brad Selwood. In 1986-87, Harry Neale became the mid-week analyst, and play-by-play was done by either Peter Maher, Bruce Buchanan or Erik Tomas. In 1988-89, Joe Bowen did play-by-play on midweek TV games thru 1994-95. From 1995–97, Jiggs McDonald did play-by-play before Bowen's return to TV the following season. When Bowen was doing TV, radio play-by-play was done by Ken Daniels thru 1994-95 and Dennis Beyak starting in 1997-98. *Foster Hewitt (Play-by-play: 1952–1958, Colour commentator: 1958–1961) *Bill Hewitt (Play-by-play: 1958–1981) *Brian McFarlane (Colour commentator, 1964–1980) *Bob Goldham (Colour commentator, 1961–1977) *Danny Gallivan (Play-by-play, 1981–1982) *Jim Hughson (Play-by- play, 1982–1986) *Bruce Buchanan (Play-by-play, 1986–1987) *Peter Maher (Play- by-play, 1986–1988 ) *Erik Tomas (Play-by-play, 1987–1988) *Harry Neale (Colour commentator, 1986–2007, 2013–2014) *Scotty Bowman (Colour commentator, 1987–1988) *Ken Daniels (Play-by-play, 1988–1991) *Jiggs McDonald (Play-by- play, 1995–1998) *Joe Bowen (Play-by-play, 1991–1995, 1998–2014) *Paul Romanuk (Play-by-play, 2014–2018) *Dave Randorf (Play-by-play, 2014–present) *Greg Millen (Colour commentator, 2007–present) *Gord Miller (Play-by-play, 2014–present) *Chris Cuthbert (Play-by-play, 2014–present) *Ray Ferraro (Colour commentator, 2014–present) *Jamie McLennan (Colour commentator, 2014–present) *John Bartlett (Play-by-play, 2018–present) Radio Like the Maple Leafs television broadcasts, radio broadcasts are split evenly between Rogers' CJCL (Sportsnet 590, The Fan) and Bell's CHUM (TSN Radio 1050).

Their Christmas single, \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\", reached the lower edges of the UK singles chart in 1983. Background Renaissance had been moderately successful during the 1970s, having a top ten UK singles chart hit in 1978 with \\"Northern Lights\\", but were better known as an album band, and for their live performances, particularly at Carnegie Hall. In 1979, the band had taken a less symphonic/orchestral and more electronically based turn with the album Azure d'Or, which resulted in disappointing sales and resultant dropping by their label, Warner Bros. Records. Meanwhile, the lineup of Renaissance was in flux, as John Tout and Terry Sullivan left for varying reasons. Nevada The reduced version of Renaissance then took stock; according to the sleeve notes to their CD, \\"It was time to stand back, take a breather, experiment, and to embark on a new working relationship with their fellow countryman Peter Gosling\\". Gosling had been in the 1960s band \\"Moon's Train\\" which had been managed and produced by Bill Wyman, played keyboards on the Renaissance album Camera Camera and later on Time-Line. The single \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\", a version of the Christmas carol by Gustav Holst and Christina Rossetti was released for the 1982 Christmas market, but did not enter the UK singles chart until 8 January 1983. It spent one week on the chart at number 71. Their second single, \\"You Know I Like It\\" did not trouble the charts and the project went no further. Renaissance finally folded in 1987; Haslam and Dunford embarked on solo careers, and Gosling wrote music for television and film.  Pictures in the Fire  This was a compilation CD of Nevada's material, released in 2000 by Mooncrest Records; as well as the four single tracks, it included six other songs, and five bonus tracks recorded by Renaissance. The versions of the tracks released as singles are different on this compilation, possibly due to licensing issues, and the recording quality varies greatly.

The WLF equation has the form : \\\\log(a_T) = \\\\frac{-C_1(T-T_\\\\mathrm{r})}{C_2 + (T-T_\\\\mathrm{r})} where \\\\log(a_T) is the decadic logarithm of the WLF shift factorHiemenz, Paul C., Lodge, Timothy P., Polymer Chemistry, 2e. 2007. §12.4.3, Page 484. , T is the temperature, Tr is a reference temperature chosen to construct the compliance master curve and C1, C2 are empirical constants adjusted to fit the values of the superposition parameter aT. The equation can be used to fit (regress) discrete values of the shift factor aT vs. temperature. Here, values of shift factor aT are obtained by horizontal shift log(aT) of creep compliance data plotted vs. time or frequency in double logarithmic scale so that a data set obtained experimentally at temperature T superposes with the data set at temperature Tr. A minimum of three values of aT are needed to obtain C1, C2, and typically more than three are used. Once constructed, the WLF equation allows for the estimation of the temperature shift factor for temperatures other than those for which the material was tested. In this way, the master curve can be applied to other temperatures. However, when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg), the WLF equation is applicable to temperatures at or above Tg only; the constants are positive and represent Arrhenius behavior. Extrapolation to temperatures below Tg is erroneous.J. Sullivan, Creep and physical aging of composites, Composites Science and Technology 39(3) (1990) 207-32. When the constants are obtained with data at temperatures below Tg, negative values of C1, C2 are obtained, which are not applicable above Tg and do not represent Arrhenius behavior. Therefore, the constants obtained above Tg are not useful for predicting the response of the polymer for structural applications, which necessarily must operate at temperatures below Tg. The WLF equation is a consequence of time–temperature superposition (TTSP), which mathematically is an application of Boltzmann's superposition principle. It is TTSP, not WLF, that allows the assembly of a compliance master curve that spans more time, or frequency, than afforded by the time available for experimentation or the frequency range of the instrumentation, such as dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). While the time span of a TTSP master curve is broad, according to Struik,L. C. E. Struik, Physical aging in amorphous polymers and other materials, Elsevier Scientific Pub. Co. ; New York, 1978. it is valid only if the data sets did not suffer from ageing effects during the test time. Even then, the master curve represents a hypothetical material that does not age. Effective Time Theory. needs to be used to obtain useful prediction for long term time.E. J. Barbero, Time–temperature–age superposition principle for predicting long-term response of linear viscoelastic materials, chapter 2 in Creep and fatigue in polymer matrix composites, R. M. Guedes, editor, Woodhead Pub. Co., UK, 2010. Having data above Tg, it is possible to predict the behavior (compliance, storage modulus, etc.) of viscoelastic materials for temperatures T>Tg, and/or for times/frequencies longer/slower than the time available for experimentation. With the master curve and associated WLF equation it is possible to predict the mechanical properties of the polymer out of time scale of the machine (typically 10^{-2} to 10^2 Hz), thus extrapolating the results of multi-frequency analysis to a broader range, out of measurement range of machine.  Predicting the Effect of Temperature on Viscosity by the WLF Equation  The Williams-Landel-Ferry model, or WLF for short, is usually used for polymer melts or other fluids that have a glass transition temperature. The model is: :\\\\mu(T)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\mu_0 10^ \\\\left( \\\\frac {-C_1 (T-T_r)} {C_2+ T -T_r} \\\\right) where T-temperature, C_1, C_2, T_r and \\\\mu_0 are empiric parameters (only three of them are independent from each other). If one selects the parameter T_r based on the glass transition temperature, then the parameters C_1, C_2 become very similar for the wide class of polymers. Typically, if T_r is set to match the glass transition temperature T_g, we get :C_1 \\\\approx17.44 and :C_2 \\\\approx 51.6 K. Van Krevelen recommends to choose :T_r\\\\,=\\\\,T_g+43 K, then :C_1 \\\\approx 8.86 and :C_2 \\\\approx101.6 K. Using such universal parameters allows one to guess the temperature dependence of a polymer by knowing the viscosity at a single temperature. In reality the universal parameters are not that universal, and it is much better to fit the WLF parameters to the experimental data, within the temperature range of interest.

Although initially approved of by Roman Catholic authorities, the group was later condemned for alleged heretical practices associated with Quietism.Sluhovsky, Moshe. Believe Not Every Spirit: Possession, Mysticism, & Discernment in Early Modern Catholicism. Page 115. University of Chicago Press, 2007. Giacomo Filippo di Santa Pelagia Giacomo Filippo di Santa Pelagia, born Giacomo Casolo, was an illiterate beggar in Milan. He took the middle name \\"Filippo\\" in honor of the missionary Filippo de Neri. He formed a confraternity in the church of Santa Pelagia to teach piety and mental prayer to the laity. At the time, he was granted the approval of the local Jesuits. After establishing this confraternity, he proceeded to Venice on invitation from associates of the Jesuits. After his time in Venice, he moved on to Brescia, visiting Valcamonica, a valley in this diocese, where he established an oratory dedicated to Saint Pelagia,Dooley, Brendan (ed.) Italy in the Baroque: Selected Readings. Pages 572-575. Garland Publishing, Inc., 1995. after first obtaining permission from Marco Morosini, the Bishop of Brescia, to establish oratories there.Lea, Henry Charles. A History of the Inquisition of Spain, Vol. IV. Pages 46-48. The MacMillan Company, 1922. Valcamonica became the center of the \\"Pelagian\\" movement. Church Investigation In a 1655 letter to the Holy Congregation of the Holy Office, Carlo Carafa, the nuncio in Venice (later a cardinal), described the Pelagians: After this letter was delivered, an investigation was launched by the Inquisitor of Brescia and Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, bishop of Brescia (later Pope Alexander VIII). The inquiry detailed that the oratories established by Giacomo Filippo di Santa Pelagia in Valcamonica were at first \\"attended by a small number of lay men and women\\", but their numbers had increased to around six-hundred. This increase occurred after Marco Antonio Recaldini (also spelled Ricaldini), the Padua-trained archpriest of Pisogne, took direction of the group. A report by Cardinal Francesco Degli Albizzi on Quietism described the growing role of the oratories: Condemnation After Albizzi's report reached Church authorities, a resolution was passed on March 1, 1657 for the Pelagian oratories in Valcamonica to be destroyed and that Marc Antonio Recaldini and seven of his associates were to be banned from Valcamonica and \\"held in places far from the said valley.\\" Cardinal Ottoboni was charged with the execution of these orders. Ottoboni's execution of these orders, however, did not prevent the continued popularity of \\"Quietist\\" circles of lay mystics in Italy. Giacomo Filippo di Santa Pelagia does not appear to have ever have been condemned himself. He died in Milan in June 1656 before the trial was concluded. The Archpriest of Morbegno was found in 1686 to be \\"distributing relics of him and collecting materials for his life and miracles.\\" He was forced to abandon this pursuit after receiving a summons from the Inquisitor of Como. Later, the Provost of Talamona was questioned regarding his motives in keeping a devotional picture of Giacomo. Aftermath After the 1656 condemnation, leadership was continued by Francesco Catanei and Marc Antonio Ricaldini. Marc Antonio's brother, Agostino Recaldini, a \\"married layman\\", may have had even greater influence. He was imprisoned in 1656 and was tortured three times. On September 19, 1660, he was exiled from the Valcamonica to Treviso. He was tried again there, apparently having persisted in his heretical views, and was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. A book of his was also publicly burnt. The Church renewed its persecutions in the 1680s, the group having had \\"maintained a secret existence for over twenty years\\", spreading beyond its original location to include oratories promoting mental prayer \\"in Brescia, Verona, Vincenza, Treviso, Padua, Pesaro, Lucca and countless other places.\\" By 1680, Agosto was free from prison and living under the supervision of the vicar general. Later, he left Treviso for Chiuro in the Valtelline. Antonio Ceccotti, the Inquisitor of Brescia, unsuccessfully attempted to persuade local authorities to extradite Recaldini. Ceccotti's efforts ended when he learned in March 1685 that Recaldini had died on October 6 of the previous year, after having received full sacraments and possessing a reputation for piety. In Brescia, a related group known as the Pellegrini practiced assiduous mental prayer. They had a membership of about six-hundred and were under the leadership of Bartolommeo Bona, a priest from Saint Rocco. In Verona, Giovanni Battista Bonioli led a group with similar aims, having about thirty members.

Edward Sutherland, written by Philip Wylie and Seton I. Miller. Considered particularly dark for its time, film critic Leonard Maltin called the film \\"astonishingly grisly.\\"TCM Database entry Plot Big-game hunter and wealthy zoologist Eric Gorman (Lionel Atwill) is an insanely jealous husband who uses his animal knowledge to dispose of his impulsive wife's lovers. The film opens in an Indian jungle with Gorman using a needle and thread to sew a colleague's mouth closed after having discovered that he had kissed his wife, and then he seals the man's fate by abandoning him in the jungle with the wild beasts. Gorman later pretends to be surprised at hearing that the man had been eaten by tigers. Both Gorman and his wife Evelyn (Kathleen Burke) then return to America aboard a ship packed with captured animals he intends to add to his collection at a major zoo. On the ship, Evelyn has a relationship with Roger Hewitt (John Lodge), which she tries to hide from her husband. Naturally, the murderously jealous Gorman finds out. Once back in the States, he begins to plot a way to get rid of Hewitt. The zoo is beginning to run into financial trouble and the new press agent, Peter Yates (Charles Ruggles), a man terrified of most of the zoo's animals and considered to be an alcoholic, suggests hosting a fundraising dinner for the rich to raise funds and awareness. The last straw is when Gorman finds his wife at Hewitt's apartment where they have been plotting their escape and her divorce. Gorman invites Hewitt to the dinner and uses it as the perfect opportunity to dispense his vengeance by poisoning Hewitt with mamba venom. He had obtained the poison after asking the zoo's laboratory doctor, Jack Woodford (Randolph Scott), to work on finding an antitoxin for the snake's fatal bite. When Hewitt unexpectedly dies at the fundraising dinner, Evelyn accuses her husband of being the murderer. Outraged, Gorman attacks her, but she is able to escape into his office where she finds a mechanical mamba head seeping with real mamba poison in his desk. She now knows for a fact that he killed Hewitt and takes the snake head with the intention to find Dr. Woodford. However, Gorman finds his wife, swears he did everything because he loves her, and prevents her from revealing his crime by throwing her to the alligators, where she is torn to shreds. The following day the zoo is still trying to find the snake and closes the facility. A group of children who sneak into the zoo discover tattered remains of Evelyn's dress. Dr. Woodford then becomes suspicious and accuses Gorman of murdering both his wife and Rodger Hewitt. Gorman disposes of Dr. Woodford by attacking him with the mechanical snake head just as he had done to Hewitt. The doctor's assistant Jerry (Gail Patrick) gives Woodford a shot of the antitoxin he had created for the mamba poison in time to save his life. She also realizes that Gorman is responsible for the apparent mamba attack when he tries to stop her, and has the zoo's alarms set off. A police chase ensues as Gorman is pursued through the zoo. Gorman releases big cats from the carnivore house in the hopes of keep back the police, but it backfires and a group them chases Gorman and force him into the cage of a boa constrictor, who then slowly kills and devours him. In the epilogue, Jerry visits a convalescing Dr. Woodford in the hospital. The stress, meanwhile, has caused Yates to fall off the wagon, and he is seen fearlessly meandering through the zoo, even swatting on the nose a still free lion that had been stalking him.The lion turns away and Yates drunkenly moseys on singing a song.

A. Evans  Reception  Murders in the Zoo was well received overall by its initial audience. The Los Angeles Times raved over the movie, saying, \\"Roars, shrieks, and cackling of the wild animals on the screen at the Paramount yesterday were echoed to an amazing degree by the audience, at times driven to a mild state of hysteria by scenes in 'Murders in the Zoo'.\\" However, a New York Times movie critic says, \\"Those who demand their leaven of romance even in horror pictures are likely to find 'Murders in the Zoo' inadequate in this direction.\\" Though he also claims that \\"it happens that the director has been almost too effective in dramatizing these cheerless events…Lionell Atwill as the insanely jealous husband is almost too convincing for comfort…[and judging] by its ability to chill and terrify, this film is a successful melodrama.\\" Mark Clark wrote an article on Lionel Atwill as an actor and says that Murders in the Zoo was the \\"quintessential Lionel Atwill film.\\" In the article Clark claims that \\"Atwill performs here with the quiet, coiled striking power of a beast tracking its prey. He glides effortlessly across the screen, speaking volumes with a barely perceptible change in tenor in his voice, unveiling his character's hidden passions with a simple, unguarded glance.\\" References External links  Category:1933 films Category:1933 horror films Category:American horror films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by A.

Primarily known for his work on the children's books, \\"The Three Investigators\\", he had a career that spanned over 50 years, doing work on paperback covers, advertising art, men's adventure magazines, movie posters and much more. Early life Kane was a self-taught artist who was born in Philadelphia in 1912. When he was younger he would go to the zoo and draw animals. He was extremely knowledgeable about art history and contemporary art and his thirst to better his skills led him to books by Howard Pyle and NC Wyeth, which he studied closely. Kane's career began during the great depression when he and a few of his artist friends left Philadelphia for New York City. It was difficult to find employment during this time. However, Kane's talent was getting noticed and around 1930 and eventually opened the door to Street & Smith. One of his first paying jobs, drawing for Western Story Magazine. Kane eventually married his wife Minna and they lived in Greenwich Village. When World War II began and Kane was drafted and sent to Hawaii to be a map maker. In 1941, Harry and his wife had their first child, a son they named Eugene. They soon realized that their son was handicapped. Eugene would spend much of his life in an institution. As Kane was stationed in Hawaii, Minna was left to raise Eugene on her own. She petitioned the army to release Kane early to help with Eugene but to no avail. The war ended in 1945 and Kane returned home. Upon returning from the war, Harry and Minna saw the birth of their next child Hadiya in 1946, with another daughter, Janice, coming along not long after. In 1970 he and his wife Minna divorced. Harry spent much of his free time with his disabled son. Professional years When Harry returned from the war he found his job was no longer waiting for him, so he began taking freelance jobs. He did work for Seagrams, Schlitz beer, Calso Gasoline Company, Phillip Morris and much more. In the mid-1960s Random House hired Harry to work on a new set of children's books called Alfred Hitchcock and The Three Investigators. Harry worked on most of the covers and interiors of the first 16 books and the series proved to be very popular selling millions of copies. Later years In the 1980s Kane was semi-retired and living quietly until poor health forced Kane to move to a nursing home. Kane died of an aneurism in March 1988.

Subsequently, during the 17th and 18th centuries, significant contraband took place on these shores as well as attempts to attack and ransack the Playa settlement. A lookout post was set up in El Vigia to warn the city of the need of help in the Playa harbor, a port settlement at the time. By the 1830s, la Playa had one of the best roads in Puerto Rico, connecting the shore settlement to the city proper, and it was the center of Ponce's commercial activity.

With El Equipo Crónica (“Chronicle Team”), formed by the artists Manolo Valdés and Rafael Solbes, Úrculo is considered one of the drivers of pop art in Spain. Early years Born in Santurtzi, Basque Autonomous Community, Spain, Úrculo had at least two siblings, brothers Jose Maria Úrculo and Maria del Mar Úrculo. The family moved to the mining village of Langreo, Asturias in 1941 because of the hardships imposed on them after the Spanish Civil War. With a childhood marked by famine, he joined the Instituto de Enseñanza Media in 1948. His interest in drawing began here after Úrculo discovered the art of Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh. and Amedeo Modigliani in picture books. At the age of 14, he dropped out of school to convalesce for several months from hepatitis and tuberculosis. During this time, he began to paint. When he was well enough, he started working in the mining company Carbones de La Nueva, where his father worked as a clerk. Úrculo's first solo exhibition occurred in 1957 in La Felguera. In the same year, he became a cartoonist, drawing gangster comics illustrations in Oviedo. The following year, he received a grant from the Langreo City Council to study at Madrid's Círculo de Bellas Artes and at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Gráficas. Here, his spiky socialist realism was characterized by \\"lots of clenched fists and Guernica-style Picassoism\\". His drawings of factories have been described as \\"social painting\\" or \\"social expressionism\\". Úrculo's early black and white drawings were influenced by Francisco Goya. In 1958, he went to Paris and studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumiere. Career Returning in 1959 to Oviedo, he opened a studio with the artist Zuco with whom he made the mosaic tile for ALSA. Military service took Úrculo to Tenerife in 1960 where he became acquainted with the surrealist artist Eduardo Westerdahl. Here he painted the only abstract work of his career. In 1962, he returned to Paris and painted in the style of figurative expressionism. Four years later, he went to Ibiza. In 1967, in Stockholm, he first encountered the American pop art of Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Robert Rauschenberg which he described as \\"un flechazo\\" (\\"love at first sight\\"). He drew inspiration from this by incorporating vibrant color into his pieces. In the 1970s, while traveling to Portugal, Morocco and Ibiza, Úrculo began his many works featuring the female nude. Referred to as Úrculo's \\"Period Erotica\\", he emphasized \\"el culo\\" (the backside). Culis monumentalibus (2001), a provocative and massive sculpture measuring in height, is located in Oviedo's square, and caused great controversy when it was installed. Úrculo's first bronze sculpture was created in 1984, and others soon followed, such as Homenaje a Santiago Roldán (\\"Tribute to James Roldan\\", 1993, Barcelona's Olympic Village), El regreso de Williams B. Arrensberg (\\"The return of Williams B. Arrensberg\\", 1993, Oviedo), and Exaltación de la manzana (\\"Exaltation of the apple\\", 1996, Villaviciosa). Perhaps his best-known bronze sculpture is El Viajero (Local Asturian dialect for \\"The Traveller\\") - the same (1993) piece described earlier by its formal name, \\"The Return of Williams B. Arrensberg\\". Now in the middle of a square, in the heart of Oviedo (Asturias) one can find our returning traveler, with bags, coat, and umbrella. Returning to Cubism, Úrculo painted still lifes of bottles, cases, and fruit in the manner of Juan Gris. In his later years, he painted geishas using eastern iconography, both as romantic escapism and as a sexual icon. He also painted many variations of hats. He participated in the First Biennial of Art in the City of Oviedo and, in 1986, was honored at the Painting Contest of Luarca. His last individual exhibitions were held at the Fundación Marcelino Botin of Santander and in the gallery Teresa Square, in Valladolid (2000). In addition to Spain, his works were displayed at expositions, collections and biennials in Germany, France, Cuba, Iran, and the United States. Personal life The marriage to his first wife, Annie Chanvallon, was dissolved. He married secondly Victoria Hidalgo. He had one son, Yoann. Úrculo died of a heart attack in 2003 at the Madrid home of Salvador Dalí, and was buried at the Iglesia de San Juan el Real in Oviedo. Honors Pinacoteca Eduardo Úrculo in La Felguera.

History and operations The institute to train school dropouts was the dream of Father Clement Sethupathy, a Sri Lankan missionary in Pakistan, since 1965. In 1985, he initiated a project that would make technical skills training available to them. Feasibility studies were done, plans made, and funding agencies contacted over several years. In August 1990, Misereor, the German Catholic bishops' development aid agency, agreed to finance the entire project. Its first batch of motor mechanics, welders and electricians graduated in 1993, after a single year of operation. The 27 graduates participating in the first commencement ceremonies on October 22, 1993, were addressed by Father Bashir Francis, vicar general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Faisalabad. In 1997, there were 45 young men learning and honing their skills in auto mechanics, electrical mechanics, plumbing and welding at the school, which has facilities to train 75 students at a time. Admission To qualify, a youth must be 15 to 24 years of age and must have completed eighth grade in school. Facilities The institute comprises the technical school and a residential Boys' Town. These are complementary and interdependent, both aiming to help young Christian men find more and better opportunities in life. Spread over three hectares in the suburbs of Faisalabad, the institute houses boarders as well as enrolling day students for technical courses. Administration In 2003, the Marist Brothers took over the management of the institute. On September 11, 2006, the Marist Brothers celebrated their forty-year presence in Pakistan with a thanksgiving Mass at the institute.

Released only to Japanese markets, the unit retailed in 1990 as a next generation successor to the 1983 C1 television also produced by Sharp and licensed by Nintendo. Like the C1, the SF1 was noted as having superior picture quality to a SFC plugged into a standard television.Soviero, Marcelle M. and Judith Anne Yeaple. \\"What's New: Entertaining Hybrid.\\" Popular Science. Vol.240, No.6. Pg.17. June 1992.  Overview  The SF1 came in two different models varying in screen sizes. The larger SF1 unit featured a 21-inch screen and the smaller featured a 14-inch screen.Lada, Jenni. Important Importables: Cool Super Famicom exclusives. Technology Tell. 23 September 2011. Both units were colored gray, and both included a ROM-cartridge plugin-slot just above the screen.Barnholt, Ray. The Island of Lost Hardware: TVs With an NES Inside . Retronauts. 7 April 2010. By merging the SFC and the television into one unit, the SF1 avoided the problem of exposed power cords and other cables. This gave the unit the advantage of being easier to handle. With internally connected SFC-SF1 terminals, luminance and chrominance signals could be separated, and the resulting image quality was notably sharper than standard setups. This advantage diminished to a degree in the 14-inch model where picture quality was reduced. Additional functions were added to the remote control such that the SFC portion of the unit can be reset by simultaneously pressing two buttons. Additionally, the remote control could be used to record gameplay on the VCR. Unlike the earlier Sharp Nintendo Television, AV output terminals were made readily accessible on the SF1's extended terminal which allowed connection to later peripherals such as the Satellaview. The C1 had been notably unable to connect to the Family Computer Disk System, and the SF1's design was intended to alleviate this problem with any Super Famicom peripherals. To use the extended terminal, the Satellaview's AV output terminal would attach obliquely upward on the back of the \\"console\\" portion of the set, and a cover could be applied to prevent dust. Doubts over the awkward attachment of expansion peripherals were among the reasons the unit never ultimately saw an international release.Brookes, Jason. \\"Gamefreak: SNES Tech & Gaming Answers.\\" Super Play.

When Wukong knew about this, he guarded his master inside the building he's sleeping. Therefore, burning all of the buildings in the temple except the building his master's in. However, when the Black Wind Demon came to the burning temple, he saw Tang Sanzang's cassock and stole it. When the abbot tried to find Sanzang's cassock, it was gone.

The Buddha shows up to subdue the demon and take him back to Vulture Peak. White Deer Spirit and White Faced Vixen Spirit The White Deer Spirit (白鹿精) is actually the mount of the deity Old Man of the South Pole. He stole his master's staff and escaped into the human world. He accepts the White Faced Vixen Spirit (白面狐狸精) as a daughter, disguises her as a beautiful maiden, and presents her to the ruler of the Kingdom of Biqiu (比丘國). The king is entranced by the vixen's charming looks and marries her, while the white deer (disguised as a middle-aged man) becomes the royal father-in-law (國丈). The king gradually falls sick under the demons' influence, and the white deer lies that the hearts of 1,111 children are required to make a cure. The king then issues an order to capture 1,111 children and imprison them in cages. When the protagonists arrive in Biqiu, the white deer tells the king that Tang Sanzang's heart is the best cure so the king orders Tang Sanzang to be arrested. Sun Wukong saves the children and exposes the demons' true forms. The vixen is slain by Zhu Bajie and the white deer is subdued and taken back by the Old Man of the South Pole. Lady Earth Flow Lady Earth Flow (地涌夫人) is actually a Golden Nosed Albino Rat Spirit (金鼻白毛老鼠精) who attained her powers after practising Taoist arts for 300 years. She once secretly consumed the Fragrant Blossoms Precious Candles (香花寶燭) at Vulture Peak, and called herself \\"Half-Guanyin\\" (半截觀音). She was captured by Li Jing and Nezha, and was supposed to be killed, but the Buddha told them to spare her life, and she was so grateful that she acknowledged Li Jing as her godfather and Nezha as her godbrother. She later moved to the Bottomless Pit (無底洞) at Flaming Air Mountain (焰空山) and renamed herself \\"Lady Earth Flow\\". She is armed with a pair of swords. When the protagonists pass by Black Pines Forest (黑松林), she disguises herself as a damsel in distress to attract Tang Sanzang's attention. Tang Sanzang takes pity on her and lets her accompany them to a nearby temple, but Sun Wukong sees through her cover. She ate six monks in the temple and captures Tang Sanzang when Sun Wukong and the others are distracted. Sun Wukong finds out her true identity later and brings Li Jing and Nezha to subdue her and take her back to Heaven. Ruler of the Kingdom of Miefa The ruler of the Kingdom of Miefa (滅法國; \\"Miefa\\" literally means \\"destroy dharma\\") hates Buddhists and once made an oath to slaughter 10,000 Buddhist monks. He has already killed 9,996 monks when the protagonists arrive in Miefa. To evade trouble, the protagonists disguise themselves as horse traders and hide in a big cupboard in an inn. However, that night, the cupboard is stolen by thieves but is recovered by the authorities and brought to the court. Sun Wukong cast sleeping spells on the royal household and officials and shaved their heads. The next morning, the king wakes up and is shocked to see that he, his family members, and his subjects are bald, just like Buddhist monks. He realizes that he has done wrong in persecuting Buddhist monks so he repents and renames his domain \\"Kingdom of Qinfa\\" (欽法國; \\"Qinfa\\" literally means \\"respect for dharma\\"). King of the Southern Hill The King of the Southern Hill (南山大王) is a demon king based in Linked Cave (連環洞), Bent Peak (折岳), Hidden Misty Mountain (隱霧山). He is armed with an iron pestle (鐵杵) and is capable of creating windstorms and mist. He is less powerful than other demon kings in the novel, but is considered one of the wittiest. He uses a plan called the \\"strategy of separating the plum blossom's petals\\" (分瓣梅花计) to lure Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing away from Tang Sanzang in three different instances and then captures Tang. Sun Wukong infiltrates his lair and casts a sleeping spell on the demon and his minions and saves Tang Sanzang. The demon is slain by Zhu Bajie just as he awakes, and his true form is revealed to be a leopard with mugwort-shaped patterns on its body. Grand Saint of Nine Spirits and associates The Grand Saint of Nine Spirits (九靈元聖) is actually the Nine Headed Lion that Taiyi Jiuku Tianzun rides on. The boy in charge of looking after the lion once secretly drank a special potion and fell asleep for three days in Heaven (equivalent to three years in the human world). The lion seizes the opportunity to escape. He builds his base at Jiuqu Panhuan Cave (九曲盤桓洞) at Bamboo Links Mountain (竹節山) near the Kingdom of Yuhua (玉華國). The lion demons living around that area revere him as their grand ancestor. The Nine Headed Lion is different from most other demons in the novel in a sense that it neither harms humans nor seeks to taste Tang Sanzang's flesh. He is angered when he learns that his god-grandson, the Tawny Lion Demon, has been killed by Sun Wukong, and wants to take revenge. He captures Tang Sanzang, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing and the royal family of Yuhua, and has them whipped. He is eventually subdued by Taiyi Jiuku Tianzun and taken back to Heaven. The Tawny Lion Demon (黃獅精) is based in Tiger's Jaws Cave (虎口洞), Leopard's Head Mountain (豹頭山) in the Kingdom of Yuhua. He is armed with a Four Clears Spade (四明鏟). He is a god-grandson of the Nine Headed Lion. Once, overcome by greed, he steals Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing's weapons. Although he does not harm humans and shows no interest in tasting Tang Sanzang's flesh, his avarice ultimately leads to disaster for him. Sun Wukong and his companions attack his cave and slaughter him and his minions to take back their weapons. His death is the catalyst for the conflict between the protagonists and the Nine Headed Lion. The Roushi (猱獅), Xueshi (雪獅), Suanni (()), Baize (白澤), Fuli (伏狸) and Boxiang (摶象) are six lion demons who used to inhabit the Jiuqu Panhuan Cave before the Nine Headed Lion came. They honour the Nine Headed Lion as their grand ancestor. They are captured by Sun Wukong and his companions and executed. Kings of Cold, Heat and Dust Protection The King of Cold Protection (辟寒大王), King of Heat Protection (辟暑大王) and King of Dust Protection (辟塵大王) are three demons based in Xuanying Cave (玄英洞), Azure Dragon Mountain (青龍山) in Jinping Prefecture (金平府). They are armed with a battleaxe, a broadsword, and a rattan staff respectively. Their true forms are rhinoceroses. They disguise themselves as buddhas and steal aromatic oil from lamps on a bridge, tricking worshippers into believing that the \\"buddhas\\" have accepted the oil offered to them. When Tang Sanzang goes to pay respects to the \\"buddhas\\", the demons capture him and flee. Sun Wukong and company try to save their master but are outnumbered by the demons and their minions, so they seek help from celestial forces. The demons are eventually defeated and killed by the combined efforts of Sun Wukong and company, the four Wood beasts of the 28 Mansions (Wood Wolf of Legs, Wood Dragon of Horn, Wood Dog of Well and Wood Dear of Dipper), and marine forces led by the Dragon Crown Prince of the Western Sea. Jade Rabbit Spirit Sun Wukong and the Moon Rabbit, depicted in Yoshitoshi's One Hundred Aspects of the Moon, 1889. The Jade Rabbit Spirit (玉兔精) is actually the moon rabbit that pounds a mortar and pestle in Guanghan Palace (廣寒宮) on the Moon. The fairy Su'e (素娥) once hit her and she bore a grudge against her. Su'e was later reincarnated as a princess of India (天竺). The rabbit escapes into the human world to take revenge against Su'e. She lives in Maoying Mountain (毛穎山) and wields a short staff (transformed from the pestle) as her weapon. She kidnaps the princess of India and impersonates her. She meets Tang Sanzang when he passes by India on his journey, and wants to marry him so that she can absorb his yang essence and increase her powers. Sun Wukong sees through her disguise and fights with her. Just as Sun Wukong is about to defeat the Jade Rabbit, the moon goddess, Chang'e, shows up, stops him, assumes custody of the wayward-rabbit, and takes her back to the Moon and to her work. Great White Turtle The Great White Turtle (大白龜) is a giant turtle based in Heaven Reaching River (通天河). He was forced out of his underwater residence by the King of Spiritual Touch. Sun Wukong brings Guanyin to subdue and take away the demon. He feels so grateful to the protagonists for helping him take back his home that he ferries them across the 800 li river on his back. Before moving on, Tang Sanzang promises to help the turtle ask the Buddha when he will be able to transform into a human. However, Tang Sanzang forgets his promise when he arrives at his destination, Vulture Peak, where the Buddha is based. The guardians transporting the protagonists back to Chang'an drop them off abruptly at Heaven Reaching River, where the protagonists meet the turtle again. While ferrying the protagonists across the river, the turtle asks Tang Sanzang about the promise he made and the latter apologises for breaking his word. The unhappy turtle throws them off his back into the water and they swim to the shore. This incident fulfils the last of the 81 tribulations that Tang Sanzang is destined to face on his journey to obtain the real scriptures.

She is depicted as Roger's human toon wife in various Roger Rabbit media. Jessica is renowned as one of the best-known sex symbols in animation.THE LAST MOVIE STAR from Entertainment Weekly. She is also well known for the line: \\"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\\" Development Author Gary K. Wolf based Jessica primarily on the cartoon character Red from Tex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood. The film version of the character was inspired by various actresses. Richard Williams explained, \\"I tried to make her like Rita Hayworth; we took her hair from Veronica Lake, and Zemeckis kept saying, 'What about the look Lauren Bacall had?'\\" He described that combination as an \\"ultimate male fantasy, drawn by a cartoonist.\\" Before Robert Zemeckis was brought on board as director, Jessica had a different design, and was to be voiced by Russi Taylor. Taylor would go on to provide the voice in test footage from 1981. When Zemeckis was hired, he brought along Kathleen Turner to voice Jessica, whom he had worked with in Romancing the Stone. Turner, who went uncredited, accepted the role because she was pregnant and \\"just had to show up and do her voice.\\" Character synopsis In the novel, Jessica was an immoral, up-and-coming star, and former comic character with whom her estranged husband (comic strip star Roger Rabbit) became obsessed. She is re-imagined in the film as a sultry, but moral, cartoon singer at a Los Angeles supper club called The Ink and Paint Club. She is one of several suspects in the framing of her husband, who is a famous cartoon star accused of murder. She is voiced by Kathleen Turner, who was uncredited for her role. Amy Irving was cast to sing \\"Why Don't You Do Right?\\" (a blues song made famous by Peggy Lee) for Jessica's first scene in the movie. According to animation director Richard Williams, other than being a feisty-redhead female human toon temptress, she deeply loves her husband Roger. She even calls him her \\"honey-bunny\\" and \\"darling.\\" She claims that he makes her laugh, is a better lover than a driver and that he's \\"better than Goofy\\" after Roger attempts to save her from Judge Doom and the Toon Patrol. As proof of her love, she tells Eddie that she'll pay any price for Roger and she even helps prove him innocent by helping in the investigation. Even though she's a human Toon, she is shown to have a few of the comedic cartoon antics typical of other Toons. One such example was her cleavage having a hammerspace ability, as one of the weasels searched her (with obvious perverted intent) for Marvin Acme's last will and testament, only to comically get his hand caught in a bear trap, with Valiant commenting on the event with a pun (\\"Nice booby trap\\"). Another could be her restrained \\"wild take\\" (as she shouts, \\"Oh, my God, it's Dip!!!\\") seeing Judge Doom's scheme involving the Dip, while a subtle effect was added by animator Russell Hall: The bounce of Jessica's bosom was reversed from that of a real woman so that it would bounce up when a real woman's breasts bounce down and vice versa. Furthermore, when she blows kisses (as seen to Eddie in one scene) the lip-kisses are also done in a cartoonish style.Trivia for Who Framed Roger Rabbit After the film, Jessica also appeared in the Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman shorts Tummy Trouble as a nurse, Roller Coaster Rabbit as a damsel in distress, and Trail Mix-Up as a park ranger. In Tummy Trouble and Roller Coaster Rabbit, she made no impression. But in Trail Mix-Up, Roger fantasizes over her, calling her a \\"babe in the woods\\" and panting like a dog. She also appeared frequently in the Roger Rabbit comic book series, and she had her own feature in most issues of Roger Rabbit's Toontown such as \\"Beauty Parlor Bedlam,\\" where she comes face to face with female weasel counterpart, Winnie. Though Jessica didn't physically appear in the Disney film Aladdin and the King of Thieves, a cardboard cut-out of her body (from the neck-down) was visible for a few seconds while Genie was picking wedding dresses for Princess Jasmine, to which he did the Wolf- whistle. She was mentioned in the 1991 Tiny Toon Adventures episode \\"New Character Day,\\" while her legs were briefly seen out a limo door in the episode \\"Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian.\\" Legacy With the success of the film and upon the opening of Disney’s Hollywood Studios on May 1, 1989, the film's characters featured prominently in the company. After taking the Studio Backlot Tour, various props decorated the streets including two different photo opportunities with Jessica: a glittery cardboard cutout and \\"The Loony Bin\\" photo shop which allowed you to take pictures in costume standing next to an actual cartoon drawing of characters from the film. There was also a plethora of merchandise including Jessica Rabbit rub-on stickers called \\"pressers\\". The Jessica Rabbit Store, entitled \\"Jessica's\\", was once part of Pleasure Island, Disney's nightclub attraction and shopping area. The store included a giant two-sided neon Jessica sign with sequined dress and swinging leg and featured nothing but Jessica Rabbit merchandise. The store closed in 1992. Her line \\"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way\\" became one of the most popular quotes from the film, and was nominated as one of the 400 greatest movie quotes by AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, ultimately failing to make the final list. Jessica Rabbit was named number six on Empire's list of the 50 Best Animated Movie Characters in 2010. Kathleen Turner, the speaking voice of Jessica Rabbit, stated in an interview that she is asked more often to sign photos of Jessica Rabbit than herself. Reception Jessica Rabbit has received positive reviews and is described as a sex symbol among classic animated characters, commonly ranked among other animated characters such as Betty Boop and Red Hot Riding Hood. According to research by Cadbury Dairy Milk, Jessica Rabbit remains the most alluring character in cartoons. Her red dress was also among the most recognized clothing worn by an animated character along with Snow White's dress. In 2008, Jessica Rabbit was selected by Empire as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All-Time, explaining that despite being drawn as a classic femme fatale, one of the movie's strengths is to allow the character to play against the stereotype\\". She was also ranked as the sixth greatest animated character by the same magazine stating that \\"there's more to her than just the sort of lines that would clean sweep America's Next Top Model. There's a pure heart and ready wit beneath that magnificent exterior.\\" Internet Movie Database had a poll that ranked her as the most alluring Disney character according to votes from audiences of the page. Controversy With the release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in LaserDisc, Variety first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of Jessica Rabbit in the film. While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the LaserDisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the LaserDisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.

The internal state of an organism is in constant change, and any stimulus that can help to correct an error or need will be pleasantly perceived. For example, food will be more pleasant when hungry compared to when an organism is satiated. The sensation aroused therefore depends not only on the quality or on the intensity of the stimulus, but also on the internal state of the organism as sensed by internal receptors. The relationship between the perceptual system and physiology is subjective and studied by psychophysics.

The creative and nonconventional process of sensory art therapy often elicits better results for individuals who suffer from chronic stress, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as those who have been diagnosed with learning/development disabilities.  History   Early years  Margaret Namburg, Edith Kramer, Hanna Kwiatkowska and Elinor Ulman have been credited with being the pioneers of the field of sensory art therapy. While all of these scientists made significant contributions, Margaret Namburg has been hailed the \\"Mother of Art Therapy\\". Her work focused on the use of art, mainly as a psychoanalytic diagnostic tool. It followed closely other psychoanalytic practices of the time, and was viewed as the communication of unconscious ideas and emotions that were being expressed by the patient.Malchiodi, Cathy (2003). Handbook of Art Therapy. New York: The Guilford Press. pp. 8–10.  Modern approaches  Today's art therapy is broken down into three different approaches: psychodynamic, humanistic, learning and developmental. The psychodynamic approach uses terms such as \\"transference\\" and defense mechanism to describe why individuals express the art in the way they do, and why this is an expression of the subconscious. The humanistic approach is more of a positive psychology approach, and is defined by an optimistic view of humans, and how expression through their art allows them to take control over these emotions. The learning and developmental approach focuses on the art therapy as a method to assist children who have emotional and developmental disabilities.  Types  Many different types of art therapy have been developed over the years in order to combat different types of pain, anxiety or stressors in the lives of patients. Different techniques have also been developed to ensure that art therapy can help as many diverse people as possible.  Art therapy  * Art therapy is a technique that is utilized by many people and is by far the most popular therapy. * It consists of painting, drawing, photography, sculpture and other visual arts that are normally thought of as \\"traditional\\" forms of art.\\"What is Art Therapy?  What Does an Art Therapist Do?\\". Art Therapy. Retrieved 2017-05-14. * This type of therapy has been shown to be extremely beneficial for relieving stress, and the psychodynamic approach is often used, as the therapist uses the drawings or paintings of the individual to gain perspective on what is taking place in the subconscious. * The most empirical research has been done on this type of therapy, and it has yielded the most significant improvements in patients.  Dance/movement therapy  * For over 75 years, this type of therapy has been used because many therapists view movement as the most important way to elicit therapeutic transformation. This therapy has been primarily used to explore and deal with early childhood relationships that may have been negative, and work to repair these relationships, as well as the negative effects they have had on the individual.Houghton, Rebecca; Beebe, Beatrice (2016-12-01). \\"Dance/Movement Therapy: Learning to Look Through Video Microanalysis\\". American Journal of Dance Therapy. 38 (2): 334–357. doi:10.1007/s10465-016-9226-0. ISSN 0146-3721. * Movement analyses such as the Kestenberg Movement Profile (KMP) and the Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) have been used as a way to measure development and therapeutic success. ** The KMP looks at tension-flow and shape flow rhythms, and has been used to explore mother-infant interactions. ** The LMA focuses on effort, direction, space and force. * Because of its ability to incorporate both motor and cognitive functions, dance has been hailed as one of the more useful and holistic approaches.  Music therapy  * There are four types of musical therapy that are used: improvisation, re-creative, composition and receptive music experience.Bruscia, K. (1998). \\"Defining Music Therapy\\". Gilsum. 2nd. ** The first three (improvisation, re-creative and composition) require the patient to perform or play music. ** The last one (receptive music experience) involves a patient or client listening to music. * Music therapy has also been used to help patients with neurological developmental disorders. * These have been effect methods because of music's ability to evoke emotions, and researchers have found that music regulates emotions (Irhp.org). ** For instance, many songs elicit specific and strong emotions, and if the song is tied with a particularly traumatic memory, it helps the psychologist reach those memories and explore them with the patient. * It is a valuable tool when verbal communication isn't possible, for example with infants, patients with dementia, or severe developmental disorders.  Writing and acting therapy  * Writing therapy has been shown to reduce stress and improve health. Smyth (1998) did a case study on 13 writing therapy studies and found that overall, there was a 23% health advantage for writing groups in the study.Smyth, J. M. (1998). Written emotional expression: effect sizes, outcome types, and moderating variables. * One drawback with this technique is that participants reported higher anxiety and negative mood after writing, and some have stated that they think this negative effect can diminish the benefits of the therapy.Pizarro, J. (2004). The efficacy of art and writing therapy: Increasing positive mental health outcomes and participant retention after exposure to traumatic experience. Art Therapy, 21(1), 5-12. * Because acting forces an individual to impersonate a character, it forces a person to control not only their bodies, but their personality as well. This approach is seen as the most holistic type of sensory art therapy.  Benefits  # Self-discovery #* This discovery often leads to a relief of emotional tension caused by past events, and can be used as a coping mechanism.\\"Sensory art therapies\\". TheFreeDictionary.com. Retrieved 2017-05-10. # Empowerment #* Art therapy gives individuals the ability to articulate their fears and stresses in a non- conventional way, and often leads to sense of control over these emotions. # Stress relief #* Effective for stress relief by itself, but can provide even better results if paired with other relaxation devices such as guided imagery. # Physical pain relief and rehabilitation #* Art therapy has been shown to help decrease pain in patients who are recovering from illness and injury. It has also been used in patients who are chronically or terminally ill, to provide relief and pain control.  Empirical evidence   Ball (2002)  Ball conducted long-term research on five children who were considered to be severely emotionally disturbed. These children participated in 50 art therapy sessions, and the results suggested that the art therapy was successful, and the children showed marked progress in their treatment over the course of the 50 sessions.Ball, B. (2002). Moments of change in the art therapy process. The Arts in Psychotherapy, 29(2), 79–92.  Pifalo (2006)  In this study, 41 girls or young women who had been sexually abused were given structured group art therapy for eight weeks, and were measured before treatment using the Briere's Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). They were given the test again after the treatment, and for 9 out of 10 of the girls, a statistically significant reduction in scores on the test were observed.Pifalo, T. (2006). Art therapy with sexually abused children and adolescents: Extended research study. Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association, 23(4), 181–185.  Bar-Sela, Atid, Danos, Gabay & Epelbaum (2007)  This study worked with 60 adults who had cancer. These adults attended weekly individual art therapy, in addition to watercolor painting classes. After just four sessions, the experimental group saw marked and significant improvement in depression and fatigue, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a brief fatigue inventory. While they showed a decrease in depression, there was no significant difference in the levels of anxiety of the patients.Bar-Sela, G., Atid, L., Danos, S., Gabay, N., & Epelbaum, R. (2007).

The book combines material from Zinn's history book A People's History of the United States and his autobiography You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train with new material from other sources, most notably George Lipsitz's A Rainbow at Midnight: Labor and Culture in the 1940s and Jim Zwick's Mark Twain's Weapons of Satire: Anti-Imperialist Writings on the Philippine-American War.Zinn, Howard & Buhle, Paul. A People's History of American Empire. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2008. p.265 Various historic subjects are covered as well as Zinn's own history of involvement in activism and historic events. The book was the last of Zinn's books that was published within his lifetime. The book's story is based around a frame story of Zinn giving a speech at an anti-war rally. Through it, he talks about past acts of imperialism by the U.S. government, as well as acts of resistance to it both inside and outside of the country. During the story, comparisons are made between the American government's past actions and recent ones, often appearing in boxes marked as \\"Zinnformation\\" Overview The Prologue begins with Zinn writing an article on his typewriter about his reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks and his anger at President George W. Bush for reacting in a way that Zinn saw as ahistorical (this article was \\"The Old Way of Thinking\\", which appeared in Progressive Magazine).Zinn, Howard. \\"The Old Way of Thinking\\". Progressive. November 2001. He goes on to criticize the military actions in the War in Afghanistan that led to the deaths of civilians. The chapter ends with Zinn giving a speech at an anti-war rally, which becomes a speech on America's past acts of imperialism. Chapter I, \\"The Internal Empire\\", starts by covering the Wounded Knee Massacre, narrated by survivor Black Elk. It goes on to cover the Robber Barons (specifically J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, and George Pullman); strikes during 1892 such as the Copper Miners Strike, the New Orleans General Strike, the Railroad Switchmen's Strike, and the Steelworkers' Strike; the 1894 Railroad Strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company and Eugene V. Debs involvement in it; the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door Policy; the invasion of Hawaii in 1893; and the 103 interventions carried out in other countries by the U.S. between 1798 and 1895, including Japan (1853–54), Nicaragua (1853–54), Uruguay (1855), Argentina (1853–54), and Angola (1860). Chapter II, \\"The Spanish–American War\\", is about the events of the Spanish–American War. Various people who were involved in the events of the war and those leading up to it are discussed, such as Antonio Maceo Grajales, Máximo Gómez, José Martí, Clemencia Arango. Other topics covered include the media hype for the war created by William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzer's New York World (which led to the concept of yellow journalism); the explosion of the , which the two newspapers blamed on the Spanish; the actions of labor unions, which supported the Cuban rebels but not U.S. intervention; the Black 25th Infantry and its experience with racism at the hands of the Rough Riders; the poisoning of soldiers by spoiled meat packaged by Armour and Co.; and the takeover of Cuba by the U.S. and Chapter III, \\"The Invasion of the Philippines\\", covers the events of the Philippine–American War. It begins with explaining how the end of the Spanish–American War resulted in the U.S. gaining the former Spanish colonies of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, and explains that William McKinley believed he had to take over the Philippines from its native people in order to \\"civilize and Christianize\\" them. Afterwards, it shows the struggles of Emilio Aguinaldo in trying to keep control of the Philippines for its own people. Other topics and individuals covered include George Dewey, Fermín Jáudenes, Fort San Antonio de Abad, the Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation, the battle of Santa Mesa, William Jennings Bryan, Albert J. Beveridge, Henry M. Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Littletown Waller, the shootings at Samar, Elihu Root, Theodore Roosevelt, the use of the water cure in the war, Leonard Wood, the Moro Crater massacre, Mark Twain, and the Anti-Imperialist League. Chapter IV, \\"War is the Health of the State\\", covers World War I and the events leading into it. It begins with discussing how the U.S. government used its military power to protect American business interests both within the country and abroad during such events as the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution and the Ludlow Massacre. Zinn goes on to explain how the U.S. and European countries entered into World War I to gain imperial power over Africa, the Balkans, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Middle- East, while the U.S. itself also entered to increase patriotism and to weaken the growing popular interest in socialism. Other topics and individuals covered include Woodrow Wilson, Randolph Bourne, Robert Lansing, Bernard Baruch, William Gibbs McAdoo, the , the Sykes–Picot Agreement, the Conscription Act of 1917, the Espionage Act of 1917, Champ Clark, the American Protective League, the Industrial Workers of the World, Camp Funston, Sheldon W. Smith, Leavenworth Prison, Kate Richards O'Hare, Alice Paul, the National Women's Party, and Emma Goldman. Chapter V, \\"Growing Up Class-Conscious\\", covers Zinn's childhood and teenage years. Zinn begins the chapter by telling about how his community worked together to get through the Great Depression and their reaction to the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. He goes on to tell of how he began to understand poverty through reading the works of Charles Dickens, working with his father as a waiter, and getting involved in a demonstration with some of the communists in his neighborhood. These led to Zinn becoming class-conscious and abandoning his liberal views for radical ones. Chapter VI, \\"World War II: A People's War?\\" covers some key events in World War II and Zinn's service/perspective. He was a ship fitter in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and while a United States Army Air Corps bombarder, married Roslyn Shechter. He notes racial segregation on board his transport ship. He writes that it was the most popular war the US ever fought, with widespread support across many classes of people, but was launched with political deceptions and policy driven by corporate interests, such as: the US claimed Pearl Harbor a sneak attack but records two weeks earlier show that we anticipated war with Japan; Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) claimed German submarines launched unprovoked attacks but the US had really been waging undeclared war with Germany in the Lend-Lease program as an Arsenal of Democracy contrary to Neutrality Acts of 1930s. By 1941 there were over 4,000 strikes, more than any time since 1919. FDR had troops seize mines in a strike May 1943. 6,000 war resistors, three times as many as World War I, went to prison. Unions enrolled 1.25M new African-America workers and this led to hate strikes such as in 1943 at Packard. The military demanded that Charles Richard Drew, an African-American doctor who invented blood banks, segregate blood by race and after refusing, they fired him from an Army/Navy blood drive. FDR signed Executive Order 9066 leading arrest of every US west coast Japanese. The US extends the Open Door Policy from Asia into Europe, marking an increased involvement in European affairs.

Violi was born in Sinopoli, Calabria, Italy, in 1931; his father Domenico was the boss of the Violi clan in his hometown. Violi immigrated to Southern Ontario in 1951. He married Grazia Luppino, daughter of the boss of the Luppino crime family in Hamilton. He later moved to Montreal where he became associated with in the Calabrese compatriot Cotroni crime family which had most of the control in Montreal. In the late 1970s, boss Vincenzo Cotroni transferred the day-to-day activities of the family to Violi, and a mob war soon broke out between the Calabrian and Sicilian factions led by Nicolo Rizzuto. The war resulted in the murder of Violi on January 22, 1978, as well as his brothers, as the Sicilian Rizzuto crime family emerged as the preeminent crime family in Montreal by the early 1980s. After Violi's death, his widow and two sons, Domenico and Giuseppe moved to Hamilton; the Violi brothers became affiliated with the Luppino crime family, later also becoming known as the Luppino-Violi crime family. Early career Violi was born in Sinopoli, Calabria on February 6, 1931.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 258 Violi was born into the mob; his father Domenico Violi was the head of the 'Ndrangheta Violi clan in Sinopoli. Violi later immigrated to Southern Ontario in 1951.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 259 In 1955, he fatally shot Natale Brigante in Toronto, sustaining a stab wound from Brigante. He was charged with manslaughter in a Welland court, but was acquitted claiming it was self-defense, showing the stab wound as evidence. Violi gained Canadian citizenship in 1956 and by the early 1960s was running illegally manufactured liquor from Ontario to Quebec. He became associated with boss of the Hamilton Luppino crime family Giacomo Luppino, but left for Montreal in 1963 on Luppino's orders to avoid clashes with other Hamilton mobster Johnny Papalia. In Quebec, Violi opened the Reggio Bar in Saint-Leonard in the mid 1960s, which he used as a base for extortion. He developed connections with the Cotroni crime family, while maintaining ties with the Luppino family; he married Giacomo Luppino's daughter, Grazia in 1965. In the 1960s and 70s, boss Vincenzo Cotroni used associate William \\"Obie\\" Obront to supervise a bookmaking network in the Ottawa-Hull area that handled around $50,000 in bets per day, with 25 percent going to Violi.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 262 Obie also served as Cotroni chief banker and financial adviser, responsible for laundering money. For Montreal's Expo 67, Obie also helped the Cotronis land the meat and vending machine supply contract—most of which was tainted meat.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 264 In December 1970, his bar was bugged with wiretaps by Robert Menard, an undercover police officer who rented the space above Violi's bar for several years, which were later used in subsequent cases. In 1974, Violi and Cotroni were overheard on a police wiretap threatening to kill Hamilton mobster Johnny Papalia and demanding $150,000 after he used their names in a $300,000 extortion plot without notifying or cutting them in on the score. The three were convicted of extortion in 1975 and sentenced to six years in prison. Violi and Cotroni appealed and got their sentences reduced to six months, but Papalia's appeal was rejected.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 326 The following year, Violi was arrested to stand before the Quebec government's Commission d'enquête sur le crime organisé (CECO) inquiry into organized crime; he was sent to jail for one year for contempt. Mob war and death In the early 1970s, Cotroni transferred the day-to-day activities of the family to his Calabrian compatriot Violi, a capodecina together with Nicolas Di Iorio, Frank Cotroni and Luigi Greco.Auger and Edwards The Encyclopedia of Canadian Organized Crime p.195.L'atentat, p. 65 Cotroni's role became more that of an adviser to the younger Calabrian.La Presse, 1er décembre 1973Idem, p. 63 Greco led the Sicilian faction of the family until his death in 1972.Lamothe, Lee.

Violi complained about the independent modus operandi of his Sicilian 'underlings', Nicolo Rizzuto in particular. \\"He is going from one side to the other, here and there, and he says nothing to nobody, he is doing business and nobody knows anything,\\" Violi said about Rizzuto. Violi asked for more 'soldiers' from his Bonanno bosses, clearly preparing for war, and Violi's boss at the time, Vic Cotroni remarked: \\"Me, I'm capodecina. I got the right to expel.\\" Violi requested permission from the New York bosses to kill Rizzuto, but the request was turned down. In 1977, Rizzuto and Violi met face-to-face in the home of a Montreal resident for a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences, according to a police report. But the peace talks failed, and most of the Rizzuto family fled to Venezuela. This led to a power struggle mob war in Montreal which began with the murder of Pietro Sciara on Valentine's Day in 1976, Violi's consigliere, who was now acting boss; Sciara's body was left in the street after seeing an Italian-dubbed version of The Godfather Part II with his wife. On February 8, 1977, Francesco Violi, the younger brother of Paolo, the family enforcer, was murdered by several shotgun wounds. Shortly after Violi was released from the brief jail sentence with relation to the CECO inquiry, he sold his bar to brothers Vincenzo and Giuseppe Randisi; the name was changed to Bar Jean- Talon. On January 22, 1978, Paolo Violi was shot in the head at close range with a lupara in the Bar Jean-Talon after being invited to play cards by Vincenzo Randisi. Violi's funeral was five days later at Church of the Madonna della Difesa, and was buried at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Aftermath Although Nicolo Rizzuto was in Venezuela at the time of Violi's murder, his brother-in-law Domenico Manno, was believed to play a major role in the murder under Rizzuto's orders. Manno received a seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to conspiring to kill Violi, as well as Rizzuto confidant Agostino Cuntrera, who received a five-year sentence in relation to Violi's murder. The war ended on October 17, 1980, when Rocco Violi, the last of Violi's brothers, was seated, for a family meal, at his kitchen table in his Montreal home when a single bullet from a sniper's rifle struck him dead.A Mafia hit loaded with symbolism, National Post, November 12, 2010 Cotroni died of cancer on September 16, 1984.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 280 By the mid 1980s, the Rizzuto crime family emerged as Montreal's pre-eminent crime family after the turf war. After Paolo Violi's death, his widow and two sons, Domenico (Dom) and Giuseppe (Joe) moved to Hamilton, Ontario, an area controlled by the Buffalo crime family and 'Ndrangheta families. A 2002 Halton Police report suggested the Violi brothers were affiliated with the Luppino-Violi crime family in Hamilton started by their grandfather Giacomo Luppino. Domenico Violi subsequently became the underboss of the Buffalo crime family in 2017; the first Canadian to hold the second-highest position in the American Mafia.

Lion was one of several ships sent into the Western Mediterranean by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet based at the Tagus in Portugal during the late spring of 1798. The Spanish squadron was a raiding force that had sailed from Cartagena in Murcia seven days earlier, and was intercepted while returning to its base after an unsuccessful cruise. Although together the Spanish vessels outweighed the British ship, individually they were weaker and Commodore O'Neil failed to ensure that his manoeuvrees were co-ordinated. As a result, one of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, fell out of the line of battle and was attacked by Lion. Despite ineffectual long-range gunfire towards the British ship by the remainder of the Spanish squadron, the isolated Santa Dorotea was rapidly forced to surrender, O'Neil eventually turning the other three frigates back towards Cartagena. Unopposed, Dixon was able to consolidate his prize and send it to St Vincent's fleet off Cadiz, where it was subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy. Lion remained in the Mediterranean during the year, later participating in the blockades of Malta and Alexandria. The Spanish, their seaports carefully guarded by Royal Navy squadrons, launched no further expeditions into the Mediterranean during the year. Background At the start of 1798, the Mediterranean Sea was entirely under the control of the French Navy and their allies, including Spain, which had switched sides in the French Revolutionary Wars in late 1796 at the Treaty of San Ildefonso.Rose, p. 140 Denied access to deep water ports and adequate supplies, the Royal Navy fleet deployed in the Mediterranean under Vice- Admiral Sir John Jervis was forced to withdraw to the nearest friendly fleet anchorage, at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal.Maffeo, p. 224 Although forced to retreat, Jervis' force was not defeated and on 14 February 1797 he achieved a victory over the Spanish Navy at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, capturing four Spanish ships of the line.Clowes, p. 318 A blockade of the Spanish Atlantic ports was instituted, especially Cadiz, the large southern fleet anchorage, and the Spanish did not again attempt to break out during the remainder of the year. Early in 1798, rumours reached Jervis, recently ennobled as Earl St Vincent, of a buildup of French forces around the Mediterranean seaport of Toulon under General Napoleon Bonaparte. Similar rumours had reached the Admiralty in London, and St Vincent therefore sent Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson and three ships of the line to observe French activity.Clowes, p. 351 Nelson arrived too late however, and the French fleet had already sailed, carrying over 30,000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean. Nelson, joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by St Vincent under Captain Thomas Troubridge, pursued the French, but failed to learn of their destination before the French fleet captured Malta. Ten days later, Bonaparte sailed for Alexandria for the second stage of his operation and Nelson's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night, the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived.Adkins, p. 15 While Nelson was crossing the Mediterranean, St Vincent was taking advantage of the absence of enemy forces in the Western Mediterranean to deploy newly arrived warships to the region.Gardiner, p. 54 One of these vessels was the 64-gun ship of the line HMS Lion, under the command of Captain Manley Dixon, who had been sent to St Vincent's fleet early in the year as a replacement for one of Troubridge's ships. Initially ordered to patrol the Spanish Mediterranean coast, Lion was cruising southeast of Cartagena, a port in the Spanish Region of Murcia at 09:00 on 15 July when four sails were spotted to the southeast.James, p. 225 Battle The four sails spotted by Lion's lookout were a squadron of Spanish frigates that had departed Cartagena on 8 July for a brief and unsuccessful commerce raiding operation in the Western Mediterranean. Each ship carried 34 guns and a weight of shot of approximately to Lion's . On sighting Lion, the Spanish ships formed a battle line, with Commodore Felix O'Neil's flagship Pomona under Captain Don Francis Villamil in the lead followed by Proserpine under Captain Don Quaj. Bial, Santa Dorotea under Captain Don Manuel Gerraro and Santa Cazilda under Captain Don Deam. Errara. Seeking to engage the strangers, Dixon bore up, halting his movement to ensure he held the weather gage. This would enable him to manoeuvre with the wind and attack the Spanish at the time of his choosing. Seizing the advantage, Dixon then bore down on the frigate squadron, which prepared to meet the attack.Clowes, p. 511 One of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, had lost a topmast sometime earlier and as result was slower than the rest of the squadron. Falling behind the others, Gerraro soon found that his ship was in danger of being isolated by Lion, as Dixon steered for the rapidly opening gap between the Spanish ships. Recognising the danger, O'Neil ordered the front three frigates to turn around and sail to the defence of Santa Dorotea, passing close by Lion and opening a heavy fire at 11:15. Lion replied, and the Spanish frigates did not immediately turn back for a second pass, continuing ahead as Dixon closed with the straggling Santa Dorotea.Gardiner, p. 54 In an effort to deter the ship of the line, Gerraro opened fire on Lion with his stern chasers, cannon situated in the frigate's stern, which caused considerable damage to Dixon's rigging. As Lion began to close the distance, O'Neil's ships returned, but the frigates passed Lion at extreme distance, their broadsides having no effect and again coming under fire themselves. Eventually, Dixon succeeded in bringing his ship alongside the Spanish frigate and opened a heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered.James, p. 226 As Santa Dorotea veered off course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed to have an effect and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10.Clowes, p. 512 Gerraro, his isolated ship trapped by Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender. Aftermath Santa Dorotea had suffered severe damage during the brief engagement, and had at least 20 men killed and 32 wounded from a crew of 371. By contrast, Lion had lost just two men wounded in the exchange: a seaman lost a leg and a midshipman was shot in the shoulder. Although Lion's rigging had been badly torn, there was no structural damage at all. Securing his prize, Dixon spent the next day conducting extensive repairs before sending Santa Dorotea to Earl St Vincent off Cadiz. The captured ship was purchased into the Royal Navy and served for several years as HMS Santa Dorotea, rated at 36 guns.Clowes, p. 560 The prize money generated by the sale of the captured ship and the stores aboard was paid out to the Dixon's crew in October 1800. Nearly five decades later the Admiralty recognised the action with the clasp \\"LION 15 JULY 1798\\" attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Lion remained in the Western Mediterranean for the next two months, eventually joining with a squadron of four Portuguese ships of the line under the command of Tomás Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, Marquess de Niza.James, p. 188 In September, Niza's squadron was ordered to join Nelson in his search for the French and sailed eastwards, but while passing to the north of Malta they encountered a large convoy of battered vessels under Captain Sir James Saumarez. These ships were seven British ships of the line and six captured French ships, all survivors of the Battle of the Nile, Nelson's successful conclusion of the campaign fought at Aboukir Bay off Egypt on 1 August. The Anglo-Portuguese squadron continued to Alexandria in October, briefly joining the blockade squadron there under Captain Sir Samuel Hood before returning to Malta in December as part of a new squadron formed off the island.James, p. 193 Lion followed the Portuguese back to Malta in December.Clowes, p. 377 The Spanish did not launch another expedition from their Mediterranean ports during 1798.James, p. 195 Notable participants José de San Martín was a staff member on the Santa Dorothea.

Earlier in the story, he was also responsible for luring Mizuki to a secluded area in the school, so that rogue members of the Karate Club could imprison her and keep her out of the 2,000 meter relay. However, he felt extremely guilty about this and told Kujo and Sano where she was. He idolizes Kujo just like how Mizuki idolizes Sano. He desperately wants to be more manly, and joined the Karate Club to become so; but he also admits to Mizuki that he really became attracted to karate because he saw Kujo practicing and thought he looked so beautiful. In the 2011 version of the drama, he is portrayed by Okayama Tomoki. Students of the Second Dormitory Classes that belong to this dormitory are 1-B, 2-C and 3-A. ; (drama CD) Mizuki Ashiya is the female protagonist of the series. She admired Izumi Sano the moment she saw him high jump on TV. She disguises herself as a boy in order to enroll herself into Sano's school, Osaka Gakuen which allows her to get closer with Sano. She loves sweet food and she is a very fast runner, initially causing all the three dorms in Osaka High to desperately recruit her. Mizuki falls in love with Sano, but is unable to tell him because she thinks that he doesn't know that she's a girl, though unbeknownst to her Sano knows her true gender and feels the same way about her. (It seems another reason she went there is because when she was going to watch him jump at that location, a gang of thugs tried to hurt her but Sano saved her. But when he tried to climb over a wired fence, one of them cut him with a knife on his heel.) She wants to be a dog trainer and is very close to Sano's dog, Yūjirō. She has an older half-brother named, who works as a doctor. He was portrayed by Yoshinori Okada in the Japanese drama adaptation, JJ Lin in the Taiwanese drama adaptation, and Julien Kang in the Korean adaptation. She was portrayed by Maki Horikita in the Japanese drama adaptation and Ella Chen in the Taiwanese drama adaptation. In the 2011 version of the drama, she is portrayed by Maeda Atsuko. In the Korean drama adaptation, To The Beautiful You, Mizuki is portrayed by Sulli Choi. ; * (drama CD) Izumi Sano is the male protagonist of the series. He hates all sweet things and is an excellent high jumper. Before entering high school, he stopped jumping for personal reasons. He found out Mizuki's true gender due to her clumsiness in an accident early in the series. He didn't tell anyone else about Mizuki being a girl and becomes protective of her because of this. Before Mizuki's arrival, Sano had been injured in an accident when he saved his team captain from being hit by a car, causing him to quit high jumping for a while because he thought that he couldn't handle the pressure. As the series goes on, Sano is aware of Mizuki's support for his jumping and starts to fall for her, but couldn't tell her because he feared that she would have to leave if she knew that he had found out her secret. He was portrayed by Shun Oguri in the Japanese drama adaptation and Wu Zun in the Taiwanese drama adaptation. In the 2011 version of the drama, he is portrayed by Nakamura Aoi. In the Korean drama adaptation, To The Beautiful You, Sano is portrayed by Choi Minho. ; * (drama CD) Nakatsu is one of the students living in the second dormitory.

In the last chapter, it is said that he became a model. He's also a former winner of the Miss Osaka pageant during his first year at Osaka, a fact which he isn't terribly proud of. His name is taken from Namba Station, located in Minami, a region in Chuo-ku, Ōsaka. He was portrayed by Hiro Mizushima in the Japanese drama adaptation and Danson Tang in the Taiwanese drama adaptation.

When he first comes to Osaka High, he was teased by others due to his ability to see spirits and auras. However, Nakatsu sees him as a good friend. His dream is to meditate on Mount Fuji though he really plans on going to college to study folklore after he graduates from Osaka High. Kayashima was aware of Mizuki's true gender since first meeting her (apparently, girls have pink auras). He didn't say anything because he believed that she had a good reason for pretending to be a boy. In volume 4, Nakajo noted that Kayashima took his name from the Kayashima Station, a railway station on the Keihan Main Line, located in Neyagawa-shi.

In the original Japanese drama he was portrayed by Kyo Nobuo and in the 2011 version of the drama, Himejima is portrayed by Hidenori Tokuyama. He is portrayed by Andy Gong in the Taiwanese version and Kim Ian in the Korean adaptation. The Umeda family ; Io is the eldest sister of the Umeda family as well to Rio and Hokuto. She is the mother of Minami Nanba. She discovers Mizuki's secret during the summer job that she offered to Mizuki, Sano and Nakatsu while she's changing out of her clothes and later provides Mizuki with more comfortable vests to cover up her developing body. She was portrayed by Yōko Moriguchi in the Japanese drama adaptation and Guo Chin Chun in the Taiwanese drama adaptation. ; * (drama CD) The doctor at the school's nurse office.

In the 2011 version of the drama, Umeda is portrayed by Takumi Saito. In the Korean adaptation, he is portrayed by Ki Tae Young. ; Rio is Hokuto's younger sister and is about the same age as Mizuki. She goes to St. Blossom High School. She doesn't like to admit the fact that she's Minami's aunt considering that he is two years older than she is, so she asks Mizuki to keep their relation a secret and instead say that they are cousins. She is quite picky about the men she wants to be with as she has grown up with a handsome father, brother and nephew. Rio was a friend of Julia's while she attended Saint Blossom as an exchange student. She was not present in the Japanese drama adaptation but Cai Han Cen portrayed her in the Taiwanese drama adaptation. ; Azuma is the father of Io, Hokuto and Rio as well being the grandfather of Minami.

Azuma attended the Christmas Dance with Seira where they won the best couple award. ; Seira is the mother to Io, Hokuto and Rio and grandmother to Minami. Like her husband Seira looks young even though she is fifty-one years old. She partnered with Azuma during the Christmas Dance party and won the best couple award with Azuma. It is implied that Io and Seira used to clash when Io was younger, making Seira cry on more than one occasion. Their friction subsided during the birth of Minami when Seira demanded that Io not give into the pain of childbirth, after which their relationship improved. Other supporting characters ; * (drama CD) He is a photographer and Hokuto's junior back during his days at Osaka Gakuen. Akiha likes to be around Umeda, something even Umeda doesn't appreciate. He is bisexual, once claiming that he loves all beautiful people regardless of gender. He was married to Ebi, his model and eventual make up artist, but they divorced because he kept her at arm's length, never letting her in and he had a \\"void\\" inside of him that, try as she might, she just couldn't fill. Ebi says that this may have been because he was abandoned by his mother when he was little, giving him severe trust issues. However she does state that they still love each other and are like brother and sister. This is proved later when instead of jumping to her defense, as Mizuki wanted to, when she is verbally abused by a model for accidentally sending off the outfits for the next shoot, Akiha trusts her and lets her handle it herself. He later says he did that because sometimes it's better to respect people and believe in them rather than trying to solve their problems for them. He, like Mizuki loves sweet things, even eating nothing but sweet red beans for breakfast on one of his shoots. His name is taken from Akihabara, one of the districts in Chiyoda, Tokyo. ; Izumi Sano's younger brother and a high jumper. He and Izumi were close when they were young. As Sano never contacted Shin after leaving the family, Shin felt forgotten and began to resent Izumi. He also used to be a delinquent for a while because of his older brother's leaving but they got into friendly terms again. He is actually not a bad kid, and really admires his older brother. He does not like onions. It is also implied that he may have some sort of feelings for Mizuki, since at the end of Chapter 106, he said that he would be back \\"after I gain my confidence and able to beat Brother\\" to tell her. What that is remains unknown, but Izumi feels a chill after Shin has said that. He is portrayed by Shunsuke Daito in the Japanese adaptation. ; He attends Tōkyō High School with Sano's younger brother, Shin. He is a high jumper and Sano's rival. He is always teasing Sano and Mizuki. He is portrayed by Yu Shirota in the Japanese adaptation and Ethan Juan in the Taiwanese drama.

She finds out that Sano knows that Mizuki's a girl and tried to trick Mizuki's classmates into thinking that she and Mizuki are lovers to gauge Sano's feelings for Mizuki. Nakatsu, jealous that Julia is close to Mizuki, takes a strong dislike in her and vice versa, calling him 'Monkey Boy'. It is hinted that she may have feelings for Nakatsu. She was portrayed by Minami Hinase in the Japanese drama adaptation and Nissa Marion in the Taiwanese drama adaptation. ; Mizuki's friend when she ran away from home and is also Mizuki's first love. Mizuki fainted from hunger so he took her home and gave her a place to stay. He was her first love and they almost kissed. As he was born with a hole in his lungs, he cannot do strenuous exercise or go to high altitudes. The operation to cure his birth defect was very risky and refused at the start but he did do the surgery after meeting Mizuki. After the surgery, he climbs the mountains he loves and later appears in Berkeley while Mizuki is visiting her family. He shows that he might have feelings for Mizuki. He is modeled after Leonardo DiCaprio.
