It existed between 1806 and 1918. It came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into different lines, which were unified in 1771. It then became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803‚Äì1806 and was a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871, remaining a Grand Duchy until 1918 when it became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden. Baden was bordered to the north by the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt; to the west, along most of its length, by the river Rhine, which separated Baden from the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate and Alsace in modern France; to the south by Switzerland; and to the east by the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Bavaria. After World War II, the French military government in 1945 created the state of Baden (originally known as \\"South Baden\\") out of the southern half of the former Baden, with Freiburg as its capital. This portion of the former Baden was declared in its 1947 constitution to be the true successor of the old Baden. The northern half of the old Baden was combined with northern W√ºrttemberg, becoming part of the American military zone, and formed the state of W√ºrttemberg-Baden. Both Baden and W√ºrttemberg-Baden became states of West Germany upon its formation in 1949. In 1952 Baden merged with W√ºrttemberg-Baden and W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern (southern W√ºrttemberg and the former Prussian exclave of Hohenzollern) to form Baden-W√ºrttemberg. This is the only merger of states that has taken place in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The unofficial anthem of Baden is called \\"Badnerlied\\" (Song of the People of Baden) and consists of four or five traditional verses. However, over the years, many more verses have been added ‚Äì there are collections with up to 591 verses of the anthem. Creation Baden came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into various smaller territories that were unified in 1771. In 1803 Baden was raised to Electoral dignity within the Holy Roman Empire. Upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Baden became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden. In 1815 it joined the German Confederation. During the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, Baden was a centre of revolutionist activities. In 1849, in the course of the Baden Revolution, it was the only German state that became a republic for a short while, under the leadership of Lorenzo Brentano. The revolution in Baden was suppressed mainly by Prussian troops. The Grand Duchy of Baden remained a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871. After the revolution of 1918, Baden became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden. French Revolution and Napoleon When the French Revolution threatened to overflow into the rest of Europe in 1792, Baden joined forces against France, and its countryside was devastated once more. In 1796, the margrave Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, was compelled to pay an indemnity and cede his territories on the left bank of the Rhine to France. Fortune, however, soon returned to his side. In 1803, largely owing to the good offices of Alexander I, emperor of Russia, he received the bishopric of Konstanz, part of the Rhenish Palatinate, and other smaller districts, together with the dignity of a prince-elector. Changing sides in 1805, he fought for Napoleon, with the result that, by the peace of Pressburg in that year, he obtained the Breisgau and other territories at the expense of the Habsburgs (see Further Austria). In 1806, he joined the Confederation of the Rhine, declared himself a sovereign prince, became a grand duke, and received additional territory. The Baden contingent continued to assist France, and by the Peace of Vienna in 1809, the grand duke was rewarded with accessions of territory at the expense of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Having quadrupled the area of Baden, Charles Frederick died in June 1811, and was succeeded by his grandson, Charles, Grand Duke of Baden, who was married to St√©phanie de Beauharnais (1789‚Äì1860), a cousin of Empress Josephine's first husband who had been adopted by Napoleon I. Charles fought for his father-in-law until after the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, when he joined the Allies. Baden in the German Confederation Monument to the Constitution of Baden (and the Grand Duke for granting it), in Rondellplatz, Karlsruhe, Germany In 1815 Baden became a member of the German Confederation established by the Act of 8 June, annexed to the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna of 9 June. However, in the haste of winding up the Congress, the question of the succession to the grand duchy did not get settled, a matter that would soon become acute. The treaty of 16 April 1816, by which the territorial disputes between Austria and Bavaria were settled, guaranteed the succession of the Baden Palatinate to King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, upon the expected event of the extinction of the line of Z√§hringen. As a counter to this, in 1817, the Grand Duke Charles issued a pragmatic sanction (Hausgesetz) declaring the counts of Hochberg, the issue of a morganatic marriage between the grand-duke Charles Frederick and Luise Geyer von Geyersberg (created countess Hochberg), capable of succeeding to the crown. A controversy between Bavaria and Baden ensued, which was only decided in favour of the Hochberg claims by a treaty signed by Baden and the four great powers at Frankfurt on 10 July 1819. Meanwhile, the dispute had wide-ranging effects. In order to secure popular support for the Hochberg heir, in 1818 Grand Duke Charles granted to the grand duchy, under Article XIII of the Act of Confederation, a liberal constitution, under which two chambers were constituted and their assent declared necessary for legislation and taxation. The outcome was important far beyond the narrow limits of the duchy, as all of Germany watched the constitutional experiments in the southern states. In Baden, the conditions were not favourable for success. During the revolutionary period, the people had fallen completely under the influence of French ideas, and this was sufficiently illustrated by the temper of the new chambers, which tended to model their activity on the proceedings of the National Convention (1792‚Äì1795) in the earlier days of the French Revolution. Additionally, the new Grand Duke Louis I (ruled 1818‚Äì1830), who had succeeded in 1818, was unpopular, and the administration was in the hands of hide-bound and inefficient bureaucrats. The result was a deadlock. Even before the promulgation of the Carlsbad Decrees in October 1819, the Grand Duke had prorogued the chambers after three months of unproductive debate. The reaction that followed was as severe in Baden as elsewhere in Germany, and culminated in 1823 when, on the refusal of the chambers to vote on the military budget, the Grand Duke dissolved them and levied the taxes on his own authority. In January 1825, owing to official pressure, only three Liberals were returned to the chamber. A law was passed making the budget presentable only every three years, and the constitution ceased to have any active existence. In 1830 Grand Duke Louis was succeeded by his half-brother Grand Duke Leopold (ruled 1830‚Äì1852), the first of the H√∂chberg line. The July Revolution (1830) in France did not cause any disturbances in Baden, but the new Grand Duke showed liberal tendencies from the beginning. The elections of 1830 proceeded without interference, and resulted in the return of a Liberal majority. The next few years saw the introduction, under successive ministries, of Liberal reforms in the constitution, in criminal and civil law, and in education. In 1832, the adhesion of Baden to the Prussian Zollverein did much for the material prosperity of the country. 1849 Baden Revolution By 1847, radicalism once more began to raise its head in Baden. On 12 September 1847, a popular demonstration held at Offenburg passed resolutions demanding the conversion of the regular army into a national militia, which should take an oath to the constitution, as well as a progressive income tax, and a fair adjustment of the interests of capital and labour. The news of the revolution of February 1848 in Paris brought agitation to a head. Numerous public meetings were held and the Offenburg programme was adopted. On 4 March 1848, under the influence of popular excitement, the lower chamber accepted this programme almost unanimously. As in other German states, the government bowed to the storm, proclaimed an amnesty and promised reforms. The ministry remodelled itself in a more Liberal direction, and sent a new delegate to the federal diet at Frankfurt, empowered to vote for the establishment of a parliament for a united Germany. Disorder, fomented by republican agitators, continued nonetheless. The efforts of the government to suppress the agitators with the aid of federal troops led to an armed insurrection, which was mastered without much difficulty. The uprising, led by Friedrich Hecker and Franz Joseph Trefzger, was lost at Kandern on 20 April 1848. Freiburg, which they held, fell on 24 April and, on 27 April, a Franco‚ÄìGerman legion, which had invaded Baden from Strasbourg, was routed at Dossenbach. In the beginning of 1849, however, the issue of a new constitution in accordance with the resolutions of the Frankfurt parliament, led to more serious trouble. It did little to satisfy the radicals, angered by the refusal of the second chamber to agree to their proposal for the summoning of a constituent assembly on 10 February, 1849. The new insurrection that broke out proved a more formidable affair than the first. A military mutiny at Rastatt on 11 May showed that the army sympathised with the revolution, which was proclaimed two days later at Offenburg amid tumultuous scenes. Also, on 13 May a mutiny at Karlsruhe forced Grand Duke Leopold to flee, and the next day his ministers followed. Meanwhile, a committee of the diet under Lorenz Brentano (1813‚Äì1891), who represented the more moderate radicals against the republicans, established itself in the capital in an attempt to direct affairs pending the establishment of a provisional government. This was accomplished on 1 June and, on 10 June, the constituent diet, consisting entirely of the most \\"advanced\\" politicians, assembled. It had little chance of doing more than make speeches. The country remained in the hands of an armed mob of civilians and mutinous soldiers. Meanwhile, the Grand Duke of Baden had joined with Bavaria in requesting the armed intervention of Prussia, which Berlin granted on the condition that Baden would join the Alliance of the Three Kings. From this moment, the revolution in Baden was doomed, and with it the revolution across Germany. The Prussians, under Prince William (afterwards William I, German Emperor), invaded Baden in the middle of June 1849. Afraid of a military escalation, Brentano reacted hesitantly ‚Äì too hesitantly for the more radical Gustav Struve and his followers, who overthrew him and established a Pole, Ludwig Mieroslawski (1814‚Äì1878), in his place. Mieroslawski reduced the insurgents to some semblance of order. On 20 June, 1849, he met the Prussians at Waghausel, and suffered complete defeat. On 25 June, Prince William entered Karlsruhe and, at the end of the month, the members of the provisional government, who had taken refuge at Freiburg, dispersed. The insurgent leaders who were caught, notably the ex-officers, suffered military execution. The army was dispersed among Prussian garrison towns, and Prussian troops occupied Baden for a time. Franz Trefzger managed to escape to Switzerland. Grand Duke Leopold returned on 10 August and at once dissolved the diet. The following elections resulted in a majority favourable to the new ministry, which passed a series of laws of a reactionary tendency with a view to strengthening the government. 1850‚Äì1866 Grand Duke Leopold died on 24 April 1852 and was succeeded by his second son, Frederick, as regent, since the eldest, Louis II, Grand Duke of Baden (died 22 January 1858), was incapable of ruling. The internal affairs of Baden during the period that followed have little general interest. In the greater politics of Germany, Baden between 1850 and 1866 was a consistent supporter of Austria. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Austria's contingents, under Prince William, had two sharp engagements with the Prussian army of the Main. However, on 24 July 1866, two days before the Battle of Werbach, the second chamber petitioned the Grand Duke to end the war and enter into an offensive and defensive alliance with Prussia. Towards the German Empire Grand Duke Frederick I (ruled 1856‚Äì1907) opposed the war with Prussia from the first, but yielded to popular resentment at the policy of Prussia on the Schleswig-Holstein question. The ministry, as one, resigned. Baden announced her withdrawal from the German Confederation and, on 17 August 1866, signed a treaty of peace and alliance with Prussia. Bismarck himself resisted the adhesion of Baden to the North German Confederation. He had no wish to give Napoleon III of France a good excuse for intervention, but the opposition of Baden to the formation of a South German confederation made the union inevitable. The troops of Baden took a conspicuous share in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870, and it was Grand Duke Frederick of Baden, who, in the historic assembly of the German princes at Versailles, was the first to hail the king of Prussia as German emperor. Kulturkampf The internal politics of Baden, both before and after 1870, centered in the main around the question of religion. The signing on 28 June 1859 of a concordat with the Holy See, which placed education under the oversight of the clergy and facilitated the establishment of religious institutes, led to a constitutional struggle. This struggle ended in 1863 with the victory of secular principles, making the communes responsible for education, though admitting the priests to a share in the management. The quarrel between secularism and Catholicism, however, did not end. In 1867, on the accession to the premiership of Julius von Jolly (1823‚Äì1891), several constitutional changes in a secular direction occurred: responsibility of ministers, freedom of the press, and compulsory education. On 6 September 1867, a law compelled all candidates for the priesthood to pass government examinations. The archbishop of Freiburg resisted, and, on his death in April 1868, the see remained vacant. In 1869, the introduction of civil marriage did not allay the strife, which reached its climax after the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility in 1870. The Kulturkampf raged in Baden, as in the rest of Germany, and, here as elsewhere, the government encouraged the formation of Old Catholic communities. Not until 1880, after the fall of the ministry of Jolly, did Baden reconcile with Rome. In 1882 the archbishopric of Freiburg was again filled. Baden in the German Empire The political tendency of Baden, meanwhile, mirrored that of all Germany. In 1892 the National Liberals had but a majority of one in the diet. From 1893, they could stay in power only with the aid of the Conservatives and, in 1897, a coalition of the Catholic Centre Party, Socialists, Social Democrats and Radicals (Freisinnige) won a majority for the opposition in the chamber. Amid all these contests, the statesmanlike moderation of the Grand Duke Frederick won him universal esteem. By the treaty under which Baden had become an integral part of the German Empire in 1871, he had reserved only the exclusive right to tax beer and spirits. The army, the post-office, railways and the conduct of foreign relations passed to the effective control of Prussia. In his relations with the German Empire, too, Frederick proved himself more of a great German noble than a sovereign prince actuated by particularist ambitions. His position as husband of the emperor William I's only daughter, Louise (whom he had married in 1856), gave him a peculiar influence in the councils of Berlin. When, on 20 September 1906, the Grand Duke celebrated at once the jubilee of his reign and his golden wedding anniversary, all Europe honoured him. King Edward VII appointed him, by the hands of the Duke of Connaught, a Knight of the Order of the Garter. But more significant, perhaps, was the tribute paid by Le Temps, the leading Parisian paper: > Nothing more clearly demonstrates the sterile paradox of the Napoleonic work > than the history of the Grand Duchy. It was Napoleon, and he alone, who > created this whole state in 1803 to reward in the person of the little > margrave of Baden a relative of the emperor of Russia.

But French opinion itself renders justice to the > probity of his character and to the ardour of his patriotism, and nobody > will feel surprise at the homage with which Germany feels bound to surround > his old age. Grand Duke Frederick I died at Mainau on 28 September 1907. He was succeeded by his son, the Grand Duke Frederick II (ruled 1907‚Äì1918, died 1928). Constitution and Government The Grand Duchy of Baden was a hereditary monarchy with executive power vested in the Grand Duke; legislative authority was shared between him and a representative assembly (Landtag) consisting of two chambers. The upper chamber included all the princes of the ruling family of full age, the heads of all the mediatized families, the Archbishop of Freiburg, the president of the Protestant Evangelical Church of Baden, a deputy from each of the universities and the technical high school, eight members elected by the territorial nobility for four years, three representatives elected by the chamber of commerce, two by that of agriculture, one by the trades, two mayors of municipalities, and eight members (two of them legal functionaries) nominated by the Grand Duke. The lower chamber consisted of 73 popular representatives, of whom 24 were elected by the burgesses of certain communities, and 49 by rural communities. Every citizen of 25 years of age, who had not been convicted and was not a pauper, had a vote. The elections were, however, indirect. The citizens selected the Wahlm√§nner (deputy electors), the latter selecting the representatives. The chambers met at least every two years. The lower chambers were elected for four years, half the members retiring every two years. The executive consisted of four departments: the interior, foreign and grand-ducal affairs; finance; justice; and ecclesiastical affairs and education. The chief sources of revenue were direct and indirect taxes, the railways and domains. The railways were operated by the state, and formed the only source of major public debt, about 22 million pounds sterling. The supreme courts lay in Karlsruhe, Freiburg, Offenburg, Heidelberg, Mosbach, Waldshut, Konstanz, and Mannheim, from which appeals passed to the Reichsgericht (the supreme tribunal) in Leipzig. Population At the beginning of the 19th century, Baden was a margraviate, with an area of barely 1,300 sq mi (3,400 km¬≤) and a population of 210,000. Subsequently, the grand duchy acquired more territory so that, by 1905, it had 5,823 sq mi (15,082 km¬≤) and a population of 2,010,728. Of that number, 61% were Roman Catholics, 37% Protestants, 1.5% Jews, and the remainder of other religions. At that time, about half of the population was rural, living in communities of less than 2,000; the density of the rest was about . The country was divided into the following districts: *Mannheim district had the towns Mannheim, and Heidelberg *Karlsruhe district included Karlsruhe and Pforzheim *Freiburg im Breisgau district included Freiburg *Konstanz district had Konstanz The capital of the duchy was Karlsruhe, and important towns other than those listed included Rastatt, Baden-Baden, Bruchsal, Lahr and Offenburg. The population was most thickly clustered in the north and near the Swiss city of Basel. The inhabitants of Baden are of various origins, those to the south of Murg being descended from the Alemanni and those to the north from the Franks, while the Swabian Plateau derives its name from the adjacent German tribe (Schwaben), who lived in W√ºrttemberg. Geography thumbBaden from 1819 to 1945: \\\\---- \\\\---- The Grand Duchy had an area of and consisted of a considerable portion of the eastern half of the fertile valley of the Rhine and of the mountains which form its boundary. The mountainous part was by far the most extensive, forming nearly 80% of the whole area. From Lake Constance in the south to the river Neckar in the north is a portion of the Black Forest (), which is divided by the valley of the Kinzig into two districts of different elevation. To the south of the Kinzig the mean height is ), and the highest summit, the Feldberg, reaches about , while to the north the mean height is only , and the Hornisgrinde, the culminating point of the whole, does not exceed . To the north of the Neckar is the Odenwald Range, with a mean of , and in the Katzenbuckel, an extreme of . Lying between the Rhine and the Dreisam is the Kaiserstuhl, an independent volcanic group, nearly 16 km in length and 8 km in breadth, the highest point of which is . The greater part of Baden belongs to the basin of the Rhine, which receives upwards of twenty tributaries from the highlands; the north- eastern portion of the territory is also watered by the Main and the Neckar. A part, however, of the eastern slope of the Black Forest belongs to the basin of the Danube, which there takes its rise in a number of mountain streams. Among the numerous lakes which belonged to the duchy are the Mummelsee, Wildersee, Eichenersee and Schluchsee, but none of them is of any significant size. Lake Constance (Bodensee) belongs partly to the German federal states (L√§nder) of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria, and partly to Austria and Switzerland. Owing to its physical configuration, Baden presents great extremes of heat and cold. The Rhine valley is the warmest district in Germany, but the higher elevations of the Black Forest record the greatest degrees of cold experienced in the South. The mean temperature of the Rhine valley is approximately and that of the high table-land . July is the hottest month and January the coldest. The mineral wealth of Baden was not great, but iron, coal, lead and zinc of excellent quality were produced; silver, copper, gold, cobalt, vitriol and sulfur were obtained in small quantities. Peat was found in abundance, as well as gypsum, china clay, potter's earth and salt. The mineral springs of Baden are still very numerous and have acquired great celebrity, those of Baden-Baden, Badenweiler, Antogast, Griesbach, Friersbach and Peterthal being the most frequented. In the valleys the soil is particularly fertile, yielding luxuriant crops of wheat, maize, barley, spelt, rye, beans, potatoes, flax, hemp, hops, beetroot and tobacco; and even in the more mountainous part, rye, wheat and oats are extensively cultivated. There is a considerable extent of pasture-land, and the rearing of cattle, sheep, pigs and goats is extensively practised. Of game, deer, boar, snipe and wild partridges are fairly abundant, while the mountain streams yield trout of excellent quality. Viticulture is increasing, and the wines continue to sell well. The Baden wine region is Germany's third largest in terms of vineyard surface. The gardens and the orchards supply an abundance of fruit, especially sweet cherries, plums, apples and walnuts, and bee-keeping is practised throughout the country. A greater proportion of Baden than any other south German state is occupied by forests. In these, the predominant trees are European beech and silver fir, but many others, such as sweet chestnut, Scots pine, Norway spruce and the exotic coast Douglas-fir, are well represented. A third, at least, of the annual timber production is exported. Industries Around 1910, 56.8% of the region's land mass was cultivated and 38% was forested. Before 1870, the agricultural sector was responsible for the bulk of the grand duchy's wealth, but this was superseded by industrial production. The chief products were machinery, woollen and cotton goods, silk ribbons, paper, tobacco, china, leather, glass, clocks, jewellery, and chemicals. Beet sugar was also manufactured on a large scale, as were wooden ornaments and toys, music boxes and organs. The exports of Baden consisted mostly of the above goods and were considerable, but the bulk of its trade consisted of transit. The grand duchy had many railways and roads, as well as the Rhine for transporting goods by ship. Railways were run by the state as the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway (Gro√üherzoglich Badische Staatseisenbahnen). A rail- line ran mostly parallel with the Rhine, with oblique branches from East to West. Mannheim was the great market centre for exports down the Rhine and had substantial river traffic. It was also the chief manufacturing town for the duchy and an important administrative centre for its northern region. Education and religion There were numerous educational institutions in Baden. There were three universities, one Protestant in Heidelberg, one Roman Catholic in Freiburg im Breisgau, and a research university in Karlsruhe. The grand-duke was a Protestant; under him, the Evangelical Church was governed by a nominated council and a synod consisting of a prelate, 48 elected and 7 nominated lay and clerical members. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Freiburg is Metropolitan of the Upper Rhine.

The case also considers the constitutional status of the Supreme Court, holding that the Court has been constitutionally entrenched by the Constitution Act, 1982, and that the composition of the Court, including eligibility for appointment, can only be amended by unanimous consent of the House of Commons, Senate and all provincial legislative assemblies.Constitution Act, 1982, s. 41(d); Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. Background The case arose when the federal government appointed Justice Marc Nadon to the position of puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, on October 3, 2013. At the time of the appointment, Justice Nadon was a supernumerary judge of the Federal Court of Appeal, having served on the federal courts for over 20 years. Justice Nadon had been a member of the Quebec Bar prior to his appointment. Ontario lawyer Rocco Galati challenged the appointment in the Federal Court of Canada, arguing that Justice Nadon was not eligible to be appointed, as he was neither a member of one of the superior courts of Quebec, nor a current member of the Bar of Quebec. The Quebec government also questioned the appointment. In response, the federal Parliament passed an amendment to the Supreme Court Act, which declared that the requirement that an appointee be a member of the Quebec bar also included former members of the Bar.Supreme Court Act, ss. 5.1, 6.1, as enacted by the Economic Action Plan 2013 Act, No. 2, SC 2013, c. 40, ss. 471, 472. The federal government then referred the issue to the Supreme Court as a reference question under the Supreme Court Act.Supreme Court Act, s. 53. The federal government argued that the requirement that Quebec judges be appointed from among the bar of Quebec included former members of the bar. The Supreme Court Act and the Quebec Seats on the Court When the Supreme Court was created in 1875, it was composed of six judges, two of whom were required to be appointed from the superior courts of Quebec or from the Bar of Quebec,Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, SC 1875, c. 11, s. 4. in order to ensure representation of Quebec's civil law jurisdiction on the Court. When the Court was expanded to nine judges in 1949, the number of Quebec judges was increased to three.Act to amend the Supreme Court Act, SC 1949 (2nd Sess.), c. 37, ss. 1, 3. This provision continues to apply under the Supreme Court Act.Supreme Court Act, s. 6. Section 5 of the Act holds that, in general, Court appointees must either have been members of a provincial superior court, or must have at least ten years' standing at a provincial bar. Section 6 then provides a particular rule for Quebec, requiring that the three judges from Quebec must be appointed from either the superior courts of Quebec, or \\"among the advocates of that province.\\" The general rule in section 5 clearly included former members of the bars of the provinces as eligible to be appointed. The issue was whether the wording of section 6 restricted that general rule to current members of the bar of Quebec for the Quebec seats on the Court. Decision of the Court The Supreme Court ruled, by a 6‚Äì1 decision, that only current members of the Quebec superior courts and current members of the bar of Quebec are eligible to be appointed to the Quebec seats on the Supreme Court. =Majority decision= The majority decision was attributed to all six of the judges in the majority, rather than to a single judge. The Court held that the amendment to the Supreme Court Act was not simply declaratory of the previous law but an actual change to the composition of the Court, and was therefore federal Parliament. A change to the composition of the Court can only be made by a unanimous constitutional amendment under s. 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The appointment of Justice Nadon was therefore void . He remained a supernumerary judge of the Federal Court of Appeal. =Dissent by Justice Moldaver= Justice Moldaver dissented. He argued that section 5 and section 6 of the Supreme Court Act had to be read together, and that the requirement in section 6 that Quebec appointees be from \\"among the advocates of that province\\" included former members of the Quebec bar, the same as for appointments from the other provinces under section 5. =Recusal by Justice Rothstein= Justice Rothstein did not participate in the decision. He had been appointed from the Federal Court of Appeal, leading to the possibility that his right to be appointed might be called into question. However, since he had previously been a member of the bar of Manitoba, the decision did not leave his appointment in doubt, since he qualified under the general appointee principle set out in section 5 of the Supreme Court Act.

History Colwyn Trevarthen, a Professor at Edinburgh University, studied successful interactions between infants and their primary care givers, and found that the mother's responsiveness to her baby's initiatives supported and developed intersubjectivity (shared understanding), which he regarded as the basis of all effective communication, interaction and learning. In the 1980s Harry Biemans, in the Netherlands, applied this research using video clips, creating Video Interaction Guidance (VIG).http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=D2945365261E84DE32B60B39E9CE56D4?doi=10.1.1.125.4375&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf VIG is used in more than 15 countries and by at least 4000 practitioners. More recently other video feedback interventions have been developed, including Video Enhanced Reflective Practice (VERP), a particular application of VIG.http://www.verp.uk.com/VERP.phphttp://www.slideshare.net/IRISSslides/verp- project-with-newly-qualified-social-workers In 2008, the current version of the Video-feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) was finalized by Femmie Juffer, Marian Bakermans- Kranenburg, and Marinus van IJzendoorn of the Centre for Child and Family Studies at Leiden University. Research results and analysis Research results include that video feedback interactions enhances positive parenting skills, decreases/alleviates parental stress and is related to more positive development of the children.http://www.patcrittenden.com/include/infancy_attachment.htm Analysis of why video feedback interventions are effective includes that the use of video clips enables a shared space to be created, where positive sensitivity and attunement moments can be seen. This allows clients to improve their relationship attunement skills, by developing their ability to mentalise about their own and their infants mental states, and by encouraging mind-minded interactions.http://videonet.fi/mll/20130315/2/kennedy.pdf (Trevarthen focuses particularly on how babies seek companionship, rather than using the term attachment, and has said \\"I think the ideal companion... is a familiar person who really treats the baby with playful human respect.\\"http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/video/p/video_tcm4637506.asp) Video Interaction Guidance, one example of video feedback interaction, has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2‚Äì12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan. Am evaluation of the project demonstrated that VIG produced a significant change in the emotional and behavioural difficulties of the population of children who received the service, and improvement in reported level of parenting and reported parental relationship with their children in the population of parents whose children received the service. The data excludes to parents who failed to complete the programme, parents who completed the programme but decided not to complete evaluation measures, and on some measures parents who completed measures but whose feedback was adjudged to have been positively biased.  Understanding the mechanisms through which Video Feedback Interaction works  Qualitative research studies have also illuminated some of the ways in which Video Feedback Interaction can help individual parents. = Attachment theory in action = Video feedback interventions, particularly VIPP-SD, have been created based on the attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby (1969) and Mary Ainsworth (1974). This theory suggests that an infant seeks comfort and protection from caregivers, and through their experiences they learn to seek this comfort selectively from caregivers they can rely on. Their behaviors with these caregivers depend on the infant's internal working models of these relationships. Bowlby explained in his writing of attachment theory that an infant should have an intimate, warm relationship with his caregiver in which they both find enjoyment The interventions seek to create positive interactions between the child and caregiver, in order to change the child's internal working models of these relationships, leading to a change in the child's behavior. = Social learning theory in action = Evaluations have demonstrated that in certain cases parents have learned to improve their parenting in the way described by social learning theory. Social Learning Theory suggests people learn by observing positive desired outcomes resulting from the observed behaviour.Churchill, G. (2015) Safecare: Evidence from a Home Based Parenting Programme for Neglect, London, NSPCC. https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/safecare- evidence-evaluation-report.pdf Parents, with several children, who traditionally spent all their time with the children with the children together in the group, started spending one-to-one time with individual children, after having been required by Video Interaction Guidance, to do one- on-one activities with a particular child, for the first time. Some parents started to do activities with their children, which involved a small element of risk, after having agreed to do them for the first time as part of Video Interaction Guidance. Similar findings are reported in an evaluation of the Triple P intervention.Whalley, P. (2015) Child neglect and Pathways Triple P: An Evaluation of an NSPCC services offered to parents where initial concerns of neglect have been noted, https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/pathways- triple-p-evaluation-report.pdf = The importance of the relationship between the practitioner and the parent = A principal factor which influences parents' engagement and perception is the quality of the relationship that they are able to build up with the practitioner delivering the programme. Key factors in helping practitioners engage parents into the intervention include: * Establishing a sense that the practitioner will support the family beyond what is necessary to complete the intervention. * Giving family members time to talk about their problems both during and out of appointments. * Advocating for the family on issues with which the intervention is not directly concerned. * Ensuring that fun forms a part of the interaction. * Making family members feel cared for through the provision of clothes, food and gifts. * Giving parents a lead in analysing family functioning and parenting. * Carrying out the intervention in the home of the parent. * Practitioners working on weekday evenings. In the case of Video Interaction Guidance, when parents were asked about their experience of the intervention, parents invariably referred to the care and support provided by the practitioner. Effectively the intervention is experienced as an aspect of the overall relationship of care.

Babulal Vakharia, his 75-year-old son, is the opposite, and believes that he is now too old to enjoy life, and detests how his father acts. Dhiru is an employee at a medical shop who delivers medicine to the Vakharias. Dhiru likes Dattatraya for his attitude and is scared of Babulal because of his grumpy nature. Dattatraya seeks to break the record of the oldest living person. and thus he seeks to avoid negative people. Therefore, he threatens to send his son to an elderly care facility unless he achieves certain conditions. While Babulal is hesitant, he accepts with Dhiru as a witness. Firstly, Babulal writes a love letter to his deceased wife. Next, he accuses his doctor of being a thief so that he stops going to the clinic daily for a checkup. While rejecting to cut holes in his childhood blanket, Babulal visits a playground and a church that remind him of childhood memories. He becomes sorrowed and distributes cake to young children in the streets with his father. Babulal begins to appreciate his father's outlook on life. However, Babulal receives a call from his estranged son Amol informing Babulal that he will visit India. While Babulal is ecstatic hearing the news, Dattatraya is certain that Amol's motive is to claim their property as their heir. So he gives Babu his last task: to kick Amol out of the house for all his negligence towards his family. They argue and Babulal stops talking to Dattatraya. Even Dhiru, for the first time, supports Babulal and feels that Amol should be given a chance. Dattatraya reveals that Babu had spent all his savings to educate Amol and send him to the United States. However, Amol ignored them, telling nothing about his new family life in America. Dattatraya also tells his son he has cancer, living happily so that Babulal can live like him. Days later, Amol arrives in India, where Babulal humiliates him in public, calling him to return home. After later celebrating with Dattatraya and Dhiru, Dattatraya passes away at 102 years of age.

Rajeev Masand of News18 gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 saying that, \\"Despite its many shortcomings 102 Not Out has its heart in the right place, and a pair of actors clearly enjoying themselves on screen. Their infectious energy alone makes this film worth a watch.\\" Rachit Gupta of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 saying that, \\"The unique and refreshing concept of 102 Not Out is its strength. It's just a happy and healthy entertainer that tells you that living in the moment and making the most of everyday of your life is all that matters.\\" Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 saying that, \\"No doubt it's great to see a film about two old people. But we have seen both Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor in that avatar in better films (Piku especially, and in Kapoor & Sons) before this.\\" Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that, \\"102 Not Out's heart is firmly in the right place. The film knows its territory and the emotions it wants to evoke. It's just that a few important characters don't get enough play and they are sacrificed to make space to Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor.\\" Raja Sen of NDTV gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 saying that, \\"Shukla's film is a sweet but dull enterprise, one that never quite rises above its ultimate ambition: that of having two legendary actors play off each other.\\" Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 saying that, \\"The Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor starrer film is a heart warming experience of celebrating life as it comes.\\" Namrata Joshi of The Hindu reviewed the film saying that, \\"Umesh Shukla's film is unable to leave its inherent theatricality behind.

Instead, by subscription, the University of Fashion provides video lessons to those who can't afford or who can't access a traditional fashion school or who want to supplement the learning they're currently receiving from a fashion school.  Background  Sterlacci felt that fashion design was declining in the US due to companies moving off-shore and she wanted to promote fashion design education. She got the idea of launching University of Fashion while teaching at Fashion Institute of Technology and the Academy of Art University and felt that students \\"didn't want to rely on books; they wanted videos.\\" In 2013, she launched the website. Prior to starting the website, Sterlacci was a professor and chair at the Fashion Institute of Technology and taught graduate level fashion design at the Academy of Art University. As of the end of 2015, Sterlacci had filmed over 300 video lessons for the website.  Website  The website is owned and operated by Francesca Sterlacci and Jeffrey Purvin, who funded the venture privately. The University of Fashion provides monthly and/or yearly subscriptions to individuals, fashion schools, libraries, sewing clubs, fashion businesses and retailers. The website features video lessons on draping, patternmaking, sewing, fashion art, knits, childrenswear, CAD, fashion business, product development, trend forecasting and colour theory. All lessons are subdivided by the difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. The site's lessons feature professors from Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons The New School for Design as well as other educational institutes, or industry professionals. Aside from its how-to video lessons, the University of Fashion website also provides a fashion terminology dictionary, fashion design tools and supplies, lists of recommended fashion schools, museums, magazines, websites and blogs, as well as tours of fashion museums and features on other fashion venues.

The district encompasses 250 contributing buildings in the communities of Welsh Neck, Long Bluff, and Society Hill. The Welsh Neck community was an early religious center (a ca. 1738 Baptist church was established here) for the Pee Dee region, and Long Bluff served as a judicial center. The courthouse at Long Bluff, with its jail, tavern, and supporting buildings, was a center of activity for the Upper Pee Dee region during the Revolution. Few small communities have contributed more to the public in the way of culture, education and leadership than has Society Hill. It has numbered among its population outstanding leaders in religion and education, jurists, statesmen, soldiers, authors, and agriculturists. The Society Hill Library Society was formed in 1822. This group grew out of the St. David's Society, founded 1777 in Cheraw, which had a widespread influence and was a main factor in making Society Hill a center of intelligent leadership in the Pee Dee for a century and a half. and Accompanying map This is a rural community with many fine antebellum homes in the Georgian mode. Constructed on large lots or in wooden settings, many are two-storied clapboard structures with one-story front verandahs.

It can be used via the Web UI, or other clients via the API.  Federation  As a distributed social network, Pump.io is not tied to a single site. Users across servers can subscribe to each other, and if one or more individual nodes go offline the rest of the network remains intact.

In the 1990s he organized an all-female main room line up for a gig called Adrenalene. He described the gig as, \\"Sexy party, sexy girls! For some reason DJing had become a male dominated arena and I believe this is more to do with ignorance and not talent. At the time there were sooo many good female DJs so I thought I would showcase them and let the people decide. Chicks dance, chicks know music and chicks can mix!\\". In 1997-'98 he created the girl group Screw and then renamed them the Rocket Girls. Edwin wrote and produced their music, and the group played at local dance parties.

It was last assigned to V Fighter Command, and was inactivated on 31 May 1946 at Itami Airfield, Japan. The squadron was a World War II Air Commando unit, primarily seeing combat during the Philippines Campaign (1944‚Äì45) with the 3d Air Commando Group. Flying unarmed Stinson L-5 Grasshopper and UC-64A Norseman light aircraft, the squadron flew courier and aerial reconnaissance missions and dropped munitions and supplies to American and Philippine forces fighting in the Battle of Luzon. History =Origins and training= The unit was activated on 1 March 1944 at Cox Field, Paris, Texas under Second Air Force. after a brief time for organization, the squadron was moved to Pounds Field, near Tyler, Texas. Upon arrival, the squadron was composed of 109 enlisted and 12 officer personnel. At Pounds, the squadron was equipped with the Stinson L-5 Sentinel, single engine light observation aircraft and on 1 May it was designated as a Commando squadron, being assigned to the 3d Air Commando Group. AFHRA History of the 159th Liaison Squadron (7 volumes) After a period of training, the squadron was reassigned to Statesboro Army Airfield on 1 June where it joined with the 157th and 160th Liaison Squadrons which had been organized at Brownwood Army Air Field, Texas. There it found the 341st Airdrome Squadron, which would serve as the service organization for all of the Liaison Squadrons. The first part of the month of June was spent in setting up the squadron at its new location. Thirty-two L-5 and three UC-64A aircraft were available for flying during the month. Emphasis was continually placed upon short field landings, minimum altitude cross-country flights and formation flying. Training was brought up to date in camouflage, medical subjects and intelligence. Classes in code, blinker, the actual reading of panels from the air, and first aid continued during the month, increasing the proficiency of the pilots in these subjects. Excerpted from WWII Air Commandos, Volume II (1994) and from Official History of the 159th Liaison Squadron Commando The mission of the Liaison Squadrons was to deploy to the Philippine Islands and to provide battlefield observation and liaison flights, supporting to ground combat units and deliver supplies and munitions to them either by parachute drops or to land on unimproved fields and roads. By the beginning of October 1944, the squadrons were judged ready to deploy. From Statesboro Army Air Field, Georgia the Squadron moved to Cross City AAB. Florida. In October they transferred to Drew Field, Tampa Florida for final preparations. After several weeks, the squadrons began leaving by train on 24 October, heading for Camp Stoneman, Oakland California where the men were issued tropical uniforms, attending more classes and lectures, getting shots and filling out an endless number of forms. On 6 November, the men boarded ferries to board the USS General M. L. Hersey, their transport to the war zone in the Southwest Pacific. A brief stop was made at Guadacanal, which had become a major logistics base, then they proceeded to Finschafen and Hollandia on New Guinea. On 26 November the ship departed for Leyte, where it arrived on 30 November near the village of Palo. =Leyte= Upon arrival, it was found that the squadron was not expected, and there was no place for the men to be quartered. Pup tents were issued and they were directed to find a place to bivouack. At the same time, a period of rain began and the tents began to sink into the muddy ground. It took three days before they were able to move to a beach encampment near San Roque. Also cots arrived which enabled the men to stay above the water which ran through the tents constantly. After a few days at the arrival camp, the squadrons began to move to a new airfield in the vicinity of Tanauan. It was there that the squadrons were given their assignments to V Fighter Command, and then to the 86th Fighter Wing. The airfield, however, required much construction to turn it into a functional facility and most of December was involved in construction activities. While waiting for the arrival of their planes, the men of the squadrons used a single bulldozer and their hands to work on the airfield, giving it the name \\"Mitchell Field\\", after 2d Lieutenant William Mitchell, who led the construction effort. Also the squadron was able to borrow a few L-5s from the 25th Liaison Squadron to fly proficiency flights. =Battle of Luzon= On 9 January 1945, two Corps of the Sixth United States Army landed on the shores of Lingayen Gulf, just a few miles south of where the Japanese had invaded the island on 22 December 1941. From the landing beaches, the Corps drove south to the Manila area while maintaining a strong defensive line to the North. In this liberated beachhead, two major airfields plus smaller liaison landing strips were hastily constructed. With the landings on Luzon, the members of the three 3d Commando Group's Liaison Squadrons gathered their equipment and supplies and loaded onto LST 919 for the trip to the Lingayen beachhead. Upon arrival, the units moved by truck convoy on 1 February to a rough airstrip near Calaiso, where some landing strips, carved out by the men of the 168th Field Artillery Regiment, were being used by an L-5 Stinson for artillery spotting. While moving to Luzon, back on Leyte, some new L-5Bs had arrived in crates and a detachment of the squadron had remained to assemble the aircraft. After assembling the aircraft, making some test flights, and configuring some bomb shackles for the carrying and dropping of supplies, some auxiliary gas tanks were installed in the rear of the cockpit to increase the planes' range. On 6 February, twenty-eight modified L-5Bs of the squadron took off from Leyte for the airstrip at Calasio. They were escorted by some Marine Corps Vought F4U Corsairs and a Navy PBY Catalina that provided both navigation and fighter protection. As more planes were assembled on Leyte, they were also ferried up to equip the other two squadrons on Luzon. Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman (s/n 44-70439) from the 3rd Air Commando Group. Upon their arrival in the combat zone, the men and pilots of the squadron immediately began flying missions, evacuating wounded, flying supply missions and also performing battlefield reconnaissance with individuals flying as many as 20 missions a day. In its first three weeks in combat, the squadron evacuated over 1,500 wounded, flew seventy supply missions, delivering over 14,000 pounds of supplies. With such a heavy schedule of flights, it was not long before the first combat loss occurred. On 10 February, while flying over Japanese-occupied Nichols Field on a reconnaissance flight, SSGt Donald McDonell suffered wounds when the plane was hit by ground fire. Both of the planes wingtips were blown off and he suffered wounds to a knee and wrist; however he managed to coax the plane back to a recently captured landing strip in Grace Park, one of Manila's northern suburbs. He recovered from his wounds; the plane was written off. A few days after the Lingayen landings, the guerrillas of the U.S. Army Forces in the Philippines (Northern Luzon), along with Philippine Scouts, began to strike in force in the rear areas of Japanese-occupied territory. The men of this unit were a mixture of Americans who were stay-behinds from the Battan Campaign who escaped from Japanese forces and Filipinos who continued the fight after the surrender in April 1942. By mid-February 1945, the Japanese had been pushed back into the mountains of Luzon near Vigan. Seeking to exploit the situation, Fifth Air Force directed that supplies be flown into the area to aid the guerrilla forces. Several airfields which the Air Commandos chose where in pretty bad shape, with the runways pockmarked with shell holes. The planes operated from crude strips in the mountains, evacuating wounded, bringing in supplies, and supporting behind-the-lines operations of the Alamo Scouts. The unit also directed air strikes. Three 159th pilots lost their lives in the operation. S/Sgt Jack Smith was lost when his plane was hit by ground fire. He was carrying out two guerrillas wedged in the back seat. Despite the plane crashing and burning, his passengers survived without injury. G/O Robert Hutchinson and passenger Cpl. Alfred Bennet crashed in a narrow valley near Cervantes while trying to climb out of a confined area. Ferdinand Marcos was a member of the Filipino guerrillas and had his headquarters at Luna. A second detachment supported the 308th Bomb Wing. The detachment operated off a drained rice paddy adjoining the Lingayan Air Strip and was housed in a Nipa hut in the middle of a bomb dump. Activities included courier service, delivering weapons to guerrillas behind enemy lines, search missions, marking bombing targets and air sea rescue. One aircraft was damaged when its engine quit over the trees at the end of the landing strip. The pilot, S/Sgt Neil Livesay, received a written commendation from 5th Air Force HQ for his outstanding airmanship. His passenger was the 5th AF Flying Safety Officer. A third detachment operated out of Bacolod on Negros Island in support of Marines and the 40th Infantry Division during the Negros campaign. It was while performing a drop mission that M/Sgt Oliver M. Edwards, a Flight Leader, was shot down and later killed by the Japanese. His passenger was also killed and beheaded. M/Sgt was post-humorously awarded the Silver Star for his action in support of the 40th Infantry Division. He was also the first 159th member killed in action. A fourth detachment operated off the main street of Cebu City in support of the Americal infantry division. In addition to evacuation and supply missions, they participated in directing naval bombardment of the island, with naval observers aboard. Many of the evacuation missions were performed at night. Throughout the spring of 1945, as American forced cleared the Japanese from Luzon, squadron L-5s evacuated the wounded and the sick, dropped food and medical supplies to guerrilla forces as well as American infantry, directed artillery fire and air strikes, ferried officers from place to place, and performed all manner of tasks which it was assigned. A very atypical mission carried out by the 157th was to carry and lay a telephone line between two mountaintop positions, and also on one mission, loudspeakers were mounted to one squadron aircraft to broadcast propaganda to Japanese troops. In mid-April, the squadron received some glider pilots who were checked out on the L-5, which enabled the regular squadron pilots to get some much needed rest from their grueling schedules. The Japanese were retreating quickly and the order of the day was to pursue and attack them whenever possible, liberating village after village. However it was not all work and combat for the unit. Softball games were held and other forms of recreation were encouraged. Occasionally movies were shown and on one occasion, the visit of comedian Joe E. Brown was held. The news of the surrender of Germany on 7 May was welcomed. Combat continued through May and into June and at the end of the month, General MacArthur declared the Luzon Campaign over at midnight of 30 June/1 July 1945. However, the Japanese were still active in the Cagayan Valley, where the enemy had chosen to gather the remnants of their forces. Mission after mission was flown into the area, and it was not until 25 July that the Cagayen Valley was secured. =Okinawa= With the war winding down in the Philippines it was evident another move was in store. On 15 July, the squadron was ordered to move to Okinawa. The ground echelon left Mablecat on 15 June for Subic Bay to board an LST for the trip. The pilots were left behind and attached to the 160th LS. Upon arrival, the squadron set up a camp at Yontan Airfield, where the main Fifth Air Force airfield was located. After a few days, they moved to an area just north of the village of Bise on the Motobu Peninsula. Back on Luzon, the 157th's pilots began installing 75-gallon belly tanks on their L-5s and UC-64s to make the long over-water flight to Okinawa. The planes took off from Mabalcat and landed at Gabu on the coast, where their tanks were topped off and the planes given a thorough inspection. From there, the planes took off, shepherded by a pair of Air-Sea Rescue PBY Catalinas in a loose formation. After a seven-hour flight, and very low on gasoline, the squadron's planes touched down at Yontan without incident. At the end of July, the squadron received orders to move to Ie Shima. However, on 6 August, the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan and three days later a second atomic bomb devastated Nagasaki. On 14 August the Japanese announced their surrender. On 19 August, the squadron witnessed a bit of history when a pair of Japanese Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" Bombers, painted white with green crosses landed on the island on their way to Manila. They were carrying a surrender delegation to meet General MacArthur for surrender negotiations. The Japanese transferred to a C-54 Skymaster at Yontan while their crews stayed behind to tend to their planes and be observed by curious onlookers. The war ended on 2 September without any combat being seen by the squadron on Okinawa. =Inactivation= The end of the war found the squadron dispersed between Ie Shima, Yontan Airfield and some personnel still on Luzon. Personnel began to be sent back to the United States to be demobilized, and on 19 September, the remnants of the 159th left for Kanoya, Japan assigned to V Fighter Command to be part of the American occupation force. The 159th was assigned the duty of flying into various Japanese Airfields to monitor the ordered disabling of the Japanese aircraft. Some humorous incidents occurred with this operation. S/Sgt. Hankison landed on one field and found all the top Japanese commanders in formation and offering to surrender all the men, 100 aircraft and 50 tanks to him. At another field the pilot saw all the personnel run for cover when he flew over the field. The L-5s were particularly useful, due to its ability to land on roads and other locations where bomb damage had made airfields useless. Eventually, its personnel remained in the theater long enough to have amassed the required number of \\"points\\" and by the spring of 1946, most personnel had returned to the United States. The unit itself was inactivated by Fifth Air Force at the end of May 1945.Y'Blood, William T. (2008): Air Commandos Against Japan: Allied Special Operations in World War II Burma, Naval Institute Press, .** Captain Rush H. Limbaugh, Jr, (father of the radio talk-show host) was assigned and assumed command of the squadron on 21 May 1944. He had formerly been assigned to the Key Field Replacement Training Unit (TE), Key Field, Meridian, Mississippi. Shortly after the squadron's arrival at Drew Field, Tampa, Florida, he was hospitalized and replaced by Lt. William G.

The eye injuries thus inflicted on the man resulted in near-complete loss of eyesight. He had been knocked unconscious by the blast. He noticed blood running down his face when he woke up. Wagner had six operations on his eyes but remained almost completely blind. Aftermath Before his participation in the Stuttgart 21 protests, Dietrich Wagner had no political involvement with an exception during his university education. Pictures showing Wagner injured, with two people assisting him, were published in many German newspapers. During later demonstrations, some protesters put red colour on their faces to symbolize Dietrich Wagner. Tristana Moore of Time wrote that the photograph of his injury caused \\"a regional dispute over an unpopular building project instantly transformed into a national issue ‚Äî and the political repercussions are now reverberating all the way to Berlin.\\" Wagner became a symbol of the protest against the Stuttgart 21 project. The German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung wrote that he was the \\"face of the protest\\". According to the author Jakob Augstein, the picture had an relevant impact, causing Minister of Baden- W√ºrttemberg Stefan Mappus to lose his position. In 2014 he visited the United Kingdom to ask Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to not authorise usage of water cannons. In an editorial to The Telegraph Wagner opposed the use of water cannons.

Artist background Emily Hilda Rix (known invariably as Hilda) was born in Ballarat, Victoria on 1 September 1884. She trained at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. After the death of her father in 1906, her family sailed for England early in 1907, where Hilda Rix trained for a time before then moving to Paris. There she studied at the Acad√©mie Delecluse, took lessons with American impressionist Richard Emil Miller, and attended the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, where Swiss-born illustrator Th√©ophile Steinlen taught her. After successfully exhibiting works painted in north Africa, and a tragic marriage that ended within weeks when her husband, Matson Nicholas, was killed on the Western Front, Rix Nicholas returned to Australia. Rix Nicholas exhibited and painted in Australia in the early 1920s, before returning to France in 1924. The painting In 1925, Rix Nicholas created one of her most extraordinary works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost high, and wide, Les fleurs d√©daign√©es ('The despised flowers') is an \\"unnerving\\" and \\"arresting\\" portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress. The meaning of her pose and expression has preoccupied critics. While Pigot considered the subject to be \\"tense\\", other writers were less sure. Jennifer Gall thought that the subject represented tumultuous emotions, with a deliberate contrast between a pleasant setting and a disdainful expression. Artist Carole Best was in no doubt, concluding that the subject was \\"clearly pissed off\\". Curator Anne Gray of the National Gallery of Australia observed \\"considerable emotional heat emanating from the subject\\", but wondered whether it was the case that the subject was irritated, or whether her expression could in fact be \\"the glimmer of a smile?\\" Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was \\"a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous\\". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry, but with an eighteenth- century-style dress. The tapestry on which the backdrop is based was owned by the artist (though lost in a fire after her death). The dress was created for the model to wear for this composition. The work reflects the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, as she created a painting specifically with the intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: > For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this > picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it > tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. > Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on > either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand > out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends > a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint > conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth- > century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass > of detail harmonies [sic] perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is > a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an > expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and > the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear > indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the > general arrangemet, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the > columbines scattered on the polished floor‚Äîthose are excellent. The painting was purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 2008 from the artist's son, Rix Wright.

It covers a distance of across, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. The Grand Chord is a part of this line and as such is referred to by many as Howrah-Delhi line (via Grand Chord). Sections The long trunk line, amongst the long and busy trunk lines connecting the metros, has been treated in more detail in smaller sections: # Howrah-Bardhaman chord #Bardhaman-Asansol section #Asansol-Gaya section #Gaya-Mughalsarai section #Mughalsarai-Kanpur section #Kanpur-Delhi section History Construction of a line from Howrah to Sahibganj, for the proposed Howrah-Delhi link, started in 1851. The first Howrah-Delhi line via what later became the Sahibganj Loop was opened in 1866. With the completion of the Raniganj-Kiul section, the shorter Howrah-Delhi main line via Patna was in place in 1871. The Sitarampur-Gaya-Mughalsarai Grand Chord, which shortened the Howrah-Delhi distance even further, was completed in 1901 but was formally inaugurated by Lord Minto, then Viceroy and Governor General of India with a function on 6 December 1906. Electrification Howrah‚ÄìBardhaman chord was electrified in 1964‚Äì66. The Bardhaman-Mankar-Waria sector in 1964-66, the Waria-Asansol sector in 1960‚àí61, the Asansol to Gaya sector in 1960-62, the Gaya-Mughalsarai sector in 1962, the Mughalsarai-Kanpur sector in 1964-69 and the Kanpur-New Delhi sector in 1966-1977. The Howrah-Gaya-Delhi route was the first trunk route in India to be completely electrified (AC traction). In 1965, Asansol-Bareilly Passenger was the first long-distance train on Eastern Railway to be hauled by an AC loco. Speed limits Most of the Howrah‚ÄìGaya‚ÄìDelhi line is classified as ‚ÄòA‚Äô class line where trains can run up to 160 km per hour but in certain sections speeds may be limited to 120‚Äì130 km per hour. The Howrah Rajdhani (between Howrah and New Delhi) travels at an average speed of 85.8 km per hour and the Sealdah Rajdhani (between Sealdah and New Delhi) travels at an average speed of 84.70 km per hour. The Rajdhani Express ran for the first time in 1969 from New Delhi to Howrah. It took 17 hours 20 minutes to cover the distance of 1,445 km. The first Duronto non-stop express was launched on 18 September 2009, between Sealdah and New Delhi. It was followed by several such trains between other stations. The first double- decker superfast train commenced running between Howrah and Dhanbad on 1 October 1970. Passenger movement New Delhi, Kanpur Central, Allahabad, Mughalsarai, Gaya, Dhanbad, Asansol and Howrah, on this line, are amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railway. Railway reorganisation In 1952, Eastern Railway, Northern Railway and North Eastern Railway were formed. Eastern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company, east of Mughalsarai and Bengal Nagpur Railway. Northern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company west of Mughalsarai, Jodhpur Railway, Bikaner Railway and Eastern Punjab Railway. North Eastern Railway was formed with Oudh and Tirhut Railway, Assam Railway and a portion of Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. East Central Railway was created in 1996-97. North Central Railway was formed in 2003. Golden quadrilateral The Howrah‚ÄìGaya‚ÄìDelhi line is a part of the golden quadrilateral. The routes connecting the four major metropolises (New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata), along with their diagonals, known as the golden quadrilateral, carry about half the freight and nearly half the passenger traffic, although they form only 16 per cent of the length.

R. Ambedkar (also known as baba saheb) who fought against the country's practice of untouchability. It was later self-published by the author. Background In a letter dated 12 December 1935, the secretary of the Jat-Pat Todak Mandal (Society for the Abolition of Caste system), an anti-caste Hindu reformist group organisation based in Lahore, invited B. R. Ambedkar to deliver a speech on the caste system in India at their annual conference in 1936. Ambedkar wrote the speech as an essay under the title \\"Annihilation of Caste\\" and sent in advance to the organisers in Lahore for printing and distribution. The organisers found some of the content to be objectionable towards the orthodox Hindu religion, so intemperate in the idiom and vocabulary used, and so incendiary in promoting conversion away from Hinduism, that they sought the deletion of large sections of the more controversial content endangering Brahmanical interests. They wrote to Ambedkar seeking the removal of sections which they found, in their words, \\"unbearable.\\". Ambedker declared in response that he \\"would not change a comma\\" of his text. After much deliberation, the committee of organizers decided to cancel their annual conference in its entirety, because they feared violence by orthodox Hindus at the venue if they held the event after withdrawing the invitation to him. Ambedkar subsequently published 1500 copies of the speech as a book on 15 May 1936 at his own expense as Jat-Pat Todak Mandal failed to fulfill their word. In the essay, Ambedkar criticised the Hindu religion, its caste system and its religious texts which are male dominant and spreading hatred and suppression of female interests. He argued that inter-caste dining and inter-caste marriage is not sufficient to annihilate the caste system, but that \\"the real method of breaking up the Caste System was... to destroy the religious notions upon which caste is founded\\" Gandhi's support In July 1936, Mahatma Gandhi wrote articles under the title \\"A Vindication Of Caste\\" in his weekly journal (Harijans ) in which he commented on Ambedkar's address: > The readers will recall the fact that Dr. Ambedkar was to have presided last > May at the annual conference of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal of Lahore. But the > conference itself was cancelled because Dr. Ambedkar's address was found by > the Reception Committee to be unacceptable. How far a Reception Committee is > justified in rejecting a President of its choice because of his address that > may be objectionable to it is open to question. The Committee knew Dr. > Ambedkar's views on caste and the Hindu scriptures. They knew also that he > had in unequivocal terms decided to give up Hinduism. Nothing less than the > address that Dr. Ambedkar had prepared was to be expected from him. The > committee appears to have deprived the public of an opportunity of listening > to the original views of a man, who has carved out for himself a unique > position in society. Whatever label he wears in future, Dr. Ambedkar is not > the man to allow himself to be forgotten. Later editions and translations In the second edition of his book, Ambedkar replied to Gandhi's comments. This edition was published in 1937 as Annihilation of Caste: With a Reply to Mahatma Gandhi. He published a third edition in 1944; it included another essay, \\"Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development\\", which had been presented at a seminar in New York in 1916. In 2014, an annotated edition was released by Navayana, a New Delhi- based publishing house, with an introduction by Arundhati Roy titled \\"The Doctor and the Saint\\". Annihilation of Caste was translated into Tamil with the help of Periyar and published in 1937. Segments were continuously published in the rationalist Tamil magazine Kudi Arasu.  See also  * B. R.

It grows on the apse of the Hildesheim Cathedral, a Catholic cathedral in Hildesheim, Germany, that is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. The cathedral and the adjacent St. Michael's Church have been on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1985. The rose that climbs on the wall of the cathedral's apse is believed to be the oldest living rose in the world. A Rosa canina, commonly known as a wild dog rose, grows against the eastern apse of the cathedral, which is around high and wide. The rose bush reaches a height of around and documentation verifies its age at approximately 700 years. Slight variations arise in the tale of the establishment of the diocese by King Louis the Pious at Hildesheim in 815 but the rose bush is a common theme in all versions. The cathedral was destroyed by Allied bombers in 1945 during the Second World War, but the roots of the rose bush survived and it blossomed again among the ruins. According to legend, while the rose bush flourishes, Hildesheim will prosper. A poem about the rose was published in 1896. In the early twentieth century, after visiting the cathedral and seeing the rose, author Mabel Wagnalls was inspired to write a book, which went on to form the basis of a silent film. Rose A picture of the rose. The rose at Hildesheim is a Rosa canina, also called a dog rose. According to legend, it dates back to the establishment of the diocese of Hildesheim, around 815. The buildings were constructed around the area in which the rose was growing. Dog roses, the Caninae section of the genus Rosa, have around 20‚Äì30 species and subspecies, which appear in a variety of shapes and occur mostly in Northern and Central Europe. The rose that grows on the Saint Mary Cathedral belongs to the Rosa canina and it shows the specific features of a canina, being a deciduous shrub normally ranging in height from one to three metres; however occasionally it can climb if given support. The stems are covered with small, sharp, hooked spines to assist it in climbing. The leaves have between five and seven leaflets. The flowers are usually pale pink, fragrant, four to six centimetres in diameter with five petals, and develop into oval 1.5‚Äì2 centimetre red- orange coloured hips. The fruit is noted for its high vitamin C level and is used to make tea and marmalade. The rose hips are used in traditional folk medicine as a remedy for inflammatory-related diseases. In traditional Austrian folk medicine the rose hips have been used to make a tea for treatment of viral infections and disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract. The mature rose is also attractive to wildlife, various insects and serves as a shelter for nesting birds. The birds eat the hips in the winter. The rose blossoms usually survive for around a fortnight and appear toward the end of May but this can vary slightly according to weather conditions. The flowers have a pale, very light pink colour with a slight white colouring in the middle and they are of a medium size. The flowers have a rather light fragrance. The five petals of the flowers are weakly undulated. The leaves are shiny dark-green on the upper side and hairless on the underside. The rose hips are oval and quite elongated and of a bright medium reddish colouring. The thorns are of medium density and size. In 1945 during the Second World war Allied bombs devastated the cathedral, but the rosebush survived; the parts of the plant above the ground were damaged but the roots remained alive under the ruins, and the hardy rose regrew. Not all roses are so durable; the longest living rose bushes are mostly categorised as wild roses. Garden roses and other rose cultivars may have a much shorter lifespan of only a couple of hundred years. The tea rose has the shortest lifespan: it might not survive more than thirty to fifty years. File:20140426Rosa canina14.jpg File:Hohentwiel Hunds-Rose.JPG File:Rosa canina2.jpg File:20131210Hundsrose Reilingen6.jpg History of the settings The different branches marked After the Duchy of Saxony had been conquered by the Frankish Kingdom, Emperor Charlemagne in 800 founded a missionary diocese at his Eastphalian court in Elze (Aula Caesaris), a town in the district of Hildesheim, in Lower Saxony, Germany, about west of Hildesheim. He dedicated the missionary diocese to Saints Peter and Paul; it became the origin of the Bishopric of Hildesheim. His son, King Louis the Pious, relocated the episcopal bishopric to Hildesheim in 815, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, which is celebrated on 15 August. Thus, Hildesheim, one of the oldest cities in Northern Germany, became the seat of the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815. The settlement with the cathedral developed quickly into a town which was given market rights by King Otto III in 983. About fifty years after the diocese's establishment, the first large cathedral was ready. Also a monastery was built during this time by the Benedictine monk Saint Altfrid or Altfrid of Hildesheim, who became Bishop of Hildesheim and founded Essen Abbey, mentioned by the Hildesheim Chronicle. The cathedral was ruined by WWII bombings, but the rose survived. Legend Painting by an anonymous artist from 1652 illustrating the founding legend of the cathedral; it is held by the Hildesheim Cathedral Museum. In 1909, in his book Romantic Germany, Robert Schauffler tells the legend of the rose. In 815 Emperor Louis the Pious (778‚Äì840), son of Charlemagne, was hunting in the Hercynian Forest. While he was hunting a white buck, he became separated from his fellow hunters and lost his game and horse. He tried to summon help with his hunting-horn, but nobody answered the call. Disoriented and alone, he swam across the Innerste river then walked all day until he arrived at a mound covered with a wild rose, the symbol of the old Saxon goddess Hulda. The Emperor had a reliquary containing relics of the Virgin Mary over which he prayed for rescue until he fell asleep. When he woke up, the mound was covered with glittering white snow despite it being the middle of summer. The bush was in full bloom, the grass was lush and the trees were covered in leaves. He looked for his reliquary and saw it was covered in ice between the branches of the rose-bush. The Emperor's interpretation of this miracle was that the goddess was sending him a sign by \\"shaking her bed\\" that the Virgin should in future be venerated instead of her. Hulda is depicted as a maiden in snow- white clothes ‚Äì she is the protector of women's crafts but also associated with wilderness and winter ‚Äì when it snows, it is said that Hulda is shaking out her feather pillow. When his followers finally found the Emperor he pledged that he would construct a cathedral to honour the Virgin where the mound with the rose was. He did spare the rose, and built the cathedral in a way that the rose is growing now behind the altar in the apse. After more than a thousand years, the same rose bush still blossoms. According to a different version of the legend, the German emperor Louis the Pious lost his cherished reliquary while chasing game and promised that he would erect a chapel wherever it was discovered. The reliquary was found on the branches of a wild rose and the Emperor constructed the sanctuary beside the rose, with the altar close to the site where the rose was growing. Another slight variation to the legend is given in Fundatio Ecclesiae Hildensemens, an 11th-century publication. The Emperor had taken the reliquary to use when he stopped to say Mass while out hunting. The artefact was placed in a tree while the sermon was undertaken but not retrieved when the hunt resumed. Later a chaplain was unable to remove the reliquary from the branches. Believing this to be a symbol of God's will, the Emperor had a church constructed there instead of as originally planned at Elze. Film and literature One of the first printed works by Jessie Weston was a lengthy sentimental verse called The Rose-Tree of Hildesheim. A narrative about \\"sacrifice and denial\\", it was modelled on the story of the rose. Published in 1896, it was the title verse in an omnibus of her poems. Inspiration for the book entitled The Rose-bush of a Thousand Years came from the rose at Hildesheim. Written by Mabel Wagnalls and published in 1918, it is a tale about a young girl abandoning her baby to the care of a convent. The mother later gains notoriety, has a \\"spiritual transformation\\" and rekindles a relationship with her child. The story went on to form the basis for the 1924 silent film Revelation. The ninety-minute film starred Viola Dana, Monte Blue and Lew Cody. It was written and directed by George D. Baker.

The objectives of the offensive have been stated to be the taking over of all strategic observatories, government villages and the Mediterranean coast. Observers have stated a strategic aim was to force the Syrian army to redeploy forces to Latakia, which would relieve pressure on other rebels elsewhere in Syria. They reportedly succeeded in this with government forces being sent from Idlib, Hama and Aleppo to bolster defenses. During the offensive the Syrian military was joined by Hezbollah, Iraqi Shi'ite militia and Iranian military advisers. After almost two months of fighting, the offensive stalled and eventually petered out, with rebels losing most of their early gains. However, the rebels' established strategic bridgehead consisting of the town of Kessab and nearby territory remained. By mid-June a new advance by government forces recaptured the last rebel gains of the campaign, including Kessab. The offensive, and in particular the degree of Turkish involvement in it, has been widely attributed with the deportation of the native ethnic Armenians of the town of Kessab, who make up 70% of its population, and has been compared with the past Turkish killings of Armenians during the Hamidian massacres and Armenian Genocide. Background left The Armenians of Kessab were previously victims of Turkish violence during the Hamidian massacres, Adana massacres and the Armenian Genocide, last two of which took place in the last century and involved the massacre of two millions of Armenians. Three days before the assault on Kessab, the leader of Turkey's opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, called on Chief of General Staff General Necdet Ozel \\"not to embark on an adventure\\" with a military intervention in Syria, saying that \\"He [Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan] could decide to move the army into Syria before the elections.\\" Kilicdaroglu Kessab was the only city bordering Turkey that was controlled by the Syrian government. Syrian-Armenian war correspondent Sarkis Kassargian believes taking control of Kessab means taking control of the border crossing with Turkey, which allows anti-government fighters to advance toward the coastline, and in turn strengthen their position on the ground. In addition, the alleged capture of Samra village by rebel forces grants them access to the highest point in the village. Abdoullah Ali, an expert on Islamic groups in Syria, confirmed the takeover was headed by Abou Mousa al-Chechani (Chechnyan), among other senior and experienced fighters who had previously fought in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Iraq, thus indicating the importance of this battle. Human Rights Watch Syria and Lebanon researcher Lama Fakih told the UK Telegraph rebel groups had wanted to attack Kassab for a long time, but Turkey had previously denied them access, citing a lack of unity. Offensive =Initial rebel advance= An Ahrar al-Sham BM-21 Grad launch during the offensive In the early hours of 21 March 2014, rebel fighters led by the al-Nusra Front advanced from inside Turkish territory and attacked the Kasab border crossing with Turkey. The fighters reportedly crossed into Syria from the Turkish village of G√∂zlek√ßiler. Subsequently, the civilian populations of Kessab and its surrounding villages either fled or were evacuated, with most seeking safety in Latakia, as Kessab remained under the control of rebel groups.\\"Kessab Targeted by Al-Qaeda Front Groups in Cross-Border Attack from Turkey.\\" The Armenian Weekly. 23 March 2014. The rebel fighters initially managed to capture guard posts around the crossing but not the crossing itself. The also captured the nearby Al-Sakhra hill and a police station and directed mortar fire from the hill at the crossing and at the nearby Alawite village of Karsana, killing five people including a child. The leader of Al-Nusra for Latakia province was killed during the fighting. Rebels had also captured the Jabal al-Nisr mountain, but it was recaptured by the military within hours. By 22 March, the rebels managed to capture the Kasab crossing, while Kesab town remained under government control and fighting was still continuing around both of them. Government forces launched a counter-attack in an attempt to recapture the crossing and a security source stated the Army had retaken the previous day two police stations that were seized by the rebels. According to the opposition activist group the SOHR, rebels at the crossing had been targeted by government troops since the previous day. In the meantime, rebels directed their attacks against a strategic hill known as Observatory 45, which they captured later in the day.Syrian rebels seize strategic hill near Aleppo: NGO Overall, the SOHR reported fighting in three government-held villages that were coming under a rebel attack and three rebel-held villages which the Army was trying to capture. As fighting spread to other villages, the military responded with air strikes and ambushes which left 20 rebels dead and 30 wounded around Observatory Kherbah Solas. On 23 March, Turkish Air Force F-16 jet fighters shot down a Syrian warplane that allegedly bombed rebels fighting around the border post. The pilot ejected safely, according to a Syrian military spokesman, who also claimed that the plane was in Syrian airspace;Syria says Turkey shoots down Syrian warplane Turkish officials, however, claimed it violated their airspace. Meanwhile, significant military reinforcements were sent to the border area. Rebels also launched a new attack against the village of Kherbah Solas, about 25 kilometers south of Kasab. Opposition sources claimed that over 20 soldiers surrendered to the rebels in the village of Nab Al-Murr after a three-hour siege on a building. Later during the day, government forces recaptured Observatory 45 and secured the village of Al- Samra, while rebels captured the village of Al-Nab'in and the surroundings of Jabal al-Nisr, which forced the Army to evacuate it. However, the rebels were not able to capture the top of Jabal al-Nisr itself due to the Army's control of Observatory 45, which is the highest point in the region and oversees Jabal al-Nisr. During the day's fighting, the NDF commander of Latakia province, Hilal al-Assad, and seven pro-government militiamen were killed in fighting in Kasab. According to the rebel Islamic Front, he was killed when they used Grad rockets to hit a scheduled meeting of pro-government militia leaders in Latakia city. On 24 March, according to the SOHR, rebels were in control of the village of Kasab, after capturing the main square the previous day, with fighting continuing in the town's outskirts, specifically the hills outside the center of Kasab. However, according to a military source, neither side had control of the village and the situation was unclear. Rebel jihadists reportedly took Armenian families hostage in Kasab and desecrated the town's three Armenian churches. The Army managed to recapture the town of Nab al- Murr. Meanwhile, Turkish media claimed the leader of the pro-government Syrian Resistance militia, Mihra√ß Ural, had been killed the previous day. However, that evening Mihra√ß Ural posted a video on his Facebook account denying rumors of his death. Al-Arabiya television also claimed that two other cousins of Bashar al-Assad were killed in the fighting. According to Col. Afif al- Suleimani, head of Idlib's rebel Military Council, the Army withdrew many of its soldiers from Idlib province to reinforce their forces in Latakia province after the rebel offensive against the coastal area began. On 25 March, rebels captured Al-Samra and were reportedly advancing towards Anfal. A military source denied the village had fallen stating that fighting was still ongoing and that the Army was in complete control of the mountains overlooking Al- Samra. Meanwhile, fighting was still raging at Kasab, with the Army shelling the town and the Air force striking it four times around noon. Later, a pro- government news agency claimed the Army managed to recapture most of Kasab. According to the editor-in-ehief of Aztag Daily, information warfare was being conducted and that it was too early to conclude whether government forces managed to regain control of the town, but confirmed fighting was ongoing. Rebels had also once again captured Observatory 45,Activists: Syrian rebels seize coastal area after a Tunisian suicide bomber in an armored troop carrier blew himself up in the Observatory's yard killing a number of soldiers, including Colonel Samuel Ghannum, commander of Observatory 45. The fall of the Observatory removed the threat of artillery strikes against Jabal al-Nisr and the rebels were able to occupy its peak. Government troops from the hill retreated towards Qastal Maaf. Fighting around Observatory 45 continued. Meanwhile, the Army recaptured Al-Nab'in. Nineteen rebels and 16 soldiers were killed during the day's fighting and 40 soldiers and 100 rebels were wounded. The Turkish Army accused the Syrian government of \\"harassing\\" five Turkish F-16 fighter jets with surface-to-air missile systems. The Turkish F-16's intercepted four Syrian aircraft approaching Turkish airspace in Yayladagi and Cilvegozu of Hatay province in southern Turkey before the incident occurred. On 26 March, rebels slowly pressed their advance from Observatory 45 and attacked the town of Qastal Maaf. Fighting had also renewed at Al-Nab'in. The battle for both towns had been described as a seesaw one with both attacks and retreats. At the same time, fighting continued around Kasab, Observatory 45 and Al-SamraFierce fighting raging in Syria's Latakia as the Army intensified its shelling on Kasab and Al-Samra. The government mobilised thousands of soldiers and NDF fighters to retake the areas that had been lost to the rebels and many government supporters, the majority of them Alawites, volunteered to fight against the rebels. A military officer claimed rebels had been pushed back from Observatory 45, but were still in nearby areas. Another source also confirmed that the Army had beaten back the rebels from Observatory 45, but did not reoccupy it, instead securing the hill's surroundings. The military had also evacuated from Nab al-Murr, due to the town's vulnerability to rebel shelling from Observatory 45 and Jabal al-Nisr. Pro-government sources claimed 500 rebels and 50 soldiers had been killed since the start of the offensive, while the SOHR stated around 100 fighters on each side had died. The Syrian government called on the United Nations to halt the Turkish involvement in the Kasab region. It accused the Turkish government for \\"organizing, receiving, funding and hosting tens of thousands of terrorists from various Takfiri movements and facilitating their entry into the Syrian territories\\" and for providing the rebels with direct military support in the region. On 27 March, several helicopter and air strikes were conducted against Observatory 45,Activists: Syrian warplanes bomb rebels in Latakia while Jabhat Al-Nusra reinforcements arrived in the contested areas. Two pro-government sources reported the military managed to defend their positions at Al-Nab'in and Qastal Maaf and was advancing towards Kasab from the two towns. A pro-opposition source reported that rebels managed to capture Al-Nab'in but that fighting was ongoing as the military was trying to recapture both it and Kasab. Another source reported that the military recaptured Al-Nab'in after it received reinforcements from troops who evacuated Jabal al-Nisr. Fighting was also still raging around Al-Samra. A pro-government newspaper also claimed another 200 rebel fighters had been killed in the last day. The military intelligence head in Latakia province was reportedly able to escape after he was surrounded by rebels for five days in Al-Nab'in. By the end of this day, according to the SOHR, more than 150 pro- government fighters, including 14 officers, had been killed since the start of the offensive. On 28 March, it was reported that the rebels had blocked several attempts by the Syrian Army to send reinforcements to Latakia. On 29 March, Al-Nab'in was once again reported under rebel control, but with fighting continuing in its outskirts. Al Aan TV claimed that 10 pro-government fighters were killed in an attempt by the Army to recapture Observatory 45. It also reported the arrival of Hezbollah fighters in the area. According to a local activist, the FSA had set up a joint operations room under command of Brigadier General and FSA Chief of staff Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir to support the rebel offensive. On 30 March, the SOHR reported that several attempts by the Army to retake areas in northern Latakia had been repelled by the rebels. However, the military was bringing more reinforcements from the coastal city of Tartous to try to stem the rebel advance. =The battle for Observatory 45 = By 31 March, thousands of refugees reportedly fled to Latakia city, while a rising tension between the Armenian-Christian-Alawite community and the Turkmen community was reported. At this time, Barnabas Aid stated 80 Christian civilians were killed and thousands more displaced after rebel fighters captured Kasab; however, a delegation from the Armenian National Assembly visited and interviewed refugees from Kessab who fled to Latakia and concluded that \\"fortunately, no casualties were reported on the Armenian side,\\" though around 2500 were displaced. According to the SOHR, 1,052 fighters from both sides had been killed and wounded since the start of the offensive. Among the dead were 27 Army officers and 56 foreign rebel fighters. During the day, government forces made an attempt to advance towards Kasab as the rebel offensive started to stagnate and state TV made a live report from near the hilltop of Observatory 45 claiming the Army had recaptured it. The SOHR confirmed the Army made progress in the area and stated that government troops managed to install multiple rocket launcher on Observatory 45, but fighting was continuing in the vicinity of the hillside. Meanwhile, rebels hit the pro- government village of Bahloulieh with seven Grad missiles. Other pro- government villages were also shelled with mortars. The Turkish Army stated that they had returned fire after mortar shells and a rocket struck areas near the town of Yayladagi. After midnight, government troops ambushed rebels in the forest around Observatory 45 resulting in a number of deaths among opposition fighters. On 1 April, Ahmad Jarba, head of the Syrian National Coalition, visited the front-line in the Kasab region. The SOHR also denied State TV's claim that the Army had recaptured Observatory 45, stating that clashes were still ongoing over the hilltop. On 2 April, according to the SOHR, the rebels reached the perimeter of al-Badrousiya village where violent clashes took place amid new Army reinforcements in that area. Opposition activists in Latakia claimed that the rebels repulsed an Army attack on Observatory 45. During the fighting for the hill, the Moroccan leader of the Harakat Sham al-Islam rebel group, Ibrahim bin Shakran, was killed. A local rebel commander was also killed in other clashes, while \\"dozens of bodies\\" of pro-government fighters were reportedly bussed to the city of Tartous, according to opposition activist's claims. An opposition TV station also claimed that 11 Hezbollah fighters were captured in an ambush by rebels in the province, but this report could not be verified. On 3 April, according to the SOHR, rebels managed to regain control over the buildings of Observatory 45 after they were captured by pro-government fighters during the night. At least 11 rebels were killed in the fighting, while at least 20 pro-government fighters were killed and wounded. But later activists reported that government forces, supported by the NDF, had managed to reach the peak of Observatory 45 and clashes ensued with opposition fighters, including Jabhat al-Nusra. The SOHR also updated the past day's rebel death toll to 20. On 4 April, the SOHR reported that 64 rebels, including 40 foreign fighters, and 35 government soldiers were killed in fighting for Observatory 45 over the previous two days. 50 soldiers were also wounded and among rebel fatalities, beside the leader of Harakat Sham al-Islam, was the group's Egyptian military commander, Abu Safiya Al-Masri. Fighting was continuing around Observatory 45 with mutual bombardment from both sides, while the Syrian Army's chief of staff, general Ali Abdullah Ayyoub, visited government forces on top of the hill at the post. Eight rebels and eight pro-government fighters were killed and 15 wounded in the fighting at Observatory 45. Meanwhile, the Turkish Army fired shells into Syria, responding to six shells that landed in Yayladadi. =Continued Army advance= On 5 April, after midnight, government troops ambushed rebels on the road towards Al-Nab'in resulting in a number of deaths among opposition fighters, while two Moroccan field commanders of Ahrar Al-Sham were killed in fighting in Kasab. It was reported that Latakia city was hit by two Grad missiles during the day. On 7 April, fighting erupted on the edges of the Jabal al-Haramiya area with government forces advancing. The next day, Iranian Press TV claimed the Army had regained control of Jabal al-Haramiya. On 12 April, fighting erupted in Al-Nab'in and Nab Al-Murr and later in the day clashes were still ongoing in the towns perimeters. The next day, the Army recaptured Chalma mountain (also known as Sal-Darin mountain), near Kassab, while heavy clashes were still taking place near Observatory 45. By 15 April, the FSA commander for Latakia province stated the offensive had stagnated after rebel forces had become exhausted due to the number of casualties they had endured and a shortage of ammunition. Three days later, another opposition commander criticised the opposition Syrian National Coalition for not providing enough financial support for the offensive and supporting countries for not providing enough arms. =Capture of Al-Samra and the battle for the hills= On 27 April, government forces captured a guard post near Al-Samra, namely the town's police station, after an amphibious assault from the sea. As evening came, rebels had retreated from Al-Samra and government forces captured the village. The next day, the military secured Chalma mountain and engaged rebels on top of Tal Al-Ahmar, while other government troops, including Special Forces from Al-Samra, advanced towards Al-Nab'in. Four soldiers were killed and 75 wounded by mid-day, while an unknown number of rebels also died.Elijah J Magnier Government forces from Observatory 45 had also advanced, capturing Height 724 north of the Observatory. The Army further captured Heights 959 and 1017. Two days later, government forces were fighting rebels on Jabal al-Nisr mountain, near Al-Nab'in, and on three hills overlooking Kasab in an attempt to capture the hilly terrain before engaging opposition forces in the towns themselves.Elijah J Magnier Later in the day, government troops fully secured Al-Samra and its surrounding hills.Elijah J Magnier On 3 May, government troops captured radar hill 1013 overlooking and the next day fighting erupted in Al-Nab'in. In mid-May, rebels reportedly recaptured Hills 53, 724 and 1013, as well as Seriatel and Al-Nab'in hills. Opposition forces also attempted to capture Observatory 45, but failed. As of 18 May, the offensive was considered to had petered out. =Syrian army offensive ‚Äì Rebel retreat= On 12 June, the military started a new offensive and by the next day captured Hills 714, 767 and 803. On 14 June, most rebels retreated from Kasab, while a few of them stayed to protect the retreating fighters. This came after the Army took hold of areas that surround Al-Nab'in and advanced towards Kasab. The SOHR reported the military was moving towards nearby villages, including Al-Nab'in, while state TV already reported the capture of the town. SANA also stated two-thirds of Kasab were under military control. On 15 June, the Syrian Army took control of Kasab, its border crossing, Al-Nab'in and Nab Al-Murr, fully reversing all opposition gains during the three-month campaign. Meanwhile, the Army intensified its operations in the east of the province near Salma. Controversies =Allegations of Turkish involvement= It was reported that the attackers, members of the al-Nusra Front, Sham al-Islam, and Ansar al-Sham, advanced directly from the village of G√∂zlek√ßiler on Turkish territory, were being supported by the Turkish military, and that injured rebel fighters were being sent to medical centres in Turkey. Some Kessab village guards reported that the Turkish military withdrew from its positions along the border shortly before the fighters crossed from Turkey. Mehmet Ali Ediboƒülu, MP of Turkish CHP party, who visited the area several days after the attack began, said locals told him that \\"thousands of fighters coming from Turkey crossed the border at at least five different points to launch the attack on Kassab.\\" While journalists were barred from visiting G√∂zlek√ßiler, Ediboƒülu said he personally observed \\"dozens of Syrian-plated cars nonstop transporting terrorists and firing into the Syrian outpost from the military road between G√∂zlek√ßiler village and our military base at Kayapinar.\\" According to security sources in Kessab, the attacks were waged under heavy artillery cover by the Turkish army, while the injured were being carried back and treated in the city of Yayladagi in Turkey, which borders Syria. An terrorist told the Telegraph on 21 March \\"Turkey did us a big favour‚Ä¶ They allowed our guys to enter from their border post,\\" allowing them to finally access Kessab. Turkey denied the allegations as \\"totally unfounded and untrue\\", the Telegraph reported, but HRW's Fakih replied \\"it is not feasible that these groups could have crossed into Syria from where they did without the knowledge of the Turks.\\" =Turkish shootdown of Syrian fighter jet= After Turkish Air Force F-16 jet fighters had shot down a Syrian warplane near the border post, the pilot, who ejected safely, claimed that the plane was in Syrian airspace. Turkish officials, however, claimed it violated their airspace. Turkey's opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu (CHP) claimed that the Syrian jet was a reconnaissance plane and that its downing was part of a government scheme to provoke war with Syria to divert attention from corruption scandals enveloping Turkey's president Erdogan and his party. Istanbul-based journalist Amberin Zaman commented that the recently leaked audio tapes in which Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu is heard discussing ways to spark a war with Syria might vindicate Kilicdaroglu's claims. =Armenian civilian fatalities= The offense has been widely compared to the Hamidian massacres and Armenian Genocide, as over 70% of Kessab's population is Armenian and is one of the last Armenian settlements in the Cilicia region, where the Armenian population had been massacred twice by Turkey. President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan stated, ‚ÄúAll of us perfectly remember the history of Kessab, which was unfortunately full of hellish realities of deportations in the last 100 years\\", referring to both events. On 2 April, during a hearing before the House State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee and in response to a question by Congressman Schiff, US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, said that Kessab \\"is an issue of huge concern\\". Congressman Schiff noted that many of the residents were descendants of victims of the Armenian Genocide and that \\"there is a particular poignancy to their being targeted in this manner.\\"Samantha Power Questioned About Kessab, Syria by Rep. Schiff http://www.aaainc.org/index.php?id=7&no;_cache=1&newsID;=491 On 3 April Armenia's Minister of Diaspora Hranush Hakobyan said that 38 of Kessab's Armenian inhabitants had been captured when the town fell to the rebels, 24 of them were later released, 3 had been forcefully taken into Turkey and were now in the village of Vaqif, and that 670 Armenian families had been displaced after the attack on Kessab, with about 400 of the families, at least 2,000 ethnic Armenian civilians, sought refuge in Latakia and other neighboring hills. The minister also said that in Kessab, Armenian churches had been defaced, crosses on the churches had been removed, Armenian shops and homes had been looted.Minister Of Diaspora: Armenian Churches Were Defaced In Kessab http://www.mediamax.am/en/news/politics/9769/ Also on 3 April, Ruben Melkonyan, deputy dean of the Oriental Studies department at Yerevan State University, said that the Armenian community of Kessab was unlikely to recover and that what had happened were \\"crimes that make a genocide\\". A number of eyewitness accounts of looting and occupation of Armenian homes, stores, and churches left behind were reported in Kessab. Armed men entered the town, looted Armenian shops and homes, taking families hostage, and desecrating the town's three churches. Kessab Armenians who phoned their neighbors and relatives homes from Latakia discovered that their houses are already occupied by rebel fighters, who went on to taunt and threaten the refugees. Some of the rebels had spoken in Turkish. Some 670 Armenian families, the majority of the population of Kessab, were evacuated by the local Armenian community leadership to safer areas in neighboring Basit and Latakia. Ten to fifteen families with relations too elderly to move were either unable to leave or chose to stay in their homes. According to witnesses, the rebels had raped elderly women because they couldn't find any girls. Aftermath After the Syrian Army retook Kessab and the surrounding villages, news agencies and local residents of Kessab reported that the town's Armenian Catholic and Evangelical churches had been ruined and burnt by the Islamist groups, along with the Misakyan Cultural Centre.Rebels Robbing Homes, Desecrating Churches in Kessab, Syria Around 250 families from Kessab who had taken refuge in Latakia returned to their homes a day after the Syrian Army recaptured the town. On 25 July the St. Astvatsatsin Church in Garaturan was reconsecrated, with the first liturgy since the ending of the Islamist occupation taking place on 27 July, the day of Vardavar, and attended by a large number of people Armenian Church of Kessab Was Re-consecrated. Lragir.am, 28 July 2014. Foreign reaction * ‚Äì President Serzh Sargsyan made a press statement at the World Forum Convention Center in The Hague (Netherlands) expressing his deep concern over the events in Kessab, remembering that the Armenian population of Kessab had experienced exile and deportation in April 1909 and in 1915 (during the Armenian Genocide), making a parallel with the 2014 situation: \\"The third deportation of Kessab Armenians today is a serious challenge to ethnic minority rights protection mechanisms of the 21st century.\\" He also thanked the Syrian authorities for the steps being taken to protect the Armenians in Kessab. * ‚Äì Andrew P. W. Bennett, Canadian Ambassador to the Office of Religious Freedom stated: \\"Canada is deeply concerned by the recent attacks by al Qaeda affiliated armed groups on the ancient Armenian town of Kessab in the Latakia district of northern Syria during which Armenian churches were reportedly desecrated and Armenians driven from their homes...We stand determined that the perpetrators be brought to justice for such acts and to stem the rising tide of sectarian violence.\\".Canada Concerned by Attacks on Armenian Town in Syria International.gc.ca, 25 March 2014Canada Concerned by Attacks on Armenian Town in Syria News.gc.ca, 25 March 2014 * ‚Äì David Babayan, Spokesman for the President of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, said that Turkey continues its anti-Armenian policy, in particular in Kessab: \\"Through subversive attacks, Turkey tries to make Armenians leave Syria and aims to liquidate the Armenian community of Syria.\\" He also stated that while it would be preferable for Syrian Armenians to remain in Syria and preserve their communities there, Nagorno-Karabakh would be ready to accept and welcome any refugees. * ‚Äì Gennady Gatilov, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, condemned the attack on Kesab and the ethnic cleansing of Armenian Syrians in Latakia. He accused Turkey, the western countries and the Persian gulf states of supporting terrorism in Syria and called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation. The UN Security Council declined Russia's meeting proposal.UN Rejected Russian Proposal on Kessab http://www.lragir.am/index/eng/0/politics/view/32240 ** ‚Äì Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, condemned the attack on Kesab and accused Turkey of assisting terrorists and expressed his condolences to the ethnic Armenian victims. He said: \\"The official data says the attack on Kesab was carried out by al-Qaida militants affiliated with the so-called al-Nusra Front and Islamic Front. I am stating herein bindingly that these terrorists have nothing in common with Islam and cannot be called Moslems.\\" Kadyrov also accused the U.S. and European countries of remaining silent on the attack and accused NATO members of contributing to it: \\"These terrorists have been reared, fostered and armed by the West and trained by secret services of NATO countries. They are fulfilling a task to ruin Syria and weaken the Islamic countries.\\" * ‚Äì State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf stated during a press briefing on 28 March: \\"We are deeply troubled by recent fighting and violence that is endangering the Armenian community in Kessab, Syria and has forced many to flee. As we have said throughout this conflict, we deplore continued threats against Christians and other minorities in Syria\\". She ended adding: \\"The United States will continue its steadfast support to those affected by violence in Syria and throughout the region, including Syrian Armenians. We have long had concerns about the threat posed by violent extremists, and this latest threat to the Armenian community in Syria only underscores this further\\". The Congressional Armenia Caucus noted their concern in a letter to the President. ** The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA), has condemned the \\"onslaught on Kessab\\" and accused Turkey of facilitating the infiltration of radical groups in their attacks on Christian and other minority populations in Kessab. The group has also called on the US administration and Congress to pressure Ankara to end its support for \\"the destruction of Kessab.\\" In a statement, the group said, \\"For months, we have warned the international community of the imminent threat posed by extremist foreign fighters against the Christian minority population in Syria. These vicious and unprompted attacks against the Armenian-populated towns and villages of Kessab are the latest examples of this violence, actively encouraged by neighboring Turkey. We call upon all states with any influence in the Syrian conflict to use all available means to stop these attacks against the peaceful civilian population of Kessab, to allow them to return to their homes in safety and security.\\" See also * 2013 Latakia offensive  References  Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2014 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the al-Nusra Front Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Hezbollah Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Turkey Category:Latakia Governorate Category:Anti-Armenianism in Asia Category:Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan controversies ","title":"2014 Latakia offensive"},{"id":"42274859","text":"Victor Paul Vosseur (17 August 1831 ‚Äì 9 April 1911) was a French military officer.

She is introduced as a novice Inspector assigned to Division One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. Over the course of the series, Akane examines the social and ethical underpinnings of the Sibyl System's governance of Japan and her own idealistic values. Akane is noted for her remarkable psychological fortitude, which keeps her Psycho-Pass score consistently low in the face of extraordinary challenges. In addition to the anime series, Akane appears as the protagonist of the continuation film Psycho-Pass: The Movie (2015), and the manga and novel adaptations of the series. Akane was created as a relatable audience surrogate who would evolve into a noticeably strong-willed protagonist by the second series and the 2015 film. Writer Gen Urobuchi stated that when creating the duo of Akane and Kogami, their traits were balanced to make them striking. However, in retrospect, Urobuchi believes Akane became one of the strongest characters he ever created. Akane is voiced in Japanese by Kana Hanazawa and by Kate Oxley in the English dubs. Critical reception to Akane in early episodes was mixed as the media felt she was too weak due to her inexperience in the force. However, her character arc in the first anime and her stronger portrayal starting from there to her role in the sequels and the film earned major praise. Her dynamic with Kogami was also well received by the audience. Creation and design Akane Tsunemori was conceptualized by Production I.G staff to be the most relatable character in the series, acting as an audience surrogate who would critique the setting and the ideological conflict between the protagonist Shinya Kogami and the antagonist Shogo Makishima. One of the staff's objectives for the series was also to chart Akane's transformation into a heroine. Wanting the series to be \\"anti-moe\\", the production team avoided showing Akane removing her clothes, and instead featured scenes where Kogami would remove his. Akane's physical appearance was designed by manga artist Akira Amano. Due to her and Kogami being the lead characters, Kyoji Asano felt like he could care about them. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani shared similar feelings, stating he wanted Akane's traits to balance with Kogami's as they are the main duo of Psycho-Pass. He further stated that one of her original characteristics was her \\"masculine\\" traits despite of her gender. Since the character's creation, Shiotani had thoughts about what would her role be in the future, most notably regarding her imprisonment in Psycho- Pass 3. While Akira Amano conceived her looks, Kyoji Asano handled the anime design. Asano emphasized the major contrasts between them when illustrating Kogami and Akane; Kogami wields a weapon freely with one hand, and Akane wields it with both hands indicating that she is less highly trained. Kana Hanazawa voices Akane in Japanese Akane is introduced in Psycho-Pass as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese actress Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experiences she must endure as part of her policing role. During episode 11 of the series, one of Akane's best friends is murdered in front of her by Makishima. Urobuchi originally wanted the anime staff to show Akane's emotional reaction to the murder by having her throw up, but this did not make it to the final cut. Gen Urobuchi said that while creating Kogami and Akane, he tried to balance their traits but felt that Akane ended up becoming one of his strongest characters because of her development in the first television series when she clashed with Makishima and her ideals. Because the first Psycho-Pass series focused primarily on the clash between Kogami and Makishima, the second television series introduced an antagonist who acted as Akane's nemesis now that the plot centered around her. Psycho-Pass: The Movie characterized her as even more assertive and self-sufficient. Much attention is focused on Akane as Kogami is not present in contrast to the first series where the duo balanced each other's personalities. The creators were inspired by films like Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan, to tell a story about Akane searching a war zone for the renegade Kogami. The non-romantic dynamic between the two characters appealed to the creators because of the deep trust they have for each other. Both Japanese actors playing Kogami and Akane agreed; one of them believed Ginoza had more romantic potential with Akane. The duo was said to resemble Sumire Onda and Shunsaku Aoshima, the lead characters from the Japanese police comedy-drama Bayside Shakedown. Hanazawa was surprised at the proposal that she speak multiple English lines at the end in the movie although she enjoyed her work. The anime staff praised how she managed to convey different takes on Akane since the first series. Her stronger persona wsa felt to be faithful to the original Tsunemori from previous television series. Appearances =Psycho-Pass= The 20-year-old main female protagonist of Psycho-Pass, Akane joins Division One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division as a rookie Inspector. She is initially uncomfortable with apprehending or executing people based on their potential criminal behavior. On her first assignment, Akane stuns Enforcer Shinya Kogami and prevents the execution of a kidnap and assault victim whose Psycho-Pass spiked because of the trauma they had endured. While Akane is reprimanded, Kogami expresses gratitude for her intervention. Akane's tendency to question protocol puts her at odds with the cautious senior Inspector, Nobuchika Ginoza. As Division One pursues criminal mastermind Shogo Makishima, who seeks to undermine Sibyl, Makashima retaliates by taking Akane's best friend Yuki hostage. Makashima threatens to execute her unless Akane uses a shotgun to kill him, instead of relying on Sibyl and her Dominator. Akane attempts to use the shotgun, but hesitates and misses. Makishima retaliates and executes Yuki in front of her. Akane and Kogami later arrest Makishima but he escapes P.S.B. custody, prompting Kogami to go rogue to kill Makishima himself. Sibyl reveals the true nature of the Sibyl System: a group mind of asymptomatic human brains working in tandem to judge individuals. Sibyl wants to add Makishima's brain to their collective and asks Akane to arrest Makishima before Kogami can kill him, in exchange for sparing Kogami's life. Akane accepts Sibyl's offer and leads Division One to Makishima as he attempts to poison the country's food supply. Akane is incapacitated while doing so. Kogami uses the opportunity to execute Makashima. Sibyl informs Akane it will not kill her because it knows she will keep its secret out of self- preservation, and to avoid the mass chaos revealing it would cause. =Psycho- Pass 2= In Psycho-Pass 2 the C.I.D. find itself under attack by Kirito Kamui, an anti-Sibyl terrorist invisible to Sibyl's scanners. Kamui is immune to Sibyl's judgment because he was implanted with body parts and personalities of several victims of a plane crash caused by Sibyl many years ago. Sibyl's scanners see him as a collective entity, which it does not know how to judge.\\"Conception of the Oracle\\". Psycho-Pass 2. Season 1. Episode 8. November 28, 2014. T≈çgane attempts to influence Akane to murder Kamui by murdering Akane's grandmother and framing Kamui.\\"Gauging the Soul\\". Psycho-Pass 2. Season 1. Episode 10. Kamui uses a hacked Dominator to force Akane to lead him inside Sibyl's processing center. Sibyl implores Akane to eliminate Kamui, but she attempts to arrest him instead. Kamui then reveals the true reason he brought Akane; Sibyl's adjustment means that Psycho-Pass scores now factor in a Dominator wielder's own judgment and morality as well. Kamui believes Akane's sense of justice and morality is significant enough that she could judge and execute Sybil if she wished. Kamui then suggests Akane voluntarily join Sibyl, in the hopes that her morality will permeate throughout the collective and transform it into a truly benevolent force. T≈çgane ambushes them and tempts Akane to murder him by confessing to killing her grandmother. Kamui intervenes by simultaneously killing T≈çgane and letting T≈çgane kill him. =Psycho-Pass: The Movie= In the 2015 film Psycho-Pass: The Movie, Akane thwarts a terrorist plot by illegal immigrants from the Southeast Asia Union, or SEAUn, a war-torn superstate importing Sibyl technology to police its population. After seeing evidence that Kogami trained them, Akane is granted permission to travel to SEAUn to investigate and potentially arrest him. Akane meets Kogami, who is surprised to hear about the SEAUn terrorists in Japan. Akane goes with Kogami to visit the rebel headquarters which also houses many refugees. When the base comes under attack, Akane returns to the capital and hacks SEAUn's Sybil system to grant C.I.D. analyst Shion Karanomori access. They discover SEAUn's Psycho-Pass scanners have been hacked to mask the high Psycho-Pass scores of Colonel Wong and his forces. Akane is subdued by Wong and reunited with Kogami, who has also been captured. Wong admits to planning a coup d'√©tat, and having Chairman Han assassinated and replaced with an imposter shortly after Akane arrived. Karanomori disables the Psycho-Pass hack on Wong and his men, revealing them as threats to Sibyl's scanners and security drones. Akane's team also arrives to save her. Akane confronts the Han imposter and confirms it is a cyborg controlled by Sibyl. Akane argues that Sibyl depriving the people of SEAUn a say in their own government will create more unrest and civil conflict, and betrays fundamental human rights. She convinces Sibyl to announce, through its Chairman Han's avatar, free elections. Studio: Production I.G. =Other appearances= Akane also appears in the manga Inspector Akane Tsunemori, an adaptation of the first anime series, and makes a cameo in the prequel Inspector Shinya Kogami. She also appears in the series' self-parody manga, Gakuen Psycho-Pass by Shiina Soga, and is a supporting character in the visual novel Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness. The character appeared in the crossover Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle. In the 2019 anime series Psycho-Pass 3, Akane has been imprisoned for unknown actions and is expected to see judgment. Nevertheless, she is looking forward to the actions of two new Inspectors, Arata Shindo and Kei Mikhail Ignatov. In the finale, Akane, still imprisoned, meets a returning Kogami and two start discussing what they did during the time Kogami had left the society. She is released from jail in the 2020 Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector where Kogami invites her to a meal. Studio: Production I.G. Reception =Critical response= Reactions to Akane during the series' early episodes were mixed. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator liked the way the first episode focused on Akane's first day as a police officer and her opinions about it. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network and Thomas Zoth of The Fandom Post expressed similar response to her debut due to how she different she was from other cops. Zoth said that in later episodes he liked the relationships Akane established with Masaoka and Ginoza, which resulted in several interesting scenes, and grew to care about Akane during the first half of the series in \\"a somewhat ironically 'moe' way, as she's grown as a character\\". Neo magazine's David West noted how weak Akane's character was in early episodes because Kogami did all the work. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network was more critical of the character, calling her \\"a blank slate\\". She said Akane is \\"uninteresting and forgettable, and her previous role in the show as the moral compass seems to have waned as well\\". Fantasy Mundo's Patricia Llamas stated the manga adaptation was faithful to Akane's characterization as it explored the deep bond with Kogami and the flaws with the Sybil System, a theme also explored with the other members of the cast. Despite initial mixed reactions to the character, Akane's growth during the series earned praise. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post website was more optimistic based on her stronger behaviour. Silverman said that ever since her best friend's death at Shogo Makishima's hands, Akane underwent major character development as she due to how she views the law as well as bond with Kogami. In a later review, Dong said the character's uninteresting traits stop appearing in the second half of the series. Zoth appreciated her character arc in the climax as seen through Ginoza's perspective. Similarly, Bamboo Dong and Kotaku said, found her more appealing due to her character arc. As for the second anime, Kotaku praised the differences between Akane and the new Inspector, Mika Shimotsuki. In anticipation of the movie, IGN writer Miranda Sanchez expected to see more interactions between Kogami and Akane due to Psycho-Pass 2 lacking that. However, she noted this bond was not fully explored. Jacob Chapman enjoyed Akane's interactions with Kogami in the role such as one scene where Akane starts comparing Kogami with the late villain Makishima. Otaku USAs Alexandria Hill also praised the first interactions between these two characters for its action as it contrasted with the heavy use of dialogue in the beginning. In the book Law and Justice in Japanese Popular Culture: From Crime Fighting Robots to Duelling Pocket Monsters, Akane is regarded as a person committed to following the law despite acknowledging its issues. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post praised the actions of both Kogami and Akane in the film. UK Anime Network liked Kana Hanazawa for the stronger tone she provided for her character in comparison to the previous works; UK Anime News enjoyed the English version. =Popularity= Akane also won the Miss Noitamina award in an official poll involving characters that appeared in noitamina television series. In the 2013 Newtype anime awards, Akane was voted the third-best female character. In 2015, she once again took that place. The same year, a Charapedia poll, which asked fans to list their favourite \\"cool\\" women in anime, had Akane placed 10th with 257 votes. In a 2019 poll by Anime! Anime! she was listed as the top character fans wanted to have as their boss.
