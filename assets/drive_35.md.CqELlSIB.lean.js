Many scholars have suspected this sutra to be composed in China but not all scholars agree with this viewpoint.Yang 2016 There are two versions: the first is called the Humane King Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (仁王般若波羅蜜經), while the second is called the Humane King State-Protection Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (仁王護國般若波羅蜜經), more idiomatically the Prajnaparamita Scripture for Humane Kings Who Wish to Protect their States.Orzech 2002, p. 63 Both sutras are found in the prajnaparamita section of the Taisho Tripitaka. This sutra is unusual in the fact that its target audience, rather than being either lay practitioners or the community of monks and nuns, is the rulership (i.e. monarchs, presidents, prime ministers, etc.). Thus, for example, where the interlocutors in most scriptures are arhats or bodhisattvas, the discussants in this text are the kings of the sixteen ancient regions of India. The foregrounded teachings, rather than being meditation and wisdom, are \\"humaneness\\" and \\"forbearance\\" or \\"ksanti\\", these being the most applicable religious values for the governance of a Buddhist state. Hence today in some Chinese temples, the sutra is used during prayers on behalf of the government and the country. A second translation from a Sanskrit text was carried out a few centuries after the appearance of the original version, by the monk Amoghavajra (Bukong 不空), one of the most important figures in the Chinese Esoteric tradition, as well as a patriarch in the Shingon school of Japan. This second version of the text (仁王護國般若波羅蜜經, T 246.8.834-845) is similar to the original version (仁王般若波羅蜜經, T 245.8.825-834), the translation of which was attributed to Kumārajīva, but it contains new sections that include teachings on mandala, mantra, and dhāraṇī. Themes One theme of the sutra is impermanence. A passage which is popular in Japan is the , which in full reads , and is analogous to sic transit gloria mundi in the West. This is famously quoted in the first line of The Tale of the Heike, whose latter half reads: .Chapter 1.1, Helen Craig McCullough's translation Translations There are two classical Chinese translations extant: *the 仁王護國般若波羅蜜經 Renwang Huguo Bore Boluomi Jing (trans. by Kumārajīva in 410-412).Orzech 1989, p.18 *the 仁王護國般若波羅蜜多經 Renwang Huguo Bore Boluomiduo Jing (trans. by Amoghavajra in 765-766).Orzech 1989, p.18 Amogavajra translated the mantras.

Fauna Some 280 birds species are known from the park, but the true number is probably much higher because the park is little explored. Notable birds include Dysithamnus occidentalis, Touit stictoptera, Ara militaris, and Galbula pastazae. A mammal survey conducted at 2500 m on the eastern slope of Sumaco revealed 17 species, including eight species of bats. Larger mammals include Panthera onca, Tremarctos ornatus, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Tapirus pinchaque, and Puma concolor.

Part of the Marvel Noir universe, this alternate version of Spider-Man is a noir-themed take on the character and emerges in a version of New York during the Great Depression. While investigating a smuggling ring, Peter Parker is bitten by what seems to be a highly-venomous spider housed in a spider-god idol. Parker has a vision of the spider-god promising him power and then emerges from a cocoon, now possessing super-human abilities similar to that of a spider. As the feared vigilante \\"the Spider-Man,\\" Parker wages a one-man war against the criminal underworld in New York City, partly to avenge the deaths of his uncle Ben Parker and his mentor Ben Urich at the hands of the city's major crime lord, Norman Osborn. After Osborn's defeat, Spider-Man Noir continues his vigilante life for years and opposes the forces of Nazi Germany even before the United States enters World War II. Since his conception, the character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, including the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider- Verse where he is voiced by Nicolas Cage. Publication history The character, created by writers David Hine and Fabrice Sapolsky, and artists Carmine Di Giandomenico (who drew his first stories) and Marko Djurdjevic (who designed his costume). He first appeared in the four-issue mini-series Spider- Man: Noir #1 in 2009). The character became popular enough to quickly earn a sequel mini-series, Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face, starting at the end of 2009 and produced by the same creative team. Spider-Man Noir then appeared as a playable character in the 2010 video game Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, voiced by former Spider-Man cartoon actor Christopher Daniel Barnes and depicted as able to travel on web-lines for the first time. The character went on to appear in the 2014 storyline Spider-Verse, the main story of which was written by Dan Slott who had also scripted Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions earlier. After this, the hero featured in several multiverse crossover comics such as Secret Wars, the second Spider-Verse series, and Web Warriors. A version of the character wearing a fedora on top of his mask appears in season three of the animated series Ultimate Spider-Man in 2015, voiced by Milo Ventimiglia. In 2018, Spider-Man Noir was seemingly killed in the Spider-Geddon storyline, then appeared in December of that year in the theatrical movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, voiced by Nicolas Cage, using stereotypical 1930s dialogue and wearing a slightly altered costume. Following the movie, Spider-Man Noir was resurrected in Spider-Verse vol. 3 #5 in 2020, his appearance, personality, and dialogue now similar to his movie counterpart. An ongoing Spider-Man Noir monthly comic book series began months later the same year, written by Margaret Stohl and with interior art by Juan Ferreyra. Fictional character biographySpider-Man Noir Volume 1= On Earth-90214 in the winter of 1932, during the Great Depression, New York City is plagued by many criminal gangs.Daily Bugle photojournalist Ben Urich, known to some criminals as \\"the Spider,\\" attends a public oration on the struggle of the common citizen by May Parker in Central Park and befriends her nephew Peter Parker. Unable to attend university due to lack of money, Peter shares that his Uncle Ben, who fought in World War I as a pilot, was recently murdered by criminals working for Norman Osborn, an industrialist believed to be the crime lord called Goblin. Peter recalls his Uncle Ben's words regarding the futility and unjust nature of World War I: \\"If those in power can't be trusted, it's the responsibility of the people to remove them.\\" Peter works for Urich and in December 1932, he ventures to a warehouse of stolen antiques. One artifact — a spider idol — breaks open and releases a horde of spiders. One bites Peter, causing him to pass out and dream of a spider-god who claims it will give Peter power. The young man awakes in a black web cocoon and frees himself, discovering he now has spider-like powers. Donning a mask, Peter confronts Norman Osborn and is shocked to discover Urich present. The photojournalist has been blackmailing Osborn with his information on the mob boss's activities in exchange for the Goblin fueling his drug habit. Inspired by Peter's determination to fight the Goblin no matter what, Urich decides to expose Osborn's crimes but is murdered. Meanwhile, Peter creates a costume using elements of his uncle's World War I-era airman uniform, becoming \\"the Spider-Man.\\" Urich's former lover Felicia Hardy, owner of the Black Cat club, aids Peter's war on Osborn's criminal syndicate. In January of 1933, the Spider-Man kills Vulture to save his Aunt May, but the woman declares him just as bad for shooting an unarmed man he could've overpowered and captured instead. After Osborn's gang is largely defeated, Spider-Man has the opportunity to kill the Goblin but decides true justice means the man must stand trial and the truth become public record. Kraven the Hunter, one of Osborn's other cronies who is dying, then attacks the Goblin, killing him.Spider-Man Noir #4 As winter turns to spring, Franklin D. Roosevelt is now President, Hitler rises in power in Europe, May Parker continues being an activist for the common people, and Spider-Man Noir continues fighting crime and corruption. =Eyes Without a Face= Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face takes place roughly eight months after Spider-Man Noir. In September 1933, Peter Parker continues to operate as a photojournalist and helps at May Parker's soup kitchen along with his friend Mary Jane Watson. Meanwhile, the masked Crime Master rises as the city's new crime boss. Peter develops a relationship with Felicia Hardy, but she insists she is not his girlfriend. Peter and his friend Joseph \\"Robbie\\" Robertson, a struggling reporter, investigate the Ellis Island lab of Doctor Otto Octavius and his assistant Dr. Curt Connors, who are conducting strange experiments in mind control for the US government. That night, several kidnapped black people are delivered to Octavius's lab. Secretly working with The Friends of New Germany (TFONG), Octavius intends to prove that \\"inferior\\" people can be controlled with brain surgery.Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face #1-2 (2010) Discovering she is connected to Spider-Man, the Crime Master attacks and disfigures Felicia Hardy, nearly killing her. Learning that Crime Master is delivering people of color to Octavius, Spider-Man goes to the lab on Ellis Island and finds Robbie, only to find the man has already undergone surgery on the frontal lobe, leaving him without memory or clear free will.Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face #2-3 (2010) Octavius and Crime Master come to blows and the latter is killed. FBI agent Jean de Wolfe (a male version of Jean DeWolff) arrives and Octavius is arrested. Spider-Man is told Felicia, still recovering from serious injuries and her face now scarred, doesn't want to see him again. A month later, the government decides to deport Octavius rather than put him on trial publicly and risk he will reveal state secrets. The scientist arrives in Germany only to be humiliated when he realizes the Nazis believe his congenital disability makes him inferior and his work useless. As time passes, Felicia recovers from her injuries but now wears a mask to cover her scars.Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face #4 (2010) =Spider-Verse= The Spider-Verse storyline featured Spider heroes from various alternate realities being hunted by the vampiric Inheritors. The comic tie-in Edge of Spider-Verse #1 returns to Earth-90214 where it is now August, 1939. Peter has been operating as the Spider-Man for six years and finally attended university classes, while his girlfriend Mary Jane spent three years in Spain fighting with the Abraham Lincoln International Brigade. Wilson Fisk is a rising power in crime and sends illusionist Mysterio to kill the Spider-Man. Peter is then recruited by Superior Spider-Man to join a group of Spiders fighting against the Inheritors.Edge of Spider-Verse vol. 1 #1 (2014) Following an adventure in the Secret Wars crossover, Spider-Man Noir joins a team of six Spiders called the Web Warriors that regularly meets to combats threats to other dimensions, particularly those that no longer have a Spider hero of their own. The inter- dimensional Web of Life and Destiny becomes unstable due to the technology the Web Warriors use to travel between worlds. This causes some realities to bleed into each other and Spider-Man Noir's world to suffer time anomalies. Eventually, the team rights it and new teammate Octavia Otto helps create a better method of traveling between worlds that won't destabilize the Web.Web Warriors #1-11, 2016 =Spider-Geddon and Death= One night in 1940, Spider- Man Noir investigates a weapons sale between Herman Schultz and the Nazis. He fights alongside Felicia Hardy, now on speaking terms with him and operating as the masked vigilante White Widow. Spider-UK arrives and requests Spider-Man Noir on an important mission. The Web Warriors try to stop the Inheritors from using cloning technology to resurrect, but are too late. Spider-Man Noir attempts to kill the Inheritor called Morlun with a grenade, sacrificing himself in the process. The Inheritor survives and drains Spider-Man Noir's remaining life-force, killing him.Spider-Geddon #1 (2018) Later, Spider-Gwen travels to the Marvel Noir Earth to inform May Parker, Mary Jane, and Felicia Hardy how their version of Peter heroically died. May is furious to find out her nephew was a vigilante, \\"a broken man,\\" but Mary Jane and Felicia thank Gwen for giving them closure.Spider-Gwen: Ghost-Spider #4 (2019) =Resurrection= In Spider-Verse volume 3 #5 (2020), it is revealed that following his death in Spider-Geddon, Spider-Man Noir woke up alive and well in a web-cocoon on his native Earth-90214, having had a vision of the spider- god telling him his \\"service\\" was not finished. Now slightly more introspective and glib, this Peter Parker officially starts working as a private investigator, adopting a slightly new look and a more stereotypical 1930s dialect (similar to his film incarnation from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). Miles Morales appears and teams-up with Spider-Man Noir to retrieve the spider-god's idol from the Nazis so it can be used to repair the trans-dimensional Web of Life and Destiny. The two succeed in getting the idol back, but Miles warns that taking it away from the Marvel Noir Earth may also remove the spider-god's protection, meaning Parker's next death is permanent. Spider-Man Noir says he's fine with this, as death is supposed to be permanent for everyone and he neither wants nor deserves special treatment.Spider-Verse vol. 3 #5 (2020) =Spider-Man Noir Volume 2= In 1939, a month after his team-up with Miles Morales, people are starting to realize the Spider-Man is alive and back in action. Peter has re-established ties with Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson, who are both grateful that \\"a miracle\\" brought him back from death. Both support his life as a vigilante, but May advises he act more honorably than his instincts sometimes tell him to. As the new series opens, J. Jonah Jameson helps Peter gain access to police crime scenes so the young private eye can investigate a murder and in exchange provide the Daily Bugle with the exclusive story. Peter's investigation into the murder of Holly Babson, a waitress at the Black Cat club, takes him to Nazi Germany.Spider-Man Noir Vol. 2 (2020) Powers and abilities This incarnation of Spider-Man from Earth-90214 has the same basic powers as his classic counterpart: enhanced strength, speed, reflexes, resiliency, and agility proportionate to that of a spider; the ability to have his body cling to sheer walls or other solid surfaces; and a sixth sense which warns him of incoming danger, also known as \\"spider-sense.\\" While the mainstream Spider-Man uses mechanical web- shooters, Spider-Man Noir has the power to shoot organic webbing from his wrists. In his original two mini-series, Spider-Man Noir does not create web- lines, his dark webbing always manifesting as a spray or net.Spider-Man Noir vol. 1 (2009) After his resurrection, his web control is fine enough that he regularly creates web-lines to swing on and web-based projectiles to stun opponents.Spider-Verse vol. 3 #5, 2020. Spider-Man Noir vol. 2 (2020). Through his association with club owner Felicia Hardy, his vigilante activities, his associates at the Daily Bugle, and his occupation as a private investigator, he has a network of contacts throughout the city and several informants in the gangs.Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face (2009-2010) =Equipment= In contrast to the mainstream Peter Parker, this Spider-Man's costume is mainly normal clothing of the era matched with a mask. The outfit includes kevlar armor, making it resistant to bullets and explosions. The \\"costume\\" part of his outfit includes a mask made with the headgear and the aviator glasses used by his uncle during the Great War. After Spider-Geddon, Spider-Man Noir adopts a more traditional version of the Spider-Man mask colored black and white, though he keeps the goggles rather than relying on built-in lenses. He also begins wearing a fedora with his mask and a new gun belt decorated by a spider-symbol. Spider-Man Noir regularly uses .45 caliber pistols. He is a skilled marksman, adept in the use of various firearms such as revolvers and the tommy gun. He is willing to kill enemies in certain cases, but largely prefers to only injure criminals.Spider-Man Noir vol. 2 #1, 2020 Despite his superhuman abilities, Spider-Man Noir still relies on wearing glasses as Peter Parker, indicating his goggles may also involve prescription lenses.Spider-Man Noir vol. 2 #1, 2020 In other mediaTelevision= * An alternate timeline version of Spider-Man called Slinger, whose costume is inspired by Spider-Man Noir, appears in the Avengers Assemble episode \\"Planet Doom\\", voiced by Drake Bell. * Spider-Man Noir appears in Ultimate Spider-Man, voiced by Milo Ventimiglia. This incarnation is depicted as brooding and melancholy towards his hero work, resulting in him severing ties with his versions of Aunt May and Mary Jane. In the third season episode \\"The Spider-Verse (Part 2)\\" however, Spider-Man Noir is forced to work with his \\"prime\\" counterpart after the latter's version of the Green Goblin arrives in the Noir dimension to steal Spider-Man Noir's DNA. After helping Spider-Man and Mary Jane save civilians from a falling airship, Spider-Man Noir agrees to stop working alone. In \\"The Spider-Verse (Part 4)\\", Spider-Man Noir joins forces with a group of alternate reality Spider-Men to help the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man defeat the Spider-Goblin and Electro before returning to his home dimension. In the fourth season episode \\"Return to the Spider-Verse (Part 3)\\", the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid return to the Noir dimension amidst Spider-Man Noir's attempts to stop a gang war between Mr. Fixit and Hammerhead's gangs; with particular focus on the former as he blames him for an accident that killed his Mary Jane. As the Spider-Men and Fixit are forced to work together after Hammerhead's minion Martin Li uses a Siege Perilous fragment to become Mister Negative, Spider-Man Noir learns the truth of what happened to Mary Jane and sacrifices himself to save Fixit from Mister Negative's petrification blast before Fixit defeats the supervillain and restores all of his victims to normal. In \\"Return to the Spider-Verse (Part 4)\\", Spider-Man Noir is captured by the villainous Wolf Spider, who intends to siphon his powers along with those of his various alternate counterparts before the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man defeats him. =Film= * Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir appears in Spider- Man: Into the Spider-Verse, voiced by Nicolas Cage. He arrives in Miles Morales' universe along with Spider-Ham and Peni Parker due to the Kingpin's particle accelerator before joining his fellow Spider-People in returning to their respective home dimensions. This version talks in a stereotypical 1930s dialect similar to Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson, all of whom Cage based the character on. Due to his universe being entirely in black, white and grey, Spider-Man Noir is unfamiliar with colors and is seen playing with a Rubik's Cube after arriving in Miles' dimension, which he takes a liking to as he takes it back with him and sells it to the people of his world during the credits. * The Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Far From Home features a tactical stealth suit given to Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) by Nick Fury, which is inspired by the Spider-Man Noir suit. After Peter wears the suit in a battle against the Fire Elemental in Prague, he becomes known to the public as \\"Night Monkey\\", a name made up by his friend, Ned Leeds. =Video games= * Spider-Man Noir appears as a playable character in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes. After defeating his versions of Hammerhead, Vulture and Green Goblin to claim the Tablet of Order and Chaos fragments they had in their possession, Madame Web brings him and three of his fellow Spider-Men together to fight Mysterio after he absorbs the restored Tablet and destroys reality. After defeating Mysterio, Noir and the other Spider-Men return to their own realities. * Spider-Man Noir appears as an unlockable playable character in Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. * Spider-Man Noir's suit was available as a Gamestop pre-order bonus alternate costume for Spider- Man in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. * Spider-Man Noir's suit is available as an alternate costume for Spider-Man in Marvel Heroes. * Spider-Man Noir appears as an unlockable playable character in Spider-Man Unlimited. * Spider-Man Noir appears as an unlockable playable character in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. * Spider-Man Noir appears as an unlockable playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. * Spider-Man Noir's suit is available as an alternate costume for the titular character of Spider-Man.

The murder took place in the Docklands area of Cardiff, Wales, and Mattan was mainly convicted on the evidence of a single prosecution witness. Mattan was executed in 1952 and his conviction was quashed 45 years later on 24 February 1998, his case being the first to be referred to the Court of Appeal by the newly formed Criminal Cases Review Commission. Early life Mahmood Hussein Mattan was born in British Somaliland in 1923 and his job as a merchant seaman took him to Wales where he settled in Tiger Bay in the docks district of Cardiff. There he met Laura Williams, a worker at a paper factory. The couple married just three months after meeting, but as a multiracial couple they suffered racist abuse from the community. The couple had three children, but in 1950 they separated and afterwards lived in separate houses in the same street. Mattan had left the merchant navy in 1949, and by 1952 had done various jobs, including working in a steel foundry.Davies, pp. 20-21; Phillips, pp. 53-58. Conviction for murderMurder and investigation= Lily Volpert, a 42-year-old woman who owned a general outfitter's shop in the Cardiff Docklands area, was murdered on the evening of 6 March 1952. After closing the shop at around 8.05 p.m., she was about to have supper with her family in the back room when the doorbell rang. Her sister and mother saw a man outside the shop door and Lily went to deal with him. A few minutes later her niece saw her talking to an apparently different man at the door. Soon afterwards her body was found in the shop by another customer. Her throat had been cut with a razor or sharp knife, and it seemed that at least £100 () had been stolen.Davies, pp. 11-13; Phillips, pp. 18-24. The Cardiff City Police investigated a number of local men, including Mattan. About two hours after the murder two detectives visited his lodgings and questioned him. They searched his room but discovered nothing suspicious. There was no evidence of any blood-stained clothing, the missing money or anything that could have been the murder weapon. Later, other witnesses contradicted Mattan's alibi and the police interrogated him at length, and organised an identification parade attended by Lily Volpert's sister, mother and niece, but they did not identify him.Davies, pp. 15-16, 25-26, 36, 38-40; Phillips, pp. 65-69, 73-84. They also questioned two women, Mary Tolley and Margaret Bush, who had been at the shop immediately before it closed. They gave detailed statements but did not mention having seen anyone else in the shop. After Mattan had come under suspicion, they were shown a photograph of him and they said they knew him by sight but had not seen him for about a month. But following further intensive questioning, Mary Tolley made another statement in which she said Mattan had come into the shop while they were there and had then left. But her companion, Margaret Bush, still said she had seen no one there. Mattan was arrested immediately after this and on the following day, ten days after the crime, he was charged with Lily Volpert's murder. Mary Tolley later made a further statement in which she said she had not seen Mattan leave the shop. The police suggested that Mattan had hidden and murdered Lily Volpert immediately after the two women had left. They suppressed Tolley's earlier detailed statement which had not mentioned anyone being there. They also suppressed the original statements of Lily's family, which implied that she had been seen at the door twice after that. They then argued that this had happened earlier, before the women arrived.Davies, pp. 17-18; Phillips, pp. 93-104, 121-127. =Committal proceedings= The prosecution case was presented at the committal proceedings in Cardiff magistrates' court on 16-18 April. Beforehand, the police confronted Mattan with another witness, a 12-year-old girl who had called at the shop at around 8 p.m. and had seen a dark-skinned man nearby. But she said Mattan was not the man she had seen. During the hearing, Mary Tolley changed her evidence again, failing to identify Mattan as the man who had come into the shop. But another witness, Harold Cover, a Jamaican with a history of violence, did identify him. He had walked past the shop around the time of the murder and had seen two Somalis outside. One was walking out of the porch and the other - a six-foot-tall man - was standing near the door. In court he said the first man was Mattan. In fact, he had earlier identified the first man as another Somali living in the area at the time, Tahir Gass, but this did not become publicly known until 1998. The outcome was that Mattan was committed for trial.Davies, pp. 31-32; Phillips, pp. 137-144, 267-268. =Trial= The trial took place at the Glamorgan Assizes in Swansea on 22-24 July 1952. Harold Cover was the main prosecution witness. Another witness, May Gray, gave evidence that she had seen Mattan with a wad of banknotes soon after the murder. But Mattan's counsel suggested she was lying and motivated by a reward of £200 () that had been offered by the Volpert family, of which Cover later received part. Evidence was also presented that microscopic specks of blood had been found on a pair of Mattan's shoes. But the shoes had been reclaimed from a salvage dump and there was no scientific evidence linking the blood to the murder. Although Mary Tolley gave evidence, the jury was not told that other witnesses had failed to identify Mattan. Mattan's barrister succeeded in having a large part of the prosecution evidence ruled inadmissible because of the restrictions that then existed on questioning suspects in custody. But in his closing speech he described his client as \\"Half-child of nature; half, semi-civilised savage\\". These comments may have prejudiced the jury and undermined Mattan's defence. Mattan was convicted of the murder of Lily Volpert and the judge passed the mandatory sentence of death.Davies, pp. 44-50; Phillips, pp. 156-200. =Execution= Mattan was refused leave to appeal and to call further evidence in August 1952, and the Home Secretary decided he would not be reprieved. On 3 September 1952, six months after the murder of Volpert, he was hanged at Cardiff Prison. He was the last person to be hanged at the prison.Davies, pp. 51-58; Phillips, pp. 201-211. Subsequent events In 1954 Tahir Gass, the man seen outside Lily Volpert's shop by Harold Cover, was convicted of murdering wages clerk Granville Jenkins in a country lane near Newport, Monmouthshire. Jenkins had been stabbed to death in a frenzied attack. At Gass's trial, medical evidence was presented that he was suffering from schizophrenia and was delusional. He was found to be insane and sent to Broadmoor, but less than a year later he was discharged and repatriated to the protectorate of British Somaliland, later part of Somalia and now Somaliland.Thomas, pp. 103-111; Davies, pp. 68-70; Phillips, pp. 222-232. In 1969 Harold Cover was convicted of the attempted murder of his daughter in Cardiff, by cutting her throat with an open razor, and sentenced to life imprisonment.Davies, p. 59; Phillips, pp. 243-244. Mattan's middle son, Omar was found dead on a Scottish beach in 2003, and an open verdict was returned. Posthumous appeal The first attempt to overturn Mattan's conviction came in 1969 after Harold Cover's conviction for attempted murder had raised concerns about the case in Cardiff. But the Home Secretary James Callaghan decided not to reopen the case. By this stage, three years had passed since the death penalty's abolition.Davies, pp. 60-64; Phillips, pp. 245-256. In 1996 the family was given permission to have Mattan's body exhumed and moved from a felon's grave at the prison to be buried in consecrated ground in a Cardiff cemetery. His tombstone says: \\"KILLED BY INJUSTICE.\\" When the Criminal Cases Review Commission was set up in the mid 1990s, Mattan's case was the first to be referred by it. On 24 February 1998 the Court of Appeal came to the judgement that the original case was, in the words of Lord Justice Rose, \\"demonstrably flawed\\". The family were awarded £725,000 compensation, to be shared equally among Mattan's wife and three children. The compensation was the first award to a family for a person wrongfully hanged.

The concept is characterized by the growth habit: not only are new pseudobulbs added at the base of the old ones (as is typical of sympodial orchids), but new pseudobulbs also grow at the apices of the old ones. Many species are quite similar and difficult to distinguish, but some are clearly distinct. A few have showy colors. The genus comprises nearly 70 species. Distribution Scaphyglottis species grow over a large area, stretching from southern Mexico and the Caribbean Islands to southern Bolivia and much of Brazil, ranging from hot, humid tropical rain forests near sea level through dry forests of the uplands to the cloud forests high in the Andes. The center of diversity is in southern Central America. They usually grow high in trees, or in other highly illuminated locations. Description The plants are epiphytic, or sometimes lithophytic. They show considerable variation in size, ranging from a few cm to nearly 1 m tall. They all have narrow, elongated pseudobulbs covered at the base by numerous evanescent sheaths. Each pseudobulb bears up to three long, narrow apical leaves. The pseudobulbs are superposed i. e. tend to grow in stacked chains, one arising from the apex of another. The inflorescence grows from the apex of the pseudobulb, and differs from most sympodial orchids in that one pseudobulb will sometimes produce inflorescences for several years. This, combined with the habit of new pseudobulbs growing from the apices of old ones, creates the impression that there are inflorescences growing from the middle of the stem. The inflorescence can be solitary, successive, racemose or paniculate. The flowers are small, and nearly always white, cream, or a pale shade of green or lavender, with the exception of two species of Hexisea, which are mostly brilliant red. The petals and sepals have nearly the same length, but the petals are usually wider, and the lip is usually the largest perianth segment. The anther is terminal, and contains four to six pollinia. Most Scaphyglottis are pollinated by insects; nearly all species produce nectar which accumulates in the nectary formed by the base of the lip and the bottom of the column. The two species of Hexisea are possibly also pollinated by hummingbirds, which are especially known to visit red flowers.  Taxonomic history  The genus was published by Eduard Friedrich Poeppig and Stephan Ladislaus Endlicher in 1835.Eduardus Poeppig and Stephan Endlich Nova genera ac species plantarum, quas in regno Chilensi Peruviano et in terra Amazonica, (Leipzig) F. Hofmeister (Ed.), 1835–45. 1:58. In 1960, Robert Louis Dressler designated Fernandezia graminifolia Ruiz & Pavon, now known as Scaphyglottis graminifolia, to be the type species. The generic epithet comes from the Greek skaphe, concave or hollow, and glotta, tongue, in reference to the shape of the floral labellum. This definition of Scaphyglottis was unclear for a long time.Bryan Roger Adams (1993) _A taxonomic revision of the genus Scaphyglottis (Orchidaceae - Epidendroideae)_. Ph.D. dissertation, Southern University at Carbondale, IL. There is a large group of species clearly belonging to the genus, such as the now defunct three small genera Tetragamestus, Leaoa, and Hexadesmia, which were brought into synonymy decades ago. In 1993, a review of Scaphpyglottis was published which did not include a complete synonymy, but which was nevertheless useful in clarifying many of the species in the genus. Many of the species belonging to Scaphyglottis before the unification are also confusing and variable, forming various complexes of reproductively isolated groups that seem morphologically identical. = Synonymy--A confusing and controversial subject = In 2004, several other genera were brought into synonymy with Scaphyglottis as the concept is used today: Hexadesmia This genus containing 27 species was described by Adolphe- Théodore Brongniart in 1843.Adolphe-Théodore Brogniart (1842)Annales des Sciences Naturelles; Botanique 2, 17:45. It consisted of several different species separated from Scaphyglottis because the flowers had six pollinia instead of four. Because all of these species are in the basal clade of Scaphyglottis, six pollinia seems likely to be the ancestral condition of Scaphyglottis.Robert Dressler (2001) \\"Scaphyglottis\\" in AM Pridgeon, PG Cribb, MW Chase, and FN Rasmussen, Eds.: Genera Orchidacearum 4 Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Several other authors, including Schlechter and Reichenbach, placed additional species in Hexadesmia. Leaoa: In 1922, Rudolf Schlechter and Paulo de Campos PortoRudolf Schlechter and Paulo de Campos Porto (1922) Archivos do Jardim Bôtanico do Rio de Janeiro 3:292. erected this small genus for a species that had previously been called Hexadesmia monophylla, which had a very long inflorescence, rather than the short inflorescence typical of Hexadesmia, as well as the typical six pollinia. More species were added to the genus by Leslie Andrew Garay in 1955Leslie Andrew Garay (1955)Archivos do Jardim Bôtanico do Rio de Janeiro 13:45. and by Freidrich Gustav Brieger in 1976,Freidrich Gustav Brieger (1976) Orchideen 8 (2932):488. bringing the total to four. Tetragamestus: Heinrich gustav Reichenbach described Tetragamestus modestus in 1854.Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1854) Bonplandia 2:21 Three additional species have been assigned to this genus, the last by Schlechter in 1818.Rudolf Schlechter Beihefte zum Botanischen Centralblatt 36(2):400 The most widely known species is T. modestus, a name which can be confused with reichenbachanthus modestus, a synonym of S. brasiliensis. The name Tetragamestus is widely used by orchid enthusiasts, many of whom reject the inclusion of this genus in Scaphyglottis.Arquivos da Coordenadoria das Associacoes de Orquidofilos do Brasil (2008). Reichenbachanthus: João Barbosa Rodrigues published Reichenbachanthus modestus in 1882. Four species of pendant epiphytes which occur from Central America to southeastern Brazil in tropical rain forests have been included in this genus, the last in 1997 by Dressler.Robert Louis Dressler Novon 7(2):124 (1997) The terete (= narrowly cylindrical) pseudobulb is difficult to distinguish from the single terete leaf. The base of the full or slightly trilobate lip forms a nectary together with the column, the column foot, and the base of the lateral sepals. The column is long and thick with an apical anther containing four pollinia. The pale yellow or green flowers feature lanceolate petals, smaller than the sepals. * Reichenbachanthus modestus, originally published as Fractiunguis brasiliensis and also published in 1877 as Hexisea reflexa (Reichenbach) is now Scaphyglottis reflexa. * Reichenbachanthus reflexus, also published as Fractiunguis reflexus and Hexisea reflexa is now Scaphyglottis emarginata. *Reichenbachanthus cuniculatus, originally published as Fractiunguis cuniculatus in 1923, also published as Hexisea cuniculata in 1925, is now Scaphyglottis cuniculata (Schltr.) Dressler (2002). *Reichenbachanthus subulatus(Schltr.) Dressler (1997) was originally published as Scaphyglottis subulata Schltr. (1910).Schlechter, Repert. Spec. Nov. Regni Veg. 8:454 (1910). It has also been published as Reichenbachanthus lankesteri (Ames) DE Mora-Retana & JB García-Castro (1992)DE Mora-Retana & JB García-Castro, Brenesia 37:81–82. (1992) and Hexisea lankesteri Ames (1925).O Ames, Schedulae Orchidianae 9:47–48(1925) Fractiunguis was published by Schlechter in 1922, and has been considered a synonym of Reichenbachanthus almost from that time.Rudolf Schlechter: Anexos das Memórias do Instituto de Butantan : Secção de Botânica 1(4):55. (1922) It consisted of three species: *Fractiunguis reflexus Schlechter (1922) *Fractiunguis cuniculatus Schlechter (1923) *Fractiunguis cuniculatus var gracilis Schlechter (1923) Hexisea: In 1834, John Lindley published Hexisea bidentata.Lindley, Hooker's Journal of Botany 1:8 (1834) The generic epithet refers to the six perianth segments being nearly equal in size and shape. Fourteen species have been placed in this genus before it was reduced to synonymy under Scaphyglottis, despite having priority to Scaphyglottis. The plants are epiphytic or rupicolous (rock dwelling) and caespitose, sometimes hanging down from branches of trees. They grow naturally in tropical and equatorial, humid, low-altitude forests from southern Mexico to northern and northwestern South America. The original two species (H. bidentata and H. imbricata, originally published as H. bidentata var. imbricata) are distinguished from Scaphyglottis by small, almost entirely red flowers, with nearly equal perianth segments. It is the only group pollinated by hummingbirds.Robert Dressler (2001) \\"Scaphyglottis\\" in AM Pridgeon, PJ Cribb, MW Chase, and FN Rasmussen eds. Genera Orchidacearum 4 Oxford University Press The vegetative morphology is similar to Scaphyglottis. The pseudobulbs are typically cylindrical or fusiform, bear deciduous linear- lanceolate leaves, and grow one from at the apex of another to form articulated chains. The racemose inflorescence is apical or from the nodes of the joints between pseudobulbs, with few flowers open simultaneously (generally only two or three) being produced over several years. The red or orange flowers have lanceolate sepals and petals. The labellum is simple and folded down, the same color as the other perianth segments. In some species (e.g., H. bidentata) there is a bright yellow callus in the form of two teeth near the base of the labellum. The pollinarium contains four pollinia. According to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Hexisea is the name that should be used for all Scaphyglottis, because the name Hexisea (for one of these species) was published before Scaphyglottis. However, Dressler suggested that the name Scaphyglottis be retained to avoid changing the names of a large number of well known species.,Robert Louis Dressler (1994) \\"Proposal to conserve Scaphyglottis against Hexisea (Orchidaceae)\\". Taxon 43:665–666. and that the formally correct name Hexisea be used only when referring to those species which had been traditionally known as Hexisea. On the strength of this recommendation, Kew has made Scaphyglottis the accepted name, and reduced the correct name Hexisea to synonymy.http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?accepted_id=262807&repSynonym;_id=-9998&name;_id=99099&status;=false Euothonaea was published by Reichenbach in 1852, but was invalid for technical reasonsHeinrich Gustav Reichenbach, Botanische zeitung 10:772, Berlin (1852). This genus has always been relegated to synonoymy under Hexisea. *Euothonea oppositifolia (A.Rich. & Galeotti) Rchb.f. (1852) was previously published as Epidendrum oppositifoliium A.Rich. & Galeotti (1854). In 1850, it was published as Diothonea oppositifolia (A.Rich. & Galeotti) Rchb.f. and in 1862 as Hexisea oppositifolia (A.Rich. & Galeotti) Rchb.f. In 2002, Dressler reduced it to synonymy under Hexisea imbricata by publishing the name Scaphpyglottis imbricata. Costaricaea was erected by Schlechter in 1923 for Costaricaea amparoana,Rudolf Schlecther, Repertorium Specierum Novarum regni Vegetabilis, Beihefte 19:30 which was moved to Hexisea amparoana in 1934 Ames, FT Hubb. & C.Schweinf., Botanical Museum Leaflet 3:40. (1934) and then to Scaphyglottis amparoana in 1964.Dressler, Taxon 13:246. (1964) Platyglottis was proposed in 1942 by Louis Otto Williams for the new Panamanian species Platyglottis coriacea.Louis Otto Williams, Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 29(4):345. (1942) In 2004, Dressler transferred it to Scaphyglottis coriaceae.Dressler, Brittonia 56(1):64. (2004) Although the pseudobulbs of this species grow from the apices of previous pseudobulbs like the rest of the genus Scaphyglottis, this species differs by having wide. flat, coriaceous, alternate leaves, and an apical racemose inflorescence with up to four pale flowers open at once, featuring long ovaries and large bracts at the base of the peduncle. Both the vegetative and floral morphology make this species easy to distinguish for the other species of Scaphyglottis. Helleriella. In 1974 Garay and Sweet transferred Scaphyglottis punctulata (Reichenbach f.) C. Schweinfurth,Botanical Museum Leaflets of Harvard University 17:47 (1955) (Ponera punctulata Reichenbach f., Epidendrum dussii Cogniaux) to the Andean genus Helleriella without any explanation. A comparison of S. punctulata with the two species of Helleriella shows that it fits poorly into that genus. Except for a somewhat unusual habit it is a typical Scaphyglottis. This is also confirmed by molecular data. =Sub-taxa= A study of inner transcribed spacer data has suggested that the illegitimate name Pachystele Schltr. (1923) corresponds to a well-supported clade distinct from the remainder of the modern concept of Scaphyglottis, as does the species S. livida.Dressler, Whitten, & Williams: \\"Phylogenetic relationships of Scaphyglottis and related genera (Laeliinae: Orchidaceae) based on nrDNA ITS sequence data\\" Brittonia, 56:58—66 (2004). The New York Botanical Garden Press, Bronx, NY. The authors of the study noted that this \\"Pachystele clade\\" corresponds roughly to Hexisea sensu lato: * S. amparoana * S. arctata * S. bidentata * S. chlorantha * S. confusa * S. cuniculata * S. corallorrhiza * S. densa * S. fasciculata * S. gentryi * S. gigantea * S. imbricata * S. jimenezii * S. reflexa * S. sigmoidea The paper did not publish any names for these three suggested sub- taxa of Scaphyglottis, but did publish three new combinations.

It was produced by pollinating a S. pulchella (then known as Hexadesmia pulchella) with a S. aurea (then known as Hexisea aurea). * Epiglottis Rumrill Elf was registered in 1985 by J Rumrill. It was produced by pollinating a S. crurigera with an Epidendrum radicans.  Medical use  In response to reports of the use of Scaphyglottis species in popular medicine for pain relief, a study was performed which showed that oral administration of certain substances (5alpha- lanosta-24,24-dimethyl-9(11),25-dien-3beta-ol, cyclobalanone, gigantol, and 3,4'-dihydroxy-3',4,5-trimethoxybibenzyl) found in S. livida produced anti- inflammatory and antinociceptive effects in rats and mice, apparently (at least partially) by activation of opioid receptors.Déciga-Campos M, Palacios- Espinosa JF, Reyes-Ramírez A, Mata R.

They are referred to by many names in European historical records, since the colonists often adopted names given to them by other nations. The Nipissing are part of the Anishinaabe peoples, a grouping of people speaking Algonquin languages, which includes the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Algonquins. This broad heritage is likely the result of the Nipissings' living at a geographical crossroads, a watershed divide. Geography Waterfront on Lake Nipissing in Garden Village Lake Nipissing drains via the French River into Georgian Bay and, to the east of Lake Nipissing, Trout Lake drains via the Mattawa River into the Ottawa River. Living at the crossroads between two watersheds, the Nipissing were key to trade to the east, west, north and south of Lake Nipissing. The French portaged the watershed divide extensively to reach the Great Lakes by canoe from their settlements around Montreal on the Saint Lawrence River. To the west the Nipissing trade routes extended as far as Lake Nipigon and their Ojibwa neighbours, and to the north as far as James Bay, where they traded with the Cree and, later, the English. Their trade network to the east extended as far as present-day Quebec City, also on the Saint Lawrence. The Iroquoian-speaking Huron people lived nearby to the south. Archaeological evidence shows that the Nipissing integrated some Huron styles and techniques in their pottery. They obtained food primarily through hunting, fishing, and gathering. Their extensive trading likely allowed them to supplement their diets with corn, beans and squash as well, which were staple crops cultivated by many First Nations peoples. The land in the lake valleys would have supported some horticulture. Today Nipissing First Nation lies between the city of North Bay and the municipality of West Nipissing in northeastern Ontario. Most members of the First Nation reside on the First Nations reserve of Nipissing Indian Reserve 10. History Henry Hamilton. The Nipissing controlled trade routes that became increasingly desirable during the early French colonial period, as the French proved a large, lucrative market for the inland pelts, exporting many to Europe. The Iroquois, based south of Lake Ontario, conducted military campaigns against the competing Huron and Nipissing in the competition for furs. By 1647, the Nipissing regrouped in the Lake Nipigon area. The Nipissing continued to use their historical trade routes but at greater risk. Claude-Jean Allouez visited the Nipissings at Lake Nipigon 1667, but in 1671 he reported that the Nipissing had returned to Lake Nipissing. After returning to Lake Nipissing, some of the Nipissings relocated to the missions at Trois-Rivières and Oka, Quebec. The noted 18th-century Cherokee chief, Attakullakulla (died 1775) was born a Nipissing. He was captured as a child when the Cherokee raided his community and killed his parents; he was adopted by a Cherokee family. By the early 19th century, European Canadians and Métis had started trapping in the area in and around Lake Nipissing, rather than relying on pelts brought to trading posts by First Nations peoples. This competition resulted in fewer pelts available to the Nipissing and other First Nations in the area. In 1850 the Nipissing signed the Robinson Treaty with the Canadian representatives of the British Crown. In the face of increasing European encroachment by settlers, they wanted to confirm their claim to the north shores of Lake Nipissing and its main waterways. Reserve Nipissing 10, as it was formerly known, is an Indian reserve in northeastern Ontario located on the north shores of Lake Nipissing in the Nipissing District, serving as the land base for the Nipissing First Nation. The reserve is located west of North Bay and east of West Nipissing. The reserve comprises the communities of Beaucage, Jocko Point, Yellek, Duchesnay, and Garden Village, as well as many smaller sub-divisions. Garden Village is accessible by municipal streets in Sturgeon Falls. The other communities all have direct access off of Highway 17 West. Society Traditionally, the Nipissing nation is structured around families and clans (or doodems). The five doodems are: Blood (Miskwaa'aa, recorded as \\"Miskouaha\\"), Birchbark (Wiigwaas), Heron (Ashagi, recorded as \\"Outchougai\\"), Beaver (Amikwaa, recorded as \\"Amicois\\" or as \\"Nez Percez\\"), and Squirrel (Asanagoo). During the period of the clans' early contact with the Europeans, the Blood, Birchbark, and Squirrel clans were located on and about Lake Nipissing, the Heron clan resided primarily on Lake Nipissing but also on lands extending southward to the eastern coast of Lake Huron's Georgian Bay, and the Beaver clan was located on the northern coast of Georgian Bay, adjacent to Heron territory. Each clan is subdivided along family lines. They govern independently but at the same time cooperatively, as part of Nipissing Nation as a whole. They respect a person's right to decide individual paths.. Demographics As of February 2009, Nipissing First Nation had a total registered population of 2,201 people, of which 886 lived on their own reserve. The 2001 Canadian Census recorded 1,378 people lived on Nipissing 10 Indian Reserve. According to the 2011 Canadian Census:Census Profile *Population: 1,450 *% Change (2006-2011): 2.6 *Dwellings: 674 *Area (km²): 61.22 *Density (persons per km²): 23.7 Governance The current governance of the Nipissing First Nation is elected under the custom electoral system, consisting of a chief, deputy chief and six councillors. The current council consists of Chief Scott McLeod and Deputy Chief Muriel Sawyer, along with Councillors, June Commanda, Brian Couchie, Corey Goulais, Jane B Commanda, Michael Sawyer and Eric \\"Ric\\" Stevens. Their three-year term ends July 31, 2018. The Nipissing First Nation's council is a member of Waabnoong Bemjiwang Association of First Nations, which is a regional chiefs' council. The First Nation is also a member of the Union of Ontario Indians, a tribal political organization representing many of the Anishinaabe First Nations in central and southern Ontario. In January 2014, the Nipissing adopted what is believed to be the first constitution for First Nations in Ontario. It is supposed to replace the Indian Act as the supreme law which regulates the governance of the First Nation, but has not been tested in court.

His style combines Mediterranean world including Gypsy, Oriental and European cultures. He plays guitar, buzuq, mandolin and ’oud. Concert in Perpignan in September 2011 Biography Artistic debuts = Titi Robin, early in his career, performed at Arab and Gypsy community festivals that gave him the opportunity to test his musical approach. The musicians accompanying him are almost exclusively from minority groups (such as Berber Moroccan Abdelkrim Sami). =Beginnings= In 1984 he appeared (guitar, ‘oud and buzuq) in duet with Hameed Khan, an Indian tabla player originally from Jaipur. In 1987, he founded the \\"Johnny Michto\\" band, which combined Moroccan Berber rhythm with the electric buzuq, bass, clarinets and bagpipes. Although influenced by flamenco, mainly in its voice and poetic form, he has never directly performed it, preferring to exchange ideas with the artists of this musical form. =Les Trois Frères= Titi Robin while still with Hameed Khan, a duet which highlights melodic and rhythmic improvisational duels, meets Brittany singer, Erik Marchand, who incarnates in his opinion the rich traditional popular culture of Titi Robin's own home region. Together they develop a repertoire enlisting quarter-tones modes, Eastern modal improvisation based on taqsîm, and Gwerz, the ancient monophonic lamentation which the singer along with Yann fanch Kemener is at the time one of the heirs. Ocora Radio France commissioned a recording - \\"An Henchou Treuz\\" (1990) - which won the Grand Prix de l'Académie Charles Cros, a fitting beginning of the collaboration of the two duos that will eventually form the \\"Trio Erik Marchand\\", most of the repertoire composed and arranged by Titi Robin. This out of the ordinary formation - a Brittany singer, an Arabic lute player and an Indian tablâ specialist (for the record, it is their photography that illustrates the first article on \\"world music\\" in the Encyclopedia Universalis) - will travel internationally: from the Womad festivals to stages specialized in contemporary music, passing by the Théâtre de la Ville in Paris, Quartz in Brest, not to mention the jazz venues who acclaim their innovative approach to improvisation. Their international tours take them from Quebec to Houston, from Marrakech to Bir Zeit. The first album under the name of \\"Trio Erik Marchand\\" appeared in 1991: An Tri Breur (three brothers) (Silex). In the early 2000, the Trio Erik Marchand performed periodically, with Keyvan Chemirani at the percussions. =Gitans= This formation revealed Titi Robin mainly as an oudist (even if the particular instrument designed by his brother Patrick Robin and his personal playing style is intentionally quite different from classical Arabic oud). A disc released in January 1993 greatly clarified the world of the musician of the buzuq and guitar: The artist dedicates \\"Gitans\\" in homage to the Gypsy community from whom he learned so much. It is a mosaic of encounters between Titi Robin's favourite artists, who represent different branches of the family, from North India to Andalusia, and to the Balkans, from which he draws his personal musical vision. The repertoire mainly consists of original compositions and does not reproduce any typical gypsy style. He believes that the best tribute is to create something new and personal but which better demonstrates paradoxically the rich source honored here. Guest musicians include the following: Gulabi Sapera(vocals), Bruno el Gitano (vocals, palmas, guitar), Mambo Saadna (vocals, palmas, guitar), Paco el Lobo (vocals, palmas), François Castiello (accordion), Hameed Khan (tabla) Francis Alfred Moerman (guitar), Abdelkrim Sami (drums), Bernard Subert (clarinets, bagpipes). This release and the musical cooperation it required will attract a wide audience, bringing together both savvy aficionados and lovers of Mediterranean music. \\"Gitans\\" will tour in Japan, at the Hollywood Bowl (USA) and from South Africa up to the major European world music festivals. The theme \\"Petite mer\\", certainly the best known of the composer, comes from the disc. =Le Regard Nu= At the beginning of 1996, this group in a collective adventure, makes a radical thrust, coming out with an introspective instrumental recording, \\"Le Regard Nu\\" based on modal improvisation, as a result of a year of experimental research. Titi Robin was inspired by poses of female models, as in painting or sculpture, to nourish his musical improvisations on the solo ‘oud and buzuq. It is a series of musical tableaux. In the booklet, he cites Modigliani : “To work, I need a living being in front of me”. He is strongly inspired in his work by Jean- Pierre Montier's L’art sans l’art, which deals with the aesthetic vision of the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. The personality of the Iraqi oud player Munir Bashir, who according to Titi Robin \\"sculpts\\" silence and lets the present moment inhabit his improvisations, is very much present in the spirit of the musician's work. Starting from a specific traditional oriental technique, taqsîm, he approaches it more from a philosophical than a formal point of view resulting in an original iconoclastic style. In the same way American jazz has influenced improvisers from other cultures who than take there distance from the original model, Titi Robin has done the same with this aesthetic tradition. =Payo Michto & Kali Gadji= Tours of Gitans continue, as witnessed by the live album Payo Michto in 1997 (Francis Varis on the accordion). The voices are those of Saadna brothers from the \\"Rumberos Catalans\\" living in the district Saint Jacques (San Jaume) in Perpignan and Andalusian flamenco singer Paco el Lobo. The rhythmic style of Catalan rumba is important to Titi Robin, it crosses the sound of his gypsy guitar compass with nylon-string guitars. This is one of the emblematic colors of his universe. Here, we also listen to Brittany bagpiper Bernard Subert. Abdelkrim Sami is at the percussions and Gulabi Sapera brings her Rajasthani gypsy dance. In parallel, Titi Robin wants to find a way of forging links with contemporary Western popular music, which leads to a new formation, orchestrating the saxophone, drums and bass. It will be in Kali Gadji (1998) that the Gypsy and Oriental influences, always present, mingle with the French texts as well as with the polyrhythms of West Africa. From Morocco to Mali, passing by Mauritania, Titi Robin feels that history has linked these cultures to the great Mediterranean civilization. Musicians that are invited are Renaud Pion (saxophones), Abdelkrim Sami (vocals, percussions), Farid \\"Roberto\\" Saadna (vocals, guitar, palmas), Jorge \\"Negrito\\" Trasante (drums), Gabi Levasseur (accordion), Alain Genty (bass) and Bernard Subert (oboe, bagpipes). The orchestra has toured for many years in parallel with \\"Gitans\\" but did not have the same response from the public and critics. =Un Ciel de Cuivre= Ciel de Cuivre, released in 2000 is the album the artist considers the one that represents the diversity of his musical world the best. \\"I don’t know any other art school than the street and pleasure, because no one taught me how to speak this language but men and women crossed on my road and far from being all musicians. There is truth in the beauty of the deaf world, and I polished a mirror which may reflect this light: this gesture is the meaning of my music. As the saying Qawwal “thousands of times, I plunged myself into the river with no bottom but it is in a hole that I found the precious pearl.“ The real journey is inside. Music feeds itself in that inner source, deep in the heart, as the star, because there is no better elsewhere, or golden age in the past. Every day, under a sky of copper, we hit the road, a little more digging to find the bread, salt and the gold of the deep song.\\" Titi Robin (excerpt of the text presenting the disc). Fifteen musicians are invited such as Farid \\"Roberto\\" Saadna, Gulabi Sapera, Keyvan Chemirani, François Laizeau, Renaud Pion, Negrito Trasante, Francis-Alfred Moerman. A sextet toured continuously offering themes from this disc mixed with older compositions. The Titi Robin Trio (‘oud, guitar, buzuq / accordion / percussion) drawing across exclusively Titi’s instrumental repertoire also produce a lot abroad, especially in the Middle East (Iraq, Jordan, Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Palestine...). =Titi Robin and Gulabi Sapera= Since 1992, Titi Robin regularly worked with Gulabi Sapera to whom he dedicated a book \\"Gulabi Sapera, danseuse Gitane du Rajasthan\\" (2000, Naive/Acte Sud). She tells her legendary life in Rajasthan, a nomad young lady who goes from the miserable life of snake charmers camps to national and then international recognition. She is frequently invited to Titi's shows and the song Pundela from the disc \\"Gitans\\" just like the song \\"La rose de Jaipur\\" from the album \\"Ciel de cuivre\\", shows how much emotion there is between the two artists when they meet. In 2002, they released an album co-signed Rakhî dedicated to the marriage of their respective universe, based on songs from the Kalbeliya’s caste or the Marwari repertoire from the Thar desert. \\"Her choreography and Titi Robin's compositions gather round a show Jivula which sees the day in September 2002, and is announced on many French and international scenes, enjoying a light show of Pascale Paillard. In 2006, the DVD Jivula and CD Anita! (Madoro Music / Naïve) are released, including several documentary films by Sergio Mondelo presenting Titi Robin's universe, from an Andalusian trip to the grave of singer Camaron de la Isla, featuring interviews and archival footage, music scenes extracts and family, the music and dance creation of Titi Robin and Gulabi Sapera, filmed in India and France. (The live record entitled Anita! regroups stage interpretations from the fall of 2005, recorded and mixed by Guillaume Dubois assisted by Jerome Musiani with a Louis Vincent's booklet). The collaboration with this dancer from Rajasthan ended in 2007. It lasted fifteen years. =Alezane et ses vagues= In 2002, the composer created the entire soundtrack of the Manuel Boursinhac’s film La Mentale (soundtrack Naïve). He then took up the challenge of responding to a commission (to accompany a film with music) exclusively using elements of his own musical style. In 2004, to celebrate his 20 years of career, the anthology Alezane was released as a double disc with a rich booklet designed by painter and graphic artist Eric Roux-Fontaine. Alezane is a selection of Titi's recordings presented as two thematic CDs: Le jour offers rhythmic dance tracks, La Nuit, more intimate songs, embellished with unpublished ones, including a couple of remixed versions and reinterpreted songs. In 2005, two sets of Parisian productions took place: four nights at the Bouffes du Nord in February, five nights at the Cabaret Sauvage in November, on the occasion of the release of the new album: Ces vagues que l’amour soulève (Naïve, October 2005). While the recording sessions of previous records were often the opportunity to invite many musicians with whom Titi Robin did not necessarily tour on stage, but were ideally suited to the interpretation of one or more songs. He invited this time a more limited group of musicians, who were largely similar to those around him during the shows. Foremost is the faithful trio (Francis Varis on accordion, Kalou Stalin on bass and Ze Luis Nascimento on percussion) that accompanies him all year in Jivula (The musical and choreographic creation of Titi Robin and Gulabi Sapera), the quintet and trio, he wished omnipresent in this disc. Cantaor flamenco singer Jose Montealegre, who sings in the quintet came to enrich a suite written around the oud. The Saadna brothers (Los Rumberos Catalans), with whom he played for many years, joined him to end the disc in gypsy festivities. During the composing of the soundtrack of Manuel Boursinhac's film, for the first time, there was a string orchestra, mainly consisting of composed of violas, cellos and basses (based on the arrangements of Renaud Gabriel Pion). Titi Robin has extended this present experience thanks to arrangements of Francis Varis on three themes. That same year, the formation \\"En famille\\" appeared, gathering around Gulabi Sapera and Titi Robin a new generation: Maria, Colombe “La Coque” and Dino Banjara. Maria, singing, and La Coque, at the percussions, also joined in the studio for the recording of this album. In 2005, Titi Robin composed (assisted by Silvio Soave who is his sound engineer since the early 1990s) the soundtrack of Florence Quentin’s film OLE!(Naïve). Amongst the abundant tours of the artist in France and abroad, he was invited by Alain Bashung during his carte blanche at the Cité de la Musique in June. The two musicians met on several occasions in 2006, showing a great relationship and mutual respect. =Encounters= At the invitation of Philippe Conrath for the Africolor festival, Titi Robin and the Reunion poet-singer Danyel Waro, emblematic figure of the Maloya, conceived a program reuniting their two artistic universes. This concert called Michto Maloya was to be unique but responding to many request from organizers, took the road from the winter of 2006 to the summer of 2007 for three big tours: Transmusicales of Rennes, Sakifo festival in Reunion through \\"Jazz sous les pommiers\\" in Coutances, theater Bouffes du Nord in Paris... In June, Titi Robin participated in the Gnawa Festival in Essaouira (Morocco), with Kalou Stalin and Ze Luis Nascimento. They performed in trio and also presented a concert with Maâlem Abdenbi el Gadari. For the musician, this was an emotional homecoming, since Moroccan music and Gnawa music in particular existed in his debuts. In August 2006, the original and memorable stage meeting between Titi Robin and Qawwal Lahore, Faiz Ali Faiz (escales de St Nazaire) took place which later evolved in 2009 with a new creation during the Festival de Saint Denis, with a record, Jaadu and also many international concerts. Titi composed on this occasion an entirely original melodic repertoire in the service of the Sufi poetry of qawwali. This mystical culture, through song, rhythm and poetry was dear to the heart of the artist and very popular in Rajasthan India, where he was often present alongside Gulabi Sapera. In March 2007, the new CD from the \\"La Reine des Gitans\\" Esma Redzepova, the voice of the Roma in the Balkans, comes out with the participation of Titi Robin (Accords Croisés). A series of concerts to celebrate the release of the album takes place in Paris (New Morning) and Arles (Suds Festival). In December 2007, for the 800th anniversary of the birth of the Sufi poet Rumi, Titi Robin presents an original creation at the Theatre Gerard Philippe in Saint Denis, focusing on poetry, however leaving a large part to the daf, an Iranian frame- drum, used among others, in the Sufi rituals. The Iranian Kurdish musician Shadi Fathi counselled the musician on the adaptations in French poetry and wrote the parts for the daf sections, accompanied by Colombe Robin \\"La Coque\\". The reciters are Esmail (Persian) and Soeuf Elbadawi (French), and other musicians are Renaud Pion (wind) and Keyvan Chemirani (zarb). =Kali Sultana= Trio and quintet concerts (with either Pepito Montealegre or Maria Robin singing) continue to tour. Titi Robin toured in India from north to south in October 2008 with his trio (he frequently tours on the sub-continent) and writes on this occasion, a daily blog at the request of the website of Radio France Internationale(RFI). This entire article is still available. Kali Sultana, l’ombre du ghazal (\\"the shadow of the ghazal\\") is released in the fall 2008, a new project both discographic and scenic. A long suite arranged in two parts, seven movements and three interludes, this river of an album is a double-CD. > « It has the power and flow of a lyric and epic poem. Melodic and rhythmical > motifs follow on from one another, answer each other and expound on each > other, united by the free inspiration of music which abolishes any distance > between improvisation and the written tradition, individual expression and > collective dynamics, the fervour of dance and meditative introspection, a > commitment to the real world and the aspiration of dreams. As ever in Titi > Robin’s music, these motifs weave the outline of a story, in which it is > Kali Sultana (the “Black Queen”), who this time takes the pride of place. > She is the feminine incarnation of grace, an ideal of beauty that every > artist pursues; she is the universal, imaginary and yet ubiquitous muse, > whose indescribable and elusive splendour every artist dreams of embracing. > » (Excerpt from the presentation of the album). A tour in 2009 follows that includes a string section (two violas and cello), and the Renaud Pion returning to the winds. This concert takes over two hours all parts being linked without a break. During 2009, Gitans is released in an English version in the United Kingdom. During the summer, at the initiative of Brahim el Mazned and Patrice Bulting, he met Moroccan gumbri player, Majid Bekkas with whom he put on an original show for the two festivals of Agadir and Saint-Nazaire. Participants included percussionist Minino Garay and ribab player Foulane Bouhssine (Mazagan). For his first concert in Mali in Bamako in May 2011, Titi Robin was welcomed on stage by great musical figures such as Toumani Diabate, Oumou Sangare and Bassekou Kouyaté who all came to welcome him publicly and interpret a few songs with him for the occasion. Cheick Tidiane Seck is also present in the room. The Malian style of string playing seems close to the musician's own universe (it still captures the musical continuity from the Arab Andalusia to Mauritania and Mali) and he had already composed for the album Kali Gadji a tribute to singer Oumou Sangare. He also invited her on stage at La Cigale in Paris in 2000. In return, she organized an evening in honor of Titi Robin and his band in Bamako. =Sur Les Rives= From late 2009 to 2011, Titi Robin worked on his triptych Les Rives, a long- term project that is close to his heart: producing a recording in each of these three countries, India, Turkey and Morocco, around his repertoire with local musicians. This local CD production destined for a local public was a way to repay the cultures that had influenced him, something he considered his duty. As a second step, the three CDs are grouped together for a European and international distribution. In parallel with these record productions, Titi Robin has not stopped touring in France and internationally. Nominated for the \\"Victoires de la Musique\\" in 2012 in the category \\"World Music\\", he seized the opportunity to publish a very critical stand on such a media event: > «...In my career, I have carefully avoided any competition. First and > foremost, in the act of creation, there is no price, no trade, no > competition. The aesthetic quest is the only motive...» The release of the compilation Les Rives at a concert at the Arab World Institute in Paris in November 2011, brought together a new formation with Murad Ali Khan (sarangi), Sinan Çelik (kaval), El Mehdi Nassouli (guembri, vocals), Ze Luis Nascimento (drums) and Francis Varis (accordion). The orchestra has performed regularly on stage since 2012 and 2013. In July 2011, he presented in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and New Delhi a quartet composed around him, Murad Ali Khan (sarangi), Vinay Mishra (harmonium) and Ninayat Netke (tabla) for the release of his Indian record Laal Asmaan. Musical style Robin builds his work through: * compositions, which are spread over thirty years already (his style has not changed, so much so that he used for example, in 2008, among the compositions of Kali Sultana, two themes composed in the late 1970s, and it is difficult to detect any stylistic difference. \\"The truth is I do not know why this style has been given to me, but I work constantly to fit and polish it\\"). * interpretations and improvisations that evolve because, as in the compositions, his life and his heart are made of \\"experiences which are those of a man's life with all it includes: joys, suffering, broken dreams and sometimes fortunate discoveries.\\" His mastery of instruments and orchestration is also enriched by experience. * stage performances that take on, from different angles, always the same universe, making sure that these different lightings give a sense to his quest. The very different and complementary pleasures of solitude and solo playing, and society and festive improvisations form this orchestral approach. * recordings, that he considers completely apart from concerts (live discs appear to be concessions to his friends), \\"like books or paintings, in which those that acquire them savor their way in ten years on either side of the earth, these recordings in the same way are appropriated as a book with the same degree of privacy.

The T140 was the second generation in the Bonneville series developed from the earlier T120 Bonneville and was produced by Triumph in a number of versions, including limited editions, from 1973 until 1983 when the company was declared bankrupt. Licensed production of the T140 Bonneville was continued by Les Harris between 1985 and 1988 at Newton Abbot in Devon, these machines became known as 'Harris' or 'Devon' Bonnevilles. A single carburettor version, the TR7 Tiger was produced between 1973 and 1981. History The 650 cc capacity production T120 Bonneville was replaced in the early 1970s by the T140 Bonneville, the same basic machine but with a 750 cc engine. Refined from the later 'oil in frame' version of the T120, the first few T140s, designated T140V, featured a larger-capacity engine of 724 cc, a five-speed gearbox and indicators, but still retaining drum brakes and kick-start. Shortly after, the engine was further bored out to 744 cc and front disc brakes were fitted (using single discs until 1982). While originally intended for 'export only'Triumph Engineering Co.Ltd Meridian (December 1972). Motor Cycle Mechanics (December) the 750 Bonneville twin, caused so much interest among visitors to the 1973 motorcycle shows, that Triumph decided to put the bike on the home market at the price of 679 uk pounds.Triumph Engineering Co.Ltd (April 1973). Motor Cycle Mechanics. No. April. In 1975, along with engine modifications, the gearchange lever was moved from right to left to comply with new regulations mandated for the American market and a rear disc brake fitted. Several T140 models followed featuring various modifications and refinements including electric starting from 1980 until production ceased with the closure of the Meriden works in 1983. Although this should have been the end of the Bonneville, as it turned out it was not. Triumph Motorcycles was acquired by businessman John Bloor, who licensed a company called Racing Spares in Devon, run by Les Harris to manufacture the T140 Bonneville. These continuation bikes are known as the 'Devon Bonnevilles', which did not reach the market until 1985, and were not sold in the U.S. Production ended in 1988. =The Bonneville name= The Bonneville name came from the achievements of Texas racer Johnny Allen on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in the 1950s. The model designation of T140 continued the numbering system started by Edward Turner in 1937 with the Triumph Tiger 70, a number that was intended to advertise the machine's top speed in miles per hour. DesignEngine= Detail of a T140E Bonneville engine The T140 uses a 360-degree, air-cooled parallel twin layout. Gear driven camshafts operate a single inlet and exhaust valve in each cylinder via pushrods. Twin Amal carburettors supply the cylinders with fuel/air mixture through short intake manifolds. The crankshaft drives the clutch through a triplex chain operating in an oil bath. Starting is by kick start with later versions having electric start. The engine oil system is of the dry sump type, a combined pressure and scavenge oil pump is driven by the inlet camshaft gear, later versions of the T140 employed additional integral non-return valves to prevent oil draining into the sump. The frame of the T140 serves as the engine oil reservoir. =Transmission= The T140 uses a five-speed sequential gearbox, the gear shafts are removable from the right side of the engine without the need to split the crankcases. The clutch is of the wet, multiple-disc coil spring type and is cable operated. The gearbox is splash lubricated by its own oil contents. Early models featured a right mounted gear change lever with all later models (from August 1975) featuring a left mounted gear lever. A shock absorbing or \\"cush drive\\" system for the chain final drive consisting of rubber blocks is unusually mounted in the clutch centre. =Chassis= The frame of the T140 is manufactured from mild steel tube and uses a 'duplex' layout. Twin rear adjustable shock absorbers provide suspension through a swinging arm, sprung and oil-damped front telescopic forks are used. The 19 inch diameter front wheel and 18 inch rear wheel were spoked with optional cast alloy wheels available from 1979 onwards. The under-seat area is occupied by the battery and ignition coils. From 1976, the T140 had hydraulic disc brakes for both the front and rear wheels. Prior to that date, early versions were equipped with a conical hub rear drum brake. A single leading shoe rear drum brake was specified for the last Bonnevilles proposed by the Meriden factory in 1984 but the factory closed before production. From 1982, twin front brake discs were available as an option. =Electrical system= The T140 features a standard Lucas 12 volt electrical system, early models were positive earth with a change to negative earth from 1979 onwards. Zener diodes are used for voltage regulation. Early engines used contact breaker point ignition with electronic ignition becoming standard fitment on all Triumph's 750cc twins from 1979-on. Early models 1973-1980 Note on country specifications: =T140V= Lightly customised 1976 Triumph Bonneville T140V with aftermarket handlebars, mufflers, side panels and paint scheme The initial model of the T140 line was the 'V', which stood for five-speed transmission which was a Quaife design. Developed from the Bonneville T120 by Brian Jones, the T140V was launched in 1973 in response to a decline in sales of the T120. The introduction of the Japanese four-cylinder Honda CB750 had been noted by the Triumph management board in the late 1960s, the three-cylinder 750 cc BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident was developed to directly compete against it. The first model shared many of the T120's cycle parts and largely the same twin-cylinder engine bored out to , but this was quickly increased to . The cylinder head required an extra mounting stud to prevent gasket failure due to the decreased distance between the cylinder bores, the gearbox components were strengthened (compared to the T120) and were further modified when gear selection problems became apparent. A hydraulic disc brake replaced the outdated cable-operated drum brake for the front wheel. Problems with vibration meant that sales were slow, however, and production was heavily disrupted by the workers' occupation of the Meriden factory in 1973. Even once this dispute was resolved, the 1974 production T140s suffered from quality control problems, but these were resolved once the workers' co-operative became established. =T140J Silver Jubilee= Triumph Bonneville Jubilee 1977 The 1977 T140J was launched as a limited edition of 1,000 in US and an additional 1,000 in UK specification (plus 400 for Commonwealth export) of the T140V, produced to commemorate the 1977 Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The idea originated with Lord Stokes who was Chairman of British Leyland and working as a consultant to the Meriden Co-operative. A silver finish with red and blue lining was used and was matched by a blue saddle with red beading. Primary drive, taillight housing and timing covers were chrome-plated and the wheel rim centres were painted and lined. US-version side panels had \\"One of a Thousand\\" written under Union Jack flag stickers, UK-version side panels had \\"Limited Edition\\", while the remaining 400 Commonwealth export bikes were badged \\"International Edition\\". Quickly established as a collectors item, each machine was supplied with a unique certificate of ownership. =T140E= T140E in US specification with optional Morris alloy wheels Launched in 1978, the letter 'E' stood for emissions compliant. This model featured a new cylinder head, redesigned Amal carburettors to meet emission regulations and shortly after production started, Lucas electronic ignition. Most 'E' models had many design improvements including new Lucas switchgear, new side panel design and passenger grabrails that incorporated a small parcel rack. There was also a 1980 T140E 'Executive' Special Edition with Sigma hard luggage, a Brearley- Smith 'Sabre' cockpit fairing and special two-tone paint. =T140D Special= US specification T140D Bonneville Special Launched in 1979 and designed by Triumph's Tom Higham, the Triumph T140D Bonneville Special was a styling exercise inspired by the Yamaha XS 650 Special. Several T140D features such as the top-mounted rear disc caliper and revised grabrail became standard on the T140E. The Bonneville Specials were finished in gold-pinstriped black with a stepped seat and seven-spoke US-made Lester mag-alloy wheels and a tuned two- into-one exhaust for the US market. The T140D had polished fork sliders and a shortened chrome mudguard fixed in place by its central bracing strip. =T140ES Electro= The Bonneville T140ES was the electric start or 'Electro' Bonneville. Launched in 1980 and designed at Meriden by Brian Jones, the electric starter was fitted at the rear of the timing chest where the magneto had been located on the original 1959 Bonneville T120. Optional on all Triumph models following its introduction upon the 'Executive', electric starting was however standard on all Royal Wedding, T140AV, TSS and TSX models. Late models 1981-1983T140AV= Designed by Brian Jones and Bernard Hooper Engineering, the Bonneville T140AV, initially for police use featured an anti- vibration system, the swing arm being pivoted and attached to the engine, which was itself isolated on rubber mounts from the chassis. Engine balance was also revised. Also produced in 'Executive', TSS as well as TR7V Tiger forms, the T140AV was built between 1981 and 1983. =T140LE Royal Wedding= 1981 T140LE Royal Wedding Bonneville in UK/RoW specification exhibited at the London Motorcycle Museum The T140LE stood for 'Limited Edition' and each came with an owner's certificate signed by the dealer and chairman of Triumph. Just 250 'Royal Wedding' Bonnevilles (with special finishes for the 125 US and 125 UK models) were built to commemorate the 1981 marriage of Lady Diana Spencer and Charles, Prince of Wales. The UK version had a silver-grey painted frame and black finished engine whilst the export version had grey seat top covers and a highly polished engine with silver painted barrels. Whilst both had electric starting, Bing carburettors, ULO turn indicators and Marzocchi Strada gas-oil rear shock absorbers as standard, the UK version also had American- made 'Morris' alloy wheels and twin front discs. Both versions' petrol tanks were chromed but finished differently: the 4 gallon UK tank featured a plain Triumph badge with black scallops echoing the side panel colour; the 2 gallon export tank had the old 'picture frame' Triumph badge and had gold-lined, 'smoked' blue scallops that matched the side panel colour. The fixing point for both types of tank to the frame was covered by a badge that read \\"Royal Wedding 1981\\" whilst both side panels bore the legend, 'Bonneville', 'Royal' and '1981' with stylised Prince of Wales's feathers, symbol of the Prince of Wales . There were also Royal Bonnevilles exported to the United States to the specification of Triumph Motorcycles America. These were like UK Royals but with black frames and gold-lined, black tanks. The stylised Prince Of Wales's feathers on their side panel badges were retained next to the word 'Royal' but the '1981' date was deleted. Their engines were finished in black like the UK version but with polished covers like the US version. =T140W TSS= Close up of rare 1983 TSS-AV showing 8 valve cylinder head, electric start, rear set footrests and anti-vibration frame The electric-starting Triumph T140W TSS was launched in 1982 and featured an eight-valve cylinder head (derived from Weslake Engineering, hence the 'W' suffix) and a revised crankshaft designed to reduce vibration. All T140W had an electric start, the new Italian-made 4-gallon petrol tank, twin front disc brakes and Marzocchi Strada rear shock absorbers as standard with Morris alloy wheels and an anti-vibration frame as options. Whilst the UK/Rest of World kept the Amal Mk2 types as found on the standard 4 valve T140E, the US version had German- designed Bing carburettors that Amal made under licence in Spain. For 1983/4, it was envisaged, in line with the UK/Rest of World range, that the TSS-AV would also be fitted with the anti-vibration frame, rear-set footrests, a new seat-tail unit and TSX-style side panels all as standard. =T140 TSX= Triumph TSX. Note absence of kick starter. Designed by Wayne Moulton of Triumph Motorcycles America, the Triumph T140 TSX was a custom-styled T140ES with a 16-inch (41 cm) rear wheel, Morris alloy wheels, stepped seat, special finish and parts. This was the only Bonneville designed by an American and to rely upon decals rather than paint to add colour. The kick starter was an optional extra as were twin front disc brakes. This version of the T140 was one of the last produced, introduced in June 1982. =T140EX Executive= The EX Executive Bonneville, available in smoked colours of burgundy or blue and also black, all gold-lined, had a Sabre 'cockpit' fairing by Brearley-Smith and full hard 'Executive' luggage by Sigma. A full fairing similar to that fitted to police models was available as an option. Triumph's electric start system was introduced on this model. Les Harris Bonneville Triumph T140 Bonneville built under licence by LF Harris with significantly more Italian and German component parts. In 1984 the T140 production rights were licensed by the new owner of Triumph, John Bloor, to Devon-based engineer Les Harris who produced 1,300 complete motorcycles at his Newton Abbot factory between 1985 and 1988 when the licence was not renewed . These machines were distinct from the Meriden product having as standard, German Magura switchgear, Merit spark plug caps with Italian Paioli front and rear suspension, Brembo brakes and Lafranconi silencers. TR7 Tiger A single carburettor version of the T140 known as the TR7 Tiger was produced between 1973 and 1980. The TR7RV (later TR7V) was introduced as the single carburettor version of the T140V. In 1981 an off-road version, the TR7T Tiger Trail was produced.  Media  An early T140E was Richard Gere's motorcycle in the 1982 romantic drama film An Officer and a Gentleman. The same motorcycle, then the property of Paramount pictures, was used in the Judd Nelson thriller Blue City. A T140 was also disguised as an earlier Bonneville T120 for another of Richard Gere's rides in his later film Mr. Jones. Prior to these movies, Richard Gere himself also bought a Bonneville from Triumph with his pay from the touring production of the musical Grease in the 1970s. Australian film Garage Days prominently features a mildly customised late T140E from the early 1980s. 1973 T140V Bonnevilles featured prominently in Hollywood blaxploitation biker film The Black Six and could be seen in Race with the Devil with later models making occasional appearances in contemporary television series such as CHiPS and The Sweeney. Film and television appearances of the T140 Bonneville continued even in the late 1980s and 1990s after production ended, such as in Melrose Place, The Kids in the Hall, Sweet Angel Mine, The Fourth Protocol and even the 1999 Swedish movie Tsatsiki, morsan och polisen. A 1979 T140E Bonneville also featured in Elton John's 1983 promotional video for his song \\"Kiss the Bride\\". On his album Euroman Cometh, Jean-Jacques Burnel had his T140 rev its engine during the performance of the song \\"Triumph (Of the Good City)\\", something that was repeated at live performances.

History The AMEC had been formed in 1816 when a number of black congregations banded together under the leadership of Richard Allen, and by the mid-1850s it had seven conferences in the United States. AMEC preachers began to work in Upper Canada in 1834, and a conference was formed in 1840. In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in the United States causing some ex- slave AMEC preachers in the United Canadas to be fearful of attending conferences in the U.S. Reverend Benjamin Stewart of Chatham, Ontario proposed that the AME churches in the United Canadas separate from the U.S. association and form their own church. At an AME conference the new church was named the British Methodist Episcopal Church in appreciation of finding a safe haven from slavery in British North America. In Philadelphia in 1856, Stewart's proposal was adopted and the new church association was founded. Reverend Augustus R. Green, later BME Bishop Green (though he is reported as being thrown out of the Church when he and colleagues later challenged Nazrey, whereupon they began the Independent Methodist Episcopal Church), publisher and editor of the True Royalist and Weekly Intelligencer was also a part of this movement. Its first bishop was Reverend Willis Nazrey of Virginia. When Nazrey died in 1875, Richard Randolph Disney was chosen as his successor, and he was ordained by an AMEC bishop that year. His administrative area consisted of Ontario, Nova Scotia, Bermuda, the West Indies, and British Guiana (Guyana). By the end of the 1870s the BMEC had 56 congregations with about 3,100 members, most of its members being in the Danish West Indies and British Guiana. However, the mission work outside Canada stretched the church's funds, and in 1880 Disney negotiated a reunion with the AMEC, which was ratified at a BMEC convention held at Hamilton in June 1881. A referendum of members showed that although a majority in Ontario was opposed, 86 per cent of the membership was in favour. Disney was accepted as an AMEC bishop and was assigned to its Tenth Episcopal District, a region embracing his former territory and some of the AMEC churches in Canada that had not joined the BMEC. A majority of the Ontario churches and preachers, led by the Reverend Walter Hawkins of Chatham, sought to re-establish the BMEC. This group feared the loss of their distinctive identity, and may have been concerned that the opinions of Ontario members had been overwhelmed by those of the Caribbean groups. In 1886 this group held an ecclesiastical council at Chatham, at which it was claimed that Disney had defected to the AMEC. At a subsequent general conference that year the BMEC was reconstituted. The conference deposed Disney, agreeing to \\"erase his name and ignore his authority, and cancel his official relationship as bishop.\\" The reconstituted BMEC elected Hawkins as its general superintendent, avoiding the title of bishop for several years. Disney continued with what was left of his AMEC district until 1888, when he was transferred to Arkansas and Mississippi. By 1898 the BMEC had 27 preaching points and 25 preachers, the AMEC 130 churches in Canada. The two denominations continue their separate work to this day. Modern day S.R. Drake Memorial Church in Brantford, ON The BME church has seen a major decline in membership over the years, resulting in many closures. In 1985, the BME church in Woodstock, Ontario, Hawkins Chapel, shut its doors and was converted into a single-family home. The BME church of Collingwood followed a similar fate in 1990. In 2003, the North Buxton congregation broke with the church - choosing to operate as an independent community church instead. The most recent church to close its doors was in Guelph in 2011. The former BME building was put up for sale, and purchased by the Guelph Black Heritage Society in 2012. Although now closed, other BME churches existed in Stratford, Fort Erie, Queen's Bush, Puce (Lakeshore), Simcoe, Ingersoll, Dresden, and Harrow.

He became an independent Sultan of North Bengal from 1255 CE to 1257 CE. As governor Yuzbak was appointed Governor of Bengal after Masud Jani was unable to defeat the forces delegated by Emperor Narasingha Deva I of Eastern Ganga for four years. In 1254, he invaded the Azmardan Raj (present- day Ajmiriganj) in northeast Bengal and managed to defeat the local Raja. In 1255, Yuzbak succeeded in repulsing Emperor Narasingha's forces, led by the emperor's son-in-law Savantar, away from south-western Bengal. After capturing Mandaran in western Bengal, Yuzbak fixed the border between the two empires at the Damodar River. As independent Sultan Following the recapture of Mandaran and southwestern Bengal, he signed a treaty of alliance with Narasingha and declared himself independent of the Delhi Sultanate. He styled himself as Sultan Mughithuddin Abul Muzaffar Iuzbak and struck coins in his own name. As an independent Sultan, Yuzbak had control over much of northern and northwestern Bengal with his capital in Lakhnauti. By 1256, he captured Bihar and Awadh from Delhi rule with his own army and war-boats, thus extending his powerful domain. =Defeat= In 1257, Yuzbak commenced an expedition to the Kamrup region and Koch Hajo, both in present-day Assam. There, Yuzbak and his forces were faced by the battalion of Sandhya, the erstwhile Rai of Kamrup in Kamarupanagara. With the help of the seasonal spring floods, Sandhya defeated and captured Yuzbak and had him executed in due course. Following the execution, Yuzbak's domain was split into two with Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga breaking the alliance and taking over the areas he had lost. Yuzbak's fellow tribesman, Ijjauddin Balban Iuzbaki, succeeded him as Governor of Bengal for the Delhi Sultanate.

History In 1998, founder Alexandre Martinat began broadcasting a weekly program on Saturday nights, and assembled a team to turn the show into a 24-hour radio station. Frequence3 was founded by this group on 15 April 2001, on the basis of an initial webradio called \\"Europe3\\". It was later renamed Fréquence3, as the first name was already registered. At that time, only 30 listeners could listen to the station at once. In 2002, the station developed technically with the addition of new servers for more users to listen, and a mobile antenna to cover events outside the studio, and had its first guests. The Frequence3 operation relocated to France from Belgium. Frequence3 was a leading organisation in the launch of the National Association of France Webradios on 14 March 2006, to promote recognition of the medium. On 21 June 2006, Frequence3 launched a second music stream, \\"F3 - Only 90's\\", with a program consisting solely of music from the 1990s. On 17 October 2006, Frequency3 began national distribution, beyond its broadcast via Frequence3.fr, through channel 99 on the proposed Freebox service. In January 2007, Nicolas Moulin, Secretary since 2005, replaced Alexandre Martinat as President of Frequence3. Since 15 February 2007, Frequence3 has been broadcasting the radio program of the Paris Graduate School of Journalism (ESJ), \\"Frequence ESJ\\", which includes university information. On 3 March 2007, the station united all of its activities into larger premises at the ESJ Paris. On 2 July 2007, Alexandre Martinat resigned from his post as director of air.

He served as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) from 1896 to 1914. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate from Vermont in 1914, losing to incumbent Republican senator William P. Dillingham. Early life Charles Azro Prouty was born on October 9, 1853 in Newport, Vermont to John Azro Prouty and Hannah Barker Lamb. In 1875, Prouty graduated at the top of his class at Dartmouth College. He worked briefly at the Alleghany City Observatory in Pennsylvania, but ill health forced his return to Vermont, where he studied law with Theophilus Grout and was admitted to the bar in 1877. Vermont businessman and politician Prouty was twice elected State's Attorney of Orleans County (1882 and 1884), and in 1888 he won a term in the Vermont House of Representatives. He served as principal of Newport Academy for two years. From 1888 to 1896, Prouty served as Reporter of Decisions for the Vermont Supreme Court. He also helped to found the Orleans Trust Company and the Newport Electric Company. He served as general counsel for the Rutland and Central Vermont Railroads.

Prouty was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, and was sworn in on December 21 to serve an unexpired term ending in 1901. President Theodore Roosevelt reappointed him in 1901 and in 1907. Prouty served a one-year term, elected by his fellow commissioners, as Chairman of the Commission from 1912-1913. While on the Commission, he urged Congress to increase regulation of railroad rates, and allow the Commission to value railroad property. When Congress finally passed the Valuation Act in 1913, Prouty resigned, effective in 1914, to become the Commission's first Director of Valuation. Prouty ran for Senator from Vermont in 1914, but lost to incumbent Republican Senator William P. Dillingham. Prouty had received the endorsement of the Prohibition and Progressive parties, while failing to win the Democratic nomination at the state Democratic convention. When Democratic nominee Charles D.

History The Province of Bengal, under the governorship of Tughral Tughan Khan, was invaded by Odia armies in the year 1241. After the Province was overrun, the Sultanate Governor of Oudh, Tughlaq Tamar Khan, was appointed to lead a relief army to Bengal to aid Tughan Khan however at Darbhanga on the border of Bengal and Bihar, the Tamar Khan attempted to depose Tughan Khan himself.KingListsFarEast Though unable to slay his rival, Tamar Khan was able to drive him from the Province and gain control of both the Sultanate armies of Bengal and Oudh by bribing the remaining generals. In 1246, Tamar Khan finally entered Bengal where, aided by a revolt of local Zamindars, he was able to take control of the old capital of Devkot. However his attempts to rebuild the Navy were defeated. At the Siege of Lakhnauti, formerly sacked by the Odia armies in 1242, Tamar Khan's forces was repelled. In 1247 Tamar Khan died of a fever upon which North Bengal was reconquered by the Odia general, Paramardi Dev. Tamar Khan's death would lead to the appointment of lkhtiyar-ud-Din Yuzbak as Governor of Bengal, which would lead to the rebellion of Tughan Khan in 1272 CE.

He governed Bengal during 1236-1246 CE and again during 1272-1281 CE. Biography He was a Turkic of Khitan origin and was a slave-officer bought by Sultan Iltutmish. He was the given the iqta' of Badayun before being appointed the Governor of Bihar by the Sultan in 1232 as Saifuddin Aibak had been transferred to Lakhnauti. Following the death of Iltutmish, assassination of Saifuddin Aibak and the subsequent ascension of the rebel usurper Awar Khan Aibak, Tughan invaded Bengal and successfully defeated Awar Khan in 1236. Immediately after assuming power, Tughan Khan led a number of expeditions. He established his dominance throughout Bengal, Bihar and Oudh while staying loyal to the Delhi Sultanate. He conquered Tirhut in September 1242. He advanced westwards towards Kara, where he got news of the ascension of Sultan Ala ud din Masud. In 1242, he ordered his treasurer Mubarak Khan al-Khazan to construct a building in southern Bihar. Tughral is referred to as \\"Majlis Ali, the great Khan, the exalted Khaqan, honour of the Truth and the Religion, helper of princes and sultans, patriarch of victory, Tughril the Sultani\\" (). The inscription stating this is preserved in Bihar Museum. During the reign of Tughan Khan, the Hindu king of Orissa, Narasimhadeva I, invaded southern Bengal. Tughan Khan repulsed the Oriya army and captured the Katasin fort of Orissa. But when the Muslim army was celebrating its victory, the Oriya soldiers attacked and defeated them. The Oriya army pursued the Muslims all the way to Lakhnauti, the capital of Bengal, and besieged the city. All the Muslims of Lakhnauti were slain. Tughan Khan sought assistance from the Delhi sultan, Alauddin Masud Shah, who sent Malik Karakash Khan of Kara and Malik Tughlaq Tamar Khan of Oudh to help Tughan Khan. Hearing the approach of the Delhi army, the Oriya army retreated to Orissa. But Tughlaq Tamar Khan himself assumes the power of Bengal which forced Tughan Khan to flee to Delhi. Thus Tughan Khan's ten year ruling of Bengal ended in 1246 CE.KingListsFarEast Tughan Khan was later appointed as the governor of Oudh by Sultan Alauddin Masud Shah. Second term (1272-1281) In 1272 Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban appointed Amin Khan as the governor and Tughan Khan as the sub-governor of Bengal with the duty to reconquer and pacify the Province, most of which had been under the control of the Eastern Ganga dynasty since the death of Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak in 1257 CE. However Tughan Khan deposed Amin Khan with the help of his old loyalists and declared himself Sultan of Bengal. He took the name Mughisuddin Tughral. In 1279, Tughan Khan defeated the Sena king Vishwarup Sen of eastern Bengal (present-day Assam) and established an Islamic feifdom in that region for the first time in history. He res-established the Bengali Navy, destroyed in 1243 by Narasimhadeva I at the Fort Narikella at Sonargaon. In 1280, Tughan Khan took advantage of a drought to invade South Bengal and then, Jajnagar (present-day Orissa). Taking advantage of Tughan Khan's absence, Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban sent a huge army led by Malik Turmati the ruler of Oudh against Tughan. But the Delhi army was thoroughly defeated by Tughan's army. Balban sent another army against Tughan. But this time once again Balban's army was defeated by Tughan's army. Infuriated by repeated defeats Balban himself invaded Bengal in 1281. His son, Nasiruddin Bughra Khan, assisted him in this mission. There were about three hundred thousand soldiers in Balban's army. This massive army was accompanied with a huge navy. Tughan fled to Jajnagar by river. Balban split his army into smaller groups. One such small group led by Malik Sher Andaz attacked Tughan's army and Tughan was defeated and killed in the battle. After Tughan's death, Balban put his son in charge of Bengal. Thus the separatist Mameluk ruling of Bengal ended in 1281.

The Jaruga is one of the oldest power-generating facilities in the world. Its present location dates back to 1903, when it was moved from the nearby original Jaruga power station built in 1895. History Jaruga 2 power plant in center of Krka National Park. The oldest Jaruga power plant was the first alternating current (AC) power system in Croatia. It was designed to power the street lights in Šibenik, making it the first city in the world with street lights powered by a polyphase system of alternating current (AC). In 1893, the mayor of Šibenik Ante Šupuk and one Vjekoslav Meichsner started a business and obtained a license to use the waters of river Krka, and in 1894 they obtained permission to set up electrical power lines on municipal property in order to start lighting the streets with electric power. The construction of Jaruga started in 1894 and lasted for 16 months. The two generators (42 Hz, 550 kW each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the Hungarian company Ganz. The transmission line from the power plant to the city of Šibenik was long on wooden towers, and the municipal distribution grid 3000V/110 V included six transformer stations. The original Jaruga system supplied 340 street lights and some electrified houses in Šibenik. Croatian Post printed a stamp commemorating this power plant in 1995. The Croatian national electricity company HEP lists the same event and date as its origin and marks the date. Three years after the first Jaruga was built, the construction of the second Jaruga hydro power plant began, the current location. It was completed in 1903 when its capacity was 6 MW. Since its construction, the current Jaruga has been refurbished in 1916, 1937, 1970, 1995 and 2008, but the basic concept of the plant had been maintained. In 1936 a second generator was installed that increased the capacity to 5,6 MW. Catchment and capacity Old turbine from Jaruga power plant. The Krka River rises under the travertine barrier of the Topolje waterfall near the town of Knin. Total length of the Krka River, from its spring to its end in the Adriatic sea near Skradin is 56 km. Total Krka catchment area is 2427 km2, of which 142 km2 is included in the Krka National park. Along its course, the Krka receives a number of important tributaries. Some major among them are Krčić, Kosovčica, Orašnica, Butišnica, Miljacka, Čikola, Goduča and Rivina Jaruga. The Jaruga power plant is the last one of five hydro power plants in the Krka catchment, from its spring to the sea. It uses the gross head of about 26 m, which is a portion of the naturally concentrated head of about 45 m at the Skradinski buk waterfall. Visovačko jezero (lake) is upstream the waterfall and the Krka and Prokljansko jezero (lake), affected by the sea backwaters, downstream. This is a typical run-off- the-river plant of diversion type, with no possibility of water regulation. Total installed capacity is 5.4 MW and average annual output 35 GWh. It is a minor power plant concerning both capacity and annual output. Also the most important use is to power or give energy to the park. The Krka River catchment hydroelectric power plants Entrance of water to Jaruga power plant comes from Skradinski buk. *Golubić Hydroelectric Power Plant *Small Krčić Hydroelectric Power Plant *Miljacka Hydroelectric Power Plant *Roški Slap Hydroelectric Power Plant *Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant See also *Krka *Krka National Park *Hrvatska elektroprivreda References External links  * http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/conferences/che2007/prog_comm.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20110719133609/http://www.croatia.ch/zanimljivosti/070812.php Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Croatia Category:Buildings and structures in Šibenik-Knin County Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1895 ","title":"Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant"},{"id":"21747538","text":"Remasellus parvus, the swimming Florida cave isopod, is an isopod endemic to \\"4 caves in the Ochlockonee and Aucilla-Suwanee drainages of Florida\\", United States.

It is dedicated to his cousin Alexander Siloti, and it was intended to be part of a larger work because it is headed \\"Third movement\\". The model for the work is the Scherzo from Felix Mendelssohn's incidental music for Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Rachmaninoff had earlier transcribed Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony for two pianos, and the Scherzo also has echoes of that work. The piece is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (B♭), 2 bassoons, horn (F), trumpet (B♭), 2 timpani, violins I, violins II, violas, cellos and double basses. The first performance of both the Scherzo and another early work, Prince Rostislav, took place in Moscow on 2 November 1945, conducted by Nikolai Anosoff. The Scherzo was published in 1947.

The New York Mets drafted Burnett in the eighth round of the 1995 MLB draft, out of Central Arkansas Christian School in North Little Rock, Arkansas, where he helped lead the team to back-to-back state championships. The Mets traded him to the Marlins, and Burnett made his MLB debut in . He signed with the Blue Jays as a free agent, before the season, and with the Yankees before the season. The Yankees traded Burnett to the Pirates before the season. After two years in Pittsburgh, he signed with the Phillies, where he played one season, before rejoining the Pirates for his final season. Burnett recorded a no-hitter in a complete game shutout in , despite walking 9 batters. He led the National League (NL) in shutouts in , and the American League (AL) in strikeouts in . Burnett was a member of the 2009 World Series champion Yankees. He was selected for the NL roster for the 2015 MLB All-Star Game.

On May 12, 2001, Burnett pitched a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres in a 3–0 victory, striking out seven and walking nine. His game-worn cap and a baseball from the game are on display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. On September 7, 2001, Burnett threw a warm-up pitch that accidentally struck the window of a moving pick-up truck. In 2002, he held an ERA of 3.30 and finished with a 12–9 record and 203 strikeouts, career bests that he did not top until 2008. He threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters in 2002, averaging . In 2003, Burnett was limited to four starts before missing the rest of the season due to Tommy John surgery. He spent the postseason on the injured reserve list until the Marlins won the 2003 World Series against the Yankees. He returned in June 2004 and made 19 starts for the Marlins, going 7–6 with an ERA of 3.68. Even during 2004, his first season back from having the surgery, he was able to throw . He was shut down for most of September 2004 due to a less serious elbow injury. The 2005 season was Burnett's last with the Marlins before he became eligible for free agency. As former teammate Carl Pavano had done in the 2004 off-season, he wanted to test the market rather than take whatever new contract the Marlins gave him. Since he was likely to price himself out of the Marlins' budget, he was sought after by several other teams before the July 31 trade deadline, but he ended up not being traded. Burnett seemed to be pitching his best games of the season right around the trade deadline. After he took the loss in the Marlins' first game after the All-Star break, dropping his record to 5–6, he strung together seven consecutive wins. The last of those wins was on August 19, when he pitched eight shutout innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He then lost six consecutive decisions, including four losses in five starts (with an ERA in that span of 5.93) during the Marlins' failed wild-card chase in September, to close out the season with a 12–12 record despite a 3.44 ERA. On September 27, 2005, Burnett was asked by the Marlins to leave the team. The request came a day after he made comments criticizing the organization: \\"We played scared. We managed scared. We coached scared\\", he told reporters following the Marlins' 5–3 loss at Turner Field. \\"I'm sick of it, man. It's depressing around here. A 3–0 ballgame, I give up one run and leave guys on base, it's like they expect us to mess up. And when we do, they chew us out. There is no positive, nothing around here for anybody.\\" Marlins manager Jack McKeon called Burnett into his office and broke the news. Burnett shook his hand, gathered up his belongings, and left. Burnett has since apologized, saying: Because of his dismissal from the team, Burnett finished the season one inning short of receiving a $50,000 bonus for pitching 210 innings during the season; in addition, he was only two strikeouts shy of having his second 200-strikeout season of his career. After Burnett's contract with the Marlins expired, general manager Larry Beinfest did not attempt to re-sign him, which was unlikely to happen anyway, given Florida's financial constraints and the market for Burnett. He threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters in 2005, averaging . Burnett had criticized McKeon for not allowing the team's less experienced players to have much playing time. Although probably not because of Burnett's comments, McKeon decided to let rookie Josh Johnson, a September call up from the Class AA Carolina Mudcats, make the first major league start of his career on September 30, 2005. Previously, Burnett was scheduled to make his last start of the year at that game. Burnett declared free agency on October 27, the first day after the end of the 2005 World Series. Blue Jays in 2008. Toronto Blue Jays On the morning of December 6, 2005, at the Baseball Winter Meetings being held in Dallas, Texas, the Toronto Blue Jays signed Burnett to a five- year, $55 million deal.https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2249623 The Blue Jays took a chance by signing Burnett due to his being prone to injuries, and the 2006 season began with him going on the disabled list when a piece of scar tissue—remnants of his Tommy John surgery—broke off in his pitching arm. However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like Matt Morris and Paul Byrd had less impressive career stats, even though they had fewer health risks. Burnett was activated on April 15, 2006, and made a start against the Chicago White Sox, giving up four runs in six innings of work. In his next start, against the Boston Red Sox, Burnett was removed from the game after only four innings due to soreness in his right arm. He would end up on the disabled list again, this time for over two months. Burnett finished the 2006 year on a strong note however, finishing the season with a 10–8 record and a 3.98 ERA. After opening the 2007 season with a very poor outing against the Detroit Tigers, lasting only 2.0 innings and allowing five hits and six runs (27.00 ERA), Burnett settled down in his next four starts, finishing April 2–1, with an ERA of 4.18. The Blue Jays experienced a number of injuries early, including losing All-Star closer B. J. Ryan for the season due to an elbow injury, and Opening Day starter Roy Halladay to an appendectomy for four weeks. Burnett was the only pitcher to make all his starts through the first two months of the season. In that period, Burnett posted a 3.98 ERA, throwing 71.0 innings. Burnett missed 48 games during two stints on the disabled list, finishing the 2007 season 10–8 with an ERA of 3.75. The 2008 season started off with frustration for Burnett due to a right index finger injury he suffered during the offseason, the nail of the index finger partially torn after it was caught in a closing car door. Against Chicago White Sox pitcher Javier Vázquez in early September at U.S. Cellular Field, Burnett took a no-hitter into the sixth inning before giving up a hard hit that bounced off Scott Rolen's glove, but got the win. Vazquez himself also pitched well, not giving up a hit until the fourth inning but ultimately took the loss. On September 24, in Burnett's final start of the season (number 34), he pitched against the Yankees, lasting eight innings, giving up two runs (one earned), seven hits and striking out 11, to finish off the season with an AL-leading 231 strikeouts. When he was relieved in the beginning of the ninth inning, he received a very long and memorable standing ovation and came out for a curtain call after being congratulated by the players. Despite his outing, he was awarded a no-decision, and the Jays lost 6–2 in extra innings. Burnett finished the 2008 season with an 18–10 record and established career highs in almost every single pitching category. He set a career high with 18 wins, appeared in 35 games while starting 34 games, pitched 221 innings, and led the American league with 231 strikeouts. His 34 starts also led the AL, and he threw curveballs a higher percentage of the time than any other AL starter; 29.2%. His five-year contract with the Blue Jays allowed him to opt out at the end of the 2008 season, and he chose to do so, becoming a free agent. Yankees in 2009. New York Yankees AJ Burnett (center) leaves the bullpen, flanked by pitching coach Dave Eiland and catcher Francisco Cervelli On December 18, 2008, Burnett signed a five-year $82.5 million contract with the New York Yankees. On June 20, 2009, in the third inning of a game against the Florida Marlins, he pitched an immaculate inning, striking out all three batters on three pitches each. He became the 39th person to achieve this feat. On October 9, 2009, Burnett made his postseason debut in a win against the Minnesota Twins in Game 2 of the American League Divisional Series, in which he earned a no-decision. On October 17, he pitched a no-decision in Game 2 of an American League Championship Series win against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Burnett made his first career World Series start in Game 2 against the Philadelphia Phillies on October 29, and earned his first career post season win by pitching seven innings, recording nine strike-outs and allowing only one run. However, in Game 5, he set a record when he hit Shane Victorino in the first inning, his fifth hit batter of the 2009 postseason. The Yankees would go on to win their 27th franchise championship by beating the Phillies in 6 games, giving Burnett his second career championship ring. Burnett started off the 2010 season with a 6–2 record through the end of May. However, during the time Yankees pitching coach Dave Eiland took a leave of absence for a few weeks, Burnett's numbers plummeted in June where he went winless. Burnett broke his winless streak upon Eiland's return, but lost again to the Tampa Bay Rays in his first start since the end of the All-Star break, a game where he injured his hand after punching a door out of frustration. He finished the season with a 10–15 record, an ERA of 5.26, and a WHIP of 1.51, all career worsts. Burnett struck out four batters in one inning, becoming the first Yankee to accomplish this rare feat. This occurred in the 6th inning of a game against the Colorado Rockies on June 24, 2011. In the 2011 American League Division Series against Detroit, the Yankees, facing elimination, turned to Burnett to pitch Game 4 at Comerica Park. Burnett threw innings, giving up just one run despite four walks, and the Yankees won 10–1, shifting the series back to Yankee Stadium for a decisive Game 5. The Yankees ended up falling to the Tigers, 3–2, in that contest.A. J. Burnett pitches New York to Game 4 victory in Detroit The Washington Post Burnett's 2011 season was not much better than his 2010 campaign, as he finished with a record of 11–11, a 5.15 ERA, and a WHIP of 1.44.

Less frequently, he also threw a changeup to left-handed hitters at 87–89 mph. The curve is especially good for swinging strikes with its 44% whiff rate for Burnett's career.

The Geer tube used a pattern of small phosphor- covered three-sided pyramids on the inside of the CRT faceplate to mix separate red, green and blue signals from three electron guns. The Geer tube had a number of disadvantages, and was never used commercially due to the much better images generated by RCA's shadow mask system. Nevertheless, Geer's patent was awarded first, and RCA purchased an option on it in case their own developments didn't pan out. HistoryColor television= Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \\"gel\\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Each frame encoded one color of the picture, and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used.Ed Reitan, \\"CBS Field Sequential Color System\\" , 24 August 1997 RCA worked along different lines entirely, using a luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the \\"luminance\\". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on black and white televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal - on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original RGB for display. Although RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the luminance concept, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era.Ed Reitan, \\"RCA Dot Sequential Color System\\" , 28 August 1997 =Geer's solution= Charles Willard Geer, then an assistant professor at the University of Southern California, was lecturing on the mechanical methods of producing color television that were being experimented with in the 1940s, and decided that an electronically scanned system would be superior, if someone would only invent one. Mentioning it later to his wife, she replied \\"You'd better get busy and invent it yourself\\".Teacher's Geer solved the display problem with the novel application of optics. Instead of trying to focus the electron beams onto tiny spots, he instead focused them onto larger areas and used simple optics to re-combine each individual primary color at any given place on the screen into a single pixel. The tube was arranged with three separate electron guns, one each for red, green and blue (RGB), arranged around the outside of the picture area. This made a Geer tube quite large; the \\"necks\\" of the tubes normally lie behind the display area and give the TV its depth, whereas in the Geer tube the necks projected around the outside of the display area, making it much larger.Color Television Device The rear face of the screen was covered with a series of tiny triangular pyramids imprinted on an aluminum sheet, coated on the inside of each face with colored phosphor. Properly aligned, a given electron beam could only reach one face of the pyramids, striking it and traveling through the thin metal into the thicker phosphor layer inside. When all three guns hit their respective faces, the colored light was created in the interior of the pyramid where it mixed, producing a proper color display on the open base, which faced the user. One enormous advantage of the Geer system is that it could be used with any of the proposed color television broadcasting systems. CBS was promoting a \\"field sequential\\" system at 144 frames per second that they intended to display with a mechanical color filter wheel. This same signal could be displayed on a Geer tube by sending each successive frame to a different gun, in turn. RCA's \\"dot sequential\\" system could also be shown by de-multiplexing the signals and sending all three color signals to each of the appropriate guns at the same time. B&W; signals could be displayed by sending the same signal, muted by 1/3, also to all three guns at the same time. Getting the electron beam to hit the correct pyramid, and not surrounding ones, was a major problem for the design. The beam from an electron gun is normally circular, so when it was aimed at a triangular target, some part of the beam normally went past the target pyramid and hit others on the screen. This results in overscan, causing the image to be blurry and washed out. The problem was particularly difficult to solve because the angle between the beam and faces changed as the beams scanned the tube - pyramids near the gun would be hit at close to a right angle, but ones at the opposite side of the tube were at an acute angle.Television Color Screen Considering that each gun was offset from the CRT's main axis, it was necessary to make major geometrical corrections to the raster geometry during the scan. =Competing systems= Geer filed for a patent on his design on 11 July 1944. Technicolor purchased the patent rights and started development of prototype units in concert with the Stanford Research Institute, spending a reported $500,000 in 1950 (approx. equivalent, $4 million, in 2005) on development.\\"The Patent, Trade-mark, and Copyright Journal of Research and Education\\", George Washington University, spring 1960 The system was widely reported on at the time, including mentions in Time Magazine, Popular Science,\\"Tube Shows TV in Color\\", Popular Science, March 1949, pg. 118 Popular Mechanics,\\"Rainbow on the TV Screen\\", Popular Mechanics, January 1950, pp. 97–103 Radio Electronics,Fred Shunaman, \\"Color Television Systems\\", Radio-electronics, Volume 22, 1950, pg. 20 and others. Many other companies were also working on color television systems, most notably RCA. They had filed a patent on their shadow mask system only a few weeks after Geer. When Geer, and Technicolor, informed RCA of their patent, RCA took out licenses and adding further funding to the project as a \\"second iron in the fire\\" in case none of their in-house developments worked out. In head-to-head testing against other color television systems for the NTSC color standardization efforts that started in November 1949, Geer's tube did not fare particularly well. Overscan bled the colors into neighboring pixels and led to soft colors and poor color registration and contrast. This problem was by no means limited to the Geer tube; several different technologies were demonstrated at the show, and only the CBS mechanical system proved able to produce a picture that satisfied the judges. In 1950, the CBS system was adopted as the NTSC standard. Geer continued to work on the overscan problems throughout the late 1940s and into the 1950s, filing additional patents on various corrections to improve the system. Other vendors were making similar strides with their own technologies, and in 1953 the NTSC reconvened a panel to consider the color issue. This time RCA's shadow mask system quickly demonstrated itself as superior to all the other systems, including Geer's. The shadow mask remained the primary method of building color televisions, with Sony Trinitron a distant second, until the early 2000s when LCD technology replaced CRTs. At the same time, RCA's version of color encoding into a signal that was compatible with existing B&W; sets was also adopted, with modifications, and remained the primary U.S. television standard until 2009, when analog television was shut down. =After NTSC= Geer continued to work on his basic concept for some time, as well as other television related concepts. In 1955 he filed a patent on a flat TV tube that used a gun arranged to lie beside the image area that fired upward towards the top. The beam was deflected through 90 degrees by a series of charged wires so the beam was now traveling horizontally across the back of the picture area. A second grid, located beside the first, then bent the beams through a small angle so they hit the back of the screen.Television Picture It does not appear that this device was ever constructed, and the arrangement of aiming elements suggests focusing the image would be a serious problem. Two other inventors had been working on this problem was well, Dennis Gabor in England (better known for the development of holograms) and William Aiken in the US. Both of their patents were filed before Geer's, and the Aiken tube was successfully built in small numbers. More recently, similar concepts were used, combined with computer controlled convergence systems, to produce \\"flatter\\" systems, typically for computer monitor use. Sony sold small-screen monochrome TVs using basically-similar nearly-flat CRTs; they were used for outside-broadcast monitors, as well. However these were quickly displaced by LCD-based systems. In 1960 he filed for a patent on a three-dimensional television system that used two color tubes and a 2-dimensional version of his pyramids. The vertical channels reflected the light in two directions, providing different images for each eye.Three-Dimensional =Patents= * U.S. Patent 2,480,848, \\"Color Television Device\\", Charles Willard Geer/Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation, filed 11 July 1944, issued 6 September 1949 * U.S. Patent 2,622,220, \\"Television Color Screen\\", Charles Willard Geer/Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation, filed 22 March 1949, issued 16 December 1952 * U.S. Patent 2,850,669, \\"Television Picture Tube or the Like\\", Charles Willard Geer, filed 26 April 1955, issued 2 September 1958 * U.S. Patent 3,184,630, \\"Three- Dimensional Display Apparatus\\", Charles Willard Geer, filed 12 July 1960, issued 18 May 1960 See also * Chromatron, another early color television CRT that is no longer used * Beam-index tube * Shadow mask * Aperture grille ReferencesCitationsBibliography= * Edward W.

He is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Early life Carey was born in Mount Pleasant, Michigan on March 15, 1928. His parents were Joseph P. Carey, a geography professor at Central Michigan University, and Ida B. Carey. He graduated from Mount Pleasant High School in 1946, attended Central Michigan from 1946 to 1948 and then Michigan State University from 1948 to 1950, graduating with a B.A. in Speech, Radio and Dramatics. His broadcast career was interrupted in 1950 with the outbreak of the Korean War. Carey was drafted in October 1950 and served in the Fourth Infantry Division, the first NATO division. He was a squad leader staff sergeant in a weapons platoon. Broadcasting career Tiger Stadium, 1991 Carey was on the original announcing staff of WCEN in Mt. Pleasant when it went on the air on August 8, 1949. Later that year, he was part of the first broadcast ever made of a Central Michigan University football game. After completing his education and Army stint, he resumed his announcing and sportscasting duties at WCEN in October 1952. In April 1953, Carey moved to WKNX in Saginaw, Michigan to become the afternoon disc-jockey. He also worked on WKNX-TV and did the first on-camera commercial for that station. During his stay at WKNX, Carey was program director of radio for two years. In June 1956, Carey joined the announcing staff at WJR in Detroit, Michigan and worked there until his retirement in January 1992. He was a staff announcer from 1956 to 1965, and became Assistant Sports Director in 1958. During his tenure, he did pre- and post-game shows for Detroit Lions radio broadcasts; served as a play-by-play announcer for Detroit Pistons basketball for six seasons (1969-70 through 1972-73, 1975–76, and 1981–82); and originated and hosted a Michigan High School football and basketball scoreboard program. He was a member of the Associated Press All-State and ratings panel for 20 years. WJR was the flagship station for the Detroit Tigers Radio Network, and Carey produced the broadcasts for the network from 1964 to 1971. When Ray Lane moved to television broadcasting, Carey joined Ernie Harwell as a play-by-play announcer for the 1973 season, a position he would maintain for 19 seasons. Except for the last three seasons, he handled engineering duties for the broadcasts as well. In December 1990, Harwell held a press conference to announce that WJR and the Tigers had forced him out of his position, and that the 1991 season would be his last. At the same press conference, Carey announced - in an unrelated decision made several months earlier - that he would retire at the end of the season. His last Tigers broadcast was on the final day of the 1991 season, the final baseball game at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore. In 2012, Carey was named the third recipient of the Detroit Sports Broadcaster's Association (DSBA)'s Harwell Lifetime Contribution Award, after Harwell (the Hall of Fame announcer who came to the team in 1960 and announced Tigers' games for 42 seasons) and John Fountain. The award honors an individual from the broadcast industry who has contributed outstanding time and effort to the betterment of sports broadcasting through a lifetime body of work. Death  Carey died on April 12, 2016 in Rochester, Michigan from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), at the age of 88.

It takes the name from Fort McMurray and was first described from outcrops along the banks of the Athabasca River north of Fort McMurray by F.H. McLearn in 1917.McLearn, F.H., 1917. Athabasca River section, Alberta. Geological Survey of Canada Summary Report 1916, p. 145-151. It is a well-studied example of fluvial to estuarine sedimentation, and it is economically important because it hosts most of the vast bitumen resources of the Athabasca Oil Sands region. Lithology The McMurray Formation consists of fine- to coarse-grained quartzitic sand and sandstone, interbedded with lesser amounts of silt, mud, clay and, less commonly, thin coal beds. The sands are very loose and friable, unless they are partially or fully cemented with bitumen or, less commonly, with calcite, iron oxides, or quartz.Glass, D.J., editor, 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, Alberta, 1423 p. on CD-ROM, . Stratigraphy Three members have been defined within the McMurray Formation. They can be differentiated in outcrops and, to a lesser degree, in the subsurface: *Lower Member: typically coarse-grained to conglomeratic sand, with minor beds of silt and mud; present only in depressions in the underlying Devonian formations; typically saturated with water, or poorly saturated with bitumen. *Middle Member: typically massive, well sorted, fine-grained sand at the base, with inclined beds of thick, rippled sand and thin shaley silt partings in the upper portion; usually well-saturated with bitumen. *Upper Member: typically horizontal beds of argillaceous, very fine-grained sand; usually saturated with bitumen. =Distribution= Outcrop of the McMurray Formation (black and dark grey) and underlying Waterways Formation (tan) on the Steepbank River. A boulder of McMurray Formation oil sand near the Athabasca River north of Fort McMurray. The McMurray Formation outcrops along the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers and their tributaries near Fort McMurray in the Athabasca Oil Sands of northeastern Alberta, where it averages about thick. It thins eastward into Saskatchewan where, in most areas, it is devoid of bitumen. It has been removed by erosion north of the Athabasca Oil Sands area. =Relationship to other units= The McMurray Formation is conformably overlain by the Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation. It is underlain by Devonian formations that were tilted and eroded prior to the deposition of the McMurray, resulting in a shallow angular unconformity between the McMurray and the underlying units. The McMurray therefore rests on different Devonian units in different parts of the basin. These range from the Elk Point Group in the east near the Saskatchewan border, to the Waterways Formation along the Athabasca River, and the Banff, Wabamun, and Winterburn Formations farther west. The McMurray Formation is equivalent to the lower Mannville Group of Alberta, the Dina Formation of eastern Saskatchewan, the Gething Formation of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia, and the Ellerslie Formation and Ostracod Beds of central Alberta. McMurray Formation oil sand as seen in drill cores. Arrow indicates a fragment of fossil wood. Depositional History The McMurray Formation was deposited by an extensive drainage system that flowed northward following a regional north-south depression. The depression was created by the dissolution of thick salt deposits in the Devonian Elk Point Group deep within the subsurface. A rising sea encroached upon the drainage system from the north, and as this marine transgression progressed, depositional environments changed from fluvial at the base (Lower Member), to estuarine (Middle Member), to shore-face at the top (Upper Member), and finally to open marine in the overlying Clearwater Formation. The channel sand deposits host the majority of the bitumen which is contained in the pore spaces between the sand grains. The largest sand channels occur in the Middle Member where, in places, they reach thicknesses of more than . They are flanked by off-channel deposits that consist primarily of mud and silt that accumulated in the floodplain, tidal flat, swamp, and brackish-bay environments that existed contemporaneously with the channels.Flach, P.D. and Mossop, G.D., 1985.

Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, 17: 155-181. Origin of the Hydrocarbons The original petroleum was probably generated from the organic shales of the Exshaw Formation, according to organic biomarker studies and isotopic ratios that act as a fingerprint for specific rock units. It then migrated up dip toward the northeast.Schaefer, B.F. 2005. When do rocks become oil? Science, vol. 308, p. 1267-1268. Radiometric dating by the rhenium-osmium method indicates that it was emplaced in the McMurray and other formations at 112 ± 5.3 Ma (million years ago), not long after the deposition of the McMurray sediments.Selby, D. and Creaser, R.A. 2005. Direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits using rhenium-osmium isotopes. Science, vol. 308, p. 1293-1295. Biodegradation by bacteria then converted the oil to immobile bitumen. This may have contributed to the trapping mechanism for the hydrocarbons, as well as hampering the lithification of the host sediments. Hydrocarbon Production McMurray Formation mined in Syncrude's Mildred Lake mine site Bitumen has been produced from the McMurray Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sands since 1967, at first by open-pit mining, and later from the subsurface as well, using in-situ techniques such as Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD). As of 2010, the output of oil sands production had reached more than ; 53% of this was produced by surface mining and 47% by in- situ methods. The Alberta government estimates that production could reach by 2020 and possibly by 2030. Hydrogeology The Lower Member of the McMurray Formation consists predominantly of poorly consolidated, discontinuous sand bodies. These sands are commonly saturated with water rather than with bitumen, and they lie beneath the bitumen-saturated sands which are aquitards.Barson, D., Bachu, S. and Esslinger, P. 2001. Flow systems in the Mannville Group in the east-central Athabasca area and implications for steam- assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations for in situ bitumen production. Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, vo. 49, no. 3, p. 376-392. They are commonly referred to as the Basal Water Sand (BWS) aquifers.page=4 Where these aquifers are deep-lying, they are recharged with saline water from the underlying Devonian formations, but where they lie at relatively shallow depths, recharge occurs from meteoric (surface) water and they are non-saline. The BWS aquifers are commonly depressurized prior to open-pit mining because high pore water pressures can reduce pit-wall stability, and seepage onto the pit floor can reduce trafficability. They also have a negative impact on SAGD operations if they are in hydraulic communication with a steam chamber, resulting in heat loss. There are also aquifers within the Upper McMurray Member and the overlying Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation. These can also interfere with SAGD operations if cool water from these aquifers invades the steam chambers.

The site was previously branded as Baseball Primer, and was created in 2001 by the founders of Baseball-Reference. Contributors who have gone on to work for Major League Baseball front offices include Voros McCracken, Carlos Gomez, and Tom Tango. Bill James' Baseball Abstract books published in the 1980s are widely considered to be the modern predecessor to websites using sabermetrics such as baseballthinkfactory and baseballprospectus.Michael Lewis, Moneyball p. 235, Norton Press, 2004.  History  The site was founded in 2001 by Jim Furtado and Sean Forman of Baseball-Reference under the name \\"Baseball Primer,\\" with a matching URL of (http://www.baseballprimer.com/). The site's emphasis on sabermetric baseball analysis attracted members of the rec.sport.baseball Usenet groups, and later drew readers of Rob Neyer's ESPN columns. The early site cultivated spirited discussions as a result of the Usenet veterans' familiarity with each other and the fact that registration was not required to post comments. The site also featured a number of original research articles. In 2004, the site was re-branded as \\"Baseball Think Factory\\" and was re-built on a different software platform in order to support the growing user population and accommodate user registration and content management features. BTF mainly hosts baseball discussions. Sports Illustrated magazine listed the site as an \\"essential baseball destination,\\" characterizing it as offering \\"links to significant baseball articles, accompanied by freewheeling, usually informed discussion threads.\\" Michael Lewis also mentioned the site (as baseballprimer) in his book Moneyball.  Site sections  The site features a number of sections with content for different audiences. These include: * Baseball Newsstand – a newsblog where baseball-related articles are linked. Entries usually feature an excerpt of the article along with a discussion thread. * Hall of Merit (abbreviated as the HoM) – a sub-site conceived by Joe Dimino as an alternative to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The purpose of the HoM is \\"to identify the best players in baseball history and thereby identify the omissions and errors that can be found in the other venerable institution.\\" The discussions often appeal to sabermetric criteria, including in-depth understanding of the various historical eras of major league and negro league baseball as well as advanced statistics.HoM members elected thus farHoM Constitution * Transaction Oracle – Szymborski posts analyses of major league transactions (player signings and trades), and articles on his ZiPS forecasting system, which is designed to forecast player statistics based on past performance and similarities to other major league players. * Team Sites – sub-sections of the newsblog that link to articles of interest to specific teams. There currently are four such team blogs: Sox Therapy (Boston Red Sox), Gonfalon Cubs (Chicago Cubs), Count the Rings (New York Yankees), and It's Mets...Just Mets (New York Mets) * Game \\"Chatters\\" – specific threads on regular season and postseason major league baseball games (as well as for special events such as the Olympics or the World Baseball Championship). Site members contribute to the group liveblog during these events. * Dialed In and Primate Studies – sub-sites with original baseball research and more in-depth discussion.  Original research  BTF has featured numerous original research articles, primarily under the aforementioned sub-sites \\"Transaction Oracle,\\" \\"Dialed In,\\" and \\"Primate Studies.\\" Several analysts such as Mitchel Lichtman and Tom Tango regularly posted original research articles and participated on discussion and criticism of the work at BTF before going on to establish their own sites and to publish results in book form. Given that statistics characterizing major league offense (batting) are fairly well established, much of the research posted on BTF spotlight defense (fielding) in the form of statistics more accurate than traditional fielding statistics. Examples include: =Mitchel Litchman's articles on ultimate zone rating= Litchman created fielding metrics that use play-by-play records that record the location of individual batted balls. Litchman combines this play-by-play data with his linear-weights system that assigns run values to the various baseball plays and their context within the game (inning, runners on base, score, etc.) Some of his initial articles on the system were posted on BTF.Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR), Part 1, 2003/03/14Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR), Part 2, 2003/03/21 Lichtman's Ultimate zone ratings (UZR) statistics can now be found on the baseball website Fangraphs. =ZiPS= Szymborski posts updates from his forecasting system known as \\"ZiPS\\" under his sub-site Transaction Oracle.Transaction Oracle ZiPS results are also used in his articles evaluating Major League Baseball transactions. These projections can also be found on Fangraphs, updated for in-season projections. =Chris Dial's Dialed In columns= Dial is a SABR member who contributes articles to BTF, many focusing on statistics measuring defense. Dial has studied STATS, Inc.'s \\"zone rating\\" for years and posts updated statistics based on this data and on Retrosheet data. Some of Dial's more notable articles include: *Dial provides OPD – a statistic estimating a player's overall contribution on offense and defense. Offensive values were generated using Extrapolated Runs and defensive values are represented by Dial's DRS (defensive runs saved), which are based on ZR (zone rating) data.Final 2008 Offense Plus Defense (OPD) Results, 2008/10/20. *A reflection on generating statistics based on retrosheet play- by-play fielding data, the relative impact of including line drive (LD) data.Defensive Analysis – Continuous Improvement, 2007/12/30. *Article on how to create a metric to measure a player's performance on defense, based on zone rating (ZR) data.

He scored the opening goal winning the 1959 FA Cup Final for Nottingham Forest. CareerFulham= Although a winger, he was renowned for his shooting ability. Dwight scored 54 goals in 72 games for Fulham between 1954 and 1958, including a hat-trick against Liverpool in 1956. In 1957, he was in the London XI that beat Lausanne Sport 2–0 in the semi-final second leg of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup at Highbury. =Nottingham Forest= He moved on to Nottingham Forest in the summer of 1958 for a 'substantial' fee, reported as £10,000. In 1958–59, his only full season at Nottingham Forest, Dwight scored 26 goals in 41 League and 9 FA Cup appearances, including two hat-tricks. He opened the scoring after 10 minutes for Forest in the 1959 FA Cup Final against Luton Town. After 33 minutes, with Forest winning 2–0, Dwight was carried off the Wembley pitch after breaking his leg in a tackle with Luton's Brendan McNally. Ten-man Forest held on, winning the match 2–1 to become the only team reduced in numbers by injury to win the trophy. Despite scoring in his comeback game the following March, he was not the player he had been before his injury. He played only twice more for Forest before dropping out of League football. =Later career= He moved back to play in his native Kent with Gravesend and Northfleet. He returned to league football with spells at Coventry City and Millwall. He later managed Tooting and Mitcham, who had been Forest's 3rd round opponents in their winning FA Cup run in 1959, and also managed Dartford. Career outside football Later in life during the 1970s he taught Physical Education at Forest Hill Boys Secondary School. He took up a position of Assistant Racing Manager in the greyhound racing industry at Catford Stadium and later Crayford & Bexleyheath Stadium.

The track was originally planned to be included on the band's 2009 album No Line on the Horizon, but it was cut at the end of the recording sessions as it did not fit the album's theme. The song does appear on the accompanying film Linear. \\"Winter\\" was written for the 2009 war film Brothers at the request of director Jim Sheridan, and it plays over the closing credits. Several different versions of the song have been recorded, including an uptempo rock arrangement on Linear and a slower acoustic version in Brothers. The song was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Writing and recording \\"Winter\\" was written for the 2009 war film Brothers directed by Jim Sheridan. After telling the band about the script for the film, Sheridan asked them if they would write a song for it. Guitarist The Edge began to compose a piece on piano that the band thought would fit the film. As the recording progressed, it became a \\"conventional, straightforward arrangement\\" which The Edge described as \\"too close to the U2 sound and U2 form\\". The track did not begin to come together until U2 viewed a rough cut of the film. The Edge noted \\"it was really at that point that we really got inspired and the song started to come together quite quickly\\". With the help of producer Brian Eno, the band began to work on the song from a different angle, with the result being a more stripped-down version that echoed The Edge's original piano composition. The Edge stated that the piano \\"seemed to be the key to making the song work... when we went back to that instrument, it seemed to lock in and start to make sense\\". The original rock arrangement is the one in Linear, while the acoustic version is what appears in Brothers. In addition, an electronic version has also been developed. Lead singer Bono wrote the lyrics in one night and they were revised just once after that. Tobey Maguire's character Captain Sam Cahill was the inspiration for the lyric, with the band noting that the focus on \\"intense hidden emotion\\" and the secrets he held inside \\"was a jumping off point, thematically.\\" Bono noted that Sheridan wanted a \\"complex song for a complex character\\" and so the band wrote two songs: \\"Winter\\" and \\"White as Snow\\". While \\"White as Snow\\" focuses more on the relationship between the Cahill brothers, \\"Winter\\" is a \\"more universal song about the experience of the armed forces in Afghanistan.\\" U2 wanted to include \\"Winter\\" on the album No Line on the Horizon, as well as on Brothers, but this ultimately did not happen; The Edge noted that \\"though it's a beautiful tune, it doesn't quite fit on our record thematically\\". The song was cut in the final days of recording. Brothers was planned to be released before No Line on the Horizon, but the timing made it difficult to complete the song in time, and the band offered Sheridan the use of \\"White as Snow\\" instead. The eventual delay in the release of Brothers gave the band enough time to complete \\"Winter\\" and it was used in the film's closing credits. The band later noted that it was a better selection for the film than \\"White as Snow\\". Composition Q described the rockier Linear version as being \\"surrounded by a deceptively simple rhythm track and an evocative string arrangement courtesy of Eno.\\" Appearances in other media \\"Winter\\" appears as the third track in the Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. During the sequence, the cop, played by Saïd Taghmaoui, leaves Paris and begins his journey across the French and Spanish countryside. It ends with him pulling off the road for a rest where the next track, \\"White as Snow\\", begins. Reception For its role in Brothers, \\"Winter\\" was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 2010 ceremony. In a preview of No Line on the Horizon, Q called the Linear version one of the \\"instantly striking tracks\\" while describing Bono's \\"lyric about a soldier in an unspecified war zone\\" as \\"fine\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Brian Hiatt called it a \\"lovely discarded ballad\\". The Los Angeles Times had a negative impression of the Brothers version, labelling it \\"a snails-paced somber number with some oh-so-serious, look-at-me flashes of rhythm\\" while noting that it \\"could have used some of the gospel atmospheres of the act's 2009 effort No Line on the Horizon.\\" ReferencesExternal links *U2.com Category:U2 songs Category:2009 songs Category:Songs written by Bono Category:Songs written by the Edge Category:Songs written by Adam Clayton Category:Songs written by Larry Mullen Jr. Category:Song recordings produced by Brian Eno Category:Song recordings produced by Daniel Lanois Category:Songs written for films ","title":"Winter (U2 song)"},{"id":"21747865","text":"right The Nihon Ukulele Association () is a Japanese association for ukulele players.

Background Jacob was a Reuters journalist in England and America and a war correspondent during World War II. He wrote several novels and recounted his experiences during the war and in Moscow afterwards. He explains the work by stating that having written about Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, Margot Asquith, Stanley Baldwin, Winston Churchill, Henry Wallace, Wavell, Montgomery, Petain and all the rest, he has \\"had his fill\\" of them. He says that the people that interest him are the unknown characters he encountered while roving about. These characters form the basis of the eclectic collection of short stories. Stories * Hamilton Despard - touching on Jacob's own his interest in books as a child, the narrator meets Despard an enthusiastic Proustian. Despard's homosexual relationship with another young man apparently ends in tragedy, although the narrator is disinclined to believe his story. Following Despard's own death, the narrator discovers the truth * Mickey Finn - reflecting Jacob's wartime experiences in Iran, the narrator picks up a Finnish cabaret dancer in Teheran. She repeatedly lets him down at rendezvous and the narrator angered and intrigued tries to understand her, but has to leave Teheran with a weight of unanswered questions. * A Dream of Gerontius - Henry Gerontius is a successful novelist whose dream is described. Set at the end of the war it posits a Russian occupation of Britain. Gerontius is sought at his club by a Russian officer. He fears arrest, but it turns out he is required as a cultural guide and is taken to help assess the suitability of the Royal Lodge at Windsor as the official residence of the governing Marshal. During the journey the Russian misinterprets English literature and identifies potential members of a British government in an occupied country. However having reached the lodge, the officer concludes that the plebeian taste at the Lodge and the view of the chimneys at Slough render it unsuitable for the Marshal and Gerontius is devastated on recognising the reality of occupation. * Kultur Kampf - reflecting Jacob's stay in Moscow during the war, this provides the background to Gerontius's dream when the literary Gerontius comes face to face with a Russian general at the end of a heavy evening's drinking at the war correspondent's flat in Moscow. In leading up to this the correspondent has subverted the literary pretensions of Gerontius' wife by upstaging her with a fictitious Shukry Fukhry Bey and horrified the pompous Gerontius by encouraging his vulgar assistant Scutt. * Comrade Stalin's Cap - Stalin dines with Churchill at the British Embassy and mistakes the press correspondent for a footman, handing him his coat and cap. The correspondent has an affectionate Russian girlfriend Nadya who though poor is too proud to take any presents. However, when he tells her he had Stalin's cap in his hand she is furious that he did not have the imagination to take out the Red Star as a present for her and the relationship ends. Years later he meets another correspondent who knew the girl later but who like others could make no progress with her because she was besotted by the memory of the man who gave her Stalin's star. * Captain 'Smack On' - Drawing on Jacob's coverage of the North Africa campaign, he introduces Captain Norbury, a former door-to-door salesman, and now a member of the Information Department and the \\"prize specimen\\" in the mass of non- combatant forces in Cairo well behind the lines in North Africa. Norbory (nicknamed Smack'on' from his favourite expression) is deputed to accompany the war correspondent in the desert and they come under fire when their vehicle, parked conspicuously on the skyline is silhouetted at dawn, Smack'On and his corporal go on reconnaissance and the attacking guns redeploy. Years later, after examining Hitler's bunker, the war correspondent meets Smack'On in a bar in Berlin sporting a distinctive medal and finds himself invited to dinner at the latter's very luxurious residence. The corporal, also decorated, explains that Smack'On's write up of their exploit in the desert had led to the medal award. However three years later Smack'On is court martialed for black market activities * A Spent Muse - The author's genial Uncle Eustace, living comfortably in the English countryside off his property, leads a self- contained bachelor life presenting himself a man of no account and having nothing to offer. However a conversation hints that he was a man of feeling and sense. The following day Jacob discovers a hidden set of novels written by his uncle, well reviewed at the time, but now unknown, and understands the torment his uncle suffered in turning off and repressing his literary ambitions. * Madou - Jacob provides a review of French culture before and after the war. In Paris in the 1930s the narrator had a highly vivacious French girl-friend who was the daughter of a bourgeois couple with a small vineyard in the Dordogne and was betrothed to a poor weak nobleman. He found her lifestyle and Latin temperament thrilling but overwhelming and saw himself as her inferior. After the war, the narrator seeks Madou out when attending a peace conference in Paris and finds her unmarried after a long affair with an aide of de Gaulle. Taken back to Dordogne he revels in the nostalgic French atmosphere but senses that his war adventures and the belief that he is a secret agent has made him attractive to her. However, when he does join the in British Secret Service, he can explain that marrying a foreign national would be impossible and she eventually marries the nobleman. * A Woman of S.W.3 - describes a classy young woman who is left wealthy as a result of two marriages and has a string of relationships. The narrator knew her as a school friend of his sister but now finds her in a bar in Sloane Square on a mysterious assignment. It turns out that she is having an affair with a West Indian bus driver. Her initial enthusiasm for the relationship in defiance of convention of the times turns to disappointment when he becomes just like any other man.

Esztergom, ca. 969 - d. Kraków?, ca. 988)Judith of HUNGARY in: Rootsweb.com [retrieved 23 October 2014]. was a Hungarian princess and member of the House of Arpad. She was briefly married to the Piast duke of Poland, Bolesław the Brave. According to some sources,Oswald Balzer: Genealogia Piastów, Kraków 1895, pp. 39-41S. A. Sroka, Historia Węgier do 1526 roku w zarysie, pp. 19. she was the eldest child of Géza of Hungary by his first wife Sarolt, a daughter of Gyula of Transylvania. However, modern historians have now discarded her parentage, and state that she was an unknown Hungarian princess.Kazimierz Jasiński: Rodowód pierwszych Piastów, Warsaw 1993 Though opinions vary about the identity of Bolesław I's second wife, there are a number of researchers who still support the hypothesis of her being the daughter of Géza.  Life  At the end of 985, Judith became in the second wife of Bolesław, heir of the Polish throne, after he repudiated his first wife Hunilda, daughter of Rikdag, Margrave of Meissen. The union (probably instigated by Duke Boleslav II of Bohemia, maternal uncle of the Polish prince) produced a son, Bezprym. Perhaps because of the deterioration in political relations between Poland and Hungary, around 987 Judith was repudiated and sent away. She probably remained in Poland and died shortly after her divorce; she never became Duchess of Poland because her father-in-law was still alive at the time of her dismissal. Bolesław soon re- married, this time with Emnilda, a Slavic princess, who bore him five children, including the future Mieszko II Lambert. Despite Bezprym being the first-born son, he was deprived of the throne of Poland by his father, who largely favored the children born from his union with Emnilda. Around 1003 Bolesław I sent Bezprym to Italy, where he became a monk in one of Saint Romuald's hermitages. In 1031, in alliance with Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor and the Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise, he finally gained the throne to his half-brother Mieszko II. His reign didn't last long and was murdered one year later. Judith was survived by her father, and when he died in 997, one of his distant cousins Koppány, declared his claim to the leadership of the Magyars against Judith's brother, Vajk. Koppány wanted to marry Judith's stepmother, referring to the Hungarian tradition. Koppány, nevertheless, was defeated, and shortly afterwards Vajk was crowned as the first King of Hungary as Stephen I.

Martin is the founding member of several production teams and recording groups. He has written and produced for a number of artists, and has his own publishing label called Monastery Music Group. Producing and writing Earlier in his career Martin's talents caught the attention of record producer Mykaell Riley. Martin worked as a programmer and researcher for Riley while studying a degree in commercial music, at the University of Westminster. During this time he worked with such as Mark Morrison, Peter Andre, Maria Rowe, MN8 and China Black. It was around this period that he produced demos for Livingston Brown, Gary Benson, Glen Goldsmith and Dionne Bernard (Infinity) – who was signed to RCA Records. Groups and production teams His work led him to collaborate in a number of groups and production teams. His first was a gospel act called 5 in 1, which was formed with his long term friend Muyiwa and produced in partnership with Qura Rankin. In 2002, was the formation of Klinik Music Production. Martin along with Kenny Yeomans and Patrick Jacobs collaborated to bring a number of nu soul artists to the forefront of the music industry in Europe. This resulted in Klinik Music Production winning an EMMA Award for producing Tasha's World self entitled debut album. In the same year, Martin teamed up for a second time with Muyiwa to form the gospel act Riversongz. He co-wrote and produced three albums over a period of six years including Restoration, Declaring His Power and Declaring His Love. It was with Declaring His Love in 2008 that Riversongz achieved a number one slot in HMV's album chart, becoming the fastest selling gospel album to be sold by this music store. To date the albums Declaring His Power and Declaring His Love have sold in excess of 80,000 combined units. He formed the production teams Ashanti Boyz, Afroganic and Monk & Prof in 2007, with Kwame aka \\"Tha Prof\\".

Hair rollers in Tanzania A hair roller or hair curler is a small tube that is rolled into a person's hair in order to curl it, or to straighten curly hair, making a new hairstyle. The diameter of a roller varies from approximately to . The hair is heated, and the rollers strain and break the hydrogen bonds of each hair's cortex, which causes the hair to curl. The hydrogen bonds reform after the hair is moistened. A hot roller or hot curler is designed to be heated in an electric chamber before one rolls it into the hair. Alternatively, a hair dryer heats the hair after the rolls are in place. Hair spray can temporarily fix curled hair in place. In 1930, Solomon Harper created the first electrically-heated hair rollers, then creating a better design in 1953. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protesters symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can\\". These included hair rollers, which were among items the protesters called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. Velcro hair roller A Velcro hair roller is made of a strip of hook and loop fasteners that is wrapped around cylinders. They are available in different sizes and can be used on dry or wet hair. The rollers are self-holding because they do not need pins or clips to be held in place and do not need heat to be applied to create the curls. Typically kept in the hair for about fifteen minutes. To clean Velcro hair rollers hair should be removed from them and then soaked in shampoo and water mixture followed by a vinegar solution to remove any excess oil or dirt.

Biography  Mew has had a prolific career at the Abbey Road Studios, home base of groups like The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and recording engineers such as Alan Parsons. He was involved on the historic Syd Barrett solo recordings, and remastered his compilation albums. He started his career at Abbey Road as a tea boy, then tape-op, and finally as a recording engineer, on Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow, in 1967. He was responsible for not deadening the studio, keeping its multidimensional sound, thereby allowing the installations to be used for orchestral sessions, and giving the studio its trademark sound. During the early 1980s he pioneered the CD preparation installation in the studio, while working on several outstanding projects. As the senior mastering engineer, he mastered records in stereo and surround, on CD, DVD, and SACD. Working with the Sonic Solutions suite, he has restored albums by a considerable number of artists (basically most of those who have used the Abbey Road facilities at one point or another).

She studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Nicolas Levasseur and Charles-Amable Battaille and in 1865 won the Conservatoire's first prize for singing and the first prize for opera.Kutsch and Riemens 2003, p. 454.Jewish Encyclopedia biography of Rosine Bloch She made her professional opera debut on 13 November 1865 at the Opéra's Salle Le Peletier as Azucena in Giuseppe Verdi's Le trouvère, and continued singing in that theatre, where her most notable roles included Lelia in Félicien David's Herculanum and Léonore in Gaetano Donizetti's La favorite.Pitou 1990, p. 152; Wolff 1962, p. 89; Gourret 1987, p. 48. She also sang Edwige in Gioacchino Rossini's Guillaume Tell (with Jean-Baptiste Faure as Guillaume and Marie Battu as Mathilde in 1868 and with Caroline Carvalho as Mathilde in 1870),Wolff 1962, p. 105. and Fidès in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Le prophète in 1872.Lajarte 1878, pp. 203–204. Although Bloch was striking in appearance with an ample, rich-timbred voice, it had become apparent over time that her portrayals lacked the \\"human quality\\" necessary for her to become a major star. Nevertheless, in the ensuing years she remained an honorable and respected member of the company.Pitou 1990, p. 152; Gourret 1987, p. 48. She also created two roles, Lysis in the world premiere of Jules Duprato's 1-act La Fiancée de Corinthe, which had a libretto by Camille du Locle and was first performed on 21 October 1867, but was an opera that would soon fall into obscurity after only 14 representations,Chouquet 1873, p. 423; Lajarte 1878, pp. 241–242. and Claribel in Eugène Diaz's 3-act La Coupe du Roi de Thulé, which had a libretto by L. Gallet and Edouard Blau and premiered on 10 January 1873, but would only be performed 21 times. The latter had won a competition which had been held by the Ministry of Fine Arts in 1869.Chouquet 1873, p. 425; Lajarte 1878, pp. 245–246. Early in 1870 the Théâtre Lyrique on the Place du Châtelet lost its director Jules Pasdeloup, and the artists of that company made a desperate attempt to manage the company on their own. The director of the Opéra, Émile Perrin, magnanimously granted the Lyrique the rights to perform Fromental Halévy's Charles VI, which had first been performed at the Opéra in 1843 and was last seen there in 1850. The soprano Hélène Brunet-Lafleur, who was cast in the leading role of Odette, abandoned the Lyrique's production, and Perrin allowed Bloch to take on the part. The revival was delayed after Bloch became ill with influenza, but eventually opened on 5 April 1870. It was described by a former director of the Opéra, Nestor Roqueplan, as a fiasco, but received 22 representations. However, on 31 May the Théâtre Lyrique folded, and Bloch returned to the Opéra.Walsh 1981, pp. 268–271, 322. After the Opéra moved to the Palais Garnier, Bloch repeated some of her roles in new productions at that house, including Léonore in Donizetti's La favorite (21 January 1875, 443rd representation of the opera),Wolff 1962, p. 89; Lajarte 1878, p. 165. and Fidès in the Meyerbeer's Le prophète (16 August 1876, 322nd representation of the opera).Lajarte 1878, p. 204; Wolff 1962, p. 178. She also sang Catarina Cornaro in Halévy's La reine de Chypre (16 August 1877),Wolff 1962, p. 180. Queen Gertrude in Ambroise Thomas' Hamlet (12 August 1878),Wolff 1962, p. 109. and Amneris in the Opéra's first performance of Verdi's Aida (22 March 1880), before retiring from the company.Wolff 1962, p. 27; Pitou 1990, p. 152. Verdi had considered casting Bloch as Eboli in the premiere of his opera Don Carlos in 1867, but finally selected Pauline Guéymard-Lauters for that role.Busch 1978, p. 421 note 2. The soprano Teresa Stolz, who attended the dress rehearsal for the Paris premiere of Aida with Verdi's wife, described Bloch as \\"a most beautiful Amneris: she may not be an ',' but in any case, she is much better than our two Milan Amnerises (of this year).\\"Letter of 13 March 1880 from Teresa Stolz to Katinka Evers, translated by Busch 1978, pp. 420–421. Appearances with other companies included performances at La Monnaie in Brussels (1870 and 1874), the Opéra de Monte-Carlo in Monaco (1879), and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London (1879 as Leonora in La favorite).Biography of Rosine Bloch at operissimo.com (in German)Historic Opera.Com She married on 14 May 1884 in Brussels becoming Mme S. Lévy,Pierre 1900, p. 701. but continued to perform. On 31 October 1890 she sang the role of Dalila in the Paris premiere of Camille Saint-Saëns's Samson et Dalila at the Éden-Théâtre. She died in Monte Carlo (or Nice) in 1891. References Notes Sources * Busch, Hans (1978). Verdi's Aida. The History of an Opera in Letters and Documents. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.

Harding on November 23, 1921. The Sheppard–Towner Act was the first venture of the federal government into social security legislation and the first major legislation that came to exist after the full enfranchisement of white women. This marked the political and economic power of women's issues since the bill was passed due to the organization and influence of the Children's Bureau and the newly formed Women's Joint Congressional Committee. Before its passage, most of the expansion in public health programs occurred at the state and local levels.Moehling, Carolyn M., and Melissa A. Thomasson. \\"Saving Babies: The Contribution of Sheppard-Towner to the Decline in Infant Mortality in the 1920s.\\" NBER Working Paper No. 17996 (2012): n. pag. NBER. Apr. 2012. Web. 8 Mar. 2013 The act played an important role in the medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth, the decrease in infant mortality rates, and the expansion of federal welfare legislation in the twentieth century United States. Background The political and social organization and activism by women in the Progressive Era led to the establishment of the United States Children's Bureau in the Department of Labor. The bureau was staffed and run largely by white women professionals with backgrounds in medicine, social science, and the settlement movement. Reports from the Children's Bureau that found 80% of all expectant mothers did not receive any advice or trained care.\\"The Sheppard-Towner Act: Progressivism in the 1920s: J. Stanley Lemons. The Journal of American History, vol. 55, No. 4 (Mar., 1969), pp. 776-786 The Bureau also investigated high rates of infant and maternal mortality rates. After examining 23,000 infants, they concluded that the infant mortality rate was 111.2 deaths per 1000 live births, which was higher than most other industrialized countries. The research by the Children's Bureau asserted that many infant deaths were preventable and attributed them to the lack of infant care knowledge. Women in rural areas, for example, had limited access to medical care and professional treatment. Less than half the women in a rural area in Wisconsin were attended to by doctors, and even then, the doctors sometimes arrived post-birth to cut the cord. The study also found a correlation between poverty and mortality rate. If a family earned less than $450 annually, one in six babies died within the first year; between $640 and $850, one in ten; over $1250, one in sixteen. The Children's Bureau allied with other women's groups like the Women's Joint Congressional Committee in the wake of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to advocate for an act to improve medical care for women and children. Their advocacy constitutes an example of maternalist reform on a federal level. Passage Representative Horace Mann Towner (R-Iowa) and Senator Morris Sheppard (D-Texas) introduced the bill in 1920. It was modeled after a similar bill presented in the previous session by Representative Jeannette Pickering Rankin (R-Montana) and sponsored by Julia Lathrop, head of the Children's Bureau. The Senate passed the bill in December 1920 after debates about funding and administration. The House did not vote on the bill since the hearings were held at the end of December. Opposition to the bill included the anti-suffragist Women Patriot Corporation and the American Medical Association, who feared that government intervention would lead to non-medical provisions of medical services. However, the opposition was yet not as organized as the Women's Joint Congressional Committee, Children's Bureau, and other allies. President Harding endorsed the bill in April 1921 and it was reintroduced to congress. The House passed the bill 279 to 39, and the Senate passed it 63 to 7. Provisions The act provided a guide to the instruction of hygiene of maternity and infancy care through: 1) public health nurses, visiting nurses, consultation centers, and childcare conferences; 2) the distribution of educational materials on prenatal care, and 3) the regulation and licensure of midwives. Appropriation of $1,480,000 for fiscal year 1921-1922 and $1,240,000 for the next five years ending on June 30, 1927 were made for the act. Of the funds, $5000 would go to each state with a dollar for dollar matching up to an explicit cap determined by the state's population. Costs of administering the program would not exceed $50,000. This program was administered by Children's Bureau, though the states could decide how to utilize the money themselves. Impact The Sheppard–Towner Act led to the creation of 3,000 child and maternal health care centers, many of these in rural areas, during the eight years it was in effect. =State involvement= The Children's Bureau worked extensively with state-level departments of health to advise them on how to use Sheppard-Towner funding. Participation in the program varied. States that had recently extended suffrage to women, such as North Carolina, Pennsylvania, or Alabama, tended to have higher participation levels in an effort to appeal to newly enfranchised voters. States with a longer history of women's suffrage tended to be less involved in the program, including Idaho, Colorado, and Washington. Massachusetts, Connecticut and Illinois never participated in the program. =Midwifery= At the time of the passage of the Sheppard–Towner Act, nearly half of all births in the United States were attended by midwives or other lay caretakers. The percentage was higher in the South, especially among African Americans. The Sheppard–Towner Act provided for training and licensure of midwives in an effort to decrease infant mortality, although the higher numbers of infant deaths in black and Hispanic communities were often caused by the effects of poverty rather than by the work of midwives. Public health workers' emphasis on pregnancy and childbirth as a medical process often led them to dismiss the folk traditions and knowledge of midwives, especially among African Americans in the South. Midwife licensure and associated Sheppard-Towner programs that encouraged reliance on medical professionals contributed to a significant–but not complete–decline in the practice midwifery in the United States. By 1930, midwife-attended childbirths dropped to 15% nationwide, while African-Americans in the South continued to rely heavily on midwives well into the mid-twentieth century. =Infant mortality= The overall U.S. infant mortality rate in 1922 was 76.2 deaths per 1000 live births. By the time that Sheppard-Towner was repealed in 1929, the infant mortality rate had fallen to 67.6, with a net decrease of 9.6 deaths per 1000 live births. There was already a downward trend in infant mortality during the 1920s; not all of the decrease was due to Sheppard- Towner. States that spent one standard deviation of money on \\"child-life\\", or approximately $27, reduced infant mortality on average by 2.8 deaths per 1000 live births. States that spent one standard deviation of money on health and sanitation, or approximately $188, reduced infant mortality on average by 6.27 deaths per 1000 live births. Home nurse visits reduced infant mortality on average by 1.8 deaths per 1000 live births. One standard deviation increase of the number of health centers decreased infant mortality on average by 2.25 deaths per 1000 people. An increase in 30 \\"prenatal letters\\", letters that provided information on prenatal and well-child care, decreased infant mortality on average by 0.2 deaths per 1000 live births. There were different effects on white and non-white populations of states that decided to participate in Sheppard-Towner. For whites, one standard deviation of spending on child life reduced 1.5 deaths per 1000 live births, and one standard deviation of spending on health and sanitation reduced infant mortality by 3.8 deaths per 1000 live births while for non-whites both had no statistically significant effect on reductions. Nursing visits reduced white infant mortality by 1.2 deaths per 1000 live births while non-whites with the same nursing visits had 8.7 decrease in infant mortality. With the health centers that were constructed, 1.9 deaths per 1000 live births were reduced for white infant mortality and 8.4 deaths per 1000 live births were reduced for non- white infant mortality. Finally for prenatal letters, white infant mortality was reduced by 0.2 deaths per 1000 live births and non-white infant mortality reduction was not statistically significant. Overall mortality rate would have been 0.7 and 1.9 deaths per 1000 births higher without Sheppard-Towner. That would make up 9 and 21 percent of the decline of infant mortality during the enactment of the act. Aggregate effect of Sheppard-Towner was driven primarily by the non-white populations. White infant mortality rate would have been 0.15 to 1.0 deaths higher whereas non-white rate would have been 9.9 to 13 deaths higher. Federal appropriation for Sheppard-Towner was $776,676.54, suggesting that one infant death could be prevented for between $118 and $512 in federal expenditures. Opposition and end of the act Cases brought to the Supreme Court claiming the act was unconstitutional were dismissed in 1923.Lemons, J. Stanley. \\"The Sheppard-Towner Act: Progressivism in the 1920s.\\" The Journal of American History 55, no. 4 (1969): 776-786. The act was due for renewal in 1926, but was met with more vocal, organized opposition than in 1921. The American Medical Association saw the act as a socialist threat to its professional autonomy and increased their lobbying efforts, despite the Pediatric Section of the AMA House of Delegates' endorsement of the act's renewal.\\"Harding Signs Sheppard-Towner Act–November 23, 1921.\\" American President A Reference Resource. Miller Center, Univ. of VA. Web. Retrieved 1 March 2012. The rebuking of the Pediatric Section by the full House of Delegates led to the members of the Pediatric Section establishing the American Academy of Pediatrics. In the Journal of the American Medical Association, members of the AMA also critiqued the role of lay women administrators in the Children's Bureau, arguing that the administration of mother and infant health policy should take place under the medical, predominantly male leadership of the Public Health Service. Other opponents included the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, which had supported the act in 1921, and the anti-suffragist Woman Patriot Publishing Company (formerly Woman Patriot Corporation), who accused the Sheppard-Towner bill of being a communist plot. In January 1927, a group of senators initiated a filibuster on the act, with Utah Senator William H. King arguing that the bill was championed by “…neurotic women, …social workers who obtained pathological satisfaction in interfering with the affairs of other people,…and Bolsheviks who did not care for the family and its perpetuity.” As a compromise, the Sheppard–Towner Act was extended for another two years and expired on June 30, 1929. Women's groups unsuccessfully continued to organize and revive the act in the following years. Sheppard-Towner set the framework for the inclusion of substantial provisions for maternal and infant care in the Social Security Act of 1935.

Career Brian Jones was born in Gloucester and began his career in the motorcycle industry with an apprenticeship with Douglas Motorcycles in 1951 before moving to the English Midlands to work with the BSA company who were the biggest motorcycle manufacturers in the world at the time. He also worked at the Norton Motorcycles factory where he decided to become a motorcycle designer. Norton's Managing Director at the time was legendary designer Bert Hopwood and the company was controlled by Associated Motor Cycles. Leaving a struggling AMC/Norton, Jones moved to Triumph where he worked with Doug Hele on the 650 cc Triumph Bonneville T120. Watching the Thruxton 500 endurance race for production motorcycles he saw the factory rider Percy Tait come into the pits after an hour on the track and plunge his blistered hands into a bucket of water. Jones worked with Hele on improvements to the chassis which resulted in a victory in the 750 cc Production Class at the 1969 Isle of Man TT. In 1976, the Triumph factory, with a government loan, was taken over by the workers after the new owners, NVT, had wanted to close it down. Jones had by then left to work for Lockheed. The then-chairman of the workers' co-operative, Dennis Crowder-Johnson asked him to return to Triumph, however, and Jones came back to help improve their only product, Triumph's 750 cc motorcycle, consisting of the Triumph Bonneville T140V and Triumph Tiger TR7V models. As Director of Engineering, he ensured the Bonneville's continued export to the vital USA market by making it compliant with ever-stricter emissions laws (the T140E), (finally) introduced electric starting (the T140ES) and, with Bernard Hooper's design, developed an anti-vibration framed model (T140AV). Jones also developed variants such as the economy 650 cc Triumph TR65 Thunderbird, the dual-purpose Triumph Tiger Trail (TR7T,) the eight-valve Triumph T140W TSS with Weslake and with Triumph Motorcycle America's Wayne Moulton, the Triumph T140 TSX. Jones was also involved in the development of the prototype 900 cc water-cooled, double-overhead-cam (DOHC) 'Diana' twin that the struggling co- operative hoped would attract outside investment in a last-ditch attempt to save their business. However, by 1983 the co-operative closed and Triumph was then bought by John Bloor with full motorcycle production of a new range only restarting in 1991 at Hinckley. Triumph T140 Bonneville built under licence by LF Harris with significantly more Italian and German component parts but here also with aftermarket silencers. In the meantime, Les Harris of Newton Abbot was licensed by Bloor to build the Bonneville at his works in Devon and recruited Brian Jones to oversee the new operation. Production was limited by the inability to export to the USA due to prohibitive product liability insurance rates. As well as the Bonneville production, Jones designed a 500 cc Rotax-engined Matchless single-cylinder model that did well in the UK but was never exported in volume. Bonneville production at Newton Abbot ended in 1988 and although the Matchless was successful Jones did not want to work in Harris's spares business and moved to a new incarnation of the Norton company at Shenstone, Staffordshire.

Boak House, is the site near Gore, Frederick County, Virginia, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Willa Cather was born in 1873. The log home was built in the early 19th century by her great-grandfather and has been enlarged twice. The building was previously the home of Rachel E. Boak, Cather's grandmother. Cather and her parents lived in the house only about a year before they moved to another home in Frederick County. The farmhouse was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) in 1976 and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1978. History The house was originally owned by Cather's great- grandfather, Jacob Seibert. The original portion of the home was probably built in the 1810s. A two-story frame extension on the western end of the house was added around twenty years later while an ell was probably added sometime after the Civil War. In 1869, the home and of land was conveyed to Seibert's daughter, Rachel E. Boak. Virginia Boak, her daughter, and Charles Cather were married at the house in December 1872. The following year on December 7, the couple's first child, Willa Cather, was born in the house. In 1874, Willa and her parents moved to a nearby home, Willow Shade, also listed on the NRHP. Cather's relatives began moving to Nebraska in the 1870s and her family followed in 1883, settling in Red Cloud. The house where she was born was conveyed from Cather's grandmother to a woman named S.S. Gore. Ownership of the home changed hands four more times until being purchased by Charles T. Brill in 1950. At the time of the home's historical survey taken in 1976, Brill used the building as an office and retreat. The Willa Cather Birthplace was added to the VLR on September 21, 1976, and the NRHP on November 16, 1978. A historical marker in front of the home was installed by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. The marker reads: > Here Willa Sibert Cather, the novelist, was born December 7, 1873. This > community was her home until 1883 when her family moved to Nebraska. Nearby > on Back Creek stands the old mill described in her novel Sapphira and the > Slave Girl. Architecture The vernacular building is a simple two-story log house. The rear portion of the home features a two-story frame ell extending from the center. The facade has three windows on the first floor and five windows on the second. All of the facade windows feature louvered blinds. Doors are located on the western and eastern ends of the home's facade with a simple porch attached to the western entrance. The original portion of the home includes the three bays on the eastern end. A chimney was attached to the western end of the original portion before the later extension. The chimney was incorporated into the building and the smokestack is now only visible above the roof ridge. The gable roof is covered with standing seam sheet metal with box cornices at the eaves. Most of the exterior walls are covered with weatherboards with the remaining sections covered with asbestos shingles. The underpinning of the home is made of fieldstone. Sadly, as of December 2019, the home is in a severely dilapidated condition. Before long it will be beyond saving. Each floor of the home's main section contains two large rooms while the rear ell has one large room on each floor. The ell's first floor room contains the kitchen. Many of the original details are still intact in the main section of the house such as the flooring, stairwell, and batten doors. The staircase features square balusters and a square newel. A dilapidated two- story kitchen and servants' house, possibly built in the 1930s or 1940s, is located behind the home.

The chief executive of the Order of Railway Conductors for more than 15 years, Clark served on the Interstate Commerce Commission from 1906 to 1921, and was its chairman from 1913 to 1914 and 1918 to 1921. Railway career Edgar E. Clark was born in Lima, New York on February 18, 1856. His father died when he was six, leaving him to be raised by his mother. Clark attended school at the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, remaining there until 1872. After leaving school, Clark headed west in search of work and adventure, landing in Austin, Minnesota, where he found a job as a brakeman on the Burlington, Cedar Rapids, and Northern Railway. Clark attended Williams College. He would later receive a law degree. In 1876 he moved along to points still further west, settling in Ogden, Utah, which would become his hometown. Clark married the former Lavinia Jenkins, of Ogden, Utah, in September 1880. The couple would have four children during their first ten years of marriage, two girls and two boys. Clark took a position on the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, winning promotion from brakeman to railroad conductor in 1884. Clark became active in the Order of Railway Conductors (ORC), the fraternal benefit society of conductors, and was elected Grand Senior Conductor of the ORC at its annual convention in Denver in 1888. In 1890 became Grand Chief Conductor, the chief executive of the Order. Clark would hold that position until 1906. He was succeeded as president on September 1, 1906, by Austin B. Garretson. Governmental career Dupont Circle residence of Washington, D.C. Clark involved himself in lobbying, and received credit for the 1898 enactment of a Mediation and Arbitration Act, which provided for a permanent board to settle disputes between railways and their employees. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt, apparently impressed by a speech he had given to a railwaymen's convention which Roosevelt had attended, named Clark (a Republican in politics) to the Coal Arbitration Commission to settle an ongoing strike, an appointment which excited considerable comment. In 1906, Roosevelt nominated Clark to one of two new seats on the Interstate Commerce Commission created by the Hepburn Act. Clark received a recess appointment from Roosevelt and was sworn in on July 31, 1906. He was confirmed by the Senate on December 13, 1906. President William Howard Taft attempted to reappoint Clark, but his confirmation was held up in a dispute between the lame-duck President and Congress after the 1912 elections, with the Senate determined to deny Taft any further appointments. Nonetheless, Clark was immediately reappointed as Commissioner by the new President, Woodrow Wilson, on March 5, 1913, and was confirmed by the Senate the same day. The following day, the ICC commissioners elected Clark as chairman, filling out the remainder of the one-year term which had been left vacant by the resignation of ICC Chairman Franklin Knight Lane, who had been confirmed as Secretary of the Interior. In 1918, Clark was again elected Commission chairman. While the chairmanship had been rotating, in view of Clark's long service, the practice was abandoned, and Clark remained chairman until his 1921 resignation. Later life In 1921, Clark resigned from the Commission to enter the practice of commercial law. It was stated that the reasons for his resignation were to alleviate the stress of his position, and to make provision for his family. In 1929, Clark retired from the firm of Clark & Laroe and in June moved to Monrovia, California, where he died on December 1, 1930, leaving a widow, Agnes Clark, and three sons and three daughters.

Portrait of Jan Blockx drawn by Enrico Caruso (1909, Ghent University Library) Biography Born in Antwerp, Blockx studied the piano with Frans Aerts, the organ with Joseph Callaerts and composition with Peter Benoît at the Antwerp Conservatory. When he was still a student he wrote some songs, in Flemish, which became popular. However, his musical education studies were quite irregular, and he was essentially self-taught person. Later he studied with Carl Reinecke at Leipzig. Despite the fact that he was Benoits favorite pupil, Blockx wanted to make his own way in life, independent of his teacher and the Flemish Movement. Unlike Benoit, Blockx never intended his works to have the educational, uplifting effect that was typical for the Flemish Movement. This caused tensions between student and master: despite the fact that Blockx’s work helped to spread Flemish music across the Belgian borders and even saved the Vlaamse Opera from bankruptcy, Blockx received a lot of complaints from his fellow Flemish composers for publishing his works in French and through the Parisian music publisher Heugel. In 1886 Blockx became a teacher at his Antwerp alma mater; and when Benoît died in 1901, Blockx succeeded him as director (a decision that was much contested by his colleagues despite his international reputation). He died of a stroke in Kapellenbos, near Antwerp, in 1912. Works Blockx wrote operas called Iets Vergeten, Maître Martin, Rita, De Herbergprinses, Thyl Uylenspiegel, De Bruid der Zee, De Kapel and Baldie. Later he rewrote Baldie and called it Liefdelied. He also wrote a ballet called Milenka, a pantomime called St Nicholas, an overture called Rubens, and many other works. Among his other works are the cantatas Jubelgam, De Klokke Roelandt, Het Vaderland, Die Scheldezang, Feest in der Lande, Vredesang, Op den Stroom, Het Droom van't Paradies, the symphonic poem Kermisdag and Symfonisch Drieluik.

The parish of West Walton, in the 2001 Census, had a population of 1,659, increasing to 1,731 at the 2011 Census. History The name West Walton is thought by James Rye to derive from the Old English meaning of the 'settlement by the wall' which refers to the village's proximity to a Roman sea wall or defence. West Walton was established by the time of the Norman Conquest. The village's population, land ownership and productive resources were detailed in its entry in the Domesday Book of 1085.The Domesday Book, Englands Heritage, Then and Now, Editor: Thomas Hinde,Norfolk page 196, West Walton, In the great book West Walton is recorded by the name 'Waltuna'. The parish was held by William de Warenne with the Abbot of St Peter and St Paul, Cluny from him, The Abbot of Ely before and after 1066, and Oder from Ralph de Beufour. The survey mentions ½ church, 38 salt houses and 1100 sheep. The survey also records the presence of a fishery. In the Domesday survey fractionsThe Normans in Norfolk, by Sue Margeson, Fabienne Seillier and Andrew Rogerson, (1994), p. 21, were used to indicate that the entry, in this case the church, was situated within more than one parish. Geography The village and parish of West Walton is in the western part of the county of Norfolk. The western flank of the parish is also the county border between Norfolk and Cambridgeshire and is also the course of the River Nene. On the southern flank is the parish of Walsoken. To the north is Walpole and to the east is Marshland St James. The village is west-north-west of Norwich, west-south-west of King's Lynn and north of London and its location makes it, along with Walsoken, the most westerly village in Norfolk. The nearest town is Wisbech which is south of the village. The nearest railway station is at Watlington, Norfolk for the Fen Line which runs between King's Lynn and Cambridge. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. Governance For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk.

In the early 1850s, Edward Tatnall of Wilmington, Delaware was given an English recipe for making matches by a business acquaintance, William R. Smith. In 1853, Tatnall attempted to turn the recipe into a business at Market Street Bridge over Brandywine Creek in Wilmington.“Swift & Courtney & Beecher,” in Hobby History, November/December 2002, at “The Matchcover Vault: A Resource Site For Matchcover Collectors.” The following historical information up to the merger of Swift & Courtney & Beecher with Diamond Match Company is from this source. The first matches ignited with the slightest friction, a problem Tatnall solved by reducing the phosporous content by 25 percent. Company background In the next few years, Tatnall was joined by a young Englishman, Henry Coughtrey, who was an experienced match maker, and who changed his name to Courtney. During a business depression in 1857, Tatnall closed his plant, but Courtney continued to experiment with improvements to the safety and quality of his own matches. In 1860, William H. Swift joined Tatnall’s firm to provide clerical and financial services. Though Swift saw potential in Courtney’s innovations, Tatnall felt he had spent enough on the match business and turned the business over to Courtney and Swift for nothing.The relationship between the Tatnall and Swift families, however, continued. Joseph Swift (IV) would later join the match making business with his brother, William, and Edward Tatnall’s grandson, Henry Lea Tatnall, Jr., would marry Joseph Swift’s daughter, Francis Dorr Swift in October, 1897. In 1861, the two of them created the Swift & Courtney Company. They called their new matches Diamond State Parlor Matches, using one of the popular nicknames for the state of Delaware. Demand during the Civil War created a large and growing market for Swift & Courtney matches. In order to meet an expanding need for production even after the Civil War, the company merged with Beecher & Sons of New Haven, Connecticut in 1870 to create the Swift & Courtney & Beecher Company. Incorporated in Connecticut, manufacturing remained in Wilmington, Delaware. Later in 1870, the company purchased the match business of Thomas Allen & Company of St. Louis, Missouri. In 1872, they bought McGiugan & Daily of Philadelphia, and made contracts with Joseph Loehy of New York City and Charles Busch of Trenton, New Jersey.Ibid., “Swift & Courtney & Beecher.” In 1880, everything was sold to the Barber Match Company of Akron, Ohio, founded by O.C. Barber. Barber re-named the company after the established trade name of its product, creating the Diamond Match Company. Following the Panic of 1893, Barber moved the Diamond Match Company factory in Akron to the adjacent town of his own creation, Barberton in an effort to revive the town's flagging economy. He turned the abandoned Akron match factory into a rubber products factory (see Diamond Rubber Company). The Diamond Match Company was the largest manufacturer of matches in the United States in the late nineteenth century. It became a part of the Kreuger concern in 1932, when Ivar Kreuger took control of more than 52% of the shares. The Diamond Match Company operated plants at Barberton, Ohio; Wilmington, Delaware (now located in the East Brandywine Historic District); Barber, California (later Chico); Springfield, Massachusetts and Cloquet, Minnesota. Diamond was purchased by Jarden in 2003 after entering bankruptcy in 2001, and has been owned by Newell Brands since Newell Rubbermaid's acquisition of the company in a merger in 2016. In 2017, Newell sold Diamond (except the cutlery line) to Royal Oak Enterprises. In the twenty-first century, Diamond remains America's leading producer of matches, producing some twelve billion a year.http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Diamond_Match_Company?rec=882 It also produces plastic cutlery and other wood products.http://www.diamondbrands.com/ California railroads Logging railway north of town with Southern Pacific connection to the south The Diamond Match Company built a wood processing mill in 1902 at Stirling City, California. A standard gauge railroad was built from Stirling City to their manufacturing plant in Chico for operation by Southern Pacific; and Diamond Match Company also built and operated metre-gauge railway branches to bring logs into Stirling City from surrounding forests. The company became a pioneering user of treated railroad ties by building a tie- manufacturing plant at Stirling City. Later, logging branches were built to standard gauge; and the company was operating three Lima Locomotive Works Shay locomotives and one built by Willamette Iron and Steel Works when the logging branches were abandoned in 1952. Diamond Match Company also built an electrified tram line to transport employees to and from work. The Chico Electric Railway running along 9th Street and Main Street began operations in 1904, and became the northern terminus of the Sacramento Northern Railway in 1906.

Beverley Beach is now a county park. In 2019 Maryland's Natural Resources Department mandated that the Beverley Beach Community Association open the beachfront to the public. Parking for the beach is only available at the main entrance at Beverly Triton Nature Park at 1202 Triton Beach Road Edgewater, MD 21037. Parking in the community to access the park is prohibited. History Edgar Kalb, a successful Baltimore attorney, opened Beverly Beach in 1925. He, along with some family members, bought neighboring Ford Beach (renamed Triton Beach) in 1942. The land was platted for more than a hundred single-family homes, and the plat was named Beverley Beach. The origin of the name is unclear, but (with the additional 'e') is likely the surname of a relative or friend. The property is located in the community of Mayo, at the eastern terminus of Highway 214. Kalb reserved the bayfront property for an exclusive day resort attraction, which was also named Beverley Beach, and for his own personal residence. The portion of the shore with a sandy bottom was developed for members of Beverley Beach, while the remainder of the shore (with a muck bottom) was the site of his personal residence, and was available for expansion of the day resort. It is likely (but undocumented) that Kalb, with his wealth and connections, convinced Anne Arundel authorities to allow slot machines in the County. The approval came in 1943 and was a boon to Kalb's day resort. Kalb built three 'pavilions': two with a covered breezeway and one standalone just north of the others. The standalone was divided into two sections, with lockers and showers for patrons who waded into the sandy-bottom Chesapeake Bay. One of the other pavilions contained a growing number of slot machines and other coin-operated devices, while the southernmost pavilion had two refreshment stands (serving a limited menu of fast food, beer, and soft drinks), and a generous quantity of tables and chairs for dining. At the very north end, there was a dance floor and a bandstand, very popular with local young people on Fridays, Saturdays, and holiday eves. In the late 1940s, the dance area was converted into a bingo hall, and the dining area was converted into more slots and other coin- operated devices. A swing set was added in the open area to the south. The swimming area extended along some of beachfront, from the northern border of the subdivision to an area south of the Kalb residence, and in a roughly truncated semi-circle some 100–120 feet into the Chesapeake. About 2/3 of the distance from the shore were some 7-10 floats, which were square wood platforms supported by air-filled 55-gallon drums. One or two lifeguards were stationed on floats, each with a small wooden dinghy or small wooden scow for getting to and from shore, and for assisting swimmers who got themselves into trouble. In late summer, the warm Chesapeake waters were plagued with sea nettles, small stinging jellyfish. Kalb combatted these with nettle nets which were erected around the swimming area (which was roughly a truncated semi- circle which extended perhaps 100–120 feet into the Chesapeake). The nettle nets were actually panels of wire mesh (with quarter-inch openings) installed between semi-permanent wood pilings in May and removed into storage each September. Each evening, a lifeguard would be tasked with hanging hurricane lanterns on some of the pilings, to warn boaters of the obstruction. Each morning, they would be taken down, refueled, wicks trimmed, and stored until evening. It was not considered to be an unpleasant duty, as the lifeguards took the opportunity to harvest soft-shelled crabs which were often found clinging to the nettle nets. On weekends during its peak, Beverley Beach drew hundreds of cars and several busloads of people from the Washington and Baltimore areas. It was one of the few locations to which Russians were allowed to travel. The resort season extended from the first week in June to Labor Day. At that time, other times of the year were too cool or cold for swimming or sunbathing. Segregation in Maryland was strong in the forties and early fifties, and although Beverley Beach employed many of Mayo's black community, they were not permitted in the resort except as employees. The resort avoided legal requirements by admitting only members, and memberships (which cost fifty cents) were issued at the entrance. In the fifties, a court order rejected the membership subterfuge and required that blacks be permitted to use the resort. Rather than accede to the court order, Kalb closed the resort in 1968.

Ponder (born 1941) is a noted malacologist from New Zealand who has named and described many marine and freshwater animals, especially micromolluscs. He graduated with an MSc, PhD and DSc from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Ponder was the principal research scientist in the malacology section of the Australian Museum, Sydney, Australia and helped to build up the museum's mollusc collection so that it became one of the most extensive of its kind in the world. Ponder retired from this post after a long career of more than forty years of research on molluscs, and is now an Honorary Fellow. He has been the president of the Society of Australian Systematic Biologists, and was the managing editor of the journal Molluscan Research of the Malacological Society of Australasia.Malacological Society of Australasia for 8 years. Early in his career, in 1964, he worked on Antarctic collections together with Richard Dell and Alan Beu, resulting in a major monograph on the Antarctic bivalves, chitons and scaphopods. Ponder is the author of more than 300 research publications. Many of these are on the subjects of the freshwater molluscs of Australia, and on invertebrate conservation. One major contribution was a taxonomy of the Gastropoda, which he published together with David R. Lindberg in 1997.Ponder W. & Lindberg D. R. 1997. Towards a phylogeny of gastropod molluscs; an analysis using morphological characters. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 119: 83-265. This was the last major publication on the taxonomy of the Gastropoda that was based on the morphology of snails and slugs (their internal and external shapes and forms), and did not take into account any analysis of their DNA or RNA.

It was the main airport for Bristol and the surrounding area. During World War II, it was one of the few civil airports in Europe that remained operational, enabling air connections to Lisbon and Shannon and onwards to the United States. The airport closed in 1957, with services transferred to the former RAF Lulsgate Bottom. The former airfield is now occupied by a sports centre, trading estates and retail parks. The South Bristol Community Hospital opened on the site in 2012. Early history In 1929, the Corporation of the City of Bristol bought of farmland to the south of the city, near Whitchurch, for a new municipal airport. On 31 May 1930, the airport was officially opened by Prince George, Duke of Kent. In its first year of operation, the airport handled 915 passengers, and by 1939 it handled 4,000 passengers. The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club relocated from Filton Airfield, and together with Bristol Corporation, managed the facilities.Wakefield, 1-3 The first buildings were a hangar, a clubhouse for the flying club, and an aircraft showroom.Wakefield, 11 Early services were an \\"air ferry\\" to Cardiff, operated by Norman Edgar & Co, and flights to Torquay and Teignmouth. By 1932, two air taxi firms were based at the airport.Wakefield, 33 By 1934, Bristol Air Taxis was joined by Railway Air Services, a subsidiary of Imperial Airways, offering connections to Plymouth, Birmingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool.Wakefield, 49-51 In July 1935, a new terminal building was opened, and regular international services started with flights on the Cardiff-Whitchurch-Le Touquet-Paris Le Bourget route.Wakefield, 55 In 1936 Norman Edgar moved to the new airport at Weston- super-Mare. The company had been renamed Norman Edgar (Western Airways) Ltd, and in 1938 it was taken over by the Straight Corporation, headed by Whitney Straight who renamed it Western Airways, Ltd. In 1937, Irish Sea Airways (precursor of Aer Lingus), and Great Western and Southern Airlines commenced operations from Whitchurch.Wakefield, 62-65 In July 1938, the Government formed a Civil Air Guard to train pilots for what was widely seen as the forthcoming war. The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club was one of the training organisations enlisted in this effort, and in addition No. 33 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School was established at Whitchurch to prepare RAFVR pilots.Wakefield, 74 In August 1938, Frank Barnwell, the chief designer of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, died when an ultralight monoplane he had designed and built himself, the Barnwell B.S.W., struck a bump when taking off and stalled, crashing onto a nearby road.Flight 11 August 1938 (Obituary Frank Barnwell) World War II A BOAC de Havilland Albatross at Whitchurch, circa 1941 In late August 1939, the airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry, and was declared a Restricted Area. Starting on 1 September 1939, 59 aircraft belonging to Imperial Airways and British Airways Ltd were evacuated from Croydon Airport and Heston Aerodrome to Whitchurch. The two airlines, which were in the process of merging to form British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), became the nucleus of National Air Communications (NAC), formed to undertake wartime air transport work.Wakefield, 82-83 Airport security was increased, with barbed wire fencing and Air Ministry police posts. During the next two years, an east-west tarmac runway and taxiways were constructed.Wakefield, 85-90 In late 1939, civilian flights resumed.Wakefield, 89 From September 1940, six aircraft of the Dutch airline KLM, which had escaped to Britain after the German invasion of the Netherlands, were also based at Whitchurch. These aircraft with their Dutch crews operated flights to Lisbon in neutral Portugal, under charter to BOAC.Wakefield, 91-93 The Air Transport Auxiliary established No. 2 Ferry Pilots Pool (FPP) at Whitchurch during 1940. No. 2 FPP was mainly concerned with ferrying Blenheims, Beaufighters and Beauforts built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company at Filton; Hurricanes built by the Gloster Aircraft Company at Brockworth, Gloucestershire and Whirlwinds and Spitfires produced by Westland Aircraft at Yeovil in Somerset.Wakefield, 93-94 The unit was disbanded in 1945. During 1942–1943, civil services were developed to Shannon Airport and an extension of the Lisbon route to Gibraltar, with Lisbon and Shannon providing connections to the United States. Famous passengers who used these services included Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Eleanor Roosevelt.Wakefield, 120-124 On 1 June 1943, BOAC Flight 777 was shot down en route to Whitchurch from Lisbon, with the loss of four Dutch crew and 13 passengers, including the actor Leslie Howard.Wakefield, 107–108 In November 1944, BOAC moved out to Hurn Airport, Bournemouth, because the runways there were capable of accommodating larger aircraft, and the success of the Invasion of Normandy had lessened the danger from the Luftwaffe.Wakefield, 131 Post war After the war, the airport came under the control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. A number of flying clubs used the airport but it did not attract many scheduled services; from 1953, Morton Air Services operated flights to the Channel Islands, the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man, whilst Cambrian Airways operated both domestic and international flights to France.Wakefield, 147-153 The airport had become too small for airline operations, with surrounding housing estates limiting runway extension, so a new site at the former RAF Lulsgate Bottom was opened in May 1957 as Bristol Airport.Wakefield, 153-154 In 1957, flying ceased at Whitchurch, and in 1959 the airfield was re-opened as Whitchurch Circuit, a car racing circuit holding Formula Two and Formula Three races. Over the years, the area has been developed as housing and trading estates known as Hengrove Park, although part of the main runway still exists. In 1993, a Cessna 152 aircraft made an emergency landing there, short of fuel. In 2009, it was announced that part of the former airfield was to be developed as South Bristol Community Hospital, a Skills Academy and a leisure centre.

He was born as Johann Grafenauer, as an illegitimate child of Michael Grafenauer and Elisabeth Flaschberger, in the village of Micheldorf () near Hermagor in Carinthia, now part of Austria.Register of births, Egg/Brdo, 1858-1880, p. 322. At that time, Micheldorf was the westernmost Slovene- inhabited village, not only in Carinthia, but in all the Slovene ethnic territory. His father was a local Slovene cultural activist, and his uncle, Franc Grafenauer, was a Slovene politician and member of the Austrian Imperial Council. After finishing high school in Villach in 1900, he enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied Slavic and German philology. Between 1904 and 1908, he taught at the high school in Kranj and from 1908 in Ljubljana. He obtained a PhD at the University of Vienna in 1917 and a habilitation at the University of Zagreb in 1919. Grafenauer published most of his works in the period between World War I and World War II. He mostly researched the medieval literature in the Slovene Lands, advancing a thesis on an uninterrupted tradition of vernacular literature in Slovene during this period. Among his most important works is a thorough analysis of the Freising manuscripts. After 1940, he dedicated himself almost exclusively to the research of Slovene folk poetry. Many of his articles were published in the prestigious Catholic cultural magazine Dom in svet. In 1940, he became a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He died in Ljubljana. He was the father of the historian Bogo Grafenauer and the designer Marija Grafenauer Vogelnik.

HistoryThe beginning= Compass Point Studios was built in 1977 in Nassau, Bahamas, by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records. Stricto Sensu was a recording band that Blackwell put together in 1980, based on Jamaican (reggae) foundation shaped around Sly and Robbie,Sly & Robbie were signed to Island Records in the 1970s with Sly Dunbar (drums), Robbie Shakespeare (bass), joined by Mikey Chung (guitar) and Uziah \\"Sticky\\" Thompson (percussion), with British rock flavour brought by Barry Reynolds (guitar, of Marianne Faithfull's Broken English fameM. Faithfull was signed to Island Records in the 1970s.), spiced up by synth-dominated keyboards from French-African Wally BadarouNicknamed Prophet, for his near-exclusive use of the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 synthesizer. (of burgeoning Level 42), and Tyrone Downie later (keyboards of The Wailers fame). Together, under Blackwell's direction, and building on co- producer Alex Sadkin's skills at engineering and mixing, delivered a highly praised and distinct sound - for what are today viewed as seminal albums by Grace Jones and Joe Cocker.G. Jones Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing and Living My Life / J. Cocker Sheffield Steel\\"Broken English\\" excerpt from Faithfull: An Autobiography / David Dalton / Little, Brown & Co, New-York This core combination of talent would later be called the Compass Point All Stars (sometimes spelled Allstars). \\"I wanted a new, progressive-sounding band\\" said Blackwell, \\"a Jamaican rhythm section with an edgy mid-range and a brilliant synth player. And I got what I wanted, fortunately\\".\\"Keep On Running – The Story of Island Records\\" by Chris Salewicz, p. 135. Interview by David Katz. =The rise= Another prestigious resident of this early period was Robert Palmer, who augmented the CPAS sound on Joe Cocker's project.Adding backing vocals on \\"Sweet Little Woman\\", along with Jimmy Cliff. Sly and Robbie went on to use some of the CPAS for Black Uhuru and Gwen Guthrie projects, eventually adding Darryl Thompson, Spaceman Patterson, and Monte Brown (guitars) to the core of the band. An attempt to record a band album was made, but ended up as Sly and Robbie's Language Barrier Album. The stars would eventually encompass all Compass Point resident stars of the era, most notably Chris Franz (drums) and Tina Weymouth (bass) of Talking Heads. Together with co-producer Steven Stanley engineering and mixing, they would start the Tom Tom Club. Brit engineer Andy Lyden came to work on a Badarou solo project, and became a resident engineer as well. The core of CPAS resided in a condominium called Tip-Top, at top of the hill behind the studio. It was a highly productive body by then, even appealing to business giants, as reported by Wally Badarou on his website: \\"The Compass Point All Stars (as we ended up being called) even had a try at godfather of soul, Mr Dynamite, James Brown, yes. But that one did not work out, mainly due to publishing disputes\\". =A larger family= A musical community was born,Chapter 45 from Nathalie Delon: Pleure pas, c'est pas grave / Flammarion and the Compass Point All Stars label would eventually extend throughout the 1980s to anything either originating from Compass Point Studios, productions by Bill Laswell and remixes by Larry Levan and François K Kevorkian included; or somewhat related to what went on over there, from resident or non-resident artists, regardless of genre and sonic identity, starting back from The B-52's. This largo sensu acception has been displayed on compilations such as Funky Nassau/The Compass Point Story/1980-1986 released by Strut Records, incorporating works by Chaz Jankel, Cristina, Will Powers, Guy Cuevas, along with extensive interviews by David Katz: \\"I don't believe anything could ever sum it up\\" said Wally Badarou of Compass Point's heyday, \\"like nothing could ever sum up Motown or Stax sounds: the studio itself, the engineers, the producers, the artists, the vibes of the time, and only the specific combination of elements does the job\\".\\"Keep On Running – The Story of Island Records\\" by Chris Salewicz, p 135. Hard rock acts such as AC/DC and Iron Maiden made very successful recordings at Compass Point, but were never labelled \\"Compass Point All Stars\\". Conversely, initial CPAS members found themselves producing numerous projects abroad, for the likes of Foreigner, Power Station, Marianne Faithfull or Valerie Lagrange. =The 1990s= Despite the overall excitement for what was produced over there, the experience didn't last past the early 1990s mainly, because of personal agendas. About half of the greatest recordings that took place were hardly planned in detail. Things were done in a constant happening fashion most of the time, for the groove to rule, sometimes to the cost of efficiency. Virtuoso Alex Sadkin no longer was there,Died in a car crash in 1987. and Blackwell's growing interests in other ventures did not allow the momentum to sustain any further.Chris Blackwell had longed for the movie business for quite some time. The studio itself went through rough times in the early 1990s, only to be successfully salvaged by producer Terry Manning and his wife Sherrie: a long list of prestigious personae, from Julio Iglesias, Diana Ross, Celine Dion, Sade to Mariah Carey, has kept the studio's spirit high ever since. =2006 and beyond= CPAS members kept busy individually nonetheless. They never did re-unite physically in a recording studio but, thanks to technology, they collaborated remotely on half a dozen projects since the mid-2000s. Those projects include Warrior by ex-Black Uhuru Michael Rose, and Grace Jones' Hurricane which got the whole of the original line-up re-united somehow. =CPAS Live= In 1987, for Island Records 25th belated anniversary, some of the initial CPAS performed live for the first time, backing Eric Clapton on \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\". Mikey Chung and Sticky Thompson did not participate. The event took place at Pinewood Studios dubbing stage, UK.

The district had the authority to sell bonds backed by real estate taxes in the counties served by the Denver and Salt Lake Railway, which was the original railroad tenant of the tunnel. The district was originally governed by a five-member elected commission and existed from 1922 until 1998.  Controversy and dissolution of the commission  The bonds for the tunnel were retired in December 1983. However, the district continued to collect taxes for another year, resulting in a fund of excess cash of approximately $1 million. In 1990, a group of activist commissioners were elected who proceeded to use the resources at their disposal to sue the Winter Park Resort, the Colorado Arlberg Club and the City and County of Denver in order to represent the public interest against perceived abuses by powerful private interests. In 1991 and 1992 the commission delayed a lease to the Southern Pacific Railroad for using the railroad tunnel for fiber optic cables. The commission began to agitate to recover money from Winter Park Resort to pay for land leased from the commission, known as the Evans Tract. By 1994, the commission was demanding rents and threatened to evict the ski resort and build a \\"Taco Bell\\". Eventually, the resort agreed to purchase the land for $2 million (in 1996). Because of these challenges, the railroad and the ski area join forces in 1996 to push forward a bill in the state legislature to dissolve the commission. The legislature passed the act in 1997. The bill specified that new commissioners would be named by the Governor (Roy Romer) to handle the liquidation of the commission and the transfer of assets to the state. Before this process was set in motion, the existing commissioners defiantly threatened to vote the commission out of existence at their final meeting before the new commission would be seated. However, the motion ultimately failed to pass, perhaps because the commissioners feared being sued over the action. In January 1998, the newly seated commissioners sold the water tunnel to the Denver Water Board for $7 million and put the railroad tunnel up for sale. There were no offers, though. The railroad had the right of first refusal and to match any offer. Moreover, it had a lease lasting until 2025 that had little monetary value to the owner of the tunnel. The remaining assets of the commission were transferred to the state and the commission ceased to exist in early 1998.

Born in Genoa, he was apprenticed to Filippo Parodi in 1680; Parodi's influence is clear in his first pre-1689 work, a Small Satyr in marble. Nearly unavoidably, he was also influenced by the work of Pierre Puget. He went to Rome in 1688, remaining there until his death; a 1692 relief of Three Men in the Fiery Furnace won first prize in all three sculpture classes at the Accademia di San Luca. In 1699, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni appointed de' Rossi court sculptor in the Palazzo della Cancelleria, Rome, and put him in charge of making the Tomb of Pope Alexander VIII, Ottoboni's granduncle, in St. Peter's Basilica (in parts finished after de' Rossi's death). Another important work is the apostle Saint James the Less in St. John Lateran, Rome (1705–11). The commemorative Bust of Arcangelo Corelli (died 1713) in the Protomoteca Capitolina of the Palazzo del Senatore of the Campidoglio, Rome, is also attributed to de' Rossi. De' Rossi was said to be close friends with Pierre Le Gros. With a promising career ahead, Angelo de' Rossi died prematurely in Rome.

In 1947, the Byrne Organization made news when it set up a prefabrication shop on the 300-acre site and churned out parts for all 1,200 homes at once. The houses featured welded steel frames which formed the basis of a structure using other materials. Outside walls were a choice of brick, shingle, or aluminum siding over redwood. Inside walls were plaster. The houses were constructed in two different styles with three or four rooms on a concrete slab, which sold for $6,900. The community was one of largest prefabricated developments in America. Their construction marked the start of phenomenal post-World War II suburbanization of previously rural Anne Arundel County. Most homes were three-bedroom and were front facing the street. A very few were side facing the street and a small number were two-bedroom units. The Governor Ritchie Highway split the community into East and West sections. The West section consisted of primarily rental units, whereas the East section homes were owned. Heating was by infloor radiant heat. The community had its own artesian well water plant. It shared an elementary school with the community of Glen Gardens in Glen Bernie and was therefore called “Glen”dale”. Community street names were all of British derivation. They ran alphabetically from North to South on both the East and West sides but were different on each side. The needs of the new community's more than 5,000 people were first served by a strip shopping center. Harundale Mall, reportedly the first enclosed shopping mall east of the Mississippi River, was opened in 1958.

History In the early 1900s, oriental rug salesman William Cochran joined a group that planned to build an amusement park on what was Startzman Farm, outside of Annapolis. That plan fell through. In 1914, there was a place called Sherwood Forest where Cochran began clearing trees to build a bucolic summer resort for middle-class families. 341 homes were built in the planned community along with a golf course, club house, softball field, general store, post office, swimming pool, bowling alley, library, pier, marina, and tennis courts. Homes sites in the community are leased for 99 years, from the community association. Demand for the homes is high and most of these homes, when available, are leased by current residents or their relatives. Approval to lease a home site requires sponsorship from current residents. Culture The community, which is gated, is split in terms of control between the Sherwood Forest Club, and the Sherwood Forest Company. The Club controls the community activities and bylaws of the community, while the Sherwood Forest Company has control of maintenance of the roads, piers, amenities, waterfront and other physical aspects of the community. The community has restrictive bylaws intended to ensure the cottages and homes within the community blend into the surrounding woods. Houses can be painted brown, green and some limited homes painted white, with green being a shade known as \\"Sherwood Green\\" developed by Bruning Paint Co. in Baltimore. The 9-hole Sherwood Forest Golf Course was designed by Herbert Strong and opened in 1919.

When the heart is continuously stimulated via the vagus nerve, initially there is stoppage of heart beat.

History The land was originally a tract of land called Two Farms.Leavitt, Donald M. \\"Westover\\". Maryland Historical Sites Inventory. Maryland Historical Trust. July 1979. Later called Westover, Evan Thomas inherited the land from his father, Samuel Thomas, in 1783. Evan Thomas leased the land to Thomas Brown for 72 pounds per year. A house was built on the land in 1810, which still stands today across from Robin Hood Swim Club.Siegal, Ann Cameron. \\"Neighborhood Offers An Everyday Respite\\". The Washington Post. July 3, 1999. p. G1. The house was built with one-foot-thick brick walls with ox blood-based mortar. It has remnants of slave quarters and an icehouse, Occupants drank water from a spring that was located where the Robin Hood Swim Club's pool is now. The water was filtered through a sand-filled channel called a race, pumped to the house with a hydraulic ram, and stored in a 40-foot-tall wood tower. Evan Thomas sold the land to William Culver in 1816. Brothers John and Romulus Culver inherited the property when their father died in 1824. Then living in Kentucky, John Culver had no interest in the land and sold his portion of the land to Francis Valdenar in 1824; Romulus Culver later sold his portion to Valdenar in 1833. Valdenar was a farmer and a Commissioner of Montgomery County. When Montgomery County and Prince George's County disputed their border, Valdenar helped define the boundary separating the two counties. Valdenar mortgaged the property in 1870. When Valdenar could not meet the mortgage payments, the property was sold at a public auction to Henry and Mary Bradley in 1876, and they gave it to their son William Bradley later that year. A successful farmer, William Bradley built an elaborate Queen Anne-style addition to the house. William Bradley died in 1897, and John Bliler bought the property from Bradley's widow Mary Bradley by way of a mortgage in 1926. Bliler defaulted on the mortgage, and Mary Bradley bought back the property at a public auction in 1929. Mary Bradley sold the property to a developer in 1950, but she inserted a clause in the deed stating that she could continue to live in the house for free for the rest of her life. The deed also stated that she had the right to chop firewood on the land and she could walk her dogs on the land whenever she liked. Further, the deed stated that if the developer were to sell the portion of the land surrounding the house, she would receive half the proceeds of the sale. The house has been listed on the Montgomery County Master Plan for Historic Preservation. Sherwood Forest was developed by Kahn Construction Corporation.\\"The State of Real Estate\\".

Originally formed in 1966 after a split with the Communist Party of Brazil, it later merged with the October 8th Revolutionary Movement in 1981, from which it split in 1995. It is a member of the International Conference of Marxist- Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle) (ICMLPO), an organization of anti-revisionist and Hoxhaist parties. As the party is not registered in Brazil's Superior Electoral Court, its members cannot run for public office. History Unhappy with the Communist Party of Brazil's (PCdoB) \\"revisionist\\" stance on the direction of the Soviet Union, a group of PCdoB members left the party and formed the Revolutionary Communist Party (PCR) in 1966. The PCR maintained that the PCdoB had abandoned Leninism in favor of Soviet revisionism. Brazil had fallen under a right-wing military dictatorship in 1964. Supported by the United States in the Cold War as a strong opponent to communism, the dictatorship committed numerous human rights abuses, including torture, towards suspected communists and other political subversives. Despite the danger, the PCR remained committed to the armed struggle against the government. The party was instrumental in organizing labor strikes and student demonstrations, but they also engaged in more destructive activities such as burning government-owned sugarcane fields. The party was partially dismantled in the early-1970s after a brutal torture campaign was waged by the government against suspected communists and leftist political parties. The party's leader, Amaro Luiz de Carvalho, was arrested by the authorities. Several other prominent party members were murdered. This culminated with the arrest of Carvalho's successor, Edival Nunes Cajá, on May 12, 1978. In response, more than 12,000 students from the Federal University of Pernambuco went on strike in Recife, where Cajá was being held. The student protest eventually procured his release, although he was arrested again soon afterwards for publicly detailing the torture he had suffered while in prison. He would not be permanently released until June 1, 1979. In July 1981, due to the limited success of PCR resistance operations against the government, the party made the decision to merge with the October 8th Revolutionary Movement (MR-8), an urban guerrilla organization that had likewise split from the PCdoB years earlier. MR-8 also publicly declared itself Marxist-Leninist, but its \\"bourgeois\\" organizational structure and affinity toward \\"bourgeois nationalism\\" led to serious disagreements with the former members of the PCR. After internal struggles within the party, the PCR elected to split with MR-8 in 1995, resulting in the re-foundation of the party. The re-founded party established a youth wing, known as the Youth Union Rebellion (Portuguese: União da Juventude Rebelião) (UJR). The PCR held its Second Congress in 1998, which resulted in an overhaul of its statutes. The party remained ideologically devoted to Marxism-Leninism, but it adopted a much more extensive theoretical approach to its methods, contrasting with the previous statutes that regarded the armed struggle as its top priority. The re- foundation of the party came well after the end of military rule, so the party decided to take advantage of the press freedom that hadn't existed before the merger. The first issue of the theoretical organ of the party, The Truth, was published in December 1998. In 2004, the PCR became a member of the International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle) (ICMLPO), an organization of anti-revisionist and Hoxhaist parties throughout the world. From then on it would also contribute to the theoretical organ of the ICMLPO, Unity & Struggle, which is published biannually.

The Argyleshire hunters, weary with the chase, and returning in quest of some habitation...met little James nearly opposite the small island on which his hut was situated, and inquiring of him what Magpie had built his nest on that island, he answered, 'One that hath scorned all manner of greedy hawks, from whatever quarter they might chance to come'. 'Tell the magpie from us (said the hunters) that we are no less disposed to hawk than to hunt around his nest; and tell him further, that we shall soon be on this way again, and mean to visit the nest of this vain chatterer: perhaps our hawks may not impress him with a mean opinion of their skill and dexterity in seizing their prey. Little James, somewhat nettled at the threatened visitation, peevishly replied; 'it may happen, likewise, that this chattering magpie, by the time your hawks have arrived within sight of his nest, by a singular power which he has over the hawks of these wooded mountains and glens, having called them in council, they may be prevailed on to suffer no strange hawks to infringe on their liberties, at least to within the range that they and their ancestors have for a length of time been accustomed.' So saying, they parted. In due time the Campbells kept their word; and Little James, having gathered his people from the various glens over which his influence extended, gave the meeting to the Argyleshire party in so warm a manner, that few returned to give an account of the hawking match for which they so merrily departed.

Corlette (1911-1977) was an English architect Per notes from a conversation with Christopher Reynolds, 25 March 2009. who, in 1949, founded the private English-style boarding school Aiglon College in Switzerland. The school is registered as a not-for-profit charitable institution, with an international student intake. Prior to founding Aiglon, Corlette was a teacher at Gordonstoun, a private school in Scotland, and he included some of that school's educational ideas in the formation of Aiglon. Early years Corlette, born John Hubert Christian Corlette on 21 June 1911,Per notes from a conversation with Joyce Lowe, 18 April 2009. was the son of Australian architect Hubert C Corlette and his wife, Florence Gwynedd Davies-Berrington. As a teenager, he attended Stowe School, in Buckinghamshire, England. Because of ill health (he had contracted pneumonia five times), he was advised to find a healthier environment, and it was recommended that he attend a school in Switzerland where the high altitude and drier air might assist his recovery; this is how he came to go to school in the alpine village of Chesières, Villars-sur-Ollon. University life and first decade of employment Corlette studied Philosophy, Politics, Economics and History at Exeter College, Oxford, left to practice as an architect, and then returned to complete his degree in 1943.Teddy Senn, Aiglon 50 plus (1949–1999), 2005 (unpublished history of Aiglon) Finding that he was drawn to education, he taught at The College at South Leigh and Gordonstoun which he left due to a difference of opinion with its founder Kurt Hahn. Founding of Aiglon College In 1949 Corlette opened his school in Chesières, the same village where he had gone to school as a teen-ager. Like his mentor Kurt Hahn, Corlette wrote no books to guide future generations in the creation of a curriculum. His speeches, like those of Hahn's, guide the reader away from a focus on curriculum and textbooks and toward the use of philosophy and environment to improve \\"the whole man.” The following extracts from a speech given by Corlette at Aiglon's end-of-term ceremony in July 1973 help illustrate his vision for the school. At the time of delivering this address, the school had expanded to nearly 300 students and had introduced co-education. However, the precepts that guided the early years of the school were still present 25 years after its foundation in 1949.– “Writings” * Education should be more than academics. We believe that the goal of education is, or should be, the development of the spiritual man, that is of that part of each one of us which, with development and training, is capable of a vision or direct apprehension of the purpose of life, of the true nature of ourselves, of the world in which we live and of such other worlds or states of being as may exist besides. * Standards of behaviour should be set by the school. * Another of our basic principles is that we believe that it is the business of those who direct the school, first to set the standards which they believe the students should be aiming at, and state them in no equivocal fashion, and secondly that they should provide a method of grading for each aspect which will enable the student to know what progress the school authorities think he is making. This grading should, if necessary and where possible, be accompanied by explanations which will help the student to understand his assessment and plan his future progress. * In other words, “tolerance of the beliefs of others” does not mean that there is a relativistic “any standards will do” approach to teaching. Multiculturalism does not connote a lack of universal standards. * Education requires teachers to look beyond academics, even if the judgments might be regarded as “subjective.” This is no reason for teachers to avoid the responsibility of judging their pupils' work and progress, moreover this is precisely how promotion is accorded to us in real life outside school. * A rank system or similar structure that rewards good behaviour is central to the school’s method. It charts the course of the development of the boy or girl as regards his character, sense of responsibility, maturity and general development in relation to the basic standards of conduct and morality which we lay down and which are derived, as far as we are able to understand them, from the teachings of Jesus Christ and other great teachers. This assessment has come to be known here as the Rank System, and is absolutely basic to the idea of education at Aiglon. Note: Corlette did not like the word “rank” as it held unintended military overtones. * A system of rewarding merit outside the classroom is needed. * We get promoted in our business or occupation and our salary increased precisely as we are able to convince our superiors in the hierarchy of our merits with reference to their requirements. The exception to this is of course if we are members of a trade union, in which case, as things are today, our salaries are increased, not according to our merit, but according to the seriousness of the threats with which we are able to menace our employers. There have been attempts by students in some schools to follow this example by threatening the school authorities in various ways if they do not give them what they want. This could not happen at Aiglon for the very simple reason that we would rather close the school than abandon our principles. * Education includes developing appreciation for and a relationship with our environment. Intimate contact with nature, too, is important, and a realization of our living relationship with it. Hence our adventure training program. * Learning to live with others and maintaining good relations with people is part of an education. Absolutely essential too is a positive and loving relationship with all other people regardless of their origin, background or beliefs, and a positive and loving relationship with everything in the world and in the universe around us. * The education which we offer is designed to go far beyond [passing your exams or getting a better job. It aims] to develop the whole of you and not just a part, to help you to become truly and intensely alive, to help you to a knowledge of and understanding of that part of you which I call the spiritual part, by attention whose dictates you can attain to much more than success in examinations and a good job, that is to lasting happiness. Note: This theory of education goes further than a typical school’s mission.

Hahn maintained that it was crucial for students to prepare for life by having them confront it, to develop courage, generosity, imagination, principle and resolution. He felt that this would result in young people becoming better equipped, developing the skills and abilities to become the leaders and guardians of the future.http://www.roundsquare.org Aiglon College became a member school of the Round Square association in 19xx, and followed these same precepts, giving the school an additional respect and regard in the educational community. The Round Square web site notes that, \\"Unlike all the other twentieth century educational innovators, Hahn wrote no books. His testimony and legacy rest in his schools and other programmes he initiated.\\" Like Kurt Hahn, John Corlette left behind a school that he had started. A tribute to Corlette: \\"John Corlette of Aiglon...was our most powerful personality and he was the only one to own his own school. He was urging expansion and development long before I felt we were ready for it. He insisted that there must be an association journal but it was not until 1982 that the enthusiasm and driving energy of Margaret Sittler got “Echo” going. John was an original and this showed itself in his creation Aiglon and its most characteristic custom: the morning Meditation. He collected art and had a weakness for Jaguars (petrol driven). He was a master of publicity and used this much to the benefit of his school. During the first American conference at Athenian in 1972, Aiglon gave a reception in San Francisco and a very fine film of the school was shown with a commentary by the best of the BBC announcers. It began with the camera swinging through the arc of mountains between Aiguille Verte and the Dent du Midi. Then it swept down into the Rhone valley and one saw the distant road zigzagging up towards Villars. A small object driving up the road grew into a familiar streamline shape and the voice of the BBC chimed in: “John Corlette had a dream”. There was a chortle of joy from the assembled Heads, which John took in good part.\\" The above is an extract from The Muscles of Friendship – a valedictory speech by Jocelin Winthrop Young, Founding Director of Round Square, on the occasion of his retirement, October 1992 (made at Bishop's College School, Lennoxville, Quebec, Canada).

Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of fungal meningitis are generally similar to those of other types of meningitis, and include: a fever, stiff neck, severe headache, photophobia (sensitivity to light), nausea and vomiting, and altered mental status (drowsiness or confusion).  Causes  Fungal meningitis may be caused by the following (and also other) types of fungi: * Candida - C. albicans is the most common Candida species that causes infections of the central nervous system. * Coccidioides - it is endemic to southwestern United States and Mexico. A third of patients presenting with disseminated coccidioidomycosis have developed meningitis. * Histoplasma - occurs in bird and bat droppings and is endemic to parts of the United States, South, and Central America. Involvement of the central nervous system occurs in about 10-20% of cases of disseminated histoplasmosis. * Blastomyces - occurs in soil rich in decaying organic matter in the Midwest United States. Meningitis is an unusual manifestation of blastomycosis and can be very difficult to diagnose. * Cryptococcus (Cryptococcal meningitis) - it is thought to be acquired through inhalation of soil contaminated with bird droppings. C. neoformans is the most common pathogen to cause fungal meningitis. * Aspergillus - Aspergillus infections account for 5% of fungal infections involving the central nervous system. =Risk factors= Individuals with a weak immune system are most at risk. This includes individuals taking immunosuppressive medication, cancer patients, HIV patients, premature babies with very low birth weight, the elderly, etc. People who are at an increased risk of acquiring particular fungal infections in general may also be at an increased risk of developing fungal meningitis, as the infection may in some cases spread to the central nervous system. People residing in the Midwestern United States, and Southwestern United States and Mexico are at an increased risk of infection with Histoplasma and Coccidioides, respectively. Diagnosis If suspected, fungal meningitis is diagnosed by testing blood and cerebrospinal fluid for pathogens. Identifying the specific pathogen is necessary to determine the proper course of treatment and the prognosis. Measurement of opening pressure, cell count with differential, glucose and protein concentrations, Gram's stain, India ink, and culture tests should be performed on cerebrospinal fluid when fungal meningitis is suspected. Treatment Fungal meningitis is treated with long courses of high dose antifungal medications. The duration of treatment is dependent upon the causal pathogen and the patient's ability to stave off the infection; for patients with a weaker immune system or diabetes, treatment will often take longer.  Prognosis  Prognosis depends on the pathogen responsible for the infection and risk group. Overall mortality for Candida meningitis is 10-20%, 31% for patients with HIV, and 11% in neurosurgical cases (when treated). Prognosis for Aspergillus and coccidioidal infections is poor. Outbreaks E. Rostratum As of November 5, 2012, the CDC reported that 409 patients had laboratory-confirmed fungal meningitis caused by injections with contaminated medication. There had been 30 fatalities. A black mold, Exserohilum rostratum, was found in 45 of these cases. Aspergillus fumigatus was found in one case, and a Cladosporium species was found in one case. Aspergillus has been very rarely associated with meningitis while cases caused explicitly by Exserohilum in otherwise healthy individuals have not been previously reported.

The town was founded by Plummer Ijams, a descendant of Welsh immigrants, from whom the town took its name. The discovery of high-quality slate in the area led to Ijamsville's brief era as a mining town, which lasted until its transition to agriculture in the mid-1800s. In the mid-to-late 20th century, large quantities of land in Ijamsville were purchased by developers, and the town became primarily residential as a suburb of Frederick, Baltimore, and D.C.. HistoryFounding and name= In 1785, a Maryland native named Plummer Ijams moved to Frederick County, having purchased a tract of land called the \\"Paradise Grant\\" from the government. His family was originally from Wales and emigrated to the Anne Arundel region sometime during the 17th century. The land was approximately southeast of the city of Frederick and cost Plummer one pound, fifteen shillings, and four pence per acre. Plummer established a plantation on his new land, growing primarily wheat and barley, with a small number of slaves. Plummer had at least two children: a son named Plummer II and a younger child named John (born in 1789). Plummer Jr. built a gristmill along nearby Bush Creek (which stood until demolished in 1994) while John enlisted in the War of 1812 and rose to the rank of captain. Plummer Ijams Sr. died on June 14, 1796, but his children and their family remained in the area well into the 19th century. The railroad tracks which run through Ijamsville In the 1780s and '90s, other settlers (including the Musetter, Montgomery, and Riggs families) established themselves nearby, purchasing land either from the government or directly from the Ijams family. One of the most important were the three brothers John, William, and Thomas Duvall, whose tract of land became known as \\"Duvall's Forest.\\" The Duvalls discovered large deposits of slate in 1800, and two quarries were operational by 1812, at least one owned by a man named Gideon Bantz. Veins of this unique blue-green or purple volcanic \\"Ijamsville phylite\\" \\"lie west and southwest of Westminster and extend southwest from Frederick County into Montgomery County\\" and are largely responsible for the community's early growth. Around 1831, the early B&O; Railroad asked the Ijams family for permission to construct railroad tracks through its land. Plummer II accepted on the condition that a depot also be built, in part to ease the transport of slate into the local cities. The B&O; christened the heretofore unnamed community \\"Ijams' Mill and Bantzs' Slate Quarries.\\" On March 13, 1832, four horse-drawn railroad cars traveled through the town on their inaugural journey from Baltimore to Frederick. In 1786, the Ijams family requested that a post office be constructed on their land. This marks the first instance where the region was considered a community, before the arrival of the B&O.; The office was finally constructed in 1832, and Plummer II served as its first postmaster. On June 22, 1832, the U.S. Postal Service shortened the town's name to \\"Ijamsville.\\" =Expansion= Over the next few decades, the town expanded steadily into a \\"typically colorful mining town\\". An influx of Welsh immigrants who came to work the slate mines (now equipped with steam-powered processing equipment) led to the establishment of a residential section north of the railroad tracks. Most of the homes in this section had slate roofing from the Duvall slate quarry and wooden walls from Duvall's Forest. In fact, Ijamsville slate was used as roofing material throughout Frederick and even in Washington, D.C.. Many small shops grew up towards the center of the town, catering to the needs of residents. The most notable of these, A. K. Williams's General Store, housed the post office and B&O; ticketing office. The building itself stood for over one hundred years before being finally demolished in 2015. In May 1887, Ijamsville's Women's Home Missionary Society established a \\"Young People's Circle\\" which drew teenagers and young adults from the countryside into town. By that time, the town could boast a coppershop, carpenter's shop, wheelwright, stable, boardinghouse, shoemaker, milliner, and the gristmill and a sawmill constructed by the original Ijams residents (sold in 1874 to the McComas family for around $6,900). The Ijamsville church as it looks today Resident Chris M. Riggs began a fundraising campaign in 1854 to construct a church in Ijamsville. Local Episcopalians donated a land lot to the cause, farmer Charles Hendry fired the bricks, and the women of the town made and sold quilts to raise the needed funds. The roof was made of Ijamsville phyllite. On July 25, 1858, Ijamsville's Methodist Episcopal Church was officially dedicated and received its first two ministers—Reverends Thomas B. Sergeant and T. M. Reese—who happened to be Lutheran. The church building was rebuilt in 1890 after a fire, but is one of the few original town buildings still standing today. The church's basement served as the local school until 1876, when a building adjacent to the church was constructed to house the few students. Professor Chasuble McGill Luckett was the school's first teacher, with other teachers (including some women form the Riggs family) riding in on horseback to help when needed. The school reportedly took $509.98 to operate each year. Local farms continued to produce wheat, barley, corn, tobacco, and sheep. The town's flour and slate were well recognized in Baltimore and Frederick, two of the most important stops on the local railroad. Ijamsville nearly even developed a small pottery industry when potter Artemus Wolf came from Vermont to the town in 1863. He discovered that the soil near the Ijams's spring had the perfect clay content for firing and glazing. With local merchant Benjamin Franklin Sellman, he began selling \\"Wolf and Sellman\\" pottery that sold very well to the nearby towns and farms. Unfortunately for the town, when Wolf journeyed to Vermont in 1876, hoping to form a full- fledged company and return, he caught pneumonia and died. Sellman's store closed down shortly afterward, and no other potters ever came to Ijamsville. =Transition to agriculture= 1898 photograph of a disused quarry in Ijamsville With the onset of the Civil War, the demand for slate dropped off sharply, as did the available workforce. To compound the problem, the B&O; railroad ran an injunction against the local quarry owners for undermining their tracks. These two factors led to the closing many of the town's quarries in 1870. An outside mining company, the Maine Co., attempted to start a mine in Ijamsville but gave up by 1874. Christopher Riggs, a carpenter, then owned and operated the only remaining slate mine, which produced only powdered slate (used as a fertilizer base, a purple dye for paint, or in vitrified bricks). The town shrunk considerably with the end of its mining industry; the 1880 census listed only 71 residents. With the end of mining, Ijamsville transitioned into an agricultural town. At the time, land cost $35–50 an acre. Farmers could produce 15-30 bushels of wheat, 30-50 barrels of corn, ½ ton tobacco, and/or two tons of hay an acre, per season. The local farms changed hands several times, but remained mostly unchanged through the 1940s. The church was run in the late 1800s by a Baptist, progressive leader, and former forty-niner named Isaac T. McComas. Other important residents of the period included a Mrs. Eliza Ijams, who was inspired by her two deaf children (Mary and Plummer III) to become involved with the Maryland School for the Deaf located in nearby Frederick City. Plummer Ijams's granddaughter, Mollie Ijams, was a member of the school's first graduating class. Another local school, the Glenellen Academy, was established in 1874 by Professor Herbert Thompson and his wife Ellen. The school's annual tuition was $100, and specialized in science of all levels. Enrollment peaked at about 40 students, and the school continued to offer lessons even after its official \\"closure\\" in 1888. An interesting local legend held that Mrs. Thompson was the ghostwriter of the romance novel Lorna Doone while she lived in England. Though Lady Ellen and some of the couple's students often claimed that she was the book's true author and requested that her relative, R. D. Blackmore, publish it under his name, no definitive proof was ever given for their story. The Westport Paving Brick Company of Baltimore reopened one of the slate quarries from 1913-1937; company records from 1922 show 120 tons of slate and shale being shipped daily. After about 1925, the easy availability of automobiles led to the death of the railroad. The Ijamsville depot was bypassed, though the actual railroad tracks were still open to non-local traffic. As a result, when the Westport Company's operation closed down in 1937, there were no longer any advantages to mining in a small town like Ijamsville, and no quarry has existed in the town since. =Business at the turn of the century= At the turn of the century, only the town's flour mill and creamery were doing well. By 1925, only an antique shop and bakery remained. One of the town's only crimes—the midnight robbery of the Turner family mill by three \\"highwaymen\\"—occurred during that summer, but Ijamsville otherwise remained a \\"quiet country village\\". The center of the town's social life remained the Methodist church and its Homemakers' Club. The church converted the old public school building into a social hall upon its closure in 1932. From that time on, Ijamsville residents were serviced by local Frederick County schools (in particular those of nearby Urbana, Maryland). A large patch of grass sandwiched between a hill and the railroad tracks known as Moxley Field housed Ijamsville champion baseball team. Over the years, the team became \\"almost like a farm team for the Orioles\\" and was one of the town's main attractions, now that the mining industry had been supplanted by agriculture. One business established during late 1800s became Ijamsville's other attraction. The physical building was constructed by Christopher Riggs in 1862 for use by Welsh mining families. Riggs's son, Dr. George Henry Riggs (a local family physician and psychiatrist), converted the structure into a \\"sanatorium for nervous and mental health disorders\\" in 1896. It was in operation until 1969 and treated over a thousand patients from as far away as North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The hospital was called \\"Riggs' Cottage\\" or, more formally, \\"Riggs Cottage Sanitariym for Nervous and Mental Diseases\\". The hospital changed owners at least once during its lifetime, as records show its purchase in 1939 by a Dr. and Mrs. McAdoo. The hospital was originally open to both men and women, but the lack of male nurses during World War I forced the owners to limit it to only female patients. More difficult patients were transferred to a state hospital. An advertisement from the era claimed \\"each patient received individual psychotherapeutic attention, occupation, and recreation... under the most favorable hygienic conditions\\". =Development and suburbanization= Ijamsville remained a quiet agricultural town throughout most of the 20th century. Its few remaining businesses gradually closed down or changed hands: the hospital was converted into an upscale French restaurant (Gabriel's French Provincial Inn), the baseball field was purchased by the Frederick Pony Club, and many of the older structures in town were torn down and not rebuilt. The post office was closed down in 1983 (postal services were then provided out of Monrovia, MD). Without a post office, railroad depot, or other businesses in town, there was nothing to attract new farmers to the area. As the older farmowners died and their children moved closer to city centers, more and more land was put up for sale. By 1989, developers were making purchases of as much as $1 million's worth of land at a time. After the construction of wells and septic fields, the area developed rapidly. Houses were built and filled with families looking for work in nearby Frederick, Baltimore, or Washington, D.C. By 2000, Ijamsville was divided into three areas: the original town center by the railroad tracks, with a few historic homes left intact; several large family farms raising mostly cows, corn, and soybeans; and large sections of suburban-style homes. New companies came into the area to tap the growing upper middle class market in Ijamsville and nearby Urbana. The businesses they established included golf courses and a petting zoo. Two religious centers were established as well: a Roman Catholic, Jesuit Saint Ignatius of Loyola parish (originally from Buckeystown, MD and with another church building in Urbana); and the Hindu Sri Bhaktha Anjaneya Temple, the \\"only [Hindu] temple in the United States dedicated to [Bhaktha]-Anjaneya.\\" The temple was completed in late 2014-early 2015, while the church has stood since the 1980s and undergone several expansions to accommodate new parishioners. A Quaker school named Friends Meeting School (FMS) moved to the area in 1997, sharing space with Pleasant Grove United Methodist Church, also located in Ijamsville. FMS was originally established for preschool through 6th grade, but expanded until it reached its current size in 2013, serving pre-K through 12th grade. As the school expanded, it purchased and moved onto land near Windsor Knolls Middle school. The Christian Life Center, a United Pentecostal organization from Rockville, MD, purchased land near FMS in early 2012 and began holding services in Damascus High School. The organization moved into their newly constructed building in August 2013. Education Frederick County Public Schools operates area schools. Schools with Ijamsville postal addresses include Oakdale Elementary School, Oakdale Middle School, Urbana Middle School, Windsor Knolls Middle School, Oakdale High School, and Urbana High School.\\"Schools Directory.\\" Frederick County Public Schools.

It was built as part of an urban renewal program prior to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Before this, it was a run-down area of empty warehouses, railroad yards, and factories. 16 million people visit the complex each year. It is now a focal point of the city and tourist attraction, containing the Maremàgnum (a mall containing shops, a multiplex cinema, bars and restaurants), IMAX Port Vell and Europe's largest aquarium containing 8000 Fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 6 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of sea water. A pedestrian walkway, Rambla de Mar, connects La Rambla to Port Vell. It incorporates a swing bridge, in order to allow ships to enter and exit the harbour. HistoryAncient history= Around the 4th century BC Barcelona was occupied by the Laietani. A tribe of Iberian people who inhabited the coastline between the Llobregat and Tordera rivers. Barkeno, on Montjuïc, was their main settlement. These people traded with the Greek colony in Empúries, building large grain stores for the purpose. In the 1st century AD, the Romans founded a colony, Barcino, on Mount Tàber. The first port activity on the northern side of Montjuïc. The city and its maritime activities began to truly flourish and expand when Barcino's city walls were built after the Barbarian invasion in 263. =Middle ages and modern age= During the Late Middle Ages, Barcelona found itself on the frontier between Islam to the south and Christianity to the north. This strategic location was decisive in Barcelona's growth, for the city became established as a trading point between the two worlds and, eventually, the greatest maritime power in the Mediterranean, despite not possessing a port worthy of the name. The ships that anchored between the Royal Shipyards and the city were badly exposed to the great storms that often affected this coast and which caused many shipwrecks. These storms made it extremely difficult to build an artificial harbour, because the huge amounts of sand and sediment deposited as a result of these phenomena damaged any work, whether ongoing or complete. Work on the first successful project began in 1477. The enterprise entailed building a dock that would stretch as far as Maians Island, a sandy islet about 100 metres off the coast. As the dike that sheltered the harbour was extended in various stages to the south and southwest of Maians Island, sand was also deposited in large quantities on the beach to the southeast of the Ciutadella. The Barceloneta neighbourhood was built on this new peninsula. Despite the constant work to extend the dike (which reached what is now the Moll de Pescadors in 1723), in 1743 the huge amounts of sand that had accumulated finally collapsed the port. An enormous sandbank between the dike's end and what is now Plaça del Portal de la Pau made it necessary to close the port, trapping some of the anchored ships. The beacon in the Moll de Pescadors dock, was built a little later, in 1772. In order to provide a definitive solution to the problem of harbor depth, work began in 1816 to extend the breakwater, which reached what is now the floating dike in 1882. However, a newly formed sandbank showed that even this was not sufficient, and the dike was enlarged once more, whilst an outer harbour wall was also built and the port mouth was moved to what is now the West Dock, or Moll de Ponent. In 1868, the Barcelona authorities requested permission from the Development Ministry to constitute the Port of Barcelona Board of Public Works (Junta d'obres), which met for the first time in 1869. This institution continued to operate until 1978. It was under the Board of Public Works that the port's structure was at last consolidated and the danger from sand and storms finally overcome. Construction of the first \\"transversal\\" dock, where the Moll de Barcelona (Barcelona Dock) now stands, was completed in 1882. This dock later housed Torre Jaume I, the cable car tower for the Port Vell Aerial Tramway, built across the harbor for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, a World's fair, but opened only in 1931. The Port continued to grow, stretching past Mount Montjuïc towards the Llobregat Delta with the construction of an inner harbour on the river bank, precisely where Barcelona's first port activity had its origins. =Recent times= The port's Statute of Autonomy was approved in 1978, when the site took on the official title of Autonomous Port of Barcelona, and in 1987 work began on drafting the Strategic Plan, an ambitious project to develop the whole port. Offices of public works were dissolved in 1992, and port authorities were established to replace them. Under the Strategic Plan, the port is structured around three main areas: the commercial port, the logistical port and the old port. The plan pays particular attention to the last of these, the Port Vell, with a view to reviving a historic old site made obsolete by large-scale extension work in recent decades and relegated to serving traditional purposes. Nowadays, the Port Vell is fully integrated into the city. Other ports in Barcelona *Port Olímpic *Royal Barcelona Yacht Club Transport *Barcelona Metro station Drassanes, on L3.

The name was acquired and used by a new business from 2008.Sarolea Motorcycles Heritage/Brand legacy. Retrieved 6 January 2020  Manufacturing to 1963  Saroléa was the first Belgian producer of motorcycles, and one of the first producers of motorcycles in the world. This Belgian factory was established in 1850 as a weapons factory by Joseph Saroléa. In 1892 bicycle production started. Joseph died in 1894 and under the management of his sons the company grew larger. In the 1920s, the firm became successfully involved with long distance runs, reliability trials and hill climbs. From 1927 on, the company made its own gearboxes and early in 1929 the factory was extended to some 6000m2. Nearly all components of the bikes were made in-house now and the production capacity grew to 50 machines per day. Later in 1929 a brand new state-of the-art production facility was commissioned which brought the production capacity to 75 machines per day. In the early years of the century Saroléas were sold in Britain under the Kerry brand. Both singles and V twins were made and the firm supplied engines to a number of firms in several countries. In turn, Saroléa used a number of British components such as Sturmey-Archer gearboxes and AMAL carburettors. Saroléa was ready for the new decade, but the new decade also brought an economic crisis. This forced the company to expand the range of machines with cheaper models. The first of the light two strokes was brought out in 1932. It had a unit construction engine of Saroléa's own design. The front forks are of pressed steel construction and the ignition is taken care of by battery and coil. Bosch electrics are employed. During World War II the factory was shut down by the Nazis, and very few bikes were produced during the occupation of Belgium. In 1952, Belgian rider, Victor Leloup, rode a Saroléa to victory in the inaugural F.I.M. European Motocross Championship. In 1955 Saroléa started a joint venture together with FN (motorcycle) and Gillet Herstal. This lasted until 1960, when Saroléa was merged into Gillet. Saroléa ceased to exist in 1963. Sarolea used a Sachs 200 engine at some time (probably some time after World War 2.

Biography  Vizing was born in Kiev on March 25, 1937. His mother was half- German,\\"Vizing\\" may be the romanization of the phonetic transcription of the German surname Wiesing into Russian. and because of this the Soviet authorities forced his family to move to Siberia in 1947. After completing his undergraduate studies in mathematics in Tomsk State University in 1959, he began his Ph.D. studies at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Moscow, on the subject of function approximation, but he left in 1962 without completing his degree. Instead, he returned to Novosibirsk, working from 1962 to 1968 at the Russian Academy of Sciences there and earning a Ph.D. in 1966. In Novosibirsk, he was a regular participant in A. A. Zykov's seminar in graph theory. After holding various additional positions, he moved to Odessa in 1974, where he taught mathematics for many years at the Academy for Food Technology (originally known as Одесский технологический институт пищевой промышленности им. М. В. Ломоносова, \\"Odessa Technological Institute of Food Industry named after Mikhail Lomonosov\\").  Research results  The result now known as Vizing's theorem, published in 1964 when Vizing was working in Novosibirsk, states that the edges of any graph with at most Δ edges per vertex can be colored using at most Δ + 1 colors. It is a continuation of the work of Claude Shannon, who showed that any multigraph can have its edges colored with at most (3/2)Δ colors (a tight bound, as a triangle with Δ/2 edges per side requires this many colors).In both and , Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by Shannon's theorem. For the triangle lower bound example, see e.g. Colorful Mathematics. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, Diskret. Analiz.The full name of this journal was Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny˘ı Analiz. Sbornik Trudov. It was renamed Metody Diskretnogo Analiza in 1980 (the name given for it in ) and discontinued in 1991 . Vizing also made other contributions to graph theory and graph coloring, including the introduction of list coloring, the formulation of the total coloring conjecture (still unsolved) stating that the edges and vertices of any graph can together be colored with at most Δ + 2 colors,In , Vizing states that he formulated the conjecture in 1964, but by the time it was published in 1968 Behzad had independently posed the same conjecture. Vizing's conjecture (also unsolved) concerning the domination number of cartesian products of graphs, and the 1974 definition of the modular product of graphs as a way of reducing subgraph isomorphism problems to finding maximum cliques in graphs. He also proved a stronger version of Brook's theorem that applies to list coloring. From 1976, Vizing stopped working on graph theory and studied problems of scheduling instead, only returning to graph theory again in 1995.

Situated in the upper Middletown Valley, the village developed as a regional center of commerce and industry in the mid-nineteenth century. The rural character of the community remains well preserved in its culture and architecture today. History Beginning in the second quarter of the 18th century, European settlers, mainly Germans and Swiss, began to populate the northern Middletown Valley. Their first permanent settlement was called Jerusalem, located west of the present-day town of Myersville. As settlers began to spread out in the valley, taking advantage of plentiful timber sources and fertile farm land, crossroad villages began to develop, including Wolfsville, named for the Wolf Family who were living within the present village by the 1830s. In 1848, the population had grown to an extant that the General Assembly established a new election district called Catoctin with Wolfsville at its center. That same year, Wolfsville was affixed as a stop for the stage lines carrying U.S. mail throughout Frederick County. In 1851, a local effort was launched to create a new county from several districts in north-western Frederick and north-eastern Washington Counties, but the Catoctin District voted unanimously against the proposal. Wolfsville in 1873Wolfsville continued to grow as a commercial center for area farmers. By 1858, the village was served by two general stores, a tannery, and a blacksmith shop. Two decades later, the village had expanded with a total of three general stores, two blacksmith shops, and a post office. Many of these buildings, designed to serve both as commercial spaces and dwellings, remain well-preserved in Wolfsville today. By the turn of the twentieth century, the construction of the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway bypassed Wolfsville several miles to the south, bringing growth to the town of Myersville. Today, Wolfsville retains much of its historic fabric with a high degree of integrity. Architectural styles range from early vernacular expressions of Greek Revival or Federal styles to late Victorian era examples of Queen Anne and Gothic Revival styles. Several buildings display their original dual use as dwellings and commercial spaces. One general store remains in operation today at the crossroads in the heart of Wolfsville, operated by the Harne Family since 1945. The Hoover Farm, situated on the southeastern edge of the village, preserves an early 19th-century stone dwelling and barn, site of early religious meetings which later formalized into Wolfsville's churches. In the mid-19th century, Wolfsville had three churches: Lutheran, German Reformed, and United Brethren. Two of these congregations remain active today: St. Mark's Lutheran Church and Salem United Brethren Church, both built in 1847 out of native stone, but significantly altered since. Furniture Production A sewing rocking chair made by Christopher Columbus Stottlemyer, displaying the characteristic scalloped back slats. A sewing rocking chair made by Kelsey Alvey Gaver in Ellerton, Maryland, closely resembling the Stottlemyer style. For eighty years, Wolfsville was a regional center of chair making, primary through the business operated by the Stottlemyer Family. In the decade prior to the American Civil War, Frederick Stottlemyer (1830-1913) established a shop and began turning Shaker-styled ladderback straight and rocking chairs. Frederick's son, Christopher Columbus Stottlemyer (1857-1931) apprenticed with his father and gradually assumed the management of the family's business, modernizing the production through the introduction of a steam powered lathe and sawmill, increasing the shop's output in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Christopher Stottlemyer also developed many of the characteristic components for which Stottlemyer Chairs came to be recognized, including scalloped back slats and turned acorn-shaped finials on the back posts of the chairs. Stottlemyer chairs were mostly produced in three forms: straight chairs, sewing or nursing rockers (a rocking chair without arms), and armed rocking chairs. The shop also produced other furniture, including tables and cradles. Following the death of Christopher Stottlemyer in 1931, the family business was purchased by Kelsey Alvey Gaver of nearby Ellerton who moved production to his family's farm along Catoctin Creek and began producing his own chairs, bearing strong resemblance to those made by his predecessors. Gaver was only in production for a decade before he was killed in action serving in the Pacific during World War II in June 1943. Other furniture production in the Wolfsville area was carried on by the Marken and Gladhill families in the early and mid-nineteenth century.

MAS stood, in the context, for \\"Alberico Seiling Motorcycles\\" (Motocicli Alberico Seiling). Seiling was an Italian constructor who developed a variety of motorbikes between 1920 and 1922, and in 1922 started commercial production. His 173 cc overhead valve (OHV) model with an external flywheel proved particularly popular. He also produced a single-cylinder 498 cc OHV model, and from 1928 a twin-cylinder model, also with 498 cc of displacement. In 1937 an OLHV model with a special cylinder head appeared, with a vertically mounted camshaft, the cylinder valves set horizontally in a separate chamber above the combustion chamber. The combustion mixture was premixed in this separate chamber. By excluding the valves from the combustion chamber itself it was possible to use a 15:1 compression ratio which was by the standards of the time very high. The motor was not a success, however. Seiling sold the MAS business to the Guidetti brothers in 1938. After this he continued to produce motor cycles in his own name (Seiling: A. Scoppio S.A.) and then, in 1939, he obtained finance to establish a new motorcycle manufacturing business under the name Altea. Altea produced a single-cylinder ohv 198 cc machine. However, this business ended in 1941 due to the general war which had by then broken out across most of Europe.

It ended in British victory and is also known as 'Træskoslaget' or 'the Clogs Battle', since many of the Danish militiamen threw their heavy wooden clogs away when they were fleeing. Background The British government feared the Danish fleet was about to fall into French hands and thus delivered Denmark-Norway an ultimatum to sail its fleet to Britain or face war with Britain. The Danish government refused so British troops landed at Vedbæk on 16 August and began an investment on Copenhagen. Joachim Castenschiold was ordered to create a frikorps and lift the investment. Castenschiold's forces concentrated themselves around Roskilde and Lejre, while general Oxholm was sent south to activate the Søndre Sjællandske Landeværnsregiment. Castenschiold arrived at Køge on 26 August and two days later he was joined by Oxholm and his force. This gave Castenschiold a grand total of around 7,000 militiamen, 600 cavalry and 13 cannon. In the meantime the British headquarters at Copenhagen had gained had become aware of the Danish militia's mobilisation and on 27 August general Arthur Wellesley (later 1st Duke of Wellington) was ordered to locate and defeat it. Battle Wellesley's 6,000-man Anglo-German infantry force included the 1st Battalion of the 43rd Foot, the 2nd Battalion of the 52nd Foot, the 1st Battalion of the 92nd Foot, five companies from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 95th Foot, and the 6th Line Battalion King's German Legion. Three squadrons each of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd King's German Legion Hussar Regiments totaled 1,620 cavalrymen. The eight 6-pound cannons and two 5.5-inch howitzers were served by Newhouse's battery of the Royal Horse Artillery and Sympher's half-battery of the King's German Legion. Colonel Wilhelm von Linsingen was Wellesley's brigade commander.Smith (1998), p. 254. Castenschiold's force was made up of 7,000 infantry in 11 battalions, 150 cavalry in two squadrons, and 120 artillerists serving nine guns. The foot soldiers were organized into the 5th, 6th and 7th Battalions of the North Zealand Landværn, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Battalions of the South Zealand Landværn. There were 70 horsemen from the Zealand Cavalry Regiment and 80 mounted troops from the Landværn Cavalry. Aftermath In the period from 16 to 31 August, Anglo-German losses numbered 29 killed, 122 wounded, and 21 missing. The Danes lost two officers killed and four wounded, while their rank and file suffered 150 killed and 200 wounded. Their greatest loss was in prisoners. The Allies captured over 1,700 men, including Oxholm, nine majors, 19 captains, and 28 lieutenants. Anglo-German trophies included all nine artillery pieces, one color, and 68 wagons.

The inventory control problem is the problem faced by a firm that must decide how much to order in each time period to meet demand for its products. The problem can be modeled using mathematical techniques of optimal control, dynamic programming and network optimization. The study of such models is part of inventory theory. Issues One issue is infrequent large orders vs. frequent small orders. Large orders will increase the amount of inventory on hand, which is costly, but may benefit from volume discounts. Frequent orders are costly to process, and the resulting small inventory levels may increase the probability of stockouts, leading to loss of customers. In principle all these factors can be calculated mathematically and the optimum found. A second issue is related to changes in demand (predictable or random) for the product. For example, having the needed merchandise on hand in order to make sales during the appropriate buying season(s). A classic example is a toy store before Christmas: if the items are not on the shelves, they cannot be sold. And the wholesale market is not perfect' there can be considerable delays, particularly with the most popular toys. So, the entrepreneur or business manager will buy speculatively. Another example is a furniture store. If there is a six-week, or more, delay for customers to receive merchandise, some sales will be lost. A further example is a restaurant, where a considerable percentage of the sales are the value-added aspects of food preparation and presentation, and so it is rational to buy and store somewhat more to reduce the chances of running out of key ingredients. The situation often comes down to two key questions: confidence in the merchandise selling, and the benefits accruing if it does? A third issue comes from the view that inventory also serves the function of decoupling two separate operations. For example, work in process inventory often accumulates between two departments because the consuming and the producing department do not coordinate their work. With improved coordination this buffer inventory could be eliminated. This leads to the whole philosophy of Just In Time, which argues that the costs of carrying inventory have typically been underestimated, both the direct, obvious costs of storage space and insurance, but also the harder-to-measure costs of increased variables and complexity, and thus decreased flexibility, for the business enterprise. Inventory models The mathematical approach is typically formulated as follows: a store has, at time k, x_k items in stock. It then orders (and receives) u_k items, and sells w_k items, where w follows a given probability distribution. Thus: : x_{k+1} = x_k + u_k - w_k : u_k \\\\ge 0 Whether x_k is allowed to go negative, corresponding to back-ordered items, will depend on the specific situation; if allowed there will usually be a penalty for back orders. The store has costs that are related to the number of items in store and the number of items ordered: :c_k = c(x_k, u_k). Often this will be in additive form: c_k = p(x_k) + h(u_k) The store wants to select u_k in an optimal way, i.e. to minimize : \\\\sum_{k=0}^T c_k. Many other features can be added to the model, including multiple products (denoted x_{ik}), upper bounds on inventory and so on. Inventory models can be based on different assumptions:Zipkin Paul H., Foundations of Inventory Management, Boston: McGraw Hill, 2000, W. Hopp, M. Spearman, Factory Physics, 3rd ed.

She was originally named Society Adventurer, but after Discoverer Reederei was unable to take delivery of the vessel due to financial troubles, the completed ship was laid up at the shipyard for almost two years. In 1993, she was acquired by Hanseatic Tours (which later merged with Hapag-Lloyd) and renamed Hanseatic. In 2018, she was chartered to One Ocean Expeditions and given her current name.  General characteristics  RCGS Resolute is long overall and between perpendiculars, has a beam of and draws of water with a displacement of . Her gross tonnage is 8,445; net tonnage 2,573; and deadweight tonnage 1,177 tonnes. The ship's hull and propulsion system are strengthened for navigation in ice-covered waters according to the DNV GL ice class E4, which is equivalent to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class for merchant ships, 1A Super. Built to cater to the five-star luxury cruise market, interiors on the RCGS Resolutes six passenger- accessible decks were designed by the German architect Wilfried Köhnemann. The vessel has 88 outside cabins and, above the bridge deck, four suites for a total of 184 passengers served by a crew of 125. Public spaces include a restaurant, multiple lounges, and a 78-seat theater. The ship carries 14 Zodiac inflatable boats to take passengers ashore during expedition cruises. The ship's propulsion system consists of two eight-cylinder MaK 8M453C four- stroke medium-speed diesel engines, each rated at 600rpm, driving two controllable pitch propellers. Onboard electrical power is generated by two six-cylinder MaK 6M332 auxiliary diesel generators and two main engine driven shaft generators. For maneuvering in ports, the ship has a transverse bow thruster. RCGS Resolute has a service speed of and a cruising range of .  Career  Society Adventurer = In December 1989, the German cruise ship company Discoverer Reederei decided to order a $75 million expedition cruise ship for its US-based subsidiary Society Expeditions. The shipbuilding contract was awarded to Rauma Yards, a new Finnish company established in August of the same year following the disbanding of Rauma-Repola's shipyard group. The ship, launched on 5 January 1991 as Society Adventurer, was intended for adventure-style cruises to remote destinations such as Antarctica and had, among other features, an ice-strengthened hull. However, Discoverer Reederei was unable to take delivery of the vessel in the following summer due to financial troubles and also had to cancel a sister ship that had already been contracted. As a result, the ownership of the vessel was transferred to Rauma Yards's newly-established Bahamas-registered subsidiary, Society Adventurer Shipping Company, on 7 June 1991. Later that year, Rauma Yards was merged with another local shipbuilder, Hollming, as Finnyards. While on a lay- up at the yard, Society Adventurer was inspected by a number of parties interested in acquiring the vessel, among them the future president of the United States Donald Trump who visited Rauma in 1992. = Hanseatic = Hanseatic sporting the classic Hamburg Atlantic Line livery in Nuuk, Greenland, in 2008. In 1993, the ship was chartered and shortly afterwards purchased by the German expedition cruise operator Hanseatic Tours. The company had been established two years earlier by Dirk Moldenhauer, who had been the last captain of German Atlantic Line's cruise ship Hanseatic in 1973 and later acquired rights to the classic Hamburg Atlantic Line logo, livery and the name \\"Hanseatic\\". Society Adventurer was renamed Hanseatic on 23 March 1993, becoming the fourth ship to bear the name, and the original blue-yellow- white Discoverer Reederei livery was replaced with the white hull and red decorative stripes. The vessel's maiden cruise from Hamburg to Sevilla began on 27 March 1993. When Hanseatic Tours was merged with Hapag-Lloyd Cruises in 1997, Hanseatic retained her original name as well as Hamburg Atlantic Line livery and funnel logo until rebranding in 2011. Hanseatic remained in Hapag- Lloyd's fleet until 2018. Over the ship's 25-year career and a total of 667 cruises, she made 128 expeditions to Antarctica, two voyages to the Northern Sea Route (Northeast Passage), and transited the full length of the Northwest Passage 11 times. The latter is a record number for passenger ships, exceeded only by the Russian icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov which is also used for expedition cruises. Hanseatic also holds the record for having been further north among passenger-carrying ships that are not icebreakers: on 26 August 2014, the vessel reached , from the North Pole, due to unusually easy ice conditions in the Russian Arctic at that time. = RCGS Resolute = In June 2017, the Canada-based cruise ship operator One Ocean Expeditions announced that it would expand its fleet of expedition cruise ships with a long-term charter of the former Hanseatic. RCGS Resolute, operated by One Ocean Expeditions, in Errera Channel, Antarctica The ship would be renamed RCGS Resolute after the 1850-built Royal Navy Arctic exploration vessel HMS Resolute as well as the Inuit hamlet Resolute in Nunavut. Furthermore, the ship would carry the initials of the Royal Canadian Geographic Society (RCGS) with whom One Ocean Expeditions had partnered. After concluding her career with Hapag-Lloyd, a brief drydocking in Germany and reflagging from the Bahamas to Portugal, the vessel headed to Canada in October 2018 under her new name and with a new livery. In 2019, the company's financial difficulties began to surface with the sudden withdrawal of the Russian research vessels Akademik Ioffe and Akademik Sergey Vavilov chartered from the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology. Although One Ocean Expeditions initially called the Russian owner's action a contract violation, it was later revealed that the company had failed to pay charter and fueling fees to the intermediate charterer Terragelida Ship Management which had then terminated the contract. This left One Ocean Expeditions with just one ship, RCGS Resolute. In August, she was briefly arrested in Iqaluit over a C$100,000 payment dispute. While this issue was reportedly solved quickly, another arrest over non-payment of services and crew wages followed in Halifax next month. Finally, in October One Ocean Expeditions was forced to cancel an Antarctic cruise midway after the vessel could not be refueled due to the company's non-payment of outstanding debts. Shortly after the ship's 140 passengers disembarked, RCGS Resolute was detained in Buenos Aires over \\"significant debt\\". The company entered administration in January 2020. On 5 March 2020, RCGS Resolute left Buenos Aires after the ship's registered owner, Bunnys Adventure & Cruise Shipping Company Limited, paid a total of US$3.6 million of One Ocean Expeditions's outstanding debt to fuel suppliers, ship agents and crew members in order to avoid a court-ordered sale of the vessel. However, in June 2020 it was reported that RCGS Resolute would be sold in an auction in Curaçao to cover the shipowner's nearly $4 million debt. The ship was reportedly sold for $600,000 on 22 June 2020.  Incidents  1996 grounding = On 29 August 1996, Hanseatic ran aground in Simpson Strait in the Canadian Arctic. The vessel was eleven days into an eastbound transit along the Northwest Passage with 149 passengers and 110 crew, and had stopped at Gjoa Haven to let passengers ashore. Unknowingly to the crew, a green buoy marking a shallow shoal had not been removed after the previous navigating season and, over the winter months, had been moved to the northeast by about by drifting ice. Shortly after departure, Hanseatic ran aground on the shoal at . With no danger of the vessel sinking, Hanseatics passengers were allowed to explore the nearby islands using the ship's boats until the Russian icebreaker Kapitan Dranitsyn arrived to pick up the passengers on 5 September and continue the Northwest Passage expedition under charter by Hanseatic Tours. Hanseatic itself was successfully refloated on 8 September. While the ship's hull was damaged during the grounding, no oil spilled to the sea and there were no injuries among the passengers or the crew. = 1997 grounding = On 14 July 1997, Hanseatic was grounded on a sand bank in Murchisonfjorden in Svalbard with 145 passengers on board. No injuries nor damage to the ship was reported, and the passengers were again taken to explore nearby islands on Hanseatics Zodiac boats while awaiting evacuation. By 17 July, the ship had been refloated and was heading towards Longyearbyen for inspection. = 2005 grounding = In August 2005, Hanseatic ran aground near the island of Lurøya on the Norwegian coast, just south of the Arctic Circle, with 160 passengers on board. While the vessel was not in danger of sinking despite a hole in one of her ballast water tank, the passengers and part of the crew was nonetheless evacuated. = 2013 drydock fire = On 13 June 2013, a fire broke out in Hanseatics engine room due to hot work in one of the ballast water tanks while the ship was in a drydock at the Bredo Shipyard in Bremerhaven. Due to delays in drydocking and additional repairs required by the fire, four cruises between 17 June and 1 August had to be cancelled. = 2020 collision with Venezuelan patrol boat Naiguatá = Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat (GC-23), which sank in March 2020 following a collision with RCGS Resolute, seen during sea trials in an undated photograph. On 30 March 2020, RCGS Resolute was involved in an incident off the Venezuelan coast which led to the sinking of the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat (GC-23) following a collision with the cruise ship.  Initial reports  In a statement released by Venezuela on 31 March, RCGS Resolute was accused of committing an act of \\"aggression and piracy\\" by intentionally ramming and sinking Naiguatá while the patrol boat was conducting a maritime traffic control operation, as well as of acting \\"cowardly and criminal\\" for not participating in the search and rescue of the patrol boat's crew of 44, all of which were rescued by other Venezuelan vessels. An illustration of the incident released by the Venezuelan Navy describes RCGS Resolute turning hard starboard to ram Naiguatá while the patrol boat was sailing alongside the cruise ship. Video footage later released by the Venezuelan Navy first show a Naiguatá crewman firing warning shots with an AK-47 assault rifle, followed by the patrol boat taking water after colliding with the RCGS Resolutes visibly damaged bow. In addition, Venezuela has also alleged that Portuguese-flagged RCGS Resolute was carrying mercenaries for attacking the country's military bases and that the ship's inflatable Zodiac boats were intended to transport them to shore. According to a statement released on 1 April by Columbia Cruise Services, the company responsible for technical management of RCGS Resolute, the cruise ship was approached by Naiguatá in international waters, about from La Tortuga Island, Venezuela, shortly after midnight. RCGS Resolute, which had left Buenos Aires on 5 March, had been adrift in the open sea for a day while carrying out routine maintenance on the starboard main engine before reaching her next destination, Willemstad in Curaçao. After having questioned her intentions over radio, the Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel ordered RCGS Resolute to follow her to Puerto Moreno on the eastern side of Margarita Island. While the master was in contact with the company's head office and designated person ashore (DPA), warning shots were fired from Naiguatá and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow. During an apparent attempt to change the heading of RCGS Resolute towards Venezuelan territorial waters, Naiguatá came in contact with the cruise ship's ice-strengthened bulbous bow, started to take water, and eventually sank. RCGS Resolute, which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) Curaçao.  Portuguese investigation  On 6 April, the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority ( or GAMA) of Portugal released a technical investigation report on the incident involving the Portuguese-flagged cruise ship. According to the report, RCGS Resolute had departed Buenos Aires on 5 March and sailed to the Caribbean Sea along the South American coastline. On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, RCGS Resolute had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine turbocharger was being serviced. On the night of 30 March, RCGS Resolute was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat Naiguatá at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF Marine band radio, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), RCGS Resolute announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Curaçao. At around 01:05 local time, Naiguatá approached RCGS Resolute from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship. A few minutes later, RCGS Resolutes master ordered the port side controllable pitch propeller first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, Naiguatás AIS-SART was activated but RCGS Resolute was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over the radio and instead contacted JRCC Curaçao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing liferafts for launching. At 02:43, JRCC Curaçao relayed a statement from the Venezuelan authority responsible for the region, MRCC La Guairaa, that RCGS Resolutes assistance was no longer needed on site and instructed the cruise ship to proceed to Willemstad in order to avoid problems with the Venezuelan Navy. Although the Portuguese authorities have not obtained statements from Venezuela, the report discusses the possibility that the unexpected change in Naiguatás heading just before the collision, as reported by RCGS Resolute, may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of Naiguatá was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.

He is known for his work in designing the Fairchild Channel F video game console as well as leading the team that pioneered the commercial video game cartridge.\\"The Untold Story Of The Invention Of The Game Cartridge\\". FastCompany. He has been dubbed by some as the \\"Father of Modern Gaming\\". Early life Lawson was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on December 1, 1940. His father Blanton was a longshoreman with an interest in science, while his mother Mannings worked for the city, and also served on the PTA for the local school and made sure that he received a good education. He had a grandfather that was educated as a physicist but was never able to achieve a career in physics, instead working as a postmaster. Both of his parents encouraged his interests in scientific hobbies, including ham radio and chemistry. Lawson said that his first-grade teacher helped encourage him on his path to be someone influential similar to George Washington Carver. While in high school, he earned money by repairing television sets. At the age of 13, he earned an amateur ham radio license. After receiving this license, he would save his money to buy parts from local electronic stores to build his own station in his room. He attended both Queens College and City College of New York, but did not complete a degree at either. Career The Fairchild Channel F, with the cartridge slot on the right of the unit In 1970, he joined Fairchild Semiconductor in San Francisco as an applications engineering consultant within their sales division. While there, he created the early arcade game Demolition Derby in his garage. Completed in early 1975 using Fairchild's new F8 microprocessors, Demolition Derby was among the earliest microprocessor-driven games. In the mid-1970s, Lawson was made Chief Hardware EngineerCG Expo 99 Panel announcement and director of engineering and marketing for Fairchild's video game division. There, he led the development of the Fairchild Channel F console, released in 1976 and specifically designed to use swappable game cartridges based on technology licensed from Alpex \\"The Untold Story Of The Invention Of The Game Cartridge\\". FastCompany.. At the time, most game systems had the game programming built into the game hardware, which could not be removed. Lawson and his team refined and improved technology developed at Alpex that allowed games stored as software on removable ROM cartridges that could be inserted and removed from a console unit repeatedly, and without electrically shocking the user. \\"The Untold Story Of The Invention Of The Game Cartridge\\". FastCompany. This would allow users to buy into a library of games, and provided a new revenue stream for the console manufacturers through sales of these games. The Channel F console featured a wide variety of controls, including a unique 8-way joystick designed by Lawson and a \\"pause\\" button, which was a first for a home video game console. The Channel F was not a commercially successful product, but the cartridge approach was popularized with the Atari 2600 released in 1977.\\"Interview: Jerry Lawson, Black Video Game Pioneer\\". Vintage Computing and Gaming, February 24, 2009. While he was with Fairchild, Lawson and Ron Jones were the sole black members of the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of early computer hobbyists that included a number of industry legends, including Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Lawson had noted he had interviewed Wozniak for a position at Fairchild, but did not hire him. In 1980, Lawson left Fairchild and founded Videosoft, a video game development company that made software for the Atari 2600 in the early 1980s, as the 2600 had displaced the Channel F as the top system in the market.Squires, David (August 1985). \\"The Mixed Signals in High Tech's Future\\". Black Enterprise. p. 109. Videosoft closed about five years later, and Lawson started to take on consulting work. At one point, he had been working with Stevie Wonder to produce a \\"Wonder Clock\\" that would wake a child with the sound of a parent's voice, though it never made it to production. Lawson later worked with the Stanford mentor program and was preparing to write a book on his career. In March 2011, Lawson was honored as an industry pioneer for his work on the game cartridge concept by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA). Lawson was honored with the ID@Xbox Gaming Heroes award at the 21st Independent Games Festival on March 20, 2019 for leading the development of the first cartridge-based game console. There is a display of Lawson's contribution to the gaming industry on permanent display at The World Video Game Hall of Fame at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. Death Around 2003, Lawson started having complications from diabetes, losing the use of one leg and sight from one eye. On April 9, 2011, about one month after being honored by the IGDA, he died of complications from diabetes. At the time of his death, he resided in Santa Clara, California, and was survived by his wife, two children, and his brother.  In popular culture  A short documentary on Jerry Lawson and his development of the Fairchild Channel F was produced by The Czar of Black Hollywood director Bayer Mack and released by Block Starz Music Television as part of its Profiles of African- American Success video series. He was also featured in the first episode of the Netflix limited-series documentary High Score, released August 19, 2020, with his story told by his children Karen and Anderson. The first episode of Season 6 of Command Line Heroes, \\"Jerry Lawson: The Engineer Who Changed the Game\\", covers his work on the Channel F.

Acquiring Borreby Castle in 1783, he was the first Castenschiold to own the manor which has been held by the family ever since. Biography He was son of Johan Lorentz von Castenschiold of Knapstrup and his wife Jacoba von Holten. In 1760, Castenschiold went into training as an officer at the Slesvigske Kyrasserregiment, and was eventually promoted to major in 1776. He became commander of the Royal Danish Mounted Guard in 1784 (the regiment was eventually closed down in 1866). He was promoted further, becoming major general in 1788, and finally lieutenant general in 1802. On a more curious note, Castenschiold became involved in the coup d'état against Count Struensee in 1772. Because of Queen Caroline Matilda's dislike of Castenschiold, he was chosen to escort her to Kronborg together with 30 dragoons after she was arrested. In 1807, Castenschiold led the East Danish (mainly Zealandic) territorial force, which was established to fight Britain during the Napoleonic Wars. His efforts culminated in the Battle of Køge on 29 August 1807, where Castenschiold's force of around 7,000 militiamen was defeated by the well-equipped British forces under General Arthur Wellesley (later 1st Duke of Wellington). Castenschiold was later prosecuted together with the other military leaders in Copenhagen, but was acquitted. Personal life He was part of the landed gentry. In 1781, when he was in his late thirties, he married Elisabeth Behagen. His holdings included the manor Borreby Castle which has been owned by his descendants ever since. He died on 6 April 1817 at Borreby and is buried at Magleby Church. In popular culture Castenschiold appears as a character in Bernard Cornwell's 2001 novel Sharpe's Prey.

Until 2006, it was shown each week on the BBC and is now licensed for national versions around the world. The following is a list of presenters who have hosted the BBC show, including the many guest presenters over the years. 1960s–1970s Upon its inception in 1964, Top of the Pops was presented by a team of disc jockeys in rotation: Alan Freeman, David Jacobs, Pete Murray and Jimmy Savile, who presented the very first episode from Manchester on 1 January 1964 and would continue as the longest-serving presenter until hosting his final show on 30 August 1984. Samantha Juste appeared as the disc girl for several episodes until 1967.

Of these only Ed Stewart and John Peel would become long-term regulars, though there would be a gap before either would return as such. By 1970, only Savile and Blackburn remained of the 1960s regulars and between them they would host all the editions from January 1970 until their duopoly was broken by Ed Stewart's return in March 1971. *Tony Blackburn (1967–1979 and 1981–1983, plus 31 December 1988, 4 April 2003 and 30 July 2006) *Emperor Rosko (1967, 1974–1975) *Stuart Henry (1967–1969) *Dave Cash (1968) *Kenny Everett (1967 and 1973, plus 31 December 1988) *John Peel co-hosted a single edition in 1968, but returned more prominently in the 1980s (see below). *Ed Stewart (1968, 1971–1977) *David Symonds (1968) *14 December 1967 – Mike Lennox co-presented with Alan Freeman *14 March 1968 – Tom Edwards co- presented with Jimmy Savile *11 April 1968 – Lulu co-presented with Jimmy Savile *2 May 1968 – Alan Price co-presented with Alan Freeman *23 May 1968 – Micky Dolenz of The Monkees co-presented with Jimmy Savile *6 June 1968 – Davy Jones of The Monkees co-presented with Jimmy Savile 1970s–1980s *Jimmy Savile (1964–1984, plus 31 December 1988, 19 October 2001, 19 September 2003 and 30 July 2006) *Tony Blackburn (1967–1979, 1981–1983, plus 31 December 1988, 4 April 2003 and 30 July 2006) *Ed Stewart (1968,1971–1977) *Noel Edmonds (1972–1978, plus 5 May 1983) *Kenny Everett (1973, plus 31 December 1988) *Greg Edwards (1974) *Dave Lee Travis (1973–1984, plus 30 July 2006) *Emperor Rosko (1974–1975) *David Hamilton (1975–1977, plus 31 December 1988) *Paul Burnett (1975, 1977–1979, plus 25 December 1981 and 30 September 1982) *David \\"Kid\\" Jensen (1977–1984, plus 31 December 1988) *Peter Powell (1977–1988) *Mike Read (1978–1989, plus 30 July 2006) *Simon Bates (1979–1988) *15 December 1977 – Elton John was guest presenter *11 October 1979 – Andy Peebles presented though did not become a regular host until 1981 (see 1980s–1991 below) 1980s–1991 The close association with Radio 1 continued into the 1980s, with all TOTP presenters drawn from the ranks of DJs at the station. The list below represents the main TOTP presenters during this period with many other Radio 1 DJs, for example Liz Kershaw, Adrian Juste and Adrian John also appearing on special programmes such as Christmas broadcasts and milestones for TOTP or Radio 1. For this reason, the 30 September 1982 show celebrating Radio 1's fifteenth birthday affords Annie Nightingale, in her one and only appearance and as one of nineteen presenters that day, the honour of being the first female presenter of Top of the Pops, beating Janice Long – who would go on to present TOTP regularly for nearly six years – by three months. By the end of the decade, the bond with Radio 1 seemed unbreakable with the show being simulcast on the station from 1988 and even traffic reporters like Sybil Ruscoe trying their hand at presenting TOTP. Presenters were also brought in from children's television, including Children's BBC presenters Andy Crane and Simon Parkin, Blue Peter's Caron Keating, and Anthea Turner and Jenny Powell who worked together on Saturday morning show UP2U. With the exception of Turner, who presented until 1991, all appointments were short- lived proving indicative of the diffusion TOTP was about to undergo from Radio 1 in the 1990s. *Jimmy Savile (1964–1984, plus 31 December 1988, 19 October 2001, 19 September 2003 and 30 July 2006) *Dave Lee Travis (1974–1984, plus 30 July 2006) *David Jensen also known as \\"Kid Jensen\\" (1976–1984, plus 31 December 1988) *Peter Powell (1977–1988) *Mike Read (1978–1989, plus 30 July 2006) *Simon Bates (1979–1988) *Richard Skinner (1980–1985, plus 6 October 1988 and 19 January 1989) *Tommy Vance (1980–1984) *Steve Wright (1980–1989, plus Top of the Pops 2: 1997–2004, 2006–2007, 2008, 2009) *John Peel (1981–1987, plus 14 December 1995) *Andy Peebles (1979, 1981–1984) *Tony Blackburn (1967–1979, 1981–1983, plus 31 December 1988, 4 April 2003 and 30 July 2006) *Mike Smith (1982–1988) *Janice Long (1982–1988, plus 30 July 2006) *Gary Davies (1982–1991) *Pat Sharp (1982–1983, also a member of British vocal duo Pat and Mick together with Mick Brown, plus 30 July 2006) *Bruno Brookes (1984–1991, 1994–1995) *Dixie Peach (1985–1986) *Paul Jordan (1985–1986) *Simon Mayo (1986–1991, 1994–1996) *Nicky Campbell (1988–1991, 1994–1997) *Mark Goodier (1988–1991, 1994–1996, read the Top 20 chart rundown out-of- vision: 1997–2002) *Andy Crane (1988–1989) *Anthea Turner (1988–1991) *Sybil Ruscoe (1988–1989) *Jenny Powell (1989) *Jackie Brambles (1989–1991) Special appearances: *9 July and 28 August 1980 – B.A. Robertson co-presented with Peter Powell *7 August 1980 – after hosting alone in 1977, Elton John returned to co-host with Peter Powell *14 August 1980 – Roger Daltrey of The Who co- presented with Tommy Vance *21 August 1980 – Cliff Richard co-presented with Steve Wright *4 September 1980 – Kevin Keegan co-presented with Dave Lee Travis *18 September 1980 – Olivia Newton-John co-presented with Simon Bates *25 September 1980 – Russ Abbot co-presented with Mike Read *30 October 1980 – Colin Berry co-presented with Peter Powell *9 July 1981 – Alan Freeman and Pete Murray both returned after over a decade's absence to present with Jimmy Savile *25 December 1981 – Paul Gambaccini co-presented alongside Adrian Juste and former presenter Paul Burnett, with regular presenters Andy Peebles, Dave Lee Travis, Simon Bates, David Jensen, Tony Blackburn, John Peel, Steve Wright, Peter Powell, Jimmy Savile, Richard Skinner and Mike Read *25 March 1982 – footballer Garth Crooks co-presented with Peter Powell *27 May 1982 – Debbie Harry of Blondie was guest presenter with John Peel. *30 September 1982 – Radio 1 celebrated its fifteenth anniversary with a special TOTP featuring DJs Paul Gambaccini, Adrian John, Adrian Juste, Jonathan King, Alexis Korner and Annie Nightingale, as well as former presenter Paul Burnett and regular presenters Dave Lee Travis, Andy Peebles, Mike Read, David Jensen, Tony Blackburn, John Peel, Jimmy Savile, Mike Smith, Steve Wright, Tommy Vance, Richard Skinner and Peter Powell *5 May 1983 – TOTP celebrated its thousandth show with the return of Noel Edmonds and David Jacobs as well as Paul Gambaccini and regular presenters Dave Lee Travis, Steve Wright, John Peel, Gary Davies, Mike Smith, Peter Powell, Simon Bates, Tommy Vance, Richard Skinner, Mike Read, Tony Blackburn, David Jensen, Andy Peebles, Janice Long, Jimmy Savile and Pat Sharp *29 December 1983 – Adrian John guest presented with Tommy Vance, Richard Skinner, Peter Powell and Gary Davies *25 December 1984 – no regular presenters featured with performers linking between songs *27 December 1984 – Lenny Henry *25 December 1985 – Jonathan King was guest presenter alongside John Peel, Janice Long, Dixie Peach, Steve Wright and Gary Davies *5 May 1988 – Adrian John co-presented with Bruno Brookes *11 August 1988 – Liz Kershaw was guest presenter with Bruno Brookes *6 October 1988 – Richard Skinner returned after three years to co-present with Simon Mayo *20 October 1988 – Caron Keating of Blue Peter co-presented with Steve Wright *17 November 1988 – Susie Mathis co-presented with Gary Davies *8 December 1988 – Caron Keating co-presented with Nicky Campbell *31 December 1988 – TOTP's 25th anniversary saw the return of Jimmy Savile, David Jacobs, Pete Murray, Alan Freeman, Kenny Everett, David Jensen, Tony Blackburn, David Hamilton and Peter Powell along with Paul Gambaccini alongside regular presenters Simon Bates, Mark Goodier and Mike Read *19 January 1989 – Richard Skinner co-presented with Bruno Brookes *23 February 1989 – Susie Mathis co-presented with Bruno Brookes *9 March 1989 – Lenny Henry co-presented with Hale and Pace and Nicky Campbell for Comic Relief.

Tony Dortie and Claudia Simon had been working for Children's BBC, with Dortie having presented Saturday morning magazine UP2U (with former TOTP presenters Jenny Powell and Anthea Turner) in the summers of 1988 and 1989 and Simon being one of the presenters of BFT in 1990. Elayne Smith was an underground club DJ and compere who started hosting Channel 4 late-night variety show The 291 Club just a few weeks before the revamp. Smith left after just two episodes to concentrate on The 291 Club and was replaced in March 1992 by Femi Oke who was working at BBC Radio 5, whilst 17-year-old Mark Franklin was picked from local radio station BBC Radio Wiltshire. With a new theme tune and set of titles modelled on a weathervane, the first show was presented by Mark Franklin and Tony Dortie on 3 October 1991 with the first live performance Erasure's \\"Love to Hate You\\". The first show of the revamp attracted 8.93m viewers, over 1m up on the show's average. Performance rules were altered so that acts had to sing live whether they wanted to or not and performances reflected the current album charts and American Billboard Hot 100 as well as the UK Singles Chart. Two presenters from the team always hosted each episode until July 1992 when Tony Dortie and Mark Franklin began to host some shows individually. By October 1992, the rest of the team had been dropped completely. *Mark Franklin (1991–1994) *Tony Dortie (1991–1994) *Elayne Smith (7 November and 5 December 1991) *Claudia Simon (1991–1992) *Adrian Rose (1991–1992) *Steve Anderson (1991–1992) *Femi Oke (1992) Special appearances: *2 April 1992 – Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse were guest presenters under the alias of Smashie and Nicey *18 June 1992 – Bob Geldof guested as a co-presenter with Mark Franklin *17 December 1992 – Mr Blobby guested as a co-presenter with Tony Dortie *25 December 1992 – Sid Owen and Danniella Westbrook of EastEnders made guest appearances with Tony Dortie and Mark Franklin *25 December 1993 – Patsy Palmer of EastEnders made a guest appearance with Tony Dortie and Mark Franklin *4 January 1994 – Smashie and Nicey returned to present a special 30th birthday show *20 January 1994 – Joe Elliott of Def Leppard guested as a co-presenter with Tony Dortie On Thursday 11 June 1992, BBC1 screened England's Euro 92 0–0 draw with Denmark so TOTP was moved to Saturday 13 June, broadcast at 5:30pm. 1994: Return of the Radio 1 DJs The presentation changes introduced in 1991 did not have the impact producers had hoped for and by 1993 only Mark Franklin and Tony Dortie remained from the revamped team. Despite claiming 9m viewers in January 1992, the success of the revamp was short-lived and by May 1992 less than 6.5m were tuning in – a figure which remained fairly constant for the next eighteen months. Reasons for the sustained lack of popularity for the show ranged wildly from a general apathy towards the music that featured in the charts at this time to claims that the graphics styled around the 'weathervane' idea were hard to read. Dortie and Franklin presented the show individually in rotation until January 1994 when Ric Blaxill replaced Stanley Appel as executive producer. Blaxill had produced shows for Radio 1 and had survived the first wave of change under new station controller Matthew Bannister which had seen many of the DJs deemed too old for the station to resign or be sacked. Of those DJs that survived Bannister's cull, Simon Mayo, Mark Goodier and Nicky Campbell had all presented TOTP prior to the 1991 revamp and were all reinstated as presenters from 3 February 1994. Also returning was Bruno Brookes, another stalwart of the pre-1991 presenting team, though he was fired from Radio 1 in a second wave of Bannister cullings in February 1995 and accordingly he left the Top of the Pops presenting roster in April. Newer recruits to Radio 1, including Lisa I'Anson, Wendy Lloyd, Claire Sturgess and Jo Whiley, augmented the presenting line-up. Blaxill's ambition was to make the show seem like an event and he wanted the presentation between each song to be as spontaneous as the music it was introducing. To do this Blaxill introduced the 'golden microphone' and increasingly experimented with celebrity guest presenters, mainly drawn from the realms of comedy and sport, as well as pop stars who were not promoting a single that week, to introduce the show. *Simon Mayo (1994–1995, plus 30 August 1996) *Mark Goodier (1994–1995, plus 28 March 1996) *Bruno Brookes (1994–1995) *Nicky Campbell (1994–1997) *Jo Whiley (1995–1998, plus 23 April and 14 May 2006) (with Steve Lamacq 1995–1996) *Lisa I'Anson (1995–1996) 1994–1996: The golden mic – celebrity guest presenters *17 March 1994 – Robbie Williams and Mark Owen of Take That *7 April 1994 – Andi Peters *14 April 1994 – Meat Loaf *12 May 1994 – Jack Dee *19 May 1994 – Alice Cooper co-presented with Bruno Brookes *9 June 1994 – Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer *16 June 1994 – Angus Deayton *7 July 1994 – Reg Presley of The Troggs co-presented with Mark Goodier *21 July 1994 – Julian Clary *25 August 1994 – Malcolm McLaren *1 September 1994 – Claire Sturgess *8 September 1994 – Brian Harvey and Tony Mortimer of East 17 *29 September 1994 – Claire Sturgess *6 October 1994 – Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis *20 October 1994 – Jarvis Cocker of Pulp *3 November 1994 – Kylie Minogue *17 November 1994 – Michelle Gayle *1 December 1994 – Lily Savage *8 December 1994 – Neneh Cherry *15 December 1994 – Damon Albarn of Blur *22 December 1994 – Gary Glitter *25 December 1994 – Take That *5 January 1995 – Jack Dee *26 January 1995 – Eternal *2 February 1995 – Kylie Minogue *9 February 1995 – Gary Olsen *23 February 1995 – Peter Cunnah of D:Ream *2 March 1995 – Keith Allen *16 March 1995 – Lenny Henry *30 March 1995 – P.J. and Duncan *13 April 1995 – Phill Jupitus *27 April 1995 – Chris Evans *4 May 1995 – Whigfield *11 May 1995 – Simon Mayo *18 May 1995 – Lisa I'Anson *25 May 1995 – Stewart Lee and Richard Herring *1 June 1995 – Mark Goodier *8 June 1995 – Nicky Campbell *15 June 1995 – Michelle Gayle *22 June 1995 – Simon Mayo *29 June 1995 – Mark Goodier *6 July 1995 – Wendy Lloyd *13 July 1995 – Dale Winton *20 July 1995 – Gayle Tuesday *27 July 1995 – Craig McLachlan *3 August 1995 – Mark Goodier *10 August 1995 – Lisa I'Anson *17 August 1995 – Wendy Lloyd *24 August 1995 – Jarvis Cocker *31 August 1995 – Dale Winton *7 September 1995 – Jo Brand and Mark Lamarr *14 September 1995 – Robbie Williams *21 September 1995 – Simon Mayo *28 September 1995 – Jo Whiley and Steve Lamacq *5 October 1995 – Gareth Hale and Norman Pace *12 October 1995 – Nicky Campbell *19 October 1995 – Stewart Lee and Richard Herring *26 October 1995 – Simon Mayo *2 November 1995 – Suggs *9 November 1995 – Lee Evans *16 November 1995 – Louise *23 November 1995 – Nicky Campbell *30 November 1995 – Jack Dee *7 December 1995 – Gary Glitter *14 December 1995 – John Peel *21 December 1995 – Ronan Keating and Stephen Gately of Boyzone *25 December 1995 – Jack Dee and Björk *4 January 1996 – Nicky Campbell *11 January 1996 – Lisa I'Anson *18 January 1996 – Alan Davies *25 January 1996 – Lulu *1 February 1996 – Lee Evans *8 February 1996 – Julian Cope *15 February 1996 – Justine Frischmann of Elastica *22 February 1996 – Lisa I'Anson *29 February 1996 – Nicky Campbell *7 March 1996 – Louise Wener of Sleeper *14 March 1996 – MN8 *21 March 1996 – Jo Whiley and Steve Lamacq *28 March 1996 – Mark Goodier *4 April 1996 – Dale Winton *11 April 1996 – Andi Peters *18 April 1996 – Bear van Beers *25 April 1996 – Chris Eubank *2 May 1996 – Michelle Gayle *9 May 1996 – Bear van Beers *16 May 1996 – Ian Wright *23 May 1996 – Skin of Skunk Anansie *30 May 1996 – Jack Dee and Jeremy Hardy On 13 June 1996, BBC1 showed coverage of Switzerland vs Netherlands from Euro '96. Top of the Pops was accordingly moved from the Thursday to Friday, originally as a temporary move to incorporate the BBC's expansive portfolio of sport (as well as Euro '96, the 1996 Summer Olympic Games were also broadcast on the channel that summer), though it soon became clear that the move was permanent and, apart from a couple of one-off occasions on 25 June 1998 and 9 August 2001, TOTP never again returned to its original Thursday night slot. *14 June 1996 – Mark Owen *21 June 1996 – Julia Carling *28 June 1996 – Gina G *5 July 1996 – Mark Morrison *12 July 1996 – Bear van Beers *19 July 1996 – Keith Allen as 'Keithski' *2 August 1996 – Jas Mann of Babylon Zoo *9 August 1996 – Peter Andre *23 August 1996 – Bear van Beers *6 September 1996 – Julia Carling *13 September 1996 – Dennis Pennis *20 September 1996 – Tony Mortimer *27 September 1996 – Harry Hill *4 October 1996 – Tony Wright of Terrorvision *11 October 1996 – Bear van Beers *18 October 1996 – Nigel Kennedy *1 November 1996 – Julian Clary *8 November 1996 – Frankie Dettori *15 November 1996 – Charlie Higson, John Thomson, Paul Whitehouse and Mark Williams of The Fast Show *29 November 1996 – Ronan Keating and Stephen Gately *6 December 1996 – Gary Glitter *13 December 1996 – Ian Broudie of The Lightning Seeds *20 December 1996 – Shaun Ryder of Black Grape *25 December 1996 – Spice Girls, whose three performances were introduced by Robbie Williams, Mark Morrison and Gina G 1994: Top of the Pops 2 and the magazine As the show entered its fourth decade, Blaxill exploited the strength of the TOTP brand by introducing a tie-in publication Top of the Pops magazine, first published in January 1995, and by launching a sister show, Top of the Pops 2, to augment the weekly music programme. Originally featuring the best of the main show's studio performances from that week with tips for future hits, the 45-minute-long TOTP2 showcased for the first time the extensive performance archive initially through spotlights on particular artists and a rewind to a given year in music each week. Debuting on 17 September 1994 in a 5.15pm Saturday afternoon slot on BBC Two, Johnnie Walker provided voice-over introductions before the show began to draw solely on archive performances from 1997, when former TOTP host Steve Wright took over. TOTP2 moved to a midweek early-evening slot in 1998, retaining a Saturday afternoon repeat, and regularly became one of the most watched shows on the BBC's second channel. Following a revamp of BBC Two's early peak schedules in 2002, the 45-minute show was given over to two shows of twenty- five minutes, and shows began to select celebrity guest editors, such as Jack Dee, Phill Jupitus and Vic Reeves, to choose their own favourite performances from the archive. After being 'rested' in 2004, a reformatted show featuring two new studio performances per week returned for a final full series in 2006–7, to replace the axed main show. Mark Radcliffe replaced Wright as presenter in 2009. *Johnnie Walker (1994–1997) *Steve Wright (1997–2004, 2006–2007, 2008, 2009) *Mark Radcliffe (2009–) 1997–2000: Into the new millennium Ric Blaxill left in 1997, and the show was temporarily looked after by Mark Wells who continued his predecessor's policy of having rotating guest presenters. By this time, only Jo Whiley remained of the Radio 1 DJs introduced to the show by Blaxill, though Wells added Radio 1 Breakfast Show caretakers Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley to the roster (although both Whiley and Radcliffe & Riley only appeared twice each between Blaxill's exit and the arrival of his permanent successor in June). With a background in 'serious' music broadcasting having worked on Channel 4's The Tube and The White Room, the new executive producer was Chris Cowey who stripped the show of the gimmicks bequeathed by its predecessors, increased the number of studio performances per week whilst reducing the reliance on music videos, and gradually built a new team of regular presenters with backgrounds in music television and radio to replace the celebrity guests. Alongside Whiley, who graduated from occasional host to lead presenter in June 1997, came Jayne Middlemiss and Zoe Ball. Middlemiss had presented music strand The O-Zone for Children's BBC since 1995, whilst Ball was given a full-time role after guest presenting in March 1997, and ahead of her posting as the host of Radio 1's coveted breakfast show in October. Fellow Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs and Never Mind the Buzzcocks host Mark Lamarr were added to the team but were quickly dropped, though Jamie Theakston, co-host with Middlemiss on The O-Zone, and Ball on Live & Kicking arrived in January 1998 after guest presenting the previous October. All would continue to present The O-Zone and Live & Kicking concurrently with TOTP. Ball and Whiley departed in summer 1998 to be replaced by former Smash Hits editor Kate Thornton who established herself with Middlemiss and Theakston as lead presenters by autumn 1998. A revamp in May 1998 which included a change of title sequence, logo and theme music also saw a shift in focus from the Top 40 to the Top 20, with the chart rundown, now voiced every week by Radio 1 Chart Show host and former TOTP presenter Mark Goodier, extended from the Top 10 to Top 20. Children's TV presenter and model Gail Porter and Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills augmented the line-up from March 1999, and though Mills left in August, Porter continued with Middlemiss and Theakston as lead presenters into the new millennium. *Jo Whiley (1995–1998, plus 23 April and 14 May 2006) *Jayne Middlemiss (1997–2001) *Zoe Ball (1997–1998, 19 October 2001) *Jamie Theakston (3 October 1997, 1998–2002, 2003) *Kate Thornton (1998–1999) *Gail Porter (1999–2001) *Scott Mills (1999) 1997: More celebrity guest presenters *17 January 1997 – Rhona Cameron *24 January 1997 – Phil Daniels *31 January 1997 – Noddy Holder *7 February 1997 – Ardal O'Hanlon *14 February 1997 – Peter Andre *21 February 1997 – Ant and Dec *28 February 1997 – Ian Wright *14 March 1997 – Ian Broudie *21 March 1997 – Kylie Minogue *28 March 1997 – Zoe Ball *4 April 1997 – Mark and Lard (Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley) *11 April 1997 – Mark Owen *18 April 1997 – Louise *25 April 1997 – Dannii Minogue *2 May 1997 – Cathy Dennis *16 May 1997 – Dannii Minogue *23 May 1997 – Mark and Lard *30 May 1997 – The Spice Girls *1 August 1997 – Mary Anne Hobbs *8 August 1997 – Phill Jupitus *15 August 1997 – Denise van Outen *22 August 1997 – Sarah Cawood *12 September 1997 – Mark Lamarr *3 October 1997 – Jamie Theakston *10 October 1997 – Mark Lamarr *31 October 1997 – Mary Anne Hobbs *28 November 1997 – Mark Lamarr *13 November 1998 – Katy Hill *10 September 1999 - Ana Boulter & Steve Wilson co-presented with Gail Porter *17 September 1999 – Emma Ledden & Ana Boulter *TOTP toured the country between 26 August (a rare Thursday show, broadcast on BBC2) and 15 October 1999. These shows were broadcast from different cities' nightclubs, in order: The Revolution, Edinburgh; Event II, Brighton; Club Wow, Sheffield; L2, Liverpool; Ikon, Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Dome II, Birmingham Black Orchid (Nottingham) and Time & Icon, Swansea *Former presenter Mark Goodier returned to voice the Top 20 countdown between 1997 and 2002. At the beginning of 2003, he was temporarily replaced by Scott Mills. Wes Butters voiced the countdown from February to November 2003. 2000–2003: Developing the brand Richard Blackwood became joint lead presenter in August 2000 and presented in rotation with Jayne Middlemiss, Jamie Theakston and Gail Porter. In July 2001, Blackwood left the presenting roster, with Middlemiss leaving the following month. Josie D'Arby, who had hosted an episode in October 2000, made a short- lived return in autumn 2001 but joined Gail Porter in exiting before the end of the year leaving Jamie Theakston as lead presenter until March 2002 when he was replaced by new recruits model Lisa Snowdon and former TOTP guest presenter Sarah Cawood. Liz Bonnin joined the team from Channel 4 breakfast show RI:SE in May and the majority of shows throughout 2002 were presented by these three presenters, with Theakston only returning for sporadic appearances, and again on a couple of occasions in 2003. After the 2000th edition on 13 September 2002, the presenting team continued to rotate solely between Liz Bonnin, Lisa Snowdon, Sarah Cawood alongside the returning Richard Blackwood until the new year. Blackwood's final show came on Christmas Day 2002, but the three females continued to present through 2003 along with an increasing number of occasional presenters drawn mainly from breakfast television and Radio 1. Colin Murray and Edith Bowman joined their former RI:SE teammate Liz Bonnin in mid-2003 and, though both were used sparingly, Bowman would return as relief presenter in 2006. Konnie Huq also presented three shows concurrent with her role as Blue Peter presenter in 2003. More successful was Huq's former Blue Peter colleague and The Big Breakfast host Richard Bacon who joined the presenting roster in January 2003, graduating to lead presenter by September. Along with newcomers and former children's television hosts Margherita Taylor, Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates, this quartet presented in rotating pairs until another revamp of TOTP took place in November 2003. *Jo Whiley (1997–1998) *Jayne Middlemiss (1997–2001) *Jamie Theakston (1997–2002, 2003) *Gail Porter (1999–2001, plus 2 May 2003) *Richard Blackwood (2000–2001, 2002) *Josie D'Arby (6 October 2000, 2001) *Sarah Cawood (2002–2003, plus 30 July 2006) *Lisa Snowdon (2002–2003) *Liz Bonnin (2002–2003) *Richard Bacon (2003, 2005–2006) *Colin Murray (2003) *Edith Bowman (2003, 2006) *Margherita Taylor (2003, plus 15 April 2005) *Konnie Huq (2003) *Fearne Cotton (2003, 2004–present) *Reggie Yates (2003, 2004–present) Guest appearances: *14 April 2000 – Sara Cox & Ana Boulter *29 May 2000 – Chris Moyles co-presented a special Bank Holiday Monday edition from Sheffield Arena as part of BBC Music Live alongside Jamie Theakston *6 October 2000 – Josie D'Arby *24 December 2000 – CBBC presenter Adrian Dickson hosted the Tweenies special *25 December 2000 – Sara Cox co-hosted with Jamie Theakston and Richard Blackwood *9 August 2001 – Sophie Ellis-Bextor, a show which was moved to Thursday *19 October 2001 – Zoe Ball and Jimmy Savile returned to present a show heralding the return to BBC Television Centre after ten years of recording at Elstree, with Jamie Theakston and Dermot O'Leary *16 November 2001 – Vernon Kay and Ana Boulter *25 December 2001 – Sara Cox co-hosted with Jamie Theakston *8 February 2002 – Dermot O'Leary *19 April 2002 – Melanie B *7 March 2003 – Ben Elton *4 April 2003 – Tony Blackburn co-hosted with Sarah Cawood and Lisa Snowdon *2 May 2003 – Gail Porter, former presenter, returns to co-host with Richard Bacon *27 June 2003 – Jonathan Ross co-presented with Fearne Cotton *15 August 2003 – Jack Osbourne co-presented with Edith Bowman *7 November 2003 – Ronan Keating co-hosted with Fearne Cotton, almost eight years after last appearing as a mid-'90s guest presenter  2002–2006: Top of the Pops Saturday  In September 2002, in an attempt to combat the increasing ratings success of ITV's rival chart show CD:UK, the Top of the Pops brand diversified and a children's TV spin-off was created to run alongside the main show. Top of the Pops Saturday began on 21 September 2002 as a segment to fill the final 45 minutes of the BBC One Saturday morning kids programme The Saturday Show, presented by Fearne Cotton, who would graduate to presenting the main show from 2003. For the first season, Cotton co-presented with Simon Grant. Cotton alone continued to present the show after The Saturday Show ended its second season in 2003, with TOTP Saturday gaining its own stand- alone slot on BBC One at 11.00am, immediately following The Saturday Show's replacement Dick and Dom in da Bungalow. Following the removal of Saturday morning children's television from BBC One to BBC Two in 2005, the show was renamed Top of the Pops: Reloaded from 17 September until its end in March 2006. For this final season, Cotton was joined by former Pop Idol contestants Sam and Mark and Radio 1 DJs JK and Joel as co-presenters. The final show was shown on 25 March 2006. *Fearne Cotton (all episodes 2002–2006, plus the main TOTP show: 2003, 2004–) *Simon Grant (2002–2003) *Sam Nixon (2005–2006) *Mark Rhodes (2005–2006) *Jason King (2005–2006) *Joel Ross (2005–2006) 2003: All New Top of the Pops revamp In 2003, former Top of the Pops presenter Andi Peters became new executive producer and began another radical overhaul. The first edition of All New Top of the Pops was broadcast on 28 November 2003, presented live by former MTV video jockey Tim Kash. The ratings for the first show were 5.65m. Kash presented shows alone until 30 April 2004, after which he began to present with previous presenters Fearne Cotton and/or Reggie Yates, who eventually began to present shows together without Kash. After presenting 14 February 2003 episode, Cotton became a more prominent presenter from June 2003, with Yates also joining the presenting roster in August. Both continued to present regularly until the November 2003 revamp. Kash left to rejoin MTV, making his last appearance in August 2004, allowing Cotton and Yates to present alone. For three shows in October and November 2004, Radio 1 Breakfast Show host Chris Moyles was drafted in to co-host alongside Cotton and Yates, and this trio also fronted the last show of 2004 before Christmas in a show styled as a Radio 1 Christmas party. In 2003, Tim Kash became only the third presenter, after Jimmy Savile in 1971 and Noel Edmonds in 1978, to host Christmas Top of the Pops solo. *Tim Kash (2003–2004) *Fearne Cotton (2004–) *Reggie Yates (2004–) *Chris Moyles (2004, plus 29 May 2000, 22 April 2005 and 14 May 2006) Only two shows between April 2004 and March 2006 did not feature either Fearne Cotton or Reggie Yates: *6 February 2004 – Natalie Brown covered Kash when he was absent. *15 April 2005 – Richard Bacon and Margherita Taylor returned as relief presenters to host, eighteen months after their last show together. *22 April 2005 – Chris Moyles and his Radio 1 breakfast show colleagues, Aled Haydn Jones, Rachel Jones and Dave Vitty were guest presenters. 2005–2006: The move to BBC Two and the end – return of guest presenters In November 2004, it was announced that Top of the Pops would move from its primetime slot on Friday nights on BBC One to a new Sunday night slot on BBC Two, a move largely viewed as the last sidelining of the show before inevitable cancellation. The move was initially intended to take place in Spring 2005 and an 'extended format' was promised but the show remained on BBC One until July 2005 with the final Friday show on 8 July followed by another episode the following Monday. The first BBC Two show ran for 35 minutes, five minutes longer than the BBC One show, and aired live on Sunday 17 July 2005 at 7pm, immediately after the announcement of the new week's chart and incorporated elements of TOTP2, which had been rested a year previously, by showing two archive performances alongside the new music. However, viewing figures halved within a fortnight of the new scheduling, from an average of 2.4 million viewers on BBC One to around 1.5 million on BBC Two. The ratings never improved, despite the show going on location to the 2006 Winter Olympics and Radio 1's One Big Weekend, and on 20 June 2006 the BBC announced that Top of the Pops was being axed due to no longer being able to compete with 24-hour cable music channels, with the final episode airing on 30 July 2006. New executive producer Mark Cooper oversaw a return to the use of guest presenters, a full list of which is given below, but unlike in the '90s, this time the celebrities were paired with one of the already established lead presenting team of Fearne Cotton, Reggie Yates, and newcomer comedian Rufus Hound. The three lead presenters appeared on all of the BBC Two shows between them and when not joined by a celebrity co-host they presented in pairs with each other or with one of the secondary presenting team of Richard Bacon and, from January 2006, Edith Bowman. Occasionally, the show was moved from Sunday nights but remained a live broadcast, as was the case on the following Mondays: 15 August 2005, 16 January 2006 and the five shows between 13 February and 13 March 2006. The show was also once transmitted on a Tuesday: 11 July 2006. In May 2006, BBC staff were asked to form the audience for several Top of the Pops shows after it emerged that the BBC did not have a premises licence for hosting public entertainment events at Television Centre.

Fearne Cotton, who was unavailable, also presented a brief pre-recorded segment from Fiji(3.98m viewers) After the end: Occasional events-led returnsTop of the Pops 2= After being taken off the air in 2004, sister show Top of the Pops 2 was resurrected for a new run on Saturday nights at 8pm which reverted to the old format of mixing archive clips with new studio performances. The new series began two months after the original show ended, on Saturday 30 September 2006, with new studio performances provided by Nelly Furtado and Razorlight and a Top 10 chart rundown. All the episodes in this series followed the familiar TOTP2 presentation of no on-screen presentation, but rather a voiceover from Steve Wright: *30 September 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Razorlight: America and Nelly Furtado: Promiscuous *7 October 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Richard Hawley: Just Like The Rain and Jamelia: Something About You *14 October 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Nerina Pallot: Sophia and Seth Lakeman: The White Hare *21 October 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Amy Winehouse: Rehab *28 October 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Vincent Vincent and the Villains: Johnny Two Bands *4 November 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); All Saints: Rock Steady and Gnarls Barkley: Who Cares *11 November 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Emma Bunton: Downtown and Ray Lamontagne: How Come *18 November 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Sandy Thom: Lonely Girl and Tony Bennett: Lullaby of Broadway *25 November 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Damien Rice: 9 Crimes *2 December 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); The Fratellis: Whistle for the Choir *9 December 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Lil Chris: Gettin' Enough and Lily Allen: Littlest Things *16 December 2006 – Steve Wright (voice only); Kasabian: Empire *6 January 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Muse: Starlight *13 January 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Just Jack: Starz in their Eyes *20 January 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Regina Spektor: Fidelity *3 February 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Simon Webbe: My Soul Pleads For You, Duke Special: Freewheel and Kaiser Chiefs: Ruby *10 February 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); The Feeling: Rose, Louise Setara: Wrong Again and Findlay Brown: Come Here *17 February 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Jack Savoretti: Dreamers and James Hunter: No Smoke Without Fire *24 February 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); The View: Same Jeans and Corinne Bailey Rae: I'd Like To *3 March 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Madness: Sorry *10 March 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Westlife: Total Eclipse of The Heart and Maximo Park: Our Velocity *17 March 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Good Charlotte: The River, Lemar: Tick Tock and Muse: Invincible *24 March 2007 – Steve Wright (voice only); Kaiser Chiefs: The Angry Mob Following the 2006–7 run, TOTP2 returned only to mark one-off special occasions and dropped the new performances. Such shows were dedicated to certain musicians such as Wham! and Duran Duran in 2010, as well as the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, or marked special occasions such as Christmas and New Year in 2008 and 2009, or tie-ins with a particular season of BBC programmes such as the School season which featured a back-to-school special to mark the end of the 2010 summer holidays, and an '80s-themed show to mark the final series of BBC TV drama Ashes to Ashes, also in 2010. =Continued TOTP= As well as the intermittent broadcasts of TOTP2 on BBC Two and a yearly Christmas show which remains on BBC One, Top of the Pops is survived by occasional 'event-led' broadcasts. It has twice returned for special shows for the BBC's biennial Comic Relief charity fundraiser in 2007 and 2009, with the following presenters: *16 March 2007 – Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May – Top Gear of the Pops for Comic Relief 2007 *13 March 2009 – Fearne Cotton, Reggie Yates, Noel Fielding, French and Saunders, Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross, David Tennant and Claudia Winkleman – Comic Relief does Top of the Pops An annual BBC One show which looks back at the previous year in music also appears each Christmas Day at 2pm. In 2008, 2009, and since 2012, a second episode has followed on or around New Year's Eve with a New Year's Eve party theme: *25 December 2006 – Fearne Cotton, Reggie Yates and Edith Bowman *25 December 2007 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2008 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *31 December 2008 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2009 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *31 December 2009 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2010 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2011 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2012 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *31 December 2012 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2013 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *31 December 2013 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2014 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *31 December 2014 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2015 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *1 January 2016 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2016 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *31 December 2016 – Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates *25 December 2017 – Fearne Cotton and Clara Amfo *31 December 2017 - Fearne Cotton and Clara Amfo *25 December 2018 - Fearne Cotton and Clara Amfo *28 December 2018 - Fearne Cotton and Clara Amfo *25 December 2019 - Fearne Cotton and Clara Amfo *30 December 2019 - Fearne Cotton and Clara Amfo The BBC has faced repeated calls for the return of the weekly chart show, but has insisted that this will never happen. In August 2010, however, the BBC disclosed that it was in talks with independent production companies with a view to developing a new weekly music show for BBC Three to begin sometime in 2011, although no such show was ever broadcast. However, in 2017 the BBC launched Sounds Like Friday Night, a new live music show hosted by Greg James and Dotty.

Both artists worked from a three- dimensional image of the skull created from multiple CT scans and they did not compare their results while they worked. Chicago artist Joshua Harker used the traditional forensic method in which layers of fat and muscle are built up upon the skull employing the Gatliff-Snow American Tissue Depth Marker Method. Harker superimposed layers of fat, muscle, and flesh upon the skull to build up Meresamun’s appearance. Rather than using a physical reproduction of a skull milled from CT scans, he worked digitally in three-dimensions. The second reconstruction is by Michael Brassell, who was trained in forensic facial imaging by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He works with the Department of Justice/Maryland State Police Missing Persons Unit on the project dubbed NamUs, a database organized by the National Institute of Justice and the Department of Justice that allows smaller police departments and families of missing persons to try to identify skeletal remains. The similarities between the two reconstructions, being the narrow chin, small mouth, prominent cheekbones and shape of the eyes, suggest that both techniques have created a reliable portrait of Meresamun, whose face was last seen 2,800 years ago.

Graziani has been called the first modern baritone because his vocal attributes were well suited to the high-lying operatic parts composed by Giuseppe Verdi, with whom he worked. Early life and career Graziani was born in 1828 in Fermo, Italy. His older brother, Lodovico Graziani (1820–1885), was a dramatic tenor. He studied with Cellini and made his debut In Italy in 1851 at Ascoli Piceno in Donizetti's Gemma di Vergy. The next season, he sang in Macerata, performing Francesco in Verdi's I masnadieri.Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Graziani\\" in Sadie (2001). Graziani also appeared at the Salle Ventadour with the Théâtre-Italien from 1853 to 1861, where he particularly excelled in the operas of Verdi, creating for Paris the role of Count di Luna in Il trovatore and also singing Germont in La traviata, the title role in Rigoletto, and Renato in Un ballo in maschera.Forbes, Elizabeth, \\"Graziani, Francesco\\" in Sadie (1992) 2: 522. In the summer of 1854, he performed with Max Maretzek's Italian opera company at Castle Garden in New York City. Francesco Graziani, 1855 He appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden from 1855 to 1880. His debut was on April 26 as Carlos in Verdi's Ernani, followed by Count di Luna in Verdi's Il Trovatore on May 10, Riccardo in Bellini's I puritani on May 17, Alfonso in Donizetti's La favorita on May 24, and Iago in Rossini's Otello on August 7. He performed the role of Nelusco in the 1865 London premiere of Giacomo Meyerbeer's L'Africaine. Among the other roles he sang in London were the title role in Rigoletto, Renato in Un ballo in maschera, Posa in Don Carlo, and Amonasro in Aida (all by Verdi). His last performance at the house was as Germont in La traviata with Adelina Patti on July 17 in the final performance of the 1880 season.Rosenthal (1958), pp. 107-108, 135, 143, 146, 149, 169, 176, 181, 200. At St Petersburg, on 10 November 1862, he had cemented a spot in operatic history by creating the role of Don Carlos in the first performance of Verdi's La forza del destino. The range of Graziani's voice extended up to A4 and it was much praised by contemporary critics for its smoothness, beauty and ease of production, but his histrionic skills were said to be of a less compelling standard. Graziani later moved to Berlin where he became a voice teacher. Among his pupils was the American soprano Geraldine Farrar. He died on June 30, 1901 at his birthplace, Fermo, in Italy. During his career, Graziani had faced strong competition on stage from a number of other outstanding Italian baritones. Probably the greatest of his immediate rivals was Roman-born Antonio Cotogni, whose voice was of similar quality and range to Graziani's. Graziani brothers Francesco Graziani had three brothers who also sang professionally: * Giuseppe Graziani (born Fermo, August 28, 1819; died Porto San Giorgio, March 6, 1905) was a bass. He studied with Saverio Mercadante in Naples and performed primarily in concerts.Kuhn, p. 285. * Lodovico Graziani (born Fermo, November 14, 1820; died Fermo, May 15, 1885) became a well-known tenor. He created the role of Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata at La Fenice. * Vincenzo Graziani (born Fermo, February 16, 1836; died Fermo, November 2, 1906) became a baritone. His debut in 1862 was as Belcore in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. He gave up his career early, after an illness caused him to become partially deaf. References Sources *Kuhn, Laura, editor (2000).

Its chief distinctives are: * a responsorial structure, with the congregation singing a repeating antiphon between the psalm verses which are sung by a choir or cantor; * unlike plainchant or Anglican chant, the verses have a regular metre. Text Gelineau was himself part of the working group of the French Jerusalem Bible and he developed a revised version of that psalter which respected the rhythms of the Hebrew original. This was later translated into English as the Grail Psalms translation of the Psalter. Verse The psalm verse uses a \\"pulsed tone\\" technique, with a variable number of syllables between the main pulses (barlines). Each line has a prescribed number of accented syllables, even though the total number of syllables varies from line to line. In that sense, it may be regarded as similar to the song Three Blind Mice: each line contains the same number of bars (pulses), but the number of syllables varies from three (\\"Three blind mice\\") to eleven \\"Did ever you see such a thing in your life\\". But unlike that song, Gelineau insists \\"the words must never be allowed to fall into set musical rhythmical patterns which are opposed to the natural relative lengths of their syllables when correctly spoken.\\" It is thus a form of sprung rhythm. Antiphon Unlike the chant-like verses, the antiphon is more like a short hymn-verse in a regular metre. The tempo of the antiphon is directly related to that of the verse: the one-beat-in-the-bar verse equals the beat unit, typically crotchet (quarter note) or dotted crotchet, of the antiphon. There should be no break between psalm and antiphon: each should follow the other without interruption.

History  Hairstyling products have had a significant impact on the creation of various hairstyles and trends throughout history. For the ancient Egyptians, physical appearance was very important to the embalming process. Hair was often styled to maintain the individuality of the deceased. A fatty substance, now known as hair gel, was used to style hair and keep it in place. The 1980s punk movement popularized using hair gel to sculpt spiky hairstyles, such as mohawks. The ancient Gauls had invented a waxy soap-like substance, similar to hair wax, as a hair styling agent. Many years later, the same soap-like substance was used as a cleaning agent. In 1948, Chase Products became the first company to package hair spray. Hair spray became very popular in the 1950s due to its ability to keep hair in place and prevent hair from falling out of a styled look. Types Cans of hairspray =Hair gel= Hair styled with hair gel Hair gel is a hairstyle product that is used to stiffen hair into a particular hairstyle. The end result is similar to, but stronger than, those of hair spray. Hair gel is most commonly used in the hairstyling of men, but it is not gender specific. Hair gel can come in tubes, pots, small bags, or even in a spray form. =Hair wax= A small pot of hair pomade Hair wax is a thick hair styling product containing wax, which helps hold hair in place. Unlike some products such as hair gel which leave the hair hard in texture, hair wax leaves the hair pliable. Many manufacturers are now releasing different versions of hair wax, such as pomade, putty, glue, glypto, whip, and styling paste. =Hair mousse= Hair mousse is a product added to hair for extra volume and shine. It is most commonly produced as a cream, but can also be found as a spray. Hair mousse adds volume without causing clumps or buildup. It is a lighter alternative to hair gel. Mousse is generally applied to the roots of damp hair before blow drying or styling. Mousse may also be used to add definition to curls, or to add texture to hair for a beach blown effect. =Pomade= Pomade is an oil based or water based product designed for slick and tight hairstyles. Unlike hair spray and hair gel, pomade does not dry and often takes several washes to remove. Grease-cutting shampoos and deep-cleansing conditioners can be used to quicken the removal process. Other methods of removal include the use of olive oil, dish washing liquid, and lemon juice. Most oil based pomades contain petroleum jelly (and in fact, petroleum jelly can be used alone as a pomade) and mineral oil, and many also contain some sort of wax. They may also contain perfume and coloring agents. A plethora of pomades are still in production today and vary in factors such as weight, shine, and scent. The stiffest will have a higher proportion of beeswax while the lightest may have a higher proportion of oils. =Hair spray= Hair spray is a common household aqueous solution which is used to stiffen hair into a certain style. It was first developed and manufactured in 1948 by Chase Products, based in Broadview, Illinois. Weaker than hair gel or hair wax, it is sprayed directly onto the hair to hold styles for long periods of time. It sprays evenly over the hair using a pump or aerosol spray nozzle. The product may leave hair feeling 'crunchy' unless brushed out. The active ingredients in hair spray are called polymers, which keep the hair stiff and firm without snapping. Solvents, which make up most of the content of the hairspray, are responsible for carrying these polymers in a solution. Originally, the solvent found in hair spray was a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). CFCs are nontoxic, nonflammable, and make almost ideal aerosol propellants. However, when research concluded that CFCs cause destruction of stratospheric ozone, they were replaced with other solvents, such as alcohols and hydrocarbons. One of the polymers used in hair spray is polyvinylpyrrolidone, which is water- soluble. The non-water-soluble polymer polydimethylsiloxane is added to make the hold last a bit longer. Some less common polymers found in hair spray include copolymers with vinyl acetate and copolymers with maleic anhydride. Some hair sprays use natural polymers and solvents like vegetable gums dissolved in alcohol. One popular ingredient in natural hair sprays is gum arabic, which is made from the sap of various species of the acacia tree. Gum tragacanth is another herbal gum that is used to stiffen calico and crepe, as well as hair. =Hair volumizer= Hair volumizers are used to temporarily add volume, body and shine to thin or flat hair. Hair volumizers are used by both men and women. Men turn to hair volumizers to make their hair look more dense. Volumizers come in many forms such as shampoos, conditioners, sprays, pomades and lotions. Hair volumizers contain humectants, which work by attracting moisture from the surrounding areas to the hair strand, thereby swelling the hair and making it look thicker. Various polymers present in the volumizer coat the hair strand, making it look thicker and shiny. Shampoo and conditioner forms of the volumizers are used just like ordinary shampoo or conditioners. The spray and lotion form of volumizers are used on damp hair near the roots of the hair. In order to use a hair volumizer, the person using the product must flip their head downward and gradually blow dry the hair, with the air being blown along the shaft of the hair until the hair is dry. Drying the hair in this position will increase volume and achieve the desired effect. While the hairstyling products listed above are the most commonly used, there are other types of products as well. Serums, leave-in conditioner, clays, hair tonic, hair dry powder shampoo, and heat protection sprays are frequently used hairstyling products in salons and homes across the country.  Disadvantages  When applied properly, most styling products will not damage the hair. However, there is always a risk of the hair drying out when using any type of styling product. Some styling products contain ingredients that can dissolve the hair's natural oils, or ingredients which can cause a build-up that results in so-called \\"dull hair\\". This build-up of harmful ingredients can cause problems such as dry hair, hair breakage, eczema, or the thinning of hair. When using a hair dryer to dry and shape one's hair, the heat being applied can cause damage to the hair strands. This heat damage can be prevented by using some sort of heat protectant spray.

Plot Nemesis explores the effect of a 1944 polio epidemic on a closely knit, family-oriented Newark Jewish community of Weequahic neighborhood. The children are threatened with maiming, paralysis, lifelong disability, and death. At the center of Nemesis is a vigorous, dutiful, 23-year-old teacher and playground director Bucky Cantor, a javelin thrower and weightlifter, who is devoted to his charges. Bucky feels guilty because his weak eyes have excluded him from serving in the war alongside his close friends and contemporaries. Focusing on Cantor's dilemmas as polio begins to ravage his playground, Roth examines some of the central themes of pestilence: fear, panic, anger, guilt, bewilderment, suffering, and pain. Cantor also faces a spiritual crisis, asking himself why God would allow innocent children to die of polio. Finally, Cantor faces a romantic crisis, becoming engaged to his beloved girlfriend (a fellow teacher who is working as a counselor at a Jewish summer camp). Fearing that Cantor will get polio if he remains in Newark during the summer, she implores him to quit his job in Newark and to join her at her polio-free summer camp. He wants to be with his fiancee, but leaving the children of Newark adds to his feelings of guilt. With the inevitability of a Greek drama, polio eventually reaches the summer camp. One camper dies, several become ill, and Cantor himself is stricken. Cantor blames himself for having brought polio to the camp. The novel ends in 1971, when Cantor encounters one of the Newark playground children who contracted polio and survived. They catch up on the events in their lives since 1944. Cantor reveals that, after being crippled by polio, he insisted that his fiancee leave him and find a non-crippled husband. He never marries. The novel is written as the narrative of the playground child, based on what Cantor told him in 1971.

The station was owned by the Republic Television and Radio Company. KTVQ's studios were located on Northwest 19th Street and North Classen Boulevard in northwest Oklahoma City's Mesta Park neighborhood (in a building that presently houses a commercial retail complex), and its transmitter was located atop the First National Bank Building on North Robinson and Park Avenues in downtown Oklahoma City. Two years after the station ceased operations due to financial difficulties that led to KTVQ's bankruptcy, Republic Television and Radio sold the UHF channel 25 license and construction permit to Independent School District No. 89 of Oklahoma County (now Oklahoma City Public Schools) in July 1958; the school district launched a new station on that channel, KOKH-TV, in February 1959. HistoryEarly history= On June 26, 1952, the Oklahoma County TV and Broadcasting Company—a Chickasha-based company co-owned by Philip D. Jackson and Clarence E. Wilson, joint owners of Chickasha radio station KWCO (1560 AM, now Oklahoma City- licensed KEBC; the KWCO call letters now reside on a radio station on 105.5 FM in Chickasha)—submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit to build and license to operate a broadcast television station in the Oklahoma City market that would transmit on UHF channel 25. The FCC eventually granted the license to Oklahoma County TV and Broadcasting on February 11, 1953; the group subsequently requested and received approval to assign KTVQ (for \\" _T_ ele _v_ ision _Q_ uality\\") as the call letters for his television station. Subsequently, on April 27, the company's principals reached an agreement to transfer the license and permit to the Republic Television and Radio Company, owned by John Esau (then the stockholder and manager of radio stations KTUL [now KTBZ] in Tulsa and KFPW in Fort Smith, Arkansas), oil prospectors Frank E. Brown, Frank Smith and R. P. Green, and attorney A. C. Saunders. Jackson and Wilson received 12¼% interest in Republic in consideration for the transfer. The FCC granted the permit transfer to Republic Television and Radio on August 5. KTVQ first signed on the air on November 1, 1953, operating as an ABC affiliate. (Plans originally called for the station to sign on October 1, later pushed back to October 11.) Channel 25 was ABC's first full-time outlet in the Oklahoma City television market and at the time was one of the relatively few ABC-affiliated stations operating on the UHF dial; it assumed the affiliation from primary NBC affiliate WKY-TV (channel 4, now KFOR- TV)—which had continued to carry select ABC programs under a secondary basic affiliation afterward—as it had carried programming from the network since its sign-on in June 1949. KTVQ was the first television station to sign on in Oklahoma City since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-imposed freeze on television broadcast licenses was lifted in 1953. KTVQ was the first of three commercial television station to sign on in the Oklahoma City market during 1953: another UHF station, KLPR-TV (channel 19, later KMPT; allocation now occupied by Cornerstone Television affiliate KUOT-CD), debuted as a DuMont Television Network affiliate on November 8; KWTV (channel 9) launched as a CBS affiliate on December 20. As with many early UHF stations, reception of KTVQ required television set owners to purchase a standalone UHF tuning adapter. (Set manufacturers were not required to equip televisions with UHF tuners until the Congress passed the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1961, with UHF tuners not included on all newer sets until 1964.) The station conducted a series of promotions to encourage converter adoption including events indended for electronics dealers as well as radio and television commercials directed at the general public. Local programs on KTVQ included Moods in Music (an innovative music series that utilized projection cards containing song lyrics that were superimposed on-screen, accompanied by a hat pin, acting similarly to the \\"bouncing ball\\" seen in singalong versions of movie musicals, moving across the card within the projector), Sidewalk Cafe (a half-hour, weekly variety series featuring instrumental music, interviews and anecdotes, and conducted from a set in the style of a European sidewalk cafe), and sporting events that included Oklahoma A&M; Aggies basketball games (which, due to limitations that prevented live broadcasts of away games, aired as pre-filmed telecasts accompanied by separately recorded play-by-play description), local high school football games, and Monday and Tuesday night home games from the now-defunct Oklahoma City Indians minor league franchise. To promote programs scheduled to air on the station, as area newspapers (such as The Daily Oklahoman and the Oklahoma City Times) were not willing to distribute free radio/TV listings logs at the time, KTVQ announced such shows in a format mirroring local children's programs of the period (and was used for a mid- afternoon children's program featured on the station), in which a puppet carried on a conversation with staff announcer Dick Kirchner discussing upcoming KTVQ programs while written program notes rolled past an opening in the back of the stage housing the puppet. =Financial troubles and shutdown= Along with its existing struggles being a UHF outlet, KTVQ also had to deal with other local stations. WKY-TV had a stronghold on network programming in the market, which Esau contended had exhibited \\"malicious in [NBC's] monopolistic collusion\\" with channel 4. In December 1954, Republic Television and Radio filed a petition for bankruptcy reorganization in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, citing a lack of adequate working capital and temporary financial difficulties, with an estimated debt load totaling $400,000. Later that month, KTVQ was placed under a trusteeship managed by Esau and attorney Duke Duvall, who were appointed by the court as trustees. The FCC granted transfer of control of Republic Television and Radio to the Esau-Duvall trusteeship on January 11, 1955. As part of the reorganization, National Affiliated Television Stations (NATS)—an organization backed by General Electric and National Telefilm Associates to assist financially struggling television stations with finances, management, programming and advertising services—and ABC agreed to a two-year agreement to provide programming and financial services (including the sale of common stock in the company to Republic stockholders and a one-year equipment payment deference) while the station attempted to emerge from bankruptcy; attorney, oilman and rancher E. A. Farris would also become controlling owner of KTVQ, planning to cancel all debts owed in the station in exchange for the station's common voting stock. ABC's cooperation in the reorganization also intended to substantially increase the number of network programs shown on KTVQ's schedule. The Western District Court approved the reorganization plan in May 1955. In January 1955, shortly before the FCC proposed rules to limit television transmission antennas from being located more than from the outskirts of a station's principal city of license, Streets Electronics—owner of Enid-based ABC affiliate KGEO-TV (channel 5, now KOCO-TV)—filed a construction permit application to build a new -tall transmission tower west- northwest of Crescent. Republic Television and Radio Company charged that KGEO wanted to \\"straddle\\" its transmitter between Enid and Oklahoma City to serve both cities, as between 75% and 85% of television set owners in the Enid area owners had oriented their home antennas to receive signals from Oklahoma City and the new tower would provide improved reception in Enid by allowing the signal to propagate into the area at the same direction that these home antennas were aimed, a claim Streets denied. Republic management expressed concern that KGEO's move to the Crescent site would create unfair competition that could hamper the station's already untenable financial situation. Petitions by Republic Television and Radio to set aside the recommendation to grant of the transmitter application and to reopen the record and call attention to the issues the move would cause was denied by the FCC on December 15, 1955. (The agency later granted the Streets transmitter relocation request in a 6-1 vote on May 4, 1956.) That same day, KTVQ suspended operations under court order from the Western Oklahoma District Court \\"until a VHF channel [assignment was] made available to it\\"; the FCC—was considering a proposal to allocate a minimum of three commercial VHF channels in all major markets—did not act on KTVQ's request, resulting in the station being forced to cease transmissions. Station representatives asked the FCC for special temporary authorization to operate on VHF channel 11—which had been assigned to Tulsa as a non-commercial educational allocation—until the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA) could sign on KOED-TV, a satellite of its Oklahoma City flagship KETA-TV (channel 13), intending to broadcast over the transmitter facility of the then-recently defunct KMPT. Governor Raymond D. Gary was among those who supported the proposal; in contrast, OETA and the Joint Committee on Educational Television filed objections to the request, contending that the proposal was \\"tantamount to scrapping the whole table of educational television assignments\\". Sales and acting manager Troy Hoskins stated the station's shutdown had resulted in about 80% of ABC's programming lineup being unavailable to Oklahoma City viewers. The FCC refused the STA request on February 1, 1956; KTVQ management re- submitted the STA request for channel 11 on May 11, with the intent to operate the station on that channel either through the remainder of the term of the construction permit or until OETA—which had withdrawn its opposition to temporary use of the Tulsa channel—was ready to sign on KOED-TV. The station's fate was ultimately sealed when the request was rejected for the second time on July 5, 1956. ABC programming subsequently returned to WKY-TV as a secondary affiliation (KGEO-TV displaced WKY as the network's Oklahoma City affiliate when it moved its operations and changed its city of license from Enid to Oklahoma City in 1958). =Current history of UHF channel 25 in Oklahoma City= On July 25, 1958, the Republic Television and Radio Company donated the construction permit and license to Independent School District No. 89 of Oklahoma County (now Oklahoma City Public Schools), while the company was in the midst of protracted hearings regarding KTVQ's bankruptcy. Although the FCC reserved the UHF channel 25 allocation in Oklahoma City for commercial broadcasting purposes, the school district proposed upon acquiring the permit to operate it as a non-commercial educational independent station. The district requested for KOKH-TV—the base of which assigned at the time to its public radio station on 88.9 FM (now KYLV)—to be assigned as the television station's call letters. KOKH signed on the air on February 2, 1959, with programming originally consisting of instructional and lecture-based telecourse programs developed in cooperation with the Oklahoma State Department of Education for college credit attribution. The school district—citing that operating expenditures outran any benefits and its inability to raise $350,000 in matching funds to replace its existing transmission tower—sold the station for $3.5 million to Blair Broadcasting (a subsidiary of New York City-based John Blair & Co.) on December 14, 1978; Blair later converted KOKH into a general entertainment independent station on October 1, 1979, initially carrying a mix of feature films, cartoons, classic sitcoms, religious programs, some sports programming, and certain network programs preempted by NBC affiliate KTVY (channel 4, now KFOR-TV), ABC affiliate KOCO-TV (channel 5) and CBS affiliate KWTV (channel 9) to carry local or syndicated programming. KOKH became a Fox affiliate on August 15, 1991, as a result of the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA)'s purchase of the network's Oklahoma City charter affiliate, KAUT (channel 43, now an independent station), which became a PBS member station as a companion to OETA flagship station KETA-TV (channel 13). (, KOKH-TV is currently owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group.)

Anson W. Cummings became president of the college and successfully offset the scholarship funding by increasing charges for the music and art departments. The school had nearly 200 students until the Civil War, when it was temporarily closed. After the Civil War, the property was purchased by a stock company and sold to Rev. James Atkins, Jr. The college was renamed Asheville Female College. A newer building was built by the president Rev. James Atkins, A.M., D.D, and J.A. Branner in 1888. With the growth of buildings and equipment there was corresponding growth in the breadth of the curriculum and in those departments which but for the impartation of the various accomplishments which so generally adorn the young women of the day. The personnel and equipment for teaching music, art in various forms, elocution, modern languages, physical culture, etc., were of a high order. On these accounts, together with the unparalleled climate of Asheville, women from twenty-three states, many of them very remote, sought admittance to the college. The school came to attract quite a number of pupils from the North and North-west United States, so that the patronage was much more cosmopolitan in its character than perhaps of any other school in the South. In the first fifty-two years of its history it had matriculated more than eight thousand pupils, most of whom went on to lend the skills of an educated and accomplished womanhood to the homes and circles of which they became a part.

He represented Arthabaska from 1916 to 1936 in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec as a Liberal member. He was born in La Malbaie, Quebec, the son of Joseph-Stanislas Perrault and Louisa Brault. Perrault was educated at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière, at the Séminaire de Québec and the Université Laval. He articled in law with Charles Fitzpatrick, Nazaire-Nicolas Olivier and Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, was called to the Quebec bar in 1898 and set up practice in Arthabaska.

After that, B.C. Partizani Tirana, with or without the help of their legendary captain, Agim Fagu, achieved some good results in European competitions. In the 1979–80 season B.C. Partizani Tirana finished 2nd in the eliminator Group E (in a group with KK Partizan Belgrade, Budapesti Honvéd SE, Al Ittihad Aleppo) of the Champion Club's Cup after KK Partizan Belgrade.

Niane, Sundiata: An Epic of old Mali (China: Pearson Longman, 2006) 1-4. History In the Epic of Sundjata, the king, Naré Maghann Konaté, is the son of a long lineage of hunters distinguished because of their skill, bravery, and ability to communicate with the guardian spirits who ruled over Mali in the 13th century. A hunter comes to him with a prophecy that two hunters would come to the king with a very ugly woman whom he must marry, as she would bear him Mali's greatest king ever. This prophecy does come true, and two hunters arrive with a hunchback woman named Sogolon Kedju. The hunters explain that she is the human double of a buffalo. King Maghan and Sogolon soon conceive a child, named Sundiata. However, Maghan's first wife, Sassouma Berete, was jealous, and had hoped her own son, Dankaran Touman, would be the heir to the throne. Later, Sassouma is relieved when the new child turned out to be lame, gluttonous and ugly. Dying, King Maghan gives Balla Fasséké, the son of the king's own griot, to Sundjata as a gift, still honoring the prophecy. Sassouma now has taken control of the throne, and insults Sogolon and her son often. One day, when Sogolon cries from these insults, Sundjata says, \\"Cheer up, Mother. I am going to walk today.\\" Sundjata, with the help of an iron rod, is able to lift himself up. Sundjata is now a threat to the false king Dankaran and his mother. Sassouma, in response to this, sends Balla Fasséké and Sundjata's half sister Nana to the sorcerer king Suomaoro Kante, of the Sosso, who had been threatening all of the kingdoms with his growing army.

It is also called the Main-Rhön-Bahn (\\"Main-Rhön railway\\") and is listed in the Deutsche Bahn timetable as route (Kursbuchstrecke) 815. The railway has been part of the Erfurt–Schweinfurt route since 1993. Passenger services on the line are provided by DB Regio and the Erfurter Bahn (EB). The Bavarian station in Meiningen  History  After the completion of the first major railway lines in the middle of the 19th century the Bavarian government became very interested in opening up other parts of Bavaria and also in establishing shorter links within the existing railway network. As a result, aspirations arose for a connexion between the Bamberg-Würzburg railway at Schweinfurt and the Werrabahn at Meiningen, not least in order to improve the accessibility of the Saxon-Meiningen provincial capital. So the governments of Bavaria and Saxe-Meiningen signed a state treaty on 21 March 1868 for the establishment of a railway line from Schweinfurt via Neustadt an der Saale to Meiningen. The Bavarian state railway took on the construction and management of the entire route; each government bore the cost of the section of the line on its own territory. Ritschenhausen station In 1871, after railway operations had begun on the line from Schweinfurt to Bad Kissingen via Ebenhausen, work started on the section from Ebenhausen to Meiningen on 14 June 1872. In Meiningen the Bavarian station (Bayerische Bahnhof) was built on the southern side of the existing Werrabahn station. Its construction entailed major topographical alterations and changes to the way traffic operations were conducted in the area of the town. The 64 kilometre long route was opened on 15 December 1874 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways, the operator of the line. Following the completion of the railway from Ritschenhausen to Neudietendorf in 1884, express trains ran over the line from Berlin via Meiningen to Stuttgart. This required locomotives to be exchanged as the train crossed over from the jurisdiction of the Prussian to the Bavarian state railways at either Meiningen or Ritschenhausen. Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof After the takeover of the state railways (Länderbahnen) by the Deutsche Reichsbahn the latter ran the route and kept the express services running. After the Second World War the line was cut between Rentwertshausen and Mühlfeld due to the partition of Germany. From then on the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) in East Germany only operated the Meiningen–Rentwertshausen–Römhild section. Railway services on branch from Rentwertshausen to Römhild, opened in 1893, were withdrawn in 1972 again. The Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) initially continued to work the line to Mühlfeld, but from 1971 only as far as Mellrichstadt. Express trains from Munich called here until the early 1980s. After the reunification of Germany in 1990 the DB and DR soon closed the gaps in the line again and it was ceremonially reopened in 1991. For a short while long-distance traffic came to life again in the shape of the Interregio train, the Rennsteig, but in 2001 it was replaced by a Regionalexpress.  Operation  The Lower Franconia Shuttle at Meiningen station Since 2004 rail services on the line between Schweinfurt and Meiningen have been operated by the Erfurter Bahn (EB) whose Lower Franconia Shuttle (Unterfranken-Shuttle), line EB 4, runs every two hours between Schweinfurt and Mellrichstadt from Monday to Friday and, on Saturday am and Sunday pm, almost hourly. In addition DB Regionalexpress trains run every two hours from Erfurt to Schweinfurt (RE 7) (on this section from Ritschenhausen). Since 2008 the DB has used tilting trains which attain speeds of up to 160 km/h. The Erfurter Bahn also operates the EB 5 Regionalbahn route (the Franconian Saale Valley railway or Fränkische Saaletalbahn) using the Unterfranken-Shuttle on the Schweinfurth–Eberhausen line and running it through to Bad Kissingen and Gemünden am Main. The „Unterfranken-Shuttle“ also calls at Schweinfurt-Mitte and Schweinfurt-Stadt via Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof. The DB uses Class 612 DMUs exclusively whilst the Erfurter Bahn operates Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 multiples.

Background Although Thomas Hood (1799–1845) is usually regarded as a humorous poet, towards the end of his life, when he was on his sick bed, he wrote a number of poems commenting on contemporary poverty. These included \\"The Song of the Shirt\\", \\"The Bridge of Sighs\\" and \\"The Song of the Labourer\\". \\"The Bridge of Sighs\\" is particularly well-known because of its novel meter, complex three syllable rhymes, varied rhyming scheme and pathetic subject matter. The poem describes the woman as having been immersed in the grimy water, but having been washed so that whatever sins she may have committed are obliterated by the pathos of her death. She seems to have committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, after she was thrown out of her home. Make no deep scrutiny Into her mutiny Rash and undutiful: Past all dishonour, Death has left on her Only the beautiful. Several clues in the poem, which harps upon beauty, sins and scorn, hint that the woman was pregnant and had been thrown out of her home. Sisterly, brotherly, Fatherly, motherly Feelings had changed: Love, by harsh evidence, Thrown from its eminence; Even God's providence Seeming estranged. Illustrations The poem was widely anthologised and frequently illustrated in books of Victorian poetry, including an etching by Sir John Everett Millais in 1858. It was also set to music by Reinhold Ludwig Herman (1849–1919). Along with Hood's other notable serious poem, The Song of the Shirt, it influenced several Victorian artists. Paintings inspired by the poem included Augustus Egg's Past and Present (1858; Tate, London), Abraham Solomon's untraced Drowned! Drowned! and G.F. Watts's Found Drowned (Watts Gallery, Compton, Surrey).Barbara T. Gates, Victorian Suicide, Chapter Seven: Suicidal Women: Fact Or Fiction?

He has worked extensively as a criminal defence lawyer from the 1990s. As of April, 2019 he practices as part of the association of Rotenberg Shidlowski Jesin. Rotenberg's first novel, Old City Hall is an international best-seller. He has written four additional legal thriller novels. Early life and education Robert Rotenberg was born and raised in Toronto, with three brothers (Lawrence, David, and Matthew) sons of Jewish parents Dr. Cyril Rotenberg, a physician, and his mother Gertrude Ruth (Gertie) Rotenberg, described as a \\"woman of initiative, of new ideas and steady values.\\" Rotenberg studied at the University of Toronto, Osgoode Hall and the London School of Economics. Older brother David Rotenberg also attended the University of Toronto and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. He left Toronto in 1971, eventually making a name for himself first as a theatre director in the United States, and, after he returned to Toronto in 1987, very well respected acting teacher and best-selling novelist in his own right, returning to Toronto in 1987.  Career  While in Europe in the early 1980s, he was the managing editor of English-language magazine Passion, The Magazine of Paris. When he returned to Canada, he and a partner founded and published T.O. The Magazine of Toronto, which ran for six years and folded in 1988 . After brief stints as a film executive and a CBC Radio producer, Rotenberg returned to law. He and associates Alvin Shidlowski and Jacob Jesin have had a criminal law practice in Toronto since the early 1990s defending, as Rotenberg describes it, \\"everything from murder to shoplifting.\\" Cases attracting particular attention have included the defence in 2007 of an Ontario College of Art and Design student who planted a fake bomb and posted a YouTube video about it as part of an art project, which in turn prompted an evacuation during a gala fundraiser at the Royal Ontario Museum. Rotenberg continues to actively practice law while focusing on his writing career, saying he plans to write 20 legal thrillers set in Toronto.  Writing  Rotenberg's first novel, Old City Hall, is set in Toronto, and as the name suggests, features pivotal scenes in the city's historic Old City Hall, now used as a courthouse. The book was published in February–March 2009 in North America and the United Kingdom, and audio and translated international versions have been published in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Poland, Japan and Israel. Critical reviews of the novel were mixed to positive. Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"Both plot and prose are ordinary, but the atmospherics, and especially Rotenberg’s affection for the city of Toronto and the involutions of the law, make this a fast-paced, appealing addition to the [legal thriller] genre.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-rotenberg/old-city- hall/ In Publishers Weekly, Sara Crichton declared that the courtroom scenes were the highlights of Old City Hall, while \\"too many underdeveloped characters and unnecessary subplots may leave some readers feeling the eventual trial wasn't worth the wait.\\" Since then he has published The Guilty Plea in 2011, Stray Bullets in 2012 and Stranglehold in 2013, \\"Heart of the City\\" in 2018. All of his books have been on the Globe & Mail bestseller. All are set in Toronto, and feature the same ensemble cast. In 2013 NPR broadcast a feature story about Rotenberg and Toronto for their \\"Crime in the City\\" series, describing how he develops his characters by giving them actual locations in Toronto to live. Rotenberg also teaches part-time at the Humber Writing School correspondence course and does writing seminars at various law firms in Toronto as well as lecturing at an LLM program at Osgoode Hall Law School. He is an avid presenter of his work and enjoys meeting readers and writers at live reading events. He has participated in The Word on the Street, Authors at Harbourfront Centre, Toronto and the Ottawa International Writers Festival, Thrillerfest in New York City, among other literary events.

After five years of operation, it was taken over by a man named Lynch who moved it to a site on what would be named College Street. This Academy closed in 1845 due to a lack of funding. Second academy In 1849, Barnabus F. Lee opened his proprietary Lee's Girls Academy on College Street, and the Presbyterians opened a new Academy for boys. Lee's Girls Academy incorporated in 1854 as the Poland Female College and moved into a larger building. In 1855, the Boy's Academy building burnt down and was never rebuilt, while the Female College moved into a new three-story brick structure elsewhere on College Street.

The Presbytery of Mahoning now took control of the school, operating it under the name Poland Seminary School or Poland Union Seminary as a Christian school teaching at a high school and junior college level. A dormitory for boys from out of town was built, but female students had to room and board in nearby private housing. From 1881-1883, Ida Tarbell was the preceptress or head teacher there. Decline In 1895, portions of the aging school building collapsed; the remainder was demolished, and a building built on the foundation. The seminary continued to struggle, and on June 21, 1909, the facility was sold to Poland's city school district under the condition that the high school retain the name of Poland Seminary. That school is Poland Seminary High School. Notable alumni and faculty *A. E.

He joined the Scarborough Police Department the next year, rising to the rank of Deputy Chief. In 1953, he came to public attention when, as a police inspector, he investigated the disappearance of Scarborough teenager Marion McDowell, organizing what was then the largest manhunt in Toronto history for the missing girl. The case was never solved. By 1956, the Scarborough Police Department was amalgamated with other Toronto- area police forces to become the Metropolitan Toronto Police in 1957. In 1970 he became the new force's third chief with the retirement of James Page Mackey. The police force in the 1970s had to cope with a growing population, rising crime rate, and declining respect for authority. The Toronto Police faced public anger and charges of racism following the fatal shooting of Albert Johnson by a police officer in 1979. A royal commission under Justice Donald Morand investigated the police during his tenure and found acts of police brutality and police officers giving false testimony under oath. Mel Lastman, mayor of the Metropolitan Toronto borough of North York in the 1970s, said that Adamson responded to complaints of \\"outlawed displays of bigotry on the force, instituted new procedures following the Morand report into allegations of police brutality and commissioned the Hickling Johnson Report on adapting to the future.\\" Adamson also pushed to recruit more minorities, and oversaw changes such as improving officer training, and expanding work among youth in crime prevention.

Their three daughter were Yocheved, Miriam and Rachel (11th - 12th century). They each married their father's finest students and were the mothers of the leaders of the next generation of French Talmudic scholars. Almost every Ashkenazi rabbinic dynasty traces its ancestry back to either Yocheved or Miriam, and the majority of the tosafists, were recent descendants of Rashi's daughters. All born in Troyes, France, their descendants inhabited Germany, France, and Italy in the early 11th to 15th centuries, with the majority later moving to Eastern Europe, where they established several notable rabbinic dynasties. Yocheved and family Yocheved bat Shlomo Yitzchaki (Hebrew: יוכבד בת שלמה יצחקי) was born between 1058 and 1062 in Troyes, and died in 1135 in Ramerupt. She married Meir ben Samuel, son of Samuel of Vives and Miriam. He was born around 1060 in Ramerupt, where he died in 1135, a few months after her. They had four sons: Isaac ben Meir, Samuel ben Meir, Solomon ben Meir, and Jacob ben Meir. Despite the modern Ashkenazi naming custom, Yocheved's son Solomon was born during her father's lifetime. Yocheved and Meir had at least two daughters who married Rashi's students: Hannah, a teacher of laws and customs relevant to women, married Samuel ben Simcha. Their son, Isaac of Dampierre, became the leading Talmudic scholar of his generation. Another daughter, whose name is unknown, married Samson ben Joseph. Yocheved's name appears in MS de Rossi 181. Miriam and family Miriam bat Shlomo Yitzchaki (Hebrew: מרים בת שלמה יצחקי) was born between 1058 and 1062 and died after 1090. She married Judah ben Nathan son of Nathan of Paris and Alvina. He was born around 1065 in Mainz and died around 1105 in Paris. They had a one known daughter, Alvina, a learned woman whose customs served as an example for other Jewish women. They also had three sons: Yom Tov ben Judah, Samson ben Judah and Eliezer ben Judah. Yom Tov later moved to Paris and headed a yeshiva there, along with his brothers.  Rachel and another daughter  Rachel bat Shlomo Yitzchaki (Hebrew: רחל בת שלמה יצחקי) was born in Troyes around 1070. She married Rabbi Eliezer. They had no children. Almost nothing is known about Rachel except for a letter that Rabbenu Tam wrote to his cousin, Yom Tov, in which he mentioned that their aunt Rachel was divorced from her husband, Eliezer. One of Rashi's responsa discusses the case of his young daughter losing a valuable ring at a time when Yocheved and Miriam were adults, so there was clearly another daughter much younger than her older sisters. In addition, Rashi is mentioned as having a grandson, Shemiah, and a granddaughter, Miriam, whose mother was neither Yocheved nor Miriam. Judy Chicago, in her compendium of significant women in history, lists Rachel (b. 1070), daughter of Rashi, as a learned woman who acted as his secretary and took his dictation when he was infirm. Some scholars, based on a responsum that details how Rashi mourned for a little girl during a Jewish festival even though such mourning is prohibited, have postulated that he was mourning the death of his own young daughter, who would have been younger than Rachel.  Rashi's family circle  * Rashi ** Yocheved bat Rashi & Meir ben Samuel *** Isaac ben Meir *** Samuel ben Meir *** Solomon ben Meir *** Jacob ben Meir **** Margolioth family *** Hannah bat Meir & Samuel ben Simhah of Vitry **** Isaac ben Samuel ***** Elhanan ben Isaac of Dampierre ****** Samuel ben Elhanan Jaffe ******* Jaffe family ** Miriam bat Rashi *** Yom Tov ben Judah **** Judah ben Yom Tov ***** Isaac ben Judah ****** Judah ben Isaac Messer Leon ****** daughter of Isaac ben Judah & Yechiel of Paris ******* Moses ben Yechiel ******** Joseph ben Moses ********* Matityahu ben Joseph ********** Abraham ben Matityahu *********** Lurie family and Treves family ** Rachel bat Rashi & Eliezer  Legends  There are a couple of legends about Rashi's daughters, all suggesting that they possessed unusual piety and scholarship. The best-known, and most likely to be true, states that they were learned in Torah and Talmud at a time when women were forbidden to study Talmud. While it seems impossible for girls with a yeshiva in their home to grow up without knowledge of Torah, there is more evidence than this. A responsum of Rashi notes that he is too weak to write so he is dictating to his daughter, which indicates that she was capable of understanding and writing complicated legal issues in Hebrew. There are two versions of this responsa, the other stating that Rashi was dictating to the \\"son of my daughter\\" instead of just \\"my daughter.\\" However, it seems unlikely that Rashi would use the awkward expression, \\"son of my daughter\\" instead of, \\"my grandson,\\" and more likely that \\"son of\\" was added in later. There is also evidence that Rashi's daughters and granddaughters taught Torah to local women and served as models for the proper performance of Jewish rituals. While there is no evidence that Rashi's daughters themselves wore tefillin, it is known that some women in medieval France and Germany did, and that Rabbenu Tam, Rashi's grandson, ruled that a woman doing any mitzvah that she is not obligated to, including tefillin, must make the appropriate blessing.

He founded his versified newspaper, published in Danish with the title Den Danske Mercurius. The newspaper was published on the order of the Sovereign. Its publishing was a turning point in the history of Danish journalism. It was published on a monthly basis with two quarto pages. It contained domestic and international news written in Alexandrine verse style, accompanied by reasoning in the form of small poems. Regarding the messages from Denmark itself, news from the Royal Danish court took up the most space, but many other news topics were mentioned too, e.g. the arrival of foreign diplomats, appointments, meteorological phenomena and fires. The name of the newspaper, Mercurius, referred to the messenger of the gods in Greek and Roman mythology, and had already been used for foreign newspapers, (e.g. the Mercure Francais from 1605), but in its form the Danish newspaper was an imitation of the versed La muze historique, which Jean Loret wrote for mademoiselle de Longueville, later the Duchess of Nemours, from 1650. Den Danske Mercurius continued its published for 14 years after the 1677 death of its founder, Bording, but its quality was diminished due to the lack of his founder's talent.

He was an associate of Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, better known as \\"Carlos the Jackal\\". He disappeared in 1995. CareerIsraeli mission= In 1970 Bréguet, then 19 years old, traveled to Lebanon to join the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). A few weeks later, he was arrested on 23 June 1970 in Israel, while carrying two kilograms of explosives with the purpose of dynamiting harbour installations in Haifa. His friend François Genoud asked his son-in-law, lawyer Maurice Cruchon, to defend Bréguet. Bréguet, who denied any ties with the PFLP, was sentenced in 1971 to 15 years imprisonment, but was pardoned in 1977 as a result of public advocacy by an international committee of supporters that included Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Noam Chomsky and Alberto Moravia—as well as Genoud. He was expelled from Israel on 24 July 1977. In the late 1970s, Bréguet may have established links with militants of Prima Linea. He wrote an account of his captivity in Israel that was published in 1980 in Milan under the title La scuola dell'odio (The School of Hate). =Radio Free Europe bombing= Richard Cummings writes that Bréguet joined Carlos' group in 1980 and took part in its 1981 bombing of Radio Free Europe headquarters in Munich as his first operation. In August 1996 German prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Bréguet in connection with that attack. =French missions= In February 1982 Bréguet and Carlos' wife Magdalena Kopp (fresh from a failed 18 January 1982 mission to destroy the Superphénix nuclear power plant in France) were arrested in an underground parking garage in Paris. They were carrying in the trunk of their vehicle two bottles of gas, two kilos of explosives linked to a timer set to go off at ten-thirty, and two grenades. During the arrest, Bréguet attempted to kill the police with a gun that misfired. Bréguet and Kopp denied they were on a terrorist mission. François Genoud asked his friend, lawyer Jacques Vergès, to defend them in court. Carlos' organization also set off several bombs in retaliation for the arrest, and Carlos then wrote to French interior minister Gaston Defferre demanding their release. When the letter was leaked to the press, the publicity ended in the pair getting lighter prison sentences with the attempted murder charge dropped. It was later said that Bréguet and Kopp had been hired to bomb the Paris office of the magazine Al Watan al Arabi at 33 Rue Marbeuf, which was eventually hit on 22 April 1982.Holy war. Wilhelm Dietl. Macmillan, 1984. , . p. 150 Bréguet and Kopp were both paroled in 1985Follain 186 and rejoined Carlos in Damascus, Syria. Later, Bréguet set down with family in Greece. Disappearance Bréguet was last seen on 12 November 1995 on board the ferry Lato sailing from Italy to Greece. Searches by Greek police and Interpol revealed nothing. There are various theories and rumours regarding his disappearance. Some have speculated that he was killed by former associates, that he went into hiding because of evidence against him in recently released Stasi files, or that he cooperated with authorities and has since been living under a new identity. His family has charged that he was kidnapped by the Greek or French secret service. It has been said in late 1996 that he may have been captured by the French DGSE to be confronted with witnesses and documents, concerning the implication of high regional officials of Nice in arms traffic to Algeria. Breguet reportedly cooperated with French intelligence and justice. Bréguet is also believed to have been murdered as a body who was found in Greece might have been his, but the authorities have not proved this be true. In 2009, Carlos wrote to newly elected US President Barack Obama alleging that Bréguet had been kidnapped by \\"CIA agents backed by Nato naval commandos\\" and asking for information on his current whereabouts.

The matter later came to be known as the \\"Grafton Affair\\". When Finland had become a grand duchy in the Russian empire in 1809, Finland was allowed to keep its own laws, language and religion. In the end of the 19th century this position was threatened, as russification policies were suggested and attempted. The Russification campaign resulted in resistance of which the arms smuggling by John Grafton was a part. Eventually no military action resulted at the time, though Finland did eventually declare independence on 6 December 1917 following the October Revolution in Russia. John Grafton was a 315-ton ship built in 1883. It was bought by Japanese army officer and intelligence agent Akashi Motojiro in 1905 to aid an armed uprising in Finland. This was done nominally in the name of a sympathetic London wine merchant. The ship sailed to Flushing and on 28 July and the ship was renamed the Luna. The wine merchant sold the ship to a non British firm on this day, but did not report it. However, a subsequent inquiry conducted by the Maritime Department of the Board of Trade in September was able to retrospectively remove the ship from the English register of shipping, avoiding embarrassment when its subsequent activities came to the attention of the Russian authorities. After the Russification in Finland increased, the resistance activist Konni Zilliacus in 1905 organized the smuggling of weapons to the Finnish and the Russian resistance movements. With Japanese financing, John Grafton was bought. In London the ship was loaded with 15,500 Swiss Vetterli rifles, 2.5 million bullets, 2,500 high-class English officer's revolvers and 3 tons of explosives. According to the original plan, the weapons were to be transported via the Netherlands and Copenhagen to a meeting place in the Gulf of Finland, from where the journey would continue to St Petersburg. On arrival, a part of the cargo would be offloaded and given to Russian revolutionaries. After running into a few problems the route was changed, and the ship set course towards the Gulf of Bothnia and the town of Kemi, where part of the cargo was offloaded. The journey continued to Jakobstad which, like Kemi, was a centre of the Finnish resistance. The ship was piloted into the rocky archipelago north of Jakobstad and the offloading of the weapons was conducted without any serious problems. When the ship continued her journey south, she ran aground. The crew started to salvage what remained of the weapons. It quickly became clear that the whole cargo could not be salvaged. The captain, J.W. Nylander, made the decision to blow up the ship to avoid it ending up in the hands of the Russian authorities. On the afternoon of 8 September 1905 the ship was blown up with three powerful charges. The sound of the explosion was heard some 50 kilometers away. Despite the harsh censorship during the Russification, widespread speculation about the event occurred in both Finnish and foreign newspapers. Even though the plans for John Grafton did not pan out, the event is considered one of the first concrete actions for an independent Finland. In 1930 a monument was unveiled at Orrskär in Larsmo to commemorate the event. To this day parts of the cargo and ship lie at the bottom of the gulf. The weapons that had been offloaded started to spread out into the villages (where they amongst other things were used for moose hunting) and were later part of the armory of the White Guard when it founded in 1917. The already obsolete weapons (the Vetterli M 1869 was a black powder rifle) were never used in any military manner. The Russian authorities salvaged parts of the cargo and sunk them further out where the depth was greater.

It can be constructed in Canada as a basic ultra-light, an advanced ultra-light or amateur-built aircraft. Development The EZ Flyer was the first aircraft design of Wayne Winters of Indus, Alberta. In 1991 Winters set out to design a high performance kit plane that he intended to produce commercially. While considering the design parameters of that proposed aircraft he saw a picture of a Breezy homebuilt and decided instead to design a smaller and lighter aircraft inspired by the Breezy instead. Winter's own past experience flying Ultraflight Lazairs provided the motivation for the design of a slow, easy to handle aircraft with an open cockpit. Winters designed a new open lattice, \\"N\\" girder fuselage constructed from 4130 steel tube along with a new tail to be fitted with wings from the Merlin EZ. The aircraft retained the Junker's ailerons of the Merlin along with the Clark \\"Y\\" airfoil that produces docile handling characteristics. The wing also features the Merlin's leading edge \\"D\\" cell construction, with foam ribs. The prototype has two seats in tandem and is powered by a Rotax 503 two stroke engine of . The first prototype of the new design flew in October 1991 and was initially unnamed. Winters allowed several pilots to fly the new design and all remarked on its docile handling, its suitability as a trainer and the ease with which pilots mastered it. As a result, Winters initially named it Easy Flyer and later EZ Flyer (pronounced in the American way as \\"Eezee Flier\\"). The EZ Flyer can be equipped with a variety of powerplants, all mounted in pusher configuration: *Rotax 503 *Rotax 582 *Rotax 912 *Rotax 912S Operational history The prototype proved robust and easy for students to learn to fly on and has been used since new as a trainer at the Blue Yonder Ultralight Flight School.

These operators pay a fee as well as a percentage of profit generated to the state. It is regarded as a form of intrapreneurship. History The Chengbao system was first introduced during the land reform in China. In order to get around Maoist-era laws prohibiting land ownership, land was \\"chéng bāo\\" or contracted to the public, such as to individual peasants by the state. The system was quickly expanded to include many other assets. Today in China, many public assets and public service companies such as hospitals, schools and even auto companies are contracted out to private operators who operate it with a profit motive in mind but return operating expenses and profit to the government. This has the advantage of creating extra value to the contractor, generates funding for the state and public, and improves services for the consumer. Recently, \\"Chengbao\\" or contracting services has also been expanded to the private sector, where large privately owned enterprises allow individuals who aren't employees of the firm operate their assets.

In 1977, during the transition, an eighth law with the same status as the others was brought into effect, altering the legislative framework in order to bring to a head the process of political reform. Rather than a typical constitution, the laws were ', a distinctly Spanish legal concept dating to medieval times with a wide range of meanings, as they had not been developed or approved by elected representatives. The Fundamental Laws were ultimately revoked by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. The eight laws were: :1. The of 1938: Influenced by the Italian Labour Charter of 1927, it regulated the labour conditions and economic life of Spain. Though it established a minimum wage and limits on the length of the working day, these concessions were subordinate to the national interest. :2. The of 1942: Created with an eye to a coming Allied victory in World War II. It recreated the Cortes as a limited instrument of collaboration, for creating and promulgating new laws. The first Cortes of Francoist Spain was inaugurated on July 18, 1942. :3. The of 1945: Fixed the rights and duties of the Spanish people. One intent was to convey an impression of formal democratisation to the Potsdam Conference. :4. The of 1945: Established the use of referendums to settle important points. The Law of Succession made it obligatory to hold a referendum to change the fundamental laws. :5. The Law of Succession to the Headship of the State of 1947: Regulated the Succession; the monarchy of Spain was de jure restored. Franco would remain head of state for life. Created the Council of the Realm and the Council of the Regency. The law was approved by a referendum on 6 July 1947. :6. The of 1958: Established some organising principles for the judiciary of Franco's Spain, and enshrined into law the principles of Francoism per se. :7. The Organic Law of the State of 1967: Enumerated the ends of the state and fixed the powers and duties of the Head of State, as well as creating formally the office of Chief of Government. The law was approved by a referendum on 14 December 1966. :8. The Law for Political Reform of 1977: Political reform was begun in 1976. This law established the minimum conditions for the election of a new Cortes by universal suffrage, and authorised it to carry out the constitutional reforms of the transition. The law was approved by a referendum on 15 December 1976. Thus, in the State's time of rupture, the existing legal structures were used to create a parliamentary monarchy.

Sturgeon subsequently presented an early weekend morning programme for BBC Radio 2 in 1992/93, but returned to Radio Kent subsequently, where she presented a lunchtime current affairs show until leaving the station in 2004. Career Sturgeon's broadcasting career began in 1983 when she joined BBC Radio Medway (later BBC Radio Kent) and presented reports for the BBC from Northern Ireland during the height of the Troubles, and a Teabreak feature. She went on from this to front the Drivetime show for BBC Radio Kent, as well as a Sunday request show, before presenting her own lunchtime current affairs show, The Barbara Sturgeon Show. The programme covered a broad range of topics, from political and social issues to more light-hearted subjects, as well as human interest stories. Among topics covered on the show were a debate on the Zeebrugge Inquiry, held following the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster. Sturgeon also hosted election coverage for the station. The lunchtime show garnered Sturgeon the Sony Local Radio Personality of the Year Award in both 1987 and 1988. She was again nominated for the Award in 1989 for a programme which featured live coverage of a human birth. Following the success of her lunchtime show, she later presented BBC Radio Kent's News and Current Affairs Breakfast Show, before moving to BBC Radio 2 in 1992, where she spent two years presenting an early breakfast show on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Sturgeon returned to BBC Radio Kent in the 1990s to present another lunchtime show, which had a similar format to her original programme.

It is on the east side of Kingsway in East Didsbury, close to Manchester's boundary with Stockport. It was built as part of Phase 3b of the network's expansion and opened on 23 May 2013. History East Didsbury tram stop was built on the Midland Railway's former Manchester South District line from Manchester Central Station. East Didsbury Metrolink station is northeast of East Didsbury railway station, which is a heavy National Rail station on the Styal Line. Together with West Didsbury and Didsbury Village Metrolink stops, East Didsbury had been a feature of proposals to extend the Metrolink system since 1983. In 2006, it was announced that the CLC line would be re-opened as part of an expansion project, and that the extension would initially go only as far as St Werburgh's Road in a project named Phase 3a. Following the rejection of the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund in a public referendum in 2008, Phase 3b of the extension of the line to East Didsbury went ahead using the Greater Manchester Transport Fund. Construction of the line through Chorlton began in April 2009 and that part of the new line became operational in July 2011. The extension to East Didsbury opened on 23 May 2013. Passengers could now travel on the old rail alignment into Manchester for the first time since 1967. Although the station is currently the terminus of the South Manchester Line, the line could be extended to Stockport, a proposal which was originally submitted in 2001, but was cancelled due to poor funding.

June 26, 1950, he recorded the American version of the song (English lyrics by Jerry Seelen) in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra. When it was released, the disc was a worldwide success and the song was then performed by the greatest international singers. The festival was called Grande Parade du Jazz from 1974 to 1993. Over the years, many artists, such as Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Helen Humes, Herbie Hancock, and Miles Davis, regularly appeared at the festival. After 1994, it saw a change of emphasis, with more world music and pop. But the festival's newest organizer, Vivian Sicnasi, has reinstated an eclectic mix of traditional and modern sounds with an international line-up; it remains \\"one of the Riviera's biggest annual events.\\" Set in the vast Jardins de Cimiez (which contains a Roman amphitheatre), the event features several separate stages where groups perform simultaneously each evening, for eight days in July. In 2011, following years of falling attendance, the festival was moved from Cimiez to the more centrally located Place Masséna. It was reported that about 30,000 spectators attended the five-day festival in 2011. The 2012 festival took place from July 8–12 and performers included Herbie Hancock, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Erykah Badu, Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings, Gregory Porter and the Jimi Brown Experience.

He was nicknamed \\"Mr. International Navy\\" as one of the very few senior admirals in the U.S. Navy identified with international naval cooperation during the Cold War. Early career Born in Brownsville, Pennsylvania to Charles F. Colbert, Jr., president of the Pittsburgh Metallurgical Company, and the former Marie Louise Benford, he attended Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before being appointed to the United States Naval Academy by Congressman Harry A. Estep in 1933. He graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1937 as one of the four midshipmen officers appointed to command a battalion of the Naval Academy regiment for that academic year, with a class rank of 247/331. =World War II= USS Meade (DD-602) Commissioned ensign, he served aboard the aircraft carrier from its commissioning on September 30, 1937, until 1939, when he was assigned to the destroyer Barker in the Asiatic Fleet. He remained aboard Barker for the next five years, rising from junior ensign to lieutenant commander and commanding officer. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Barker operated with the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) in Southeast Asian and Australian waters until May 1942, then escorted convoys between San Francisco, California, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii until May 1943, when the destroyer transferred to the Atlantic Fleet to join Task Group 21.12, a hunter-killer group centered on the escort carrier Core. In 1944, he assumed command of the destroyer Meade, operating with the Pacific Fleet. After the war, Meade was sent on a relief sweep along Tonkin Gulf coastal areas to assist French forces in combating Chinese pirates off Haiphong. Promoted to commander, Colbert spent the next two and a half years as personnel planning officer in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, where he helped plan the postwar naval reserve and served as a social aide in the White House. =Postwar= In June 1948 he was sent to London as aide and flag secretary to Admiral Richard L. Conolly, Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (CINCNELM). A superb negotiator, Conolly left a deep impression on Colbert, whose later work on international naval cooperation would be founded on the lessons he learned by watching Conolly interact with allied naval leaders. When Conolly's tour as CINCNELM ended in December 1950, Colbert briefly accompanied Conolly to the admiral's new posting as president of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Colbert's next assignment was in the Politico-Military Affairs Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OP-35), where he helped establish the naval commands in the newly created NATO alliance and quickly developed a reputation for familiarity with allied problems and ability to deal with foreign governments. In 1951, Chief of Naval Operations Forrest P. Sherman selected Colbert to be his aide later in the year, in the meantime tapping Colbert for temporary duty as Sherman's special assistant during overseas trips. In July 1951, Colbert accompanied Sherman to Spain to negotiate naval basing with General Francisco Franco. Shortly after the meeting, Sherman suddenly died of a heart attack. With no written record of Sherman's conversations with Franco, it fell to Colbert to debrief the late admiral's negotiations to the Navy Department and other government agencies. From 1953 to 1955, Colbert was executive officer of the heavy cruiser Albany, which served as flagship for Commander, Battleship-Cruiser Force, Atlantic, and was deployed to the Mediterranean. Vice Admiral Robert H. Rice, his former commanding officer, remembered Colbert as \\"the best executive officer any ship had had (or the good fortune to have).\\" Promoted to captain in 1955, Colbert was offered a choice between assignment as head of an academic section at the Naval Academy or as a student at the Naval War College. On Conolly's advice, Colbert opted for the Naval War College and was enrolled in the naval warfare 1 course. By January 1956 he had been selected to remain for a second academic year as a student in the naval warfare 2 course, but was reassigned that spring to become the first director of a new Naval War College course for international naval officers. =Naval command course= Students and staff of the first naval command course, September 8, 1956. Colbert is second from right in back row. In the spring of 1956, Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh A. Burke assigned Colbert to organize and direct a new course at the Naval War College for senior naval officers from allied and friendly nations. Said Burke, \\"I had already learned that the CNO could not just give an order and expect to have it carried out. He had to get somebody who was in agreement with the project, who was just as enthusiastic about it, who was capable of running it without supervision, who could get things done, and who could use the authority delegated him wisely to take charge of the project. That man was Dick Colbert.\\" During his tour in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Colbert had worked closely with Burke as one of Burke's action officers when Burke was director of the Plans Division, and Burke remembered Colbert's unusual competence in international relations. Moreover, during that tour Colbert had actually written a brief staff study on the best way to educate foreign naval officers at Navy service schools without compromising either national security or the level of their instruction.Sokolsky, pp. 9-15 Based on that four-year-old study, Colbert spent the summer of 1956 preparing for the arrival of students from up to 30 countries in August. To avoid using the word \\"foreign\\", he selected the title \\"Naval Command Course for Free World Naval Officers.\\" Colbert served as director of the naval command course for its first two classes. Students generally attended the regular Naval War College lectures for the naval warfare 1 course, and took field trips during lectures dealing with classified topics such as nuclear operations. Colbert leveraged his extensive personal contacts to arrange visits to military and naval sites, as well as industrial plants in Buffalo, New York, and the New York Stock Exchange. Colbert and his wife also spent a considerable amount of their own money to organize social events to foster lasting informal ties between students, whose personal bonding was viewed as almost as important as the formal curriculum. Colbert was impressed by the high quality of the inaugural class, writing, \\"The capability of the students is far beyond our expectations--they really look like the 'future CNO's of the Free World' as Admiral Burke describes them.\\" =Major command= After three years at the Naval War College, Colbert was assigned to the Long Range Plans and Basic War Plans Branch of the Joint Staff. In 1960 he became commanding officer of the Sixth Fleet's general stores ship Altair, based in Barcelona, Spain, where he helped pioneer the use of helicopters for vertical replenishment of supplies for ships at sea. USS Boston (CAG-1) Selected for major command, Colbert requested \\"a cruiser out of Boston,\\" which resulted in his being assigned as captain of the guided missile cruiser Boston from October 1961 to February 1963.USS Boston: The Captain's Cabin During his tour, Boston deployed to the Mediterranean and briefly hosted the commander of the Sixth Fleet, Vice Admiral David L. McDonald, who recalled that \\"Colbert and his crew in the Boston went out of their way to make their ship a most outstanding flagship.\\" While commanding Boston, Colbert applied for one of the two military billets on the Policy Planning Council (PPC) of the Department of State, a long-range planning and advisory staff tasked with analyzing major foreign policy problems and coordinating political-military policy and interagency planning. The Navy had never sent an officer to the PPC, and Colbert's detailing officer in the Bureau of Naval Personnel warned him repeatedly that an assignment to the State Department would irreparably damage his career, but Colbert persisted, passing an interview with Director of Policy Planning Walt W. Rostow and recruiting support from Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Paul H. Nitze, a former PPC chairman whose aide Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., \\"pulled the necessary levers.\\" During his time on the PPC, Colbert worked on topics ranging from the Vietnam War, various proposals for multilateral forces, and nuclear weapons arrangements east of the Suez Canal. In May 1964, midway through his two-year tour, he was one of five in his class selected for rear admiral. Indicating its newfound appreciation for the importance of Colbert's work, the Navy had him complete his scheduled term on the PPC instead of immediately transferring him to a traditional flag-level command. For his service on the PPC, he was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal.Sokolsky, pp. 17-21 Flag officer In June 1964 he was assigned as Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 6 (COMCRUDESFLOT SIX), based in Charleston, South Carolina, and assumed command in 1965. With about fifty ships under his command, the position was equivalent to being commander in chief of a small navy. From June 1966 to August 1968 he served as deputy chief of staff and assistant chief of staff for policy, plans and operations to Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT), for which he received the Legion of Merit.Sokolsky, p. 23 His first assignment on the SACLANT staff was to establish Iberian Atlantic Command (IBERLANT), a Portuguese-led command responsible for covering the sea approaches to the Strait of Gibraltar. Said Moorer, \\"This action not only significantly enhanced the capability of NATO to deal with naval operations in the area, but also significantly increased the morale, prestige and overall interest of the Portuguese allies. I give Admiral Colbert all of the credit for this important move.\\" In late November 1966, Colbert prepared a concept paper proposing a permanent SACLANT naval contingency force based on Operation Matchmaker, an annual six-month exercising involving ships from allied navies. The proposed contingency force was approved by NATO in December 1967 and activated in January 1968 as Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT). =President of the Naval War College= As President of the Naval War College (second from left), with superintendents of the Naval Academy and Naval Postgraduate School, 1969. In July 1968, Colbert was unexpectedly selected to be President of the Naval War College and promoted to vice admiral ahead of ten classmates. He replaced Vice Admiral John T. Hayward, who had specifically recommended Colbert as his ideal successor. As a relatively young rear admiral who was expected to rise much further in the Navy after his presidency, Colbert's appointment broke the postwar tradition of selecting an \\"elder statesman\\" on the verge of retirement. A pleased Colbert remarked, \\"It is a dream come true --a dream that I would never have mentioned to anyone, for fear of being precocious.\\" During his presidency, which lasted from August 30, 1968, until August 17, 1971,United States Naval War College: NWC Past Presidents Colbert consolidated his predecessor's curricular reforms and expanded the civilian and military faculty. He also continued the Naval War College building program, working with Rhode Island Senator John O. Pastore to secure congressional funding for new student housing and other construction projects. In collaboration with sculptor Felix de Weldon and National Gallery of Art director J. Carter Brown, he completed the design of three new buildings -- Spruance Hall, Conolly Hall, and Hewitt Hall -- for which he arranged to reopen the old quarry in Medford, Massachusetts, to obtain the same granite that had been used to construct the adjacent buildings, so that the new buildings would eventually weather to the same color. Other lasting contributions included the creation of the Naval War College Foundation; the Naval Staff College, an international program for middle-grade officers; and the International Seapower Symposium, a biennial conference for international flag officers whose first meeting, hosted at the Naval War College in 1969, was attended by chiefs of naval staff and senior officers from 37 navies. =Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe= Grave at Arlington National Cemetery After leaving the Naval War College in June 1971, Colbert spent a year as SACLANT chief of staff before being promoted to full admiral and appointed Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH) in June 1972.Commander in Chief US Allied Forces Southern Europe - Lists of Commanding Officers and Senior Officials of the US Navy As CINCSOUTH, Colbert's principal concern was to reduce the tension between Greece and Turkey. He reconstituted the Naval On-Call Force Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED) using Greek, Turkish, Italian, British, and U.S. ships. He also negotiated a treaty with France, which had withdrawn its armed forces from NATO in 1966, to allow annual naval exercises, culminating in a combined Franco-American naval exercise off the coast of the United States in 1973. Chief of Naval Operations Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr. rated Colbert \\"one of our most outstanding NATO commanders\\" due to the decades-long personal relationships he maintained with the alumni of the naval command course, many of whom had become high-ranking flag officers in their respective navies. Zumwalt dubbed Colbert \\"Mr. International Navy\\" for his reputation as one of the very few senior admirals in the U.S. Navy identified with international naval cooperation. In early 1973 Colbert was diagnosed with cancer and was operated on unsuccessfully. Realizing his illness was terminal, he secured Zumwalt's permission to return to his command and serve as long as he could. \\"I am a realist and know that I am on borrowed time,\\" Colbert wrote his chaplain. \\"I am convinced that the Lord has decided to give me some extra time to do some things in this, my last command, which might better insure a safer world. That is the gist of my prayers. All I ask is just a bit more time to carry on and establish some concepts--multinational NATO forces which will strengthen our Free World against what I am convinced is a desperate threat, despite all the talk of détente.\\" Colbert was succeeded as CINCSOUTH by Admiral Means Johnston, Jr., and retired from the Navy on November 25, 1973. He died at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland on December 2, 1973, at the age of 58, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Italian Admiral Giuseppe Pighini, commander of Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe, eulogized Colbert as \\"a man dedicated to his duty till the last breath of life.\\" In his memoirs, Zumwalt wrote admiringly of Colbert's last days: > He performed magnificently throughout his final months and readily agreed to > return home when it became apparent that the end was approaching. Within a > week from the time he marched proudly off the plane at Andrews Air Force > Base in Washington...and after a final chat at Bethesda Naval Hospital > during which he instructed me carefully on all the things he wanted me to > carry on for him in the NATO command and finally asked me whether or not > there was anything more that he could do to help me, Admiral Richard Colbert > died, loved and mourned.\\" Personal life He married the former Prudence Anne Robertson, daughter of the chairman of The London Express Newspapers Company, on November 15, 1950, in St. Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London, and they had one daughter and three sons. His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, awarded for his service as President of the Naval War College, and a Gold Star denoting a second Distinguished Service Medal, awarded for his service as Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe; the Joint Service Commendation Medal, awarded for his service on the Policy Planning Council of the State Department; and the Legion of Merit, awarded for his service as SACLANT deputy chief of staff. The Admiral Richard G. Colbert Memorial Prize is a cash prize sponsored by the Naval War College Foundation and awarded to the student composing the best essay focusing on a strategic, military, political, economic, legal, or tactical aspect of an appropriate professional topic.

Family and childhood Trần Thị Đang was born to Trần Hưng Đạt, a scholar who then served Hanlin Academy under Nguyễn lords, and his first wife, lady Lê Thị Cầm in 1769 at Võ Xá village of Hương Trà district (later renamed to Văn Xá). A daughter from a reputable family, during the 1774 offensive she was chosen as maidservant to Queen Mother Ý Tĩnh - mother of lord Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (later Emperor Gia Long) - who sought asylum in Cửa Tùng. One year later, her father and uncle was seized by Trịnh lord’s army in Quảng Nam. Despite having escaped, they were unable to come back to the South, thus presumed dead for nearly 18 years. Wife of Gia Long In 1779, Đang went South to Gia Định along with Nguyễn Ánh’s sisters following Queen Mother Ý Tĩnh. She became the lord’s concubine (左宮嬪; lit. Concubine of the Left) two years later at the age of 14 and was then commonly called by the title of Nhị phi (二妃; lit. Second wife). Legend has it that one night in 1788, after Nguyễn Ánh had conquered Gia Định, she dreamt of a deity giving her one brilliant red imperial seal and two common ones. The dream was later regarded by posterity as prophetic and the seals represented her three children, with the imperial seal being her first-born who would ascend to the throne years afterwards. Đang stood by Nguyễn Ánh during the time he was fighting Tây Sơn and went on to have three sons with the Emperor: Nguyễn Phúc Đảm (1791 - 1840; later Emperor Minh Mạng), Nguyễn Phúc Đài (1795 - 1849) and Nguyễn Phúc Chẩn (1803 - 1824). Later life and death As Minh Mạng took the throne after Gia Long's death, Đang became Empress Mother. Following her grandson Thiệu Trị's accession, Đang was elevated to the title Grand Empress Mother Nhân Tuyên Từ Khánh Thượng Thọ in 1841. She died in 1846, aged 77, her tomb lies on the right of Gia Long's Lăng Thiên Thọ. She received the title of Empress posthumously.

It is known from a single species, Arganasuchus dutuiti. Fossils of this genus have been found in Upper Triassic rocks of the Argana Basin, Morocco. Though its remains were initially referred to Ticinosuchus when discovered during the 1970s, in 2007 it was identified as a distinct genus with unique features of the pubis and maxilla. Arganasuchus also had several anatomical details in common with Batrachotomus, Fasolasuchus, and Postosuchus, though its relations with other loricatans remains unresolved. Arganasuchus is considered a carnivore due to its large, knife-shaped teeth.  Discovery  Fossils of Arganasuchus were first reported by Jean-Michel Dutuit in 1979, who referred a maxilla, dentary, femur, and fibula to Ticinosuchus. These fossils were found in the lower part of unit T5 (the Irohalene Member) of the Timezgadiouine Formation. This geological formation, which is found in the Argana Basin of Morocco, may have been deposited in the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic period. Arganasuchus dutuiti was named and described in 2007 by Nour-Eddine Jalil and Karin Peyer. Its name translates to \\"Dutuit's Argana crocodile\\" in honor of its discoverer and place of discovery. The genus was based on the holotype AZA 904, a partial pubis bone found at a fossil site near the village of Azarifen. Other Arganasuchus fossils from Azarifen include ribs and a chevron (AZA 903-1-3, and 407-1-5), teeth (AZA 408-1-3), a femur (AZA 900), a fibula (AZA 901), part of a cervical vertebra (AZA 902), part of a neural arch (AZA 905), and part of a tibia (AZA 906). Skull bones have been found at a different locale, the Alili n’yifis site near the village of Alma. These skull bones include a maxilla (ALM 1), and several lower jaws (ALM 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7). One of the jaws, ALM 2, connected to a small angled bone tentatively identified as a quadratojugal. The referral of the skull fossils to Arganasuchus is uncertain but likely considering their \\"rauisuchian\\" identity and similar size and occurrence.  Description  Skull = The maxilla has a straight lower edge with at least 12 large, knife-like teeth set in deep sockets and covered by interdental plates. A longitudinal ridge runs along the inner portion of the maxilla and is continuous with a low facet for the palatine bone. This continuity is seemingly unique to Arganasuchus. The maxilla as a whole is Y-shaped like Batrachotomus and Fasolasuchus. It has a long and tapering posterior process (rear branch) and a shorter ascending process (upper branch) separated by a triangular antorbital fenestra which forms a 40 degrees angle. The maxilla also has an unusually long anterior process (forward branch), forming the \\"stem\\" of the Y shape. It is uncertain whether the front edge of the maxilla formed part of the naris (like Batrachotomus) or contacted the premaxilla (like other loricatans). The possible quadratojugal fossil is thick and sharply angled, apparently contacting a long jugal but not the quadrate, unlike its relatives. The front of the lower jaw is narrow and taper towards the chin, resembling that of Saurosuchus in most respects. Although the rear of the lower jaw is unknown, enough of the front half was preserved to indicate that at least 14 teeth were present. Arganasuchus has an alternating tooth replacement scheme, like many other archosaurs. = Postcrania = The single known vertebra is a spool- shaped cervical (neck) centrum with a low keel running along its underside. A partial neural arch is also preserved, though the low inclination of the postzygapophyses indicates that it may belong to a dorsal (back) vertebra. The rib is similar to those of Saurosuchus (thick, two-headed, with a longitudinal ridge) while the chevron is similar to those of Ticinosuchus (thickened at its tip). The pubis is among the most unusual and unique bones in Arganasuchus. The acetabulum (hip socket) expands down the shaft of the pubis and is delineated from the front by a thick ridge which projects out as a tuberosity at its lower extent. The size and orientation of the acetabulum on the pubis is an autapomorphy (unique defining feature) of Arganasuchus. The femur is large and robust, with a prominent knob-like fourth trochanter overlooking a smaller knob which may be an area of diseased bone. The tibia is thick but incomplete while the fibula is thinner and has a pronounced iliofibularis muscle scar almost halfway down its shaft.  Classification  Arganasuchus is universally considered a \\"rauisuchian\\", a grouping of large carnivorous pseudosuchians (crocodile-line archosaurs) from the Triassic. However, \\"Rauisuchia\\" is currently considered to be a paraphyletic grade of archosaurs incrementally closer to crocodilians, rather than a clade (a natural grouping defined by shared relations). The most recent cladistic interpretations of archosaur classification are mainly inspired by an analysis by Nesbitt (2011). He split \\"rauisuchians\\" (relabeled as Paracrocodylomorpha) into two branches: the unusual poposauroids and a more diverse branch called Loricata, which includes crocodylomorphs and ancestral forms like Postosuchus and Saurosuchus. Although most frequently compared with loricatans, Arganasuchus has yet to be properly incorporated into this newer understanding of crocodilian ancestry, and as a result its classification relative to other \\"rauisuchians\\" is poorly understood. The original description by Jalil & Peyer (2007) made many comparisons between the anatomy of Arganasuchus and other loricatans. The shape of the maxilla was similar to Batrachotomus and Fasolasuchus, the vertebrae were similar to Postosuchus, the femur was comparable to Prestosuchus, and the pubis had a few similarities with both Batrachotomus and Postosuchus. The question of Arganasuchus's relations was left unresolved, partly because its describers were aware of the uncertainty within rauisuchian taxonomy as a whole. Some phylogenetic analyses have attempted to deal with Arganasuchus, although there is no consensus on its precise affinities. Brusatte et al. (2010) found weak support for a small clade of basal \\"rauisuchoids\\" (loricatans) containing Arganasuchus, Fasolasuchus, Stagonosuchus, and Ticinosuchus. França et al. (2011) found that Arganasuchus was an unstable \\"wildcard\\" taxon in their analysis, though a connection to Decuriasuchus, Prestosuchus, and Batrachotomus was one possibility.

Life Antony Samheri was born on 3 November 1801 in Mosul in a Syriac Orthodox family. He was ordained priest on 15 August 1822 and consecrated coadjutor bishop of Mardin in January 1826 by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius George V. In the Dayr al-Zafaran monastery he found books about the Catholic Church and he took into the Catholic faith. He spoke with his Patriarch who said him to take time, but on 17 March 1828, with Grégorios Issa Mahfouz bishop of Jerusalem and one hundred fifty families, Antony Samheri formally joined the Syriac Catholic Church. For this act he was imprisoned and humiliated for eight months, till a payment of a ransom to the local Ottoman authority. In 1840 he was appointed patriarchal vicar for the Melkite community in Amid. He was elected Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church on 30 November 1853, enthroned on 8 December 1853, and early in 1854 he traveled to Rome where Pope Pius IX personally invested him on 7 March 1854. From Rome Antony Samheri went in France (he was the godfather of Louis Napoléon), Belgium and Netherlands to raise funds. After two years of traveling in Europe Rome urged him to return to his flock, where he financed the building of many churches. He died in Mardin on 16 June 1864.. The present bishops of the Syrian Catholic Church derive their apostolic succession from him.

Definitions  The term \\"poster stamp\\" is as its name suggests a stamp imprinted with the design of a poster that won an award in a poster contest. The City of Newark, New Jersey, for example, for the celebration of the 250th Anniversary of the City 1666–1916 had a Committee of the One Hundred organize in 1915 a poster contest inviting ten internationally known poster artists to compete against any other artist in the public forum who wished to enter the contest.

One definition has been \\"labels without postage stamp values, not good for postal service; advertising labels or charity labels.\\" Patrick, Douglas & Mary. The Hodder Stamp Dictionary. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1973, p. 191. The 1864 Shakespeare Penny Memorial poster stamp  Origins  The first poster stamps were inspired by the invention of the postage stamp. A perforated label was produced in England in 1864 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth and in Italy a label was produced in 1860 to celebrate Garibaldi's expedition to Sicily during the campaign to unify Italy.Mackay, James. The Complete Guide to Stamps and Stamp Collecting. London: Hermes House, 2005, p.62. Commercial interests soon realised the publicity potential of the stamps and they were quickly adopted for the promotion of every type of product and cause. Poster stamps were also widely used by both sides during World War One as political propaganda. Fascism in Italy (1922-1943) used poster stamps, and sometimes regular stamps, to increase the popularity of italian mass flights: Crociera Aviatoria del Mediterraneo Orientale 1929; Crociera Aerea Italia-Brasile 1930; and Crociera Aerea del Decennale 1933.  Scope  As late as the 1930s they were still being used to promote political and other causes. In 1937, Irene Harand published a series of anti-Nazi poster stamps portraying the contributions made by Jews to civilisation over the centuries.Rogers, Peter. \\"Irene Harand and The Truth About Anti-Semitism.\\" in The Cinderella Philatelist. Vol.48, No.3, July 2008, p.124. Adhesive labels of all kinds that are not postage stamps continue to be produced today to promote particular causes or events.  Vintage method revival  In 2017, two designers of Plazm (magazine) launched The Portland Stamp Company to revive the poster stamp tradition using vintage perforation equipment. Their revival stamps were featured in the monthly subscription service Mail More Love, pictured in Oprah magazine.

If a felon has three or more prior convictions for offenses that are \\"violent felony\\" offenses or \\"serious drug offenses,\\"The prior convictions are referred to as \\"predicate\\" convictions: the government must prove the existence of three prior convictions as a \\"predicate\\" for the imposition of the sentence enhancement. the Act provides a minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment, instead of the ten-year maximum prescribed under the Gun Control Act. The Act provides for an implied maximum sentence of life imprisonment. History of ACCA The ACCA has been through numerous revisions in Congress and has evolved considerably since its passage in 1984.For an analysis of the ACCA's legislative history and proposals for amending the ACCA, consult this 2009 article from the Harvard Journal on Legislation: The Armed Career Criminal Act and the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines: Moving Toward Consistency, 46 Harv. J. on Legis. 537 (2009) The ACCA was originally included with the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 sponsored by the Reagan AdministrationWhen H.R. 6248 was passed by Congress and presented to Reagan for signature, he vetoed the bill on the ground that identical provisions had been enacted a week earlier as part of P.L. 98-473. Reagan Veto Memorandum. and enhanced the penalties for possession of firearms under the Gun Control Act for felons who had been convicted three times of robbery or burglary.The original ACCA was codified at 18 U.S.C. 1202(a). Cases involving the ACCA The definition of \\"violent felony\\" in ACCA18 U.S.C. 924(e)(2)(B) has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in Begay v. United States and Chambers v. United States, which determined that neither drunk driving nor failure to report for incarceration were considered violent felonies, respectively.Chambers at LII The Supreme Court ruled in Stokeling v. United States (Docket 17-5554) in January 2019 that criminal acts like pick pocketing and purse snatching should only be considered violent felonies if the perpetrator employed more force than is necessary to remove the property from that person. The Government further stated that, “slight offensive touching” would not satisfy the Florida robbery statute. Therefore, not all incidents of pick pocketing or snatching are automatically considered robbery offenses under the Florida statute which includes provisions for lesser theft crimes. The definition of a \\"serious\\" drug crime924(e)(2)(A) was considered and further defined by the Supreme Court in United States v. Rodriquez. In Taylor v. United States, the Court was called upon to determine the meaning of the word \\"burglary\\" in ACCA and, specifically, whether a conviction in Missouri for second-degree burglary was, in fact, a predicate conviction. The court concluded that an offense constitutes \\"burglary\\" under 924(e) if, regardless of its exact definition or label, it has the basic elements of burglary. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Johnson v. United States that part of the ACCA is unconstitutional. The Court struck down a \\"catchall phrase\\" (also known as a residual clause) in the ACCA that was described as \\"vague\\" in outlining acts that could result in a harsher sentence.http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/26/supreme-court-strikes- down-vague-part-career-criminal-law/ \\"Under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm faces more severe punishment if he has three or more previous convictions for a 'violent felony,' a term defined to include any felony that 'involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.' 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B). We must decide whether this part of the definition of a violent felony survives the Constitution’s prohibition of vague criminal laws...We hold that imposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act violates the Constitution’s guarantee of due process. Our contrary holdings in James and Sykes are overruled. Today’s decision does not call into question application of the Act to the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the Act’s definition of a violent felony.\\" FootnotesExternal links * Johnson v.

It was the eighth property in Los Angeles to receive Historical-Cultural Monument status. Figueroa Street The original site of the house was part of the original Pueblo de Los Angeles lands at the corner of 7th Street and Figueroa Street (then known as Grasshopper Street) in Downtown Los Angeles. In 1872, Samuel Calvert Foy (September 23, 1840 – April 24, 1901) purchased the property from Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Foster for $1,000. Foy moved to Los Angeles in 1854 and operated a successful harness business at 217 Los Angeles Street, which was the oldest business establishment in the city at the time of his death. Foy also served as the city's Chief of Police for a time. He built the Foy House at the corner of Grasshopper and 7th Streets in either 1872 or 1873, and it was there that Foy and his wife, Lucinda Macy Foy, raised their son and four daughters. The house was reportedly \\"the first three-story building in the city.\\" At the time the Foys built their house, the site was considered to be \\"way out in the country.\\" The house's design is attributed to Ezra F. Kysor.\\"Foy House\\". https://www.laconservancy.org. n.d. Web. Foy's daughter, Mary Foy, was the city's first woman librarian from 1880–1884, a leader in the California Women's suffrage movement, a leader of the Democratic Party, and the first woman to be a member of one of the major parties' national committees. Foy suffered from \\"dropsical trouble\\" during the last two years of his life and was eventually confined to the home. He died in April 1901, but his wife Lucinda Macy Foy remained in residence at the house. As the city's business district expanded rapidly in the 1910s, the one-and-a-half acre site became one of the choicest building sites in the business district with 217 feet of frontage on Figueroa Street and 236 feet on Seventh Street. The Wilshire Grand Hotel building was located at the building's original site from 1952–2012. Witmer Street In December 1919, the Foy family sold the property for a consideration reported to be approximately $600,000. At the time of the property's sale in 1919, the new owner announced its plan to start construction immediately of a six- or seven-story structure on the site at a cost of $450,000. Though there are varying accounts as to the date (either 1906, 1918, or 1920), the Foy House was moved to its second site on 631–633 South Witmer Street, just north of Wilshire Boulevard and across from Good Samaritan Hospital. For more than 30 years from 1951 to at least 1981, the house served as the headquarters for Magma Power Co., one of the pioneering companies in the field of geothermal energy. In September 1962, the Foy House was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #8), only the eighth property to receive the designation. In 1974, Magma Power restored the house at a cost of $50,000, using the services of five-time Oscar-winning set designer, F. Keogh Gleason, for the interior renovation. In 1981, About 10 of Magma's employees worked at Foy House. In the early 1980s, the house was donated to Good Samaritan Hospital by businessman Ben Weingart. Carroll Avenue The house had fallen into disrepair by the early 1990s. In 1992, the Good Samaritan Hospital reached an agreement with James Prager, an attorney who owned a Victorian home in the Carroll Avenue historic district in Angelino Heights. The hospital agreed to contribute to the move of the house, and Prager agreed to restore the home. In December 1992, the house was moved to its third location at 1337 Carroll Avenue. The Foy House was the seventh house to be moved to Angelino Heights, the first and largest historic preservation zone in the City of Los Angeles. From 1998 through 2006 it was highlighted in several episodes of the television series Charmed. In 2011, it was used as the exterior of J Edgar Hoover's parents home in the movie \\"J. Edgar\\". In 2012, it was featured in the movie Guilt Trip, as Andy Margolis Jr.'s house.

The school was Ireland's first Catholic co-educational secondary school. History In 1919, two Sisters of Mercy arrived in Louisburgh, and began the development of what would become the first Catholic co-educational secondary school in Ireland. The school was originally called Holy Rosary Secondary School, but more familiarly known as ‘The Convent’. When the school first opened there were only twenty pupils who had to pay a fee of £9 per student per school year. The school was extended several times during the 20th century, with significant works undertaken in the 1980s. By the early 21st century, the school was operated under the trusteeship of Catholic Education an Irish Schools Trust (CEIST). In 2008, the school was ranked 15 (out of 28) in Mayo for third level attendance with 77% progressing to third level. The majority of students (27.5%) enrolled in NUI Galway. In 2017, the school underwent an extension project which cost €7 million. The project continued for 20 months and included the construction of a new 2-storey extension comprising new main entrance, 12 specialist classrooms, general purpose/dining room and a kitchenette.

The hypertonic and relatively hypoxic environment of the renal medulla, coupled with the slow blood flow in the vasa recta, favors sickling of red blood cells, with resultant local infarction (papillary necrosis). Functional tubule defects in patients with sickle cell disease are likely the result of partial ischemic injury to the renal tubules. Also the sickle cell disease in young patients is characterized by renal hyperperfusion, glomerular hypertrophy, and glomerular hyperfiltration. Many of these individuals eventually develop a glomerulopathy leading to glomerular proteinuria (present in as many as 30%) and, in some, the nephrotic syndrome. Co-inheritance of microdeletions in the -globin gene (thalassemia) appear to protect against the development of nephropathy and are associated with lower mean arterial pressure and less protein in the urine. Mild increases in the blood levels of nitrogen and uric acid can also develop. Advanced kidney failure and high blood urea levels occur in 10% of cases. Pathologic examination reveals the typical lesion of \\"hyperfiltration nephropathy\\" namely, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. This finding has led to the suggestion that anemia-induced hyperfiltration in childhood is the principal cause of the adult glomerulopathy. Nephron loss secondary to ischemic injury also contributes to the development of azotemia in these patients. In addition to the glomerulopathy described above, kidney complications of sickle cell disease include cortical infarcts leading to loss of function, persistent bloody urine, and perinephric hematomas. Papillary infarcts, demonstrable radiographically in 50% of patients with sickle trait, lead to an increased risk of bacterial infection in the scarred kidney tissues and functional tubule abnormalities. The presence of visible blood in the urine without pain occurs with a higher frequency in sickle trait than in sickle cell disease and likely results from infarctive episodes in the renal medulla. Functional tubule abnormalities such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus result from marked reduction in vasa recta blood flow, combined with ischemic tubule injury. This concentrating defect places these patients at increased risk of dehydration and, hence, sickling crises. The concentrating defect also occurs in individuals with sickle trait. Other tubule defects involve potassium and hydrogen ion excretion, occasionally leading to high blood potassium, metabolic acidosis, and a defect in uric acid excretion which, combined with increased purine synthesis in the bone marrow, results in high blood uric acid levels.

History George Steuart Hume inherited Argaty in the late 1700s =Origins= Argaty (aka \\"Ardgaty\\"), derives from the Gaelic words aird, meaning \\"height\\", and gaoth, meaning \\"wind\\" and therefore translates as \\"windy height\\". =Medieval era= Argaty was originally part of the Doune estate, property of the Dukes of Albany, ancestors of the Clan Stewart of Balquhidder. When Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany was executed for treason by King James I of Scotland in 1425, the Stewart lands were forfeited to the Crown, and Argaty was among the forfeited properties. After the forfeiture the Crown granted the lands of Argaty to one John Sinclair, Esquire to the King's Chamber. The property then passed to Sinclair's younger daughter who married Patrick Home (also spelled \\"Hume\\") of Polworth, and Argaty thus came into the possession of the Home family.Burke, p.169 Retrieved March 2012 =18th Century= Around 150 years later the property was again inherited by a daughter, one Mary Hume, who married George Stewart (also spelled \\"Steuart\\") of Ballachallan. George Stewart was a descendant of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany and, by this marriage, the ownership of Argaty returned to the descendants of the very same Stewarts who had forfeited it some three centuries earlier.Stewarts of Balquhidder webpage In 1758 Argaty was inherited by the Maryland planter and Loyalist politician George Hume Steuart of Annapolis, Maryland, second son of George Steuart and Mary Hume. Steuart also held extensive lands in Maryland and, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in 1775, he was forced to leave America and return to Scotland, dividing his estates among his family. His son, also named George Hume Steuart (1747–1788), inherited Argaty estate in his turn, changing his name to George Steuart Hume.Nelker, p.24. Presumably the estate was entailed. On Hume's death in 1788, Argaty passed to George Steuart Hume's infant daughter Sophia. Hume's younger brothers Charles and James Steuart, by now citizens of the fledgling United States of America, brought a claim against their infant niece Sophia for the inheritance of Argaty, but were not successful. =19th Century= Sophia Hume married her cousin, David Monro Binning of Softlaw, a barrister,The Law Magazine and Review: for both branches of the legal profession at home and abroad, Butterworths (1864) Retrieved March 2012 and by the early Nineteenth century the house and estate were in the possession of the Binning-Home family.Burke, p.168 Retrieved March 2012 Later in the 19th Century the house was extensively re-modelled. A shorthorn bull named Alban, raised by Mr G. H. M. Binning-Home of Argaty and calved in 1868, appears in Coate's Herd Book, Volume 19, the publication of the Shorthorn Society of the United Kingdom.Coates, George, p.3, Coates's Herd Book, Volume 19, Shorthorn Society of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Retrieved March 2012 At this time the estate acquired something of a name for breeding shorthorn cattle.History of Argaty at Fraiser Raitts Webspace Retrieved March 2012 =20th Century= In the 20th century ownership of the estate passed through a number of hands. Mr and Mrs Henderson bought Argaty in 1916. Their daughter and son-in-law, Mr D.C. Bowser and Mrs M. Bowser, eventually inherited and ran the estate. From 1947 to 1986 the estate was run by a Capt. D. Bowser. In 1982 ownership of Argaty House and the estate were separated. Argaty today Today Mr Niall Bowser and his wife Lynn run the estate from Lerrocks Farm.

Recognized in his native Brazil and abroad as the creator of a unique style that blends contemporary classical music and jazz with avant-garde forms and Brazilian motifs, he wrote award-winning music which includes works for piano, orchestra and ensembles of various configurations as well as electroacoustic music, film scores, television, opera, dance and theater. Born in São Paulo in 1956, he began his piano studies piano at age 4, and later studied with pianist Menininha Lobo. A passion for the avant-garde styles came at an early age, and at age 17, he was invited to the group of Hermeto Pascoal along with his brother, drummer Ze Eduardo Nazario. The brothers and the bassist, Zeca Assumpção, formed what became known as “The S. Paulo Rhythm Section” of the Hermeto group until 1977. In search of his own musical style, he formed the Grupo UM in 1976, using bold and dense sound experiments to create an original repertoire that combined acoustic music and Brazilian rhythms in a contemporary musical structure. With the Grupo, he released three albums, including Marcha Sobre A Cidade (1979), the first instrumental album issued in Brazil and considered one of the most important records of the history of Brazilian instrumental music. During this same time, he also led the Symmetric Ensemble (two pianos and two basses), trying new sounds in a non-conventional formation. In 1980, he created the Utopia Studio, where he developed pioneering experiments and music that blurred the boundaries between popular forms, producing his first solo albums: Lagrima / Sursolide suite (1982), Discurso aos Objetos / Balada Unidimensional (1984) and \\"Se ...\\" (1989). Between 1989 and 2000, he joined the Pau Brazil group, with which he recorded four albums, among them Pau Brasil & Hermeto Pascoal (1994) and Babel (1996), which won the Sharp Award for Best Instrumental Group of the Year and also won the 1998 Grammy nomination in the Jazz category. In partnership with the group, he composed the Opera dos 500, by Naum Alves de Souza, staged on the occasion of the 500 years of America in Teatro Municipal de São Paulo. He created original soundtracks for short and feature films such as Anchieta José do Brazil (Sergio G. Saraceni), in partnership with Marlui Miranda, Hans Staden, and Luiz A. Pereira, which received the award for best soundtrack at the Film Festival of Brasília in 2000. He worked with choreographers such as Takao Kusuno, Claudia de Souza and Germaine Acogny. Commissioned by the Symphonic Band of São Paulo (BSESP), he composed Limite (1990) and Aurora (1996), for symphonic band, electronic keyboards, prerecorded sounds and percussion. The works were presented by BSESP, with the Duo Nazario (formed with his brother Zé Eduardo), at the Teatro Municipal of Rio de Janeiro (at the Bienal de Musica Contemporânea) in Memorial da América Latina, in São Paulo, and the Conference World Association for Symphonic Bands and Ensembles, Austria. Along with Zé Eduardo and guitarist Felipe Avila, he formed the Percussonica group in 1998, which recorded two CDs. Following with his solo work, he released the album Simples (1998) and Africasiamerica (2006), described as one of the top 10 instrumental CDs of the year by critic Arnaldo DeSouteiro. As musical director and arranger, he has performed in concerts and albums, including Garoto, by Paul Bellinati; Mundo, by Rodolfo Stroeter; Paiter Merewá: Suruí de Rondonia, by Marlui Miranda; Authentic South America: The Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Music (Sonoton, Germany) and Trampolim, by Monica Salmaso and Universos Sonoros para Violão e Tape, by Daniel Murray. As a pianist and keyboardist, he participated in numerous works by other composers, performers and groups. Traveling with assurance and sensitivity between new classical and jazz, Lelo Nazario is considered a virtuoso on the keyboards and a composer with a deep understanding of contemporary music, jazz and traditional Brazilian rhythms. In a career of over 30 years, he toured Europe and the United States and worked with great names of classical and jazz music including Almeida Prado, Hermeto Pascoal, conductors Roberto Farias and Gil Jardim, Edu Lobo, Gilberto Gil, Naná Vasconcelos, John Scofield, Toninho Horta, Mauro Senise, Márcio Montarroyos, Hector Costita, Benjamin Taubkin, Roberto Sion, Zeca Assumpção, Toninho Carrasqueira, Jon H.

Alexis Preller (1911-1975), South African. Oil on wood. Acc. No. 52/22 Alexis Preller (6 September 1911 – 13 December 1975) was a South African painter. He trained at the Westminster School of Art from which he graduated in 1934 and later at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris (1937). He was especially influenced by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin and visited European galleries and museums to study these artists' works. Elements of Gauguin can be seen in his paintings on South African subjects such as the Garden of Eden (1937).Catalogue of the Pretoria Art Museum Over time, he developed his own style and his works showed an array of elements from nature, African masks and other African art. One finds this overlay of his personal style on African themes most illuminatingly expressed in works such as Basuto Allegory (1947). Travels in Europe and North Africa gave further expression to his output which became influenced by the frescoes of Piero della Francesca and Egyptian murals. One sees this influence in works such as Hieratic Women (1956). Preller's later unique style isolated him from the artistic movements of the 20th century, nor did he fit into any conventional style of the old school. Although highly regarded in his native Pretoria, this was not initially the case elsewhere in South Africa - an exhibition of his works in Cape Town in the late 1960s was coolly received by art critics there.Cape Argus (1969) Recognition for his work has grown since then, and the opening of the most recent major exhibition, Africa, the Sun and the Shadows of his works at Johannesburg's Standard Bank Gallery on 13 October 2009 was strongly attended.

History  The village takes its name from the Kennetcook River which is believed to come from a Mi'kmaq word meaning \\"The Place Further Ahead or The Place Nearby\\".Nova Scotia Archives: Place Names of Nova Scotia, \\"Kennetcook\\", p. 325-326 The river was an important east-west canoe and portage route for the Mi'kmaq people connecting the Piziquid (Windsor) area with the canoe routes and settlement areas along the Shubenacadie River. A trail from Halifax to the Acadian settlements at Noel on the Minas Basin crossed the Kennetcook River at a ford near the site of the village, making it an early crossroads.\\"Kennetcook - History\\", Municipality of East Hants After the American Revolution, the village was part of the Douglas Township, which was named after Sir Charles Douglas, 1st Baronet. The village was settled by the troops of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) for their service in the war, protecting Nova Scotia from ongoing American Patriot attacks by land and sea. Joseph Salter, the noted shipbuilder and first mayor of Moncton, New Brunswick, was born in Kennetcook in 1816. In 1901, the Midland Railway was built through the village enhancing the crossroads as a retail and service centre for the area. Kennetcook grew to host a hotel by the station, a bank and several stores. The Midland was acquired by the Dominion Atlantic Railway in 1905 and later by the Canadian Pacific which added further rail traffic as well as shipping farm products and lumber from Kennetcook through connections to Windsor and Truro. Highway construction after World War Two undermine railway traffic leading to the end of passenger and regular freight service in 1979 and removal of the railway in 1983.\\"Kennetcook\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Institute  Bridges and transportation  Kennetcook, Nova Scotia A covered bridge spanned the Kennetcook River until 1967. This was the last covered bridge in Nova Scotia. Currently, efforts are underway to revitalize the downtown through development and implementation of an economic development plan. This development plan will include the construction of an amphitheatre, multi-purpose center, commercial development space and the re-construction of the covered bridge. Kennetcook was also known for its Douglas Township celebration every year. Literary connections The \\"Father of Canadian Poetry\\" Sir Charles G.D. Roberts wrote a fictional story that was set just before the Expulsion of the Acadians (1755). The story is an account of a Mi'kmaq raid on British settlers in Kennetcook entitled \\"Raid on Kennetcook\\" (alternatively titled \\"Raid from Beauséjour\\"). Roberts wrote the story in 1894 while he worked at University of King's College, which was then located in Windsor, Nova Scotia. In 1953, the noted Canadian poet Alden Nowlan graduated from the Folk School located in the Kennetcook Hotel (present-day Law Office).  Notable residents  * Robert Paterson, gardner for William D.

Biography He was the son of Ernest Schuster, a King's Counsel, and was educated at Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1905. In 1908 he married Gwendolen Parker, daughter of Mr Justice Parker, later Baron Parker of Waddington. At the outbreak of the First World War, Schuster was working in finance in the City of London, and was prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for Eskdale, North Cumberland.Lloyd George, Liberalism and the Land: The Land Issue and Party Politics in England, 1906-1914 By Ian Packer He held a commission in the Oxfordshire Yeomanry, and was mobilised to serve on the Western Front until 1918, when he joined the allied force in the Murmansk area. He ended the war with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, having been awarded the Military Cross and appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was also decorated with the Russian Order of St. Vladimir. Following the war he took further training in finance at the University of Birmingham, and became a member of the treasury advisory committee of the League of Nations. In 1922 he was appointed Financial Secretary to the Government of Sudan. In 1925 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In 1927 he ended his appointment to the government of Sudan, having been appointed as Economic and Financial Advisor to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1928 he succeeded Sir Basil Phillott Blackett as finance minister of the Council of India. In 1931 he was made a Knight Commander of the Star of India. He served as finance minister until 1929, during which time he was injured during a bomb attack in the Central Legislative Assembly by Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt. On return to the UK, Schuster resumed his career in banking. In August 1938 the sitting Liberal National Member of Parliament (MP) for Walsall, Joseph Leckie, died. The parties forming the National Government agreed on Schuster as their candidate, nominated by the Liberal Nationals and supported by the Conservatives. Schuster was opposed by George Jeger of the Labour Party, and foreign policy was the main issue at the by-election. Polling took place on 16 November, and Schuster comfortably held the seat for the government with a majority of 7,158 over Jeger. His Liberal National colleague Robert Bernays, who opened the by-election campaign with a speech in Walsall on 31 October, remarked that \\"[i]n three weeks of campaigning the Schusters captured the hearts of the town\\".Nick Smart, ed. The Diaries and Letters of Robert Bernays, 1932-1939: An Insider's Account of the House of Commons (Lewiston/Queenston/Lampeter: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1996), p.380 He remained a member of the House of Commons until 1945, working with Stafford Cripps on war production. At the 1945 general election he was defeated, with Labour's Major W T Wells taking the seat. Following the loss of his seat, Schuster was given a number of appointments to official bodies: he was chairman of the Cotton Working Party, a member of the committee on industrial productivity, and conducted an inquiry into the finances of Malta. In 1951 he became chairman of the Oxford Regional Hospital Board. He also led a highly successful campaign to raise corporate funding for the Public Schools Appointments Board which encouraged young people to enter a wider range of careers than previously. He subsequently chaired the organisation. In 1962 he became honorary treasurer of the international development charity, Voluntary Service Overseas and was involved in fund-raising for the establishment of the United World College of the Atlantic, of which he was chairman of the board of governors until 1973.

During his early career, he was a close associate of the Earl of Cadogan and the Duke of Marlborough. Between 1715 and 1720, he was also employed as a British political and diplomatic agent, primarily involved in anti-Jacobite operations. He commanded a brigade at Dettingen; during the Jacobite rising of 1745, he fought at Falkirk Muir and Culloden. Promoted major-general in 1743, his active career finished when the War of the Austrian Succession ended in 1748. He never married and died in London on 18 January 1761. His brother Ellis emigrated to North America; one of his relatives, another John Huske, was a delegate to the 1789 North Carolina Constitutional Convention. Life John Huske was born in 1692, eldest son of John (1651–1703) and Mary Huske (1656–?); little is known of his family background, other than they were members of the minor gentry in Newmarket, Suffolk. His younger brother Ellis (1700–1755) emigrated to North America, where he worked as a journalist; Richard died in July 1760. He never married and when he died in January 1761, most of his estate was left to friends and servants. This included £5,000 (2019; £1 million) to his head groom, £3,000 to his valet, and £100 to the 'poor of Newmarket.' He bequeathed minor amounts to his nieces and nephews, with the notable exception of Ellis' son John (1724–1773). Described by historian Lewis Namier as a 'tough, unscrupulous adventurer,' he was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and came to England in 1748. Elected MP for Maldon in 1763, he worked closely with Charles Townshend, author of the 1765 Stamp Act, one of the issues leading to the 1775 American Revolution. Accused of embezzling £30,000–£40,000, he fled to Paris in 1769, where he died in 1773. Another relative, John Huske (?–1792) was a representative to the 1788 Hillsborough Convention and the 1789 Fayetteville Convention in North Carolina. Career William Cadogan (1671–1726); Huske was closely associated with him for nearly 20 years Huske began his military career as an ensign in Caulfield's Regiment of Foot, a unit recruited in Ireland and sent to garrison Barcelona in May 1706. The date of his commission is given as August, 1707, several months after the regiment and four others had been officially disbanded. A Parliamentary committee held in April showed it arrived in Spain significantly understrength. This makes Huske's early movements hard to trace, but in March 1709, he was commissioned cornet in the 5th Dragoon Guards, based in Flanders, and served at Malplaquet. The 5th Dragoons was commanded by William Cadogan, close aide to the Duke of Marlborough a connection of great benefit to Huske's career. In March 1709, he became an ensign in the Foot Guards, although this did not imply service; only 16 of its nominal 24 companies were actually formed and Huske remained with his original unit. Under the practice known as double-ranking, Guards officers held a second and higher army rank; a Guards ensign ranked as a regular army captain. A Guards commission automatically gave its holder higher precedence in determining promotions and since they were rarely disbanded, Marlborough used it to reward competent, but poor officers. George I succeeded Queen Anne in 1714, and in January 1715, Huske became a captain in the 15th Foot; in July, he also received a captain's commission in the Coldstream Guards. When the Jacobite rising of 1715 began, the Whig administration approved the detention of six Members of Parliament, including Sir William Wyndham, a Tory leader in South-West England and Jacobite sympathiser. Wyndham's brother-in- law was the Earl of Hertford, colonel of Huske's regiment, the 15th Foot. Sir William Wyndham This may explain why Huske was sent to arrest Wyndham. When Huske arrived at his home near Minehead, Wyndham promised to accompany him after saying goodbye to his wife, before escaping through a window. Given the prevailing social convention that a gentleman's word was his bond, this was felt to reflect badly on Wyndham, who was recaptured soon after. Huske escaped blame and joined Cadogan in the Dutch Republic, where he helped arrange the transport of 6,000 Dutch troops to Scotland. Marlborough suffered the first of a series of strokes in May 1716; he remained Master-General of the Ordnance or army commander until his death in 1722, but Cadogan took over many of his duties. Huske took part in a number of anti-Jacobite intelligence operations; during the 1719 Rising, he worked with diplomat Charles Whitworth to transfer five Dutch battalions to Britain, although the revolt collapsed before this became necessary. Huske and the Earl of Albemarle accompanied Cadogan on his 1720 diplomatic mission to Vienna, the beginning of a long friendship between the two men. It was a high-profile assignment, trying to create an anti- Russian alliance, and end Swedish support for the Jacobites. Cadogan became Master-General when Marlborough died in 1722, before being disgraced by his involvement in the financial scandal known as the South Sea bubble. Huske was appointed lieutenant governor of Hurst Castle in July 1721; Cadogan's death in 1726, and the slow pace of promotion in peace time meant by 1739, he was still a major. When the War of the Austrian Succession began in December 1740, he became colonel of the 32nd Foot; transferred to Flanders, he was badly wounded commanding a brigade at Dettingen in June 1743. Now chiefly remembered as the last time a British monarch led troops in battle, Huske was promoted major general in July, appointed colonel of the 23rd Foot, and made Governor of Sheerness in 1745. 1745 Rebellion The Jacobite rising of 1745 began in August; in September, Huske landed in Newcastle with 6,000 German and Dutch troops, captured at Tournai in June and released on condition they did not fight against the French. After a long and distinguished career, George Wade, commander in the North, was no longer fit for service, the Dutch and Germans refused to march without being paid in advance and one observer wrote, 'I never saw so ill a conducted Machine as Our Army.' Battle of Culloden; Huske commanded the second line on the government left The Jacobites invaded England on 8 November, before turning back at Derby on 6 December; leaving a garrison at Carlisle, they re-entered Scotland on 21 December. Cumberland and the main field army besieged Carlisle; Henry Hawley was appointed commander in Scotland, with Huske as his deputy. After arriving in Edinburgh, on 13 January 1746 Huske and 4,000 men moved north to relieve Stirling Castle, then besieged by the Jacobites. Hawley and an additional 3,000 men met up with him at Falkirk on 16 January, where the main Jacobite force was waiting. Hawley overestimated both the vulnerability of Highland infantry to cavalry, and seriously underestimated their numbers and fighting qualities. This contributed to his defeat at Falkirk Muir on 17 January, a battle that started late in the afternoon in failing light and heavy snow and was marked by confusion on both sides. The government dragoons charged the Jacobite right but were repulsed in disorder, scattering their own infantry who also fled; the regiments under Huske held their ground, allowing the bulk of the army to withdraw in good order. They were helped by confusion among the Jacobite commanders and by the Highlanders diverting to loot the baggage train. Cumberland arrived in Edinburgh on 30 January and resumed the advance while the Jacobites retreated to Inverness. At the Battle of Culloden on 16 April, Huske commanded the reserves on the government left, which took the weight of the Jacobite charge. The front rank gave ground, but Huske brought his troops onto their flank, exposing the Highlanders to volleys of fire at close range from three sides. Unable to respond, they broke and fled, the battle lasting less than forty minutes. Jacobite losses were estimated as between 1,200 and 1,500 dead, many killed during the pursuit that followed; this was common, and troops that held together, such as the French regulars, were far less vulnerable than those who scattered like the Highlanders. The widely reported killing of Jacobite wounded after the battle, allegedly on the orders of senior government officers, was certainly unusual. When Huske was based at Fort Augustus as commander of 'pacification' operations, he proposed a £5 bounty for the head of every rebel brought into camp. While this was rejected, author and historian John Prebble refers to the killings as 'symptomatic of the army's general mood and behaviour.' Post-1745 Career Albemarle (1702-1754); a long time friend, Huske was buried next to him Huske was promoted lieutenant general for his service during the Rising, and returned to Flanders, where his regiment suffered heavy casualties in the Allied defeat at Lauffeld in July 1747. Shortly afterwards, Cumberland sent him to inspect and report back on the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom, then besieged by the French; it surrendered in September. Huske's active military career ended with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; while he remained colonel, he did not accompany his regiment when it was sent to Minorca in 1755. Along with the rest of the garrison, in June 1756 the 23rd surrendered to the French in the opening battle of the Seven Years' War, a defeat that led to the execution of Admiral John Byng. A 1757 investigation noted the poor state of the island's defences, with crumbling walls and rotten gun platforms; over 35 senior officers were absent from their posts, including the colonels of all four regiments in its garrison, one being Huske. However, the practice of delegating was common; although appointed Governor of Jersey in 1749, Huske appears to have visited the island only once, in 1751. His will left £2,000 to Charles d'Auvergne, who deputised for him in Jersey. He purchased a small estate in Ealing, then outside London, and rented a house in Albemarle Street, London, where he died on 18 January 1761. As instructed in his will, he was buried without ceremony in Grosvenor Chapel, Audley Street, London; his coffin was placed next to that of Albemarle, his long-time friend and colleague who died in 1754.

Hair dressing might also include the use of product to add texture, shine, curl, volume or hold to a particular style.  Types of hairstyling tools  Hair styling equipment which helps in creating hairstyles includes: = Hair irons = Early hair tongs A hair iron is a tool used to change the structure of the hair with the help of heat. There are three general kinds: curling tongs, also known as curling irons, used to make the hair curly; straighteners, also known as flat irons, used to straighten the hair; and crimpers, used to create small crimps in the hair. = Hair dryers = Modern-day blowdryer A hand dryer, hairdryer, or blowdryer is an electromechanical device designed to blow cool or hot air over wet or damp hair, in order to accelerate the evaporation of water particles and dry the hair. Blowdryers allow to better control the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds inside each strand. These hydrogen bonds are very powerful (allowing for stronger hair shaping than even the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products), but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair. = Hairbrushes = A flat hairbrush is used to detangle unkempt hair. A round hairbrush is used to style hair for neat and tidy hair, medium length, with a blowdryer. A brush is typically used on longer hair but can still be used for shorter hair, which is normally dealt with using a comb. A flat brush is normally used for detangling neat and tidy hair, after a sleep; a round brush for styling and curling hair, especially by a professional stylist, and with a blowdryer. A paddle brush is used to straighten hair, but not all work; they are usually used on untidy unkept hair. A hairbrush is also useful in removing loose hairs and in increasing circulation to the scalp. The brushing of a domestic animal's fur, particularly cats and dogs, is often perceived as a mark of affection and/or a bonding experience, which can have a soothing effect, e.g. making a cat purr. It is also often nessesary during shedding season, as is often reccomend by veterinarians, particularly for animals with longer or thicker fur, to aid the animal in grooming and prevent the shed fur from covering surfaces in a household. In the case of cats - brushing is often done to prevent hairballs. Special brushes are made for cats and dogs. Brushes are often small and rectangular, with the width wider than the length, and an angled handle, designed for the ergonomics of a human brushing an animal which is below them, parallel to the ground, and or simply has a lot of surface area to be brushed. Varieties include a wire bristle brush, plastic or horsehair bristle brush, and small narrow toothed combs. For an equine's tougher hair, a curry-comb is used. = Scissors = Different types of scissors - sewing (left), paper (middle), kitchen (right) Scissors or shears are hand-operated cutting instruments. For people without hands, there is also the option of using a specially designed foot-operated style. They consist of a pair of metal blades connected in such a way that the blades meet and cut. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, thin plastic, cloth, rope, and wire. Scissors can also be used to cut hair and food. Scissors and shears exist in a wide variety of forms depending on their intended uses. Children's scissors, used only on paper, have dull blades to ensure safety. Scissors used to cut hair or fabric must be much sharper. The largest shears used to cut metal or to trim shrubs must have very strong, sharp blades. Specialized scissors include sewing scissors, which often have one sharp point and one blunt point for intricate cutting of fabric, and nail scissors, which have curved blades for cutting fingernails and toenails. Special kinds of shears include pinking shears, which have notched blades that cut cloth to give it a wavy edge, and thinning shears, which have teeth that thin hair rather than trim it. = Combs = A comb A comb is a device made of solid material, generally flat, always toothed, and is used in hair care for straightening and cleaning hair or other fibers. Combs are among the oldest tools found by archaeologists, having been discovered in very refined forms from settlements dating back to 5000 years ago in Persia. = Hair clippers = Electric hair clippers have gradually displaced manual hair clippers. Today, electric hair clippers are used by the vast majority of barbers in industrialized countries. All of these companies offer electric hair clippers in differing grades from bargain consumer units to high-end professional units. Most consumer grade clippers are intended for personal use by individual consumers and are often sold in kits which include several accessories such as clipper guides (for adjusting the length of the cut). Professional units are intended for hair care professionals and often are sold without any accessories (which must be ordered separately). The quality difference between the consumer grade and professional grade electric clippers has narrowed significantly over the years. Today the primary difference between the two grades is usually added or enhanced insulating for internal electrical components to prevent the unit from heating up during periods of prolonged usage. Some companies, such as Conair and Andis, replace some plastic parts in consumer grade units with metal parts on their professional grade units to extend the durability and useful lifespan of the product. Some companies, such as Wahl Clipper, produce specialty clippers, such as the Trim n Vac, which are designed for ease of use at home. = Hair rollers = Hair rollers Traditionally, a hair roller is a small roller with velcro used for styling and curling hair, and with a blowdryer. The damage that extensive heat application can cause to hair is well known however and so a number of alternative, heat-free hair rollers have been manufactured for the market. = Ribbon = A ribbon or riband is a thin band of flexible material, typically cloth but also plastic or sometimes metal, used for ribbon cuttingsilk, are often used in connection with dress, but also applied for innumerable useful, ornamental and symbolic purposes; cultures around the world use this device in their hair, around the body, or even as ornamentation on animals, buildings, and other areas. Ribbon is also sometimes used as a package sealer, on par with twine. = Hair elastics = Five rubber bands A rubber band (in some regions known as a binder, elastic band, lackey band, laggy band, lacka band or gumband) is a short length of rubber and latex formed in the shape of a loop. In the U.S. it is called a hair tie, and is often covered with fabric. Such bands are typically used to hold pony tails and braids together. = Kanzashi = Gold plated brass kanzashi. Period unknown. Kanzashi (簪) are hair ornaments used in traditional Japanese hairstyles. Kanzashi first appeared when women abandoned the traditional taregami hairstyle where the hair was kept straight and long, and adopted coiffured nihongami hairstyles. Kanzashi came into wide use during the Edo period when artisans began to produce more finely crafted products. Some believe they may also have been used for defence in an emergency. Nowadays, kanzashi are most often worn by brides and professional kimono wearers such as geisha, tayu and yujo or adepts in Japanese tea ceremony and ikebana. However, there is currently a revival among young Japanese women who wish to add an elegant touch to their business suit. Kanzashi are fabricated from a wide range of materials such as lacquered wood, gold and silver plated metal, tortoiseshell and silk, and recently, plastic. In fact, early bakelite kanzashi are extremely collectible. There are many varieties and many styles of wearing them. The way in which a geisha wears her kanzashi indicates her status immediately to an informed audience; according to the type and location of the kanzashi. Maiko (apprentice geisha) usually wear more numerous and elaborate kanzashi than older geisha and progress through several hairstyles where the kanzashi must be worn in a fixed pattern. = Headband (Alice bands) = A hard plastic headband, or Alice band A headband is a clothing accessory worn in the hair or around the forehead, usually to hold hair away from the face or eyes. Headbands generally consist of a loop of elastic material or a horseshoe-shaped piece of flexible plastic or metal. They come in assorted shapes and sizes and are used for both practical and fashion purposes. Horseshoe-shaped headbands are sometimes called Alice bands after the headbands that Alice is often depicted wearing in Through the Looking-Glass. = Barrettes = A barrette (also called hair- slide in British English or a hair clip in Australian English) is a clasp or pin for holding hair in place. Barrettes are worn according to size, with small ones at the front and large ones in the back. They are used to keep hair out of the eyes or secure hairstyles but can also be just ornamental. = Hairpins = A bobby pin, a type of hairpin A hair pin or hairpin is a long device used to hold a person's hair in place. Hairpins made of metal, ivory, bronze, carved wood, etc. were used in ancient Assyria and Egypt for securing decorated hairstyles. Such hairpins suggest, as graves show, that many were luxury objects among the Egyptians and later the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans. Major success came in 1901 with the invention of the spiral hairpin by New Zealand inventor Ernest Godward. This was a predecessor of the hair clip. The hairpin may be needlelike and encrusted with jewels and ornaments. It often may be more utiliarian—designed to be almost invisible after being inserted into the hairstyle. The jewels and ornaments on the hair pins add as a hair jewelry piece. In many cultures, hairpins are used with jewelry for many of occasions. For instance, in American culture, women predominantly use hairpins as a jewelry accessory at weddings, balls, and other major events. Hairpins also may be constructed from different lengths of wire that are bent in half with a u-shaped end and a few kinks along the two opposite portions. The finished pin may vary from two to six inches in final length. The length of the wires enables placement in several styles of hairdos to hold the style in place. The kinks enable retaining the pin during normal movements.

RE 19.2 Sp. 1658. The only surviving reference to Phaleas of Chalcedon appears in Aristotle's Politics. According to Aristotle, Phaleas argued that an equal division of land and equal education for all citizens would eliminate civil strife. Although Phaleas recognized that such a radical constitution would be difficult to implement in established cities, he believed it would be practicable in newly founded cities. In established cities, Phaleas recommended setting up dowries for the rich to give to the poor in order to level property ownership over time. In addition to equality of land and education, Phaleas proposed that all artisans be publicly owned slaves.Aristotle, Politics, 1267b15–19. Aristotle criticized several aspects of Phaleas' proposed constitution. Aristotle argued that while leveling land ownership would appease the poor, it would lead to insurrection among the rich who were to be dispossessed and who viewed their wealth as a right of nobility. Rather, in order to eliminate civil strife, society must educate the populace in such a way as to control want and greed; the poor must be taught to accept their station and the rich not to become overly greedy.Aristotle, Politics, 1266b35–1267a10. Aristotle further argued that equal distribution of land does not achieve equality of property, as other assets, such as cattle, furniture and slaves, are also of value; if property were to be regulated, one should regulate all types of property.Aristotle, Politics, 1267b10–14.

The film is directed by Alex Turner, whose previous effort was Dead Birds, in 2004. Plot In 2002, Jeff Keller, who mysteriously survived the slaughter of his troops during a mission, is debriefed by an officer. The facts gathered indicate that he and his soldiers had been ambushed by al-Qaeda fighters who killed them all, leaving Keller for dead. Two weeks before, in September 2002, Keller's crew gets a mission assignment and is set out to an isolated farmhouse where a family had been slaughtered days before. Their mission is to monitor a road as a sting to catch militants using it to transfer supplies. However, after an unintended stop at a mysterious shrine, a bored member of their group, Chard Davies, fires a few rounds at a stone idol, causing it to shatter. The squad's interpreter Wilcox believes that it was a shrine to a Djinn, a powerful deity made from a smokeless flame, which in mythology matched the legend of a genie. They return to their convoy and go to the farmhouse. While there, a series of bizarre events unfold. A sandstorm comes up and the group catches an unnamed Afghan woman running in, seeking shelter. Unable to speak her language they are unable to understand what she is saying, though dubious to her arrival, they keep her in case there are more. During the following days, tension begins to mount in the group. Staff Sergeant Howston is unable to reach any of their allies by radio; when Wilcox attempts to, he hears a strange distress call stating that their sergeant has gone AWOL which Howston cannot hear. Paranoia begins to get the better of them when Howston receives word that they missed a car on the road which they cannot see, and their truck's ignition system is destroyed one night. Meanwhile, Howston and Wilcox are being haunted by gruesome images of people they had killed in the past. Wilcox goes missing, and the only witness seems to be team member Tino Hull, who sees another member, Jorge Wardell, giving off a terrifying roar before him. That night, Wilcox's dead body is found with his eyes removed and his face in a frozen expression of terror, and after a series of vivid and bizarre dreams Hull grabs another member Trevor Anderson and holds him at gunpoint as he accuses Wardell of killing Wilcox. Hull opens fire on Wardell and Davies is forced to retaliate, killing Hull. Howston orders them to take the bodies outside, and the next morning, the group is shocked to find that they are missing. Howston, slowly losing his grip on his sanity, orders Keller and Anderson to keep guard outside while he himself watches to make sure nothing else goes missing. While they are gone, Davies attempts to rape the Afghan girl, and in a heated moment calls Howston a \\"fucking nigger\\", prompting Howston to hit him. In anger, Davies attempts to attack Howston, and Howston finally cracks, killing Davies and ordering Anderson and Keller to stash his body outside. Afterwards, Howston goes missing, as does the girl as the remaining two attempt to make radio contact, Keller realizes that the voice he heard on the radio was that of Anderson when he makes the same radio call he had heard days prior. The pair plan to make a break for the rest of their group, but the girl appears briefly in the house and Keller goes to find her. Meanwhile, Anderson is confronted by the dead Wilcox who reveals himself to be a hideous creature. Before Anderson can react, however, he is killed by a shot to the head from the stalking Howston. Howston prowls the farm looking for Keller and is shocked when he comes across the same creature that Anderson had seen. His defenses lowered after running, Keller manages to gain the upper hand and slits the Sergeant's throat. Keller then encounters the Afghan girl, who turns out to be the Djinn, and manages to escape by throwing a grenade into the ammo-filled farmhouse. The following morning, Keller is grabbed by something from underneath the sand and pulled down, disappearing under the desert. The first scene then recaps, and after the commanding officer tells him that he will be returned to the United States, he leaves. Keller then looks toward the camera, his eyes turning black revealing he is in fact the Djinn. As the screen pans out to the desert again it is revealed to the audience that Keller is dead, half buried in the sand, his eyes removed and his mouth open wide in terror. The screen then goes dark, and the credits roll. CastProduction The film is not an official sequel to Dead Birds but was designed to be thematically similar. A third film, possibly set in the future, was discussed but was seen as unlikely due to financing difficulties. Release Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released Red Sands on DVD on February 24, 2009. Reception Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it a \\"lukewarm entry\\" in the military horror genre that is not as good as R-Point. Clark Douglas of DVD Verdict wrote that the concept would have been better realized as a 45-minute Masters of Horror episode. Justin Felix of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and also wrote that it should have been a short film.

A former amateur champion, he turned professional in 1970. His highest rank was komusubi. He wrestled for Tokitsukaze stable and took his shikona or fighting name from the head coach who recruited him, former ozeki Yutakayama Katsuo. After his retirement in 1981 he became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, and founded the Minato stable which he led from 1982 until 2010. He died of pancreatic cancer in 2020. Career He began sumo from a young age and became a high school yokozuna. He graduated in 1966 and then became an amateur champion at Tonodai University. He came from a poor family of farmers, and having to work to support himself as well as study, he had less time for training and did not win as many amateur titles as his rival at the time, Nihon University's Wajima Hiroshi. He had plans to become a teacher, but was persuaded to join the professional sport in March 1970, debuting in the third highest makushita division. His head coach at Tokitsukaze stable was ex-ōzeki Yutakayama Katsuo, also from Tonodai University. Wajima had joined professional sumo one tournament earlier, and such was the interest in their rivalry that when the two met in the jūryō division during the November 1970 tournament, sponsors placed kensho money on the bout, which normally is only allowed in the top division. He initially fought under his own surname of Nagahama, and continued to use it upon reaching the top division in November 1971, but in July 1972 he persuaded his stablemaster to let him use his old shikona of Yutakayama. He fought in the top division for 51 tournaments, earning three special prizes and earning eight gold stars for defeating yokozuna, including four from Wajima, his rival from his amateur days. He first reached the sanyaku ranks in September 1972 when he was promoted to komusubi. Although he was to hold the rank on two further occasions, he never managed a winning record there. Despite his success against several yokozuna he was never able to defeat Kitanoumi in the top division, losing to him 21 times in 21 matches.Yutakayama had two wins over Kitanoumi when both were ranked in jūryō. He also had a poor record against ozeki Takanohana, beating him only once in 22 matches. He did not miss a single bout in his career, fighting 996 consecutive matches. This is the second longest streak for former collegiate competitors, after Asanowaka's 1145. Retirement from sumo He retired in May 1981 and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Minato Oyakata. He founded Minato stable in 1982 and remained head coach there until 2010, when he passed control of the stable over to former maegashira Minatofuji, and took the name Tatsutagawa. He was also a Deputy Director of the Sumo Association. He reached the mandatory retirement age for elders of 65 in October 2012. Fighting style Yutakayama was a yotsu-sumo specialist who liked to fight on the mawashi or belt and his most common winning kimarite were yori-kiri (force out), tsuri-dashi (lift out) and uwatenage (overarm throw). Personal life and death He was married with two daughters. His stablemaster did not allow him to get married until he reached the jūryō division in September 1970. The wedding reception took place in October 1971. He died of pancreatic cancer on 19 September 2020 at the age of 72.

First published in 1727, his Treatise of Military Discipline was the most successful and widely used military drillbook to appear in English during the 18th century. It was reprinted nine times between 1727 to 1762, George Washington being among those who owned copies. He was twice Commander-in-Chief, Scotland, first from 1747 to 1751, then 1753 until 1756, when ill-health forced his retirement. He died in London in 1763. Life Modern-day Gordon House in London, built on Bland's original property Humphrey Bland was born in Lisburn circa 1686, second child of Thomas Bland; little is known of his mother, but his father's family settled in Ireland in 1670 and may have been related to the Bland baronets of Kippax in Yorkshire. He was the second of six children, including three sisters, Frances, Anne and Elizabeth. His elder brother John (died 1728) ended his career in 1715 as Colonel of the 2nd Dragoon Guards; after his retirement, he built Blandsfort in Abbeyleix, County Laois and died unmarried. William (died 1746) was a captain in the 8th Dragoons; he had five children, the eldest son John (1723-1789) inheriting Blandsfort. In 1755, Bland married Elizabeth Dalrymple (1732-1816), sister of the 5th Earl of Stair (1720-1789) and niece of Field Marshal John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1673-1747). He had no legitimate children but acknowledged paternity of Martha Maria Beresford (1746-ca 1800). After his retirement in 1756, he purchased Thistleworth House, in Isleworth, outside London, whose redesign was one of the earliest pieces of work by Scottish architect Robert Adam. As Gordon House, it was greatly expanded by the Earl of Kilmorey in 1868. He died here on 8 May 1763 and his property split between Martha, Elizabeth and his nephew, General Thomas Bland (died 1816). Career Almenar in 1710 During the War of the Spanish Succession in March 1704, Bland was commissioned as an ensign; Parliamentary accounts show he was Town Major or military administrator for Tortosa, in Catalonia from May to October 1707. In July 1709, he was promoted major in Colonel Frederick Sibourg's Regiment of Foot. This was one of five units raised in April 1705 from exiled French Huguenots. Sent to Spain, it suffered heavy casualties at the Siege of Alicante in 1709, where Sibourg was killed. Bland's brothers John and William also served with the regiment and all three fought at Almenar in 1710, where Humphrey was wounded. Despite this victory, the Allied war effort in Spain was winding down and it was increasingly difficult to replace losses; the regiment was disbanded in 1712 and Bland placed on half-pay. In 1715, he was reinstated as major in Honywood's Dragoons, a new regiment raised for the 1715 Jacobite Rising; he was closely connected to Sir Philip Honywood for the rest of his career. After the Battle of Preston, Bland was entrusted with escorting senior Jacobite prisoners to London. He transferred to the Royal Regiment of Dragoons in 1717 and promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd King's Own Horse in 1718. Bland fought at the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745, Cumberland's first battle Britain was at peace from 1715 to 1740 and promotion slow, but Bland made his reputation with the publication in 1727 of A Treatise of Military Discipline. A practical and clearly written work summarising the basic duties of regimental officers, it became the most successful and widely used English drill book of the 18th century and frequently reprinted. George Washington owned a copy and popularised its use with officers of the Virginia militia and later the Continental Army. Appointed colonel of the 36th Foot in 1737, he transferred to the 13th Dragoons in 1741 and was made Quartermaster-General to the Forces in 1742, a post he held until his death. During the War of the Austrian Succession, he served in the Low Countries, where he commanded the 3rd Dragoons and fought at Dettingen in June 1743. Technically an Allied victory, the battle has been described as 'a happy escape, rather than a great success' and is now chiefly remembered as the last time a ruling British monarch led troops in battle. It was also the first major action for the Duke of Cumberland, who replaced George Wade as commander in Europe. Bland became part of his small circle of trusted senior officers and commanded a cavalry brigade at Fontenoy in May 1745. In October, he was transferred to Scotland to help suppress the 1745 Jacobite Rising, fighting at Falkirk Muir in January 1746 and Culloden in April. Governor's House, Gibraltar; Bland's residence as Governor, 1751 to 1753 In early 1747, Bland returned to Europe, where he took part in the Battle of Lauffeld in July, a British defeat saved from disaster by a series of courageous cavalry charges. In September, he replaced the Earl of Albemarle as Commander-in-Chief, Scotland; as an Irish Presbyterian, Bland had little sympathy for the largely Episcopalian Jacobites or Highland culture in general. He worked closely with Lord Milton, a senior Scottish judge who advocated reforming the land tenure system to reduce the power of clan chiefs and introducing industry to improve the general economy. These ideas were summarised in a paper titled Proposals for civilising the Highlands; not all were carried out, but it shaped general policy. Bland also proposed re- establishing the network of military garrisons set up by Cromwell throughout Scotland, including detailed regulations for their relationships with the surrounding population, including education and intermarriage. This approach to 'converting' a hostile civilian populace was used by his colleague William Blakeney as governor of the Spanish island of Menorca and by Bland himself as Governor of Gibraltar. He has been described as a classic example of senior career soldiers in this period; a 'bluff, methodical, proficient general officer, who took his duties seriously.' He was appointed Governor of Gibraltar in 1749, a position that did not require residence and was considered a military backwater; however, he asked to be relieved of command in Scotland and moved there in 1751 due to ill-health. When Sir Philip Honywood died in 1752, he succeeded him as colonel of his former regiment, the 1st King's Dragoon Guards and also given the sinecure appointment of Governor of Edinburgh Castle. When George Churchill, his replacement in Scotland, died in 1753, he returned from Gibraltar for a second period as Commander-in-Chief before retiring in 1756. He died in London on 8 May 1763.

It stars Lisa Daniely, Hugh McDermott, and Richard Murdoch. Stanley Baker is seen in one of his early support roles. Plot A French girl named Lilli Marlene, working in her uncle's café in Benghazi, Libya, turns out to be the girl that the popular German wartime song Lili Marleen had been written for before the war, so both the British and the Germans try to use her for propaganda purposes - especially as it turns out that she can sing as well. The Germans try to snatch her at one point, but don't succeed, and she performs several times for the British troops and also appears in radio broadcasts to the USA, arranged by Steve, an American war correspondent embedded with the British Eighth Army, who eventually becomes her boyfriend. Later, the Germans successfully kidnap her in Cairo and she is taken to Berlin, where she is interrogated and repeatedly told that she had been tortured and brainwashed by the British to think that she was French, when she actually is German. Once the Germans think that she has been transformed into a loyal Nazi, they set her to make broadcasts in English for the Third Reich. Her old British friends, and especially Steve, are very disappointed in her. After the war, she reappears in London during a big reunion for members of the Eighth Army. She manages to convince Steve and a few of her other Eighth Army friends that she never betrayed the British; however, British security agents try to arrest her. Steve and another old friend, Berry, take off with her in their broadcasting van, chased by the security people. They drive to an address in London that she had been given by the German colonel in charge of her broadcasts, in case she ever went to London and was in need of help. When they get there, she finds that the German colonel lives in it. It turns out that he is actually a British intelligence officer who was working undercover in Berlin during the war. He informs them and the security people that Lilli was never a traitor, and that, in all her communications, there were encoded messages to the British intelligence services back in London. Once they know the truth, Steve and Berry take her back to the reunion, where everybody is told that Lilli never was a traitor. She sings the Lili Marleen song for all of them and afterwards she and Steve kiss.

Dramatists Play Service, INC: New York. 2000. Plot analysis In The Blood consists of two acts and nine scenes, and is of a linear plot style. While written in the twentieth century, the play follows standard playwriting rules of the nineteenth century. Well-made plays followed the formulas of Freytag's pyramid, which, according to David Rush, consists of seven parts for the plot structure.Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, Illinois. p. 39 The plot features the following: State of Equilibrium- Hester needs help raising her five bastard children, while in poverty. Inciting Incident- Amiga Gringa advises her to seek help from her children's fathers. Point of Attack of the Major Dramatic Question- Will Hester find help for her children? Rising Action- Hester finds that Reverend D. and Chilli, two fathers, may help her. Climax- Reverend D., her last hope, rejected her and called her a \\"slut.\\" Resolution- Out of anger, Hester kills her oldest son for calling her a \\"slut.\\" New State of Equilibrium- Hester is in jail, and can no longer help her children. Characters Guide Hester's Family= Hester, La Negrita- The main protagonist of the play, and mother of five bastard children. She struggles to find help from anyone for her children in poverty. Hester was involved with other characters that owe her money. She is shown as a person who is willing to give herself to others when they are in need, but, in return, she only receives pocket dollar bills. She attempts to work hard and make small profit, but becomes more influenced by her friend, Amiga Gringa. Though she tries her best to help her children, she winds up killing her son, and ends up in jail. Jabber- Hester's oldest son. He is thirteen years old and is considered slow by his mother, although knows how to read and write better than she. He still has bed-wetting problems. Jabber is Chilli's son, and could be considered Hester's favorite.Parks, Suzan-Lori. Dramatists Play Service, INC: New York. 2000. He is later killed for talking to his mother about the word \\"slut.\\" Bully- Hester's oldest daughter. She is twelve years old and considers herself a \\"good\\" person. Bully has more masculine characteristics, and in one scene, she compares the hairs of her private area with her brothers. Trouble- Hester's middle son. He is ten years-old and has a mischievous nature. He said that he found a police club on the street, but was chased by the police for it. Hester holds onto the club and uses it later against Jabber. Beauty- Hester's youngest daughter. She is seven years old and considered a snitch from her mother and Trouble. She ran away when Hester was beating Jabber to death. Baby- Hester's youngest son. He is two years old and the son of Reverend D. Character analysis Most of the characters in the play are in poverty and all affected by Hester's past. Also known as confessions, Hester has had many sexual experience with many characters in the play. Hester also presents her own thoughts near the end. one of the confessions that seems most evident is the Doctor's confession about how Hester had relations with him while he was in despair of being alone. The Welfare lady's confession entails that she has had more experience while having alone time with Hester. Reverend D's confession is how Hester's predicament turned him toward God. Chilli's confession is reflecting on young love and how times change. Finally, Hester's confession is about men's quick love and that she should have thousands of bad children.Parks, Suzan-Lori. Dramatists Play Service: New York. 2000. Genre The genre of In The Blood fits with classic tragedy, similar to Greek tragedy, unlike many of Suzan-Lori Parks' works that are usually drama.Schafer, Carol. \\"Suzan-Lori Parks's Venus, In the Blood, and Fucking A.\\" Comparative Drama. Vol. 42, No.2, Summer 2008. The play borrows elements from other classic genres, but not entirely of them. The characters are portrayed as either below or equal to us, as Hester plays the role of the tragic hero. She has the \\"tragic spirit\\", or hamartia, when she feels responsible for the troubles she has caused and can't help it.Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, Illinois. p. 107 Style The style of the play is based on realism. Elements such as the linear plot, immediate surroundings, character-driven story, and the objective point-of- view from the author connects to the element of realism.Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, Illinois. p. 191-203 Overall, the play has a representational form. The audience is not involved with the story, but to interpret what they are seeing.Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, Illinois. p. 202 Language The use of language in the play has different denotations and connotations for most characters.Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, Illinois. p. 79-82 Characters who are poorly educated, like Hester, Jabber, and Amiga Gringa use less complex words and syntax. The more educated characters like the Doctor and Reverend D. use a more formal language. Theme/Ideas The central theme of the play is about society's oppression of the people in poverty and those who take advantage of one another. Most of the characters who Hester's confides to taking advantage of her.Characters like the Doctor, Reverend, and Welfare already have homes and families, but don't put much effort into helping Hester and her children out of poverty. The meaning behind the title \\"In The Blood\\", is that Hester's own state of mind on how the adulterer, poor, and reckless person is in her blood. The idea of the hand of fate is symbolized by the eclipse, giving some implications that Hester's fate is inescapable and will live with the label she has in her blood.Schafer, Carol. \\"Suzan-Lori Parks's Venus, In the Blood, and Fucking A.\\" Comparative Drama. Vol. 42, No.2, Summer 2008. Spectacle The production of the play is very limited and sparse. The playwright had noted that the setting needed to reflect the poverty of the world.Parks, Suzan-Lori. Dramatists Play Service, INC: New York. 2000. Characters of the play interact very little with the scenery, but is shown to give the audience some sense of where this is happening. The audience is grabbed by the opening scene with the word \\"slut\\" written on the wall. Music The only song in the play appears in scene 7, called \\"The Looking Song.\\" The music and lyrics were written by Suzan-Lori Parks.Parks, Suzan-Lori.

Over his career, he has worked for various independent promotions, including Maryland Championship Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South, and Combat Zone Wrestling. In addition, he also made short appearances in Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Flash's exposure in CZW led him to get a few other promotions. For one instance, his participation in Steve Corino's Pennsylvania/Premier Wrestling Federation has seen him be matched up against The S.A.T. and Christopher Daniels (who he wrestled in the first round of the 2001 Legacy Cup Tournament), among others. Flash's most recent success outside of CZW has transpired in IWA Mid-South. Early career Becker started watching wrestling around five years old and began competing in amateur wrestling.

Half a month later on January 16 in Rostraver Township, Pennsylvania, Becker happened to be at an ECW show when it was realized that Sabu didn't have an opponent. As a result, officials managed to get Becker to do a quick jobbing for Sabu. Becker's next ECW appearance was on January 31, when he was scheduled to take on Big Dick Dudley, only to be attacked as he was walking to the ring by Taz. Taz then proceeded to assault Dick and his Dudley \\"brothers\\", Buh Buh Ray and D-Von, before cutting a promo in which he spoke harshly about then-rival Bam Bam Bigelow. Flash didn't work another ECW show for almost year, as his next and as it turned out, final appearance the promotion was on December 17 (almost the one-year anniversary of his ECW debut) when he served as the opponent of future- Baldies member Spanish Angel on a show in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

After working some tag team matches with his new tag team partner Danny Rose, Flash took part in the Cage of Death III show, which occurred on December 15, 2001, and served as the promotion's debut event at Viking Hall (the former ECW Arena). On that card, he captured the Iron Man Championship from Nick Berk in a three-way match that also included \\"Sick\\" Nick Mondo. On May 11, 2002, Flash lost the title to Mondo. However, Flash soon regained the title after he defeated Justice Pain on July 13 before losing it to The Messiah on October 12.

Later he would feud with Kaos in a Falls Count Anywhere Match, Early 2006/07 he would start a stable known a Pandora's Box with B.J. Whitmer and Pandora. =IWA Mid South= On August 2, 2003, Becker made his IWA Mid-South debut (the second night of the promotion's King of the Deathmatches Tournament Weekend doubleheader) by teaming with fellow CZW star Sonjay Dutt to win a triangle tag team match.

Six days before recapturing the championship, Half a month before Flash made his IWA-Mid South debut, he participated on the final MCW show ever, entitled \\"The Last Dance: The Shane Shamrock Memorial Cup.\\" The event came on July 16 and Flash who had consistently wrestled for MCW since mid-1998, lost his MEWF Cruiserweight Title to Michael \\"Crash Holly\\" Lockwood.

History Following the end of his former group, 1980s post-punk outfit Felt, Lawrence moved into different territory with Denim, a band whose brash teaming of glam rock with cutting and highly satirical lyrics was very much the opposite of his previous work. =Back in Denim= Denim debuted in 1992 with the album Back in Denim, a record which was both a revival (particularly with its glam rock influences and its mix of synth and guitar) and critique (in its satirical lyrics) of the 1970s music scene. A single, \\"Middle of the Road\\", was released from the album in January 1993 on Boy's Own Records. =Denim on Ice= Denim followed Back in Denim with the 1996 release of Denim on Ice, which was preceded by a single \\"It Fell Off the Back of a Lorry\\". Denim on Ice featured even more cutting lyrics with comment on the current state of music in England (\\"The Great Pub Rock Revival\\", a stinging attack on Britpop) and the realities of England's social malaise (\\"Glue & Smack\\" and \\"Council Houses\\"). The album earned Denim a support slot with Pulp who were fans of Lawrence and his work. =Novelty Rock= Denim's final release was Novelty Rock, a compilation of B-sides and some new material, which was released early 1997. =Denim Take Over= Denim Take Over was to be Denim's third studio album. It was shelved due to a lack of commercial success for the band, and when its lead single \\"Summer Smash\\", due to be issued in September 1997, was cancelled due to the death of Princess Diana, with EMI feeling any release would be in poor taste. However, some album's tracks were released on a subsequent Lawrence project, the 2005 Go Kart Mozart album Tearing Up the Album Chart, as well as a complete reworking for the next album On the Hot Dog Streets.

They were 30 people in August 1998. There was a rumor that Milosevic imported over 50,000 Chinese people and gave them Yugoslav passports so that they could vote for him in elections. Other rumors say that the Chinese arrived here in order to take language courses. The newspaper, Vecernje Novosti, says one part of town in particular has had a complete Chinese village transplanted into it: \\"The entire population of the Chinese village of Jincun, Kaihua County in Zhejiang province has moved to Belgrade, specifically to Blok 70 where they have businesses in the local center (Kineski centar, \\"Chinese center\\") in the suburb of Novi Beograd.\\" The Chinese send their children to schools in China when they have reached age for primary school, to learn the Chinese language like natives, something that is important for the community.

It lives in the Marquesas Islands and parts of the Indian Ocean, including the Seychelles, in association with a goby of the genus Amblyeleotris. The shrimp is transparent or white with prominent red markings. Description Alpheus randalli is a medium-sized snapping shrimp growing to about long. The rostrum of Alpheus randalli is half as long again as it is broad and the carapace is not laterally compressed. The chelipeds are asymmetric, one carrying a massive snapping claw. The background colour of this shrimp is white or transparent with red bands and spots on the rostrum and both large and small chelipeds. There are further bands of white and red on the abdomen and the tips of the uropods are red. The tips of the thoracic appendages are yellowish-green. Distribution Alpheus randalli was first described in 1981 from the Marquesas Islands in the Indian Ocean where it was found living at a depth of in association with a previously undescribed species of goby in the genus Amblyeleotris. This has now been given the name Randall's prawn goby (Amblyeleotris randalli). Biology The goby and shrimp share the same extensive burrow which the shrimp excavates in sandy or silty areas of the seabed. It has one or more openings, the positions of which are constantly changing as the shrimp engages in burrowing activities. During the day the goby rests on the burrow floor with its head by the opening or may emerge further. It feeds by picking small invertebrates out of the substrate that has been disturbed by the shrimp or by taking mouthfuls of sediment and extracting edible organisms and detritus. The shrimp is mainly a detritus feeder. The shrimp has poor sight and is alert to the actions of the goby. The shrimp is more vulnerable to predation and is quick to retreat to safety even when the danger level is low. If the fish swims into the burrow head first to escape more immediate danger, the shrimp darts in immediately. At night both retreat into the interior of the burrow and the entrances are sealed. The goby probably lays its eggs in a mass in the burrow as happens with other members of this genus. The shrimp lives singly in the burrow and at breeding time probably make an opening close to an adjoining burrow occupied by a shrimp of the opposite sex. The female shrimp carries her eggs under her abdomen.

Kay Gardella of the New York Daily News gave it a moderately positive review, though she commented that Strauss, as Kennedy, had done a better job of \\"imitating Jack Kennedy\\" than Sam Chew, the actor who had actually played the future president.Kay Gardella, \\"Peter Strauss stars in Kennedy drama\\", New York Daily News, reprinted in Boca Raton News, September 16, 1977.

King John VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 6 February 1818 Port of the Mineiros in Rio de Janeiro São Bento c. 1820 Several years after the Portuguese first explored Brazil, French traders in search of pau-brasil (a type of brazilwood) reached the rich area extending from the Cape Frio coast to the beaches and islands of Guanabara Bay, the economic and, above all, strategic importance of which was already well-known.f Overview Whaling in Rio de Janeiro possibly in 18th century In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique colony, which the French called Henriville in honor of Henry II of France. The Portuguese wanted to expel the French from that part of the South American coast which had been granted to them by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The task was given to Estácio de Sá, a nephew of Gov. Mem de Sá of Brazil, who in 1565 occupied the plain between Dog Face Hill (Morro Cara de Cão) and the Sugar Loaf and Urca mounts, thus laying the foundations of the future town of Rio de Janeiro. After two years (1565–67) of bloody battles, in which Estácio de Sá was killed and the French expelled, Mem de Sá chose a new site for the town, farther inland on the coast of the bay, at the top of the Hill of Rest (Morro do Descanso), or St. Januarius Hill (São Januário), later called the Castle Hill (Morro do Castelo). In 1568 the settlement was laid out in the form of a medieval citadel, protected by a bulwark and cannons. The surrounding fertile land, allotted to Portuguese settlers by the Portuguese king in enormous plots called sesmarias, was planted with sugarcane, which was to provide the colony with its main source of income. In 1660 the community became the seat of the government of the southern captaincies (Portuguese administrative units) of Brazil. In the second half of the 17th century, the captaincy population grew to 8,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom were probably African slaves and Indians. Military academy. At the beginning of the 18th century, Brazil began to engage in gold and diamond mining, which brought about remarkable changes in the colony's economy and stimulated a great migration from Europe, thereby increasing the number of people of European ancestry. The former village became a town of 24,000 in 1749. When the colonial capital was transferred from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro in 1763, the town expanded farther, far beyond its walls. The remains of the monumental Roman-style aqueduct Arcos da Lapa (Lapa Arches) built at this time still stand in the city. At the end of the 18th century, the town's economy, as well as that of the colony as a whole, was in a crisis because of the decline of the mines and competition from Central America for the world sugar market. In 1796 the value of exports from Rio's port was less than half of what it had been in 1760. Coffee production and the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1808 again brought prosperity to the colony. By 1815, when Brazil became a kingdom, Rio de Janeiro was large enough to accommodate a foreign population. At about that time the city's original appearance was being transformed; from 1808 to 1818 some 600 houses and 100 country houses were built and older buildings were restored. Many streets were lighted and paved, more land was reclaimed, new roads were opened, and new public fountains were installed. Among new institutions established were the Royal Press, the Royal Library, the Theatre of Saint John, the Academy of Fine Arts, the Botanical Garden, and the Bank of Brazil. When King John VI returned to Portugal in 1821, Rio had almost 113,000 inhabitants and 13,500 buildings, and the town had extended both northward and southward. A year later Brazil was independent.

Nobles and bourgeois moved their residences north to the São Cristóvão district. Merchants and English bankers chose to live around the Glória and Flamengo areas in the south, or they established their residences in the nearby Botafogo and Laranjeiras districts. The French, on the other hand, lived in country houses scattered in the Tijuca area farther westward. In that era, as Brazil expanded its world export trade in such products as coffee, cotton, sugar, and rubber, the city changed its appearance and the traces of its colonial past were effaced. In 1829 oxcart traffic was banned from the Rua do Ouvidor, then the city's most elegant street. In 1838 the first public transportation—horse-drawn buses—began to run to the districts of São Cristóvão, Engenho Velho, and Botafogo. In 1868 the first tramcars, also drawn by animals, were introduced. A steamboat service to Niterói began to operate in 1835. The first railroad was built in 1852 to Petrópolis, and a line reached Queimados in the Nova Iguaçú area in 1858. In 1854 gas replaced oil for street lighting, and wireless telegraphy was inaugurated. Sewerage was installed in 1864, and telephone service began in 1877. When Rio de Janeiro, which had formerly been the capital of the Empire of Brazil, became capital of the First Brazilian Republic in 1889, it was already a considerable community. At the time of the 1890 census, it had more than 520,000 inhabitants on 61 square miles (158 square km), ranking it as the largest city in Brazil and one of the larger cities in the world. The 1891 constitution designated it the Federal District. Rio in 1889. During the federal administration of Pres. Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves from 1902 to 1906, Rio de Janeiro was further transformed. A team of administrators and technicians drained swamps, cleared slums, paved and widened streets, and markedly improved health conditions, notably by reducing cases of yellow fever and smallpox. The central avenue (called Avenida Rio Branco from 1912) was opened during that period; Avenida Beira-Mar, running parallel to part of the south shore, was built on reclaimed land and several other important avenues were opened. The population of the Federal District exceeded 1,000,000 by 1920 and increased to 1,750,000 by 1940. During that period the number of industrial establishments in the Federal District nearly trebled. Castle Hill was demolished, land reclamation increased the area in the Centro, and the first skyscrapers appeared. Streetcar lines, now moved by electrical power, multiplied. While settlement spread on the east coast, some areas to the north lost status, such as São Cristóvão, which became an industrial and lower-class residential neighbourhood. In the mid-20th century, metropolitan Rio de Janeiro grew beyond its formerly narrow confines because of migration from other parts of Brazil, as well as a high rate of natural increase. The suburban population more than tripled to some 1.5 million between 1940 and 1960, at a time when the city proper exceeded 3.3 million. Following the transfer of the national capital to Brasília in 1960, Rio's rate of population growth slowed somewhat, although the suburban population continued to mushroom. By 1980 there were more than 5 million residents in the city and 3.6 million in the suburbs. Although subsequent growth continued at a lesser rate, by the early 21st century the metropolitan population exceeded 11 million, of which nearly half resided in the suburbs. Copacabana. Beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, population growth, real estate speculation, and an amplified dependence on automobiles precipitated a series of changes in the city. The highway system was expanded, with improved access to numerous suburban areas. Still higher skyscrapers arose in the Centro and larger residential towers increasingly replaced small apartment buildings and houses. Landowners, the industrial and the financial sector favoured the changes. However, higher rents forced many poorer residents to move from the centre to the periphery or to the rapidly expanding favelas on the steeper hillsides. Meanwhile, many affluent families settled in the southwest, notably in Ipanema and Leblon and at sites farther down the coast. Rio has maintained its status as the second largest manufacturing centre in Brazil, after São Paulo. In addition, Rio's service sector remains one of the strongest in the country, providing for increasing numbers of jobs in such areas as finance, communications, tourism and entertainment, public and private education, and computer engineering. Rio remains a major centre for cultural exhibitions and international conferences, and many of the more affluent and influential Brazilians keep homes there. Despite desperate conditions in the favelas, as well as high rates of violent crime throughout the city, grave levels of air and water pollution, and myriad other problems, Rio de Janeiro is still widely recognized as one of the world's most beautiful city.

Life Palmer was born in Canning Town, London on 19 November 1876. His father was a bare-knuckle champion of Essex, and rumour had it that his mother could take on and beat any woman in London’s East End. As a boxer, Palmer soon gained the nickname \\"Box o' Tricks\\", reflecting his showmanship - he and his brother had taken part in a stage act as children and Palmer utilised some of the things he had leaned on stage in the boxing ring.McKay, Jason, (2009), Box O’ Tricks – The Pedlar Palmer Story In 1893, Palmer won bouts advertised as the \\"World 100lb\\" title against Walter Croot and Mike Small, and became World Bantamweight Champion in 1895 when he beat Billy Plimmer of Birmingham on a 14th round foul. He boxed a draw with the World Featherweight Champion George Dixon in New York in 1896. He kept his bantamweight title through five defenses against Johnny Murphy, Ernie Stanton. Dave Sullivan, Billy Plimmer, and Billy Rochford. Palmer met Irish born American boxer Dave Sullivan in London on 18 October 1897 in what was billed as a World 116 pound Title Match. It would be Sullivan's first loss according to most sources.\\"Birthday of Dave Sullivan\\", The Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, pg. 13, 10 May 1919 Sullivan failed to receive the twenty round points decision, but established himself as the primary contender for the World Featherweight Title. Loss of World Bantamweight Title to Terry McGovern Palmer lost his title in Tuckahoe, New York in September 1899. He was knocked out in the first round by Terrible Terry McGovern - Palmer claimed that he had been blinded by the lights. Having held the Championship for four years, Palmer was still only 22 years old. Loss of the British Bantamweight Title In November 1900 Palmer lost the British bantamweight title to Harry Ware, and although he won two out of three fights with George Dixon and beat Digger Stanley, another world champion, he was twice beaten in British featherweight title fights by Ben Jordan and Joe Bowker. Jordan successfully defended the English Featherweight Title on 12 December 1904 against Palmer in an important bout at the National Sporting Club in London in a fifteen round points decision. Palmer was a heavy drinker. In April 1907 he killed Robert Croat on a train to Epsom races, for which crime he was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison. On his release he boxed again, but never enjoyed his earlier levels of success. For the last 20 years of his life he was a bookmaker in Brighton, where he died on 13 February 1949, aged 72.Boxing News Annual 1950, War Facts Press, p. 9 He is buried on the western edge of Brighton; the gravestone no longer stands.

Its structure is mostly 17th-century and it is a Grade I listed building.  History  The medieval settlement of Sheldon, first mentioned in 803, no longer exists, having been deserted by 1582; a 1976 survey confirmed its remains to lie to the rear of the Manor, which itself stands on the site of an older habitation known as \\"The Holloway\\". The manor of Sheldon was granted to Sir William de Beauvilain in about 1180; on his death, as a Norman, it was forfeit to The Crown as an escheat and then granted to the de Godarville family in 1231 by Henry III. In 1250 it passed to Sir Geoffrey Gascelyn on his marriage to Joan de Godarville. In 1424 the Manor was sold to Sir Walter Hungerford, and after some time was eventually granted to Catherine Parr temporarily until the Hungerford heir achieved majority. For many years, the property was tenanted until Sir Edward Hungerford sold the Manor in 1684 and in 1711 it was bought by William Norris, whose last survivor died in 1828. In 1854 it was bought by Sir Gabriel Goldney, whose son lived there until 1911, followed by the Bailey family. From 1917 the Manor was owned by the Gibbs family being Major Martin Anthony Gibbs (1916–1994), a former High Sheriff of Wiltshire, his wife Elsie Margaret Mary (1922-2012, née Hamilton- Dalrymple) and their six children. In 1982, Mrs Gibbs published a historical and architectural account of the Manor. 1896 Ordnance Survey map of Chippenham Withoutcourtesy Wiltshire County Council Libraries & Heritage The Manor is now within the civil parish of Chippenham Without; unbroken occupation since 1282 makes Sheldon Manor Wiltshire's longest continuously inhabited manor house. It was granted Grade I listed building status by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England in 1960. Architecture and antiques The earliest parts of the structure are thought to be a window on the west side and the porch, dating back to the late 13th century. Pevsner considered the porch to be \\"astounding, but much too big for the present house\\". Most of the main structure, consisting of two and a half storeys, and of rubble stone and stone-tiled roofs, dates to c. 1659 when it was built for a Mr Forster, although some parts are earlier. Later additions date to post-1711 and improvements to c. 1911. Interior of chapelcourtesy Dr Mike Sheldon ;External features There is a small stone chapel in the grounds, believed to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular tracery. After a long period of use as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built storehouse mounted on staddle stones to prevent incursion by rats. ;Antiques The Manor has collections of Nailsea glass, Persian saddlebags, porcelain and oak furniture, including an Elizabethan refectory table and chairs. There are paintings by Tissot, David Teniers and Bassano, vases by William de Morgan and \\"an unusual collection of glass walking sticks.\\"  Modern times  The Manor was the first winner of AA/NPI Historic House Awards, for its \\"architectural integrity and warm welcome\\"; its gardens, which are open to the public although the house itself is not, include a notable rose garden, ancient yews, an arboretum and mulberry bushes. It is a licensed venue for weddings and hosts summer productions of Shakespeare and operas in its grounds. It is also home to the Cleveland Bay Endeavour, a project to \\"conserve and promote\\" the Cleveland Bay horse, an endangered breed. The owners of the house were described in 1988 by The New York Times as \\"... provid[ing] that essential ingredient so many historic buildings lack: a sense of continuity with the past and the feeling that Sheldon Manor is still a living organism, not an ancient relic.\\" In 1995, the Manor was used as the location for Uppercross in the BBC production Persuasion and in 2008 for BBC One's Bonekickers.

He was the Green Party nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives, NY-26 district election in early 2011. Biography Murphy, a native of the Buffalo area, gained national attention in February 2011 for prank-calling Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker while claiming to be billionaire David Koch, and posting a recording of the conversation online. The conversation was said to reveal Walker's plots to defeat Democrats on a budget standoff and Walker's willingness to cooperate with wealthy donors to quash public sector labor unions. Shortly after the Koch prank, Murphy became the Green Party candidate in the New York's 26th congressional district special election to replace Republican Chris Lee who had resigned after sending a shirtless picture of himself to a woman on Craigslist. According to the Green Party of New York state, Murphy ran to challenge the \\"anti-worker, pro-war, pro-corporate, anti- environmental agenda of the Democrats and Republicans.\\" During the campaign, Murphy created a satirical website using the name of rival Republican candidate, Jane Corwin, in the URL. Murphy was excluded from participation in the televised candidate debates—in one case because he had previously insulted the debate moderator in one of his Buffalo Beast articles. The Green Party objected to the TV station's action saying it denied voters their First Amendment right to hear the views of all the candidates. Just 25 percent of registered voters turned out for the off-season election, despite national media attention. Democrat Kathy Hochul won, and Murphy finished last in the four-way race with about 1 percent of the vote. In July 2019, former staff at the Buffalo Beast reported that Murphy died. Controversy and criticisms In 2007 Murphy wrote a column which purported to be an undercover report from the Creation Museum entitled \\"Let There Be Retards\\". He drew the ire of conservatives with his May, 2008 editorial entitled, \\"Fuck the Troops\\". In February 2011 Murphy prank-called newly elected Wisconsin governor Scott Walker posing as David H. Koch, a wealthy Walker campaign contributor and funder of anti-union efforts in Wisconsin and other states. During the secretly recorded call, Walker discussed possible plans to trick absent Democratic lawmakers back to Wisconsin to obtain a quorum for the passage of the controversial anti-union legislation. Murphy posted the recording on The Beast, obtaining national attention, a cult hero's welcome at the Wisconsin protests and an appearance on MSNBC. The governor's office confirmed that the call occurred. Koch later told the conservative Weekly Standard he considered the prank call and posting of the secret recording comparable to identity theft. In late July 2011, Murphy was charged with disorderly conduct during an outdoor anti-gay marriage protest after he allegedly \\"directed a sex toy toward officers and told them that it was a microphone\\", according to the police report summary. Murphy later posted the actual charge which was \\"disrupting a religious service\\", and denied the charges saying he was arrested for filming the actions of police officers—with his camera being confiscated and erased.

It contains three short stories, titled \\"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot\\", \\"Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon\\", and \\"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades\\", as well as a preview of The Last Olympian. It is set between the fourth and fifth novels, The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian.

StoriesPercy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot= Percy Jackson saves Clarisse La Rue from feather- throwing birds in his school. After the fight, Clarisse admits that, as part of a ritual for the children of Ares, she must bring the Ares war chariot back to his temple on the Intrepid. But there is one problem: her immortal brothers, Phobos (representing fear) and Deimos (representing terror), who are the usual drivers and guardians of the chariot, became jealous and stole it from Clarisse. She knows she will be in trouble if she doesn't get it back by sundown. Percy offers his help, and Clarisse finally accepts it. They meet the two gods at a zoo. They fight them, who turn out to be extremely weak in battle (unlike the nature of Ares) once they discover how to counter the terror or fear, and are easily defeated. They bring the chariot to Ares' Temple on the Intrepid, an aircraft carrier that has since now become a museum. It takes place in between The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian. =Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon= Percy Jackson and Charles Beckendorf are on the same team for capture the flag. Beckendorf, a son of Hephaestus, has a somewhat awkward conversation about girls, and thinks Percy should ask Annabeth, daughter of Athena, to the Fourth of July fireworks, the biggest dating event of the summer at Camp Half-Blood, that night. Later, when Percy's capture the flag plan is established, he and Beckendorf try to sneak up to the enemies flag. Instead, they find the Ant Hill, where the dreaded Myrmekes (giant, blood-red ants) are carrying a bronze dragon head. Beckendorf, who believes this is a blessing from his father Hephaestus, runs up to them but gets captured. Meanwhile, Silena Beauregard (daughter of Aphrodite) and Annabeth surprise Percy. They laugh at the indiscretion of boys, without understanding the gravity of the situation. When Percy explains what happened to Beckendorf, Annabeth makes a plan to save Beckendorf: they must find the body of the bronze dragon head, to remake the huge bronze dragon that disappeared fifteen years ago from Camp Half-Blood. They manage to save Beckendorf just in time, while the dragon leads an assault on Ant Hill. But at the end, the dragon is badly wounded. Silena doesn't want it to die, insisting on the fact that it saved Beckendorf. They run away from the dragon, who now pursues them after an order of Beckendorf, and manage to paralyze it, so it becomes a giant statue. Suddenly, some Athena children find the group and take Percy and Beckendorf as their prisoners and congratulate Annabeth and Silena for trapping them. Percy is outraged and accuses Annabeth of having plotted everything, Annabeth defends herself by saying the whole dragon and Ant Hill thing was a coincidence. Before going off to finish the game, she tells Percy to come see her during the fireworks. The boys are forced to stay in prison while the girls go finish the game. =Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades= Rick Riordan wrote this short story for World Book Day 2009. It takes place between The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian. It seems to be part of the canon as a whole, as it was referenced in The House of Hades and The Lost Hero. Persephone calls Percy, Thalia and Nico, the children of the Big Three, into the Underworld to retrieve Hades' new sword from a demigod spy who stole it. The problem is that Hades' keys, which let anyone out or into the Underworld, are in it. Persephone gives them a flower to track the thief. When all of the petals fall off, the sword thief has made it out of the Underworld. Percy, Nico and Thalia must retrieve the sword before time runs out. They catch up with the thief, Ethan Nakamura, just as the last petal falls off the flower because Ethan has revived the Titan Iapetus. At the culmination of their fight, Percy flings Iapetus into the river Lethe, a river that erases memories. Only Percy's powers as the son of Poseidon can keep him dry. Percy tells the now mind-wiped Iapetus that his name is Bob and that they are friends. When the three heroes and \\"Bob\\" return to Hades and Persephone with the sword, Hades is very unhappy about the sword and leaves in anger, threatening Persephone never to disobey him again. By this, they know that Persephone commissioned the sword against Hades' orders. However, Percy saw a look of \\"hunger\\" in Hades' eyes while he stared at the sword. Camper Interviews The book contains fictional interviews with multiple characters at Camp Half-Blood. Those include the Stoll Brothers, Annabeth Chase, Percy Jackson, Grover Underwood, and Clarisse La Rue. Critical reception The book received mixed reviews. Publishers Weekly criticized it saying, \\"Bland illustrations depicting the contents of Annabeth's trunk, a map of Camp Half- Blood and a short 'sneak peek' at the book The Last Olympian pad the contents (barely) to book length; the inclusion of a crossword puzzle and a word search makes the book difficult to share. Not a must-read-but try telling that to rabid fans.\\" School Library Journal reviewer Tim Wadham commended the writing, saying, \\"Despite the fact that this is more of a marketing package than anything else, the quality of and interest in the three stories likely justifies its purchase.\\" See also *Fantasy *Greek gods *Greek mythology *Mount Olympus *Mythology *The Demigod Diaries ReferencesExternal links *Official UK Site Category:2009 short story collections Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:Percy Jackson & the Olympians ","title":"The Demigod Files"},{"id":"21752380","text":"Brega () is a genre of Brazilian popular music.

The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was an event that took place at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England, when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, attempted to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers. The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors, though they were less experienced and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved to the Little Theatre, Haymarket, though a few remained loyal. Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost all legal abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made an agreement with the actors that secured their return. Background alt=Black and white image of a man facing center. He is wearing a shoulder length whig, has an elaborate coat with a cloth around his neck. He has a hat under his left arm and both a glove and a watch in his left hand. He is holding up his right hand with the thumb and pointer pressed together. The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane was run by the holders of one of the two official licenses, or letters patent, established by Charles II in 1660. It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks. After Doggett died, Barton Booth took over his share.Styan 1996 p. 274 In 1730, a notice in the Daily Journal stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, Booth, in poor health, decided to sell half of his share to Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented his share to his son Theophilus, an actor.Hume 1988 pp. 142–144 The new management group had two members, Highmore and Ellys, who were incompetent and Theophilus Cibber was known to be both arrogant and volatile.Hume 1988 pp. 144 By the end of 1732, there were problems with the management of the theatre, which resulted in the failure of Charles Johnson's Caelia: or, The Perjured Lover on 4 December. The 8 March 1733 Grub-Street Journal seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre's management:Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 162–163 \\"how insufficient the present managers of Drury-lane playhouse are to discharge their trust, as directors of our public entertainments.\\"Battestin and Battestin 1993 qtd. p. 163 The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 163 Matters were complicated by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, reduced the number of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play The Miser, which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. The Miser was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, Deborah: or, a Wife for You All, lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's The Opera of Operas, Fielding's Tom Thumb set to music.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 163–167 Management changes Highmore and Ellys, both gentlemen and not actors, insisted on actively participating in every day-to-day decisions regarding scheduling, choice of plays, expenses, actors' behaviour.Koon 1986 p. 132 Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play The Harlot's Progress instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance from both the epidemic in London and other theatres attracting audiences with popular operatic performances. Theophilus's play The Mock-Officer failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 The Harlot's Progress, based on William Hogarth's painting of the same name, proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.Shevelow 2005 pp. 157–159 While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became interested in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot that took place in June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore,Koon 1986 p. 131 criticised the fact that he was kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped.Hume 1988 pp. 155–156 Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May. By this time, many of the partners, including Wilks, Ellys, and Colley Cibber, no longer wanted to be a part of the theatre and sought to sell their shares. When Colley sought to rent out his share to his son for 300 pounds a year, Highmore approached Colley in order to buy. News of Colley's selling of the shares to Highmore first appeared in the Daily Post of 27 March 1733. The sale price was around 3000 guineas and 3500 pounds. Theophilus was upset that his father sold the share to Highmore instead of continuing to rent it out to himself.Hume 1988 pp. 156–157 The share, as Theophilus believed, was his \\"Birthright\\".Battestin and Battestin 1993 qtd p. 167 Rebellion Theophilus first tried to work with Highmore and asked to run the operations of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half.Koon 1986 p. 134 Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.Hume 1988 p. 157 When the actors tried to rent the building, the remaining shareholders found out about it. They responded by refusing admittance to the actors. The building was shut down and no plays were performed.Hume 1988 p. 158 According to the Daily Post of 29 May 1733: > the Occasion we are inform'd was, that at Midnight on Saturday last several > Persons arm'd took Possession of the same, by Direction from some of the > Patentees, and lock'd up and barricado'd all the Doors and Entrances > thereunto, against the whole Company of his Majesty's Comedians, as also > against Mr. Cibber, jun. notwithstanding he had paid to one of the Patentees > several Hundred Pounds for one third Part of the Patent, Cloaths, Scenes, > &c.; and all Rights and Privileges thereunto annexed, for a certain Term not > yet expired.Hume 1988 qtd. p. 158 The actors petitioned Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the Lord Chamberlain, and requested that he settle the dispute, but he refused to involve himself in the matter. By early June, the actors had control of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave. The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property, but the court system was slow to respond. The management continued to cause problems for various actors, including Benjamin Griffin. Griffin was fired from the theatre on 4 June 1733.Shevelow 2006 p. 165 He responded in the Daily Post on 11 June 1733 with a history of the events since he first started in 1721 until his removal. He accused the management of bad treatment and wrote:Hume 1988 p. 161 > I could give the Publick a great many Instances of the Gentlemen's > Mismanagement and of Injuries done to the Company this Season in their > Direction. But when I affirm that they have no Experience, no Knowledge, no > Capacity, For Gathering together, Forming, Entertaining, Governing, > Privileging, and Keeping a Company of Comedians ... more than the being able > to purchase the Patent [...] it is a Truth that if any one does not now > believe, I am positive that they will in a very little Time be thoroughly > convinced of.Hume 1988 qtd. p. 161 Contemporary response Many of the local newspapers were quick to respond to the rebellion. An article in The Craftsman dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as \\"malecontent Players\\" who were busy in mutiny. On 7 June, the Grub- Street Journal stated, in an article by Musaeus, that Theophilus was selfish. Another article in the Grub-Street Journal, by Philo Dramaticus, attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are supposed to work. The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything they did was correct and that the actors had no reason to complain, especially over the treatment that they received.Hume 1988 p. 159 The actors responded later in June with A Letter from Theophilus Cibber, , To John Highmore, Esq. Within the response, Theophilus Cibber emphasised the inability of the management to effectively run the theatre, claimed that they were acting like tyrants, and alleged that they unjustly refused the offer by the actors to rent out the patent. This did not calm the dispute; instead, the Grub-Street Journal of 14 June 1733 printed parts of John Vanbrugh's Aesop, a play that criticised the actor rebellion that took place in 1695. On 26 June, the Grub-Street Journal in an article by Musaeus claimed that many of the problems that the actors complained about were caused by previous managers, who were also actors, and not by the current management that was composed of outsiders. Additionally, Musaeus claimed that actors in general were unfit to run the theatre.Hume 1988 pp. 159–162 A pamphlet titled An Impartial State of the Present Dispute Between the Patent and Players was published during the late summer that attacked the actors. It claimed that \\"all Men of Sense and Integrity seem to be entirely convinced that the Patentees of the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, have had great Injustice done them by the late Attempt of Part of their own Company to defraud them of their Property\\".Hume 1988 qtd p. 162 The actors responded in an article published in the Daily Journal of 26 September. Also during the summer, Edward Phillips produced The Stage-Mutineers, a play that started on 27 July and ran for twelve nights. The play made fun of actors, writers, and the management as a whole. Even though it was attacked in the Grub-Street Journal of 9 August, theatre historian Robert Hume described the play as \\"harmless stuff\\".Hume 1988 p. 162 Regardless, Fielding was personally mocked as Crambo, one of the characters within the play, and was offended by the portrayal.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 168 Reopening The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors. The majority of the rebellious actors joined the Little Theatre in Haymarket and started producing plays on 26 September. Although the Theatre Royal had replacement actors of a lesser talent and a few loyal experienced members, Henry Fielding joined the management's side of the dispute. Of the 15 loyal actors that stayed with the Theatre Royal, only a few, including Kitty Clive, Christiana Horton, William Mullart, and Charles Stoppelaer, were of note.Hume 1988 pp. 164–166 Reportedly, Highmore was losing 50–60 pounds a week.Koon 1986 p. 135 Victor, in his account of the time, wrote: > In this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; for a very > middling Company of Players could be expected to bring but thin losing > Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted > much better in the Haymarket. The unavoidable and melancholy Consequence of > this Proceeding was, that there was a Ballance every Saturday Morning in the > Office against the Manager, of Fifty or Sixty Pounds; and his Pride, as well > as his Honour, were too nearly concerned not to prudence the Deficiency > every Week with the utmost Exactness.Victor 1761 p. 19 In such conditions, Giffard sold his shares and turned over full control of the theatre to Highmore. Hill was brought in to work with the actors at Drury Lane by Autumn 1733, but the theatre was still declining by the end of the year.Hume 1988 pp. 166–168 Henry Fielding In order to aid the theatre, Fielding revised his The Author's Farce and The Intriguing Chambermaid.Hume 1988 p. 169 Fielding's The Miser was also put on 27 October 1733 with the King, the Queen, and many noble families in attendance. After this, Fielding produced The Universal Gallant: or, The Different Husbands, which didn't run until February 1735.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 168–169 20th-century theatre scholar Charles Woods believed that Fielding joined with the management of the Theatre Royal because they were \\"people whose legitimate investments were being jeopardized\\".Woods 1966 p. xiv Fielding later attacked Theophilus in a revised version of his The Author's Farce which ran on 15 January 1734. This caused a backlash upon him after the rebelling actors finally won in the dispute, and it was harder for him to stage plays.Hume 1988 p. 165 Theophilus, through his father, applied to the Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking to have a new license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and received a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.Hume 1988 pp. 173–176 A trial, in which the rebellious actors sued the management at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and they were to be granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.Hume 1988 pp. 176–180 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe. Henry Fielding: a Life.

It was the largest bank robbery in the Republic of Ireland's history. Criminals engaged in the tiger kidnapping of a junior bank employee, 24-year- old Shane Travers, and forced him to remove €7.6 million (US$9 million)7 arrested after Irish bank heist. International Herald Tribune. Published 1 March 2009. in cash from the bank as his girlfriend and two others were held hostage. Ireland's Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, criticised the bank for its failure to follow what he termed \\"established protocols\\" during the robbery, as the Irish police force, the Garda Síochána, was not informed of the incident until the money had been removed from the bank. A manhunt was under way for the perpetrators, with seven people being arrested and €1.8 million of the stolen cash located, scattered across Dublin, on 28 February. Robbery Clontarf Road railway station. Late on the night of 26 February, Travers, whose father is a member of the Garda Síochána based at Clontarf, Dublin, was alone watching television at the home of his girlfriend near Kilteel, County Kildare. The woman and her mother were out shopping together. When they arrived home with the five-year- old nephew of Travers, six heavily built masked men, dressed in black and carrying handguns, jumped from the bushes. The family was held overnight by the armed gang, during which time their mobile phones were confiscated and Travers' girlfriend was hit across the back of her head with a vase by one of the men. As dawn was arriving, the gang ordered all but Travers to enter their dark Volkswagen Golf family car. They were then bound together and driven to Ashbourne, County Meath. The bank employee was given a mobile phone, ordered to collect €20, €50, €100 and €200 bank notes from his workplace, and supplied with a photograph of the rest of the family at gunpoint to convince his colleagues that their lives were under threat. Travers drove to Dublin in his red Toyota Celica car, acquired the cash through the assistance of colleagues who viewed the photo, and carried the money out of the building in four laundry bags. He took it to Clontarf Road railway station, whereupon he surrendered the cash and his sports car to a waiting gang member. Travers then entered a garda station, the first point at which gardaí were notified that the robbery had taken place. One hour after this, the other family members succeeded in freeing themselves and walked to a nearby garda station. Travers' girlfriend required immediate medical treatment for a head wound she had received during a struggle with her captors, and the family were reported to be \\"traumatised\\" by their ordeal. Travers's car was later found burned out in an apartment block near Tolka House Pub in Glasnevin.  Reaction  Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Dermot Ahern said \\"proper procedures\\" were not followed during the course of the robbery, saying that gardaí should have been contacted before the money had left the bank. He also questioned how such a large sum of money could be taken as a result of one man being targeted. He has remarked, \\"Criminals are going for the line of least resistance, the human connection as it were. Given the fact there is so much detailed technology available to financial institutions, the line of least resistance is the human being.\\"Ahern 'very concerned' at how raid was carried out. Irish Times. Published 28 February 2009. The bank's chief executive, Richie Boucher, appointed just two days earlier, immediately wrote to all his staff to remind them that protocol should be followed in the event of future robberies, saying \\"Our priority is always for the safety and well-being of all staff. I am sure this incident will raise concerns. Our best defence is to follow tried and tested procedures. I would ask everybody to remind themselves of these procedures, which are there to protect you, your families and the bank.\\" The attack caused Charlie Flanagan, a Teachta Dála, to remark that \\"tiger kidnappings are taking place in Ireland ... at a rate of almost one per week.\\"7 Arrests After Ireland's Biggest Bank Heist. By Robert Mackey. The New York Times. Published 28 February 2009. Arrests €1.8 million of the stolen cash was recovered and seven people were arrested by gardaí in a number of incidents on 28 February. A house in Phibsboro was sealed off and ten more houses were searched. A total of five cars and one van were seized by gardaí.

Appletons' Dictionary of New York and Its Vicinity, D. Appleton & Co., 1879 The Underhill family owned the island through 1885, they sold it to Adrian G Iselin, who demolished most of the hotel. Iselin soon established the New Rochelle and Pelham Railroad Company and the New Rochelle Street Railway Company, making a connection to Neptune Island and the Glen Island ferry from the New Rochelle railroad depot. Along with the private steamboats operated to the island from New York City by Mr. Starin, the two companies greatly facilitated travel to and from the island by way of the New York and New Haven Railroad. Third Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, The State of New York, 1886 Marina at Neptune Island One section of the original hotel was left standing, and it was divided into four private houses that still remain at 1,2,3, and 4 Harbor Lane. Mr. Iselin later donated a large section of the island to the City of New Rochelle for a park.Park for New Rochelle, The New York Times, 1903 The Huguenot Yacht Club now occupies the western end of the island, and the ferry between Neptune and Glen Islands has been replaced by a large bascule bridge extending from the mainland, over the western end of Neptune Island, to Glen Island.

History Shrug formed following a couple of casual Friday night jam sessions in McClelland's girlfriend's room in Belmont Halls of Residence, the band decided to take things more seriously and began regular practices at \\"Stage 2000\\" rehearsal studios next to Dundee railway station. Their live debut took place within a matter of weeks at Dundee University Students' Association (DUSA), attracting a considerable crowd and receiving very positive reviews. The following cutting recently surfaced from \\"MacDougal\\", the DUSA newsletter (Christmas 1994 edition): The band continued rehearsals during their Christmas break at Morrison's family home in Belfast. Using equipment borrowed from The Dominoes (Morrison's father Bill Morrison's band), Shrug gained more live experience playing at local venues such as The Duke of York, The Front Page, Robinsons and The Bear in Holywood. On their return to Dundee they promptly recorded their first self funded demo, \\"The Yogurt vs Yogurt Debate\\", recouping some of the costs through sales to fellow students and sending copies out to an array of record labels across the country. Approximately 250 of these tapes were put together at the time, with cover artwork designed by Colin Maguire and an inner insert added by the band. Shrug continued to play gigs in and around Dundee and Belfast during 1995, and it was not long before they came to the attention of Jeepster records in London. They signed a five-year management contract with Jeepster who soon set about trying to get record company interest from some of the major labels. Also signed to Jeepster around this time was \\"Rhode Island\\", a Scottish act who would soon change their name to \\"Belle and Sebastian\\". With help from Jeepster, Shrug recorded two further demo tapes in 1995 and 1996, including an early version of what would become Snow Patrol's first single release, \\"Starfighter Pilot\\". Unlike the previous tape, however, these were not sold but instead distributed to record companies such as Sony Music Entertainment and Geffen Records. In addition, they began to play more high-profile gigs across Scotland and Northern Ireland. The band played a few gigs with another Northern Irish band, \\"Disraeli Gears\\" and Lightbody befriended their front man Paul Archer, his brother Iain Archer and drummer Jonny Quinn. Transition to Snow Patrol Around November 1996, as record company interest continued to grow, the band changed their name to Polar Bear to avoid potential legal complications with an American band that had claimed the name Shrug. A month later, Morrison suffered a breakdown. Richard Colburn from Belle and Sebastian filled in on drums until Jonny Quinn upped sticks, moving from Belfast to take Morrison's place in the band in Dundee. The band's first commercial release, \\"Starfighter Pilot\\" followed a few months later, and by 1998 they would be known as Snow Patrol. Recordings The Yogurt Vs.

She was the only child of Albert Schweitzer. Life and activism In 1917, Albert Schweitzer and his wife, the former Helene Bresslau, had been arrested as German citizens in French Equatorial Africa; the hospital that they had founded there in present-day Gabon in 1913 was closed and they were taken to a prison camp in France. Rhena Schweitzer was born in Strasbourg in Alsace- Lorraine in 1919 after the territory's post-World War I return to French control following 45 years as part of Germany. With his family still in Europe, Dr. Schweitzer went back to Africa in 1924, with occasional visits from his daughter and wife over the following two decades. She married Jean Eckert in 1939, whom she later divorced. In 1940, she was asked by her father to form the Albert Schweitzer Fellowship. She was trained as a medical technician and went to Africa to work at the hospital in Gabon. Following her father's death, she took over the operation of the hospital, remaining in that role until 1970. By the time of Miller's death, the hospital had grown to encompass 150 beds in 12 buildings, serving 35,000 patients annually. In the late 1960s, during the Nigerian Civil War, Miller took in Ibo children from Biafra into the hospital, and had 20 beds placed in her home when the hospital was full, with two children sleeping in each bed. She met David C. Miller, her second husband, at the hospital. Miller was a physician who had come to Gabon to perform a study on heart disease at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital and developed a close relationship with Dr. Schweitzer, caring for him at the time of his death in 1965. The couple were married in 1971.Noble, Holcomb C. \\"David C. Miller, 80, Physician And Colleague of Schweitzer\\", The New York Times, March 29, 1997. Accessed January 14, 2017.

After the Spanish Civil War, most armies, including the U.S. Army, realized that they needed tanks armed with cannons, not merely vehicles armed with machine guns,Zaloga (2008), pp. 4–5 and so the M1 became obsolete. Civil War veterans (wearing Grand Army of the Republic uniforms) inspect an M1 Combat Car at the 1939 World's Fair in New York History and development The National Defense Act of 1920 set tanks as the responsibility of the infantry and the general staff defined the purpose of tanks as the support of infantry units. Light tanks were defined as weighing five tons or less – so they could be carried by trucks – and medium tanks no greater than 15 tons to meet bridge weight limits. With very tight restrictions on spending, tank development in the U.S. was limited to a couple of test vehicles a year. The mechanization of the army was promoted by General Douglas MacArthur (Chief of Staff of the US Army) who believed that the cavalry should have tanks for an exploiting role rather than acting in support of the infantry.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 84. To allow U.S. Army cavalry units to be equipped with armored fighting vehicles, the tanks developed for the cavalry were designated \\"combat cars\\".The same loophole was used for Japan's Type 92 heavy armoured car, a light tank for the cavalry. In the mid-1930s, the Rock Island Arsenal built three experimental T2 light tanks inspired by the British Vickers 6-ton tank. At the same time, they built a light tank similar to the T2 for the cavalry – the T5 combat car. The only major difference between the two was that the T5 used vertical volute suspension while the T2 had leaf springs as on the Vickers. The T5 was developed further and the T5E2 was accepted for production as the \\"M1 combat car\\". The M1 entered service in 1937. A change to the suspension so that the idler wheel rested on the ground (\\"trailing\\") increased the length of track in contact with the ground and improved the ride. Together with a different engine and improved turret, this produced the M2 combat car. In 1940, the distinction between infantry and cavalry tank units disappeared with the establishment of the armored force to manage all tanks in the U.S. Army. The \\"combat car\\" name was superfluous, and the cavalry unit tanks redesignated the M1 combat car as the \\"light tank M1A1\\" and the M2 combat car as the \\"light tank M1A2\\". Service The M1 was fielded by the Philippines military early on in WW2 during the Philippines campaigns of 1941-1942 when armored vehicles of all manner were needed. All M1s that served subsequently fell to enemy Japanese forces. The M1 and M2 combat cars were not used in combat by the U.S. Army during World War II; though some were used for training purposes. Variants *M1 – The original variant. Eighty-nine built. *M1E2 – The prototype for the M1A1 *M1A1 – A new octagonal turret instead of a D-shaped one; increased distance between the wheel bogies; constant mesh gears; 17 were built in 1938. *M1A1E1 – Prototype of the M2 combat car. The engine was replaced by a Guiberson T-1020 diesel. *M2 – New Guiberson diesel engine and trailing idler. Thirty-four built.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 85.

It is one of the oldest bridges in Jamaica. History While it cannot be positively ascertained when this bridge was built, it was definitely constructed after 1724. Edward Long describes it in his History of Jamaica printed in 1774:Long, Edward History of Jamaica (London: Frank Cas & Co. Ltd.) 1970 When the bridge was being constructed, the sixteen plantations in the Bog Walk area were obliged to send one enslaved African in every fifty to work on the River Road, sometimes called Sixteen Mile Walk. Gravel, marl, lime, sand and stone had to be dug. Slaves often lost their lives as they performed dangerous tasks in the Gorge. Contracts for timber and for masons to work on the bridge were authorized at vestry meetings. Between 1881 and 1915, the floor of the bridge was washed away and later re-floored with iron girders and buckle plates taken from the original flooring of the May Pen bridge.“Historic Structures – Flat Bridge” in Jamaica Journal Vol. 16, No. 4, 1983 Today, the bridge of three spans is supported by two piers and two abutments. In the 1930s it had metal handrails and later wooden ones, but these were devoured by the river at different times. Hemispheres of stone are now the only protection on the bridge itself. Traffic Flat Bridge is a part of the busy A1 road and carries a single lane so traffic is managed by traffic lights. The bridge is often flooded after heavy rains. In such times, motorists are advised to take alternative routes through Barry and Sligoville.

On an individual level, he was the first Adventist missionary to Europe, although this was initially unknown by the Seventh-day Adventist church at the time, and J. N. Andrews was the first official Seventh-day Adventist missionary.  Biography  Background = Michael Czechowski was born in Poland and raised in the Roman Catholic Church, becoming a priest. He entered the Stopnica Monastery, but soon became disillusioned with the church, believing many of his fellow clergy to be corrupt. He was also in danger because he was involved with the Polish nationalism movement. He travelled to Rome, where in October 1844 he met with Pope Gregory XVI, hoping to strengthen his faith; however, the meeting further convinced him that the Catholic Church was corrupt. Czechowski left the Catholic priesthood in September 1850. He married the same year in Solothurn, Switzerland with Maria Virginia Delavouet; after which he worked as a bookbinder in Brussels. = Conversion = In London he became acquainted with the Baptists, who helped him secure passage to the United States. In 1852, he became an evangelist for the Baptists, and began working among the French Canadians of New York State. He discovered the Adventists in 1856, and at a camp meeting in Findlay, Ohio in 1857 joined the Adventist church. After conversion, Czechowski continued to work among the French Canadians in Quebec and New England, this time as an Adventist minister together with Daniel T. Bourdeau. In 1860, he moved to New York City, where he established a church in Brooklyn and worked among the French, Poles, Italians, Germans, and Swedish Americans. He published a book in 1862 about his experiences in Europe, entitled Thrilling and Instructive Developments.Land (2005), 76.Schwarz (2000), 87. = Conflict = However, Czechowski was not content with his ministry in New York, and attempted to persuade the newly organized Seventh- day Adventist Church to send him to Italy as a missionary, where he hoped to work among the descendants of the Waldensians in Northern Italy. He hoped to eventually spread his new faith to his native Poland. The church refused, because they believed that Czechowski was too new to the faith, was not very good with money, was unwilling to listen to authority, and was generally an unstable person.Schwarz (2000), 138.Knight (1999), 82.Land (2005), 76. Czechowski was not deterred. He travelled to Boston, where he met with the leaders of the Advent Christian Church, a first-day Adventist church, and got them to sponsor him as a missionary to Europe. He left in 1864 with his wife and an Advent Christian named Annie E. Butler.Schwarz (2000), 138-9.Knight (1999), 82. = Italy and Switzerland = Despite the fact that Czechowski had been sent by the Advent Christian Church, the message he preached was thoroughly Seventh-day Adventist, eventually causing the loss of his Advent Christian sponsorship in 1868. Czechowski spent the first year preaching in the Piedmont region of Italy. However, he was soon forced to move on to Switzerland because of local opposition. In Switzerland, he began publishing a paper entitled L'Evangile éternel, as well as religious tracts in French and German. In his teachings, he mainly focused on the seventh-day sabbath and the Adventist understanding of prophecy in the biblical books of Daniel and Revelation.Schwarz (2000), 139.Knight (1999), 82.Land (2005), 76. He founded a congregation in Tramelan, Switzerland with nearly 60 members, as well as many other smaller groups. However, he did not tell his church of the existence of Adventists of any branch, merely stating that his teachings came \\"from the Bible.\\" A Tramelan believer who visited Czechowski's home one day discovered a copy of the Review and Herald, and realized that Czechowski had been concealing the existence of other believers like them. The Tramelan congregation contacted the General Conference, and was invited to send a delegate to the General Conference session in 1869. This was hidden from Czechowski.Schwarz (2000), 139-40.Land (2005), 76-77. James Erzberger, a young theology student, was chosen as the delegate and sent to America. However, he arrived too late for the session. Despite this, the knowledge of the existence of the Swiss Adventists inspired the General Conference to establish the first Seventh-day Adventist missionary society to support overseas missions such as the Switzerland church; this society would later send the first official Seventh-day Adventist missionary, John Nevins Andrews, to Switzerland in 1874. As for James Erzberger, he stayed in America and became an ordained Seventh- day Adventist minister; then returned to Switzerland in 1870 to minister to the Tramelan church.Schwarz (2000), 139-40. = Romania = Czechowski became disturbed upon learning of the contacts between the Tramelan church and the Seventh-day Adventist church. As he was also suffering from financial problems at this time, he left Switzerland. He travelled through Germany and Hungary before eventually settling in Romania.Schwarz (2000), 140.Land (2005), 77. Czechowski worked for several years in Romania, where he was hampered by a lack of knowledge of Romanian. Despite this, Czechowski won 12 converts in Pitești, again without telling them of the knowledge of the Seventh-day Adventist church. One of these converts later made contact with J. N. Andrews in Switzerland.Schwarz (2000), 140.Land (2005), 77. = Death and significance = Czechowski died in a Vienna hospital on February 25, 1876.Schwarz (2000), 140. For many years after his death, he was a controversial figure in the Seventh-day Adventist church, likely a result of his going to the rival Advent Christian Church for sponsorship. According to J. N. Andrews, the missionary who followed Czechowski to Switzerland, Czechowski had caused \\"pain and sadness\\" to the people of God, and that the work of God had only progressed in spite of him.Schwarz (2000), 140. However, Czechowski's work can be said to have forced the Adventist movement to become an international one. The discovery of the Swiss church was the main impetus behind the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist missionary society, which led to the sending of Andrews to Europe, as well as many more to follow. Only in 1871 did Ellen G. White receive her first vision from God telling her to tell the church to expand internationally, and to send missionaries abroad.Schwarz (2000), 140-41.Knight (1999), 83-4. Thus Czechowski might be said to be the father of the Seventh- day Adventist church in Europe, as well as the father of Adventist missions.

Kellogg, starring Lana Turner, Robert Lansing, Celeste Holm, Robert Alda, Scott Hylands and Meredith Baxter-Birney in Panavision. Plot Michael Lewis and Patricia Peterson meet in an unusual way — while on a date with another woman, Michael attempts to retrieve his date's car keys from a fountain. When his date abandons him, he meets Patricia and they soon find themselves falling in love. After learning that she is pregnant, they decide to get married and hold a small ceremony in Canada, where Michael's family lives. Patricia's parents, Ben and Claire, have never met Michael, and are out of the country when the wedding takes place. They meet their new son-in-law after returning from their travels. While reviewing pictures from the wedding she missed, Claire is shocked to discover that she knows Michael's father; the two had a one-night stand after meeting at a USO dance years ago. This one-night stand resulted in Patricia's birth; making the newly married couple half-siblings, with a pregnancy already underway. Distraught over the news, Patricia goes to her doctor to see if she can obtain a late-term abortion. The doctor tells her that if the fetal weight is still low, they may be able to terminate the pregnancy due to her situation. Patricia ultimately decides not to go through with the abortion, but is still wary of her relationship with Michael. The couple spend the rest of the pregnancy isolated from their friends and family. Patricia's mother begs her to reconsider ending the pregnancy, or to go away and give the baby up for adoption, but Patricia reprimands her and says that doesn't want anymore family secrets. Michael also starts to research the history of incest, and its effects on people. While at home, Patricia goes into labor and has Michael take her to the hospital. She later gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Amy. When their daughter is six weeks old, Michael attempts to celebrate by cooking a nice dinner for himself and Patricia. But the evening quickly turns sour when Patricia becomes hysterical as she and Michael are kissing. The couple ultimately split up; with Michael moving out of the house and Patricia keeping Amy. As she later holds her daughter, a voice-over of Patricia rings out about how she and Michael could have happily stayed together for the rest of their lives had she not know that they were siblings.

Decision rules play an important role in the theory of statistics and economics, and are closely related to the concept of a strategy in game theory. In order to evaluate the usefulness of a decision rule, it is necessary to have a loss function detailing the outcome of each action under different states.  Formal definition  Given an observable random variable X over the probability space \\\\scriptstyle (\\\\mathcal{X},\\\\Sigma, P_\\\\theta), determined by a parameter θ ∈ Θ, and a set A of possible actions, a (deterministic) decision rule is a function δ : \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{X}→ A.  Examples of decision rules  * An estimator is a decision rule used for estimating a parameter. In this case the set of actions is the parameter space, and a loss function details the cost of the discrepancy between the true value of the parameter and the estimated value. For example, in a linear model with a single scalar parameter \\\\theta, the domain of \\\\theta may extend over \\\\mathcal{R} (all real numbers). An associated decision rule for estimating \\\\theta from some observed data might be, \\"choose the value of the \\\\theta, say \\\\hat{\\\\theta}, that minimizes the sum of squared error between some observed responses and responses predicted from the corresponding covariates given that you chose \\\\hat{\\\\theta}.\\" Thus, the cost function is the sum of squared error, and one would aim to minimize this cost. Once the cost function is defined, \\\\hat{\\\\theta} could be chosen, for instance, using some optimization algorithm. * Out of sample prediction in regression and classification models.

The brand has locations in twenty states and the District of Columbia. History The original Capital Grille was founded by Ned Grace, in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1990. The opening was curious for several reasons: the upscale steakhouse contrasted with the then-rundown downtown area of Providence, and the opening occurred amidst an ongoing recession. Grace envisioned the restaurant being popular with business and political elite, and proved to be accurate. Seven years after opening, the original location pulled in over $4 million in annual sales. Under the leadership of Grace's Bugaboo Creek Steak House Inc. (the name of Grace's other chain), the chain expanded to several major markets. By 1996, The Capital Grille had locations in Washington, D.C. and Boston. In 1997, aided by a $20 million credit line from two banks, it expanded with four more locations. Bugaboo Creek Steak House Inc. went public in 1994, and later changed its name to RARE Hospitality International, Inc.History of Rare Hospitality International According to The Washington Business Journal, the chain was acquired by Darden Restaurants as a \\"part of a $1.19 billion acquisition of RARE Hospitality in 2007\\". The Capital Grille operates under the Specialty Restaurant Group division of Darden. In March 2018, a spinoff restaurant called The Capital Burger was opened in Washington, DC. In January 2020, The Capital Burger opened their 2nd location in Reston, Virginia. Locations As of May 2019 there were 59 locations. Lawsuit In 2012, employees in five states filed lawsuits against the company alleging racial discrimination and wage violations. The lawsuit alleges that the company favored white workers over people of color for lucrative tipped jobs as well as requiring tipped workers to share their earnings with non-tipped workers. Thanksgiving controversy In 2013, the Capital Grille in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was open for Thanksgiving for the first time in its history. Capital Grille employees at the Pittsburgh location and members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center protested having to work on Thanksgiving without receiving holiday pay. In addition, the Pittsburgh City Council passed a Will of Council opposing Capital Grille's decision to force employees to work on Thanksgiving without holiday pay.

It starts with a summary of the general rules for the execution and structure of technical drawings. Further it describes basic conventions for lines, views, cuts and sections, and different types of engineering drawings, such as those for mechanical engineering, architecture, civil engineering, and shipbuilding. It is applicable to both manual and computer-based drawings, but it is not applicable to three-dimensional CAD models. The ISO 128 replaced the previous DIN 6 standard for drawings, projections and views, which was first published in 1922 and updated in 1950 and 1968. ISO 128 itself was first published in 1982, contained 15 pages and \\"specified the general principles of presentation to be applied to technical drawings following the orthographic projection methods\\".ISO 128 techstreet.com, 2009.)

Its last assignment was with the XIX Tactical Air Command, based at Brooks Field, Texas. It was inactivated on 25 December 1945.  History  Initially established as an Army Air Service World War I Aero Squadron in 1917. Performed flying training in Texas and did not deploy overseas. Demobilized in 1918. Re-activated in 1935 at Kelly Field, Texas as a light observation Squadron and supported Army forces at Fort Sam Houston as part of the Air Corps Advanced Flying School. = World War II = Reactivated at France Field, Canal Zone, and subordinated to Headquarters, Panama Canal Department, on 1 February 1940 as the dedicated observation unit for the command. The Squadron acquired the very first examples of the then modern North American O-47A when its complement of ten of these new aircraft were flight delivered down to Panama by Squadron personnel from San Antonio starting 14 June 1940. Also had a number of Northrop A-17s and with these, conducted its first six-ship night formation flight across the Isthmus to Albrook Field, then up the Pacific coast to Aguadulce Army Airfield. Then the flight continued on to the Atlantic coast and on home to France Field. In August, 1940, the Squadron started participating in the then-weekly tactical problems laid on by the 19th Composite Wing and, during one of these, acted as a scouting screen out to sea to \\"intercept\\" an expected in-coming flight of \\"enemy\\" bombers heading for the Panama Canal. Later that same month, now transitioned into their O-47's completely, the Squadron made an aerial tour of Central America, visiting every capital city in Central America except British Honduras. Training continued through the end of the year, and, on 20 November; the Squadron was subordinated directly to Headquarters, Panama Canal Department Air Force, rather than Department Headquarters itself as it had previously been assigned. The Squadron became attached to the 12th Pursuit Wing in February 1941. With the coming of war, the Squadron was still at France Field and on 25 February 1942 the unit was redesignated as the 39th Observation Squadron (Medium). By 3 March 1942, unit first-line strength had dropped to just six O-47A's, but two new Stinson O-49s had been added and, on the 7th, the unit was subordinated to the newly arrived 72d Observation Group, and moved to Howard Field on the 20th. Re-designated as the 39th Observation Squadron on 4 July 1942, the unit got ready for a major move to Waller Field in Trinidad, where it was attached after 6 August as a vital element of the Trinidad Sector & Base Command. By the end of the year, still nominally a part of the 72d Observation Group but detached in Trinidad. Following its arrival on Trinidad, the unit's aircraft were kept very busy Hying very low-level patrols around Trinidad and, occasionally, some of the other nearby islands in the Lesser Antilles, morning and night, with special instructions to keep a watch for possible German saboteur landing attempts. On 25 June 1943, the character of the unit changed significantly when it was redesignated as the 39th Reconnaissance Squadron and was assigned five Bell P-39N Airacobras. The Squadron had been assigned to the Antilles Air Command from 1 June. With the war now having essentially passed the Lesser Antilles by, the need for the Squadron quickly ebbed and, on 26 February 1944, the unit was relieved from the AAC and transferred back to the U.S. where it went on to become the 101st Photo Reconnaissance Squadron on 12 June 1944. Returned to its prewar training mission at Brooks Field until inactivated at the end of the war. = Operations and Decorations = * Combat Operations: Defense in Caribbean area, 1940–1944. * Campaigns: None. * Decorations: None. = Lineage = 39th Observation Squadron emblem * Organized as 39th Aero Squadron on 5 June 1917. : Redesignated Squadron A, Rich Field, Texas, on 14 July 1918. : Demobilized on 19 November 1918. * Reconstituted and consolidated (1933) with 39th School Squadron which was constituted on 6 February 1923.

It was based (though without any screen credit) on Fritz Leiber Jr.'s horror-fantasy novel Conjure Wife. Herbert L. Strock directed additional sequences for the film. Plot As in earlier film versions of Leiber's story such as Weird Woman (1944) and Night of the Eagle (1962), the story is set around a college campus where rivalries for various chairmanships of faculties take place. While the script's touch is notably lighter than in earlier film versions, verging on comedic in places, the story is basically the same. Several of the wives practice witchcraft in order to advance their husbands' careers. Joshua Lightman (Richard Benjamin) does not believe that his wife Margaret's spells and hocus-pocus have been helping her, and makes her cease practising witchcraft. Immediately things begin to go wrong for Lightman. He cuts himself shaving; he is accused by a male student of having accosted him (which loses him the chairmanship of the psychology department); and a disgruntled female student tries to kill him by sniping with a rifle from the college rooftop. Meanwhile, Vivian Cross (Lana Turner) is controlling several of the other wives via a sculpture of an egg (modeled on a demonic witches' egg they find in a book on witchcraft) in which a being is hatched. This winged creatures whose eyes shoot green flames chases Joshua's car and nearly kills him before Vivian destroys it via her magic. Vivian, who is close to death, then hatches a plot to trade bodies with Margaret. Margaret is sent driving off a pier in her car; but Joshua uses magic to save her. Vivian succeeds in swapping souls with Margaret, but the tables are turned on her; Vivian is destroyed and Margaret is returned to her own body and starts practicing witchcraft again to help Joshua.

The film was directed by Mel Damski. It was broadcast on NBC on January 27, 1992. Plot The plot involves the efforts of Mike Stone (newly promoted to Captain of Inspectors) to solve the murder of his old partner, Steve Keller. Since Keller is dead, the absence of the actor who played him in the series, Michael Douglas, who chose not to appear in the film, has a built-in explanation. At the same time, Stone is trying to decide which of two competing inspectors, Sarah Burns or David O'Connor, should take his place as the lieutenant in charge of Homicide.

The Journey of Jared Price was Black's first feature film. Plot Nineteen year old Jared (Corey Spears) arrives in Los Angeles from a small town in Georgia seeking a different life. When he arrives in L.A., he rents a room in a youth hostel that's furnished with bunk beds and already has one occupant, a male prostitute who needs to use their room to have sex with his clients some times. Jared of course doesn't like this arrangement but it's all he has at the moment. Jared finally lands a job as a sitter and caregiver to the blind Mrs. Haines (Rocki Cragg). He is hired by her son Matthew (Steve Tyler), who is a movie executive, because he wants someone to spend time with his mother so he won't have to. Jared meets Robert (Josh Jacobson) at the hostel. Robert is an openly gay teen who soon shows his attraction to Jared. Robert is very comfortable being gay, which leaves Jared feeling the opposite about his own sexual orientation. The film takes a further twist when Matthew asks Jared to move in with his mother, Mrs. Haines, so that he can also look after her at night. Because of the living situation at the hostel with his prostitute roommate, Jared agrees to move into Mrs. Haines' home. Soon after Jared moving in, it doesn't take long before Matthew gets Jared drunk and the two have sex. After Matthew decides not to give Jared a telephone message from Robert, and after Matthew fails to mention anything about his lover at home, Andrew (Bryan Shyne), to Jared, Jared is faced with a difficult decision.

Fryxell (April 27, 1900 - December 19, 1986) was an American educator, geologist and mountain climber, best known for his research and writing on the Teton Range of Wyoming. Upon the establishment of Grand Teton National Park in 1929, he was named the park’s first naturalist, a position he held for six summers. He was also an accomplished biographer, publishing works on several artists and explorers of the American West. Early years Fritiof Fryxell was born in Moline, Illinois to John and Sophie Fryxell, immigrants from Sweden. He attended Augustana College in nearby Rock Island, graduating in 1922 with majors in biology and English. He was a founding father of the Gamma Alpha Beta fraternity at Augustana College. Fryxell earned a Master's degree in English from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and then a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Chicago. His dissertation subject, mountain glaciation, took him to the West in 1924, where he fell in love with the Teton Mountains. He joined the faculty of Augustana in the fall of 1924. Tetons, p. vii.J. Robert Berg (Oct., 1992) Fritiof M. Fryxell: In His Footsteps (Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science .Vol. 95, No. 3/4 pp. 192-197 ) Life in the Tetons Beginning in 1926, Fryxell spent the next nine summers in and around the Teton Range, which at the time was inaccessible by train or automobile. During three summers of field work for his dissertation, Fryxell spent almost all his time in Jackson Hole, the valley in the eastern lee of the Tetons, studying the moraines and glacial outwash from the mountains. He camped out, carrying his tent, rations, and down-filled sleeping bag with him as he traversed the valley floor. After his appointment as park naturalist in 1929, he was finally able to explore the mountains themselves. On his rare days off, he would rise as early as two o'clock in the morning to begin his ascent. Nearly always exploring alone, he climbed previously untraveled canyons, discovered hidden lakes, and summitted many of the range’s peaks for the first time. Tetons, p. vii-ix. During the academic year, Fryxell worked at developing a geology curriculum at Augustana. When he completed his doctoral studies in 1929, the college appointed him the first chair of the new Department of Geology. Tetons, p. ix. Fryxell returned to Grand Teton National Park every summer through 1934. During this time he founded the park’s museum and developed an interpretive curriculum for visitors – still finding time to blaze new trails up the mountains and log new discoveries on each trip. Tetons, p. ix.  Writing  In 1935 Fryxell took a new summer position in Berkeley, California as geologist with the Museum Laboratories of the National Park Service. He brought with him years of notes and diaries that he had accumulated during his stays in Wyoming, and putting his degree in English to good work produced The Tetons: Interpretations of a Mountain Landscape (1938), a classic of Western nature literature that has been reprinted many times. Tetons, p. xiii. Over the rest of his career, Fryxell wrote several other scholarly books about the Tetons, glaciation, and topics of geological interest. In addition, he had a passion for preserving the history of the great Western explorers and artists who had spent time in the Tetons. Among his topics were mountain climber Billy Owen, artist Thomas Moran, photographer William Henry Jackson, and cartographer and geologist François E. Matthes. He also completed five volumes of Matthes's unfinished work. Tetons, back cover.  War service  Fritiof Fryxell served as Senior Geologist for the Philippines from 1939 to 1940. After the outbreak of World War II, while in the service of the Geological Military Unit, he played a crucial role in selecting landing sites in the South Pacific as well as Africa and Europe.

Péwé during USN Operation Deep Freeze, in 1957-58. *Fryxell Geology Museum at Augustana College, one of the largest sources of educational materials and specimens for students of geology, was named in his honor. Family Fritiof Fryxell wrote a manuscript biography of his father, an immigrant from Vättlösa Parish, near Götene in southern Sweden, but never tried to publish it. After his death The Story of John Fryxell was published by the Augustana Historical Society with an introduction by Ann Boaden. Fryxell's wife, Regina Holmén Fryxell, was an organist and music teacher with a doctorate and an education from the Juilliard School. She was also on the faculty at Augustana College and accompanied him on his trips to Wyoming. Fryxell's son, Roald, was a geologist and archaeologist.

The spin axis could be oriented to within 1–2° accuracy by the use of a magnetic attitude control device, consisting of 250 coils of wire wound around the outer surface of the spacecraft. The interaction between the induced magnetic field in the spacecraft and the earth's magnetic field provided the necessary torque for attitude control. The spacecraft functioned nominally until January 22, 1961. TIROS 2 was powered by 9,260 1-by-2-cm silicon solar cells. It had two independent television camera subsystems for taking pictures of cloud cover, plus a five-channel medium-resolution scanning radiometer and a two channel non-scanning low resolution radiometer for measuring radiation from the earth and its atmosphere.  Instruments  TIROS 2 added two infrared radiometers to TIROS 1 instruments, which allowed more analysis of frontal zones.

The film tells the story of a brilliant scientist who falls for his wife's high school art student and, using the technology from his research, figures out a way for them to be together. Plot Virgil is a 30-year-old scientist developing technology to permanently preserve human organs for transplantation. However, his obsession with his work takes a toll on his marriage. Virgil's only distraction is Emma, a 14-year-old student in his wife's high school art class. His sanity hangs in the balance as he struggles to suppress his taboo attraction to the girl. Virgil decides to use his experimental technology to freeze himself, in order to align his age with the young girl's. But his plan doesn't turn out the way he'd hoped.

Journalists can participate in an International press conference from anywhere without leaving their offices or their countries. They need only appear in front of a computer connected to the Internet via video link and ask their questions to the speaker by using a microphone to join the discussion. This concept was developed in October 2007 by WEBOconference, a videoconferencing service provider, and the PanAfrican Press Association (APPA) to allow African journalists to participate in international press conferences on the subject of development and good governance.  History  In 2008, the press videoconference service of the African Press Organization was used by the United-Nations Secretary General, Jean-Marie GUEHENNO, by General Director for Development of the European Commission, the President of the African Parliament, by the Head of communications of the African Development Bank, the Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union, by the United Nations Special Reporter on contemporary forms of racisms, the African Director of the United Nations for the development (PNUD), by the United Nations speaker for the Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs in Chad, the African Bureau of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or by the United-Nations Official Representative for children (UNICEF) in Tchad. In February 2009, the African Press Organization’s Secretary-General, Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard, has declared that his non-governmental organization was anticipating a significant increase in demands for international press videoconferences because of the global economics crisis which limits journalists in their ability to find time and resources to travel.

A., Rajshekhar K. P. & Madhaystha N. A. Patterns of Land Snail Distribution in the Western Ghats. Retrieved 1 March 2009. I. ampulla is the only species in the genus Indrella, however the animal color is polymorphic: the visible soft parts of the snail can be various colors, including red and pale yellow.  Shell description  A drawing of a shell of Indrella ampulla The shell of this species is like that of Vitrina, imperforate, with few whorls and with a very large aperture. The shell consists mainly of proteins with only small amounts of calcium carbonate. The shell is obliquely ovate and globose in shape and very thin. Half the thickness consists of epidermis, marked throughout with plicate line of growth, crossed by faint impressed spiral lines, and on the last whorl by shallow irregular furrows. The color of the shell is brownish olive, sometimes darker brown. Spire is small, convex and obtuse. The number of whorls is 3 and a half, rapidly increasing, the last much larger, rounded at the periphery and beneath. The aperture is very large, oblique, roundly oval, the same colour within as without, but smooth and glossy. The peristome is thin, membranaceous, columellar margin much curved inwards. The width of the shell is 38–63 mm. The height is 30 mm. The width of the aperture is 32 mm and the height of aperture is 30 mm. Blanford W. T. & Godwin-Austen H. H. 1908. The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Mollusca. Testacellidae and Zonitidae. Taylor & Francis, London, page 48–50.  Anatomy  The external soft parts are similar to those of Ariophanta, but larger, and not fully retractile within the shell. The mucous pore is of moderate size, there is no distinct overhanging lobe or a small one. The sole of the foot is undivided and very smooth. There are no shell-lobes. The dorsal lobes are well developed, the left divided into an anterior and a posterior part by a deep sinus. Kalc-sac small, receiving the vas deferens; retractor muscle attached to long straight caecum given off at the junction of the flagellum of the male organ. The spermatheca is oval, very short, on a short stem. The amatorial organ (the dart-sac) is stout and long. = Radula = The jaw is straight, with a slight convexity on the cutting-edge and no median projection. The radula is broad, with about 100 rows of teeth: 145 .17 .1 .17 .145; median tooth and the 17 on each side (admedians) long, broadly pointed, straight- sided, lateral cusps indistinct; laterals curved, aculeate, outer laterals bicuspid. = Color of the soft parts = \\"The animal, as represented in a drawing for which I am indebted to Sir Walter Elliot, is greenish yellow, but according to Col. Beddome it is black. It probably varies.\\" The color of soft parts has great color diversity, (color polymorphism) including white, cream, pale yellow, orange, red and black.  Distribution  This species occurs in the Western Ghats of India, specifically on the wetter western slopes of the Wynaad, Nilgiri, and Anaimalai Hills, at moderate elevations (3000 ft).  Habitat  This species lives in wet woodland, i.e. tropical rainforest.  Feeding habits  Indrella ampulla feeding on large fungi, at Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, Anamalai hills, Southern Western Ghats, India photo from wayanad ghats Colonel Richard Henry Beddome of the British Indian forest service found this snail feeding on large fungi.

It was created in the wake of Namibian independence in 1988 by a merger of several smaller parties and gained a seat in the Namibian Constituent Assembly. After also-ran results in 1994 and 1999 it ceased to be publicly active. History The FCN was formed in 1988 by a merger of several smaller parties: * Baster Kaptein Hans Diergaardt's Rehoboth Free Democratic Party * Democratic Action for Namas (DAN) * Liberated Democratic Party (LDP) * National Progressive Party (NPP) * United Liberation Movement (ULM) * Namibian People's Liberation Front (NPLF), which itself consisted of several smaller parties * Mburumba Kerina's NUDO Progressive Party (NUDO-PP) The FCN was led by Diergaardt until his death in 1998. After that, Kephes Conradie took over the leadership of the party.\\"Namibia: Registered Parties\\" . EISA.org.za. The party contested Namibia's legislative elections from 1989 to 1999. Electoral results In the 1989 election, FCN received 10,452 total votes, which allotted it one seat in the Namibian Constituent Assembly. In the former Coloured homeland, the party received twenty-nine percent of the total vote, less than the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance and SWAPO parties. This result, surprising as Diergaardt was Kaptein of the Rehoboth Basters at that time, was attributed to Diergaardt's secession plans for the territory around Rehoboth.\\"Chronology for Basters in Namibia\\".

The competition ran from 1888–1913 with three teams: Commonwealth, North United and YMC. Matches were played at the Walhalla Cricket Ground.  History  The competition began when two teams (Commonwealth and North United) played a game on the Walhalla Cricket Ground. They were later joined by YMC. Two teams would play on Saturday while the other team had a bye. These matches became soon one of the highlights of the week during the winter months. It is said that players would walk up the hill to the ground the night before a match so that by the time the spectators arrived the next day the players were rested and ready to play. This soon proved to be a weapon to all Walhalla teams.
