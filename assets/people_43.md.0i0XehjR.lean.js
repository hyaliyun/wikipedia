History The first public school in San Bruno, California, known as the \\"Old Tin School House,\\" was built on El Camino Real with volunteer labor. The first school year, 1906‚Äì07, saw an enrollment of 44 students. A bond election in 1907 raised $1,000 for the district. Edgemont Elementary School, a two-story structure was built on a large lot bounded by Elm, Acacia, and Jenevein avenues. The building also housed the district offices. With the completion of this building, in November 1910, the \\"Old Tin School House\\" served as a municipal building, known as Green Hall, and eventually became San Bruno's first city hall in 1914, when the city was incorporated.San Bruno Tin School House An additional elementary school, North Brae Elementary School, was opened in 1912. An annex was added to Edgemont Elementary School in the early 1930s to accommodate the rapidly growing school population in San Bruno.San Bruno Herald With the passage of the Field Act by the California legislature, following the devastating 1933 Long Beach earthquake, steps were taken to seismically upgrade existing schools or close them. However, the upgrading or closing of California's public schools took many years, since the State of California left funding to the districts. San Bruno's population increased to 3,610 in 1930 and exceeded 6,000 in 1940, encouraging the district to build another school. In 1941, the New Edgemont Elementary School was built a block west of the district's offices, at 875 W. Angus Avenue. Additional classrooms were added in 1946. New offices, a cafeteria (with a stage), and a kindergarten building (now the media center) were built in 1956. With the postwar building boom, more schools were built in San Bruno. The district's third school, El Crystal, was built on a small hill overlooking San Bruno City Park in 1948; it had additional classrooms added during the 1956‚Äì57 school year, when some students attending New Edgemont were bused to the school to relieve overcrowding at New Edgemont. Belle Air Elementary School was opened in 1951 in the lowlands of San Bruno, near Mills Field (renamed San Francisco International Airport in 1954). The district's first intermediate school, housing San Bruno's seventh and eighth grade students, was Parkside, which opened in 1954 on Niles Avenue. This school was expanded over the years. In 1973 gymnasiums, lockers, and showers were added at Parkside. With the development of the massive Rollingwood and Crestmoor subdivisions in western San Bruno in the 1950s, the district built additional elementary schools. The first of these, Rollingwood Elementary School, opened in 1956. Next came two schools in the Crestmoor district, both on Crestmoor Drive: Crestmoor Elementary School in 1957, followed by John Muir Elementary School in 1960 (named for the famous naturalist who lived for many years in Martinez, California). In late 1957, following damage to Edgemont Elementary School by the 1957 San Francisco earthquake on March 22, the school board decided to close the building, demolish it, and replace it with new classrooms and offices. With the completion of the new facility, New Edgemont Elementary School was renamed Decima Allen Elementary School, to honor a beloved librarian. Decima M. Allen was San Bruno's librarian from 1937 to 1955, overseeing the construction of the present main library next to the city hall in 1954; she also served on the school board for 25 years and was president of the Edgemont PTA. The district's final elementary school was Carl Sandburg Elementary School (named after Carl Sandburg), built in the Rollingwood district. At the official dedication of the school in December 1961, the famous poet and historian came for the ceremonies. As a San Bruno Herald reporter observed, Sandburg looked around at the school's children, smiled, and audibly marveled at their young faces. San Bruno Park School District website The school district also built another intermediate school, in Crestmoor Canyon, to honor former school superintendent Willard Engvall (1898‚Äì1983).rootsweb.com This school opened in 1962. Gymnasiums were added to both intermediate schools in 1973. Falling school enrollments in San Bruno in the 1970s and 1980s forced the school district to begin closing some of the schools. Eventually, North Brae Elementary School, Carl Sandburg Elementary School, and Engvall Intermediate School were closed. The buildings were later demolished and the land sold to developers.Eyewitness account by Robert E. Nylund In March 1996, the voters of San Bruno approved a $600,000 bond for seismic improvements to the schools. There was an education summit for all members of the community in March 1998. Then, in April 1998, the voters approved a $30 million bond for the renovation and modernization of the schools. During the 1999‚Äì2000 school year, the district began offering child care at each school. A state preschool program was begun at Belle Air in 2000. The Portola Elementary School, located in the city's northwestern corner, had long been part of the Laguna Salada School District, headquartered in Pacifica, California. Built in 1964, the school became part of the San Bruno Park Elementary School District in July 2000. In 2013, it was decided that Crestmoor Elementary School would be closed due to low attendance. In 2018, it was decided that El Crystal and Rollingwood would close, due to financial difficulties being experienced by the district.

Origins At the end of 1624, the Protestant stronghold of La Rochelle sent an expedition and besieged Port Louis in Brittany. As no troops were stationed in this province at this time, Louis XIII sent Marshal Bassompierre, which, from Angers, urged Baron du Plessis-Joigny, governor of this city, to create an infantry regiment. The Protestant expedition on Port-Louis was cancelled before the arrival of the newly raised regiment, but it victoriously took part to the siege of the rebellious city between 1627 and 1628. In May 1636 the regiment received the name of Touraine and its regimental flags. During the Fronde the colonels took advantage of the weakening of royal authority and did away with the provincial title of their regiments. Subsequently, the Touraine regiment appeared as the R√©giment d'Amboise, de Kercado or de Chambellay according to the name of its colonel. Franco-Spanish War During the Franco-Spanish War, the Regiment de Touraine participated to the Italian campaign where it successfully attacked Spanish possessions in Northern Italy, including Ceva, Pianezza, Mondov√¨ and took part to the famous siege of Turin. Franco-Dutch War and War of the Reunions After Turenne's death, the regiment participated to the siege of Valenciennes (1676-1677) the Battle of Cassel (1677) and the Siege of Luxembourg (1684). Nine Years War War of the Spanish Succession War of the Polish Succession War of the Austrian Succession The regiment was present at the battle of Fontenoy 1745 and the sieges of Tournai, Termonde and Ath. In 1746 it fought at the battle of Rocoux and the siege of Namur. In 1747 it was at the battle of Lauffeld and participated at the siege of Bergen op Zoom. It was at the siege of Maastricht in 1748.Susane, Louis, Histoire de l'infanterie fran√ßaise, Volume 3, Paris, 1876, pp.375‚Äì376. Seven Years' War In 1757 Touraine fought at battle of Hastenbeck. It was at the battle of Krefeld in 1758. The regiment was present at the battle of Minden in 1759 and the siege of M«önster. It fought at Warburg in 1760, covering the retreat of the army.Susane, Louis, Histoire de l'infanterie fran√ßaise, Volume 3, Paris, 1876, pp.376‚Äì377. American Revolutionary War The regiment, commanded by Vicomte de Poudeux, was among forces under Saint Simon brought from the West Indies to Yorktown. R√©giment de Touraine principal engagements: Yorktown ; St Christophe ; Les Saintes. French Revolution In 1791, the provincial names of the French regiments were abolished and a number was assigned to each of them. Thus the regiment of Touraine became the 33rd line infantry regiment.

The route heads northeast and forms a concurrency with U.S. Route 322 (US 322) before heading to Lebanon. The route follows part of Legislative Route 280, which was designated in 1911. PA 241 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 441 in Marietta north to PA 72 in Lebanon, heading north to Maytown and west to Bainbridge before continuing northeast along its current alignment. The southern terminus was cut back to PA 340 (now PA 743) in Maytown in the 1930s, with the route south of there replaced by PA 340. The northern terminus was cut back slightly in the 1950s following a rerouting of PA 72. In 1961, the south end of PA 241 was moved to its current location. Route description PA 241 northbound past PA 743 in Elizabethtown PA 241 begins at an intersection with PA 441 north of the community of Bainbridge in Conoy Township, Lancaster County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Bainbridge Road. The road heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, crossing into West Donegal Township. The route continues through agricultural areas before it passes to the east of the large Masonic Village retirement community. PA 241 heads into the borough of Elizabethtown and becomes West Bainbridge Street, soon turning northwest onto Masonic Drive. The route heads through commercial areas a short distance to the southwest of Amtrak's Keystone Corridor before passing between Masonic Village to the south and Elizabethtown station along the Amtrak line to the north. PA 241 turns north onto West High Street and passes under the Amtrak line. The road curves northeast and crosses a railroad spur from the Amtrak line at-grade as it heads through residential areas prior to coming to an intersection with PA 230/PA 743 in the commercial downtown. Here, PA 241 turns north to form a concurrency with PA 230 and PA 743 on North Market Street. The road leaves the downtown and enters residential areas, with PA 241 and PA 743 splitting from PA 230 by briefly heading northeast on Linden Avenue. PA 241 and PA 743 turn north onto North Hanover Street a short distance later, passing a mix of homes and businesses as it crosses into Mount Joy Township and becomes Hershey Road. PA 241 splits from PA 743 by heading northeast onto Mt. Gretna Road, heading through wooded residential areas before coming to a bridge over the PA 283 freeway. The road continues through rural residential areas with woods to the northwest and farms to the southeast before winding north through forests. The route curves northeast and runs through a mix of farm fields and woods with some homes, passing through the community of Bellaire. PA 241 enters South Londonderry Township in Lebanon County, where the name changes to Elizabethtown Road. The road continues northeast through farmland with some homes and comes to a bridge under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76).

PA 241 continues through rural areas, with the Lebanon Valley Rail Trail and Conewago Creek parallel to the northwest of the road, and crosses the trail and creek before it reaches a junction with the eastern terminus of PA 341. Here, the route runs through a mix of fields, woods, and homes before it crosses the Conewago Creek again and comes to an intersection with PA 117 in the community of Colebrook. At this point, PA 241 turns north for a concurrency with PA 117 along Mt. Wilson Road, and the two routes head northwest across the creek and through farm fields. PA 117 splits to the west and PA 241 continues northeast through forested areas with some homes, crossing into South Annville Township. The road passes to the south of an industrial complex before it continues through forests, curving to the north. The route heads east and enters the agricultural Lebanon Valley, where it turns to the north. The road continues through farmland with some homes before it reaches a junction with US 322 near Fontana. Here, PA 241 turns east for a concurrency with US 322 along Horseshoe Pike, soon intersecting the southern terminus of PA 934. The road continues east through agricultural areas, entering West Cornwall Township, before PA 241 splits from US 322 by turning north onto Colebrook Road. The route enters North Cornwall Township and curves northeast as it continues through farmland with some residential development. The road winds northeast through rural land and passes through the community of Rocherty before it runs through a mix of farms and residential and commercial development. The route continues past homes and crosses into the city of Lebanon, where it becomes city-maintained. A short distance later, PA 241 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 72. History When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, the current routing of PA 241 was designated as part of Legislative Route 280, which continued southeast from Bainbridge to Columbia. By 1926, the roadway between Elizabethtown and Lebanon was paved while the road southwest from Elizabethtown to Bainbridge was unpaved. PA 241 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 441 in Marietta north to PA 72 in Lebanon. The route followed Maytown Road north to Maytown, Stackstown Road west to Bainbridge, and PA 441 northwest before it continued northeast along its current alignment to Lebanon and north along Quentin Road to end at PA 72 at Cornwall Road. The entire length of route was paved by 1930. In the 1930s, the southern terminus of PA 241 was cut back to PA 340 (now PA 743) in Maytown, with PA 340 replacing the route between Marietta and Maytown. The northern terminus was moved to its current location in the 1950s following the rerouting of PA 72 to Quentin Road. The southern terminus of the route was cut back to its current location at PA 441 near Bainbridge in 1961. Major intersections PA 241 Truck Pennsylvania Route 241 Truck is an unsigned truck route marked with a red arrow that bypasses a weight restricted bridge over the Conoy Creek, on which trucks over 27 tons and combination loads over 32 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 441 and PA 743 through Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The route was established in 2013.

Biography  Unzaga was born in M√°laga, Spain, the son of a well- known Basque family. He served in the Italian war of 1735 and went to Havana in 1740, where he was appointed lieutenant governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba and later of Santiago de Cuba. During the Seven Years' War he defended Havana against a British siege, in 1762. Unzaga accompanied Alejandro O'Reilly to New Orleans in 1769 to put down the Rebellion of 1768 by French and German colonists objecting to the cessation of Louisiana to Spain via the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). Following the formal establishment of the cabildo (council), Unzaga became governor on December 1, 1769.Spanish Governors of Louisiana: Luis Unzaga Y Amezaga In 1775, he married Marie Elizabeth de St. Maxent, first daughter of Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, the wealthiest man in Louisiana. Unzaga was noted for allowing open trade. During the summer of 1776, he secretly helped the Americans by privately delivering five tons of gunpowder from the king's stores to Captain George Gibson and Lieutenant Linn of the Virginia Council of Defense. The gunpowder moved up the Mississippi under the protection of the flag of Spain and was used to thwart British plans to capture Fort Pitt. From June 17, 1777, to December 10, 1782, Unzaga served as Captain General of Venezuela. In 1783 he became governor of Cuba, where one of his first actions was ordering a halt to the unrestrained cutting of cedar trees.

Heinlein, and manga artists, such as Yukinobu Hoshino and his manga Sabertooth Tiger, which had inspired him to create manga. He has also cited Tetsuya Chiba and his manga among his inspirations. Soon after graduating, he wrote numerous d≈çjinshi and was an assistant to numerous manga artists, prior to making his debut as a professional manga artist. In 1986, Tsuruta made his professional debut, authoring his first manga series, the short work, , which was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Morning seinen magazine, set in a world where the land was sinking into water. Tsuruta has cited that the inspiration to this debut work of his came during a train journey from Tokyo to the ocean at Odawara, during which he had seen numerous rice paddies and thought of the possibility of a train line passing through the ocean, after which he wanted to create a work where he could use this image. Soon after, Tsuruta authored Spirit of Wonder, among his most famous works, in which he applied many of his inspirations, which was serialized in Kodansha's seinen magazines Weekly Morning and Afternoon between 1987 and 1996, and was later adapted into an anime series. After Spirit of Wonder, Tsuruta wrote short manga works, and also illustrated numerous art books, which were quite successful. In 2002, he provided the character designs for the anime series Abenobashi Mah≈ç Sh≈çtengai and also illustrated its manga adaptation. In 2000 and 2001, Tsuruta received the 31st and 32nd Seiun Awards for outstanding artist of the year. He has also received the Hayakawa Award for best illustrator, in 2000.

He was also a grandson of King Ae√´tes of Colchis . Phrontis and his brothers were raised in Colchis, but after their father died, he and his brothers set out to avenge their father‚Äôs ill treatment in the hands of king Athamas of Orchomenus and were stranded on the Island of Ares the War God in the Black Sea until they were rescued from the island by Jason and the Argonauts. Once Jason received discovered that Phrontis and his brothers were grandsons of King Ae√´tes of Colchis, Jason convinced Phrontis and his brothers to return with him to Colchis and help him to obtain the Golden Fleece. Jason also questioned Phrontis and his brothers on the layout and security of the land. After the Fleece was retrieved from Colchis, Phrontis and his brothers returned with the Argo's crew to Greece. His brothers were Cytissorus, Argus and Melas, and, according to some accounts, Presbon was another one of his brothers. Another story of Phrontis transpired many years after the Argonautical travels and involves Phrontis' brother Melas as a traveling merchant who was apprehended and kept in captivity by the oppressive king Talycrates (Œ§Œ±ŒªœÖŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒ∑œÇ) of the city of Ionetrea (ŒôŒøŒΩŒ∑œÑœÅŒµŒπŒ±) in the Caucasus along the Cyrus River. Many other traveling merchants who journeyed through the Caucasus were held in captivity as well. Talycrates hoped that, by holding captive as many merchants from Greece and Anatolia as possible, he could economically weaken the wealthy city-states in those regions, giving him a great advantage of conquest. Once Phrontis received word of his brother's captivity, he felt compelled to travel the long journey to rescue his brother. Phrontis prayed to Zeus for help and Zeus gave Phrontis' horse Tempestris the wings of an eagle (Zeus' sacred animal), enabling the horse to fly over the high Caucasus Mountains and carry Phrontis safely to Ionetrea. After arriving at Ionetrea, Phrontis freed his brother Melas, and many other Greek and Anatolian traveling merchants, from prison bonds. Afterward he helped the inhabitants of Ionetrea to revolt and to overthrow and kill Talycrates, thus liberating the Ionetreans from his tyrannical oppression. An Ionetrean maiden named Lystra joined Phrontis and Melas on the journey back to Greece, and Phrontis married Lystra in Greece.

Mary's husband, Harry Craig, a Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, native, was nicknamed Bosco. Soon after Georgiana's birth, Mary abandoned the child to return to her husband overseas, leaving Georgiana to travel from relative to relative. They returned in 1911 to meet their three-year-old daughter but then departed for Europe again, moving on to India when the war broke out. At that time, Georgiana found a permanent home in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, where she lived with her paternal aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Elton Rice, at 607 South Main St. The Rices raised Georgiana. Elton Rice has been credited with stirring her interest in mysteries by reading her the poems and stories of Edgar Allan Poe.  Writing career  Craig Rice‚Äôs first steps in publishing were as a writer for The Milwaukee Journal and The Chicago American. In 1930-31 she started working for radio stations, first WCLO and then the Beacon Syndicate in 1931. Her first fictional character, Professor Silvernail, was created for WCLO Syndicate Serials (1933).Ellett, Ryan. Radio Drama and Comedy Writers, 1928‚Äì1962. Jefferson, NC: MacFarland, 2017, p. 166. For a number of years she tried unsuccessfully to write novels, poetry and music, but it was not until her first story of John J. Malone, which she published under her birth surname and adopted surname Craig Rice, that she enjoyed some hard-won success.\\"Haining, Peter, ed. The Television Crimebusters Omnibus. London: Orion, 1994, p. 94. Gritty but humorous, Rice's stories uniquely combine the hard-boiled detective tradition with no-holds-barred, screwball comedy. Most of her output features a memorable trio of protagonists: Jake Justus, a handsome but none-too-bright press agent with his heart in the right place; Helene Brand, a rich heiress and hard-drinking party animal par excellence (to become Mrs. Justus in the later novels); and John Joseph Malone, a hard- drinking small-time lawyer (though both his cryptic conversation and sartorial habits are more reminiscent of such official or private gumshoes as Lieutenant Columbo). Against the odds and often apparently more by luck than skill, these three manage to solve crimes whose details are often burlesque and surreal, sometimes to the point of Grand Guignol, and all involving the perpetually exasperated Captain Daniel Von Flanagan of the Homicide Squad. A few stories feature the team of Bingo Riggs and Handsome Kusak, small-time grifters who become involved in criminal situations and have to dig themselves free by solving the mystery. Craig Rice also ghostwrote for George Sanders.Hubin, Allen J. Crime Fiction, 1749-1980: A Comprehensive Bibliography. New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1984, p. 243 Because of their friendship, many fans assumed that Rice ghostwrote the two wildly popular mysteries by Gypsy Rose Lee. \\"While the collaboration with Gypsy is often reported,\\" J.F. Norris writes, \\"in the recently published and thoroughly well researched biography of Gypsy Rose Lee (Stripping Gypsy: The Life of Gypsy Rose Lee, Oxford University Press, 2009) [author Noralee Frankel makes it clear] that Craig Rice DID NOT write either of Lee's comic mystery novels. This is supported with correspondence between Lee and Rice. Rice did, however, help craft the screenplay for The G String Murders which became the Barbara Stanwyck vehicle Lady of Burlesque.\\" Her association with Sanders came about as a result of her work on the screenplays of two of The Falcon movies, The Falcon's Brother (1942, Sanders's final outing as The Falcon) and The Falcon in Danger (1943, when Sanders's brother Tom Conway had taken over the role). She collaborated with fellow mystery writer Stuart Palmer on screenplays and short stories and with Ed McBain on a novel for which she furnished the principal characters, Bingo Riggs and Handsome Kusak. (The \\"collaboration\\" with McBain is a \\"posthumous collaboration in which McBain completed an unfinished book begun by Rice. In a foreword to at least one edition of the book, McBain wrote that the book was essentially half-finished in first draft, but there were no notes as to how she had intended to continue it, so that he had to solve the mystery himself before completing the manuscript.) Time Magazine On January 28, 1946, Craig Rice appeared on the cover of Time Magazine. The cover was created by Boris Artzybasheff.Craig Rice - Time Magazine. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://garth.typepad.com/primitive_screwheads/2014/12/craig-rice-time- magazine-.html  Personal life  She had three children, two daughters and a son. \\"Craig Rice kept very few personal records. She was conventionally wed four times with other affairs.\\"Marks, Jeffrey Who Was That Lady?. Lee's Summit: Delphi Books, 2001, p. 51. One of her husbands was beat poet Lawrence Lipton. Like many of her characters, Rice was an alcoholic and made several suicide attempts. She also suffered from deteriorating health, including deafness in one ear and blindness in one eye with incipient glaucoma in the other. She died of a barbiturate and alcohol overdose, aged 49.

This book was ghostwritten by Janet Flanner, who collaborated with Lee after she ended her initial discussions about such a project with Dorothy Wheelock. It has been suggested that Craig Rice ghostwrote this novel; this has been soundly and fully debunked.Marks, Jeffrey Who Was That Lady?. Lee's Summit: Delphi Books, 2001, p. 53. The confusion may have arisen because Craig Rice was initially signed to write the script for G-String Murders, a movie based on the novel which was eventually scripted by James Gunn and released as Lady of Burlesque with Barbara Stanwyck.

Tuba was the headman of the small Hopi village of Moencopi, roughly fifty miles west of the main villages on the Hopi mesas. However, he apparently was an important person in the village of Oraibi as well.James H. McClintock. Mormon Settlement in Arizona, 80 (University of Arizona Press, 1985) Eventually, Tuba joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and later received his endowment in the St. George Temple. Tuba City, Arizona, was named in his honor. Tuba (Toova) and his band on the Moincoppee (Moenkopi) Early life Tuba was born in Oraibi, Arizona, as a member of the Short Corn Clan,Harold Coulander, The Fourth World of the Hopis, 192 (University of New Mexico Press 1971). or possibly the Pumpkin Clan. Hopi tradition does not record his birth name,Harold Coulander, The Fourth World of the Hopis, 192. but he told a Mormon missionary that said his Hopi name was \\"Woo Pah.\\"C. L. Christensen. \\"Hopi Legends\\", Improvement Era (1921). Tuba related to this same missionary that during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (c. 1846), the Mexicans were in full retreat from the environs of the Hopi mesas. However, as they left they caused considerable trouble for the Hopis, and in fact one tried to steal a girl from Oraibi to take south with him. Apparently, Tuba's brother challenged the Mexican interloper to a kind of duel, and the pair fought with bowie knives in the village plaza. Tuba's brother was killed, but Tuba stepped in and killed the Mexican with a spear. This story seems of doubtful historical accuracy for several reasons. Among them, the story recounts that Tuba was eighteen years old when the duel occurred although he would have been in his mid-thirties at the time of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Whatever the case may be, Hopi tradition tells that at some point, Tuba became involved in an unremembered dissension at Oraibi, and left the village to \\"be at peace\\". From then on, \\"Woo Pah\\" was known among the Hopi as Tuuvi, meaning the outcast or the rejected one.Harold Courlander. The Fourth World of the Hopi, 192. Moencopi Tuba settled at Moencopi, or \\"Running Water,\\" about 50 miles west of Oraibi. Moencopi had played any important part in the Hopi's legendary migration cycle. By Tuba's time, the area was used as summer fields for the villagers at Oraibi due to its springs and streams.Harold Courlander. The Fourth World of the Hopi, 191‚Äì92. The Hopi say that at first, Tuba settled at Moencopi alone with his wife, living there all year long whereas before it had merely been a seasonal settlement. However, soon people of Tuba's Short Corn Clan followed him, and eventually members of other clans until a sizeable community was created. Tuba told one Mormon that after he had settled at Moencopi, there came a time when the Hopis who lived with him \\"became lazy and wicked\\", refusing to \\"plant or tend the herds\\". Tuba was greatly distressed about this, and as he sat brooding, he saw an old man approach with a long white beard. The man claimed to have a message from God that the people must plant and take care of their herds or they would die in a three-year famine that was to come. Tuba then turned his head and the man disappeared. Tuba did as instructed and stored his own corn in a bin which was enough to last through the predicted famine. Purportedly, Tuba explained that a long time ago there were three men that had been left on the earth, and when the Hopi were in trouble, one would come to advise them. He believed that this stranger was one of them.Evelyn Wooster. \\"Echoes from the Past\\", Improvement Era (1950).It is here interesting to note a Spanish chronicle describing the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. It records the testimony of an 80-year-old shaman from the pueblo of San Felipe named Pedro Naranjo. Naranjo claims that the Tewa Pop√© settled on a plan to drive the Spanish from the Southwest after a vision in a estufa (kiva) in Taos Pueblo. In the vision, Pop√© saw three figures named Caudi, Tilini, and Tleume going underground to the mythical lake of Copala. It was they who told him to tie a yucca cord into knots to sympolize the number of days before the rebellion should take place. David Roberts. The Pueblo Revolt, 140‚Äì42. Visit to Utah The first Mormon missionaries to visit the Hopi came in 1858 under the leadership of Jacob Hamblin. It is unclear if Tuba still lived in Oraibi at this point, or if he had already moved to Moencopi. However, Hamblin writes that upon their arrival a \\"very aged man\\" (presumably not Tuba) reported a prophecy that men would come to the Hopi from the west who would bring them back blessings which they had lost and that he believed that Hamblin and the Mormons were those spoken of. Hamblin soon left, but a few Mormons stayed behind to teach the Hopi. However, these left in the middle of winter to preserve the peace after a strong contention had begun in Oraibi as to whether they were in fact those spoken of by the prophecy.Jacob Hamblin. Jacob Hamblin: A Narrative of His Personal Experience, 63‚Äì64 (1881). One may speculate that the prophecy referred to is a reference to the well known Hopi myth of the Pahana, the Lost White Brother. However, the Pahana myth specifically states that the Pahana will return from the east, not from the west. Thus, either a mistranslation occurred, or the \\"very aged man\\" made reference to a completely separate prophecy. It might be speculated that this contention over the Mormons is the unnamed dissension that caused Tuba to leave Oraibi and settle at Moencopi. In any event, in early 1860, Tuba became acquainted with Mormon missionaries Thales Haskel and Marion Shelton in Oraibi, and invited them to settle in Moencopi and build a wool mill. However, they returned to southern Utah.Rex C. Reeve, Jr. and Galen L. Fletcher. Mormons in the Tuba City Area. Ten years later, in November 1870, Tuba left his home with his wife, Pulaskaninki, in company with Hamblin to spend time in southern Utah in order to learn the ways of the Mormons.James H. McClintock. Mormon Settlement in Arizona, 80. This was apparently in contravention of a Hopi taboo forbidding Hopis from crossing the Colorado River until three prophets which had led the Hopi to their current home returned. Upon reaching the Colorado, Hamblin recorded: Tuba spent nearly a year in the company of the Mormons. He was able to meet LDS Church president, Brigham Young, in St. George, Utah. Tuba was particularly impressed by a factory where yarn was being mechanically spun. In Hopi culture, it is the men who spin the yarn for blankets, and it is spun by hand. According to Hamblin, after seeing this factory, Tuba \\"could never think of spinning yarn again with his fingers, to make blankets\\".Jacob Hamblin: A Narrative of His Personal Experience, 113 (1887). His wife was most impressed by the Mormon grist mills, a major improvement over grinding corn by stone. Sacred Hopi stone Although Tuba seems to have had various disagreements with village leaders in Oraibi, he apparently retained access to one of the Hopi's sacred stones. On one occasion, several Mormons were visiting Tuba in Oraibi and he took his visitors inside the village kiva. There, he produced what appeared to be a marble slab about 15√ó18 inches covered in \\"hieroglyphic\\" markings including clouds and stars.James H. McClintock. Mormons Settlement in Arizona, 81‚Äì82. The later Ethnological Report No. 4 produced by the U.S. government seems to uphold the existence of such a stone based on the testimony of John W. Young and Andrew S. Gibbons. This describes the stone as made of \\"red-clouded marble, entirely different from anything found in the region\\". Tuba City and baptism In 1873, Tuba again invited the Mormons to come and live by his village of Moencopi. This time, the offer was accepted, although a permanent Latter-day Saint presence did not become a reality until 1875. But the resultant community became the first Mormon settlement in Arizona.Richard G. Oman. \\"Sacred Connections: LDS Pottery in the Native American Southwest\\". BYU Studies 35, no. 1, 107 (1995). Hopi tradition has it that Tuba invited the Mormons to settle near his village in order to gain protection from marauding Paiutes and Navajos.Harold Courlander. The Fourth World of the Hopis, 192. Tuba was baptized into the LDS Church in 1876. In April 1877, Tuba and his wife attended the dedication of the Mormon temple in St. George, Utah, in company with missionary Andrew S. Gibbons and his wife. It was sometime during this period that Tuba shared his new faith with Tom Polacca, a headman at Hano on First Mesa, who was also eventually baptized.\\"Indian Art Reflects 'Sacred Connection' to Gospel Truths\\", Church News, Oct. 29, 1994. Polacca was the half brother of the famous Hopi potter Nampeyo. Though he eventually lost track of the LDS Church, at his death he made his descendants promise that they would join no other Christian denomination. Today the Polacca/Nampeyo family is perhaps the most famous family of Hopi potters. Many of its members had joined the LDS Church in response to Tom's command. In September 1878, Tuba helped lay out the site for a new Mormon town near Moencopi which would be called Tuba City. Both Mormons and some Hopis moved into the new town, although other Hopi leaders objected when Tuba gave the land on which the town was situated to the Mormons. In 1879, a wool factory was built in Tuba City in order to \\"benefit the Indians and the [LDS] Church\\".James H. McClintock. Mormon Settlement in Arizona, 159. No doubt this edifice reminded Tuba of the factory which had so engaged his imagination in southern Utah nine years before. Later life The settlement of his Mormon friends at Tuba City and the completion of the factory may have been a high point in Tuba's life, for it seems his last decade was marked with sadness. The woolen factory was in operation for only a short time and within a few years it had fallen into disrepair. It is reported that Tuba \\"took particular pride in watching over the remains of the factory, but after his death the ruination of the building was made complete\\". It also seems that at some point in his last years, Tuba's wife left him for a younger man, and afterwards Tuba spent about three years living in the home of Mormon missionary Christian Lyngaa (\\"Lingo\\") Christensen. Tuba died in 1887, and at least some of Tuba's children were still living in Moencopi into the mid-twentieth century. In 1941, a sandstone marker with a bronze plaque was dedicated in Tuba City by the LDS Church in honor of Tuba.\\"The Church Moves On\\", Improvement Era (1941). Notes References *James H.

The route runs from PA 230 in Londonderry Township in Dauphin County east to PA 241 in South Londonderry Township in Lebanon County. The route is a two-lane undivided road known as Colebrook Road for its entire length, passing through rural areas. Along the way, PA 341 crosses PA 743 near Deodate and passes through Upper Lawn. An eastbound truck route, PA 341 Truck, bypasses the route between PA 230 and PA 743. PA 341 was first designated onto its current alignment by 1930, running between U.S. Route 230 (US 230, now PA 230) and PA 241. The route was fully paved in the 1930s. Between the 1930s and 1940s, PA 341 headed southeast along Lawn Road to end at PA 241 in Lawn. Route description PA 341 begins at an intersection with PA 230 in Londonderry Township, Dauphin County, where PA 341 Truck heads east along PA 230. From this intersection, the route heads northeast along two-lane undivided Colebrook Road, running through rural residential areas before it comes to a bridge under the PA 283 freeway. The road curves east and passes through wooded land with a few homes. PA 341 intersects Toll House Road, which heads south to an interchange with PA 283, and continues east-northeast into agricultural areas with some trees and homes. The route comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) and continues through rural land as it enters Conewago Township. The road turns east and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few homes. PA 341 passes through the community of Deodate before it intersects PA 743, at which point PA 341 Truck returns to the route. The route heads northeast into farmland with some trees and residences past this intersection. PA 341 enters South Londonderry Township in Lebanon County, continuing east through rural areas with some homes. In the community of Upper Lawn, the route turns northeast to remain along Colebrook Road and runs through agricultural land with some woods. PA 341 turns southeast and comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA 241. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 341 was not given a legislative number. PA 341 was designated by 1930 to run from US 230 (now PA 230) east of Middletown east to PA 241 near Colebrook along its current alignment. At this time, the route was paved for a short distance east of US 230 and in the Deodate area while remainder was unpaved. The entire length of the route was paved in the 1930s. Also, the route was realigned to head southeast along Lawn Road to end at PA 241 in Lawn. PA 341 was realigned back to its current eastern terminus in the 1940s. Major intersections PA 341 Truck Pennsylvania Route 341 Truck is an eastbound truck route of PA 341 between PA 230 in Londonderry Township and PA 743 in Conewago Township, where trucks with three or more axles are prohibited.

On 27 October 1856, at the age of eighteen, he became a Lazarist novice in Paris. On 25 May 1861, Bedjan was ordained priest there, and, after a few months, returned to Persia/Iran, taking a small reed organ and printing press with him. Until 1880, he worked as a pastor and organist in his home town, and in Urmia. He then returned to France to raise funds for the printing of liturgical and theological works in Syriac. From 1885 to 1900, he was active in Ans, Li√®ge, Belgium.

It doesn't smell the same,\\" he said with a laugh. \\"It's hard to put it in a nutshell. It was a life-changing experience.\\" The contrast he encountered in India was profound. \\"Unless you go to India...you cannot fathom that poverty and deprivation on the one hand and such overwhelming beauty as the Taj Mahal on the other hand. There was always that conflict that dominated my days in India.\\" He said that he hears from many fans about how Yanni's music has had a positive impact on their lives, but from the conductor's podium he's working too hard to notice. \\"We're so involved in the music, we take it for granted.

Removing two cylinders from the 4-cylinder divided the number of cc's by two.

Included was the liquid cooling, the bore and stroke, the double overhead camshafts, and four valves per cylinder. This gave it a great deal of power for its size, redlining at 10,000 RPM while delivering 50 horsepower. The Kawasaki 454 is well known for its acceleration, having raced against a 454 LS big block Chevrolet Corvette and beating it to both 0-60 and the quarter mile by more than a second.\\"Kawasaki 454 LTD vs. Chevrolet 454 Corvette Stoplight to Stoplight Showdown.\\" Cycle Guide Apr. 1985: 30-31. Despite the 440 being its predecessor in the sale of middle-size- displacement motorcycles designed by Kawasaki, the two shared almost nothing in design, as the Kawasaki 440 had a single overhead camshaft and had only two valves per cylinder, and was air-cooled, producing 41 horsepower to the 454's 50 horsepower. Both motorcycles were highly reliable and low maintenance, but for different reasons, as the 440 was just a very simple machine to service, and the 454 needed little maintenance over time as a result of its belt drive. The Kawasaki 454 was discontinued in favor of the Kawasaki Vulcan 500 in 1990, with no increase in horsepower despite the larger engine size. The reason for the switch to the nearly identical early Vulcan 500 was that manufacture of the 908 cc Ninja had ceased in 1990, and was replaced by the 500 cc Ninja, and thus there were no more 908 engines to have two cylinders removed from, to turn it into a 454 engine. The Vulcan 500 was designed very similarly to the 454, with the basis again being from a Ninja counterpart, but the engine was taken straight from the 500 Ninja, and still de-tuned slightly compared to the 454 to give it more cruiser-like characteristics, with other changes such as a chain drive (implemented in later models), and no tachometer on the Vulcan 500 being implemented in the changeover, along with a bicycle spoke look for the wheels. Many of these changes took place over time as the Vulcan changed from its Model A form (very similar to that of the 454) to the Model C form.

Structure  Epiregulin consists of 46 amino acid residues. Its secondary structure contains approximately 30 percent of Œ≤-sheet in the strand. Some of the residues form loops and turns due to the hydrogen bonding. The percentage of Œ≤-sheet in epiregulin depends on the domain and the secondary structures that they occupy. The polymeric molecules of epiregulin has the formula weight of 5280.1 g/mol with a polypeptide(L), a polymer type. Structural motifs in most proteins have typical connections in an all Œ≤ motif. Meaning that the polypeptide chains do not make a crossover connection or in so far as this type of connection has not been observed. Epiregulin is one of the proteins that occupies a typical connection in all Œ≤ motif. Furthermore, as the structure of epiregulin forms a chain in an all Œ≤ motif, it also forms Œ≤ hairpin structural motif. A Œ≤ hairpin is when the two adjacent anti-parallel Œ≤ strands connected by a Œ≤-turn.  Function  Epiregulin is a member of the epidermal growth factor family. Epiregulin can function as a ligand of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as a ligand of most members of the ERBB (v-erb-b2 oncogene homolog) family of tyrosine-kinase receptors. The secondary structure at the C-terminus epiregulin is different from other epidermal growth factor family ligands because of the lack of hydrogen bonds. The structural difference at the C-terminus may provide an explanation for the reduced binding affinity of epiregulin to the ERBB receptors.

History  = The law school = On June 27, 1959, an institution for the teaching of law was created in Rosario, as a result of the demands made by the law students from Rosario who had to travel daily to Santa Fe, located 170 km to the north, in order to attend classes. This institution was part of the National University of the Littoral, which is based in the city of Santa Fe. On February 15, 1967, Resolution N¬∫ 75 was passed by Dr. Carlos Mar√≠a Gelly y Obes, the national Education Minister, by which the \\"institution for the teaching of law\\" became the Law School. Nevertheless, it was still part of Santa Fe's National University of the Littoral. The Universidad Nacional de Rosario (UNR) was created by law N¬∞ 17.987, passed on November 29, 1968, and began operating on December 16 of the same year. Shortly after, on March 15, 1969, the National Government passed decree N¬∞ 1528, creating the School of Law and Political Sciences of Rosario and incorporating it into the Universidad Nacional de Rosario (UNR) instead of Santa Fe's Universidad Nacional del Litoral. Students of political sciences and of law attended classes together until 1974, when the students of political sciences were given their own building. Since then, the law school has been called the Law School of Rosario.  Programs  The law program is divided into an introductory course of three months, a basic cycle of 1 year, and the advanced cycle, which is the backbone of the program and takes around 5 years to complete. After passing all of the different stages, the student becomes a lawyer. (In Argentina, there is no need to be further examined by a bar association, as in other countries.) The School of Law also offers post-graduate courses for other degrees and certifications, such as Notary public, Doctorate in Law, and several specific Master's degrees.

Betacellulin, is a part of an Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family that has been spotted in the conditioned cell lines that was taken from mice pancreatic Beta cell tumor. When a sequence of the purified protein and a cloned cDNA was extracted, it supported the claim that in fact betacellulin is a new ligand formed from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As the role a EGFR, betacellulin is manifested by different form of muscles and tissues, it also has a great effect of nitrogen that is used for retinal pigment epithelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. While many studies attest a role for betacellulin in the differentiation of pancreatic Œ≤-cells, the last decade witnessed the association of betacellulin with many additional biological processes, ranging from reproduction to the control of neural stem cells. Betacellulin is a member of the EGF family of growth factors. It is synthesized primarily as a transmembrane precursor, which is then processed to mature molecule by proteolytic events. This protein is a ligand for the EGF receptor. As a typical EGFR ligand, betacellulin is expressed by a variety of cell types and tissues, and the soluble growth factor is proteolytically cleaved from a larger membrane-anchored precursor. Betacellulin stimulated the proliferation of retinal pigment epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells at a concentration of [difference]30 pM (1 ng/ml) but did not stimulate the growth of several other cell types, such as endothelial cells and fetal lung fibroblasts. Betacellulin chemically bonds and activates tyrosine residues phosphorylation of the epidemic growth factor. Osteoblasts, which are responsible for forming and mineralizing osteoid, express EGF receptors and alter rates of proliferation and differentiation in response to EGF receptor activation. Transgenic mice over-expressing the EGF- like ligand betacellulin (BTC) exhibit increased cortical bone deposition; however, because the transgene is ubiquitously expressed in these mice, the identity of cells affected by BTC and responsible for increased cortical bone thickness remains unknown. We have therefore examined the influence of BTC upon mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and pre-osteoblast differentiation and proliferation. BTC decreases the expression of osteogenic markers in both MSCs and pre-osteoblasts increases in proliferation require hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha), as an HIF antagonist prevents BTC-driven proliferation. Both MSCs and pre-osteoblasts express EGF receptors ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3, with no change in expression under osteogenic differentiation. These are the first data that demonstrate an influence of BTC upon MSCs and the first to implicate HIF-alpha in BTC-mediated proliferation. as you can see the role of Betacellulinis a bit flexible enough to divert its response based on part where it binds.  Structure  BTC is a polymer of about 62-111 amino acid residues. Secondary Structure: 6% helical (1 helices; 3 residues) 36% beta sheet (5 strands; 18 residues) *BTC was originally identified as a growth-promoting factor in mouse pancreatic Œ≤-cell carcinoma cell line and has since been identified in humans. Mouse BTC (mBTC) is expressed as a 178-amino acid precursor. The membrane-bound precursor is cleaved to yield mature secreted mBTC. BTC is synthesized in a wide range of adult tissues and in many cultured cells, including smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells. The amino acid sequence of mature mBTC is 82.5%, identical with that of human BTC (hBTC), and both exhibit significant overall similarity with other members of the EGF family. About the image * The structure for the small protein Betacellulin that is shown was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The species that BTC was taken from was Homo sapiens.

The length of the flow velocity vector is the flow speed and is a scalar. It is also called velocity field; when evaluated along a line, it is called a velocity profile (as in, e.g., law of the wall). Definition The flow velocity u of a fluid is a vector field : \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\mathbf{x},t), which gives the velocity of an element of fluid at a position \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\, and time t.\\\\, The flow speed q is the length of the flow velocity vector :q = \\\\ \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\ and is a scalar field. Uses The flow velocity of a fluid effectively describes everything about the motion of a fluid. Many physical properties of a fluid can be expressed mathematically in terms of the flow velocity. Some common examples follow: =Steady flow= The flow of a fluid is said to be steady if \\\\mathbf{u} does not vary with time. That is if : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t}=0. =Incompressible flow= If a fluid is incompressible the divergence of \\\\mathbf{u} is zero: : abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}=0. That is, if \\\\mathbf{u} is a solenoidal vector field. =Irrotational flow= A flow is irrotational if the curl of \\\\mathbf{u} is zero: : abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{u}=0. That is, if \\\\mathbf{u} is an irrotational vector field. A flow in a simply-connected domain which is irrotational can be described as a potential flow, through the use of a velocity potential \\\\Phi, with \\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\Phi. If the flow is both irrotational and incompressible, the Laplacian of the velocity potential must be zero: \\\\Delta\\\\Phi=0. =Vorticity= The vorticity, \\\\omega, of a flow can be defined in terms of its flow velocity by : \\\\omega= abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{u}. Thus in irrotational flow the vorticity is zero. The velocity potential If an irrotational flow occupies a simply-connected fluid region then there exists a scalar field \\\\phi such that : \\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\mathbf{\\\\phi}. The scalar field \\\\phi is called the velocity potential for the flow. (See Irrotational vector field.)  Bulk velocity  In many engineering applications the local flow velocity \\\\mathbf{u} vector field is not known in every point and the only accessible velocity is the bulk velocity (or average flow velocity) U which is the ratio between the volume flow rate \\\\dot{V} and the cross sectional area A, given by :u_{\\\\rm{}av}=\\\\frac{\\\\dot{V}}{A} where A is the cross sectional area.

She made her first appearance on 26 June 2007. The character was introduced as a guest character, but later became a regular. The sidekick of character Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), most of Heather's storylines involved comedy, and Fergison won the 'Funniest Performance' award at the 2008 Inside Soap Awards. Heather's character is known for her headbands, love of cheese and karaoke, and being a fan of singer George Michael. In 2009, the character was involved in a whodunnit-style storyline when she became pregnant by an unknown man. Several characters were named as possibilities, and the father, teenager Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins) was revealed after the baby, George Trott, was born. She made her final screen appearance on 21 March 2012 as a corpse, after being killed by Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe). Fergison returned to record a voiceover as Heather, which was broadcast on 24 December 2016. Storylines Heather is introduced as the best friend of Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who loves cheese and karaoke, is a fan of George Michael and suffers from asthma. She lives with her controlling mother Queenie Trott (Judy Cornwell) until she moves in with Shirley. She becomes friends with Hazel Hobbs (Kika Mirylees), who asks her to be the bridesmaid at her wedding to Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi). Heather accepts, and enters them into a wedding competition. When Hazel leaves Minty, Heather pretends to be Hazel so they can remain in the competition and split the prize money. Minty and Heather grow closer, and on the eve of the wedding, Heather realises she has fallen in love with Minty and they later marry. However, Heather later files for annulment, as she and Minty did not consummate their marriage. Heather remains in love with Minty, but with no chance of a reconciliation, Shirley decides to cheer Heather up by taking her to visit the home of her idol George Michael. Shirley later discovers that the house they are trespassing in is in fact not George Michael's, but she keeps this information to herself. On a high, Heather decides to find herself a man at R&R;, and Shirley hires a male escort to give her a good time. When Heather discovers this, she slaps Shirley across the face and runs to the toilets in tears. However, an unseen person goes in and comforts Heather, and they sleep together that night. After an argument with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Heather suffers an asthma attack. At the hospital, tests reveal that she is pregnant. Heather gives birth in hospital, she is surprised to be told she has had a boy. She names him George Michael, after the singer. Heather phones the father to tell him he has a son, and it is revealed to be the much younger Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins). Darren makes it clear that he does not want to be a father to George, but says he will support Heather financially. When Darren's girlfriend Libby Fox (Belinda Owusu) finds out, she reveals to everyone that Darren is George's father. Libby's mother Denise Johnson (Diane Parish) then confronts Heather, and says she should not have used a child to make a child. When Shirley moves in with Phil, Heather struggles financially on her own, so Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) move in with her and George. Heather later makes plans to have George christened. Shirley moves back in when and Heather receives a letter from the bank saying they are repossessing the house as the landlord cannot make his mortgage repayments. Shirley suggests that they can squat in the flat but the flat is left alone and the bailiffs seize the house. Heather is upset when she hears Minty plans to marry Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) but Minty finds out that Sam is marrying him to keep him quiet. The next morning, Heather thinks the night before only happened because Minty was drunk. She finds George having breathing problems so takes him to the doctor, and is told he has a cold. Sam moves in with her newborn baby Richard after The Queen Victoria public house is destroyed by a fire (see Queen Vic Fire Week), and Heather worries that Sam will try to steal Minty away from her. However, Sam insists that she will be moving out soon, and tells Heather not to worry about Minty as he would not stray. She meets the vicar, Reverend Stevens (Michael Keating), about George's Christening, and later tries on her wedding dress, which Minty sees, however, Heather reveals she is making it into a Christening gown. During the Christening, Minty leaves abruptly and Heather follows him outside to see him kissing Sam. Sam insults Heather, saying she will always be second best, so Heather leaves in tears. The next day, Heather is depressed but Shirley tells her to snap out of it, and buys her a soft toy for George. Heather finds a large amount of cash inside it, and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) turns up looking for it. He charms her and she gives it to him, but he gives her some back to help her find a new place to live. She decides to move into a nearby flat, 1b Albert Square. Heather begins to suffer financially as she is unable to pay her council tax bill and all her money is being spent on childcare. Her boiler breaks down, causing her health to deteriorate. She attempts to steal from her colleague Dot Branning (June Brown) but changes her mind, however, Dot catches her returning the money, thinking she is taking it. Dot decides to take Heather to the Citizens Advice Bureau for financial help, who say she can pay in instalments. The next day, Heather has no electricity or heating in the flat and confronts Shirley about no longer being there for her. She leaves George while she goes to see her mother to borrow some money, but finds that Queenie has moved away. She rushes back remembering that she left George alone, and leaves him with Darren. Shirley arranges a private party for Heather at R&R; and leaves her some money in payment for cleaning. Heather uses it to put money in her gas and electricity meters. She falls asleep, slowly being poisoned from carbon monoxide from her faulty boiler. The next day, Darren breaks into Heather's flat and finds her unconscious; she is rushed to hospital, where she recovers. Appalled after seeing the state of her flat, Darren takes the responsibility of caring for George, telling Heather that she can still have access. Heather looks after George for a day but decides to allow Darren to have him permanently as she feels it is best for George. Darren's fianc√©e Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) soon gives Darren an ultimatum, and when Darren struggles with George on his own, he scraps his plans for a residency order and returns George to Heather. Heather joins an internet dating website, and starts corresponding with a man named \\"Kevin68\\". Unknown to Heather, \\"Kevin68\\" is actually Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), and Jay joins in when he discovers what Ben is doing. Heather tracks down a mechanic named Kevin Flynn, but it is not Kevin68. She receives another message, claiming to be from Kevin68's sibling, saying he died in a motor accident, leaving Heather very upset. Phil later mocks her, saying Kevin68 probably never existed, so Ben reveals that he was Kevin68. However, Heather forgives him. When Heather goes on holiday to Southend-on-Sea, she meets Dot's nephew Andrew Cotton (Ricky Grover) and the two take a liking to each other, but Heather decides to not take things further when she sees how he treats his mother, Rose (Polly Perkins). When Darren announces he is moving away from Walford, he asks Heather to take good care of George, and gives her some money. The money enables Heather and George to move into their own flat, and Heather takes on a cleaning job at Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) property maintenance firm. Andrew comes back to Walford and vows to Heather that he will make up for his past mistakes with her. Heather initially rejects him, but then they share a kiss, and spend Christmas with each other. Andrew later proposes and she accepts, and they have sex for the first time. When Andrew starts dieting, Rose accuses Heather of trying to change him, but Heather and Dot tell Rose she is bullying Heather. Rose says she wants to be sure they really want to get married, and they insist they are. Heather asks Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to give her away at the wedding and for Shirley to be her maid of honour. At Heather's hen night, Andrew reveals he has a temper when he almost hits Shirley, but Heather stays with him. The following day, Heather attempts to reconcile with Shirley as she feels that the wedding will not be the same without her. However, Shirley rejects her. Ben believes Heather has overheard a conversation between him and Ian about why Phil is in prison and he confronts her. Andrew gives Heather two train tickets and tells her to meet him at The Queen Vic by 6pm if she wants to elope with him. Heather tries to reconcile with Shirley again, but is rejected. Heather decides to elope with Andrew and returns home to find the train tickets. Ben is arrested for perverting the course of justice and he goes to Heather's flat. He argues with Heather and starts looking for the money Dot gave to her so he can leave Walford. As Heather tries to stop him, Ben picks up a photo frame and hits her on the head with it, killing her. Andrew is a suspect but is cleared. Ben hides the murder weapon under his bed and several months later Jay finds it. Shirley eventually learns the truth when accusing Phil of killing Heather, Ben attempts to defend him but instead he accidentally reveals vital information that only the murderer would know. Unbeknown to Phil and Shirley, Ben then goes to the police station and eventually confesses to Heather's murder. Ben's murder charge is dropped and he pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to four years imprisonment. In 2016, Dot retires from her job in the launderette and finds a mixtape made many years earlier by Heather and Shirley, featuring their voices and several Christmas songs. Creation and development =Casting and introduction= Heather was introduced in June 2007 and was originally only meant to be a guest character, but Fergison's contract was extended to six months after the character proved popular. She was introduced as the sidekick of Shirley Carter, played by Linda Henry. After the success of her initial guest appearance, the character officially became \\"semi-regular\\", meaning she would show up on-screen occasionally; however, after September 2007, the character became a regular, moving to the soap's setting of Albert Square. Fergison was surprised at winning the role, stating that \\"On my first day on set, I went and took a seat on Arthur's bench. My mum had passed away, so I wanted to have a little chat with her. I sat there and said 'I can't believe we're finally here, Mum‚Äîthis is just amazing'. It was a strange experience, because I knew she was there with me. She'd be so proud now.\\" Fergison also discussed her relationship with the cast members she worked with most closely at the time, declaring that: \\"We're being called 'The Famous Five'. That's me, Cliff Parisi (Minty Peterson), Linda Henry (Shirley Carter), Bobby Davro (Vinnie Monks) and Ricky Groves (Garry Hobbs). Linda and I laugh all day, every day‚Äîthis is the best job in the world. [...] Being on EastEnders is a privilege.\\" =Personality and appearance= Fergison initially thought Heather was quite childlike, but was pleased that the show had \\"the courage to employ a bigger woman.\\" She explained that viewers would realise that her size is due to her mother: \\"It could be perceived [that the character was just about her size], but when you look into the character, there is more depth to her‚Äîshe's got a terrible mother, there's her background, and so on. You see her eating and, hopefully, people are intelligent enough to go, 'Ah, we can see why she does that.' [...] I'm hoping people will see it's not just about what she looks like. You don't have to be a big person to know that people comfort eat, or to say, 'These terrible things happen in life, that's why she behaves like that.'\\" Fergison explained that there are many levels to Heather's personality. She is a loyal friend who will do anything for anybody, and has low moments along with \\"absolute highs\\". Fergison said she calls the character \\"Heather Hopeful\\" because of her optimism. She reiterated this in February 2011, saying that if Heather found luck and love, she would not be the same character. Fergison also said that she does not mind that her character is mocked for her size, saying that it happens in real life to overweight people: \\"[I]t's about how you deal with it. You have to portray it as long as you can redress the balance in some way at some point. That didn't happen straight away and people said to me, 'Oh my God, she's just the fat person they take the mickey out of'. [...] It's about taking away what Heather looks like, taking away the layers and finding out what she is like underneath. I think that's what EastEnders is doing, and that's a good thing.\\" She also praised the show for having an overweight character, comparing her to all the \\"tiny blondes\\" in teenage soap opera Hollyoaks, and said that people like that Heather is a normal character, which she opined has not been seen for a long time in soaps. She said that comments made to Heather did not upset her, because she was bullied at school for her weight: \\"I learned that if I was funny, then they would stop. Now I don't take anything personally.\\" The character is known for wearing headbands, usually with a matching handbag, and liking singer George Michael. Fergison revealed that the headbands were her idea, saying \\"I've given myself a bit of a headache [...], literally, wearing those things.\\" She also says that she likes George Michael and was extremely pleased when she found out her character was a fan. Heather is also a fan of karaoke, and Fergison cites her first scene where she is singing in front of her fellow cast as embarrassing and strange. =Relationship with Minty Peterson= Discussing the storyline which sees Heather become romantically involved with Minty Peterson, Fergison has expressed her support for their relationship, stating that: \\"This is Heather's only chance in life to have a dream come true. She's always such a kind, positive person, and is always willing to try.\\" She later said \\"I think Minty could be her soul mate, as they're very good friends. They know a lot about each other.\\" Fergison revealed that she found filming the storyline difficult, describing it as an \\"emotional rollercoaster\\": \\"I was laughing and in my most happy element, and then the next minute I would be in tears. [...] A lot of the storyline is about rejection, and it's difficult to film those scenes all the time. I was shattered, but it's a great opportunity. [...] You can go through your whole career and not do as much as you would do in six months of a soap.\\" =Pregnancy and motherhood= Executive producer Diederick Santer hinted at Heather's upcoming storyline in an interview before her pregnancy was revealed in 2009, saying \\"I think it's pretty clear why Heather's self- esteem is so low. It's a combination of her horrid mother, and now it's her friend Shirley who treats her like a child and sort of kills her with well- meant kindness. We've got a great story for Heather this year‚Äîsomething for the delightful Cheryl Fergison to really get hold of. Remember when [Heather] was in tears on Valentine's night in the loo at the R&R;, and her lost yoghurt pot lid appeared under the door? That was the start of something which will see her get a much greater sense of herself, find an identity free of Shirley, and grow as a person in 2009.\\" Fergison disclosed that she was unaware of the identity of the father of Heather's baby, explaining that she was frustrated at not knowing, but eventually realised she liked that it was kept from her. The storyline gave a few hints to the father's identity, and Fergison was excited to find out. The actress deemed it \\"a bit of a risky storyline\\" because of Heather's association with more comedic plots, and suggested that viewers may find the pregnancy farcical due to the lack of build-up. She expressed the opinion it would be \\"brilliant\\" if Heather were to raise the baby with Shirley, as Heather would be scared of being a mother, but Shirley has brought up her own children so could help. However, she believed that Heather would be a great mother, saying \\"it's exactly what she needs and it's somebody who's going to love her.\\" Scripts containing the name of the baby's father were censored or doctored to show the man's name as \\"George\\" due to the secrecy surrounding the storyline. Betting on the identity of the child's father opened in July 2009, with Heather's ex-husband Minty starting as the favourite. Other contenders were the man she met in a nightclub Eddie (Will Chitty), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), Garry, Vinnie, Vinnie's son Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), gay character Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and Charlie Slater (Derek Martin). Betting was suspended in August with Phil standing as the favourite. In September, the possible fathers were reduced to four: Phil, Minty, Darren and Billy. Heather gives birth in October 2009, and Fergison revealed to Digital Spy that the crew attempted to make Heather's waters breaking appear realistic by having her burst a balloon filled with water between her legs. In an interview with What's on TV magazine, Fergison compared George's birth to the birth of her own son, Alex, ten years previously: \\"It was the hardest two weeks of my working life. The script was a one-woman show and I kept thinking when I gave birth to my own son Alex, who's now 10, I never spoke, just screamed a lot! Alex came by Caesarean so I did have to push to a certain extent but I was totally exhausted filming this because I had to do it 50 times! By the end, people were saying I looked like a new mum who'd just given birth!\\" Heather then decides to tell the father about the baby. Fergison said the writing had been clever, as the four \\"suspects\\"‚ÄîMinty, Phil, Darren and Billy‚Äîare seen with their phones ringing, and Heather leaves a voicemail on the fathers's phone. Then each potential father goes to the hospital for various reasons. In December 2009, Santer was asked what his favourite storyline of the year had been. He replied \\"I loved the way the 'Who's The Daddy?' story with Heather played, too. As time goes on, I expect we'll discover more about what happened that night. It makes sense to me‚Äîhe's a horny, drunk 18-year-old! Everyone thinks that they did it in the [toilet] cubicle, but it's surely clear that they went home?\\" In May 2010, Fergison said that Heather would face problems as a single mother, promising a \\"shift in tone\\" for her storylines. =Financial and health problems= On 22 January 2011, it was reported by the Daily Mirror that an upcoming storyline would see Heather collapse after breathing toxic fumes from her faulty boiler, which she cannot afford to have repaired. A spokesperson told the newspaper that Heather hits rock bottom financially and is in desperate need of money, but is too proud to admit it to anybody. The 15 February 2011 episode centres on Heather's everyday life and the problems she faces. Following her collapse, Heather allows George to stay with Darren and his girlfriend Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) out of desperation, but she grows jealous seeing them playing happy families, not realising that Darren is struggling to cope. She decides she wants George back but lets Darren keep him as she feels he is better off with him, even though she is heartbroken, and Darren does not want Heather to have George. Fergison said that Heather would not lose her son as long as she stands up for herself. =Departure and death= On 17 September 2011, Simon Boyle of the Daily Mirror announced Fergison would be leaving EastEnders in 2012. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy later reported Heather would be murdered by Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) during an argument at her flat. Kilkelly revealed further details of Heather's exit on 11 March 2012. He reported that Heather would die when Ben hits her with a picture frame, causing her to fall back and hit her head on a kitchen counter. The attack is witnessed by Ben's friend, Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick) and he, along with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) help Ben cover up his crime. Heather made her final screen appearance on 21 March 2012. Fergison said that she found filming her exit emotional. Other appearances Heather also makes cameo appearances in the Internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. In episode 2 of series 1, Shirley's niece Zsa Zsa Carter (Emer Kenny) runs into her and recognises George from a photo. In episode 3, Zsa Zsa visits Heather in the launderette and steals her purse while she is on the telephone. Leon Small (Sam Attwater) goes into the launderette, stripping to his boxer shorts and leaving Heather embarrassed. Heather realises her purse is missing but Zsa Zsa returns it, saying she found it on the street. In episode 6, Heather asks Zsa Zsa to babysit George. In episode 9, she suggests that Zsa Zsa go back to stay with her mother after Shirley asks her to go home. She also appears in series 2, where in episode 3, Asher (Heshima Thompson) and Sol Levi (Tosin Cole) go into the launderette and she thinks they are going to rob her. Reception The character of Trott was hailed by Mark Wright of The Stage as the \\"[television] stand out of 2007\\". He described her as \\"the divine, the wonderful, the brilliant\\" Heather Trott, played to absolute perfection by actress Cheryl Fergison, and we have somebody new who the writers can engage with and, if they play it right, create a new soap legend.\\" She was also described as a \\"legend\\" by Digital Spy's Kris Green and was nominated for 'Best Newcomer' and 'Best On-Screen Partnership' (with Shirley Carter) at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards. She was also nominated for 'Best Comedy Performance' and 'Best On Screen Partnership' at the 2008 British Soap Awards, 'Best Newcomer' at the 2008 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards and won 'Funniest Performance' at the 2008 Inside Soap Awards. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Heather's exit storyline came second in the \\"Best Storyline\\" category with 25.9% of the vote. Fellow cast member Kara Tointon named Heather as her favourite character in the soap, explaining of her choice: \\"I think she brings something really great to the show, and not just the comedy‚Äîshe's good at emotional scenes too. I love watching her.\\" Garry Bushell, TV critic for the Daily Star, criticised Heather's appearance, dubbing her \\"Heifer\\" and referring to her as a \\"giant dumpling with eyes\\". Bushell found it implausible that Minty would kiss Heather, and later deemed her crush on Garry Hobbs \\"disturbing\\". A writer for the Daily Mirror also criticised her appearance: \\"Her frocks and matching Alice bands could have been stitched together out of Nigel Bates's old ties and if I was actress Cheryl Fergison I'd have cried myself to sleep every night‚Äîespecially after the cruel Brighton episodes. Being fat made Heather fair game and you'd have cheered if Gok Wan had stormed a storyline conference and bitch-slapped the lot of them.\\" The Guardian's Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Heather \\"a big girl with a heart to match\\". She approved of her marriage to Minty, however was critical of the execution of the wedding itself, writing: \\"Indeed, as the only two nice people in Walford, she and Minty were made for each other. [...] EastEnders, who wouldn't recognise tender if they broke a toe on it, treated it all as a big joke.\\" In 2008, the character was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa, when they rated her one of television's most unhealthy characters due to her poor diet. Following the character's death, Alex Hardy of The Times wrote \\"[Heather] was just an accessory in her own murder, really, just as she was only an accessory in the five years she's been in the soap. This is a lady whose \\"big\\" storylines have included stealing cheese from the Minute Mart, being played by a bloke in Harry Hill's TV Burp, and keeping in her bra a yoghurt top that she'd nicked from George Michael's bin. Plot wise, she has long been a dead weight, so perhaps it's only right that she's now literally become one.\\" While commenting on the character's death, a reporter from the Liverpool Daily Post said \\"Walford is better off without Heather Trott. Her character always struck me as one which the script-writers had come to regret. She was like a younger ‚Äì and considerably larger ‚Äì version of Rita Fairclough in Coronation Street.\\" They added that she was the subject of the most random soap storylines since Bouncer was given a dream sequence in Neighbours. Kevin O'Sullivan from the Sunday Mirror said that \\"life extinct\\" was apt for Heather because she was the size of a dinosaur. He added that no one in Walford would really miss Heather. The writer also felt that the \\"massive Ms Trott was never much more a caricature simpleton whose love for George Michael and all things 80s retro was supposed to be side-splitting. But wasn't. Another cardboard cutout bites the dust.\\" In popular culture Heather was frequently parodied on Harry Hill's TV Burp where she was played by Steve Benham dressed up to look like her, often being used as a punchline whenever Harry Hill looked back on the events of the soap from the previous week that involved the character. At the end of TV Burp's final episode, which happened to coincide with the week in which Heather was killed off in Eastenders, Cheryl Fergison herself made a surprise guest appearance.

It runs east‚Äìwest for near the Canadian border, connecting SR 539 near Lynden to SR 9 near Nooksack and Sumas. The highway is a major freight corridor and serves as an alternate route between Bellingham and the Sumas border crossing. The highway runs along Badger Road, which was built in 1890s and paved by the county government in 1922 per the request of citizen petitions. It was incorporated into the state highway system from 1937 to 1951 as part of Secondary State Highway 1A (SSH 1A), which connected to Blaine and Sedro-Woolley. The Lynden section was replaced with a southerly route and re- designated as a branch of SSH 1B in 1957. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 546 replaced the SSH 1B branch, while the rest of the highway became SR 539\\\\. Between 2013 and 2016, the state government built a set of three roundabouts on SR 546 in northern Lynden to replace intersections that had been the site of major collisions. Route description Looking westbound on SR 546 from its eastern terminus with SR 9 SR 546 begins at an intersection with SR 539 and Badger Road northwest of Lynden, located about south of the Canadian border. The highway travels east on Badger Road across the northern outskirts of Lynden and its residential neighborhoods, traversing a pair of roundabouts at Depot Road and Bender Road. After passing more residential areas, a small industrial park, and a third roundabout at Northwood Road, SR 546 leaves Lynden city limits and descends into the lower Nooksack Valley, a flat and rural area with views of Mount Baker. The highway passes several farms and forested plots before it crosses over a branch railroad belonging to the BNSF Railway and reaches a junction with SR 9. SR 546 terminates at the junction, located adjacent to the Nooksack Valley High School campus and approximately southwest of Sumas, and SR 9 continues east onto Badger Road on its way towards Sumas. SR 546 runs through Lynden and the outlying rural areas as a two-lane highway with a posted speed limit of . The highway is designated as a major freight corridor and serves as an alternative route to the 24-hour Sumas border crossing from Interstate 5, which intersects SR 539 in Bellingham. SR 546 is designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance and is listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) estimates that approximately 5,500 to 9,700 vehicles use the highway on a daily basis, based on annual average daily traffic data. The busiest section is located between SR 539 and Depot Road in Lynden, carrying 9,000 to 9,700 vehicles per day in 2016. History Badger Road was once part of the Blaine‚ÄìSumas Highway, a major county road that was built in the 1890s to connect towns in northern Whatcom County, including Lynden and Van Buren. After a successful petition campaign by local residents, the county government completed paving of the highway in 1922, costing an estimated $110,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars). The road was added to the state highway system in 1937 as a section of Secondary State Highway 1A (SSH 1A). The state highway began in Blaine and traveled east to Lynden and Lawrence before turning south and running through Skagit and Snohomish counties along the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The terminus of SSH 1A was moved to an intersection with SSH 1B the south side of the Nooksack River in 1951, leaving Badger Road out of the state highway system for several years. Badger Road was re-added to the highway system in 1957 as a branch of SSH 1B, which ran north‚Äìsouth between Bellingham and the Canadian border. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, the trunk of SSH 1B became SR 539, SSH 1A became SR 9, and the Lynden branch of SSH 1B became SR 546. The renumbering was codified by the state legislature in 1970. In the 2000s, WSDOT began long-term planning for the SR 546 corridor, including determining replacements or retrofits for several intersections in northern Lynden that were the site of several major collisions in the early 2010s. Two roundabouts, located apart at Depot Road and Bender Road, were constructed in 2013 using $5.6 million in federal border funding. Construction of a third roundabout, located at Northwood Road, was completed in July 2016 and required road traffic to be restricted to alternating, one-way patterns. The western terminus of SR 546 is planned to be converted into a multi-lane roundabout with SR 539 in the mid-to-late 2020s as part of the state government's plans for the Guide Meridian corridor.

It is located below Coire Odhar between The Devil's Point and Cairn Toul on the western side of the River Dee in the Lairig Ghru. The bothy is a single room with a fireplace and chimney in its northern gable. Its dimensions are 6m by 3.6m . There is a toilet in the wooden extension to the building. It is used as a mountain refuge and as a starting point for ascents of Munros including The Devil's Point, Cairn Toul, and Braeriach. Name The name Corrour is used as a name for the locality as well as specifically as a name for the bothy itself, the name being derived from Coire Odhar according to , who continues: In the author gives the local pronunciation as Corower, but without explanation. However in the section \\"Hints on Gaelic pronunciation\\" appears to suggest the final-vowels of Coire (and corrie) are dropped to give kor, and that the dh in Odhar are silent because they follow a vowel‚Äîgiving what sounds like kor-Oar, or like the cor- ower suggested in . In spite of the earlier work and his understanding of Gaelic‚Äîand its local dialect‚Äî suggest an alternative origin for the place name as a shelter for the currour or forester's assistant. History In the author writes that the people of mar used Coirie Odhar as a summer shieling for their cattle in the early part of the nineteenth century, but in the later part \\"the area was kept clear for deer\\". =Deer watchers= The original bothy was built in 1877 to house a deer watcher during the summer, and it housed several including Charles Robertson, John Macintosh, and Frank Scott before the estate stopped using the bothy in the 1920s. In the author gives some detail about its occupation by deer watchers, continuing: An even earlier mention, from 1901, gives an account of passing Corrour Bothy: =Open bothy= Later in the author writes that the last watcher at Corrour Bothy was Frank Scott who left in 1920. After then it then became a 'famous open bothy' with a visitor book being left there in 1928 by the Rucksack Club of University College, Dundee. In 1949 the bothy was reconstructed by members of the Cairngorm Club, with help from a wide range of individuals and other mountaineering clubs (, , ). Archaeologically, the site is complicated: close to the bothy there are stones in the ground that appear to have formed part of some earlier construction, perhaps the remains of the summer shieling-huts. In the authors write that they found \\"the remains of a hut with stone-footings, which is set into the grassy slope a short distance south-east of the present hut.\\" Present In the author refers to the bothy's origin, its reconstruction in 1949 by the Cairngorm Club, and the fact that it is maintained by the Mountain Bothies Association. The subject of is the acquisition of full planning permission by the Mountain Bothies Association to add an extension to the bothy to house toilet facilities. A composting toilet has been installed in the extension at the south gable end of the bothy.

V., was one of the major Indian novelists and playwrights and a pioneering playwright and novelist of Malayalam literature. He was known for his historical novels such as Marthandavarma, Dharmaraja and Ramaraja Bahadur; the last mentioned considered by many as one of the greatest novels written in Malayalam.  Biography  CV as a young man Born in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), capital city of the erstwhile native State of Travancore, on 19 May 1858 to Panavilakath Neelakanta Pillai, a Sanskrit scholar and Parvathy Pillai, a scion of an ancient matrilineal family; both his parents were from middle-class families and employees at the Palace of the Maharaja of Travancore. Pillai got his family name, Cannankara, through matrilineal succession.

He continued education at the first English school in Thiruvananthapuram. Subsequently, he graduated from His Highness Maharaja's College (the present-day University College Thiruvananthapuram), the first- ever College in Travancore, where he reportedly had a brilliant academic career under John Ross, the principal of the institution and Robert Harvey. and obtained his BA degree from the Madras University in 1881, securing the 7th rank in the Madras Presidency. t was during this period, he started his first periodical named The Kerala Patriot.

Later, joined the Government Press and held the position of a superintendent when he retired from service. In between, he founded three publications, Malayali in 1886, Vanchiraj in 1901 and Mitabhashi in 1920. Pillai's first marriage did not last long. He married again in 1887 at the age of 30, and his wife, Bhageerathi Amma, was only 16 at the time of the wedding. The marriage lasted till his wife's untimely death in 1904 and his third marriage was to Janaki Amma, the elder sister of Bhageerathi Amma and the widow of C.

AWSTS trained newly commissioned Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the MH-53E Sea Dragon and was a part of Mission Conduct helicopter flight training and initial Mine Countermeasures training for all US Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon pilots and aircrew. All basic, conversion and refresher pilots as well as aircrew receive training in the MH-53E to prepare them for follow on assignment in the United States Navy. History Airborne Mine Countermeasures Weapon Systems Training School (AWSTS) was established 1 October 1994, at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia and subsequently designated a special mission command in July 1996. Its mission is to provide initial MH-53E Sea Dragon systems and flight training, as well as advanced tactical and weapon systems training, to pilots and aircrew of the Airborne Mine Countermeasures and Heavy Combat Support communities. With an average staff of 11 officers and 23 enlisted personnel, the school was established to fill a void left by the decommissioning of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron TWELVE (HM-12) and the U.S. Navy‚Äôs decision to conduct MH-53E training in conjunction with CH-53E Super Stallion training at Marine Helicopter Training Squadron Three Zero Two (HMT-302). Under this reorganization and subsequent refinements, AWSTS assumed duties as MH-53E Course Curriculum Model Manager and responsibility to conduct M-53E pilot and aircrew ground and simulator training for both the familiarization (FAM) and Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) portions of the MH-53E syllabus using the operational flight trainer (OFT) and the AMCM Stream and Recovery Module (ASRM). HMT-302 was assigned responsibility for MH-53E basic FAM flight training. AMCM flight training was made the responsibility of the individual fleet squadrons. Along with its primary mission, AWSTS also functions as the Model Manager for the MH-53E NATOPS, the AMCM TACAID, and the MH-53E Computer Based Training (CBT) System. In January 2001, MH-53E flight training returned to Norfolk, VA under a new integrated training concept between AWSTS and Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron FOURTEEN (HM-14). AWSTS assumed all functions of a Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) with the exception that HM-14 was assigned responsibility to provide and maintain the aircraft, and augment AWSTS with flight instructors when required. As the MH-53E FRS, AWSTS provides flight and ground training to student pilots and aircrew through all phases of their Chief of Naval Operations approved syllabus. Prospective HM pilots and aircrew are detailed to AWSTS for over 20 weeks of intensive, computer based MH-53E systems, pre-flight, simulator, and basic flight training. Upon completion of the syllabus, HM pilots and aircrew remain at AWSTS for AMCM systems and simulator training in the OFT and ASRM. Once complete, these pilots and aircrew report to their respective fleet squadrons (HM-14 or HM-15)where they will conduct their first actual AMCM flights. To date, over 600 pilots and aircrew have passed through AWSTS on their way to the fleet. In summer 2004, AWSTS was awarded the Commander Theodore G. Ellyson Aviator Production Excellence Award for calendar year 2003. The award, similar to the operational Battle ‚ÄúE‚Äù, is given to two CNATRA squadrons and three Fleet Replacement Squadrons including one East Coast, one West Coast and one Marine Corps that demonstrated the ‚Äúgreatest production efficiency in training the fleet requirement for pilots, naval flight officers and aircrewmen within the CNO approved syllabus time.‚Äù Receiving the Ellyson Award is a tribute to the professionalism, teamwork, dedication, and adherence to safety of the sailors at AWSTS. AWSTS has defined tactical requirements for MH-53E roles in AMCM, Heavy Lift, and Special Warfare, culminating with the establishment of the CHSCWL Weapons Training Unit and the MH-53E Air combat Tactical Training Continuum. AWSTS has led the fleet in incorporating the Naval Aviator Production Process Improvement (NAPPI) resulting in improved student tracking, reducing the average time to train, and improving the quality of replacement pilots and aircrew sent to the fleet. The Barrier Removal Team established by AWSTS to identify and remove obstacles hindering aircraft availability and hence improve pilot and aircrew production was so successful that it has been used as a model for implementation into other Fleet Replacement Squadrons. Furthermore, AWSTS directed the complete overhaul of five separate MH-53E Navy flight manuals and the development of a comprehensive NTTP Tactical Pocket Guide, promoting the continued improvement of this legacy aircraft and solidifying the role of the MH-53E in the fleet for decades to come. On 1 October 2015, AWSTS officially became HM-12. The transition helped reaffirm the Navy's commitment to the MH-53E and the HM community by providing the FRS with its own maintenance department, support personnel and bolstered its ability to serve as the HM community leader.

He served from 2007 until 2014 as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 20, which includes Takoma Park and Silver Spring neighborhoods including Hillandale, Woodmoor, White Oak, Indian Spring, East Silver Spring, Park Hills, Sligo Park Hills, Long Branch, Seven Oaks/Evanswood, Sligo-Branview, Burnt Mills, Burnt Mills Hills, South Four Corners, Franklin Knolls, Montgomery Knolls, Clifton Park Village, Oakview, Quaint Acres, and parts of Colesville in Montgomery County. Background Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Hucker graduated from St. Louis University High School. He won a Gasson Scholarship to Boston College and graduated with honors in 1988, majoring in biology, English, and philosophy. There, he was prominent in efforts to end apartheid and protect the environment. He was twice elected to the Senate of the Undergraduate Government of Boston College, and was elected President of the Boston College MASSPIRG chapter and Treasurer of the statewide MASSPIRG Board of Directors. For his senior thesis, he directed a statewide student lobbying effort to pass legislation strengthening Massachusetts' testing standards for drinking water. After graduation, Hucker continued his career as a public interest advocate by moving to Washington, D.C. to work for the Fund for Public Interest Research. There, he ran field campaigns for the United States Public Interest Research Group and the Sierra Club to reauthorize the federal Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and other federal legislation. As a Regional Campaign Director, he supervised offices in the southern United States and later others along the east coast. Career Hucker came to prominence in Maryland politics when he founded Progressive Maryland, an advocacy group, in 2001. The group brought together thousands of individual members in partnership with dozens of the state's largest community, labor, civil rights, and faith-based organizations into a single organization to improve the lives of working families in Maryland. The group combined door-to- door organizing, grassroots leadership development, policy research, and face- to-face advocacy with lawmakers. In that role, he authored and led successful campaigns to pass the Montgomery County living wage law in 2001, and the Prince George's County living wage law in 2002. Both laws require most county contractors to pay their workers enough to feed their families without food stamps‚Äîover 130% of the federal poverty level. As an advocate in Annapolis, he then authored and led efforts to pass the nation's first statewide living wage bill in 2004, which was vetoed after the legislative session by Gov. Robert Ehrlich. The bill was sponsored by Del. Herman Taylor. Rather than overriding Ehrlich's veto, House and Senate leaders instead decided to pursue a bill with a much larger impact on low-income workers by raising the state minimum wage, the first time Maryland had passed a minimum wage higher than the federal standard. The increase was estimated to produce a pay raise for 129,000 Maryland workers. As director of Progressive Maryland, Hucker was recognized with the Friends of Latinos award by the Hispanic Democratic Club of Montgomery County, the Defenders of Justice award from the Maryland Alliance for Justice, and their Public Service award by the League of Korean Americans of Maryland. Hucker was elected to his first term in the House of Delegates in 2006, after a four-month grassroots campaign. He was endorsed by The Washington Post, which wrote that Hucker \\"has proven most effective at getting good bills enacted\\" (September 10, 2006). Hucker was also endorsed by The Gazette, the Montgomery County Education Association and the Montgomery Federation of Teachers, the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, the National Organization for Women, the Maryland Nurses Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, Equality Maryland, the Montgomery County Career Fire Fighters Association/IAFF L. 1664,http://www.montgomerycountyfirefighters.com/ the Hispanic Democratic Club, the Coalition of Asian Pacific American Democrats (CAPAD-MD), the Alliance of Retired Americans, the Hispanic Democratic Club of Montgomery County, the Progressive Democrats of America, the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, and over 25 other organizations. State legislature Hucker currently serves on the House Economic Matters Committee, and on its Consumer, Workers Compensation, and Insurance Subcommittees. He previously served on the Environmental Matters Committee, and on its Environment, Natural Resources, and Land Use and Ethics Subcommittees. In 2010, House Speaker Michael E. Busch appointed Hucker the House Chair of the Joint Committee on Federal Relations, and Montgomery County Delegation Chair Brian Feldman appointed him to be the Chair of the Bi-County Affairs Committee, which regulates the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and the Maryland- National Capital Park and Planning Commission. In April 2009, he was appointed to serve on the Climate, Energy, and Environment Policy Committee of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. In June 2009, the White House appointed Hucker to a new organization, State Legislators for Health Care Reform to provide policy advice and organize support for the President's national health care reform efforts. In his first General Assembly session, Hucker authored and was co-lead sponsor of the first statewide living wage law in the nation. The legislation received national media attention including this article in The New York Times. The law required most state contractors to pay their workers wages high enough to feed their families without needing food stamps‚Äîabout 130% of the federal poverty level (HB 430). In 2009, Hucker passed HB 184 to require the state to finalize a plan to offer universal pre- Kindergarten for all Maryland four-year-olds, and HB 1263 to reduce mercury pollution by requiring auto manufacturers to pay to recycle mercury capsules in older American cars. In 2010, Hucker built on HB 184 by passing HB 350 to require the Maryland State Department of Education to apply for federal Early Education Challenge Grant support to expand pre-kindergarten in Maryland. Also in 2010, he passed HB 1250 to significantly strengthen the state law against SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) suits to protect environmentalists and civic activists from frivolous lawsuits intended to harass and intimidate. He also successfully sponsored HB 1322 to fight human trafficking by requiring all hotels and motels that have been the site of prostitution or human trafficking to post a sign in every hotel room with information on human trafficking and the phone number of the National Human Trafficking Hotline. The bill was a priority of the Maryland State Police, the Montgomery County Police, and the Women Legislators of Maryland. Hucker has also sponsored legislation to expand health care access, ban arsenic from chicken feed, provide mental health services for veterans, facilitate offshore wind turbines, and ban discrimination in housing. Hucker was recognized as a 100% Environmental Voter by the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and Environment Maryland. He also received a 100% rating from Equality Maryland, and has been a vocal advocate for marriage equality. Hucker was also described as a \\"Champion of Working Families\\" by Progressive Maryland and received the highest score in the Maryland General Assembly. Hucker serves as the representative of the Maryland General Assembly on the Board of Directors of Purple Line Now!,http://www.purplelinenow.org an advocacy group organizing to protect the environment and expand transit options by building a light rail line from Bethesda through Silver Spring, past the University of Maryland- College Park, and on to New Carrollton, Maryland. The group led a successful organizing campaign that resulted in a decision by Gov. Martin O'Malley that the Purple Line would be a light rail line, following similar decisions by the state legislative delegations, County Executives, and County Councils in both Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Because of his years of successful advocacy inside and outside the General Assembly, Hucker now also serves on the Board of Directors of the Progressive States Network, a national nonprofit that provides research and strategic advocacy tools to help state legislators to pass progressive policy reforms, including legislation to reward work, strengthen communities, and expand health care access. Hucker endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for President in 2007, months in advance of the Maryland Presidential Primary, and served on the Maryland for Obama Steering Committee.

One Touch spawned four singles, three of which reached the top twenty, while the album's lead single \\"Overload\\" was nominated for a BRIT Award for \\"Best British Single\\". The album's sales did not meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. The group's second album Angels with Dirty Faces was released in August 2002 through Island Records. Influenced by the new wave, dance, and pop music of the 1980s, the record enjoyed success in the UK, where it reached number two and went triple platinum. It produced two number one singles and was nominated for \\"Best British Album\\" at the 2003 BRIT Awards. Three, Sugababes' third album, was released in October 2003. It reached number three in the UK and produced four singles, all of which reached the top ten. The group's fourth album, Taller in More Ways, was released in October 2005. The album reached number one and went double platinum in the UK. On 21 December 2005, it was announced Buena left the Sugababes. According to an announcement on their official website, \\"[Buena]'s decision was based purely on personal reasons and she will continue to remain the best of friends with both [Buchanan] and [Range]\\". Buena later stated in an interview that she was suffering from postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter combined with the group's increasingly hectic schedules, and chose to leave to spend more time with her daughter. The last remaining original member, Buchanan, said upon Buena's departure, \\"...we will all miss Mutya, but we also knew there was still a place for bringing in somebody new who could help us carry on taking the Sugababes brand of music forward\\". Amelle Berrabah joined the group 48 hours after Buena's departure. Buena performing with Sugababes in August 2004 =2006‚Äì09: Real Girl, other ventures and musical hiatus= Following her departure from the Sugababes, Buena began working on her debut album in early 2006 after signing with her previous label, Universal Island Records. She also contributed vocals to the album Soundboy Rock by Groove Armada. The first single to be released in the UK featuring Buena was a ballad duet with George Michael, titled \\"This Is Not Real Love\\". It was released in November 2006 and reached number 15 in the UK. Preceding the album, the title track, \\"Real Girl\\", was released in early 2007. It reached number 2 in the UK and received a BRIT Award nomination for \\"Best Single\\". The song samples Lenny Kravitz's hit \\"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\\", and was produced by London-based production company Full Phat. \\"Real Girl\\" was also featured on the Sex and the City, Vol 2: More Music Soundtrack. Buena's debut album, Real Girl, peaked at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart. \\"Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)\\", her collaboration with dance duo Groove Armada, was released in the UK in July 2007 peaked at number 8. The fourth release from the album was \\"Just a Little Bit\\", which reached number 65. Buena also collaborated with Amy Winehouse, on a re-working of the track \\"Be My Baby\\" by The Ronettes titled \\"B Boy Baby\\", which reached number 73 in the UK top 75. On 1 October 2007, Buena was nominated for the 2007 British \\"Music of Black Origin\\" (MOBO) awards at the O2 Arena in London. On 12 February 2008, Buena was dropped by her record label due to poor sales and charting positions from Real Girl and her last two singles, \\"Just a Little Bit\\" and \\"B Boy Baby\\". In October 2008, Buena appeared on Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong. In January 2009, Buena featured on Asher D's second single \\"With You\\", from his album Ashley Walters, as well as the Don-E track \\"The Time Is Now\\". She also promoted the collaborations \\"Fallin'\\" with Agent X and \\"Give Back\\" with Tah Mac. Buena also joined an array of UK, US and Jamaican artists to feature on the debut single of the London-based urban/funky house production duo, NightShift. The song is titled \\"Can You Persuade Me\\" and it also features MegaMan (So Solid Crew), DJ Ironik, Sisq√≥, Tanto Metro & Devonte, TQ, Steelo, Juxci D, J2K, Wretch 32, Sam Obernik and Mr. Vegas. After rejection from Buena, the song was then recorded by Pitbull as \\"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\\".

The album deals with Camden Town market in London, and has been available for purchase at the market itself and online. She recorded a series of covers of rock songs from rock bands such as U2, The Pixies and Iron Maiden, in a chilled-out-lounge style. In October 2010, Buena confirmed she was no longer interested in a career in the music industry and that she is currently training to become a psychologist for children. Despite the announcement, Buena teamed up with City Boy Soul, a band consisting of ex- Damage singer Coree Richards and British rapper Gak Jonze, and digitally released \\"Be Ok\\" in January 2011. Buena also recorded lead vocals for \\"Give Me Love\\", penned by UK DJ/Producer Paul Morrell. Mutya was set to release \\"My Love\\" featuring Thor Alaye in early 2012 and \\"Bedroom\\" featuring Shide Boss during the same year. Buena performed at Birmingham Gay Pride on 28 May 2011. In 2011, Mutya released a demo on soundcloud called \\"All B4\\". On 2 January 2009, Buena entered Celebrity Big Brother 6 as a housemate. On 16 January 2009, day 15 of the series, she walked out of the Big Brother house after surviving eviction the same night. She was the last celebrity housemate to walk from the show until Claire King left the Summer 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother on 31 August 2014. =2011‚Äì2017: Forming Mutya Keisha Siobhan= In October 2011, several news outlets reported that the original line-up of the Sugababes would reform. In January 2012, further circulations that the group would reunite were sparked, after both Buena and Buchanan tweeted that they were in the studio with \\"two other females\\" and British rapper Professor Green. However, Buena later denied this on Twitter, saying: \\"No track [with] keisha or professor G he was around tha studio. im jus workin on my stuff @ tha moment. (sic)\\" Despite this, Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sand√© confirmed to MTV UK that she had written new songs for Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy, saying: \\"Yes, that is true. I've written for the original line-up of the Sugababes, which I‚Äôm very happy about because I just loved them when they first came out. I loved their sound, it was so cool. It was very different, so I‚Äôm happy to kind of be involved in what started the whole Sugababes journey. It sounds amazing.\\" In April 2012, it was reported that the line-up had signed a ¬£1 million record deal with Polydor Records. In June 2012, Donaghy confirmed on Twitter that new music would be released, saying: \\"the soonest it'll be is in 2 weeks. The latest is 10 weeks.\\" In July 2012, it was officially confirmed that the group had reformed under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan and were writing songs for a new album under Polydor. =2017‚Äìpresent: Solo projects and return to Sugababes= In March 2017, Buena started her own agency with friends. The agency is called Colour of Musiq. In 2018, Buena was featured on the track called ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù with Rockwell, JSTN and Rico Flames. She was also featured in the music video. Buena has also began undertaking various television projects. She appeared in an episode of MTV‚Äôs Just Tattoo of Us, and appeared in series 5 of Celebs Go Dating on E4. In 2019, she appeared on the fourth series of Celebrity Coach Trip alongside Lisa Maffia. In September 2019 Buena regained rights to the Sugababes name and rejoined the band alongside original members Keisha Buchanan and Siobhan Donaghy. They featured on a track on a DJ Spoony album and confirmed that they had plans to release new material and tour in 2020. The plans were later put on hold, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, she ranked as #2 among the best girl band members of all time, second only to American singer Beyonc√©. In February 2020, she released the single \\"Black Valentine\\", on which she has writing credit, in collaboration with London-based pop duo Electric Pineapple. Later that year, she teased an interest in releasing an R&B; album. Personal life In March 2010, Buena filed a claim for ownership of the Sugababes name with the European Trademark Authority. Though Buchanan and Donaghy's names appear on the trademark submission, it was confirmed that Buena was the sole applicant for submission and Donaghy and Buchanan were not involved. The fourth line-up launched an opposition to the claim on the basis that goodwill and reputation in the mark and trading name \\"Sugababes\\" belongs to the partnership ‚Äì not an individual. Buena has buttock implants and previously had breast enlargements. In November 2013, Buena had the implants removed. In September 2014, Buena was declared to be bankrupt by a High Court judge. In 2020, she criticized the media for not covering the fact that she instantly paid off her ¬£100,000 tax debts when she was made aware of the administrative error done by her accountants. Buena suffered from post-natal depression, following the birth of her daughter.

The route runs from U.S. Route 322 (US 322) in West Cornwall Township, Lebanon County north to PA 183 in Bethel Township, Berks County. The route heads east from US 322 through Quentin and Cornwall to Schaefferstown, where it turns east and passes through Newmanstown. PA 419 enters Berks County and passes through Womelsdorf, where it comes to a junction with US 422. From the route, the route continues north and passes through Rehrersburg and has an interchange with Interstate 78 (I-78)/US 22 near Schubert before coming to its northern terminus. PA 419 is a two-lane undivided road its entire length and passes through rural areas. The portion of the route in Lebanon County is designated the Lebanon Cornwall Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway. What is now PA 419 was designated as part of PA 5 between Quentin and Cornwall and part of PA 83 between Rehrersburg and north of Schubert in 1927. A year later, PA 483 was designated between US 22/PA 3 (now US 422) in Womelsdorf and PA 83 in Rehrersburg while PA 72 was designated concurrent with PA 5 between Quentin and Cornwall. US 322 replaced PA 5 in the 1930s. PA 483 was decommissioned in the 1940s. By 1960, PA 72 was shifted off the road between Quentin and Cornwall while PA 83 was moved off the road between Rehrersburg and Schubert, with US 322 removed from the road in 1963. PA 419 was designated by 1966 onto its current alignment. Route description PA 419 begins at an intersection with US 322 (Horseshoe Pike) in West Cornwall Township, Lebanon County, heading east on two-lane undivided Main Street. The route passes through the residential community of Quentin and comes to an intersection with PA 72 (Quentin Road). The road continues into the borough of Cornwall and becomes Freeman Drive, running through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. PA 419 crosses the Lebanon Valley Rail Trail before it turns to the northeast and enters South Lebanon Township, where the name becomes Schaeffer Road and it continues east through agricultural areas with occasional development in the southeastern portion of Lebanon County, which is home to an Amish community. The route enters Heidelberg Township and passes through the community of Buffalo Springs before it passes to the north of Keller Brothers Airport. The road runs through more rural land with some homes before it reaches the community of Schaefferstown. At this point, PA 419 comes to an intersection with PA 897 (South 5th Avenue), with that route turning east to join PA 419 in a concurrency along Heidelberg Avenue. The two routes cross PA 501 and continue east through residential areas with some businesses. PA 419 splits from PA 897 by turning north onto Market Street and passes more homes before leaving Schaefferstown. The road heads northeast into farmland with some trees and homes, crossing into Millcreek Township and becoming an unnamed road. The route curves east through more agricultural land before turning northeast again and passing through the communities of Millbach Springs and Millbach. PA 419 heads into the community of Newmanstown, where it is called Main Street and is lined with homes. After leaving Newmanstown, the road comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line. In Lebanon County, PA 419 is known as the Lebanon Cornwall Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway. PA 419 enters Heidelberg Township in Berks County and heads northeast through farmland on Newmanstown Road. The route turns north and heads into the borough of Womelsdorf, where it becomes South 2nd Street and is lined with homes. PA 419 turns west onto West High Street for a block before it heads north along North 3rd Street. The route runs past residences and commercial establishments before it reaches a junction with US 422 (Conrad Weiser Parkway) in an area of businesses. Past this intersection, the road becomes Rehrersburg Road and leaves Womelsdorf for Heidelberg Township again before it crosses the Tulpehocken Creek into Marion Township. PA 419 continues through agricultural areas before it curves northwest into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The road enters Tulpehocken Township and passes through the community of Host, continuing north-northwest. Near Rehrersburg, the route splits from Rehrersburg Road by turning north onto Four Point Road and heading through farmland with some trees and homes. PA 419 crosses Little Swatara Creek into Bethel Township and crosses Old Route 22 before it reaches an interchange with I-78/US 22 near a few businesses. Past this interchange, the road passes near farm fields and homes in Schubert before it enters forested areas at the base of Blue Mountain. PA 419 curves northeast and reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 183. History When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, the present-day route of PA 419 was not designated as a legislative route. At this time, the roadway was paved in Millcreek Township, while an unpaved road continued south to Schaefferstown and north to Legislative Route 149 in Womelsdorf. The portion of the route between Quentin and Cornwall was designated as part of PA 5 and the current route north of Rehrersburg was designated as part of PA 83 in 1927. In 1928, PA 483 was designated to run from US 22/PA 3 (now US 422) in Womelsdorf north to PA 83 in Rehrersburg along unpaved Rehrersburg Road. At this time, the segment of PA 5/PA 72 between Quentin and Cornwall and the segment of PA 83 between Rehrersburg and north of Schubert, along with the unnumbered road between Schaefferstown and Womelsdorf, was paved. The unnumbered road between Rexmont and Schaefferstown was unpaved. By 1930, the road between Cornwall and Schaefferstown along with the entire length of PA 483 were paved. In the 1930s, US 322 replaced the PA 5 designation that ran concurrent with PA 72 between Quentin and Cornwall. The PA 483 designation between US 422 in Womelsdorf and PA 83 in Rehrersburg was decommissioned in the 1940s. By 1960, PA 83 was shifted east to a new alignment through Strausstown, leaving the road between Rehrersburg and north of Schubert unnumbered. Also by this time, PA 72 was removed from US 322 between Quentin and Cornwall after it was moved to a new alignment between Quentin and Lebanon. In 1963, US 322 was shifted to bypass Cornwall along with PA 72, removing it from the road that ran between Quentin and Cornwall. PA 419 was designated by 1966 to run from US 322 in Quentin east and north to PA 183 north of Schubert along its current alignment. PA 419 and PA 897 previously ran concurrent with PA 501 in Schaefferstown between Stiegel Pike and Carpenter Street. In 2013, PA 501 was shifted to bypass Schaefferstown to the west along a new alignment, eliminating the concurrency with PA 419 and PA 897.

One of the world's pre-eminent singers specializing in Mozart and Rossini, Corbelli has sung in many major opera houses around the world and won admiration for his elegant singing style and sharp characterizations, especially in comic roles. Career and roles Corbelli was born in Turin, Italy in 1952 and studied with Giuseppe Valdengo and Claude Thiolas. He made his debut in 1973 (at the age of twenty-one) in Aosta, Italy as Monterone in Verdi's Rigoletto. Subsequently he appeared at La Scala in Milan (singing in all three of the Mozart/Da Ponte operas under conductor Riccardo Muti), and also in such cities as Turin, Verona, Bologna, Florence, and Naples, as well as major opera houses in Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany, England, Spain, Israel, and North and South America. At the beginning of his career Corbelli sang lyric baritone roles, but his natural talent for comedy caused him eventually to be typecast in comic parts. Among the buffo roles he has performed and/or recorded are Dr. Bartolo in Rossini‚Äôs Il barbiere di Siviglia, Taddeo in Rossini‚Äôs L'italiana in Algeri, Don Geronio in Rossini‚Äôs Il turco in Italia, Dr Dulcamara in Donizetti‚Äôs L'elisir d'amore, and the title role of Donizetti‚Äôs Don Pasquale. He has frequently showed his versatility by singing two roles from the same opera: Figaro and the Count in Mozart‚Äôs Le nozze di Figaro, Leporello and the title role in Mozart‚Äôs Don Giovanni, Guglielmo and Don Alfonso in Mozart‚Äôs Cos√¨ fan tutte, and Dandini and Don Magnifico in Rossini‚Äôs La Cenerentola, among others. At the Royal Opera House, as of March 2012, Corbelli had taken part in 87 performances since his debut in 1988 (as Taddeo in L'Italiana in Algeri). Corbelli's roles at the Royal Opera House have included Don Alfonso in Cos√¨ fan tutte (8 perf., 1997), Doctor Malatesta in Don Pasquale (8 perf., 2004; 5 perf. 2006), Don Magnifico in La Cenerentola (10 perf. 2007-2008), Doctor Bartolo in Il barbiere di Siviglia (6 perf., 2009), and Michonnet in Adriana Lecouvreur (8 perf., 2010). At the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, Corbelli performed 64 times, as of March 2012, since his debut in 1997, appearing 26 times as Dandini, 7 times as Dulcamara in L'elisir d'amore, 15 times in the title role of Gianni Schicchi, 8 times as Sergeant Sulpice in La Fille du Regiment, and 8 times as Taddeo in L'Italiana in Algeri. Although primarily associated with Italian-language comic roles, Corbelli‚Äôs r√©sum√© shows his wide-ranging interests and versatility, including French and German roles (Sulpice in Donizetti's La fille du regiment, Papageno in Mozart‚Äôs Die Zauberfl√∂te), Baroque opera (Seneca in Monteverdi‚Äôs L'incoronazione di Poppea) and a twentieth-century English-language opera (Nick Shadow in Stravinsky‚Äôs The Rake's Progress). He has also sung roles in later Italian comic operas, for instance the title roles in Verdi‚Äôs Falstaff and Puccini‚Äôs Gianni Schicchi. He is active in the concert hall as well, performing as a soloist in oratorios and vocal symphonies. On 26 November 2007, while in London rehearsing for La Cenerentola, Corbelli stepped in at the last minute for a production of L'elisir d'amore at the Royal Opera House, singing the role of Belcore for the second half of the opera from the side of the stage while Ludovic T√©zier, who had sung the first half with a throat infection, acted the role. Vocal style Although in recent years Corbelli has sometimes been billed as a bass- baritone, he has insisted that he is a baritone. Corbelli's voice is not large, but its dark coloring gives it power and heft. He possesses a tight vibrato and great flexibility in coloratura and patter. His diction is always razor-sharp and he points up the text brilliantly, particularly in recitatives. His stage presence is commanding and he excels in comic timing and subtle characterization.

Biography  The future lieutenant general was born November 9, 1898. He had one brother, Enrico, who also grew up to be a General in the Italian Air Force. Mario joined the Infantry in October 1917, and the next year earned the rank of second lieutenant. He received his pilot's license in 1926. The next year he became part of the General Staff, rising to Cabinet of the Defense Ministry in 1931. After Pezzi's record flight, he was decorated with the Gold Medal of Aeronautic Valor and promoted Colonel. Later he also became Commander of Aeronautics as well as Chief of the General Staff. From 1950-1955, Pezzi worked as Head of Cabinet of the Minister and, subsequently, General Secretary of Aeronautics. Broglio himself described that meeting with Pezzi: \\"In 1956, secretary-general of ITAF Pezzi, the man famous for his altitude flight records, asked me to replace the officer responsible for the ITAF Ammunition Research Unit, a branch of the Service dealing with rockets and missiles too. I answered that it was not my field, my field being airplanes, not rockets. Pezzi objected: \\"Then give me the name of some top brass who is expert in that field\\". I answered again no, I did not know anyone with such a capability. \\"Well, then the job is yours\\" was Pezzi's conclusion.  Record Flight  Pezzi established his record above Montecelio (Rome) aboard a Caproni Ca.161 biplane with a Piaggio motor and pressurised airtight cabin, wearing a special pressure suit picture and reaching a height of 17,083 m (56,047 ft). This record still stands today. On May 7, 1937, Pezzi took off from the Guidonia-Montecelio base in a Caproni Ca161 aircraft powered by a 14 cyl. double stellar engine supercharged by a double centrifugal 750 hp compressor. Piloting this aircraft he climbed to 15,655 m (51,362 ft). Pezzi wore a special electrically heated pressurized suit and an airtight helmet, just like a modern astronaut. In the Caproni hangars in the meantime work went on ceaselessly to produce a new version of the aircraft, the Ca161bis designed by engineer Verduzio. Its cockpit was embedded in an air-tight shell, the first one to be built in the history of flight. The great expectations on this machine were soon fulfilled: on October 22, 1938, Pezzi attained a new world record for altitude in a propeller-driven, piston-engined aircraft (17,083 m, 56,047 ft), a record still unbeaten today. Pezzi is rightly considered an aeronautics and astronautics pioneer in Italy not only for his altitude records: he was the man who chose Luigi Broglio to lead the ITAF Ammunition Research Unit, responsible for rockets and missiles research, leading the way to future space exploration in Italy In those years Americans, Germans, English and French fought for this record, and Italy entered the contest with 14,433 m (47,355 ft) in 1934 from Donates on his Caproni Ca.113 with a Pegaso motor. In 1936, the Englishman Francis Swain achieved 15,230 m (49,970 ft) with a Bristol 138; but in the same year Pezzi surpassed this, reaching 15,635 m (51,300 ft) aboard a Ca.161. In 1937, the Englishman M.J. Adam in his turn exceeded it with 16,440 m (53,940 ft) to edge ahead once again in the Bristol 138. On October 22 of the following year, Pezzi achieved his still-valid world record for propeller aircraft with a height of 17,083 m (56,046.6 feet). As a young man, Pezzi had entered a career in aeronautics, becoming a pilot, and in 1934 he had been named commander of the unit for the record flight from Montecelio. He became a high official and received many decorations. In the post-war period he was general secretary of Aeronautics and subsequently head of Cabinet of the Defense Ministry.

The Olza River flows through the village. Part of the river with its alluvium and surroundings is a unique environment with a fragile nature balance. In an otherwise industrialized and densely populated region, it is quite special, and hence is protected.  History  The village was first mentioned in 1362 as Wernersdorf. The name indicates ethnically German settlement. It was later polonised (Wiernyerzowicze in 1447), but also regermanized as Wilmersdorf (1804), the name actually not connected to Wernersdorf. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

The Society was also the first library to be incorporated in Ohio. The Society was dissolved in 1821 and books were sold at auction. In 1847, the Dayton Library Association was established. This lasted until 1860 when it merged with the Public School Library, founded in 1855. In 1887 it was organized as a school district library. A new building was opened in Cooper Park in January 1888. Bookmobile service began in October 1923. In 1948, the library changed in legal form from a school district library to a county district library. In November 1956, the library officially changed its name to the Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library. A new $2.3 million building was constructed for the Main Library in 1960, with groundbreaking taking place on August 29. The new building, adjacent to the old building (since razed), opened on March 26, 1962, and is still in use today (albeit with renovations done in 1987 and 1998‚Äì2000).

US 99 was decommissioned during the 1964 highway renumbering and the highway was maintained by Whatcom County until it was designated as SR 548 in 1991. Route description I-5 northbound approaching the northern terminus of SR 548 in Blaine. SR 548 begins north of Ferndale at a diamond interchange with I-5, signed as exit 266. The highway travels west on Grandview Road, crossing over a railroad carrying the BNSF Railway's Bellingham Subdivision, and passes through a rural area while following Fingalson Creek. SR 548 passes north of Lake Terrell and part of the Whatcom Wildlife Area before crossing another set of railroad tracks and reaching the Cherry Point Refinery complex, the state's largest oil refinery. The highway turns north onto Blaine Road at a roundabout near the complex's main entrance, located east of Birch Bay State Park. SR 548 continues north through the beach community of Birch Bay, overlooking a section of Boundary Bay. The highway then crosses over California Creek near the Loomis Trail Golf Club and Dakota Creek at the southern city limit of Blaine. The highway crosses over the BNSF Bellingham Subdivision and turns northwest onto Peace Portal Drive, traveling parallel to I-5 and the railroad through Blaine. The highway and the railroad move onto the shore of Drayton Harbor, part of Semiahmoo Bay, and travel north through downtown Blaine. SR 548 reaches its terminus at a dogbone interchange with I-5, signed as exit 276, near the city's marina, approximately from the Peace Arch crossing of the Canadian border. The interchange also includes ramps to D Street, which continues east to SR 543, and 2nd Street, which connects to a parking lot for Peace Arch State Park. SR 548 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey of average traffic volume on state highways that is measured in terms of average annual daily traffic. Traffic volumes on SR 548 range from a minimum of 2,100 vehicles near the Cherry Point Refinery to a maximum of 12,000 vehicles near its Ferndale terminus. History SR 548 between Birch Bay and Blaine follows the route of a wagon road built in the 1900s parallel to a Great Northern rail line. The wagon road was codified in 1913 as the northernmost segment of the Pacific Highway, which later became State Road 1 during a 1923 restructuring of the highway system. The United States Numbered Highways were created in 1926 and US 99 was assigned to the Pacific Highway, becoming concurrent with the entire highway, which was replaced by PSH 1 in 1937. PSH 1 and US 99 were replaced during the 1964 highway renumbering by I-5 and Peace Portal Drive was removed from the highway system. SR 548 was created in 1991 from Peace Portal Drive, Blaine Road, and Grandview Road between Ferndale and Blaine in the last major revision of the highway. In 2010, WSDOT improved the I-5 interchange in Blaine at a cost of $13.2 million by converting it to a dogbone interchange using two new roundabouts.

Design and development Designed by Fairchild Aircraft as a replacement for current primary trainers, the XNQ-1 was the fastest primary trainer to date. The Model M-92 featured a controllable-pitch propeller, flaps, electronically operated retractable landing gear and all-metal skin with fabric-covered rudder, ailerons and elevators. Its unobstructed bubble canopy provided instructors and students seated in tandem with good visibility, and its cockpit instruments were arranged to match those found in contemporary jet fighters. To help students recognize controls, the landing gear handle was in the shape of a small landing gear wheel, and the flap handle was shaped like the airfoil of a flap. Operational history The XNQ-1 basic/advanced trainer was developed for the U.S. Navy and was first flown by Richard Henson on 7 October 1946. Two prototypes were flown as XNQ-1 (BuNo. 75725 & 75726). Delivered to the U.S. Navy in 1947 for trials, they were rejected due to problems with exhaust fumes leaking into the cockpit. The first prototype was subsequently to receive a number of engine changes, first powered with a 320 hp Lycoming R-680-13, then finally with a horizontally opposed 350 hp Lycoming GSO-580. The aircraft was destroyed in a crash in 1950. The second aircraft (BuNo. 75726), with a larger stabilizer, was evaluated by the USAF in 1949 as a replacement for the AT-6, with the USAF selecting it on 24 March 1949 as a primary trainer. Designed to be aerobatic to teach pilots maneuvers, such as stalls, spins and rolls, Fairchild received a contract for 100 model 129s under the USAF designation T-31. However, the order was cancelled later in 1949, in favor of the Beech T-34 Mentor. Fairchild dropped plans to develop the design as the company concentrated on other production contracts, including the C-119 Flying Boxcar.

The route runs from U.S. Route 422 (US 422) in Myerstown, Lebanon County north to PA 443 in Pine Grove Township, Schuylkill County. PA 645 heads north from Myerstown into agricultural areas and enters Berks County, where it passes through Frystown and comes to an interchange with Interstate 78 (I-78)/US 22. Past here, the route heads across forested Blue Mountain and continues into Schuylkill County, where it reaches its northern terminus. PA 645 is a two-lane undivided road its entire length. The road was paved for a short distance north of Myerstown by 1928. The paved portion was extended to Frystown in the 1930s and north of there by 1953. PA 645 was designated onto its current alignment in 1962. Route description PA 645 begins at an intersection with US 422 at the north edge of the borough of Myerstown in Lebanon County, where North Locust Street heads south into Myerstown. From this intersection, the route heads north on two-lane undivided North Locust Street into Jackson Township, passing near residential neighborhoods. PA 645 runs through agricultural areas with some homes, curving northwest briefly before turning north again onto Kutztown Road. The road passes through the residential community of Kutztown before it heads back into farmland. The route turns east onto East Rosebud Road before it heads north onto Hilltop Road, passing through a mix of farms and residential development and curving northwest. The route enters Tulpehocken Township in Berks County and becomes Camp Swatara Road, running north-northwest through agricultural areas with some homes and commercial development. PA 645 crosses the Little Swatara Creek into Bethel Township, where it turns north. The road passes through the residential community of Frystown, where it intersects Frystown Road, before running through more farmland. The route passes near businesses and comes to an interchange with I-78/US 22. Past this interchange, the road heads through farmland and woodland with some homes. PA 645 turns to the west and enters forested areas, where it begins to ascend Blue Mountain. The route turns to the north and continues to climb the mountain, heading to the northeast. At the summit of Blue Mountain, PA 645 crosses the Appalachian Trail and heads into Pine Grove Township in Schuylkill County. At this point, the name becomes Geary Wolf Road and the road winds north to descend the forested mountain. At the bottom of the mountain, the route heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, passing through the community of Brookside. PA 645 passes near residences and an industrial park, crossing Swatara Creek before it reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 443 south of the borough of Pine Grove. History When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, present-day PA 645 was not given a legislative number. By 1928, the road from Myerstown to a point north of Kutztown was paved while the remainder was unpaved; at this time the road was unnumbered. The road was paved north to Frystown in the 1930s. By 1953, the road north of Frystown was paved. PA 645 was designated on April 17, 1962 to run between US 422 in Myerstown and PA 443 near Pine Grove. The route was created in order to provide a route number at the Frystown interchange of I-78/US 22. PA 645 has remained on the same alignment since it was designated.

Previously known as the Baku Air Defence Corps, its main objective became sheltering the Baku oil fields from German raids. The Wehrmacht had been planning the capture of the oil field under the codename Operation Edelweiss.

His reign was from 1785 to 1823, a period of 38 years (42 years including his period as disciple of Swami ShankarƒÅshram II). He became the head of the community after his teacher(guru) Swami ShankarƒÅshram died in 1785. Under his administration, the Chitrapur Math acquired land and property. He was able to consolidate the SƒÅraswat Community both in numbers(increased the number of followers) and in faith (weaned away many from Dvaita Vaishnava practises). He died in 1823 at Shirali. His samƒÅdhi(shrine) is located at Shirali. (Note: In this article Swamiji will refer only to Swami KeshavƒÅshram) Taking charge Swami KeshavƒÅshram became the Fifth head of the community after his teacher (guru) Swami ShankarƒÅshram II attained MahƒÅ-samƒÅdhi in 1785 in the month of Maagha. The official taking over took place on the tenth day of the month. Swamiji had the advantage of being under his guru for 4 years and could hence could easily take charge of the administration of the ChitrƒÅpur Matha and the community in general. Swamiji was a very able administrator and he could acquire land and fixed property for the ChitrƒÅpur Matha. This resulted in the expansion of the matha. He would personally supervise the administration and finance of the matha whenever he had the spare time. He was well versed with the scriptures but at the same time had a keen mathematical prowess. In the 42 years in charge with the matha administration(38 years as the MathƒÅdhipati and 4 as disciple to his guru), he could consolidate the community as a whole. He was considered as a good orator. The knowledge and the speaking skills were very convincing and devotees flocked to hear his discourses. \\"Poojya Swamiji,truly a JnƒÅni With Spiritual Knowledge did glow, Discourses filled with wisdom, So smoothly would flow! Devotees flocked to listen to the words of wisdom, Our beloved Sadguru they came to meet, In abundance they received from Gurudev, With reverence they prostrated at His Lotus Feet.\\" Swamiji could convince many devotees from getting rid of their Dvaita Vaishnava practices. Thus many devotees were united under the Guru Parampara and bore allegiance to the ChitrƒÅpur Matha. The devotees never failed to pay a portion of their income to Swamiji and thus the financial stability, that the matha had lacked for so long, was achieved. Importance to education During Swamiji's reign, the British got hold of the Canara Districts(Upper and Lower) (See: British control) where the community was primarily located. Knowing that changing times demanded changes in society, Swamiji encouraged English education. Thus the SƒÅraswats could occupy prestigious administrative posts during the British Raj. Miracles Swami KeshavƒÅshram is attributed to many miracles. Devotees in distress and in need had their problems redressed due to his divine powers. Two of them are listed below. =The Mute boy from Murdeshwar= There lived a pious devotee in the town of Murdershwar who had a son who was mute. This devotee and his wife tried all sorts of therapy and medication to get the boy to speak, but all that failed. When all hopes seemed to dim, his wife and neighbours asked him to take his son to seek Swamiji's blessings. But this devotee was so pious and considerate that he refused stating that he did not want his burdens to be transferred to Swamiji in any way. One day both he and his wife had a dream where Swamiji had blessed their son and he was normal again. Since both of them had the same dream, they thought the message was too strong to ignore. So with hopes filled in their hearts, they went to Shirali to meet Swamiji. The entire family prayed in utmost humility to Swamiji. The boy was weeping bitterly but silently beside Swamiji. When Swamiji placed his hand on the boy's head, the boy miraculously got back his power of speech. The family was then blessed by Swamiji and they returned to Murdeshwar. =The Cripple from Mangalore= In the town of Mangalore lived a pious devotee of Swamiji who was physically challenged (feet had a disability). He lived on the charity of people but was truly devout. He had an ardent desire to seek blessings of Swamiji. Despite not having any money or food with him, he started his journey to the Chitrapur Math on barefoot. Even though his clothes were tattered and poor, his heart was rich with devotion. En route his feet got swollen and his knees became very tired. With all his energy sapped and the destination still far away, the poor man rested under a Banyan tree very dejected and doubtful of completing his journey. At night he had a dream where Swamiji came to him under the Banyan tree and was massaging his tired feet with oil. At dawn when he woke up, all the pain and agony had disappeared and he could walk normally. With his health and spirits re-energized, the devotee made his way to Swamiji at Shirali and fell at his feet with true devotion. The Swamiji blessed him and the devotee returned with content and happiness. Shishya SweekƒÅr When Swamiji's health started becoming frail and weak, the devotees requested Swamiji to accept a shishya(Disciple). Swamiji graciously accepted the offer. So the search was on to find a suitable successor. The suitable successor was found in a youngster from the Shukla Bhat family from Shirali. On the Shuddha Panchami (5th day) of the AshƒÅdhƒÅ month in 1804, the new shishya was ordained as VƒÅmanƒÅshram. He would be under the tutelage of Swami KeshavƒÅshram for another 19 years. This long period of being under a guru helped VƒÅmanƒÅshram attain high proficiency in the Sanskrit scriptures. Death After being the head of the community for 38 long years, Swami KeshavƒÅshram died on the Shƒ´rsha Navami(9th day) of the MƒÅrgha month in 1823. He died with his shishya by his side. His samƒÅdhi(shrine) is located at Shirali.

The Detroit News History Following the loss of the Schooner Pride in 1866, public outcries for a light at this locale were finally heard and heeded. Congress approved funding in 1871, but construction was delayed until 1874 due to lack of roads to the site. Undated USCG photo The station was originally named \\"Petite Pointe Au Sable Lighthouse\\", which is the name used on most official records; officially, however, the name was changed in 1910.Tag, Thomas A., Little Sable Point Light Station, Softcover (Dayton, OH: Data Image, 1996) p. 6. Although commonly called \\"Little Sable Point Light\\", it is listed by the National Park Service as \\"Little Point Sable Light\\". The lantern room has eight fixed panels in its lower section, and the upper has ten rotating panels. In 1954, the Lighthouse keeper's dwelling was destroyed by the Coast Guard when electricity reached the site and the light was automated. \\"Evidence of the connection between the dwelling and tower are obvious to the visitor.\\" Prior to 1900, the brick was left in its natural color and state, as it was unusually hard and held up well to the elements. (Unlike its sister, Big Sable Point Light, which was made from Cream City Brick, and had to be encased in steel boilerplate to retard the deterioration.) Having it in natural tones, however, was a boon to the Lighthouse keeper, who did not have to apply a yearly coat of whitewash. In 1900 the light was painted white for the first time, to assuage the complaints of mariners who said the brick was difficult to see. It remained that color until 1975, when it was sand blasted, and returned to its natural color. The lantern is capped by a copper roof. Big Sable Point Lighthouse (erected in 1867) is the same height, and is several miles to the north. It is distinguishable at night from Little Sable by having a fixed white light, and by day by the Daymark of the tower, being banded in black and white. For the first time in over 50 years (last open in 1949), in June, 2006, the lighthouse opened to the public, so they can now climb its 139 steps and view the Third Order Fresnel lens (manufactured by Sautter & Co. of Paris) and the panoramic landscape. It is open everyday, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. from the first weekend in June through the end of September.Neushwander, Alan, Little Sable Point Lighthouse Opens To The Public, Jun. 02 2006, WKLA. The presence and continuous use of the original Third Order Fresnel lens makes this a relatively rare light. This is one of only seventy such lenses that are still operational in the United States, sixteen of which are use on the Great Lakes of which eight are in Michigan.Merkel, Jan, Family Memories of Little Sable Point Light Station, January, 2001, Lighthouse Digest.

It reteamed William Holden and Nancy Olson in the third of their four movies together (Sunset Boulevard, Union Station, and Submarine Command being the others), all released in 1950 or 1951. An American infantryman on leave and a Women's Army Corps (WAC) officer fall in love. Plot After hard fighting in the Battle of San Pietro, the infantrymen of the American 36th Division are given five days of much needed rest. Sergeant Joe \\"Pete\\" Peterson (William Holden) meets WAC Lieutenant Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" MacKay (Nancy Olson) in a cemetery. However, his attempts to become better acquainted are brushed off. Later, Pete's friend and commanding officer, Major Blackford (Frank Lovejoy), tells him he has been given a battlefield commission and is now a second lieutenant. When Sergeant McFee (Gene Evans) becomes upset because he has not received a letter from his wife in a long time, Pete takes him to the post office to investigate, and finds Ellie working there. This time, Ellie offers to buy Pete a drink in celebration of his promotion. Although he agrees, she still tries to keep things from becoming serious, revealing that she almost married another soldier, except he was killed, and does not want to risk falling in love again. However, when the division's leave is cut short, she cannot stay away. Pete gets her to agree to marry him on his next leave. Blackford assigns Pete and his platoon to take out a German roadblock. Pete spots two deadly German 88 guns commanding the road on which American tanks are advancing. However, when one of his men urges him to attack the guns, Pete rejects the idea; with Ellie on his mind, he has become overcautious. The 88s knock out the lead American tank, from which Blackford is directing the attack. The major is killed. Pete himself is wounded by an artillery barrage and wakes up in a hospital. Blaming himself for his friend's death (even though he knows he could not have reached the guns in time anyway), Pete sinks into a depression, unwilling to see anyone. A visit from Ellie brings him out of it. Pete tells her that he has been given a three-day leave before being sent back to the United States, safely out of combat. Together out in the countryside, they get married. However, Pete's guilt makes him decide to rejoin his unit. Ellie does not try to stop him. Afterward, she discovers she is pregnant, which means she will have to leave the army. Pete is hit when he reconnoiters ahead, and his men are ordered to retreat, leaving him behind. Unwilling to believe her husband is dead, Ellie searches everywhere for him without success. When Rome is liberated, she finds him; he had been taken prisoner, but was freed when the Germans retreated.

Variations of this traditional healthy vegetarian diet exist throughout the world, particularly in parts of North America, Europe, South America, and most notably, Asia. Given these carefully defined parameters, the phrase \\"Traditional Vegetarian Diet\\" is used here to represent the healthy traditional ovo-lacto vegetarian diets of these regions and peoples. A pyramid was created by Oldways Preservation Trust in 1998 with scientific research from Cornell and Harvard University and specific reference to the healthy patterns of eating demonstrated by the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid. This Vegetarian Diet Pyramid suggests the types and frequencies of foods that should be enjoyed for health. The pyramid is divided into daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies, but does not recommend serving sizes. The pyramid also has recommendations for daily physical activity and hydration. Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Department of Nutrition developed The Vegetarian Food Pyramid in 1997 for presentation at the 3rd International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition. The five major plant-based food groups (whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds) form the trapezoid-shaped lower portion of the pyramid. Optional food groups (vegetable oils, dairy, and sweets) form the triangle-shaped top portion of the pyramid. This version of the pyramid includes a table with recommended number of daily servings per daily calorie intake. According to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, healthful diets contain the amounts of essential nutrients and energy needed to prevent nutritional deficiencies and excesses. Healthful diets also provide the right balance of carbohydrates, fat, and protein to reduce risks for chronic diseases, and they are obtained from a variety of foods that are available, affordable, and enjoyable. Meat contains complete proteins, but vegetarian protein sources are incomplete proteins and therefore a variety of protein rich foods must be consumed to create a complete protein profile. This method of combining a balance of incomplete vegetarian proteins to create a complete protein profile is known as complementary protein building. The healthfulness of this pattern has been corroborated by epidemiological and experimental nutrition.

He is considered by many as the father of modern Greek classical music. Life Leontaritis was born in 1518 in Crete, son of the Greek catholic priest Nikolaos Leondaritis and his mistress Maria Siminopoula. After solving the problems of legitimacy, Nikolaos promoted Francisco to priesthood. In 1535 he is found as priest in the catholic church of Saint Tito (Hagios Titos) of Candia. Between 1537 and 1544 he was the organ player in the same church. It is not known how he studied music. In 1544 he appears to be a composer. He was an established musician and moved from Crete to Italy to study Renaissance polyphonic music. In 1549, because of his good voice, he became member of the famous choir of St. Mark in Venice under the direction of Adrian Willaert. He was a student of some of the greatest musicians of his time like Orlande de Lassus and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. He established a reputation very quickly in Venice as a very capable composer and singer (cantore). He was thus invited to sing in churches in Rome and Padova. He was summoned to perform often at houses of nobles such as Antonio Zantani. His acquaintance with Nikolaus Stopius and through him to the German banker Jakob Fugger led him to Bavaria in Munich. He also worked as a composer in Augsburg and Salzburg. In 1568 he returned to Crete possibly to avoid his debts. He worked as organ player and teacher of music in St. Titus. He probably died in 1572. Work He was established in music dictionaries as \\"il Greco\\" (The Greek). He composed three masses and twenty one motets, madrigals and napolitans. From his work only three masses have survived until today; namely: Missa super Aller mi faut, Missa super Je prens en grez and Missa super Letatus sum.

He was part of a young group of artists in the 1950s and 1960s who raised awareness of the artistic consciousness of African tradition in an emerging and nascent social milieu. He is sometimes considered one of the pioneers of Nigerian contemporary art. In 1966, he opened Nigeria's first contemporary art gallery in Kakawa street, Lagos. He was very successful in door carvings and was commissioned to carve doors for prominent firms and individuals such as the Cooperative Bank building at Ibadan and the House of Parliament in Lagos. Early life and education Felix Idubor was born to the family of a farmer in Benin city. He started carving at an early age, but met some resistance from his father who felt carving was not a financially productive career choice. He began his education at a primary school in Benin but later took a break from studies to concentrate on what he felt was his natural choice of occupation, carving. His first artistic choice of subject focused on birds usually carved in wood from the Iroko tree which were numerous in Benin.Y. A. Grillo; Juliet Highet. 'Felix Idubor', African Arts, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Autumn, 1968), p. 34. He also used the wood from the iroko tree as tools in other carving projects and was quite successful in his chosen path. By the age of seventeen, he was appointed a tutor at the Edo College in Benin with little formal training.Grillo and Highet p. 31. In the late 1950s, he earned a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art, London after his work gained critical acclaim during an exhibition to coincide with Queen Elizabeth's visit to Nigeria. Sculptor After the end of World War II, he left the city of Benin and moved to Lagos. However, Lagos which was then the seat of government was also an emerging economic and trade center with high standards of living. To fend for himself, Idubor turned to making tourist craft for sales to African traders and foreign tourists while also finding time to tend to his artistic and later distinctive vision of wood carvings.Grillo and Highet p 31. Although, the African tourism craft form was sometimes called traducible by some, the popularity with tourists and the effort put into training and making the craft encouraged the collecting of African art works. By 1953, Idubor was able to hold an exhibition of his wood sculptures at the Nigerian Exhibition Center. The exhibition gave him visibility and exposure; a few of his works were bought by American collectors. His work also attracted critical attention. However, it was an exhibition opened by the Nigerian governor-general, James Robertson which was held to coincide with the visit of Queen Elizabeth that gave him increased exposure. Included in the gift presented to the queen was an Idubor wood carving. In due time, he was later a teacher at a college in Yaba and was given a scholarship to study in London. Door carvings After returning from London, he was given his first major project, to design a door for the new Cooperative Bank building in Ibadan. The architect brought in to work on the building chose Idubor for his taste in and talent in carving. Idubor chose a design of three crops carved in wood, the three crops signified the three main regions of Nigeria. The palm fruit for the Eastern region, cocoa for the Western region and groundnut for the Northern region. The carvings were well received and further opened avenues for new clients who appreciated his work. He later worked with the office of the Oba of Lagos on a wood carving for a palace door and also with the Nigerian parliament. Other works He also succeeded in other material subjects and also experimented with bronze sculptors and concrete casting.CAROL MAGEE. Idubor, Felix, Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed on June 21, 2007. His carving of a Yoruba girl was on display at the Nigerian House, London and some of his works hanged as ornaments on the walls of the National Hall, Lagos.

II s. 77Mykhailovskyi, V. Podlaskie Voivodeship (–ü–Ü–î–õ–Ø–°–¨–ö–ï –í–û–Ñ–í–û–î–°–¢–í–û). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine After Lithuania's union with the Kingdom of Poland in 1569 and formation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the voivodeship was transferred to the Polish Crown, where it belonged to the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Description In ca. 1274, the historical Podlasie region was added to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1391 the Polish King and Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila attempted to transfer the region to Duke Vytautas' brother-in-law, Janusz I of Warsaw, Duke of Masovia, but from 1413 on Podlaskie was managed as part of the Grand Duchy's Trakai Voivodeship. After the administrative reform of 1514, Podlaskie was isolated from Trakai Voivodeship as a separate voivodeship, with the capital at the town of Drohiczyn. King of Poland Sigismund gave a privilege to Iwan Sapieha to form a government of Podlaskie Voivodeship on 29 August 1513. It originally consisted of following former Trakai lands Drohoczin, Mielnik, Bielsk, and Brzesc. In 1566 based on Brzesc lands there was formed separate Brest Litovsk Voivodeship. In 1569, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus transferred Podlaskie voivodeship, together with the Kiev, Volyn and Braclaw Voivodeships to the Polish Crown. Podlaskie remained part of Poland until the Partitions of Poland. In 1795 it was divided between the Kingdom of Prussia (north) and Russian Empire (lunch), but in 1807 its whole territory was annexed by Russia, where it remained in 1918. Zygmunt Gloger gives the following description of Podlasie Voivodeship: \\"Historic Podlasie stretched from north to south for some 30 miles, and was located between Mazovia and Rus principalities of Brzesc and Grodno (...) It was a sparsely populated province, covered by dense forests, with four major rivers: the Biebrza, the Narew, the Bug and the Krzna. Due to population growth in Mazovia and Rus, Podlasie became a settlement area - Mazovians settled near Tykocin, Rajgrod and Goniadz, while Ruthenians settled near Bielsk Podlaski. In northern districts of Podlasie, near Augustow, the Yotvingians resided (...) After the 1241 Mongol invasion of Poland, Podlasie turned into a desert, with population decimated by Asiatic hordes. Poles did not return here until the late 13th century, despite the fact that the province was already controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (...) King Sigismund I the Old created Podlasie Voivodeship, which was part of Lithuania, but in 1569 was transferred to Poland, after the Union of Lublin (...) After the third partition of Poland, most of the voivodeship was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. When in 1815, Congress Poland was divided into new provinces, the Podlasie Voivodeship was re-created, but it covered only a small part of Podlasie itself, together with areas belonging to historic Mazovia, Polesie and Lesser Poland. As a result, boundaries of Podlasie proper changed. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the voivodeship had two senators, who were the voivode and the castellan of Podlasie. It was divided into three lands, those of Drohiczyn, Bielsko and Mielnik. Each land had its own regional government, and elected two envoys to the Sejm. Furthermore, the voivodeship sent two deputies to the Lesser Poland Tribunal at Lublin or Radom\\". Administrative Subdivisions The Voivodeship consisted of the following ziemias: * Bielsk Land (), Bielsk). Local sejmiks took place in Bielsk, where the szlachta elected two deputies of the Sejm, * Drohiczyn Land (), Drohiczyn).

It was designated as Ireland's first Marine Nature Reserve in 1981.  Features  Lough Hyne was probably a freshwater lake until about four millennia ago (2000 BC, during the Atlantic Bronze Age), when rising sea levels flooded it with saline ocean water. The lake is now fed by tidal currents that rush in from the Atlantic through Barloge Creek. The stretch between the creek and the lake is known as \\"The Rapids.\\" The lake's small size, only 0.8 km by 0.6 km, creates an unusual habitat of highly oxygenated yet warm seawater that sustains an enormous variety of plants and animals, many of which are not found anywhere else in Ireland. A wide variety of environments such as cliffs, salt marsh, beach, and areas of greatly varying water movement add to the area's biodiversity. Some of the seawalls around the lake and the Rapids were built as relief work during the Great Hunger. Scientific investigation of the area began in 1886 when Rev. William Spottswood Green first recorded the presence of the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Prof. Louis Renouf resumed the scientific work in 1923 and promoted it as a 'biological station' and sustained studies have been carried out there since then. It is now one of the most-studied sites of its size in the world. Several laboratories were constructed near the shores of the lake, supporting ground-breaking ecological research under Prof. Jack Kitching and Dr John Ebling. An illustrated history of the marine research was published in 2011 'Lough Hyne: The Marine Researchers - in Pictures'. The area is a tourist attraction with a permanent exhibition on the lough and its importance at nearby Skibbereen Heritage Centre. The ruins of Saint Bridgit's Church are on the shores of the lake, as well as holy wells, Tobar√≠n S√∫l and Skour Well, on the side of Knockomagh Hill. Castle Island is located in the center of the lake where the ruins of Cloghan Castle, once a fortress of the O'Driscoll clan, are still visible. A nature trail up Knockomagh Hill offers superb views of the lough and the surrounding area. Lough Hyne is a popular kayaking and swimming destination for locals and tourists in the summer.

Life & music career Valete was born in Lisbon, where he was raised in the Benfica neighborhood. He traveled to Arroja, returned to Benfica, then moved to Amadora and finally settled in Damaia. From a young age he developed strong politic opinions, influenced by his Philosophy teacher at school. During his youth he maintained relations with the JCP (Portuguese Communist Youth) and the PCP (Portuguese Communist Party). However, in the same interview he admitted that despite being a party in which he identifies himself ideologically, he has issues its structure and social agendas. Thus, he prefers to embrace the Bloco de Esquerda (Left Block), because it's closer to his political references.

He continued with Canal 115 for 2 more years constantly performing in his country, but then decided to dedicate himself to his studies, getting a degree in Economics at the Lisbon School of Economics & Management (ISEG).

Castle Rock Brewery is a brewery and pub group based in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire. It was originally set up as a joint venture with Bramcote Brewery. Bramcote Brewery was wound up and a new company was set up, 50% owned by Tynemill and 50% owned by the previous owners of Bramcote Brewery, on a new site next to Tynemill‚Äôs pub, The Vat and Fiddle, located on Queensbridge road close to Nottingham railway station. The Vat and Fiddle became the ‚ÄòBrewery Tap‚Äô, serving over 10 real ales at any one time, several of which are Castle Rock's. Following slow beginnings Castle Rock Brewery grew steadily, and in 2001 Tynemill bought out the other shareholders and Castle Rock Brewery became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tynemill. A new head brewer was recruited ‚Äì Pete Wooding, and the brewery was expanded with new equipment which led to the development of new brands. A few years later the head brewer was changed, and the brewery recruited Adrian Redgrove in 2004. After his appointment, the brewery went from strength to strength and began winning awards for various brews, largely brought about by Adrian Redgrove's skill and consistency. Castle Rock Brewery had been brewing at capacity for over a year and the decision was made in 2009 to build a new brewery in adjoining property, giving Castle Rock Brewery a potential capacity of 300+ barrels per week. The brewery expansion came into place only shortly after one of Castle Rock's regular brews, Harvest Pale, won Supreme Champion Beer of Britain at the Great British Beer Festival. Production has grown over the years from 35 barrels per week in 2003, to 115‚Äì120 barrels per week in 2009‚Äì10, to 300+ barrels per week in their newly expanded brewery in 2010.

The brewery also produces a range of one-off beers, named the \\"Traffic Street Specials\\" which focus on experimenting with flavours, ideas and the process of brewing itself. The majority of Castle Rock beers are fined, which means they are not vegan friendly. However, the brewery normally produces one wheat beer a year which is unfined and naturally cloudy; suitable for vegans. The Traffic Street Specials (the spin-off series of experimental brews) are also unfined and vegan friendly.

The Royal Navy ordered Ledburys construction two days after the outbreak of the Second World War and J. I. Thornycroft Ltd laid down her keel at their Southampton yard on 24 January 1940. Air raid damage to the yard delayed her construction and she did not launch until 27 September 1941. Her initial assignment was to perform escort duties between Scapa Flow and Iceland. She remained in this theatre for the first part of the war, during which time she served with the ill-fated Arctic convoy PQ 17 in June 1942, from which twenty-four ships were lost.Roger Hill, Destroyer Captain (Periscope Publishing 2004) Only two months later she took up the role of close escort in the Pedestal convoy to Malta. During the fierce attacks that dogged the convoy, Ledbury claimed three enemy aircraft destroyed and five damaged, and was one of three destroyers that helped the crippled oil tanker Ohio into the Grand Harbour. She added to her battle honours with the Allied landings in Sicily, Salerno, and operations in the Adriatic and Aegean. The Royal Navy finally scrapped Ledbury in 1958. Early service record =The Arctic convoy PQ 17= Ledbury was engaged in escorting major warships and Fleet auxiliaries in the North Sea until late June 1942, when she was attached to the ocean escort of the convoy PQ 17. Mariners that took part in convoys delivering supplies to Russia remember vividly the biting cold and the continual fear of attack by air or sea. The supplies were vital in that they were needed to keep Russia in the war following her invasion by German forces in 1941. The PQ 17 convoy, which left Iceland at the end of June 1942, is known particularly for the tremendous losses among the merchant ships. The problems for convoy PQ 17 started early on the morning of 4 July 1942, with the appearance of a copper-yellow warhead of a torpedo, clearly visible just below the surface of the sea. The freighter sounded her siren to warn the leading ships in column eight, but it was too late: the weapon was heading straight for the midship section of the Liberty ship , at the head of that column.La Malouines signal log The ship's Armed Guard ordered the machine guns to be turned on the torpedo racing towards them. Newports merchant seamen loading the guns lost their nerve and scrambled to the ship's port side. One gunner remained at his post, directing bullets at the torpedo; but these were deflected by the water. The torpedo slammed into the ship's engine-room, tearing a gaping hole and knocking the steering gear out of action with an enormous explosion. The helpless ship was yawing out of control across the sixth and seventh columns of the convoy, narrowly missing collisions with other ships, before she lurched round in the opposite direction to that of the convoy and slowed to a standstill.Interviews with Commander J. Rankin (Dianella) and Commander P. L. Newstead, January 1963 The surviving ships rolled past her, and the convoy sped on in the fog. Christopher Newport (code-number in the convoy, 'Penway' ) wirelessed the leading ship : 'Hit by aerial torpedo.' The Convoy Commander, Jack Broome, ordered Ledbury, and to '... take all possible action to keep U-boats down.'Irving, p. 86 Ledbury was one of the ships chosen to stay behind to tend to, and if necessary scuttle, the torpedoed ship and they themselves could have been an easy target to any submarines; however, none of the U-boats had maintained contact with the convoy. Escorts and merchant ships at Hvalfjord before the sailing of Convoy PQ 17 The next front action for Ledbury came later on that day, at 08:20, when the destroyer began signalling, 'Eight air torpedo-bombers 210 degrees, five miles', and then two minutes later, 'for eight read ten'.Irving, p. 102 Suddenly after Ledburys signals, all the escorts seemed to be blinking morse-signals at once. The loudspeakers were booming, 'Bombers approaching ... there's six of them ... there's twelve ... there's eighteen ... good God, there's twenty-five!' The anti-aircraft ship lurched forward and altered course to head off the attack. Commodore Dowding signalled Keppel to ask if the convoy should make an 'emergency turn'; but it was deemed too late for such a manoeuvre, since half the ships would most likely miss the signal altogether and Broome flashed back, 'I do not think it worth it.'Commodore Dowding's Report. The developing air attack spotted by Ledbury turned into a blitz of the convoy, with Luftwaffe aircraft being shot down over the formation, and one plane crashed into the sea about four thousand yards from the destroyer , on the convoy's starboard bow. The crash occurred not far from Ledbury and seamen on board saw four German airmen climbing out into a rubber dinghy with the bomber sinking soon after. The pilot, Lieutenant Kaumeyr, and his three crewmen were picked out of their dinghy by Ledbury.Irving, p. 105 The attack however, continued and throughout the fierce fighting the escorts distinguished themselves by screening the merchantmen from many attacks, especially U-boat sorties; Ledbury alone had sighted seven. The Admiralty believed that the convoy faced an imminent attack from elements of the German Kriegsmarine, possibly a combined attack of the commerce raiding capital ships , , and the . A series of signals were issued to the convoy, culminating in an order to 'scatter' to Soviet ports. In order to protect the convoy the destroyers and cruisers, believing that they were steaming to intercept a larger force, headed west thereby abandoning the merchantmen. Broome led his six destroyers round at twenty knots, and headed off in line ahead to join a number of cruisers and destroyers racing off to the south-west into a wall of fog. By 11:00, his destroyers were drawing very close to the cruisers. The destroyer signalled Ledbury, 'How fast are you going?' Ledbury replied, 'Full ahead.'Notes by Lieutenant Commander Higgens (Wilton), 4 July. However the threat posed by the capital ships failed to materialise and the scattered merchant ships came under U-boat and Luftwaffe attack, resulting in the sinking of twenty three ships. As well as the loss of precious lives and supplies, there was widespread bitterness and the recriminations reverberated for many months, as stated by the commander of Ledbury, Roger P. Hill: Pedestal and Ledbury =Background and preliminary movements= In 1942, Great Britain was waging war against Italian forces in North Africa and their allies, Rommel's Afrika Korps. Malta was critical to this campaign 'The Mediterranean campaign revolved around the island of Malta, where the British based surface ships, submarines and aircraft to attack the supplies for Italian and German armies in North Africa. Major convoy operations were mounted to sustain Malta and the island narrowly survived.' During this stage of the war, Malta was critically short on munitions, food and aviation fuel. Attempts to run the blockade and resupply Malta proved to be a failure; previous convoys such as Harpoon (from Gibraltar) and Vigorous (from Alexandria, Egypt) had lost most of their merchantmen and their escorts had been damaged.Bradford, p. 187 A new convoy was hence planned for mid- August, and named Pedestal. On 9 August 1942, Ledbury sailed from Gibraltar, sighted the convoy in the afternoon, and took its convoy screening station. An hour before midnight on 10 August she left the convoy and proceeded to refuel from the tanker Dingledale, an operation that took place early in the morning of 11 August. Ledbury took aboard 101 tons of fuel. Just before ten o'clock in the morning, the destroyer took station as starboard wing ship of screen. In the afternoon, was hit by torpedoes, with Derwent ordering Ledbury to stand by the stricken aircraft carrier. As Eagle sank, one destroyer and the tug Jaunty stopped, picking up survivors in the oil patches in the water. As Ledbury reached survivors, she was ordered to rejoin the convoy. The convoy now suffered a series of aerial attacks with the gunner of Ledburys port Oerlikon thought to have shot down one plane, although many other ships were firing at this machine. At 21:00, Ledbury was ordered to Anti-Aircraft station, with one cable on the starboard beam of No. 43. Early on the morning of 12 August, the destroyer was ordered by to investigate a periscope reported on the starboard quarter of No.43. Nelson reported a submarine periscope bearing north of her, and Ledbury deployed single scare charges to cover from this submarine, and destroyers astern of her appeared to follow up this contact. At nine o'clock in the morning, an air attack by Junkers 88s developed on the convoy, with one Junkers 88 crashing at bearing 058 degrees. Four small bombs were seen to go by the bridge, landing on the starboard side, and a large bomb came near the port quarter.Eldworth, pp. 75‚Äì76 In the ensuing mayhem, Ledbury was ordered to fill in gaps in the screen caused by ships falling back on contact. On the way to this position three airmen were seen coming down by parachute. One was picked up and found to be German, the others were abandoned. The captured airman stated that the last raid consisted of Luftwaffe airmen flying Junkers 88s from Sicily; and that he had been shot down by close range weapons from the convoy. Ledburys crew noted that the most interesting thing about the pilot was that the nails of his boots were made of wood. Yet another aerial attack ensued, this time by dive-bombers. Two groups approached from ahead, but neither got over the convoy. Two of these planes were shot down by gunfire. After this attack, the destroyer resumed station on the starboard side of the convoy. An attack by Junkers 88s soon started whilst escort fighters were still refuelling. Ledbury suffered another near miss off her port quarter. One ship in the convoy was damaged, and stood by her. Survivors from merchant ships disembark from HMS Ledbury at Malta The convoy now continued on its route, harassed and attacked at each step of its journey; it soon encountered submarines. One was forced to surface astern and it was sunk by a destroyer.Shankland and Hunter p. 117‚Äì118 A Junkers 87 dropped parachute mines, all of which fell clear. Twelve torpedo bombers approached from the starboard side but these were turned away by gunfire. At the same time, Junkers 87s carried out dive-bombing attacks, and HMS Indomitable was hit. At 19:00, Force \\"Z\\", (the battleships, the aircraft carriers, and three cruisers), retired from the convoy. Fifty minutesEldworth, pp. 78‚Äì80 after Force Z turned back, the convoy was in the process of forming two lines with the three T.S.D.S.TSDS gear (two speed destroyer sweep) consisted of paravanes attached to steel cables which were streamed out aft on either side of the stern destroyers ahead, and the remaining ships in their Anti-Aircraft stations in the column of the convoy. A signal, \\"Form two columns\\" was still flying, but most ships were anticipating the movement and moving to their new positions. Four minutes before 20:00, and and the tanker were torpedoed. The convoy carried out an emergency turn to starboard, and most destroyers turned back to stand by the damaged cruisers. Ledbury was in station on the starboard side of the convoy \\\\- about half way up two columns roughly formed with , and ahead. A cruiser reported aircraft detected by R.D.F on the port bow of the convoy and Ledbury was taken through the convoy to get to the engaged side; but a heavy and sustained attack by Junkers 88s dive bombing developed when the destroyer was still in between the two columns. The attack became increasingly indefensible; two ships were hit, one exploded, the other remained afloat but both were creating a huge mass of burning petrol on the water. Torpedo planes were now sighted on the starboard bow very close, but the light was failing quickly. Ledbury engaged the torpedo planes, but one delivered a very good attack, dropping two torpedoes. Another ship exploded, and Captain Hill assumed that was torpedoed at this time. Ledbury called Manchester to make sure that she was standing by the damaged ships; the destroyer sighted six ships out in the darkness steaming on various courses, mostly in a north or north-western direction. The destroyer called up the nearest ship and ordered course 120. This ship was . The orders were repeated to the nearest merchantmen. Ledbury then returned to Ohio intending to take her in tow, but the tanker reported that she could steam with her steering aft but had no compass. The destroyer switched on a brighter stern light and told the tanker to follow her to Malta. Ledbury informed stragglers of the presence of a minefield near Zembra, while she also contacted that the survivors from the damaged ships had not been picked up and that she was going on with the tanker. It seemed to the crew that a very long time had passed before the ships were clear of the glare of the burning ships. During the night, Ledbury sighted four E-Boat wrecks just around the next corner (These were sighted at 02:04, 03:32, 03:45 and 04:31 respectively). The destroyer Ledbury alongside the damaged tanker Ohio =Rescue operations= On 13 August, after sighting a small patrol boat, three abandoned merchant ships were passed, some of them close by with boats showing flares. The convoy was sighted early in the morning, with the destroyer leading the tanker in astern of the line. The destroyer then informed the Convoy Commander of the tanker's condition. Torpedo planes flew in to distract attention from Junkers 88s which were coming in from a height. The convoy had detected these by R.D.F but could not sight them and the escorts were slow in opening fire on them. was hit, probably by about three or four bombs, and blew up with a tremendous explosion leaving \\"a great pylon of flame on the sea\\". Ashanti signalled Ledbury to pick up survivors. The destroyer went to the scene, but it was originally thought impossible that anyone could survive such a terrific explosion and mass of flames, but on approaching, men were seen in the water. The destroyer entered the inferno, and after manoeuvring around the debris field the destroyer picked up forty-four survivors,Shankland and Hunter p. 153 and one body was buried that evening with military honours. Some time later it was discovered that Ledbury had on board survivors from both Waimarama and Melbourne Star. This happened because when Waimarama blew up it happened so suddenly that Melbourne Star passed right through the flames. Those aft on board Melbourne Star thought that their own ship had gone up and had jumped over the side.Shankland and Hunter p. 152‚Äì153 By half past-nine Ledbury had completed the recovery of survivors. By this time the Commander estimated that the destroyer was about thirty miles astern of the convoy, which meant that they had to speed up in order to reach the ships. Captain Hill then sent a message to Admiral Burrough, 'Interrogative STOP rejoin or go home'. When the signal rating brought in Burrough's reply it became apparent that the signal groups had been received corruptly, since the admiral was apparently ordering Ledbury to \\"proceed to the Orkney and Shetland Islands\\".Shankland and Hunter p. 163 After considering the signal, Captain Hill assumed that it plainly intended the destroyer to return to Gibraltar, however that he might be forgiven for not interpreting it correctly, and so Ledbury ignored the signal and set course for Ohio. Ledbury found Ohio with Penn standing by Dorset and Bramham dropping depth charges. The remnants of the convoy were about ten miles away, under attack from the air. Just as Captain Hill suggested to Penn to take Ohio in tow, Ledbury received a signal from the Convoy Commander to stand by Manchester in the Gulf of Hammamet. In view of the delay in signals, and as Penn and Bramham were standing by these two ships, Ledbury proceeded at to look for Manchester,Shankland and Hunter p. 165 which according to the signal given by S.O. Cruiser Force had a flooded engine room and was ablaze. As the destroyer searched for the missing ship, it had passed alongside the wreckage of Almeria Lykes, and it had also shot down two three-engined Savoia-Marchetti bombers. After making landfall and identifying a headland as Ras-Mahmur, course was set to follow the coastline looking for Manchester. When the destroyer was almost certain that Manchester was not in the bay, the coast was closed in case there might be any survivors on the beach. At this moment, the signal station at Neboel started calling up \\"VHM - VHA\\" but Ledbury did not reply. The signal station at Hammamet made a flag signal,Shankland and Hunter p. 171 \\"show your signal letters\\". The destroyer hoisted an Italian group consisting of flag \\" I \\" and three other flags tied in knots so as to be unreadable. This apparently satisfied the shore station as they hoisted a large French ensign. During this period Ledbury was showing no ensign and no Italian ensign was carried on board. The destroyer carried on down the coast until it was twelve miles (19 km) south of Hammamet. During this time there were enemy reports of a cruiser near Zembra and also that two destroyers were making for Pantelleria.The destroyer changed course to pass five miles south of Linosa, and she altered the course after dark in order to rejoin Ohio. =Ledbury and the Ohio= The damaged tanker, supported by Royal Navy destroyers By 14 August Ohio was stopped with no hope of getting her engines going as she had been hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury approached the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.Shankland and Hunter p. 181 A six-inch manilla rope was passed from the tanker's stern to the destroyer's midship oiling bollard, the idea being to take the stern to port, whilst the minesweeper towed her; but Ledbury put on too much weight and the minesweeper's tow parted. Penn then asked Ledbury to take the tanker in tow from ahead, which was done, using the tanker's tow and a shackle of Ledburys towing hawser-cable. Rye took the destroyer in towEldworth, Chapter XII to keep the ship from falling off, whilst Penn went alongside the starboard side of the tanker to act as a drag to keep her straight. Ledburys gunner, who was in charge of the towing party on board the tanker tried out all the tanker's guns, which proved valuable as at 10:44 the flotilla was attacked by nine Stukas. Just before the attack, American survivors from the merchantman Santa Elisa asked Commander Hill to take a party aboard Ohio to repair and man one of the anti-aircraft guns, an offer gratefully accepted by Ledburys captain.Shankland and Hunter p. 185 In the attack, Ledbury received a near miss within a few feet of the fo'c'sle, which fortunately was an oil bomb and caused no casualties. There was also a near miss astern. Help was however on the way, since Malta based Spitfires covered the ships and broke many enemy formations. This was the last successful attack, and Ledbury, Penn and Bramham secured either side of the tanker, and by some very skilful seamanship and endurance on the part of the crewsBradford pp. 216‚Äì217 brought Ohio into Valletta Harbour. Further action The action of Ledbury during Operation Pedestal was the pinnacle of an otherwise uneventful career. After Operation Pedestal Ledbury was involved in several other convoys throughout the latter stages of the Second World War. On 17 January 1943 Convoy JW 52 set sail with fifteen ships of Loch Ewe, with a Western close escort made up of the destroyers Ledbury, Middleton and Blankney, between 17 January and 21 January. Ledbury and the other destroyers left the convoy with the arrival of the Eastern escort, made up of the destroyers Onslaught, Beagle, Bulldog, Matchless, Musketeer, Offa and the Polish Piorun. In June 1943 Ledbury proceeded again to the Mediterranean after further service on escort duties between Iceland and the Orkney Islands and took part in the invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. During this operation, Ledbury formed part of Support Force East, in support of the troops of Forces N, B and V that formed XXX Corps. Ledbury was one of a group of upwards of fifty destroyers stationed to escort the landings' main force of cruisers. She was also involved in the Salerno invasion in September 1943, but thereafter her main employment was as a convoy escort to the Italian front, based at first on Malta and latterly at Alexandria. Occasional offensive patrols in the Adriatic and Aegean were undertaken. Between 15 January and 12 February 1944 Ledbury was engaged in patrols along the supply lines of the Dalmatian coast, where heavy Axis losses were involved, becoming untenable due to the increased employment of Allied fighter-bombers from bases in Italy. Between 15 January and 16 January, the destroyers Ledbury and Blackmore bombarded Durazzo while other elements on the same patrol, were approaching Curzola. After taking a minor covering role in the return of British troops to Athens in October 1944, Ledbury was reduced to reserve in March 1946, and was not again commissioned for active service, remaining in peacetime commission longer than most of her class, before being sold for scrap in 1958. The destroyer was broken up at Rosyth in April 1958.

Jobs can then be banded into grades, and the grades used to determine pay. PFA is a type of job evaluation; the main advantage of PFA is that it is systemic and analytical. Jobs are broken down into factors such as ‚Äúknowledge required‚Äù. A set of closed questions in each factor break down to detail such as ‚Äúlevel of education‚Äù. The responses to these questions are given a score, and totaled for each factor. Each factor is given a weight, and this affects the contribution made to the overall total score by that factor. Factors can be weighted according to their significance to the organization, and this allows the pay scheme to be linked to the organization‚Äôs strategy. A critical factor in job evaluation is that it is the role that is assessed, not the person doing it. Job evaluation can be performed on roles not recruited for yet. This means that the score should be both unrelated to the person doing the job and perceived as fair. PFA is not the only mechanism to do this analysis, as there are systems that carry out more complex calculations on the results of the questionnaire. The Hay System of Compensation is one of the most commonly-used systems; it compiles scores using a complex lookup chart to weigh the factor values. Many modern schemes attempt to take better account of this. When the evaluation is performed methodically and analytically, it can provide a material factor defense in equal pay claims. A criticism often made against PFA in isolation is that it fails to take account of external factors. Skills in high demand in the market can create a premium, as organizations have to compete for the people who have them. Some account of the skills required can be accounted for in the evaluation, but the relative number of people with those skills cannot be accounted for internally, and will change over time.

NOAA image. Holly Gilbert, NASA GSFC solar scientist, explains a model of magnetic fields on the sun. A stellar magnetic field is a magnetic field generated by the motion of conductive plasma inside a star. This motion is created through convection, which is a form of energy transport involving the physical movement of material. A localized magnetic field exerts a force on the plasma, effectively increasing the pressure without a comparable gain in density. As a result, the magnetized region rises relative to the remainder of the plasma, until it reaches the star's photosphere. This creates starspots on the surface, and the related phenomenon of coronal loops. Measurement The lower spectrum demonstrates the Zeeman effect after a magnetic field is applied to the source at top. The magnetic field of a star can be measured by means of the Zeeman effect. Normally the atoms in a star's atmosphere will absorb certain frequencies of energy in the electromagnetic spectrum, producing characteristic dark absorption lines in the spectrum. When the atoms are within a magnetic field, however, these lines become split into multiple, closely spaced lines. The energy also becomes polarized with an orientation that depends on orientation of the magnetic field. Thus the strength and direction of the star's magnetic field can be determined by examination of the Zeeman effect lines. A stellar spectropolarimeter is used to measure the magnetic field of a star. This instrument consists of a spectrograph combined with a polarimeter. The first instrument to be dedicated to the study of stellar magnetic fields was NARVAL, which was mounted on the Bernard Lyot Telescope at the Pic du Midi de Bigorre in the French Pyrenees mountains. Various measurements‚Äîincluding magnetometer measurements over the last 150 years; 14C in tree rings; and 10Be in ice cores‚Äîhave established substantial magnetic variability of the Sun on decadal, centennial and millennial time scales. Field generation Stellar magnetic fields, according to solar dynamo theory, are caused within the convective zone of the star. The convective circulation of the conducting plasma functions like a dynamo. This activity destroys the star's primordial magnetic field, then generates a dipolar magnetic field. As the star undergoes differential rotation‚Äîrotating at different rates for various latitudes‚Äîthe magnetism is wound into a toroidal field of \\"flux ropes\\" that become wrapped around the star. The fields can become highly concentrated, producing activity when they emerge on the surface. The magnetic field of a rotating body of conductive gas or liquid develops self-amplifying electric currents, and thus a self-generated magnetic field, due to a combination of differential rotation (different angular velocity of different parts of body), Coriolis forces and induction. The distribution of currents can be quite complicated, with numerous open and closed loops, and thus the magnetic field of these currents in their immediate vicinity is also quite twisted. At large distances, however, the magnetic fields of currents flowing in opposite directions cancel out and only a net dipole field survives, slowly diminishing with distance. Because the major currents flow in the direction of conductive mass motion (equatorial currents), the major component of the generated magnetic field is the dipole field of the equatorial current loop, thus producing magnetic poles near the geographic poles of a rotating body. The magnetic fields of all celestial bodies are often aligned with the direction of rotation, with notable exceptions such as certain pulsars. =Periodic field reversal= Another feature of this dynamo model is that the currents are AC rather than DC. Their direction, and thus the direction of the magnetic field they generate, alternates more or less periodically, changing amplitude and reversing direction, although still more or less aligned with the axis of rotation. The Sun's major component of magnetic field reverses direction every 11 years (so the period is about 22 years), resulting in a diminished magnitude of magnetic field near reversal time. During this dormancy, the sunspots activity is at maximum (because of the lack of magnetic braking on plasma) and, as a result, massive ejection of high energy plasma into the solar corona and interplanetary space takes place. Collisions of neighboring sunspots with oppositely directed magnetic fields result in the generation of strong electric fields near rapidly disappearing magnetic field regions. This electric field accelerates electrons and protons to high energies (kiloelectronvolts) which results in jets of extremely hot plasma leaving the Sun's surface and heating coronal plasma to high temperatures (millions of kelvin). If the gas or liquid is very viscous (resulting in turbulent differential motion), the reversal of the magnetic field may not be very periodic. This is the case with the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent currents in a viscous outer core. Surface activity Starspots are regions of intense magnetic activity on the surface of a star. (On the Sun they are termed sunspots.) These form a visible component of magnetic flux tubes that are formed within a star's convection zone. Due to the differential rotation of the star, the tube becomes curled up and stretched, inhibiting convection and producing zones of lower than normal temperature. Coronal loops often form above starspots, forming from magnetic field lines that stretch out into the stellar corona. These in turn serve to heat the corona to temperatures over a million kelvins. The magnetic fields linked to starspots and coronal loops are linked to flare activity, and the associated coronal mass ejection. The plasma is heated to tens of millions of kelvins, and the particles are accelerated away from the star's surface at extreme velocities. Surface activity appears to be related to the age and rotation rate of main- sequence stars. Young stars with a rapid rate of rotation exhibit strong activity. By contrast middle-aged, Sun-like stars with a slow rate of rotation show low levels of activity that varies in cycles. Some older stars display almost no activity, which may mean they have entered a lull that is comparable to the Sun's Maunder minimum. Measurements of the time variation in stellar activity can be useful for determining the differential rotation rates of a star. 600px Magnetosphere A star with a magnetic field will generate a magnetosphere that extends outward into the surrounding space. Field lines from this field originate at one magnetic pole on the star then end at the other pole, forming a closed loop. The magnetosphere contains charged particles that are trapped from the stellar wind, which then move along these field lines. As the star rotates, the magnetosphere rotates with it, dragging along the charged particles. As stars emit matter with a stellar wind from the photosphere, the magnetosphere creates a torque on the ejected matter. This results in a transfer of angular momentum from the star to the surrounding space, causing a slowing of the stellar rotation rate. Rapidly rotating stars have a higher mass loss rate, resulting in a faster loss of momentum. As the rotation rate slows, so too does the angular deceleration. By this means, a star will gradually approach, but never quite reach, the state of zero rotation. Magnetic stars SU Aur (a young star of T Tauri type), reconstructed by means of Zeeman-Doppler imaging A T Tauri star is a type of pre‚Äìmain sequence star that is being heated through gravitational contraction and has not yet begun to burn hydrogen at its core. They are variable stars that are magnetically active. The magnetic field of these stars is thought to interact with its strong stellar wind, transferring angular momentum to the surrounding protoplanetary disk. This allows the star to brake its rotation rate as it collapses. Small, M-class stars (with 0.1‚Äì0.6 solar masses) that exhibit rapid, irregular variability are known as flare stars. These fluctuations are hypothesized to be caused by flares, although the activity is much stronger relative to the size of the star. The flares on this class of stars can extend up to 20% of the circumference, and radiate much of their energy in the blue and ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. Straddling the boundary between stars that undergo nuclear fusion in their cores and non- hydrogen fusing brown dwarfs are the ultracool dwarfs. These objects can emit radio waves due to their strong magnetic fields. Approximately 5-10% of these objects have had their magnetic fields measured. The coolest of these, 2MASS J10475385+2124234 with a temperature of 800-900 K, retains a magnetic field stronger than 1.7 kG, making it some 3000 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field. Radio observations also suggest that their magnetic fields periodically change their orientation, similar to the Sun during the solar cycle. Planetary nebulae are created when a red giant star ejects its outer envelope, forming an expanding shell of gas. However it remains a mystery why these shells are not always spherically symmetrical. 80% of planetary nebulae do not have a spherical shape; instead forming bipolar or elliptical nebulae. One hypothesis for the formation of a non-spherical shape is the effect of the star's magnetic field. Instead of expanding evenly in all directions, the ejected plasma tends to leave by way of the magnetic poles. Observations of the central stars in at least four planetary nebulae have confirmed that they do indeed possess powerful magnetic fields. After some massive stars have ceased thermonuclear fusion, a portion of their mass collapses into a compact body of neutrons called a neutron star. These bodies retain a significant magnetic field from the original star, but the collapse in size causes the strength of this field to increase dramatically. The rapid rotation of these collapsed neutron stars results in a pulsar, which emits a narrow beam of energy that can periodically point toward an observer. Compact and fast- rotating astronomical objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) have extremely strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field of a newly born fast-spinning neutron star is so strong (up to 108 teslas) that it electromagnetically radiates enough energy to quickly (in a matter of few million years) damp down the star rotation by 100 to 1000 times. Matter falling on a neutron star also has to follow the magnetic field lines, resulting in two hot spots on the surface where it can reach and collide with the star's surface. These spots are literally a few feet (about a metre) across but tremendously bright. Their periodic eclipsing during star rotation is hypothesized to be the source of pulsating radiation (see pulsars). An extreme form of a magnetized neutron star is the magnetar. These are formed as the result of a core-collapse supernova. The existence of such stars was confirmed in 1998 with the measurement of the star SGR 1806-20. The magnetic field of this star has increased the surface temperature to 18 million K and it releases enormous amounts of energy in gamma ray bursts. Jets of relativistic plasma are often observed along the direction of the magnetic poles of active black holes in the centers of very young galaxies. Star- Planet Interaction Controversy In 2008, a team of astronomers first described how as the exoplanet orbiting HD 189733 A reaches a certain place in its orbit, it causes increased stellar flaring. In 2010, a different team found that every time they observe the exoplanet at a certain position in its orbit, they also detected X-ray flares. Theoretical research since 2000 suggested that an exoplanet very near to the star that it orbits may cause increased flaring due to the interaction of their magnetic fields, or because of tidal forces. In 2019, astronomers combined data from Arecibo Observatory, MOST, and the Automated Photoelectric Telescope, in addition to historical observations of the star at radio, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths to examine these claims. Their analysis found that the previous claims were exaggerated and the host star failed to display many of the brightness and spectral characteristics associated with stellar flaring and solar active regions, including sunspots. They also found that the claims did not stand up to statistical analysis, given that many stellar flares are seen regardless of the position of the exoplanet, therefore debunking the earlier claims. The magnetic fields of the host star and exoplanet do not interact, and this system is no longer believed to have a \\"star-planet interaction.\\" See also * Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable * Dynamo theory * Earth's magnetic field * Fossil stellar magnetic field * Intermediate polar * Magnetic field * Peculiar star * Polar (cataclysmic variable) * SX Arietis variable References External links * * Magnetic field Category:Magnetism Magnetic field ","title":"Stellar magnetic field"},{"id":"11887289","text":"Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa (born 1944) was the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, a state in northeast India, serving since August 2016.

It was there on the streets of the city that the young Salih started playing local Sha‚Äôabiya football before he joined the Mosul juniors or Nasha‚Äôeen in 1994 under coach Khalid Ahmed and later with the youth team in 1997 with coaches Mekki and Nadhim Fadhil. Three years later in season 2000-2001 at the age of 17, Salih was promoted to the first team of Mosul with coach Mohammed Jassim and his assistant Mohammed Fathi and managed to score seven goals for the team in the Iraqi second division. The move proved to be a success for Salih as he scored 12 goals in 10 matches to be named the top scorer in the Syrian second division. Salih‚Äôs goals helped the club to fourth place in the northern group of the second division with 23 points, however they were 15 points behind leaders Fetowa. His goals did eventually lead him to the Syrian first division or the ‚ÄúMumtaz‚Äù league however with another club, as he moved to Umayya Idlib with his team-mate Silwan Mohammed. However his time at the club was short and after only 10 appearances and three goals in the top division in Syria, a Romanian agent of Syrian descent called Dr. Aksam Kadour offered him a chance to play in Europe through his connections in his adoptive country, and Salih without thinking twice took it. In early 2004 he moved to Romanian second division club FC Gloria BuzƒÉu for a transfer fee of $140,000 dollars and a monthly wage of $5,300 dollars. At the time of the Iraqi player‚Äôs arrival to Romania, the hostage situation involving Romanian Journalists Marie Jeanne Ion, Ovidiu Ohanesian and Sorin Miscoci who were seized in the Iraqi capital on March 28, 2005 along with their translator Mohd Munaf were making headlines in the Romanian press. Their captives declared they would be killed if Romanian troops had not left Iraq in four days. They were eventually released unharmed in May 2005. Salih having only just made his debut on April 16, told Pro Sport newspaper ‚ÄúIf I were sure that the Romanian journalists would be released, I would offer myself in exchange.‚Äù, and added ‚ÄúMy people are quiet and my countrymen don‚Äôt do these kind of things.‚Äù After scoring six goals in only eight games for Gloria BuzƒÉu including a hat-trick in a 5-1 win over CS Politehnica Timi≈üoara, Salih was interesting several top clubs and in the end joined Universitatea Craiova, a team that had just been relegated from the Romanian first division Divizie A.

Early life Marshall was born in St Ives, Cornwall, the youngest of four children. His father was a chief steward for the Great Western Railway and his mother was institutionalised from illness when he was two years old. From then on, he was raised by his grandmother and her second husband in nearby Halsetown. His cousin Kenneth Quick was also a potter, and his grandfather was a silversmith. At the age of seven, he developed a tuberculosis illness in his legs, and he became exceptionally thin and missed large amounts of schooling. He became the first local apprentice at St Ives' Leach Pottery at the age of 14, picked by Bernard Leach's son David due to his enthusiasm and despite his physical weakness. Career While he was initially registered as an \\"essential worker\\", Marshall was conscripted for World War II in 1942 and joined the Royal Artillery. He landed on Juno Beach during the Normandy Landings and supported Canadian troops. He was then stationed in Elbe in Germany, and finally returned to St Ives in 1947 following an almost fatal period of illness. Back at the Leach Pottery, he began to throw larger and more complex pots, becoming its foreman. Marshall began developing his own style of pottery, inspired by his interpretation: unlike his mentor Leach, he never visited the country and instead learned about potters like Kitaoji Rosanjin from conversations and stories. He made friends with Shoji Hamada, and both their influence can be seen in the abstract style of his decoration. By the 1960s, Marshall's strong and simple style had been firmly established: he used his oriental, English and North American influences to evoke the spirit of the Cornish coastal landscape. He left the Leach Pottery in 1977 to start his own workshop in Lelant, and taught a college in Redruth until the mid-1980s. Marshall exhibited across the world, showing at the Penwith Society of Arts, Rotterdam's Boymans Museum, and various Arts Council travelling shows. His work would later be acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the University of Warwick. Personal life He married his wife Marjorie in 1951, and they had a daughter and a son, Andrew. He became a potter and assisted his father at his Lelant pottery.

He had 33 receptions for 370 yards with three touchdowns in his first year. His best season came in 2006, when he moved to the expansion Utah Blaze, becoming one of its inaugural players. For that year, he had 52 receptions for 665 yards and 13 touchdowns. Named the team's Iron Man of the Year, he also had 34 tackles, (eight solo), and three forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery. Skaggs did well in 2007, with four receiving and four rushing touchdowns, as well as 22 tackles. Personal life and death Skaggs was married with two children. In late May 2007, after having headaches, Skaggs visited a doctor for what he thought was a neck injury. MRIs and CAT scans located several tumors in the left lobe of his brain, and doctors diagnosed him with stage III oligodendroglioma, an inoperable brain cancer, on June 1. In spite of the diagnosis, he showed up for a game three days later against the Colorado Crush.

Early life Shirazi was born in Kabud Gonbad Rural District, Iran, on 13 June 1944. His father being a non-commissioned officer in the Army motivated him to join and in 1964 he joined as a cadet. Career Shirazi was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Artillery and in 1974, he was sent to the United States for further military education. When he returned to Iran he showed opposition to the policies of the Pahlavi government and participated in some street demonstrations. He then joined the opposition movement against the Shah. During the 1979 revolution, he served in the 64th Infantry Division in Urumiyeh. He was later awarded the rank of lieutenant general of the Iranian armed forces. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War Sayad Shirazi became one of the most important generals of Iran. In 1981, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appointed him commander of the Ground Forces of the Iranian Army. In 1982, he led the Iranian Pasdaran and Basij soldiers to victory in the Iranian Operation Undeniable Victory, this was the first time Iran was able to defeat Iraq in a major battle, Iran broke through Iraq's \\"impenetrable\\" defense lines and expelled them from the Dezful-Shush area, this operation is considered by many as the turning point in the war. During Iran's attempt to capture Basra with Operation Ramadan Shirazi was said: We will continue the war until Saddam Hussein is overthrown so that we can pray at Karbala and Jerusalem. In 1986, he was named member of the Supreme Defense Council. However, three weeks after this appointment Shirazi was relieved of his post as commander of the ground forces. In 1988, the People's Mujahedin of Iran with help of Saddam Hussein invaded West-Iran and battled Iranian forces for Kermanshah. Iran's counter offensive, Operation Mersad (led by Shirazi), defeated MEK forces. He also led other successful military operations against Iraq, such as, Operation Zafar 7; and Operation Nasr-4. In 1989, Shirazi was awarded the highest military distinction in the Iranian armed forces, the Fath (Conquest) medal. When the war concluded, Shirazi was not promoted to major general (unlike his counterparts), but was instead given various staff assignments. =Controversy= Ali Sayad Shirazi and Mohsen Rezaee A clash and disagreement over strategy to be adopted in the Iran-Iraq war emerged between Shirazi and Mohsen Rezaee, commander of the Revolutionary Guards, in July 1986. When this rivalry became public, Ayatollah Khomeini met them in his residence on 19 July 1986 and urged them to \\"seek unity\\", telling them \\"You must endeavor, not to think in terms of being members of the Armed Forces or those of the Guards Corps or of the Basij forces. ... We must understand that if there were to be any disputes among you ... not only are we doomed here and now, but we also are guilty before God.\\" It remains unclear why, Mohsen Rezaee, who had little military experience was in a technical dispute with a senior general. Ali Sayyad Shirazi (with Mohsen Rezai, and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani) was seen as among \\"the most hawkish of Iran‚Äôs military and civilian leaders, and those who most clearly advocated for continuing the war into Iraq.\\" Assassination On 10 April 1999, 6:45 local time, Shirazi was assassinated outside his house while on his way to work. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message on Shirazi's martyrdom. Iranian ex-President Khatami described him as \\"a selfless commander of Islam and honorable son of Iran.\\" A Mujahedeen Khalq spokesman said that Shirazi had been targeted because for \\"purging and executing military personnel and for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of teen-agers in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980's, in which he commanded Iran's ground forces.\\" Legacy Funeral of General Ali Sayad Shirazi Thousands of people attended his state funeral. Shirazi has had several streets, buildings and military complexes named after him, including a subway station and a highway in Tehran.

The office is known for analyzing the state budget with the aim of making government programs more effective and less costly. The LAO was the first such institution in the United States that was designed to help both houses of a legislature manage the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion; it inspired the creation of many similar agencies in other states, as well as the creation of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in 1974. The LAO should not be confused with the California Legislative Counsel (a position established in 1913) which does not focus primarily on the budget. The LAO is overseen by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC), a 16-member bipartisan committee. The office has a staff of 43 analysts and approximately 13 support staff. The analytical staff is divided into four subject areas: Corrections, Environment, and Transportation; State and Local Finance; Education; and Health and Human Services. The Office was founded when the JLBC appointed the first \\"Legislative Auditor\\" on October 8, 1941 to assist with the state budgeting process. Because it was frequently confused with the state auditor, the title was changed to \\"Legislative Analyst\\" in 1957. The office has had five Legislative Analysts since its creation. Rolland Vandegrift served from 1941 to 1949, A. Alan Post served from 1949 to 1977, William Hamm served from 1977 to 1986, Elizabeth Hill served from 1986 to 2008, Mac Taylor served from 2008-2018, and currently Gabriel Petek serves as legislative analyst. One of the most important responsibilities of the LAO has been to analyze the annual Governor's budget and publish a detailed review at the end of February. The office has presented a series of analyses from the beginning to the end of the budget process on overarching fiscal issues and specific departmental budget proposals and offered its recommendations for legislative action. In order to provide the Legislature with timely advice on these matters, the LAO has published its budget comments and advice in the form of separate written reports, handouts for hearings, and entries on a Web-based online list, all of which are available at its website. These documents help set the agenda for the work of the Legislature's fiscal committees in developing a state budget. Staff of the office work with these committees throughout the budget process and provide public testimony on the office's recommendations. More generally, the office is a staff resource to all legislators. The LAO also performs the following functions: *Budget \\"Control.\\" The LAO reviews requests by the administration to make changes to the budget after it is enacted. These reviews are used primarily by members of the JLBC and the fiscal committees. *Special Reports. Throughout the year, the office prepares special reports on the state budget and topics of interest to the Legislature. *Initiatives and Ballot Measures. The office estimates the fiscal effect on state and local government of all proposed initiatives (prior to circulation) and prepares analyses of all measures that qualify for the statewide ballot. *Forecasting. The LAO forecasts the state revenues and expenditures.

It orbits the star further out than Earth orbits the Sun. It has moderate eccentricity. The planet orbits one of the four giant stars in the Hyades cluster that is 2.7 times the mass of our Sun, making it the most massive planet-harboring star. This provides evidence that it was an A-type star when it was on the main-sequence. Name In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Amateru for this planet.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The name was based on that submitted by the Kamagari Astronomical Observatory of Kure, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan: namely 'Amaterasu', the Shinto goddess of the Sun, born from the left eye of the god Izanagi. The IAU substituted 'Amateru' - which is a common Japanese appellation for shrines when they enshrine Amaterasu - because 'Amaterasu' is already used for asteroid 10385 Amaterasu.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names  Characteristics  =Mass, radius and temperature= Epsilon Tauri b is a \\"super-Jupiter\\", an exoplanet that has a radius and mass larger than that of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. It has a temperature of . It has an estimated mass of around 7.6 and a potential radius of around 18% larger than Jupiter (1.18 , or 12 ) based on its mass, since it is more massive than the jovian planet. =Host star= The planet orbits a (K-type) giant star named Epsilon Tauri. It has exhausted the hydrogen supply in its core and is currently fusing helium. The star has a mass of 2.7 and a radius of around 12.6 . It has a surface temperature of 4901 K and is 625 million years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 3.53. Therefore, Epsilon Tauri can be seen with the naked eye. = Orbit = Epsilon Tauri b orbits its star with nearly 97 times the Sun's luminosity (97 ) every 645 days at a distance of 1.93 AU (compared to Mars' orbital distance from the Sun, which is 1.52 AU). It has a mildly eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.15.  Discovery  Epsilon Tauri b was discovered by using the High Dispersion Echelon Spectrograph at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO) as part of a process to study G-type and K-type giant stars to search for exoplanets. Measurements of radial velocity from Epsilon Tauri were taken between December 2003 and July 2006. Wobbles in the star were detected, and after analyzing the data, it was eventually concluded that there was a planetary companion with a mass 7 times that of Jupiter orbiting Epsilon Tauri every 645 days, or nearly 2 years with an eccentricity of 0.15.

Apperley Bridge is north-east of Bradford on the boundary with the City of Leeds bounded in the east by Carr Beck and to the south by Greengates. The village straddles the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the River Aire. It takes its name from the old bridge over the river on Apperley Lane. Parts of Rawdon in Leeds of similar character are included in the BD10 Apperley Bridge postal district.  History  The bridge from which the village takes its name was built in the late-16th century or early-17th century. In 1777 a stone arched bridge was built on Harrogate Road over the canal but the present bridge dates from 1936 and has since been widened. From 1846 until its closure in 1965, Apperley Bridge railway station was situated across the boundary in Rawdon. Off Tenterfields close to the canal were four 19th-century mills; Apperdale Mill (formerly Dyehouse Mill), Oaklea Mills, Valley Mills (Canal Mills) and Whitfield Mill. Apperdale Mill and Oaklea Mills survive close to the canal basin, which is now a pleasure boat marina. Since the 1990s housing has been built in the Tenterfields area between the canal up to Greengates. Valley Mills and Whitfield Mills were demolished to make way for the development, while Apperdale Mill and Oaklea Mill were converted into residential units. Apperley Bridge has a strong thriving local community group - Greengates and Apperley Brdige community volunteers - who organise weekly litter picking and community events/activities Hammonds sauce factory on Harrogate Road close to the canal has been replaced by modern development. In the 2000s the village was considered for conservation area status but was turned down partly because many of its older buildings already had listed building status.  Governance  Apperley Bridge is in the Idle and Thackley ward of Bradford City Council.  Economy  On Apperley Lane is the head office of JCT600 vehicle hire and dealership.; Next to the Harrogate Road bridge over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal is Apperley Bridge Quarries. On the canal itself is Apperley Bridge Marina with a cafe, office, and chandler operated by Calder Valley Marine.

Landmarks  Historic Apperley Bridge village is a collection of buildings and groups of buildings separated by green space, it does not have a square, green, or commercial area that could be identified as a focal centre for the village. The old bridge from which Apperley Bridge takes its name is of ashlar construction with two arches and a partially obliterated inscription by the road edge. Numerous farm buildings, barns, and previously canal related buildings along Apperley Road near Milman Bridge have listed building status. The Dog and Gun, The George and Dragon,* and The Stansfield Arms* public houses are historic former houses, farmhouses and barns. The Woodhouse Grove Methodist Church (grade II listed) includes photograph and the Moody Cow on Harrogate Road in Rawdon are notable large buildings.

The gates are called by the original Spanish word for \\"gate\\", Puerta (plural: Puertas). Gates facing the west =Puerta de Banderas= This gate was built in 1662 as the Governor-General's gate when the first Governor's palace was still located in Fort Santiago. It was destroyed during an earthquake and was never rebuilt. =Puerta de Postigo= Postigo means \\"postern\\" or a small gate in Spanish. This gate was named after the nearby Palacio del Gobernador. The first postigo was built several meters away but was walled up in 1662 when the present gate was constructed. The gate was then renovated in 1782 under the direction of military engineer Tomas Sanz. The gate leads to the palaces of the Governor-General and Archbishop of Manila. The national hero of the Philippines Jose Rizal passed through this gate from Fort Santiago to his execution at Bagumbayan field on December 30, 1896. It was damaged during the Battle of Manila in 1945 and restored in 1968. The gate was excavated and restored from 1982-1983. =Puerta de Sta. Lucia= This is one of the original entrances to the Walled City when it was built in 1603. It underwent improvements in the late 18th century including the addition of two side chambers added during renovations done by Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas (1778-1787). A wooden marker commemorating the gate's new appearance was later installed over the entrance. Puerta de Sta. Lucia became favored as an entry point to Malecon Drive, a promenade area along the shore of Manila Bay. Puerta de Sta. Lucia was destroyed during the Battle of Manila in 1945 to allow the entry of American tanks into the city. The entire gate was demolished when road access to the city from the southern side was needed. The chambers were restored in 1968 and the gate was reconstructed in 1982. Gate facing the south Puerta Real =Puerta Real= The original Real Gate (Royal Gate) was built in 1663 at the end of Calle Real de Palacio (now General Luna Street) and was used exclusively by the Governor-General for state occasions. It was located west of Baluarte de San Andres and faced the old village of Bagumbayan. It was destroyed during the British invasion of 1762 along with the removal of the village. The Puerta Real was rebuilt in 1780 and moved further west to its present location as part of the new defense plan for Intramuros. During the Battle of Manila, the gate was damaged. It was restored in 1969 with additional work made in 1989. Gate facing the east Puerta de Parian =Puerta del Parian= The gate was named after the \\"Parian de Arroceros\\", one of the earliest concentrations of Chinese merchants located across the city where the Metropolitan Theater now stands. Built in 1593, it is one of the earliest entrances to Intramuros. It became the official entrance of the Governor-General in 1764, following the destruction of Puerta Real during the British invasion. It was here that the newly appointed Governor-General received the keys of the city from the Cabildo. The Parian gate was severely damaged by artillery shelling during the Battle of Manila. Restoration begun in 1967 and completed in 1982. Gates facing the north =Puerta de Almacenes= It was built in 1690 for trading with the other side of the river and continually renovated until its completion in 1739. The gate lasted until 1903 when American military engineers demolished the walls for widening the river wharves along Intramuros. =Puerta de Santo Domingo/Puerta de Aduana= This gate named after the nearby Santo Domingo Church, was built in the 18th century during the renovation of the riverside defenses. It opened to the river wharves, but the American engineers tore down the gate & fortification in 1903 to open a road to Intramuros from Magallanes Drive. Puerta Isabel II =Puerta de Isabel II= The last gate to be built in Intramuros was opened in 1861 as a solution to the heavy pedestrian traffic outside Parian Gate to the Puente de Espana (Bridge of Spain) and Binondo. Located in front of it is the Queen Isabel II statue honoring the then reigning Spanish monarch. The gate became part of the route of the tranv√≠a (streetcar) that started in 19th century Manila. It was damaged during the Battle of Manila in 1945 and restored in 1966.

The group, located in the Student Competition Center, allows students to engage in a wide range of engineering-related activities, and has members from almost every engineering major of study offered at Georgia Tech. Students work collaboratively in a group environment and have the abilities to pursue projects on their own. History RoboJackets was founded in 1999 by a group of grads and undergrads interested in the BattleBots competitions. The following year, they would start their highly respected FIRST outreach and mentoring program. The group's first home was in the J.S. Coon building. In 2003, due to renovations of the Coon building and the mechanical engineering department's move to new buildings, the RoboJackets were moved across the alley to the \\"Tin Building\\". After the move, the organization expanded to encompass a new IGVC team (started in 2003) and a RoboCup team (started in 2007). In 2011, the teams were relocated to the new Student Competition Center located on 14th Street, north of the Georgia Tech campus. In 2013, the RoboJackets IARRC team was created. Over the years, the team has grown from a handful of students to over 200 active members. Competition The RoboJackets participate in several robotics competitions, including RoboCup Small Size league, FIRST, BattleBots, the International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge, and the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. The organization also takes part in a few local non-robotics competitions such as the Dooley Derby and the Starlight Soapbox Downhill Challenge. Education Since 2001, the RoboJackets have run Technology Enrichment Sessions (TE Sessions) each fall to expose high school students to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The sessions, typically 10 weeks in length, focus on concepts and skills needed to participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition. The sessions culminate in a robotics challenge which allows the students to apply their newly found skills to a real robotic system. Typical attendance is over twenty schools. This year, two sessions, an advanced and beginner session, are planned. Independent Projects The RoboJackets also encourages its members to work on their own independent robotics projects. Some of these have included a hexapod, an inverse-kinematic arm, an automated version of the Georgia Tech \\"Rambling Wreck\\" mascot, and a Roomba-like vacuuming robot.

The crest of the dam is 625 metres long. It is 30.5 metres in height and drops the river surface 12 metres. Fanshawe Lake is the reservoir created by the dam. The hydroelectric generator of the Fanshawe Dam generates enough power to run 400 households. It is one of three dams on the Thames River and its tributaries. After repeated floods, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority built the dam to control the level of the Thames River; construction began in 1950 and completed in 1952. It cost $5 million - Federal government 37.5%, Provincial government 37.5%, Upper Thames River Conservation Authority 25% (95% from City of London, Ontario, 5% from London Township).

It was run by Thomas Henry \\"Harry\\" Armstrong and his wife Annie (n√©e Bowman). Harry fought in WWI, was a noted marksman and served at Vimy Ridge. They had two daughters Paula and Sheila. His great grandson, through Paula's son Jason and wife Linda (n√©e Langner), was in turn named Fletcher Harrison Smith, after the town and Harry. Fletcher Smith became a track and field thrower of note. At 17 he threw shot put, discus and javelin, having won National Legion Gold For shot put and National Bronze for javelin in 2015. If the clay was good enough and Harry felt there was demand he would make bricks and many of the surrounding towns, such as Tilbury, would have homes and city buildings made of his brick. Many of the family farms are now cropped by larger industrial-style farms. In the 2000s, members of the community have been debating the zoning of a landfill to be located within its borders.

Early life His father was Armand de Belsunce, Marquis de Castelmoron, and his mother Anne de Caumont de Lausun. He studied classics in Paris at the College de Clermont or Lycee Louis-le-Grand and then entered the Society of Jesus. In 1699 he left the Society to become Vicar-General of Agen. The Vie de Suzanne de Foix, a biography of his aunt, was written by him and published while at Agen, 1709. That same year he was made Bishop of Marseille. The plague The charity he displayed during the plague of 1720 and 1721 made his name a household word and won for him the title of \\"Good Bishop\\". When the plague broke out a large fleet was taking the Princess of Orl√©ans to Italy where she was to marry the Duke of Modena. The suite of the princess took to flight, and with them all the notables of the city, but Bishop Belsunce remained with a few friends, and together they battled against the plague, till they conquered it. In his address to the Assembly of the Clergy in 1725, Belsunce stated that more than 250 priests and religious perished at that time. But he was the soul of the rescuers and the praises bestowed on him by Alexander Pope and Charles Hubert Millevoye (Essay on Man and Belsunce ou la peste de Marseille) were deserved. The King of France offered him, by way of recognition, the See of Laon to which was attached the first ecclesiastical peerage of the realm and afterwards the metropolitan See of Bordeaux. Belsunce refused both and contented himself with accepting the pallium sent him by Pope Clement XII. He is mentioned by Albert Camus in the novel The Plague, in the second sermon of Father Paneloux. Jansenism During his incumbency Belsunce fought against Jansenism. He attended, 1727, the Synod of Embrun where Jean Soanen was condemned. He opposed with all his power Colbert of Pamiers. In spite of the protest of the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence, he instructed his priests to refuse absolution to the appellants against the Bull Unigenitus. Nearly all his pastoral instructions are against Jansenism. Works Besides the Vie de Suzanne de Foix (Agen, 1709), and his pastoral instructions, we have from his pen Le combat chr√©tien translated from Augustine of Hippo's De Agone Christiano and L'art de bien mourir translated from Bellarmine's De Arte Bene Moriendi, also Antiquit√©s de l'Eglise de Marseille (Marseilles, 1747‚Äì51). All these writings were published by Jauffret under the title of Oeuvres de Belsunce (Metz, 1822).

It runs in a general east‚Äìwest direction from LA 77 in Maringouin to the junction of LA 1 and LA 987-4 in Port Allen. The route initially heads south from Maringouin alongside the bayou of the same name before turning east through the village of Rosedale. This portion of LA 76 makes a loop off of LA 77 and connects the two communities to Interstate 10 (I-10) via LA 3000 at Ramah. East of Rosedale, LA 76 crosses from Iberville Parish into West Baton Rouge Parish and parallels I-10 into Port Allen, the parish seat. The east‚Äìwest portion of LA 76 is also signed as an Incident Alternate Route of I-10. LA 76 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, essentially replacing State Route 998 and State Route 142 west of Rosedale, as well as short portions of State Route 1, State Route 7, and State Route 30 between Rosedale and Port Allen. This latter stretch had served as part of the Jefferson Highway auto trail, as well as U.S. Highways 71 and 190 before the completion of the Huey P. Long Bridge across the Mississippi River in 1940. Route description From the west, LA 76 begins at a T-intersection with LA 77 in the small Iberville Parish town of Maringouin. It heads south, continuing the path of LA 77 alongside Bayou Maringouin. After , LA 3000 picks up the route and proceeds a short distance further to an interchange with I-10 at Ramah. Meanwhile, LA 76 turns northeast onto Rosedale Road and continues into the village of Rosedale. Here, the highway has a second junction with LA 77, which follows Bayou Grosse Tete through the area. LA 76 crosses a bascule bridge over the bayou and immediately intersects LA 411 on the opposite bank. Just northeast of Rosedale, the surroundings change abruptly from rural farmland to thickly wooded wetlands, and LA 76 crosses into West Baton Rouge Parish. About across the parish line, LA 76 intersects LA 413 (Poydras Bayou Drive), connecting with US 190 at Erwinville. Soon afterward, LA 76 curves due east, and the surroundings return to rural farmland. later, LA 76 intersects LA 1145 (Calumet Road) and then dips south slightly to a junction with LA 415 (Lobdell Highway), a four-lane thoroughfare. Rosedale Road continues straight ahead as part of LA 986 while LA 76 turns south to run concurrent with LA 415 for a short distance. LA 76 turns east again onto Court Street just north of an interchange with I-10 and returns to its original two-lane capacity. The highway then proceeds into the small city of Port Allen, which serves as the parish seat. Immediately after crossing the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) line at grade, LA 76 ends at a junction with LA 1 (Alexander Avenue), a divided four-lane highway with service roads. Court Street continues straight ahead toward the Mississippi River as part of LA 987-4. =Route classification and data= LA 76 has several different classifications by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) over the course of its route. It generally functions as a rural minor collector along the Bayou Maringouin road, a rural major collector along Rosedale Road, an urban principal arterial along Lobdell Highway, and an urban minor arterial along Court Street. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 24,100 vehicles on Lobdell Highway outside of Port Allen. The lowest numbers were reported south of Maringouin with an average between 790 and 970 vehicles per day. The posted speed limit is generally in rural areas, but is reduced as low as through town. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, LA 76 was part of several different routes, including State Route 998 along Bayou Maringouin; State Route 142 to Rosedale; State Route 1 and State Route 7 to Lobdell Highway; and State Route 30 into Port Allen. The section between Rosedale and Port Allen had formerly been part of one of the state's most important highways, the Jefferson Highway auto trail, which was the main traffic route between New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport in the days before the numbered U.S. Highway system. It became part of the original alignment of US 71 in 1926 and then US 190 in 1935 when the latter was extended west from Baton Rouge. This portion of what is now LA 76 connected to the Baton Rouge ferry across the Mississippi River before the completion of the Huey P. Long Bridge upstream on the current alignment of US 190 in 1940. This and other highway realignments in the area caused the Rosedale Road to decline in importance in the years leading up to the Louisiana Department of Highways' renumbering of the state highway system in 1955. LA 76 was created in the 1955 renumbering, bringing portions of several different former routes under a single designation. With the 1955 renumbering, the state highway department initially categorized all routes into three classes: \\"A\\" (primary), \\"B\\" (secondary), and \\"C\\" (farm-to-market). This system has since been updated and replaced by a more specific functional classification system. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the eastern portion of LA 76 along Court Street in the Port Allen area is proposed for deletion as it no longer meets a significant interurban travel function.

The Joseph Jefferson Awards Committee evolved in response to a search by Chicago actors for a way to honor local theatre talent. In 1968, the Midwest Advisory Committee of Actors' Equity appointed member Felix Shuman to find a means of gaining recognition for actors working in the city. Joined by actors Guy Barile, Aviva Crane and June Travis Friedlob, Shuman identified and recruited twenty-four individuals active in education, business and social affairs. These individuals originally met for a luncheon at the Ivanhoe Theatre and went on to become the Joseph Jefferson Awards Committee under the first Chairmanship of Henry G. Plitt. Among the original members were three theatre supporters who would be active Jeff members two decades later‚ÄîMorton Ries, Judith Sagan and Joseph Wolfson. The charter of the Jeff Committee today continues to honor excellence in the Chicago theatre community. The first annual Jeff Awards ceremony was held in the Guildhall of the Ambassador West Hotel on October 6, 1969. It was attended by 175 people. Six awards were bestowed on the productions of seven theatres. In 1973 the Awards night was first telecast by CBS. During that same year, the Jeff Committee extended its coverage and recognition to include the productions of non-Equity theatres through the creation of a Non-Equity Wing of the Joseph Jefferson Awards Committee. Only five non-Equity theatres had productions judged in that first season, and three awards were presented the following fall. Currently these awards are given at a separate Non-Equity Wing Awards Night each spring. Selection committee The current Joseph Jefferson Committee consists of up to 55 men and women who come to the committee with an academic background in theatre, significant professional experience, a history of theatre involvement, and/or years of consistent theatre attendance in Chicago and in other major theatre capitals of the world. A volunteer, non- profit organization, The Jeff Committee does not have specific terms for its members. However, members must meet specific judging standards and can vote on the final ballot each season only if they have met their responsibilities for that complete year. While many of the judges have retained long-standing membership histories, a few rotate off each year as new members are invited to join the committee. Nomination Each year at the request of the theaters, the members of Jeff Committee see the Jeff-eligible, locally produced shows. They nominate and eventually select recipients \\"for outstanding achievement\\" in the following categories: Production, Director, Actor and Actress in a Principal Role, Actor and Actress in a Supporting Role, in the two categories of Plays and Musicals. Awards are also given for Production, Direction, Actor and Actress in a Revue, and Cameo Performance, as well as Ensemble, Choreography, Scenic Design, Lighting Design, Costume Design, Original Music, Musical Direction, Sound Design, New Work and Adaptation. Two general types of awards are given in each category: \\"Jeff Awards\\" are for work done under an Actors' Equity Association contract, while \\"Non-Equity Jeff Awards\\" are for non-union work. On occasion, special awards are given for achievements, accomplishments, or services in other areas of the theatre. Award recipients are determined by secret ballot. The Equity Awards are available to theater companies within 45 miles of the intersection of State and Madison streets. The Non-Equity Awards are available only to companies within the city limits of Chicago. Criticism The Jeff Awards and Committee have been criticized by Chicago theater professionals, specifically those in the non-Equity sector, for not recognizing critically acclaimed productions and seeming to not be willing to reward daring works in Chicago theater. In a more outspoken criticism of the awards, Time Out Chicago publishes a \\"They Wuz Robbed\\" feature for both the non-Equity and Equity nominations every year.

Some example genes in humans include: * BRCA2 and BRCA1 * BLM * NBS1 DNA damage prevents the normal enzymatic synthesis of DNA by the replication fork. At damaged sites in the genome, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells utilize a number of postreplication repair (PRR) mechanisms to complete DNA replication. Chemically modified bases can be bypassed by either error-prone or error-free translesion polymerases, or through genetic exchange with the sister chromatid. The replication of DNA with a broken sugar-phosphate backbone is most likely facilitated by the homologous recombination proteins that confer resistance to ionizing radiation. The activity of PRR enzymes is regulated by the SOS response in bacteria and may be controlled by the postreplication checkpoint response in eukaryotes. The elucidation of PRR mechanisms is an active area of molecular biology research, and the terminology is currently in flux. For instance, PRR has recently been referred to as \\"DNA damage tolerance\\" to emphasize the instances in which postreplication DNA damage is repaired without removing the original chemical modification to the DNA. While the term PRR has most frequently been used to describe the repair of single-stranded postreplication gaps opposite damaged bases, a more broad usage has been suggested. In this case, the term PRR would encompasses all processes that facilitate the replication of damaged DNA, including those that repair replication-induced double-strand breaks. Melanoma cells are commonly defective in postreplication repair of DNA damages that are in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, a type of damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. A particular repair process that appears to be defective in melanoma cells is homologous recombinational repair. Defective postreplication repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers can lead to mutations that are the primary driver of melanoma.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie. Their nickname is the \\"Cardinals\\". Their colors are cardinal red, white, and blue. Background Central Catholic High School began as St. Catherine‚Äôs High School in 1915. It relocated and was renamed Central Christian in 1961. Since then, the school has moved yet again and is now known as DuBois Area Catholic School. It opened in 2002. The current high school is part of a pre- kindergarten through grade twelve facility with four wings. The elementary area of the school is divided into two separate wings. The younger children‚Äôs rooms are in one hallway whereas the older elementary students have their own, nearly identical hallway. In addition to classrooms, this area of the school contains its own library, office, music room, art room and auxiliary gym. The middle and high school wings are located on the complete opposite side of the building. Similar to the young students being generally separated from the older pupils in the elementary wing, the middle and high school students are mostly separated as well. This area of the building also has its own library, music room, art room, science labs and office. Also located on campus are a cafeteria, gymnasium, auditorium, chapel, business office, guidance office and at least one computer lab per wing. Every room in the building is equipped to accommodate the advancements of technology.

This ist similar to a skwal which uses fixed-heel bindings mounted in line with each other. History When experimenting with successively narrower alpine snowboards to allow for quicker turns, the Fey brothers ended up with a board that could not fit hard- plate snowboard bindings, and tried telemark bindings instead. After a successful trial down a mogul run at Killington (one of the only remaining open trails in New England at the end of that ski season), they continued to refine the design. The Teleboard earned them two patents between 1997 and 1999. The Fey Bros went on to found Telemarkdown.com and continue to sell Teleboards as well as Telemark and AT ski gear in their two New England shops. Physical characteristics The unique binding alignment coupled with the use of free-heel bindings on the teleboard allows the rider to face forward and have complete freedom over weight distribution. The rider can focus their weight down on the center of the board to flex it and carve tightly, or distribute weight over the length to keep the board straighter. Also, weight can be shifted vertically, by standing tall or kneeling. This extension and flexion is an essential part of carved turns, and the extent of them that the teleboard allows lends itself to deep or extreme carving. The extremely close angle of the bindings, along with the long length and narrow width of the board make the Teleboard extremely easy to use for quick edge changes, rendering the board ideal for riding bumps, carving tight turns, and reacting to unexpected obstacles. Also, the edge radius of Teleboards tends to be very small, comparable to slalom skis, which is unusual for skiing or riding devices as long as a teleboard. Because the bindings are mounted almost in- line with the direction of the board, it is possible for the rider to use poles, which can aid the rider in learning the sport. Patents The patent for the Teleboard is held by Uniboard, Inc. (US Patent #6000711) The abstract is as follows: > A skiboard system is provided, which includes a divisible skiboard having > left and right skiboard halves and left and right loose heel binding. When > the skiboard halves are joined, the skiboard has a central, waist portion > and an upward curving front shovel area. The left and right loose heel > bindings may be secured on the left and right skiboard halves when the > skiboard halves are divided, oriented substantially parallel to the > longitudinal axes or the skiboard halves. When the skiboard halves are > joined, the left and right loose heel bindings are mounted on opposite sides > of the skiboard waist at an acute angle less than 35 degrees from the > longitudinal axis. No implementation of this 'split' board described in the patent is commercially available. All commercial teleboards are made of a single monolithic piece, and therefore are most appropriate for resort skiing, not the backcountry approaches which would be possible with a splitboard. Specifications There are currently four different models of teleboards ranging from 168 cm to 191 cm. =Pipe Dreamer 168= The Pipe Dreamer 168 was designed for the pipe and park, and for younger, lighter riders. The deck is 168 cm long, with dimensions (Tip / Waist / Tail) of 187mm, 120mm, 183mm. The sidecut radius is 9.4m with an effective edge of 148 cm. =Legend 181= The legend 181 is based on the design of the original Teleboard. It was the first Teleboard to make the descent of Mount Washington's Tuckerman Ravine. The deck is 181 cm long with dimensions (Tip / Waist / Tail) of 195mm, 122mm, and 179mm. The sidecut radius is 9.3m with an effective edge of 158 cm. =Pursuit 191= The Pursuit 191 along with the King Carve 191 are the two longest Teleboards available. The Pursuit 191 was designed to be the longer brethren to the Legend 181 for those who want the additional stability which comes with a longer plank. The dimensions (Tip / Waist / Tail ) are 199 cm, 127 cm, and 185 cm. The sidecut radius is 9.3m with an effective edge of 168 cm. =King Carve 191= The King Carve 191 was a stiffer version of the Pursuit 191 mounted with 25mm solid polymer risers and Rottefella Cobra K hardwire bindings. The dimensions are identical to the Pursuit 191. =2013 Mark F 186= 186cm. Added early rise; gives the board much better float in powder AND also makes the tip easier to manage in moguls =2013 Sheriff 198= Even bigger. Even more stable.

In 1973, she became a launch author for the new Mills & Boon-Harlequin Presents line of category romance novels. Presents line books were more sexually explicit than the previous line, Romance, under which Winspear had been published. She was chosen to be a launch author because she, along with Anne Mather and Anne Hampson were the most popular and prolific British authors of Mills and Boon. In 1970 Winspear commented that she wrote her leading males as if they were 'capable of rape'. This comment caused uproar and lead to her receiving hate mail. Biography Violet Winspear was born on 28 April 1928 in London, England. She worked in a factory since 1942, when in 1961 she sold her first romance novels to Mills & Boon. In 1963, she became a full-time writer. She wrote from her home in the south-east England, an area which she never left, but she researched her far- flung settings at the local library. She said: \\"The real aim of romance is to provide escape and entertainment\\", but when in 1970 she commented: \\"I get my heroes so that they're lean and hard muscled and mocking and sardonic and tough and tigerish and single, of course. Oh and they've got to be rich and then I make it that they're only cynical and smooth on the surface. But underneath they're well, you know, sort of lost and lonely. In need of love but, when roused, capable of breathtaking passion and potency. Most of my heroes, well all of them really, are like that. They frighten but fascinate. They must be the sort of men who are capable of rape: men it's dangerous to be alone in the room with.\\" The comment, that they were 'capable of rape' caused uproar and lead to her receiving hate mail. Violet Winspear died at January 1989 after a long battle with cancer. Book Notes Violet Winspear's novels take the readers around the world. Even though many of her storylines are uninspiring, she excels at boldly using the written words to vividly bring to life the surroundings of her plots. For example, The Palace of the Peacocks (1969). Many established Harlequin novelists such as Robyn Donald and Kay Thorpe, employ sexual antagonism in developing conflict in their stories. These devices are popular with modern readers. For instance, Robyn Donald creates leaping sexual awareness between men and women. Since men are quick to acknowledge this vital force, Robyn casts them into the role of hunter and as women label it as a weakness to despise and overcome, she makes them the prey. This is the adversarial set up that drives her plots forward. Employing the same motif of sexual antagonism, critics say that Winspear, contrasts her hero and heroine in such extremes that the heroine lacks awareness of her own sexuality against the hero who is fully aware of his. This lends her stories an acute imbalance in character development where the heroine is left bemused with an alpha male hero who exerts overwhelming control over every situation. For example, The Time of the Temptress (1978). Modern day critics will say that Winspear reinforces a non-entity driven personality of the heroine against a larger than life hero. It is not that the heroine lacks intelligence or initiative. But by today's standards she lacks self-esteem in her role as a woman. Whereas Winspear makes it clear as to the sex appeal of the hero, it is not always graphically described why the heroine would be attractive to the male. As a consequence, although the heroine is duly attracted to the hero, it can remain unconvincing to those used to having such attractions graphically spelled out as to why the hero is likewise attracted to the heroine. For example, The Awakening of Alice (1978). To modern readers, reading any of the older Harlequin romances can be painful in their depictions of women. What Winspear could do was beautifully capture a time, a place, and a British view of the world. Her descriptions of the internal dialogue of her heroines was innovative at a time when most heroines were two dimensional. One must consider the social mores of the mid 20th century. Although these books were written after the sexual revolution, it was still a \\"bad\\" woman and not a \\"good\\" girl who would choose to have sex. Therefore, having the choice taken away from the heroine by plot devices like being captured, or being forced to marry yet secretly in love with a hero took that choice away. The heroine relieved herself of moral responsibility in the eyes of the reader. The Time of the Temptress (1978) conveys its jungle surrounding very realistically, especially with an episode where an unsuspecting Eve is besieged by crabs. Caught amidst an African civil war, Eve and Wade are forced to make their escape out of the jungle on foot. Despite Wade's ceaseless taunts and jeers, in a case of Stockholm syndrome, where Eve finds herself totally dependent on Wade for her rescue, she falls in love with him. Even an unimaginative melodrama such as the Valdez Marriage (1977) retains its vivid portrayal of place and atmosphere. In Valdez Marriage, a young girl is lured to the side of a school friend by his overbearing brother. She is blamed for the accident which crippled her friend, even though the latter's uninvited groping caused the car accident. Add to this a dour housekeeper, sexy distant relative and an ancient mansion. The Palace of the Peacock (1969) is a Violet Winspear classic. In this story Winspear showcases a Java island and its people with extreme delicacy contributing to both realism and a sense of escapist reading one and the same time for her post-World War II English readers. In The Palace of the Peacock (1969) Temple Lane reveals a streak for adventure when she travels to a far away island in the Java Seas in search of her fianc√© Nick. A disillusioned Temple takes the initiative to pose as a boy to obtain the last cabin bunk available in the outgoing steamer. She then accepts a temporary job offer by Dutchman Ryk van Helden, a local plantation manager. A criticism of this story must be that although Temple is excited by Ryk, the question goes unanswered as to why should Ryk find Temple desirable. It happens that in the island of Bayanura, Temple is the only white women for miles. And so, despite Temple Lane's spunky attempts at adventure, critics point to another of Winspear's unoriginal heroines. A plain Jane Alice in Awakening of Alice (1978) steps out of her comfort zone as she travels to a Greek island to tidy up a mess created by her glamorous sister. The awakening of love in this story is more convincing since it also gives a reason for the hero's attraction for Alice who resembles his past fianc√©. However, the imbalance in the equity between the two main characters is apparent when Alice is held against her wishes by the Greek hero, with whom she falls in love. Another classic Court of the Veils (1968) also stands out for this reason because the hero spells out his attraction for the heroine for being a 'deep girl' compared to her foil who preferred much dancing and frivolous gaiety. Joanna in Rain Tree Valley (1971) reads an advertising for home help. She answers the add, and gets the job. Adam, the alpha male hero is abrasive, but Joanna falls for him anyway. The heroine of Black Douglas (1971), forever complaining about the deficiencies in her looks, is accepted by the hero who is blind.

The recently planted woodland hopes to recreate a naturally regenerating mature woodland within an area consisting of a mosaic of planted woodland, remnant hedgerows, grassland and saltmarsh. The woodland provides a year-round home for many species including Roe deer, foxes, buzzards and kestrels.  History  = 16th and 17th Century (Cartography, Timothy Pont, Joan Blaeu) = The original course of the River Carron can be viewed as a digital image on the National Library of Scotland website. M.S.32, the particular survey of interest is one of many by Timothy Pont who completed a universal survey of Scotland on foot between 1583 and 1614. The work was never published in his lifetime, after Pont's death in 1614 James VI planned to purchase the materials however due to the turbulence of the times they lay forgotten. Sir John Scot, Lord Scotstarvit enlisted Robert Gordon of Straloch and his son James Gordon. In 1641 the surviving manuscripts were carried to Amsterdam, there they revised Pont's maps with the aid of Joan Blaeu. Whilst in Amsterdam in 1645, Sir John Scot dictated from memory the description of several districts, this was accompanied by a Royal letter from Charles I. The works were finally published in the Geographi√¶ Blaeuani√¶ volumen quintum by Joan Blaeu in 1654.

This is not clear on the digital images but can be seen on the reproduction maps published jointly by Collins Bartholomew and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society who own one of the original Blaeu's edition of Stirlingshire. = 18th Century (Carron Iron Works, Charles Gascoigne, John Ogilvie) = The River Carron of today is man- made and since the destruction of Arthur's O'On has seen many changes, when Carron Iron works was established, they used the river to power their mills and to transport the raw materials and finished products. Charles Gascoigne played a prominent part in the makeup of the river, and the woodlands surrounding the area, he was married to Mary, daughter of Samuel Garbett, a founding partner of Carron Iron Works in 1759. Gascoigne became a partner in Carron Iron Works in 1765, presumably because the Board of Ordinance granted the works a contract to supply armaments to the British Armed Forces in 1764 and he acqustraited the building of parts for James Watt's steam engine in 1765. By this time the Carron Iron Works had come to be at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, later, boasting the largest Iron works in Europe. In reward, The Carron House was built for him ca. 1759 - 1773 by Francis/Samuel Garbett and Co. He became manager of the Carron Iron Works in 1769 and thus set out to improve the quality of the end product, in 1773 the Carron Iron Works were awarded a Royal Charter however the quality of the pig iron and cast iron had deteriorated to the point where in the same year, 1773, the Royal Navy contracts were cancelled. Thanks to Charles Gascoigne much of the landscape wehe has changed has remained unchanged to this day, as well as straightening the river, lands on both sides of the river were improved and as a consequence brought greater profit to the lairds of the day. = 20th and 21st Century (Local Planning, Planting, Correct Naming, The Helix Project) = The first community planting was the result of an advert in The Falkirk Herald. The area planted in March 1996 was the site of Dalderse Mill Farm which was the last working farm in the Dawson ward of Falkirk. The second area planted in March 1998 was Farm Road Community Woodland which incorporated memorial plantings. The third area planted was Cobblebrae Community Woodland in March 2000. All sites were planted as a native mixed woodland. By 2001 there was some confusion regarding the areas that were planted and so a community group from the Dawson Ward of Falkirk called the Abbotshaugh Alliance was formed to represent the community interest. The name Abbotshaugh was chosen because it is an historically correct name for the land where the first and second planting took place. The Abbotshaugh Alliance (AA) was then amalgamated into the Abbotshaugh Community Woodlands Group (ACWG). Abbotshaugh Alliance had an open day for local residents to show support for the local community woodland and at the same time it allowed them to bring up any concerns. A report was written up following the feedback from the day. From 2004 The Abbotshaugh Community Woodlands Group pushed forward with funding for the local area, garnering interest from around the country The Abbotshaugh Sentinel project The artist Jephson Robb who was commissioned to design the Sentinel Project took part in a discussion with local residents of the area at Callendar House on 25 April 2012. All of the work carried out by various community groups and organisations throughout the years have led to the vast support and go ahead in the local area for The Helix Project which is situated at the end of the Forth and Clyde Canal. Incorporated into Helix Falkirk is the Helix Cycle Path The Helix Around Town Tour is a 16-mile circular cycle route starting at Falkirk Stadium and connecting The Helix, The Falkirk Wheel and Callendar Park. It has several sections in the Abbotshaugh Community Woodlands.

Its capital was Zagreb. Until the 18th century, the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia included only a small north-western part of present-day Croatia around Zagreb, and a small strip of coastland around Rijeka that was not part of the Ottoman Empire or part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. Between 1744 and 1868 the Kingdom of Croatia included a subordinate autonomous kingdom, the Kingdom of Slavonia. The territory of the Slavonian kingdom was recovered from the Ottoman Empire, and was subsequently part of the Habsburg Military Frontier for a period. In 1744 these territories were organized as the Kingdom of Slavonia and included within the Kingdom of Croatia as an autonomous part. In 1868 both were merged again into the newly formed Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.  History and government  Battle of Moh√°cs 1526 by Bertalan Sz√©kely = Habsburg rule = Following the fall of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary at the Battle of Moh√°cs, in 1527 the Croatian and Hungarian nobles needed to decide on a new king. The bulk of the Croatian nobility convened the Croatian Parliament in Cetin and chose to join the Habsburg monarchy under the Austrian king Ferdinand I von Habsburg.Milan Kruhek: Cetin, grad izbornog sabora Kraljevine Hrvatske 1527, Karlovaƒçka ≈Ωupanija, 1997, Karlovac Some nobles dissented and supported John Z√°polya, but the Habsburg option still prevailed in 1540, when John Z√°polya died. Territory recovered by the Austrians from the Ottoman Empire was formed in 1745 as the Kingdom of Slavonia, subordinate to the Croatian Kingdom. In 1804 the Habsburg Monarchy became the Austrian Empire which annexed the Venetian Republic in 1814 and established the Kingdom of Dalmatia. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (by which the Austrian Empire became the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement (Nagodba) of 1868, the Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Slavonia were joined to create the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Hungarian part of the Empire, while the Kingdom of Dalmatia remained a crown land in the Austrian part of the Empire. = Ottoman incursion = The change of leadership was far from a solution to the war with the Ottomans, in fact, the Ottoman Empire gradually expanded in the 16th century to include most of Slavonia, western Bosnia and Lika. Croatian territory under Habsburg rule was 25 years later reduced to about 20,000 km¬≤. In 1558, the parliaments of Croatia and Slavonia were united after many centuries into one. The centre of the Croatian state moved northward from coastal Dalmatia, as these lands were conquered by the Ottomans. The town of Zagreb gained importance, as did nearby Vara≈ædin.Ivo Goldstein: Croatia: A History, Zagreb, 1999, p. 36 Taking advantage of the growing conflict between King Sigismund II of Poland and Emperor Maximilian II, Suleiman the Magnificent started his sixth raid of Hungary in 1565 with 100,000 troops. They successfully progressed northwards until 1566 when they took a small detour to capture the outpost of Siget (Szigetv√°r) which they failed to capture ten years previously. The small fort was defended by Count Nikola IV Zrinski and 2,300‚Äì3,000 men. They were able to hold their ground for a month, and decimated the Ottoman army before being wiped out themselves. This siege, now known as the Battle of Szigetv√°r, bought enough time to allow Austrian troops to regroup before the Ottomans could reach Vienna.Dupuy, R. Ernest and Dupuy, Trevor. The Encyclopedia of Military History. New York: Harper & Row, 1970. Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski by Oton Ivekoviƒá.

It was during that time replaced with the Red-White flag, but was allowed again in 1860. By orders of the king in 1553 and 1578, large areas of Croatia and Slavonia adjacent to the Ottoman Empire were carved out into the Military Frontier (Vojna krajina or Vojna granica) and ruled directly from Vienna's military headquarters. Due to the dangerous proximity to the Ottoman armies, the area became rather deserted, so Austria encouraged the settlement of Serbs, Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks and Rusyns/Ukrainians and other Slavs in the Military Frontier, creating an ethnic patchwork. The negative effects of feudalism escalated in 1573 when the peasants in northern Croatia and Slovenia rebelled against their feudal lords over various injustices such as unreasonable taxation or abuse of women in the Croatian and Slovenian peasant revolt. Ambroz Matija Gubec and other leaders of the mutiny raised peasants to arms in over sixty fiefs throughout the country in January 1573, but their uprising was crushed by early February. Matija Gubec and thousands of others were publicly executed shortly thereafter, in a rather brutal manner in order to set an example for others. After the Bihaƒá fort finally fell to the army of the Bosnian vizier Hasan Pasha Predojeviƒá in 1592, only small parts of Croatia remained unconquered. The remaining 16,800 km¬≤ where around 400,000 inhabitants lived were referred to as the \\"remnants of remnants of the once great and renowned Kingdom of Croatia\\" ().Vjekoslav Klaiƒá: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr≈°etka XIX. stoljeƒáa, Knjiga peta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 480Ivo Goldstein: Sisaƒçka bitka 1593., Zagreb, 1994, p. 30 = 17th and 18th centuries = By the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was driven out of Ottoman Hungary and Croatia, and Austria brought the empire under central control.

Other lands of the Austrian Empire are in white (and light grey). The Austrian imperial army was victorious against the Ottomans in 1664 but Emperor Leopold failed to capitalize on the success when he signed the Peace of Vasv√°r in which Hungary and Croatia were prevented from regaining territory lost to the Ottoman Empire. This caused unrest among the Hungarian and Croatian nobility which plotted against the emperor in what became known as the Zrinski‚ÄìFrankopan Conspiracy in Croatia, but they weren't powerful enough to actually do something about it, even though they negotiated with both the French and the Ottomans. Imperial spies uncovered the conspiracy and on April 30, 1671 executed four esteemed Croatian and Hungarian noblemen involved in it, Petar Zrinski, Fran Krsto Frankopan, Ferenc N√°dasdy III and Erazmo Tatenbach, in Wiener Neustadt.The Price of Freedom: A History of East Central Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present, p.87Ivo Goldstein: Croatia: A History, Zagreb, 1999, p. 43 Croatia was one of the crown lands that supported Emperor Charles VI's Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and supported Empress Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession of 1741‚Äì48 and the Croatian Parliament signed their own Pragmatic Sanction of 1712. Subsequently, the Empress made significant contributions to Croatian matters, by making several changes in the administrative control of the Military Frontier, the feudal and tax system. In 1767 she founded the Croatian Royal Council (Croatian: Hrvatsko kraljevinsko vijeƒáe) as royal government of Croatia and Slavonia, with seat in Vara≈ædin, later in Zagreb, presided by the ban, but it was abolished in 1779 when Croatia was relegated to just one seat in the governing council of Hungary (the Royal Hungarian Council of Lieutenancy, also known as the Hungarian Vice-regency Council, headed by the palatine), held by the ban of Croatia. The empress also gave the independent port of Rijeka to Croatia in 1776. However, she also ignored the Croatian Parliament. With the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, its possessions in eastern Adriatic mostly came under the authority of France which passed its rights to Austria the same year. Eight years later they were restored to France as the Illyrian Provinces, but won back to the Austrian crown by 1815. = 19th century = Field Marshal count Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, Ban of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and Commander of the Croatian Military Frontier. In the 19th century Croatian romantic nationalism emerged to counteract the non-violent but apparent Germanization and Magyarization. The Croatian national revival began in the 1830s with the Illyrian movement. The movement attracted a number of influential figures and produced some important advances in the Croatian language and culture. The champion of the Illyrian movement was Ljudevit Gaj who also reformed and standardized the Croatian literary language. Official language in Croatia was Latin until 1847 when it became Croatian. By the 1840s, the movement had moved from cultural goals to resisting Hungarian political demands. By the royal order of January 11, 1843, originating from the chancellor Metternich, the use of the Illyrian name and insignia in public was forbidden. This deterred the movement's progress but it couldn't stop the changes in the society that had already started. In the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, the Croatian Ban Jelaƒçiƒá cooperated with the Austrians in quenching the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 by leading a military campaign into Hungary, successful until the Battle of P√°kozd. Despite this contribution, Croatia was later subject to Baron Alexander von Bach's absolutism as well as the Hungarian hegemony under ban Levin Rauch when the Empire was transformed into a dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867. From 1848 to 1850 Croatia was governed by the Ban's Council (Croatian: Bansko vijeƒáe) appointed by the Ban and the Parliament or the Croatian-Slavonian Diet (Croatian: Sabor; in 1848 first Diet with the elected representatives was summoned). In 1850 the Ban's Council was transformed into Ban's Government (Croatian: Banska vlada) which, after the introduction of the absolutism (31 December 1851), was under the direct control of the Austrian Imperial Government in Vienna. From 1854 to 1861 the Imperial-Royal Croatian-Slavonian Lieutenancy (presided by the ban) in Zagreb (Croatian: Carsko-kraljevsko namjesni≈°tvo za Hrvatsku i Slavoniju), under the Austrian Ministry of Interior, was the main governing body of the Croatian-Slavonian crown land (Kronland). After the fall of Bach's absolutism (the October Diploma of 1860 and the February Patent of 1861), the Royal Croatian-Slavonian Court Chancellery (Croatian: Kraljevska hrvatsko-slavonska dvorska kancelarija) in Vienna - from 1861 to 1862 \\"courtly (aulic) department for Croatia and Slavonia\\" (ministry) - and the Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Royal Council of Lieutenancy (also known as the Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Vice-regency Council, it was headed by the ban; Croatian: Kraljevsko namjesniƒçko vijeƒáe) in Zagreb were founded. These remained Croatian-Slavonian government until 1868.All these institutions have \\"Dalmatian\\" name included, even Dalmatia (after 1815) was and remained crown land (kingdom) of the Austrian part of the Habsburg Monarchy (from 1804 Austrian Empire); it was nominally considered as a part of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia even long before Croatian-Hungarian Settlement of 1868. Ban Jelaƒçiƒá had succeeded in the abolition of serfdom in Croatia, which eventually brought about massive changes in society: the power of the major landowners was reduced and arable land became increasingly subdivided, to the extent of risking famine. Many Croatians started emigrating to the New World countries in this period, a trend that would continue throughout the next hundred years and create a large Croatian diaspora. The Illyrian movement was rather broad in scope, both nationalist and pan-Slavist. It would eventually develop into two major causes: * a Croatian national cause aimed primarily at the unification and independence of the people of Croatia, headed by people like the parliamentarian Ante Starƒçeviƒá, who formed the Party of Rights in 1861 * a pan-South-Slavic, Yugoslav cause also oriented towards the integration of the neighboring South Slavic nations, organized through the People's Party, and headed by people like bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer, who founded the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1867 and re-founded the University of Zagreb in 1874 The loss of Croatian domestic autonomy was rectified a year after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, when in 1868 the Croatian‚ÄìHungarian Settlement was negotiated, which combined Croatia and Slavonia into the autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. With this agreement, the Kingdom of Croatia received autonomy in administrative, educational, religious and judicial affairs.Catholic Encyclopedia However, the governor (ban) was still appointed by Hungary, 55% percent of all tax money went to Budapest, and Hungary had authority over the biggest sea port of Rijeka (something that was reportedly not part of the Settlement actually agreed upon). Demographics According to the 1802 data, the population of the Kingdom of Croatia included 400,000 (98.8%) Roman Catholics, 4,800 (1.2%) Eastern Orthodox Christians and 40 Protestants.Mladen Lorkoviƒá, Narod i zemlja Hrvata, page 86 In 1840, a Hungarian statistician Fenyes Elek analyzed the ethnicity in the countries belonging to the Hungarian Crown. According to the data he collected and processed, 526,550 people lived in the Kingdom of Croatia, out of which 519,426 (98.64%) were Croats, 3,000 (0.56%) Germans, 2,900 (0.55%) Serbs and 1,037 (0.19%) Jews.Elek F√©nyes, Magyarorsz√°g statistik√°ja, Trattner-K√°rolyi, Pest 1842, pages 50-52Mladen Lorkoviƒá, Narod i zemlja Hrvata, page 87 Population data by counties: Primorje County * 40,390 Croats * 2,000 Germans * 200 Hungarians * 105 Jews * 67 Greeks Vara≈ædin County * 130,678 Croats * 153 Serbs * 474 Jews Zagreb County * 279,991 Croats * 1,000 Germans * 978 Serbs * 313 Jews Kri≈æevci County * 68,367 Croats * 1,769 Serbs * 145 Jews The first modern population census was conducted in 1857 and it recorded religion of the citizens.

The new flag was the Croatian tricolor of red, white, and blue, and it was to remain the symbol of Croatia up to the present day. The coat of arms adopted in 1848 was an amalgam of three coats of arms, one for Croatia, another for the Kingdom of Dalmatia, and another for the Kingdom of Slavonia. The Kingdom also used the name \\"Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia\\" during certain periods (though this was not recognized by the Empire). The Kingdom still controlled the Kingdom of Slavonia, but did not control the Kingdom of Dalmatia. In 1852 the imperial Austrian government, which never recognized the tricolor as official, banned its use, along with the coat of arms. Between 1852 and 1861 the Kingdom of Croatia used the red and white flag, and its old chequy coat of arms. The tricolor was used again after 1861 (October Diploma and February Patent) and became official after 1868.

They moved to Gallipolis, where he bought a restaurant named the Malt Shop in the early 1940s. When Evans was inducted into the Army in 1943, he sold his interest in the restaurant to a friend. Bob Evans Farms got its start when Evans began making sausage on his southeastern Ohio farm to serve at a 12-stool diner he owned in nearby Gallipolis in 1948. Evans could not find a source of satisfactory sausage, so he began making his own, slaughtering his own hogs and using the best parts of the hog. The building where he made the sausage was built with open ends, at the suggestion of his father, so it could be used as a machinery shed if the sausage business failed. In 1953, a group of friends and family recognized the growing demand for Evans's sausage and became his business partners by establishing Bob Evans Farms. The original Bob Evans Restaurant on the farm was called The Sausage Shop. Although it started with 12 stools, today the restaurant can seat 134.  Bob Evans Restaurants  In 1953, the business was incorporated as Bob Evans Farms Inc. By 1957, the company opened a total of four sausage plants to keep up with demand. In 1963, Bob Evans Farms Inc. was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange with an original issue of 160,000 shares. Evans served as a director and president of the company until his retirement on December 31, 1986. Local restaurants weren't willing to buy Evans' sausage, so Evans started his own, with the first opening on his farm in 1962. These restaurants were designed in a red and white color \\"Steamboat Victorian\\" style.

Unlike other games in its genre, Dream Match Tennis was aimed to produce a more realistic depiction of the sport, requiring more skill from the player in order to direct their shots accurately. Due to the small size of the Bimboosoft Company, they were not able to use the same level of graphical effects in Dream Match Tennis as other companies such as Sega could with games like Virtua Tennis 3.  Playing the game  There are 5 different kinds of shot in Dream Match Tennis; Normal Shot (also hits a 'normal speed' serve, usually used as a second serve) Hard Shot (also hits a 'hard' serve, usually used as a first serve) Slice Shot (also hits a 'slice' serve, usually used as a first serve) Lob Drop Shot A Super-Hard Shot has also been recently added, which is harder than the hard shot, but with the added risk of the shot going long or into the net. The normal shot has been criticized for some of the characters, as it is so weak for the likes of Mason that a hard shot must be used the entire time, negating the use of the normal shot. Unlike most tennis games, Dream Match Tennis is controlled primarily through the use of timing rather than simply the directional buttons. If a player wants to hit a cross-court shot, they have to hit the ball slightly early. If they want to hit the ball in the opposite direction, they have to hit it slightly later (i.e., when it's going behind the player's character). The directional buttons can be used to get extra angle or direction; for instance, the downwards directional button makes the ball go short, and is useful for hitting angled cross-court shots. Serving is also performed via correct timing- each character has a unique serving motion, and the shot button must be pressed at the correct moment in order for the ball to go into the court. The moment that the shot button must be pressed varies depending on what kind of serve is being hit, and at what pace the serve is being hit at (pressing the upwards button makes the serve more powerful, whereas pressing the downwards button makes it travel more slowly). The serve is noticeably more effective in Dream Match Tennis than in other tennis games, and the characters with the more powerful serves are capable of hitting up to 14 aces per set (depending on the quality of the opponent).  Players  The number of playable characters has risen to 12 since the release of the game, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. All of the characters are based on real players, with their names altered in order to avoid licensing issues: R. Ford (based on Roger Federer) - Considered to be one of the best characters in the game, Ford has powerful groundshots with much spin, is capable of serving at up to 128 mph (his serve speed has been reduced from earlier versions), is quick around the court and is also good at volleying. Ford has been weakened in the last few versions of the game due to balancing issues. R. Nelson (based on Rafael Nadal) - Along with Ford is thought of as one of the strongest characters, with a powerful forehand that can generate extreme angles, a strong backhand and good speed around the court. The strength of Nelson's serve is somewhat of an issue with some players of the game, as it is considered too effective when compared to Nadal's serve in reality. P. Scott (based on Pete Sampras) - Slightly weaker than Ford and Nelson, Scott nevertheless has a very powerful serve (he is capable of serving up to 135 mph), a powerful forehand and solid backhand, with good volleys. A. Arnold (based on Andre Agassi) - A strong baseline player, Arnold is capable of hitting winners from either his forehand or backhand very easily. However, this is offset by his poor volleys and relatively ineffective serve. S. Evans (based on Stefan Edberg) - Rarely used in multiplayer matches, this player has an accurate serve, very good volleys and a powerful backhand, but his weak forehand and slowness around the court make it difficult to compete with the better characters when using him. B. Baron (based on Boris Becker) - Has a powerful serve that is easy to time (around the same speed as Ford), but is fairly lumbering around the court with only average groundshots. A. Richmond (based on Andy Roddick) - The newest addition to the game, this character has a very powerful serve (he can hit it up to 150 mph), and a strong forehand, but his backhand and volleying ability are among the worst in the game. He is also very slow. I. Leach (based on Ivan Lendl) - A powerful baseline player, his forehand is one of the strongest in the game, but tough to control when using super hard shots and his backhand is also very strong. However, he is also slow and his serve, while being quite powerful, is hard to aim accurately. M. Cooper (based on Michael Chang) - Extremely quick around the court, with an average forehand and a good backhand, and a serve that is difficult to time. J. Mason (based on John McEnroe) - This character has very weak groundshots, and a serve that, while also lacking power, is capable of getting aces due to the amount of spin on it. He is also quick around the court, with good volleys. J. Mason is the only character available to use online in the free demo of the game, and is consequently used frequently in multiplayer matches. This has become an annoyance with some players who have purchased the game, because Mason is unable to maintain a rally with some of the more hard hitting players such as Ford or Nelson. S. Gibson (based on Steffi Graf) - The only female character in the game, she is virtually never used in an online match because each one of her shots is among the worst in the game. J. Cain (based on Jimmy Connors) - Cain has a very weak serve (only capable of reaching just over 100 mph), but his groundshots are powerful and he is able to easily hit winners. However, the fact that they do not have much spin means they often go in the net when going for angled shots. His volleys are also among the worst in the game. B. Banks (based on Bj√∂rn Borg) - A good baseline player, Banks is somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades, with average power on each of his shots and mediocre speed around the court. The characters most often used in online games are Ford, Nelson, Richmond and Arnold.  Game modes  Exhibition - This is where a match (either singles or doubles) can be played between any two characters. This can either be a human against the computer, of which there are a number of different difficulties (with 'beginner' being the easiest, and 'insane' being the hardest), or a human against another human (either using a gamepad, or online). Doubles matches cannot be played online yet. Challenge - This is a single-player mode, where a player using any character has to beat 4 randomly chosen characters on each of the 4 Grand Slam surfaces. Unlike 'exhibition' mode, the computer difficulty only ranges from beginner to pro, with no insane level. World Tour - The player chooses a character and has to play in a number of events around the world against computer controlled opponents, trying to reach the ranking of world number 1. Practice - This is where a player can practice any kind of shot with any character.

Garlin's 15-year-old daughter is alleged to have been a willing participant in her mother's murder and the abuse of her brother. The case drew attention to deficiencies in the U.S. state of Florida's child-protection system.  Overview  The adults involved were Candace L. Clark (born February 20, 1984); Michael J. Sisk (born December 22, 1981), Clark's boyfriend, and Michaela Shawn Clerc (born July 13, 1986), reportedly the slain woman's lover. The juvenile was 15-year-old Felicia Mae Garlin (born August 28, 1991), daughter of the deceased and sister of the abused boy. Abuse Portage, Wisconsin, law-enforcement officers became aware of the situation on June 15, 2007, when following up on a Lake County, Florida, warrant for Clark, who was charged with unlawfully removing her 2-year-old daughter from the foster-care custody of Clerc's parents. While local media routinely reported on the process, national media began coverage when four individuals were arraigned by video hookup in Columbia County (WI) Circuit Court on July 20. By the next day, international news agencies had picked up the story.Columbia County Complaint, 20 June 2007 (*.pdf) Clark answered the door for the police. Allegedly providing an alias, she denied that Michael Sisk resided there. The officers consulted photographs and, since the woman resembled Clark and a photograph resembled the 2-year-old in question, further inquiry was made of the household. Clark eventually admitted that the child in question was known by two names. Fifteen-year-old Felicia Garlin (who also provided an alias) was interviewed, and said her mother was unavailable. Clerc was also questioned by the officers. When it became clear that the women were lying about their identities and there was reasonable cause to suspect that the child in question was the one abducted from Florida, the household was taken to the Portage police station and the three youngest children placed in protective custody (see pp. 11‚Äì12 of complaint). In addition to her 2-year-old, Clark had two other small daughters with her (a 1-year-old and a 3-month-old); both were subsequently placed in protective custody. The Florida complaint indicated that Sisk was the father of the two younger girls (including the child involved in the custody case). A WTMJ-TV story suggested that the youngest child may have been Felicia Garlin's, and indicated that Felicia's brother and the three small children would remain in the custody of the Wisconsin child-protection system. The head of the Florida child-protection system, Robert Butterworth, said \\"We are asking the Pinellas judge to relinquish jurisdiction in Florida and let them [i.e., the Wisconsin authorities] take care of the case.\\"Susan Latham Carr, \\"Local woman asks for custody of girls tied to torture case\\", Ocala, Florida Star Banner, 27 June 2007 At the police station, Clerc indicated that an 11-year-old boy who had been burned would be found at the house (p. 12 of complaint). The boy, identified by the initials \\"ACG\\", was found in a closet. Page 12 of the complaint states: > ACG, DOB 10/13/1995. ACG was sitting on the floor of an upstairs bedroom > closet with his knees pulled up to his chest. ACG had obvious wounds all > over his body. ACG started crying when he saw the officers and said that he > did not want to go to jail. The Garlin boy was taken to Divine Savior Hospital, and transferred to the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison. At the UW hospital, he was diagnosed with extensive injuries. Pages 12‚Äì13 of the complaint state: > Dr. Knox reports that ACG was admitted to the UW Emergency Department and > then to Dr. Knox's care. The physical examination of ACG showed the > following: overall‚Äì grossly burned with significant new and old injuries > from serial beatings and malnourishment.

Ms. Clark also admitted that she had > hogtied ACG as punishment.(p.13) Murder Authorities determined that Garlin's death was murder. According to page 14 of the complaint, the following statements detailed the murder of Tammie Garlin: > Ms. Clark was also able to determine that Tammie Garlin died on June 4, > 2007. She said this would have been early morning, shortly before daybreak. > She said that earlier in the day Felicia had kicked Tammie. Tammie was not > feeling well after that time.

Tammie was then put on the floor of the > bathroom but she wasn't moving. Ms. Clerc kicked Tammie and told her to \\"get > off the damn floor.\\" Mr. Sisk went into the bathroom and shut the door. He > came out a few minutes later and said something to the effect of \\"She's > dead.\\" Michaela laughed. Fifteen-year-old Felicia Garlin admitted helping with the burial of her mother; preparations were made during the day for burial after dark in the backyard. (p. 15) A search warrant was obtained, and Tammie Garlin's remains were exhumed. An autopsy was performed June 16, which \\"determined that the probable cause of Ms. Garlin's death was manual strangulation\\". Sisk was not at the residence. A detective acquired a cell phone number and called him, telling him he was wanted for questioning. Sisk left town, and police issued a bulletin for his arrest. > At the time he was arrested in Milwaukee on June 15, 2007, Mr. Sisk was on a > bus that was heading to Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Sisk also had in his > possession a bus ticket that had been purchased on June 15, 2007 at 10:40 > a.m. in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. This ticket had the ultimate destination > of Madisonville, Kentucky. Florida ripple effect The unlawful removal of the 2-year-old from her foster home reflected poorly on the Florida child-protection system. Martin E. Comas said in the Orlando Sentinel that it took Florida child-custody authorities four months to inform law enforcement: > Lake County sheriff's officials also said they were baffled as to why a > caseworker with the Safe Children Coalition in Pinellas County did not > report Courtney missing until Jan. 25, more than four months after she was > snatched from her Sorrento foster home by her mother, Candace L. > Clark.Martin E. Comas, \\"Relentless officer led police to find girl, 2\\", > Orlando Sentinel 17 June 2007 Carol Marbin Miller (in the June 22 Miami Herald) indicated that former Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth, six months into a stint as Secretary of the Department of Children and Families, was mystified that such a thing could happen and declined to place blame until an investigation was completed.Miller, Carol Marbin, \\"DCF chief calls loss of tot \`inexcusable\\" Miami Herald, 22 June 2007 Butterworth held a news conference on June 26, where he announced changes in the system.Sarah Langbein, \\"Missing 2-year-old's ordeal prompts changes at DCF\\", Orlando Sentinel, 27 June 2006 Another Herald article followed up with more details on June 23.Miller, Carol Marbin, \\"Tampa agency criticized for letting tot disappear\\", Miami Herald, 23 June 2007 The St. Petersburg Times published a longer analysis of the system's failure June 24.Melanie Ave, \\"Failures persist in child welfare\\", Saint Petersburg Times 24 June 2007 Stacye Scarborough, Clark's sister, was reported to have sought custody of her nieces a year before the events under discussion; authorities were non-communicative, and failed to report to her that the 2-year-old had been unlawfully removed from foster care. Scarborough would face \\"a myriad of legal hurdles if she hopes to get custody of her nieces\\";Susan Latham Carr, \\"Fighting for family\\", Ocala Star-Banner, July 2, 2007 since the custody was now an interstate issue, it would take three to six months of legal effort. The four suspects reportedly constituted an identity theft ring masterminded by Clark, who (with Sisk) had outstanding warrants in Colorado.Mike Wiggins, \\"Neighbors recall murder suspects as scam artists\\", Grand Junction, Colorado Daily Sentinel 22 June 2007 Arguing that Clark (not Sisk) was the gang leader, the article quotes a former neighbor who characterized Sisk as a \\"pinhead\\" and \\"dumber than a sack of hammers\\", and Clark was the controlling figure in the household. In northwestern Kentucky WFIE-TV reported, \\"Clark is wanted on 23 outstanding warrants in Henderson where she's accused of stealing the identity of a local woman\\".Jonathan Hardison, \\"WI Murder suspect takes Henderson woman's identity\\", WFIE-TV, June 21, 2007 Clark was the only member of the group willing to grant interviews, speaking to Sarah Langbein of the Orlando Sentinel in her jail cell.

She termed ACG \\"difficult\\" and requiring frequent discipline, unaware of the medical-examination findings. In a June 23 article by Portage Daily Register writer Matthew Call, she again denied any role in the murder. As for her relationship with Sisk, Call wrote: > Clark said she met Sisk at a high school in Hopkins County, Ky. They moved > to Florida because \\"that was my dream place to always live,\\" she said. Clark > also said she met Clerc in a chat room and at one point considered buying a > Sanford, Fla. house in which Clerc and Garlin lived.Matthew Call, \\"Clark in > interview from jail: 'I didn't kill her\\", Portage Daily Register 23 June > 2007 Charges The Wisconsin charges included first-degree murder, abuse of a corpse and child abuse. The complaint, dated 20 June 2007, made no mention of identity theft. Since the alleged crimes involved an interstate component, Federal charges were possible. All accused faced life imprisonment plus 100 years on the Wisconsin charges alone (Wisconsin does not have the death penalty). Jane E. Kohlwey, Columbia County district attorney, was in charge of the case. Colorado, Florida and Kentucky expressed an interest in trying the defendants. Since the combined cases were complex and involved multiple jurisdictions, Columbia County's small district attorney's office was under pressure. The Portage Daily Register voiced local concerns: \\"While a plea deal could be worked out that would reduce the expense to Columbia County taxpayers for four trials, a heavy workload still awaits police and prosecutors.\\"Todd Krysiak, \\"Kohlwey, Hahn prepare for more work on Oneida Street case\\", Portage Daily Register, June 26, 2007 A preliminary hearing was scheduled for November 19‚Äì20, 2007 following an earlier hearing on November 6 concerning videotaped evidence. Felicia Garlin's attorneys sought to have Garlin wear street clothing at the hearing, but the request was denied by the judge.Todd Krysiak, Garlin's bid to wear street clothes in court denied, Portage Daily Register, October 17, 2007 Sentencing Prosecutors discounted evidence and testimony that Candace Clark was the gang leader, contending that Michael Sisk must have controlled the group and filing extra charges against the man. The prosecution appeared to discount the role of Michaela Clerc, whose lesbian relationship with Tammy Garlin triggered the torture and homicide. Judge Alan White followed the prosecution's lead, imposing the following sentences on September 9, 2008: ;Michael Sisk: The male defendant was sentenced to a minimum of 58 years in prison: # Second-degree reckless homicide (Alford plea): 15 years' imprisonment, 10 years' extended supervision consecutive with all counts # Hiding a corpse (guilty plea): 5 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # False imprisonment (no contest plea): 2 years' imprisonment, 2 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Aggravated battery (no contest plea): 5 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Mayhem (guilty plea): 25 years' imprisonment, 15 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Child enticement, intentionally causing great harm (guilty plea): 3 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Causing mental harm to a child (guilty plea): 3 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # False imprisonment (guilty plea): 3 years' imprisonment, 3 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Intentionally contributing to the delinquency of a minor (no contest plea): 2 years' imprisonment, 2 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Obstructing an officer (no contest plea): 9 months' imprisonment served consecutively ;Candace Clark: The ringleader was sentenced to at least 47 years in prison: # Second-degree reckless homicide (no contest plea): 15 years' imprisonment, 10 years' extended supervision consecutive with all counts # Mayhem (guilty plea): 25 years' imprisonment, 15 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Child enticement (guilty plea): 5 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Physical abuse of a child (guilty plea): 10 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served concurrently # Mental harm to a child (guilty plea): 4 years' imprisonment, 4 years' extended supervision served consecutively # False imprisonment (guilty plea): 3 years' imprisonment, 3 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Causing delinquency of a minor (no contest plea): 3 years' imprisonment, 3 years' extended supervision served consecutively ;Michaela Clerc: The lover of the homicide victim was sentenced to 37 years in prison: # Mayhem (no contest plea): 25 years' imprisonment, 15 years' extended supervision consecutive with all counts # Physical abuse of a child (no contest plea): 7 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # Mental harm to a child (no contest plea): 5 years' imprisonment, 5 years' extended supervision served consecutively # False imprisonment (no contest plea): 3 years' imprisonment, 3 years' extended supervision served concurrently ;Felicia Mae Garlin: Initially charged as an adult, Felicia Garlin faced charges similar to the others. Under pressure from concerns that Garlin had been under duress following the murder of her mother by Clark and Clerc, the court transferred the 15-year-old to the juvenile division.

Compared to pre-crisis peaks: *House prices in Warsaw are down by 13.1% *In Krakow, house prices are down by 17.9% *In Poznan, house prices have fallen by 28% *In Gda≈Ñsk, house prices plunged by 27% *In Lodz, property prices plummeted by 35.7% The arguments for further real estate price rises or stabilization are: * a rapid increase of salaries - around 8% per year; * low figures of both housing estate area and apartments per person, compared to other developed countries worldwide; * money repatriated by Poles who have emigrated; * rapid urbanization - the population of rural areas and small towns is declining rapidly, while the population of major urban areas is increasing quickly; In addition, Warsaw has a population of only 2 million people ‚Äì approximately 5% of the whole of the country ‚Äì which is very low for a capital city.Property Investment Index By Country Retrieved on Nov.4, 2013 Poland is also one of many countries with a rather high house price to income ratio (13.58) and an estimated rental profitability between 3.92% to 4.31% for residential units.

They spoke a dialect distinct from, and not intelligible by, Siouan language speakers, the primary language family of the area (but, on the contrary, according to many opinions, more or less strictly related to Catawban Siouan). Unclassified language Early European observers and later American scholars thought the Congaree were likely of the Siouan language family, given their geographic location and characteristics of neighboring tribes. Since the late 20th century, scholars more widely agree that the people were non-Siouan. Their language was distinct from the Siouan language, and not intelligible to their immediate Siouan neighbors, the Wateree.James Hart Merrell, The Indians' New World: Catawbas and Their Neighbors from European Contact through the Era of Removal, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1989. p. 110 History The Congaree lived along the Santee and Congaree rivers, above and below the junction of the Wateree, in central South Carolina. They occupied territory between the Santee tribe below them and the Wateree tribe above. Native Americans sold as slaves members of other tribes captured in war or raids. By 1693, Congaree, Esaw and Savannah slave- catchers had pursued the Cherokee as \\"objects of the slave trade to the extent that a tribal delegation was sent\\" to Governor Thomas Smith. They sought protection, claiming that Cherokee had been sold in the Charles Town slave market. In 1698, the Congaree lost \\"most tribe members to smallpox.\\" The English explorer John Lawson encountered the survivors in 1701, apparently on the northeastern bank of the Santee River below the junction of the Wateree. Lawson described their village as consisting of about a dozen houses, located on a small creek flowing into Santee River. They were a small tribe, having lost heavily by tribal feuds, but more especially by smallpox, which had depopulated whole villages. But a 1715 map shows their village as located on the southern bank of the Congaree and considerably above the previous area, perhaps about Big Beaver creek, or about opposite the site of Columbia, on the eastern boundary of Lexington county. They may have been moving upriver to get further from English colonists. During the Tuscarora War of 1711, the Congaree fought on the side of English colonist John Barnwell, who raised a militia. In early 1715 John Barnwell took a census, which identified the Congaree as living in one village, with a total population of 22 men and 70 women and children. During the Yamasee War of 1715, the Congaree joined with other tribes in the fight against the colony of South Carolina. Over half were either killed or enslaved by the colonists and Cherokee; some were sent into slavery in the West Indies. Following that, surviving Congaree moved up the country and joined the Catawba, with whom they were still living in 1743. In 1718, Fort Congaree was established near the Congaree village, near today's Columbia. It became an important trading station and a European-American settlement formed around it. In the subsequent decades, Congaree survivors merged with the larger Catawba people. Different tribes lived in their own villages within the loose Catawba federation. The Congaree tribe maintained their distinction until the late 18th century, as they had a language different from the Siouan Catawba, but they are now extinct as a tribe. Based on colonial accounts, Mooney (1928) described the Congaree as: \\"A friendly people, handsome and well built, the women being especially beautiful compared with those of other tribes. Keyauwee Jack, a Congaree by birth, became chief of the Keyauwee by marriage.  Legacy  Congaree National Park and the Congaree River are named after the tribe. Some members of the present-day Catawba and other tribes of the Carolinas are likely genetic descendants of the Congaree, among others.

During the engagement, American paratroopers of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division held the town for two days against the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G√∂tz von Berlichingen. This action delayed the 17th SS Panzergrenadier's counterattack on Carentan, which was repulsed at the Battle of Bloody Gulch on June 13. After retaking Graignes, the German troops massacred 44 civilians and a number of prisoners of war taken in the capture of an American aid station, and set fire to the town. Landings and village assistance Shortly after 02:00 hours on D-Day, Tuesday, 6 June 1944, twelve planeloads of American paratroopers from the 3rd Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were scattered throughout the marshes south of Carentan. They were supposed to have been dropped 18 miles to the northwest at drop zone ‚ÄúT‚Äù near Amfreville, but instead ended-up in the vicinity of the French village of Graignes. Theirs was the worst mis-drop of any U.S. airborne unit on D-Day. By 1000 hours, twenty-five paratroopers under the command of 507th Captain Leroy D. Brummitt had gathered in the village. Two hours later, more 3rd Battalion/507th men arrived, led by Major Charles D. Johnston. Because the troopers were deep behind enemy lines and far from their drop zone, the decision was made to remain where they had landed and defend Graignes. As the Americans went to work preparing defensive positions, the mortar platoon dug in around the cemetery and sent a detachment to occupy the church belfry as an observation post. From that vantage point, the observer enjoyed an unobstructed view of the network of roads and trails leading to the village from the west and southwest. While these defenses were being prepared, Major Johnston established his command post at the boys‚Äô school. Throughout this digging-in process, more American paratroopers continued to arrive in Graignes, and by the end of the following day (D+1), the group had grown in size to 182 (12 officers and 170 enlisted men). Planned airborne drop zones on the Cotentin Peninsula, D-Day, 6 June 1944 On the morning of 6 June, the village‚Äôs mayor, M. (Monsieur) Mr. Alphonse Voydie, awoke to find American paratroopers in the field behind his house. He provided information and later called a town meeting to assess the supply situation. During that meeting, there was a unanimous decision to feed the paratroopers, despite the risks that came with helping the enemy. Under Mme (Madame) Mrs. Germaine Boursier's direction, the women of Graignes began cooking on a round the clock basis so they could serve two meals each day. Teams of men, women and even children were hauling wagon loads of valuable salvaged equipment back to the Graignes perimeter. Contact and assault In the afternoon on Saturday, 10 June, a mechanized patrol approached a defensive position that was manned by some of First Lieutenant Murn‚Äôs B Company, 1/501st Parachute Infantry Regiment men. They let the patrol get close, then opened fire, killing four. When the troopers searched a dead German‚Äôs pockets, they discovered some documents that revealed him to be assigned to a reconnaissance battalion of an armored division. On Sunday, there was no sign of the enemy and all was quiet that morning, so Major Johnston gave permission for some of the men to attend mass. However, half way through the service, a woman burst into the church yelling, ‚ÄúThe Germans are coming! Save yourselves!.\\" The first assault, which lasted only ten minutes, had been an uncoordinated, piecemeal effort. At about 1400 hours, the Germans commenced a punishing mortar bombardment of Graignes. This preparatory fire was swiftly followed by a second infantry assault against the flanks of the defensive line around the village. This time, the attackers moved so swiftly that the perimeter was almost breached at one point. However, Captain Brummitt quickly shifted forces to meet the threat, and the line held. Once again, the paratroopers‚Äô supporting fire was decisive in holding off defeat as mortar fire inflicted heavy losses and scores of enemy infantry were caught in the crossfire of the multiple machine guns defending the village center. In the evening, the guard posts could hear heavy vehicles move about. Since the observed evidence indicated that Graignes was about to be the target of a major attack, Major Johnston sent all of the civilians away. At about 1900 hours, two German 88 mm guns opened fire on Graignes from the heights of nearby Thieuville a few kilometers away. This quickly disorganized the Americans and killed Major Johnston. With the observation post in the belfry destroyed, it was no longer possible for the troopers to employ their mortars against the approaching enemy with any degree of effective accuracy. By the time the Germans made the final thrust into Graignes that night, the defenders had been reduced to a few isolated pockets of resistance spread out around the village. In many cases, men were beginning to run out of ammunition. As that happened, the enemy was quick to exploit the situation by overrunning the outer perimeter and moving into the streets of the center of the village. With Major Johnston dead, command of the force at Graignes fell to Captain Brummitt. Brummitt proceeded to order the men to pair off and try to make it to either Carentan or Sainte-M√®re-√âglise. Elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G√∂tz von Berlichingen had conducted the final assault on Graignes. When the 17th attacked, it was with a regimental sized force of approximately 2,000 men. The odds were ten-to-one in the Germans‚Äô favor. The 182 paratroopers defending Graignes inflicted an estimated one hundred killed and two hundred wounded on the Germans during the fighting on 10 and 11 June.  Waffen SS war crimes  At the end of the 11 June battle, the 17th SS entered the church and found Captain Abraham ‚ÄòBud‚Äô Sophian's aid station. Sophian (battalion surgeon and paratrooper) had surrendered the building to them by waving a white flag at the door. SS troops forced the Captain, his two medics and 14 wounded American paratroopers to line up against a wall. The captured Americans were by definition POWs and therefore should have been protected under the terms of the Geneva Convention of 1929, which Germany was a signatory to. In fact, the wounded Americans were divided into two groups and murdered. One group of five wounded was taken to the edge of a nearby pond, where SS troops bayoneted them and threw their bodies into the water. The other group of nine were forced to march at gunpoint, approximately four kilometers to the South, to a field near the village of Le Mesnil-Angot. After arriving at the field, the group were forced to dig a pit. After the hole had been dug, the SS shot each of the wounded men through the head and pushed their bodies into the pit.http://www.101airborneww2.com/lestweforget.html At some point that same day, Captain Sophian and his two medics were also killed by the SS. Collectively, these 17 murders perpetrated by Waffen SS troops against defenseless prisoners of war constituted war crimes. Other Germans began systematically rounding-up French civilians suspected of assisting US troops. A total of forty-four villagers were rounded up, interrogated by the Germans as suspected collaborators with the Americans and were then shot dead. Other SS men dragged Father Leblastier and Father Lebarbanchon from the rectory into the courtyard outside, and shot them both dead. The Germans then discovered Madeleine Pezeril and eighty-year-old Eug√©nie Dujardin and shot them both dead in their beds. Thereafter, the SS men ransacked the village for any valuables they could steal. On Tuesday 13 June, the Germans burned the village. They poured gasoline over the bodies of Father Leblastier, Father Lebarbanchon, Eug√©nie Dujardin and Madeleine Pezeril and then set them on fire. The ensuing blaze was allowed to burn out of control, destroying 66 homes, the boys‚Äô school, Mme Boursier‚Äôs caf√©, and the 12th-century church. Another 159 homes and other buildings were damaged either as a result of that fire or the fighting. Before the 11 June battle and the German retaliation that followed, the village of Graignes had consisted of just over two hundred dispersed homes and other structures. Afterward, only two houses survived unscathed. By then most of the Graignes defenders had already left. Small groups arrived in Carentan late at night on the 12 June. Other troopers, some alone and some in pairs, continued to filter in on the 13 and 14 June. Twenty- one men hidden by the Rigault family and taken to Carentan by Joseph Folliot on the night of 15 to 16 June were the last from Graignes to make it back to U.S. lines. One hundred fifty troopers out of the original 182 made it out alive. Aftermath Memorial to citizens of Graignes and American soldiersHad the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped dead the advance of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadiers this division could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. The 507th remained in the fight in Normandy until 15 July when it returned to England. The regiment, later reassigned to the 17th Airborne Division, then went on to fight in the Battle of the Bulge and Operation Varsity ‚Äì the airborne assault across the Rhine River. In September 1945, the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment returned to the United States and was disbanded. On 6 July 1986, a ceremony was held in the ruins of the 12th- century Roman Catholic church during which eleven villagers were presented with the Award for Distinguished Civilian Service for their role in assisting the men of 3/507th PIR. Six of those awards were posthumous. In popular culture DC Vertigo Comics will publish a graphic novel about the Battle of Graignes called Six Days: The Incredible True Story of D-Day's Lost Chapter. Robert Venditti and Kevin Maurer wrote Six Days (Venditti's uncle died during the battle). Andrea Mutti drew the cover and interior art.

If this can be done often enough, declarer eventually runs out of trumps and may lose control of the hand. A forcing defense is therefore applicable only to contracts played in a trump suit. The defense should try to make declarer ruff in the long trump hand. Unless declarer is playing for a dummy reversal, he usually intends to ruff losers in the short trump hand anyway. If the defense can shorten declarer's trumps sufficiently, it may wind up with more trumps than declarer. In that case, the defense will be able to pull any remaining trumps and run its own winners. A forcing defense is usually begun on the opening lead because the tempo is often important. It is indicated when: *The defense knows or suspects that the trump suit is breaking badly for declarer. *There is a side suit that declarer will have to ruff. *The defense has enough entries that it will be able to continue leading the side suit. The latter requirement means that the forcing defense is seldom attempted against voluntarily bid slams: the declaring side normally has so much strength that the defense's opportunities to continue to attack the trump suit are very limited. Example Alfred Sheinwold cites this example of a forcing defense to South's contract of 4: West leads the K. South takes the A and plans to win five spades, one heart, at least three diamonds and a club. He leads the K, West ducks, and East's club discard discloses the bad trump break. South has no better move than to continue spades, hoping for a defensive error, a winning diamond finesse, or that the hearts block. West ducks his A once again, though, and South now tries the diamond finesse. East wins the K and forces South with another heart. South ruffs and leads a club to the A. East leads another heart and again South has to ruff. By now, South is down to two trumps and West still has two, including the A. When South leads another trump, West takes the A and a heart lead forces out South's last trump. At the end, West will make his small trump, winning in all two spades, a diamond and a club. Notice what happens if South continues trumps at trick 4. West takes his A and continues hearts, forcing South to ruff. South has now lost control of the hand. No matter how South continues, the defense continues to force South with heart leads after taking the K and the A, again winning two spades, a diamond and a club, or a trick in each suit. Notice also that West must wait for the third round of spades to take his A, after which dummy is out of trumps. If he takes his A on either the first or second round of trumps, South can play on the minor suits and ruff a fourth round of hearts in dummy. This would let South preserve trump control, draw West's small trumps, and hold E-W to one trump trick only.

In 1989, the museum initiated a planning process to address the growing community need for its programs. The result was the decision to create a more expansive and centrally located facility with increased exhibitions, an area dedicated to education, and added program areas including live music, theater, dance, literary events, and film. In June 2008, the museum opened a new 63,000 square-foot facility in downtown San Francisco.  Exhibitions The museum has no permanent collection. It curates and hosts a broad array of exhibitions each year in collaboration with other institutions.  Programs  The museum's education programs include public tours, classes and workshops, film screenings, lectures and gallery talks, performances, teacher training, school visits, family tours and art making, and a teen internship program. Yud\\"  Architecture  The museum's main building is the former Pacific Gas & Electric Jessie Street Substation, which was originally built in 1881 and was rebuilt in 1907 by Willis Polk after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 6, 1974. Daniel Libeskind designed the new 63,000 square foot (5,900 square meter) interior of the substation, plus a new deconstructivist cubical addition which extends it. The new museum was completed in 2008 at the cost of $47.5 million. The deconstructivist addition by Daniel Libeskind (2017) The building's tilted, dark-blue stainless steel cube, constructed by A. Zahner Company,Hamlin, Jesse (May 6, 2007) \\"Jewish Museum Blanketed in Blue\\" San Francisco Chronicle slices into the old substation's brick, making visible the relationship between the new and the old. Libeskind's design preserves the defining features of Polk's old building, including its brick fa√ßade, trusses, and skylights. 36 diamond- shaped windows light the top floor of the metal cube, known as the \\"Yud\\", which hosts sound and performance based exhibitions. The museum's other section, a slanting rectangle known as the \\"Chet\\", holds the narrow lobby, an education center, and part of an upstairs gallery. Similar to Libeskind's Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen, the Contemporary Jewish Museum incorporates text into its design. Inspired by the phrase \\"L‚Äôchaim\\", meaning \\"To Life\\", Libeskind let the Hebrew letters that spell \\"chai\\" ‚Äî\\"chet\\" and \\"yud\\", inspire the form of the building. Libeskind himself explains how he used the letters: \\"The chet provides an overall continuity for the exhibition and educational spaces, and the yud with its 36 windows, serves as special exhibition, performance and event space.\\" \\"To Life\\", also a traditional Jewish drinking toast, refers both \\"to the role the substation played in restoring energy to the city after the 1906 earthquake and the Museum's mission to be a lively center for engaging audiences with Jewish culture.\\" The Hebrew word pardes, meaning \\"orchard\\", is embedded in the wall of the lobby. The building also houses a multi-purpose event space, an auditorium, Wise Sons Deli, and a museum store. =Reaction= Critic Christopher Hawthorne of the Los Angeles Times praised Libeskind for a \\"careful balance of explosive and well-behaved forms\\" and gallery designs that abandon the architect's characteristic slanted walls. Likewise, David D‚ÄôArcy of the Wall Street Journal sees the museum as a laudable departure from Libeskind's previous work. He finds a \\"lightness to this [museum] that is rare in the architect‚Äôs work\\" and that \\"relieves the surrounding district‚Äôs glass and steel tourist-mall monotony.\\" Management Former Whitney Museum curator Connie Wolf was the museum's director from 1999 to 2012. Lori Starr, former executive director of the Koffler Centre of the Arts in Toronto, Ontario, Canada was appointed the museum's director in 2013. In 2014, the museum hired Renny Pritikin as Chief Curator. In 2015, the museum hired Anastasia Rygle as Associate Curator.

He was also, being the son of Grand Duke Alexei, a grandson of Alexander II of Russia. Birth Alexei Alexeevich was born to Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia, the son of Czar Alexander II of Russia, and Alexandra Vasilievna Zhukovskaya, daughter of famous Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky. Controversy It is still rumoured that Alexei's parents married, however that has never been proven. But even if they were married, the marriage was morganatic, because Alexandra was born a \\"commoner,\\" and not of a royal or formerly sovereign family. When Alexei was born in Salzburg, he was known by his mother's family name. While his father tried to get a Russian title for his son, the Emperor Alexander II refused. However he managed to get a title for mother and son from the Republic of San Marino: on 24. March 1875 they were granted the title Baron Seggiano. Alexandra married the same year the Baron Christian-Henrich von Wohrmann. This might be taken as an indication that there was no marriage to the Grand Duke as she could have done so only after a divorce. No records exist of such a divorce. Only after Alexander II had been murdered and Alexander III had become Emperor, the Grand Duke succeed to have his son created a Count. The title granted was on 21. March 1884 was Count Belevsky. The name was chosen from the village of Belyov in the province of Toula where his grandfather poet was born. In 1913 he was granted the right to add his grandfather's family name to his title just becoming Count Belevsky-Zhukovsky. Marriage Count Alexei married, on 29 August 1894 in , Princess Maria Petrovna Troubetskaya (18 June 1872 Russia ‚Äì 20 March 1954 Paris), the daughter of Prince Petr Troubetskoy. As Ilyinskoye was the property of his uncle the Grand Duke Serge, Governor of Moscow, it can be taken as a sign that he was quite accepted in Imperial circles (and he served as Serge's orderly since 1904). The marriage did not last and Alexis remarried. His second wife was Baronne Natalia von Schoeppingk. Children Count Alexei and Princess Maria had four children: * Countess Elizabeta Alexeevna Belevskya-Zhukovskya (8 September 1896 Moscow ‚Äì 30 July 1975 New Jersey) married Petr Ghika-Perevostchikov (1872‚Äì1937) and had two children. * Countess Alexandra Alexeevna Belevskya-Zhukovskya (b. 4 March 1899 Moscow ‚Äì 1995) married twice and had no children. * Countess Mariya Alexeevna Belevskya-Zhukovskya (b. 26 October 1901 Moscow - 18 August 1996 Cormeilles-en-Parisis) married in 1922 Wladimir Sverbeev (1892‚Äì1951) and had one daughter. * Count Sergei Alexeevich Belevsky-Zhukovsky (17 February 1903 Moscow ‚Äì 27 November 1956 Los Angeles) married in 1926 Nina Botkine (1901‚Äì1966) and had one daughter Helene.

It originated from Arabic m≈´miyƒÅ \\"a type of resinous bitumen found in Western Asia and used curatively\\" in traditional Islamic medicine, which was translated as pissasphaltus (from \\"pitch\\" and \\"asphalt\\") in ancient Greek medicine. In medieval European medicine, m≈´miyƒÅ \\"bitumen\\" was transliterated into Latin as mumia meaning both \\"a bituminous medicine from Persia\\" and \\"mummy\\". Merchants in apothecaries dispensed expensive mummia bitumen, which was thought to be an effective cure-all for many ailments. It was also used as an aphrodisiac. Beginning around the 12th century when supplies of imported natural bitumen ran short, mummia was misinterpreted as \\"mummy\\", and the word's meaning expanded to \\"a black resinous exudate scraped out from embalmed Egyptian mummies\\". This began a period of lucrative trade between Egypt and Europe, and suppliers substituted rare mummia exudate with entire mummies, either embalmed or desiccated. After Egypt banned the shipment of mummia in the 16th century, unscrupulous European apothecaries began to sell fraudulent mummia prepared by embalming and desiccating fresh corpses. During the Renaissance, scholars proved that translating bituminous mummia as mummy was a mistake, and physicians stopped prescribing the ineffective drug. Lastly, artists in the 17‚Äì19th centuries used ground up mummies to tint a popular oil- paint called mummy brown. Terminology The etymologies of both English mummia and mummy derive from Medieval Latin mumia, which transcribes Arabic m≈´miyƒÅ \\"a kind of bitumen used medicinally; a bitumen-embalmed body\\" from m≈´m \\"wax (used in embalming)\\", which descend from Persian mumiya and mum.Online Etymology Dictionary, mummy.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, mummy. The Oxford English Dictionary records the complex semantic history of mummy and mummia. Mummy was first recorded meaning \\"a medicinal preparation of the substance of mummies; hence, an unctuous liquid or gum used medicinally\\" (c. 1400), which Shakespeare used jocularly for \\"dead flesh; body in which life is extinct\\" (1598), and later \\"a pulpy substance or mass\\" (1601). Second, it was semantically extended to mean \\"a sovereign remedy\\" (1598), \\"a medicinal bituminous drug obtained from Arabia and the East\\" (1601), \\"a kind of wax used in the transplanting and grafting of trees\\" (1721), and \\"a rich brown bituminous pigment\\" (1854). The third mummy meaning was \\"the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial\\" (1615), and \\"a human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air\\" (1727). Mummia was originally used in mummy's first meaning \\"a medicinal preparation‚Ä¶\\" (1486), then in the second meaning \\"a sovereign remedy\\" (1741), and lastly to specify \\"in mineralogy, a sort of bitumen, or mineral pitch, which is soft and tough, like shoemaker's wax, when the weather is warm, but brittle, like pitch, in cold weather. It is found in Persia, where it is highly valued\\" (1841). In modern English usage, mummy commonly means \\"embalmed body\\" as distinguished from mummia \\"a medicine\\" in historical contexts. Mummia or mumia is defined by three English mineralogical terms.All definitions are from the OED (2016). Bitumen (from Latin bit≈´men) originally meant \\"a kind of mineral pitch found in Palestine and Babylon, used as mortar, etc. The same as asphalt, mineral pitch, Jew's pitch, Bitumen judaicum\\", and in modern scientific use means \\"the generic name of certain mineral inflammable substances, native hydrocarbons more or less oxygenated, liquid, semi-solid, and solid, including naphtha, petroleum, asphalt, etc.\\" Asphalt (from Ancient Greek √°sphaltos \\"asphalt, bitumen‚Äù) first meant \\"A bituminous substance, found in many parts of the world, a smooth, hard, brittle, black or brownish-black resinous mineral, consisting of a mixture of different hydrocarbons; called also mineral pitch, Jews' pitch, and in the [Old Testament] 'slime'\\", and presently means \\"A composition made by mixing bitumen, pitch, and sand, or manufactured from natural bituminous limestones, used to pave streets and walks, to line cisterns, etc.\\", used as an abbreviation for asphalt concrete. Until the 20th century, the Latinate term asphaltum was also used. Pissasphalt (from Greek pissasphaltus \\"pitch\\" and \\"asphalt\\") names \\"A semi-liquid variety of bitumen, mentioned by ancient writers\\". The medicinal use of bituminous mummia has a parallel in Ayurveda: shilajit or silajit (from Sanskrit shilajatu \\"rock- conqueror\\") or mumijo (from Persian m≈´miyƒÅ \\"wax\\") is \\"A name given to various solid or viscous substances found on rock in India and Nepal ‚Ä¶ esp. a usu. dark-brown odoriferous substance which is used in traditional Indian medicine and probably consists principally of dried animal urine\\". History The usage of mumiya as medicine began with the famous Persian mumiya black pissasphalt remedy for wounds and fractures, which was confused with similarly appearing black bituminous materials used in Egyptian mummification. This was misinterpreted by Medieval Latin translators to mean whole mummies. Starting in the 12th century and continuing until as far as the 19th century, mummies and bitumen from mummies would be central in European medicine and art, as well as Egyptian trade.Karl H. Dannenfeldt (1985), \\"Egyptian Mumia: The Sixteenth Century Experience and Debate\\", The Sixteenth Century Journal 16.2: 163. Bitumen or asphalt had many uses in the ancient world such as glue, mortar, and waterproofing. The ancient Egyptians began to use bitumen for embalming mummies during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991‚Äì1802 BCE).Abraham, Herbert (1938), Asphalts and Allied Substances: Their Occurrence, Modes of Production, Uses in the Arts, and Methods of Testing, D. Van Nostrand Co.S. G. F. Brandon, \\"Mummification.\\" Man, Myth and Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural. According to historians of pharmacy, mummia became part of the materia medica of the Arabs, discussed by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (845‚Äì925) and Ibn al-Baitar (1197‚Äì1248).Needham, Joseph and Lu Gwei-djen (1974), Science and Civilization in China. Vol. 5., Part 2. Chemistry and Chemical Technology. Part II. Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality, Cambridge University Press, 75. Medieval Persian physicians used bitumen/asphalt both as a salve for cuts, bruises, and bone fractures, and as an internal medicine for stomach ulcers and tuberculosis. They achieved the best results with a black pissasphalt that seeped from a mountain in Darabgerd, Persia.Pringle, Heather Anne (2001), The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead, Barnes & Noble, 196. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides' c. 50‚Äì70 De Materia Medica ranked bitumen from the Dead Sea as medicinally superior to the pissasphalt from Apollonia (Illyria), both of which were considered to be an equivalent substitute for the scarce and expensive Persian mumiya.Dannenfeldt (1985), 164. During the Crusades, European soldiers learned firsthand of the drug mummia, which was considered to have great healing powers in cases of fracture and rupture.Pringle (2001), 196. The demand for mummia increased in Europe and since the supply of natural bitumen from Persia and the Dead Sea was limited, the search for a new source turned to the tombs of Egypt. Misinterpreting the Latin word mumia \\"medicinal bitumen\\" involved several steps. The first was to substitute substances exuded by Egyptian mummies for the natural product.Dannenfeldt, Karl H. (1959), \\"Egypt and Egyptian Antiquities in the Renaissance\\", Studies in the Renaissance 6: 17. The Arab physician Serapion the Younger (fl. 12th century) wrote about bituminous mumia and its many uses, but the Latin translation of Simon Geneunsis (d. 1303) said, \\"Mumia, this is the mumia of the sepulchers with aloes and myrrh mixed with the liquid (humiditate) of the human body\\".Dannenfeldt (1985), 165. Two 12th century Italian examples: Gerard of Cremona, mistakenly translated Arabic mumiya as \\"the substance found in the land where bodies are buried with aloes by which the liquid of the dead, mixed with the aloes, is transformed and it is similar to marine pitch\\",Pringle (2001), 197. and the physician Matthaeus Platearius said \\"Mumia is a spice found in the sepulchers of the dead.... That is best which is black, ill-smelling, shiny, and massive\\".Dannenfeldt (1985), 164. The second step was to confuse and replace the rare black exudation from embalmed corpses with the black bitumen that Egyptians used as an embalming preservative. The Baghdad physician Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (1162‚Äì1231) described ancient Egyptian mummies, \\"In the belly and skull of these corpses is also found in great abundance called mummy\\", added that although the word properly denoted bitumen or asphalt, \\"The mummy found in the hollows of the corpses in Egypt, differs but immaterially from the nature of mineral mummy; and where any difficulty arises in procuring the latter, may be substituted in its stead.\\" Dannenfeldt (1985), 166. The third step in misinterpreting mummia was to substitute the blackened flesh of an entire mummy for the hardened bituminous materials from the interior cavities of the cadavers.Dannenfeldt (1985), 167. The ancient tombs of Egypt and the deserts could not meet the European demand for the drug mumia, so a commerce developed in the manufacture and sale of fraudulent mummies, sometimes called mumia falsa. The Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo (1450‚Äì1525) defined mumia as \\"The flesh of a dead body that is embalmed, and it is hot and dry in the second [grade], and therefore it has virtue to incarne [i.e., heal over] wounds and to staunch blood\\", and included it in his list of essential drugs.Dannenfeldt (1985), 170‚Äì171. The Swiss-German polymath Paracelsus (1493‚Äì1541) gave mummia a new meaning of \\"intrinsic spirit\\" and said true pharmaceutical mummia must be \\"the body of a man who did not die a natural death but rather died an unnatural death with a healthy body and without sickness\\". The German physician Oswald Croll (1563‚Äì1609) said mumia was \\"not the liquid matter which is found in the Egyptian sepulchers,\\" but rather \\"the flesh of a man that perishes a violent death, and kept for some time in the air\\", and gave a detailed recipe for making tincture of mumia from the corpse of a young red-haired man, who had been hanged, bludgeoned on the breaking wheel, exposed to the air for days, then cut into small pieces, sprinkled with powdered myrrh and aloes, soaked in wine, and dried.Dannenfeldt (1985), 173‚Äì174. Renaissance scholars and physicians first expressed opposition to using human mumia in the 16th century. The French naturalist Pierre Belon (1517‚Äì1564) concluded that the Arab physicians, from whom the western writers derived their knowledge of mumia, had actually referred to the pissasphalt of Dioscorides, which had been misconstrued by the translators. He said Europeans were importing both the \\"falsely called\\" mumia obtained from the scraping the bodies of cadavers, and \\"artificial mumia\\" made by exposing buried dead bodies to the heat of the sun before grinding them up. While he considered the available mumia to be a valueless and even dangerous drug, he noted that King Francis I always carried with him a mixture of mumia and rhubarb to use as an immediate remedy for any injury.Dannenfeldt (1985), 174‚Äì175. The barber surgeon Ambroise Par√© (d. 1590) revealed the manufacture of fake mummia both in France, where apothecaries would steal the bodies of executed criminals, dry them in an oven, and sell the flesh; and in Egypt, where a merchant, who admitted collecting dead bodies and preparing mummia, expressed surprise that the Christians, \\"so dainty- mouthed, could eat the bodies of the dead\\".Dannenfeldt (1959), 18‚Äì19. Par√© admitted to having personally administered mumia a hundred times, but condemned \\"this wicked kinde of Drugge, doth nothing helpe the diseased,\\" and so he stopped prescribing it and encouraged others not to use mumia.Dannenfeldt (1985), 176‚Äì177. The English herbalist John Gerard's 1597 Herball described the ancient Egyptians using cedar pitch for embalming, and noted that the preserved bodies that shopkeepers falsely call \\"mumia\\" should be what the Greeks called pissasphalton. Gerard blamed the error on the translator of Serapion who interpreted mumia \\"according to his own fancie\\" that it is the exudate from an embalmed human corpse.Dannenfeldt (1985), 177. The medical use of Egyptian mumia continued through the 17th century. The physicist Robert Boyle (1627‚Äì1691) praised it as \\"one of the useful medicines commended and given by our physicians for falls and bruises, and in other cases too.\\" The Dutch physician Steven Blankaart's 1754 Lexicon medicum renovatum listed four types of mumia: Arabian exudate from bodies embalmed with spices and asphalt, Egyptian bodies embalmed with pissasphalt, sun-dried bodies found in the desert, the natural pissasphalt.Dannenfeldt (1985), 178. Mummia's familiarity as a remedy in Britain is demonstrated by passing references in Shakespeare, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, and John Donne, and also by more detailed remarks in the writings of Thomas Browne, Francis Bacon, and Robert Boyle.Daly, Nicholas (1994), \\"That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy\\", Novel: A Forum on Fiction 28.1: 25. By the 18th century, skepticism about the pharmaceutical value of mumia was increasing, and medical opinion was turning against its use. The English medical writer John Quincy wrote in 1718 that although mumia was still listed in medicinal catalogues, \\"it is quite out of use in Prescription\\".Dannenfeldt (1985), 178. Mummia was offered for sale medicinally as late as 1924 in the price list of Merck & Co..http://www.magazine.emerck/darmstadt_germany/culture/mummies/powdered_mummies_used_as_medicine.html Both mummia and asphalt have long been used as pigments. The British chemist and painter Arthur Herbert Church described the use of mummia for making \\"mummy brown\\" oil paint: > 'Mummy,' as a pigment, is inferior to prepared, but superior to raw, > asphalt, inasmuch as it has been submitted to a considerable degree of heat, > and has thereby lost some of its volatile hydrocarbons. Moreover, it is > usual to grind up the bones and other parts of the mummy together, so that > the resulting powder has more solidity and is less fusible than the asphalt > alone would be. A London colourman informs me that one Egyptian mummy > furnishes sufficient material to satisfy the demands of his customers for > twenty years. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that some samples of > the pigment sold as 'mummy' are spurious.Arthur H. Church (1901), The > Chemistry of Paints and Painting, 236. The modern pigment sold as \\"mummy brown\\" is composed of a mixture of kaolin, quartz, goethite and hematite.

It debuted on October 7, 2006 and ran until September 29, 2007, replacing for that period of time the Ohio Lottery's Cash Explosion Double Play series. Eligibility For a chance to appear on the show, a player aged 18 years or older had to have bought a special Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich scratchcard instant ticket for the show. These were available in two formats; a standard single-game ticket costing $1 to play, or a larger $2 ticket with a second, separate gameboard. These tickets replaced the Cash Explosion scratchers for the duration of the series. All remaining Cash Explosion \\"ENTRY\\" winners sent in within 180 days of that game's official withdrawal were also eligible for the new show. On either the $1 or $2 ticket, matching three special symbols qualified the player for an appearance on the game show, once the ticket was mailed to the address provided. Of all valid entry tickets received, 30 of them were randomly selected to appear as contestants on the show. If a contestant played on a $2 ticket instead of a $1 ticket, they became an \\"Extended Play\\" contestant and were entitled to special bonuses throughout the show (see below). Format =Semi-final Game= Five teams of three competed. One team was randomly picked, and the three players voted on whether they wanted the amount on the Safe table or Risk table, with majority ruling. Each table had 20 amounts; the Safe table had lower cash values, whereas the Risk table had higher values but also values worth nothing. The players then started a randomizer, which spun up two values, one from each table. The team won the amount corresponding to the table they chose. Both values were then removed from play, and another team was selected at random from those remaining. Some values on each board were marked with an \\"Extended Play\\" ribbon. If these amounts were won, any Extended Play players on the team won an additional $750 (originally $500), not added to the overall team score. After each team played one turn, the boards were reset with higher values, as well as more $0 spaces on the Risk table. After each team had three turns, the team in the lead won and all three teammates advanced to the Championship Game. Hitting the $30,000 value (the highest available) on a team's third turn was an instant mathematical win for the team, though play continued until all five teams completed their third turn. All teams divided their shared winnings equally. If a team's total was less than $3,000, it was increased to that amount. Two semi-final games were played with different teams for each game. After the first few weeks of the show, each team's first turn was played prior to taping to speed up the game. Thereafter, the semi-final games were joined in progress as the second round of turns were about to start. =Championship Game= The six remaining players (the two winning teams in the Semi-Final games, now playing individually) were moved to podiums. Six numbered cards were presented, and each player picked one either from the top of the deck or \\"stole\\" an already-selected card from another player (who was then forced to pick another card from the deck). One of the cards allowed the holder to move on to the Face-Off Game, and another had a $5,000 bonus. However, taking the $5,000 payout forced the player to leave the game. The other four simply said \\"Bye\\" and eliminated the player. After all six players selected their card, the player with the $5,000 card was revealed. They were given the choice to quit with the money or trade with someone else. Following this, three players holding \\"bye\\" cards were then revealed. The last two remaining players were then given the chance to swap cards or keep them. Afterward, the person holding the winning card was revealed. That person won $10,000 and advanced to the Face-Off. For the first several weeks, there was an additional step following the reveal of the $5,000 card. Each player, in turn, was asked if he or she wanted to hold onto the card he or she currently held, or if they wished to trade with a randomly selected opponent, including the holder of the $5,000. After all six players had made this decision, whoever was left with the $5,000 card was given the option to retire from play or trade cards, and gameplay continued as described above. =Face-Off Game= The winning contestant faced off against the champion from the last show. The final round involved ten balls in a concealed cylinder: seven red, two white, and one green. The champion decided whether they want to draw first or not, and then the contestants took turns drawing balls from the cylinder. Red balls did not affect gameplay and were discarded when drawn. White balls won the player $50,000 and the right to come back the following week to defend their title. Green balls were also worth $50,000 and the right to return the following week when drawn, but if the player who drew that ball was an Extended Play contestant, they also won the \\"Extended Play Jackpot\\". The Jackpot started at $0 and increased by $5,000 every time an Extended Play contestant won the Face-Off with a white ball and $2,500 every time the player holding the $5,000 card in the championship game traded it away. The Jackpot reset to $0 once it was won. Champions played until defeated.

It is situated off of Route 340, which runs from Lewisporte to Twillingate island, aptly named \\"Road to the Isles\\". A bay separates Baytona from a neighboring town called Birchy Bay. The first settlers of Baytona were fishermen, with women mainly staying home to raise children; however, with a depletion in cod stocks and lobsters, there was a shift away from the fishing industry. Currently, the majority of people living in Baytona made a living from the forestry industry. However, with the shutdown of Abitibi and the Grand Falls newsprint mill, many are left in hard economic situations. According to the 2006 census there are 276 residents, with a 15.1% population loss between 2001 and 2006 Baytona has a fire department, town council and a recreation committee. There is currently one running convenience store. The community has a playground, and a basketball court. The town also has an Anglican and a Pentecostal church. Name change Originally, Baytona was known as \\"Birchy Bay North\\". In 1958 the name was changed to \\"Gayside\\" to help the flow of mail delivery. The name was a play on the word \\"gay\\", which at that time meant happy, implying that Gayside was the more pleasant of the two communities. However, in 1985, due to a change in definition of the word \\"gay\\", and subsequent joking and harassment of neighbouring communities, the name of the town was, once again, changed from \\"Gayside\\" to \\"Baytona\\".The History Of Baytona References Category:Towns in Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Baytona"},{"id":"11888344","text":"The (SEV or Spanish Society of Vexillology) is an association devoted to the study of flags.

Currently (March 2015) there are eight novels in the series and one collection of short stories. The books are set in a star system far from our own, where various Celtic peoples emigrated after the rise of Christianity and the purge of the Old Religion that followed. The novels and short stories are based upon traditional Celtic legends and mythology, woven into a technologically advanced universe, and updated for a futuristic culture. Several other titles were planned, but when publisher HarperCollins decided to drop the series, despite much fan support and outcry, Kennealy-Morrison was forced to curtail it. The author has recently made known her plans to continue the series with at least two more titles, The Beltane Queen, and The Cloak of Gold, the conclusion of the series, to be published by her own Lizard Queen Press, and, depending on reader response, possibly several more.Kennealy- Morrison, Patricia (2007) Return to Keltia and Other Places (accessed May 21, 2007)Kennealy-Morrison, Patricia (June 21, 2007) Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead - The Rennie Stride Mysteries (accessed July 3, 2007) The Tales of Aeron =The Copper Crown= The Copper Crown introduces us to the technologically advanced, interstellar kingdom of Keltia, founded in Earth year 452 by Celts from Earth. As the book opens, in Earth year 3512, Aeron Aoibhell is Ard-rian (High Queen) of Keltia, and finds herself in a particularly unenviable position. Earth has finally discovered its faraway and long-sundered kinfolk, but any possible alliance/treaty with the Terran Federacy could result in war with Keltia‚Äôs fiercest rivals, the Phalanx and the Cabiri Empire. Facing these ethical dilemmas proves challenging for the queen and her realm. (Published as Patricia Kennealy; hardcover 1984; paperback 1986) =The Throne of Scone= The Throne of Scone continues directly on from the action of The Copper Crown. Aeron finds some unlikely friends and allies on her quest for the long-lost Thirteen Treasures of Keltia, and for the Once and Future King himself, Arthur of Arvon. As in The Copper Crown, Aeron is once again faced with the challenge of liberating her kingdom and her people without giving in to the call of unlawful magic. (Patricia Kennealy; hc 1986; pb 1987) =The Silver Branch= The Silver Branch, the prequel to The Copper Crown, begins with Aeron‚Äôs father, King Fionnbarr, whose accidental love-affair affects both Keltia and Fomor, and continues with Aeron as she grows up: her education as a Fian (warrior) and a Ban-draoi (female druid); the personal and political challenges she must face before the arrival of the Terrans in Keltia; how she came by her great skills as warrior and sorceress; her strong friendship with Morwen Douglas, along with her love affairs with both Roderick Douglas (Morwen's elder brother) and Gwydion, Prince of Gwynedd; and why a mostly one- sided love/hate relationship with Arianiera (Gwydion's twin sister) ultimately causes Keltia's downfall. It also reveals why she fears her own powers, and why Bres, King of Fomor follows an obsessive compulsion to revenge himself for an act committed over 30 years prior. (Patricia Kennealy; hc 1988; pb 1989) The Tales of Arthur This trilogy is told in the first person. \\"The greatest bard of all time,\\" Taliesin Glyndour, narrates. =The Hawk's Gray Feather= In The Hawk‚Äôs Gray Feather Taliesin recounts his youth on the planet Gwynedd, and the beginnings of his lifelong friendship with Arthur of Arvon, destined to be the greatest king in both Keltic (and later Earth) history (at least until his descendant Aeron comes along 1500 years later). At this time, right around the present-day in Earthtime, the throne of Keltia has been usurped by the evil wizard known as the Marbh-draoi, and all Kelts suffer under his rule. All hope is not lost, however, as the rebellion known as the Counterinsurgency fights to put the true monarch back on the Throne of Scone. (Patricia Kennealy; (hc 1990; pb 1991) Arthur and Talyn somehow manage to be kept safe from the Marbh-Draoi Ederyn by the legendary Merlyn Llywd. They barely escape the destruction of both their home cities in attempts to destroy them before they can grow to adulthood and challenge the Marbh-draoi's hold on Keltia. =The Oak Above the Kings= The Oak above the Kings continues from the previous book, telling how the rightful ruler is restored, but now other threats rear their heads, including a few enemies of the most dangerous sort - those reared out of heart‚Äôs blood. Taliesin and Arthur have both married by now, and their choices of mate are fateful for Keltia as well for them personally. (Published as Patricia Kennealy-Morrison; hc 1994; pb 1995) =The Hedge of Mist= The Hedge of Mist concludes the Arthurian trilogy with a unique Grail quest and an epic battle to reclaim the soul of Keltia. Marguessan, Arthur‚Äôs evil sister, attempts to seize the Throne of Scone, while Morgan Magistra, her twin, wife of Taliesin and the mightiest sorceress Keltia will ever see, struggles to restore the balance of Darkness and Light. (Patricia Kennealy-Morrison; hc 1996; pb 1997) Stand-alone novels of The Keltiad =Blackmantle= Blackmantle is the story of Athyn Cahanagh, who, by prowess in battle and the acclamation of the people, rose from humble origins to be High Queen of Keltia. It is a tale of how will and love can transcend the bonds of death itself. When her husband and king, the legendary bard Morric Douglas, is torn from her by deception and slain by treachery, Athyn rides out, first to seek vengeance from those who betrayed Morric to his death, and then, with the assistance of the Sidhe lord Allyn, on to the Otherworld of Annwn to try to wrest her beloved back to her side from Arawn himself, the god who is lord of death and fate. As in the tales of Aeron, there is the central question of whether having the ability to change fate means it is an acceptable action to attempt, and what the penalties for such karmic upheavals may be. (Patricia Kennealy-Morrison; hc 1997; pb 1998) =The Deer's Cry= The Deer‚Äôs Cry is the story of the founding of Keltia. In fifth- century Ireland, Brendan Aoibhell is the son of a Sidhe princess and a mortal chieftain. When his heritage, his religion and his culture are all threatened by the onset of the ‚ÄúNew Religion‚Äù, Christianity, brought to his homeland by the fanatic missionary monk Padraic, he and those like him seek shelter in a faraway home that only one among them, the last survivor of Atlantis, has seen before - a home among the stars, which will be known as Keltia. (Patricia Kennealy-Morrison; hc 1998; pb 1999) Their new home is found largely in part by the magic of Brendan's mother, Nia the Golden, princess of the Sidhe. On the journey to find their new home, the future Kelts meet other space-faring races, some to be friends and some to be enemies of the future Keltic Six Nations. Short Story Collection =Tales of Spiral Castle: Stories of the Keltiad= Four short stories, taking place mostly in the time frame of the Aeron books. The Last Voyage: a crossover between the Keltiad and the Knights Templar. Taking place in the year 1307, this story recounts a fictional rescue and disappearance of the Templar fleet, long a tantalizing and mysterious conundrum, by a Keltic starship that happens to be in the neighborhood. Sir James Douglas, the historical \\"Black Douglas\\", is posited to be a Templar and taken aboard the starship. There he meets the captain, Connla mac Nessa, and is informed of the existence of Keltia, and he and his men must decide whether to take the captain's offer of sanctuary there or to remain on Earth. This story also appeared in Katherine Kurtz's 2002 anthology, Crusade of Fire, stories about the Knights Templar. Touchstone: Aeron Aoibhell as a child, being tested for magic, and what comes of it. The story introduces Gwyn ap Neith, king of the Sidhefolk, and his wife Etain, as important and recurring characters. Alembic: Gwydion Prince of Gwynedd, as a youth studying to be a Druid, and his own testing in the labyrinth of Glaston Tor. Gwyn and Etain appear here as well. Crucible: Terran lieutenant and explorer Sarah O'Reilly arrives in Keltia with the Earth ship Sword, just prior to the action of The Copper Crown. She quickly falls in love with all things Keltic, and has an encounter of her own with Gwyn and Etain. Varietum The author's legal name is \\"Patricia Kennealy Morrison\\".

It is situated just outside the Rotorua CBD at the intersection of Old Taupo Road and Pukuatua Street in Rotorua, New Zealand. History Rotorua Boys' High School had its beginnings as the Rotorua High and Grammar School, founded in 1927 to replace the earlier Rotorua District High School (1914‚Äì1926). By 1956 it had a roll in excess of 1200 students. The Intermediate Department was closed when Rotorua Intermediate School was established in 1957. The Rotorua High School was further split to make room for a growing population of the district and its educational needs when, in 1959 Rotorua Girls' High School was opened. Rotorua High School was then established as Rotorua Boys' High School and commenced to function as a state secondary school for boys with a roll of 640 pupils in February 1959.Rotorua High and Grammar School, Rotorua Boys' High School History and Register of Pupils by Kevin J Lyall = Principals = ;Rotorua District High School * John Warn (1914‚Äì1915) * Francis Wood (1915‚Äì1919) * Thomas Tanner (1916-1918) (While Wood was serving in World War I) * William Lewins (1920‚Äì1926) * George Barber (1926) ;Rotorua High and Grammar School * Aby Ryder (1927‚Äì1931) * Bill Harwood (1932‚Äì1959) ;Rotorua Boys' High School * Neville Thornton (1960‚Äì1962) * Ted Hamill (1963‚Äì1979) * Geoffrey Cramond (1980‚Äì1991) * Chris Grinter (1991 ‚Äì present) A book about Rotorua Boys' High School's history was published in 2007 and can be bought in bookstores around Rotorua.

The facility is designed to accommodate 104 students which represents over 10 percent of the school roll. The Ministry of Education appointed a limited statutory manager late in 2009 to investigate alleged mismanagement, inappropriate drug-testing and financial issues regarding the school hostel.Daily Post. \\"Manager appointed to Rotorua Boys' High\\".Daily Post Rotorua, 4 February 2010. Retrieved on 2010-07-07. In June 2010 the limited statutory manager reported that, following his investigation, he had found that the school had no case to answer. Families whose children have been excluded from the school's Tai Mitchell Hostel complained about unfair treatment. They believed their sons were targeted for inappropriate drug test procedures and inappropriate action taken after drug tests were performed. The statutory manager appointed by the Ministry of Education to look into the school's procedures, Dennis Finn, told The Daily Post he has cleared Mr Grinter and Mr Whata and had full confidence in them. Mr Finn said the report and its findings were only a small part of the bigger picture. The real issue was the serious breach by students of the rules of the school or hostels, he said. \\"Drugs; whether use of, in possession of, or supply of, will not be tolerated or accepted.\\" Mr Finn told The Daily Post he held a meeting between the mother and Mr Grinter and believed the issue had been resolved. The boys had since been reinstated at the school.

Trevi√±o School of Communications and Fine Arts is a fine arts and communications high school in Laredo, Texas, founded in 1993 by Vidal M. Trevi√±o, the LISD superintendent and a former member of the Texas House of Representatives. High school students from all three of the Laredo Independent School District high schools - Cigarroa High School, Martin High School and J. W. Nixon High School - meeting the acceptance requirements come to the school either in the morning or in the afternoon. They take one core academic class and one fine art or communication class. The academic classes are taught at the Pre-AP or AP level, meaning a more rigorous curriculum than regular level academic classes. History VMT opened in the fall of 1993, using public buildings such as the Laredo Civic Center and the Holding Institute. Today, the campus is housed in historic buildings throughout the downtown St. Peter's Historical District of Laredo. Later that year, the main building (the old Warren G. Harding Jr. High School) was opened and is used for core academic classes. The Music, Dance, Communications, Visual Art, and Theatre Art classes are in buildings and houses across the street or a few blocks down from the main building. School of Visual Arts The VMT Visual Arts program teaches the art students painting and sketching, of course, but they also must take as a requirement to graduate, Metal Arts and Sculpture classes. Here they learn how to make small statues and jewelry. Students make posters and artwork for school functions, participate in the annual \\"Tapestry\\" literary magazine, and participate in many local art shows. School of Dance The VMT Dance Department offers students various dance classes, such as ballet Folklorico, classical ballet & jazz, flamenco, and modern ballet & tap. These students have performed at the local, state, and national level competitions with great success. School of Theatre The VMT Theatre Department offers acting, directing, and technical production classes. The students prepare monthly performances for their colleagues and community. Every summer, students collaborate with the local community college and university Theatre Arts students, performing well-known Broadway plays. Past productions include \\"The King and I\\", \\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\\", \\"Fame!\\", \\"Anything Goes\\", \\"West Side Story\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" \\"Oliver!\\" \\"The Wiz\\" and \\"The King and I.\\" School of Music The VMT Music Department is the largest fine arts program at VMT.

In addition to applied lessons with their respective teachers, students may join various ensembles, including The VMT Philharmonic Orchestra, SoundTown (showband), Conical Con-X-ion (low brass ensemble), Camerata Winds, or Conjunto Extremo. Mariachi and rondalla guitar ensembles are also popular. These groups regularly perform across the City, and at various local, state, and national competitions. Known as the \\"Hanon Society,\\" this piano performance group is the only one of its kind in South Texas. The MIDI Department offers classes in experimental music, using synthesizers and computer technology for compositional purposes. School of Communications The Communications Department offers classes in radio and television broadcasting, audio and video production as well as newspaper and creative writing. The Communications department staff includes long time journalist Mark Webber and audio and video production specialist Carlos Imperial.

In the book, Conover, a journalist, recounts his experience of learning about the New York State correctional system by becoming a correctional officer for nearly a year. The author went to such lengths after being repeatedly denied cooperation by the New York State Department of Correctional Services. In the book, he divulges the inner-workings of the system. It was the winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction. It starts with a seven-week para-military training academy, which extols the virtues of excellence and diligence. Beside having to pass the academic portion of the academy, recruits are required to face the grueling exposure to chemical agents (tear gas) and complete a timed physical performance test. Instructors define the job of correctional officers as the ‚Äúcare, custody, and control‚Äù of inmates, but what was never discussed in any of Conover‚Äôs academy lessons was the moral aspects. After his graduation, Conover's story continues as he is assigned to Sing Sing correctional facility. Even though officers have the knowledge of procedures, their inexperience is registered immediately and the new arriving officers are identified by the moniker New Jack. In his summation, Conover determines the true role of correctional officers to be the ‚Äúware-housers of human beings.‚Äù Half the time he is in danger and scared for his life.

The letter became a popular literary form in the fourth century AD and combined Christian and classical Greek traditions. The collections of the emperors Julian, Libanios, and Synesius, and the work of the Cappadocian Fathers were particularly notable, while letters of Aristotle, Plato and the Pauline Epistles of the New Testament were influential in the development of the genre. In some cases, large numbers of letters have survived from the more prolific practitioners. Nine hundred from Quintus Aurelius Symmachus (345‚Äì402) survive, and Libanius (c. 314‚Äì392 or 393) left over 1500 letters in Greek. Scholars have sometimes been disappointed with the content of the letters, which have tended to include rhetorical conventions to the exclusion of factual matters, or, in the case of Libanius, to include many generic recommendations on behalf of applicants to the Roman bureaucracy.Cameron, A.

As a journalist and civil servant in interwar Poland, he maintained contacts with leading Ukrainians and urged the Roman Catholic Church to improve relations with the Greek Catholic Church to which most Ukrainians belonged, insisting that Poland's success as a national state depended on satisfying the aspirations of minorities so that minority nationalists would not have convincing arguments against Polish statehood.

History The school was formed from a 1993 merger of Northwest Alabama Community College in Phil Campbell and Shoals Community College in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Northwest Alabama Community College was the state's first junior college, formed in 1963 and first accredited in 1967. Shoals Community College was founded in 1966 as Joe Wheeler State Trade School. Joe Wheeler State Trade School changed its name to Muscle Shoals State Technical Institute and obtained accreditation from the Commission on Occupational Education Institutions in 1973. In 1977 Northwest Alabama State Junior College established a branch campus in Tuscumbia, Alabama. The purpose of the expansion was to provide first and second year college courses for college preparation. In 1989 Northwest Alabama State Junior College in Phil Campbell merged with Northwest Alabama State Technical College in Hamilton, Alabama. At the same time the Tuscumbia branch of Northwest Alabama State Junior College was merged into Muscle Shoals State Technical College to form Shoals Community College. The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted accreditation to Northwest Alabama Community College in 1990 and to Shoals Community College in 1991. Finally, in 1993 the Alabama State Board of Education merged Northwest Alabama Community College and Shoals Community College to form Northwest‚ÄìShoals Community College. The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools approved the merger in 1993 and renewed the school's accreditation in 1999. Northwest‚ÄìShoals Community College is part of the Alabama College System, a statewide system of postsecondary colleges, governed by the Alabama Board of Education. The school derives its original charter from the Alabama Trade School and Junior College Authority Act of 1963. Academics The school awards Associate in Arts, Associate in Science, Associate in Applied Science, and Associate in Occupational Technology degrees as well as certificates in occupationally specific areas. Associate degrees are designated university parallel programs and are easily transferred to a four-year college or university such as the University of Alabama or UAB to complete a bachelor's degree. Certificate programs, in contrast to the associate degree, can last from one semester to two years and certify completion of specific technical or occupational training programs. Some of these programs do not require a high school degree. NW-SCC also offers two- year General Education and Business Administration transfer degrees through Distance Education (http://www.nwscc.edu/distanceeducation/). The school is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

The lighthouse marks the entrance of Lake Winnebago into the Lower Fox River. History The City of Neenah began in 1835 as an agricultural and industrial mission for the Menominee Indians. It was named after the American Indian term for water. After the Civil War, rail transportation was a large factor in the growth of Neenah's local economy. One major outcome of this was the development of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1872. John Alfred Kimberly was one of four men who started this successful company. In 1929, Helen Kimberly Stuart (daughter of J. A. Kimberly) donated some land to the City of Neenah. This land, which overlooked the confluence of Lake Winnebago and the Fox River, was named Kimberly Point Park. In 1944, J. C. Kimberly (son of J. A. Kimberly) realized there was a need for a light to mark the entrance to the river. He donated the $7,500 and hired Flour Brothers Construction Company of nearby Oshkosh for the construction of a , brick and Haydite block lighthouse. The lighthouse began guiding boaters into the Neenah Harbor in 1945. It was later raised to in 1954. In order to protect the site's historic character, the Neenah Landmarks Commission added Kimberly Point Lighthouse to the municipal Register of Historic Places in 2009. Three years later, the lighthouse was added to the Wisconsin State Register of Historic Places, and in 2013 it was approved for the National Register of Historic Places.

Jordan was a skilful inside left but had to bide his time in the Bohemian \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" teams before he made his first team d√©but in December 1931 when Fred Horlacher was away on inter-League duty with the League of Ireland in Wales. He became a permanent name in the starting line up from the 1933/34 season on as either inside or outside left. Jordan's \\"arrival\\" that 33/34 season coincided with another Billy being appointed coach - Bill Lacey. It was Lacey who shrewdly gave Fred Horlacher a new lease of life by moving him back to left half (what might be regarded as a defensive midfield position nowadays) and installed Jordan at inside left. It would prove Jordan's best scoring season, for he scored 16 goals in all competitions as Bohs won the Shield and then the League. Jordan stayed on the left wing during 34/35 and played in a dramatic FAI Cup final against Dundalk though suffering from a knee injury. Bohs were reduced to ten men several times during the match, permanently so with over half an hour to play as the injured Paddy Farrell couldn't continue, but they held on with their backs to the wall for a 4-3 win and it still remains the highest scoring final in its long history. Jordan scored two goals within a minute during the first half to help Bohs on their way. Jordan gave Bohemians ten seasons as a first-teamer. He clocked up exactly 100 League appearances from which he scored 37 goals, bowing out at the end of the 1940/41 season. In all he made 192 first team appearances in all competitions, scoring 67 goals. He came from a sporting family as his brothers Andy and Danny also had long spells at Bohemians.

In 1909 Bray found an architect who drew up the plans but he died in that year before he could carry through with the work. Bray had the lighthouse completed in 1910 which appeared on Light Lists for several decades. William Bray had paid for the lighthouse using his own funds. Later after commercial traffic picked up in the port the government realized the importance of the light so they paid some of its expenses.Internet Public Library: Lighthouses: A Photographic Journey The lighthouse was sold in 1917 and changed hands several times before a restoration job was done the following year. In the 1920s the lighthouse was operated by the Cook & Brown Lime Company which shipped goods along the Fox River. The company owned the lighthouse until at least 1965, further future information is unavailable. At some point the lighthouse was deactivated as the structure no longer appears on the Coast Guard's official Light List.

Like traditional Quakers, also known as Friends, nontheist Friends are interested in realizing peace, simplicity, integrity, community, equality, love, joy, and social justice in the Society of Friends and beyond.  Beliefs  Quakers in the unprogrammed or \\"silent worship\\" tradition of Quaker practice have in the 20th century begun to examine the significance of nontheistic beliefs in the Society of Friends, as part of the Quaker tradition of seeking truth. Non-theism among Quakers probably dates to the 1930s, when some Quakers in California branched off to form the Humanist Society of Friends (today part of the American Humanist Association), and when Henry Cadbury professed agnosticism in a 1936 lecture to Harvard Divinity School students. The term \\"non-theistic\\" first appeared in a Quaker publication in 1952 on conscientious objection.Tatum, Lyle (ed.). 1952. \\"Handbook for Conscientious Objectors.\\" Philadelphia, PA: Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors. In 1976, a Friends General Conference Gathering hosted a well-attended Workshop for Nontheistic Friends (Quakers). Current resources include a nontheist Friends' website and there are nontheist Quaker study groups. Os Cresson began a recent consideration of this issue from behaviorist, natural history, materialist and environmentalist perspectives. Roots and Flowers of Quaker Nontheism is one history. Nontheist Friends draw on Quaker humanist and universalist traditions. The book Godless for God's Sake: Nontheism in Contemporary Quakerism offers recent, critical contributions by Quakers. Some Friends engage the implications of human evolution, cognitive anthropology, evolutionary psychology, bodymind questions (esp. the \\"relaxation response\\"Benson MD, Herbert and Miriam Z.

Nontheist Friends tend to share the Religious Society of Friends (RSOF) historic Quaker peace testimony and support for war resistance and conscientious objection. There are currently three main nontheist Quakers' web sites, including the Nontheist Friends' Official Website, Nontheist Friends Network Website (a listed informal group of Britain Yearly Meeting), and the Nontheist Friends' wiki subject/school at World University and School, which was founded by Scott MacLeod. Nontheist Friends are a group of individuals, many of whom are affiliated or involved in the unprogrammed tradition in Quakerism. Nontheist Friends are attempting sympathetically to generate conversation with others who are more comfortable with the traditional and often reiterated language of Quakerism. Some nontheistic Friends see significance in this lower-case / upper-case distinction in terms of inclusiveness and friendliness, welcoming both to the ongoing NTF email list conversations.

History Originally licensed to Babylon, New York, the 1440 frequency signed on the air on Sunday January 5, 1958 as WBAB with 500 watts daytime only. Operated by Babylon-Bay Shore Broadcasting Company, the station initially played Jazz and featured a large news department as well as extensive community affairs programming. WBAB (and its FM signal on 102.3) switched to a Pop Music format before becoming a Progressive Rock station by the late 1960s. On October 14, 1975, the station's call letters were changed to WNYG (New York Gospel)FCC history after adopting a Gospel music format. The companion FM station, which continued to play rock, was sold shortly after. In the 1980s, WNYG adopted an MOR (Middle of the Road) format called \\"14 Gold\\". Upon receiving nighttime authorization in 1987, WNYG dropped the 14 Gold format and became \\"Long Island's Good Time Oldies\\" on January 1, 1988. The playlist was tightened to focus on pre-Beatles Rock and Roll and Doo-Wop. When cross-town rival WGLI flipped from Oldies to a simulcast of WADO in late 1989, WNYG began to add more 1960s records. By the end of 1993, much of the weekday format had been replaced by Country music and the station unceremoniously dumped the remainder of the oldies format and staff and switched full time to Country music on April 18, 1994. The new format lasted but two months when an agreement was reached to sell WNYG to Bienvenida Broadcasting. The station switched to a Tex-Mex format that featured sporting events and news targeted towards the growing Hispanic population in the area. Bienvenida Broadcasting ran into financial trouble and WNYG ceased operations in March 2000. A month later, a trustee was put into place during bankruptcy proceedings to ready the facility so a new owner could be found to satisfy creditors. During this time, the oldies format that ran from 1988-1994 returned with many of the staff giving the format a fitting sendoff. In June 2000, Multicultural Radio Broadcasting closed on their agreement to acquire the station. After various brokered formats in its first year under Multicultural (including a short lived attempt to open the station up to high school and college students), the station was LMAed to Free-Indeed Broadcasting in 2002. A Contemporary Christian music format was installed. On November 2, 2009, the agreement between Multicultural and Free-Indeed concluded and WNYG ceased broadcasting the eight-year-old Contemporary Christian format that had been branded \\"The Spirit of New York\\". On May 26, 2010, Multicultural Radio Broadcasting sold the station to Radio Cantico Nuevo, Inc for $150,000. A stipulation of the sale was that WNYG could no longer operate from the Babylon facility as Multicultural sought to improve the signal of then co-owned WNSW, which was first adjacent to WNYG at 1430 kHz. On July 1, 2010, the station went silent. On July 18, 2011, the station signed on in its new city of license, Medford, New York. The Medford location allowed Multicultural to make the desired facility upgrades to WNSW. On June 28, 2012, WNYG was granted a U.S. Federal Communications Commission construction permit to add night operation with 196 watts using a directional antenna. Day operation will continue to be 1,000 watts using a non-directional antenna. In late April 2019, \\"Radio Cantico Nuevo\\" swapped with \\"The Breeze\\" format on 1580 AM WLIM. On May 1, 2019, the stations swapped call letters with WNYG becoming WLIM.

Life  Although he claimed to originally be from Sparta, that city no longer existed in the 15th century, so it most likely referred to Mystra, the second largest city in the rapidly decaying Byzantine Empire of the time. Mystra was located in the hills overlooking the ancient ruins of Sparta, was the centre of a major revival in Greek literature at the time, and was the home of Gemistus Pletho. Hermonymus first went to Milan where he worked as a copyist and then to Paris as there was a great need for a Greek teacher and translator at the time. Hermonymus arrived at Paris in 1476, worked as a copyist at the French court. Later, as a lecturer at the Sorbonne he took advantage of the vast collection of ancient Greek books in the libraries of Paris to start his scholarly activities. He became renowned as a teacher of Greek and among his pupils were Erasmus, Budaeus, Reuchlin and Jacques Lef√®vre d'√âtaples.Rachel Giese (1934), \\"Erasmus' Greek Studies\\", The Classical Journal 29(7), pp. 517‚Äì526.

The section from Boscarne Junction to Bodmin General is currently part of the Bodmin and Wenford Steam Railway; the line from Wadebridge to Wenfordbridge is now part of the Camel Trail, and the line to Ruthern Bridge can be followed for much of its length as it runs parallel to a public road.  Background  The Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway (B&W;) opened in 1834 to carry sand brought up the River Camel for use as a soil improver. Extensions were added to Wenfordbridge and Ruthern Bridge to handle freight traffic later that year, particularly stone from the De Lank quarry and Tin from the Mulberry mine. In 1847 the London and South Western Railway bought the B&W;, and connections to the parent company came via the North Cornwall Line in 1895. Connection to the GWR at Bodmin Road was earlier, in 1888, and the line was finally extended to Padstow in 1899. For much of its life the line was famed for the Beattie Well Tanks, three small engines built in the 1870s and transported to Wadebridge by sea to work the lightly laid curves of the line to Wenfordbridge.  Wadebridge to Bodmin  =Wadebridge= =Shooting Range Platform= Sometimes referred to as \\"Rifle Range Platform\\", the platform was built around 1880 (some sources give a date as late as 1885) to serve a firing range, with trains only stopping with written permission from the army. Periods of use centred around the Boer War and World War I. Troops were always sent by rail as there was no other means of access. Use of the range ceased after this, although the platform, with its cinder surface, was used until 1947 or possibly later. Named Shooting Range Platform,Private and Untimetabled Railway stations by G.Croughton although locally known as \\"Target\\", the platform still stands today with a large railway style sign, although none was originally present. =Grogley Halt= Grogley Halt opened on 2 July 1906 in association with the railmotor service between Bodmin North and Wadebridge although the wooden platform was unlit and trains only stopped during daylight. It is unclear whether any shelter was provided initially, but a GWR style pagoda shelter was provided before 1933, being replaced by a wooden shelter when the platform was rebuilt in concrete in the 1950s. The line just north of Grogley halt was realigned in 1888, the junction to Ruthern Bridge being on the old alignment which was disconnected at one end only. A ground frame controlled the new junction and the access was gated, beyond this access involved a reversal on the old alignment to gain the Ruthern Bridge line. The early method of accessing the platform across the River Camel is unclear as access was latterly via the bridge that carried the Ruthern Bridge line after that was lifted in 1934, and a reproduction of a map from 1907 does not show the halt or any access. The steam rail motor made 14 trips a day giving a regular service, but this had reduced to 8 in each direction by 1938 and 7 in each direction in 1966, the year before closure. The station closed to passengers on 30 January 1967. Today the platform survives in relatively good condition.  Opened here as part of the original line was a single siding, or wharf, which at one time included a goods shed. Latterly the siding was gated and the controlling ground frame was in a wooden shelter which was erected in April 1943. The wharf was taken out of use on 2 May 1960 and removed in 1961. The date of the level crossing and associated signal box is a matter of conjecture, but the signal box and crossing gates probably date from 1888 when the junction at Boscarne was created. The rough track which crossed the railway at this location was improved by the LSWR for the opening of the halt on 2 July 1906. The halt itself as at Grogley, was of timber without any form of shelter. A GWR \\"pagoda\\" shelter was provided later which lasted into the 1960s. The siding was closed 2 May 1960 and the associated ground frame removed in April 1961. Like Grogley, the early rail motor service made 14 trips each day, with the service reducing to 8 each way in 1938 and 7 each way immediately before closure. The station closed to passengers on 30 January 1967. Today the station survives in a rather poor state, most of the platform has been taken over by bushes, with one of the old station buildings used as a garden shed. Remnants of the former level crossing can still be seen. =Boscarne Junction= Boscarne Junction was created in September 1887 when the GWR opened a line connecting from their station in Bodmin to the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway (now owned by the L&SWR;). It was a simple Y-shaped junction, with a signal-box and level-crossing where the two lines diverged. Latterly this was referred to as Boscarne No.1 Junction, and while some references give Dunmere Junction being referred to as Boscarne No.2 Junction, a ground Frame installed immediately in the fork of the Ex-GWR and Ex-SR lines installed in May 1913 was Boscarne No2. Junction. The purpose of the GWR line was to take china clay from Wenford clay dries to the docks at Fowey, the traffic having previously been taken by the LSWR to Wadebridge. Originally there was a single siding between the two diverging lines, which was connected to them at both ends and used for the exchange of traffic between the GWR and L&SWR.; The line to Wenfordbridge diverged from the line to Bodmin North a short distance to the east at Dunmere Junction, where there was just a ground- frame. In 1914L&SWR; Signal Instruction 8 of 1914 a second loop siding was added at Boscarne Junction on the north side of the L&SWR; line, extending from the signal-box almost to Dunmere Junction, and this was used then mainly for the transfer of the Wendfordbridge traffic. The line to Wadebridge closed on 17 December 1978 and was truncated at the road just beyond the signal box in 1981. The line here closed completely on 3 October 1983, but trains returned to Boscarne Junction in 1997 when the Bodmin and Wenford Steam Railway built a platform and began operating trains from Bodmin General. This new platform is west of the site of Boscarne Exchange Platform (see next section). =Boscarne Exchange Platform= The platforms here were completed in May 1964, and from 15 June that year the passenger service between Bodmin North and Wadebridge was truncated at Boscarne Junction, passengers from Bodmin North using a shuttle service operated by an AC railbus, also serving Dunmere Halt, to travel as far as Boscarne; onward travel was by using the Bodmin General to Padstow services. In order for passengers to change trains, British Railways built a station , among the smallest in England. Alongside the line to Bodmin North it had a small patch of clear ground, sometimes described as a Ground- or Rail-Level platform, to allow the railbus to lower the ladder fitted below the passenger door, while there was one small platform at a more normal height which was long enough for just one coach situated on the line to Bodmin General, this being dominated by a huge sign stating 'Boscarne Junction. Change for Dunmere and Bodmin North'. There was no shelter, no public access, no tickets, and initially no lighting. The station, referred to in the timetable as Boscarne Exchange Platform, closed on 18 April 1966 when two trains daily from Bodmin General reversed at the junction, travelling to Dunmere Halt and Bodmin North before returning and continuing on to Wadebridge. It reopened on 2 May 1966 before closing with the line on 30 January 1967.Passengers No More by G.Daniels and L.Dench second edition page 27 Today, nothing exists of the former platform. The Bodmin and Wenford Railway opened in 1997 a station called Boscarne Junction a short distance west of the site of the exchange platform. =Dunmere Halt= Dunmere Halt Dunmere Halt was opened, like the halts at Grogley and Nanstallon, on 2 July 1906 in association with the railmotor service between Bodmin North and Wadebridge. The original platform at Dunmere is a matter of conjecture, but in the 1960s it was of concrete with a GWR style pagoda shelter. The halt was situated in a shallow cutting, and access was by a short footpath sloping down from the A389 overbridge which was situated at one end of the platform. Again the rail motor service made 14 trips each day with this reducing to 8 trains each way in 1938. With the inauguration of Boscarne Exchange Platform, there were 5 trains each way in 1965 with the first outbound originating from Wadebridge and the last return terminating at Wadebridge; other than these it was a shuttle service between Bodmin North and Boscarne Exchange Platform. By 1966 there were just 2 trains each way, both starting/terminating at Bodmin Road. The station closed to passengers on 30 January 1967 when operation of the line from Dunmere Junction to Bodmin North ceased. The platform is still in situ today and has been carefully maintained. The trackbed is now a footpath. =Bodmin North= Bodmin North in 1964 When the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway opened on 4 July 1834, trains could only get as far as a temporary terminus at Dunmere, the station at Bodmin not being opened until 30 September 1834. From 1 November 1886 to 1 November 1895 the station was closed to allow for a realignment of the railway at Dunmere, replacing a level crossing with an overbridge, and complete renewal of the track. The new station had a single platform face containing the station building and a canopy. South of the platform road was a run-round and a third road giving access to a short siding and a cattle dock. In addition a siding left the line in front of the signal box via a double-slip to serve the goods shed There was also a trailing link to a private siding for the gas works opposite. A 50-foot turntable had been provided before the rebuilding work, and remained connected although usage was low as most passenger trains where operated by tank engines. The station was renamed Bodmin North in 1949 to differentiate it from Bodmin General. Freight facilities were withdrawn on 24 July 1964 although by this time the lines to the cattle dock had already been lifted on 10 May 1964 and those to the Gas Works on 20 February 1964. The station and all facilities closed on 30 January 1967. The station has been completely demolished and the site is now occupied by a car park. Boscarne to Bodmin General =St Lawrence Platform= A platform, nominally provided for the hamlet of St Lawrence, was opened in 1906 on the GWR line from Bodmin to Boscarne Junction. It closed in 1917. =Bodmin General= The Great Western Railway opened a terminus in Bodmin on 27 May 1887, the line diverging from the Cornish Main Line at Bodmin Road. On 3 September 1888 a new line connected with the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway at Dunmere Junction. Passenger services ceased on 30 January 1967, freight services were withdrawn from Bodmin General on 1 May 1967 and the signal box closed later that year but the station was retained as a reversal point for freight trains from Wenford until 3 October 1983. It is now the principal station of the Bodmin and Wenford Steam Railway. Grogley to Ruthern Bridge =Ruthern Bridge= The extension to Ruthern Bridge was opened on 30 September 1834, and served mines in the locality producing copper, iron and lead, and especially tin from Mulberry Mine. Provision for this traffic was made by two sidings, one of which ran over a series of sand drops; an additional loop capable of accommodating eight wagons was added 6 chains towards Grogley in 1914. There were proposals in the 1870s to extend the line to connect with the Cornwall Minerals Railway but these came to nothing, so the only change made to the line was provision at an early date of a siding near to Grogley junction to serve an ochre pit although this was removed soon after the pit ceased working in 1912. There was never any passenger service, Ruthern Bridge being little more than a small collection of cottages and farms, although in the early years passengers were conveyed unofficially in the tool wagon. The line, which climbed steadily at 1 in 158 for most of its length, closed on 29 November 1933 with the track being lifted the following year. Boscarne Junction to Wenfordbridge =Minor sidings= Dunmere The single trailing siding at Dunmere, which was situated on the left of the line immediately after crossing the A389, was a public siding (as opposed to a private siding), and for much of its life the main traffic was grain for Hawke's mill. Originally termed \\"borough bounds wharf\\" for being just outside the Bodmin boundary, the siding closed on 14 May 1969 and was removed in November that year. Penhargard A single facing siding was provided at Penhargard, although it was closed and removed prior to 1925. Helland A single facing siding was provided on the side of the line nearest the River Camel at Helland Wharf. Pictures show the buildings, as at other places on the B&W;, extremely close to the line. The siding closed on 2 May 1960. Tresarrett Quarry A single facing siding with a gate was provided for Tresarrett quarry from around 1922, but closed in the 1930s. A narrow-gauge line ran across the river by a small bridge (still there in 1991) to bring material from the quarry on the other side of the river. There is the substantial remains of a loading ramp right by the trackbed still there 2013. Stump Oak siding A loop 7 chains in length was provided at Stump Oak, or Parkyns, around 1880 although this had been removed by 1923. Tresarrett Wharf At Tresarret there was a loop on the north side of the line some 6 chains in length, this was closed in July 1970 and removed the following year. A shorter siding on the other side of the line was removed on 18 January 1932. =Wenford clay dries= China clay traffic started in 1862 and eventually English China Clays Lovering Pochin had six clay dries at Wenford sidings served by a pipe delivering clay slurry from Stannon Moor over four miles distant. Initially there was a loop serving dries 1 and 2, with a line extending back then diverging to give access to dries 3 to 6 which were set back further from the main running line. The first part of the loop by dries 3-6 and associated access, including the facing point, were removed between 1920 and 1922, at which time the loop to dries 1 and 2 was extended by 9 chains towards Wenfordbridge. Traffic to the dries was coal inward and china clay outward; high quality bagged clay in vans and lower quality in sheeted open wagons called clay hoods. After the closure of Wenfordbridge in 1971 the line ended just beyond the clay dries, 11 miles and 71 chains from Wadebridge. The line closed completely on 3 October 1983. =Wenfordbridge= The hamlet of Wenfordbridge was the furthest outpost of the LSWR from London Waterloo. It opened on 30 September 1834 as part of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway and after an unsuccessful proposal in the 1870s to extend the line to Delabole changed very little until closure in 1971. There were three sidings for loading and unloading goods, predominantly coal inwards and stone out from local quarries, basic manpower being supplemented in 1926 by the Southern Railway installing a five-ton capacity gantry crane spanning two of the sidings. A fourth siding continued on to the De Lank quarries. The layout was altered in 1922 by the extension of one of the sidings towards Wenford in order to create a run-round loop, but there were no other changes until the link to the quarry and one of the sidings were closed on 31 October 1966. These were removed in 1967 although the De Lank rails remained beyond the road. =De Lank Quarry= At the end of one of the sidings at Wenfordbridge the line continued, curving sharply off to the right and crossing the public road without barrier or sign before continuing via a rope-worked incline of 1 in 8 over a hill and down to the De Lank Quarries of Thos W Ward half a mile distant. The incline itself was of three rails; the inner or centre rail being common to wagons both ascending and descending the incline. There was no engine working the incline which worked on the balance principle; horsepower was used for shunting until introduction of a Simplex shunter in the 1920s. The line was opened in the 1890s and closed around 1940 although the rails across the road remained until 1967 when the link to British Rail was removed.

It is a fantasy-drama in which Death personified is the main character. It takes place in a small village in the Spanish Principality of Asturias. The play consists of four acts. Synopsis =Act I= The Narces family is introduced in this act. It is revealed that the mother mysteriously lost a daughter, Angelica, to the large river in their town four years ago. Angelica was married to a young man named Martin three days before her apparent death. Her body was never found, and thus no proper burial was performed. The memory of her death still dwells in the minds of her family. The play starts on the anniversary of her death. \\"La Peregrina\\" (The Pilgrim in English) shows up at the door, who is traveling on the Camino de Santiago, or \\"Way of St. James,\\" as it is translated into English. Since pilgrims are said to bring blessings upon the houses they visit, the family allows her inside. The grandfather recognizes her but doesn't remember from where he knows her. The children play a game with her, and she laughs in a strange way, which scares the children. She says she has never laughed before. She is also surprised by the fact that she had felt her beating heart. Suddenly, the woman becomes fatigued and falls asleep. She tells the children to wake her up before nine, which they fail to do because they go to bed. =Act II= The Grandfather realizes that The Pilgrim is the personification of death; he recognizes her from a near-death experience he had years before in the mine accident which killed all the children, total of seven, of the family servant, Telva. He pleads with her to leave his family alone, as they have suffered enough already because of her. The Pilgrim had actually come to kill Martin but was unable to, because she was asleep when Martin was supposed to die. Described in very human terms in the play, she explains she is merely fulfilling her mission, and doesn't like having to be present whenever someone dies. She explains to the grandfather she has a difficult life, never being able to die yet being death itself. The grandfather takes pity on her referring to her as a \\"poor woman.\\" Meanwhile, Martin brings back a girl by the name of Adela, who had tried to commit suicide in the river. The Pilgrim admits that she wasn't expecting the young girl's death. Even so, she says that Adela will again search for her (death), and next time she will find it. The grandfather is told by the pilgrim that he and the family will be happy at her return despite the fact that when she returns in seven months, it will be to take the life of Adela. =Act III= Adela becomes part of the family, unwittingly beginning to take the role that Angelica had once had, as daughter, lover, and sister. She tries to make the mother happy by wearing Angelica's clothes and trying as much as possible to appear to be Angelica. Martin reveals two secrets. The first secret he discloses is that Angelica was not dead; she had run away with a lover. Martin knew this, but allowed the family to believe she was dead so as not to ruin their memory of her. In addition to this, although he has been rough and has not spoken very much to Adela, he is really in love with her. Martin also describes the town's dislike of Adela, whom they believe is trying to take what was rightfully Angelica's, and trying to take away Angelica's husband. He decides that he must leave to protect Adela from the town's anger, but later decides to act against it. The grandfather feels uncomfortable with Adela taking the place of Angelica, and also fears this, because of The Pilgrim's future return. Angelica's mother is extremely pleased with Adela's role as her new daughter. She hears of the romance between Adela and Martin. Although she disapproves of Martin marrying another besides her daughter, she gives the couple her blessing. =Act IV= Angelica comes back during the festival of San Juan, unbeknownst to her family. She has been miserable because her lover has long since left her. She is worn down and wanted to beg forgiveness and hopes Martin will forgive her and take her back. Ashamed of her actions, she wants to resume her previous life, just the way she left it. The Pilgrim, having returned, tells her that is not possible: she has already been replaced by Adela. The pilgrim realizes her true mission: she has been sent for Angelica. It is Angelica's proper time to die; she must join the pilgrim in the river (that is, drown herself) in order to preserve her image and prevent any shame from being brought upon the family. When Angelica's body is found, seemingly perfectly preserved after supposedly being dead for years, the mother announces that it is a miracle. An appropriate burial is finally held, allowing her family to finally deal with her death. The pilgrim then leaves, commenting on how she envies mortal existence and love. Film versions and opera adaptation La Dama del Alba has been filmed at least four times: in 1950 and 1966 for movie theatres, and three times for television, perhaps even more. The 1966 film version featured Dolores del R√≠o as The Pilgrim. There has also been a made-for-TV French version. The play is little-known in English- speaking countries, and has never been filmed in English. The play has been adapted into an opera by Slovak composer Bartolomej Urbanec (as Pani √∫svitu), which premiered in the Slovak National Theatre, Bratislava, in 1976.

They are usually unsmoked or lightly smoked, and sold in pairs joined at one end.

It lies only a 10-minute walk away from the city centre. Remains of the old castle moat are still visible, as well as the massive entrance and most of the walls.  History  The castle was built on a hill above the crossroads of then important routes in the northwestern corner of the Sava valley, above the medieval market town of Samobor. The castle was erected by the supporters of Czech king, Ottokar II of Bohemia, between 1260 and 1264, who was then in a war with Hungarian king Stephen V.Stari grad Samobor, from site Ing-grad (Retrieved: September 27, 2010) Croatian-Hungarian forces under command of duke of Okiƒá soon retook the castle, for which he was granted the city of Samobor, as well as the privilege to collect local taxes. The fortification was originally a stone fortress built on solid rock - in an irregular and indented layout, which consists of three parts, out of which the central core represents the oldest part of the castle. In the southeastern part of the core there was a high guard tower (nowadays in ruins), which is the only remaining original part of Ottokar castle. Just next to the guard tower lies a semicircular tower with a small gothic chapel of St. Ana which is estimated to be built in third decade of the 16th century. Layout of Samobor Castle 3d reconstruction of Samobor Castle In the third decade of the 16th century, reshaping of a castle begint which was done by a gradual expansion of the core towards the north. The fortification thus became an elongated trapezoidal courtyard surrounded by a strong defensive wall and with a pentagonal tower on its ends. Throughout 17th and 18th century, the castle was upgraded and reconstructed.Tourist Board of Zagreb County, through County The last building inside the fortress was a three-storey house on its southern side, which along with castle's upper parts forms a courtyard. Its facades are divided by Tuscan columned porches, and its interior is rich with the equipment. This move transformed a castle from its original fortificational function into a countryside baroque styled castle. Last residents left the castle in the end of the 18th century, which triggered the gradual castle's decadence into a shape that it is today. = Rulers and owners= The first known owners of the castle were family of Baboniƒá, after who, Samobor Castle came under ownership of Hungarian-Croatian kings. During the 15th century the castle became property of Counts of Celje. At the beginning of the 16th century, Castle came into a possession of feudal family Frankopan. After that, the castle changed many owners, Counts; Tr≈æac, Tahy, Auersperg, Kiepach. The last owners of the castle, who actually lived in it, were Counts of Erd√∂dy-Kulmer. Samobor's municipal government decided to purchase the castle from its previous owner - Montecuccoli family in 1902. From that point on, the castle with its surrounding served as a local picnic place.  Restoration Nowadays, Samobor Castle is just a picturesque ruin above Vugrin≈°ƒçak creek in Samobor city centre. Even though a project of castle restoration exists, only the chapel walls were renovated so far. In its restoration, the stones of the ruined castle parts, cement and slaked lime were used.

It was last assigned to the Tenth Air Force, stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. It was inactivated on 8 January 2011. History =Need for reserve troop carrier groups= During the first half of 1955, the Air Force began detaching Air Force Reserve squadrons from their parent wing locations to separate sites. The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning. Continental Air Command (ConAC)'s plan called for placing Air Force Reserve units at fifty-nine installations located throughout the United States. When these relocations were completed in 1959, reserve wing headquarters and wing support elements would typically be on one base, along with one (or in some cases two) of the wing's flying squadrons, while the remaining flying squadrons were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 Although this dispersal was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the units being released on 22 November 1962. The formation of troop carrier groups occurred in January 1963 for units that had not been mobilized, but was delayed until February for those that had been.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 =Activation of 917th Troop Carrier Group= As a result, the 917th Troop Carrier Group was established at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana on 17 January 1963, as the headquarters for the 78th Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since March 1958.Maurer, pp. 280-281 Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 78th. The group's mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs for Military Air Transport Service long range airlift operations. =Special Operations= Became Special Operations group in 1972, flying Cessna A-37 Dragonfly; Tactical Fighter Group in 1973, receiving A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft in 1981. =Composite Wing= The units of this Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) wing was composed of the 45th and 47th Fighter Squadrons with their A-10s, and the 93d Bomb Squadron in the B-52H Formal Training Unit (FTU) mission and the 343d Bomb Squadron flying combat missions as an associate unit to the 2d Bomb Wing in the B-52H. The 917th's mission was to train pilots and crews to fly the A-10 and B-52H and perform strategic heavy bombardment and maritime operations with the B-52s. The Wing had approximately 1,600 Air Force Reserve personnel. On 8 January 2011, Air Force Reserve Command inactivated the 917th Wing, transferring its B-52 units to the newly activated 307th Bomb Wing. The 917th Operations Group was re-designated as the 917th Fighter Group. The Group realigned under the 442d Fighter Wing, Whiteman AFB, Missouri.

Geography  The town lies in the South Eifel region, approximately 10 km southwest of Bitburg. It is situated in the west edge of the Nims valley and a brook that leads to the Nims flows through the town. The highest point of the municipality is the \\"Gro√üenb√ºsch\\" at 379 meters above sea level, the lowest point is the Dockendorf Mill at 225 meters above sea level. 60% of the 5.82 km¬≤ municipality is used for agriculture, and 30% is covered by forest.  History  The town in its current form most likely arose from the time of the capture of the land by the Frankish Empire. However, the Romans had already settled parts of the area, as evidenced by remnants of a tower castle near the Dockendorf mill. The first documented reference to Dockendorf occurred in 1270. For many years, the municipality belonged to the Luxembourgish Propstei of Bitburg and since 1816 to the Prussian Bitburg-Pr√ºm district. During the French period, Dockendorf was the mairie, which later became the office of the mayor (B√ºrgermeisterei). This expanded to include the municipality of Wolsfeld, and in 1970, these plus four other municipalities were combined as the result of communal reform to join the Bitburg-Pr√ºm Verbandsgemeinde.  Municipal Council The municipal council of Dockendorf consists of six councilors elected by the local plurality election in Rhineland-Palatinate on May 25, 2014.  Attractions  Throughout the municipality lie many landmark farmhouses from the 18th and 19th centuries. The most important structures in Dockendorf include the Forest Chapel (Waldkapelle), the parish church, and the old rectory, which exhibits four different architectural styles. The rectory has been restored both inside and out and is an important regional cultural monument. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, a total of five calvaries were built in the district. The nearby \\"Scharren bei Dockendorf\\" nature reserve hosts a selection of rare plant species. Economy Dockendorf is an extremely agriculture-dependent municipality, supporting both full-time and part-time farming operations. In the last few years, the amount of agriculturally-suitable land has grown in comparison to neighboring municipalities. In addition, both a construction company and a distillery have begun operations in Dockendorf. Nonetheless, most working residents living in Dockendorf commute to Trier, Bitburg, or Luxembourg. The Bundesstra√üe 257 lies one kilometer east of Dockendorf and connects the town with the Bundesautobahn 60 in Bitburg, 10 km away.

It is south of Eureka and west of US Highway 101. Table Bluff County Park provides access to the South Spit. The park is also used as a hang-gliding and paragliding staging area. The federally endangered western lily, Lilium occidentale, is found growing on Table Bluff at Table Bluff Ecological Reserve. History Early explorers of the bay called the landform Ridge Point and Brannan Bluff, but by 1851 Table Bluff had stuck. Seth Kinman was an early resident. Because of its rich soil, Table Bluff has been the site of a small agricultural community since the 1850s. At present, hay fields and cattle ranches occupy most of the bluff.

After the 1.5 release in 1994 active development came to a halt. TinTin++ 1.5 had gained significant popularity however, and being public domain this resulted in many derivative works like zMUD, yTin, Lyntin, Pueblo, WinTin95, and GGMud.

Zoo director Bill Foster argued that the stress caused by travel and resettlement would not be healthy for Mona, and that she should not, at her age, have been subjected to the behavior and pecking order of an unfamiliar herd. He indicated that the zoo planned to improve her habitat and was considering adding a companion to her exhibit. On June 18, 2007 zoo staff found Mona unable to stand on her own and assisted her with slings. It was surmised that one of her legs had become numb from her lying on it. She was placed on 24-hour watch and appeared to be in good health and spirits in subsequent evaluations.

A wanderer from boyhood, he was always impatient for new horizons. John Boultbee, Adventurer By 1816, Boultbee was bound for Brazil. He was in Barbados in 1818, intending to be a planter, but left after four months, sickened by the cruelties of slavery. He emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) with his brother Edwin in 1823, and dreamed of reaching that 'second Elysium', Tahiti. The reality was the hard life of a sealer. so after two years and considerable privations in Bass Strait, in March 1826 he sailed for southern New Zealand. By March 1828 he was back in Port Jackson (Sydney), toiling at ship ballasting and fish-curing. He went to the new Swan River settlement in Western Australia in 1829, and then in January 1833 joined a whaler bound for Timor. After visits to the Philippines and Singapore, he arrived at Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in May 1834, remaining there until his death, probably in 1854. He compiled his 'Journal of a rambler', an account of his life from 1817 to 1834, in Ceylon about 1835. Travels in New Zealand His New Zealand travels began in Port Jackson in March 1826 when he joined a sealing party employed by Daniel Cooper and Solomon Levey, and embarked on the brig Elizabeth. On 5 April the ship anchored in George Sound, and boat crews and provisions were landed. Boultbee was assigned to a boat carrying six weeks' victuals, three muskets, a dog and clothing, which headed 'about 100 miles to the Northward'. Reaching 'wild romantic looking' Milford Sound the first day, they found game aplenty including weka, kakapo and kiwi. They visited Cascade Point, and at Open Bay (Jackson Bay) saw a broken spear and flax sandals which were the first signs of MƒÅori presence. The party landed on the Open Bay Islands, where they found a few provisions and messages from previous visitors in a hut used by earlier sealers. Vegetables grown by the former gang made a welcome change from salt fare. Sealing went on apace: the first haul was made from a rock chimney, and more seals were obtained on an island off the mouth of the Paringa River. A constant watch was kept against surprise attack. Boultbee related that MƒÅori refugees from Banks Peninsula, were plundering and killing boat crews around the southern coast. An attack came at what is now Arnott Point. Boultbee laid about him with an oar while others loaded and fired guns, and the dog bit as the boat was launched for a get-away. There were casualties on both sides. Boultbee' recounted wet, miserable nights, good crayfishing, reunion with two other boat crews at Milford Sound, and an exciting run before a gale to Dusky Sound. A blazing fire, flapjacks, pork and a singsong restored everyone's spirits. When an accidental musket-shot narrowly missed Boultbee, he comforted himself with a reflection on 'the timely interposition of Providence which thus preserved me.' A narrow escape from a runaway log was another manifestation of 'Divine Mercy'. He noted that he was much changed from 'the delicate youth' he had been, and was now 'as rough a piece of goods as ever weathered the wide world'. The rest of the crew, watching his busy pen as he wrote his journal, regarded him as 'a regular scholard', an incongruous, educated presence in a mostly illiterate company. Some months were spent in Dusky Sound before the Elizabeth returned with provisions and clothing, on its way to Foveaux Strait. Boultbee's boat followed the Elizabeth after a few days, reaching Pahia, the westernmost MƒÅori settlement on the southern coastline, where the crew were welcomed by Jacky Price and his consort, Hinewhitia. Boultbee joined whole- heartedly in the communal life. There were trips across the strait to The Neck on Stewart Island/Rakiura and to Ruapuke Island. Bluff, Omaui, Wakapatu, Te Waewae, Codfish Island, are all vividly described in terms of the occupants' lives, their customs and language. Boultbee's ear for language was acute, and he compiled an extensive vocabulary of MƒÅori expressions. His portraits of the chiefs Te Whakataupuka of Ruapuke and the dying Te Wera of Bluff, among others, are a valuable addition to our knowledge. If wanderlust had not kept him on the move, he might have accepted Te Whakataupuka's invitation to remain on Ruapuke. Boultbee joined a sealing gang from the Samuel, and stowed away on the ship at Paterson Inlet, landing penniless in Port Jackson on 8 March 1828. His journal was compiled 'more for the amusement of my relations and friends, than with a view to that of the Public', but his first-hand account of the sealing industry on New Zealand's southern coasts is a rare and vital record of a trade cloaked in the secrecy of competition.

Ewaso Ng'iro is a river in Kenya which rises on the west side of Mount Kenya and flows north then east and finally south-east, passing through Somalia where it joins the Jubba River. The upper basin of the Ewaso Ng'iro River is . The river has a continuous water supply due to the glaciers on Mount Kenya. Ewaso Ng'iro feeds into Lake Ol Bolossat, the only lake in Nyandarua county and the larger Central Kenya. Ewaso Ng'iro crosses seven arid to semi-arid landscapes. It is characterized by vastly different physiographic features and species and has become a fundamental component to the survival of the wildlife, as well as the expansion of human population and socio-economic developments. Water, the limited land resource provided by the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed is unevenly distributed throughout the higher and lower regions of the catchment due to the large percentage necessary to maintain agricultural practices and climatic changes (Mutiga, Su, and Woldai 3). Ewaso Ng'iro River The river's name is derived from the local community's language. It means the river of brown or muddy water. It is also called by some the \\"Ewaso Nyiro.\\" In the arid north of Kenya, water means life. The waters of this great river draw wildlife in great numbers to its banks, creating an oasis of green. Samburu, Shaba and Buffalo Springs National Reserves in Northern Kenya teem with wildlife in an otherwise arid land, because of the water of the river. Below Sericho, the river expands into the Lorian Swamp, a large area of wetlands. The ecological diversity throughout the catchment is unique to the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed specifically, as it originates from the high agriculturally potent lands of Mount Kenya, right at Thome Area of Nanyuki-Laikipia County, that means the exact start point of this river is at the Thome village where it is formed out of covergence of Naromoru River, sourcing water from Mt. Kenya and Ngarinyiru River sourcing water from Aberdares and it flows over the following seven arid to semi arid land districts Meru, Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo, Wajir, Marsabit, and Garissa (Said et al. 14). Following the independence of Kenya, the stretches of land covered by the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed shifted ownership from the colonial farmers to small scale farmers (Thenya et al. 2). The catchment became a main resource for the small scale farmers to support their agropastorial practices and developing livelihoods (Thenya et al. 2). Ewaso Narok river is one of its tributaries. Thomson's Falls near Nyahururu town are located along Ewaso Narok.  Resource Availability  ‚ÄúKenya‚Äôs renewable supply of fresh water is less than 650 cubic meters per capita per year, making it one of the most water-scarce countries in the world‚Äù states the African Development Fund (African Development Fund 6). Although the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro is the largest of five water catchments in Kenya, a shortage in natural resource availability has become prevalent ever so increasingly in the past few years (Said et al. 5). Climate Change The tributaries that drain into the catchment have progressively began to dry up, particularly throughout the dry seasons of the year (Mutiga, Su, and Woldai 102). Other changes such as ‚Äúunreliable rainfall patterns and quantities and decreasing discharge during the low flow periods‚Äù also have significant impacts on all aspects of the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed (Aeschbacher, Liniger and Weingartner 155,156). The water catchment lies predominantly through arid to semi arid landscapes where the annual levels of rainfall and precipitation have seemingly decreased over the years (Mutiga, Su, and Woldai 102). As uneven water distribution has become a complex issue, the ability to support the ecosystem's vegetation and wildlife will decrease, and human populations and developments will be faced with ongoing sustainability challenges. Evapotranspiration Such phenomenon as mentioned above may be interconnected to the evapotranspiration levels in the catchment, however, obtaining a direct measurement of such energy exchanges has proven to be difficult and complex process (Mutiga, Su, and Woldai 100).  Environmental Sustainability  The Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed stretches over a diverse variety of ecosystems from the high regions of Mount Kenya to the lower arid to semi arid regions of land. Each ecosystem delivers a unique contribution to the land and people of Kenya as they interact with one another to achieve a sustainable equilibrium. Wetland The wetland ecosystems which are located in the higher regions of Mount Kenya provide a natural water filtration system, a variety of plant and animal species, and nutrients for all other species and ecosystems (Said et al. 8). Due to the recent population influx, Kenya's wetlands have deteriorated, and establishments have become a major hindrance to the ecosystem services (Thenya et al. 6). Agro-ecosystem Agro-ecosystems are common in developments in the higher regions of the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed and contribute the forage necessary to sustain wildlife, livestock, as well as human populations (Said et al. 8). By supporting and sustaining all the different ecosystems throughout the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed, it will allow for the environment to flourish as naturally as possible. Disturbances in the ecosystems will impact the growth and sustainability of other species.  Developmental Sustainability  The importance of sustaining the ecosystems that are supported by the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed are crucial for the established populations on both a personal and developmental level. Since 2009, the population that resides in the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro catchment has increased by slightly over 1.5 million in the past 42 years (Said et al. 14). This increase has been seen in particularly the middle to upper regions of the catchment mainly for agropastorial settlements. (Kiteme and Gikonyo 333). A large percentage of water is used by the upper regions of the catchment for irrigation of crops that contributes to the sustainability of ‚Äúcurrent and future degradation of ecosystems that affect the livelihoods and sustainability [‚Ä¶] and long term efforts to reduce poverty (Payet and Obura 24). Human populations rely heavily on the environment and ecosystems as a means of support in terms of ‚Äúprovisioning services, regulating services, cultural services, and supporting services‚Äù as briefly outlined by The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Said et al. 9). In the more densely populated areas around the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro catchment, market establishments have begun forming with the small scale farmers as a major contributor (Said et al. 27). The over exploitation of natural resource in the upper regions of the catchment are increasingly making development process and agricultural practices more difficult for those situated near the lower regions (Mutiga, Su, and Woldai 102). Humans have increased their livelihood and developments through the utilization of the ecosystems in the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro catchment however, severe consequences may arise due to the exploitation and climatic changes that strongly influence the availability to access water.  Conflicts  Due to the arid to semi arid landscapes which surround the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed, levels of availability to access and utilize the water decrease as the demand for human consumption and agricultural systems increase (Said et al. 14). Populations situated near the higher regions of the catchment have much greater availability to the natural resource, and have utilized them for agropastorial purposes. However, when these practices are paired up with Kenya's arid to semi arid landscape climatic changes, the downstream population's access to the natural resource has become much more limited (Weismann et al. 12). Those situated in the lower regions of the Ewaso Ng‚Äôiro watershed have faced unremitting pressure to access the natural resource to continue to sustain their growing human population and developments (Kiteme and Gikonyo 332). According to the Mountain and Research Development team, ‚Äúthese transboundary problems add to the cultural, religious and political tensions existing in most societies which today are being increasingly integrated into the world economy‚Äù (Hurni 386).

It was invented in the 19th century by Joseph Williams Lovibond and updated versions are still available. Description The device is used to determine the color of liquids. A sample is put in a glass tube. The tube is inserted in the comparator and compared with a series of coloured glass discs until the nearest possible match is found. Among other things, the device is used to determine the concentration of certain chemicals in solution. In this use, some assumptions are made about what is in the sample. Given those assumptions, the concentration will be indicated by the disc which best matches the color of the solution. There are a number of standard tests in which a sample to be tested is mixed a colour reagent. In such tests, the resulting color indicates the concentration of the sample under test. Results can be approximate compared to other testing techniques, but the comparator is useful for field work because it is portable, rugged and easy to use. If a more exact measurement is required other tests can be conducted in a laboratory. It is used in chemistry lab where the pH of the sample can be measured(approximately) using lovibond comparator.

They were deactivated and moved to shore as part of a channel-widening project. History lower Green Bay in 1867 showing the sinuous channel among the sand bars into the harbor Navigation to the mouth of the Fox River was impeded by a series of sand bars jutting out from either side of Green Bay, and thus in 1837 funds were appropriated for the purpose of erecting a light in the area. An initial recommendation to place such a light on Grassy Island (the most southerly of those bars) was countered by the observations of a Lt. Homans, who in visiting the area found the selected site \\"to be unsuitable for construction of buildings upon it of any durability, and totally uninhabitable by a keeper, being nearly under water, from the great rise of the lake, since the recommendation for a light upon it was made.\\" Instead, the Long Tail Point Light was erected further north. In 1866 dredging of a new channel into the harbor began. This new channel cut straight across Grassy Island, and an appropriation of $11,000 for construction of lights had been included in the 1864 budget. Due to the delays in the associated harbor improvements, the funds reverted to the treasury and a new appropriation had to be made in 1870, with construction of the two towers and associated keeper's house following in 1872. The two towers were largely identical except for their heights: freestanding wooden pyramidal towers covered in shingles, topped by octagonal lanterns holding sixth-order Fresnel lenses. Initially both displayed a fixed white light. One tower stood at either end of the cut on its eastern side, with the keeper's house standing between them. The exposed location did lead to maintenance issues, with the roof of the dwelling being replaced in 1880, barely a decade after its construction. A new well was dug in 1884, the first having been filled in by a gale shortly after the station opened. The kitchen and boathouse were rebuilt in 1896; the boathouse was raised further in 1902. In the meantime a breakwater had been built to the east of the station. This light was an obvious candidate for automation and was fitted with acetylene lamps in 1934; At the same time the characteristic of both lights was changed to green, with the front light flashing as well, in order to contrast with the lights of the city. All through the life of the station the channel was constantly being dredged and widened, and eventually the decision was made to expand to the east as well as west. Therefore, in 1966 the decision was made to tear down the lights. Members of the Green Bay Yacht Club petitioned the Corps of Engineers to be allowed to remove and preserve the towers. In November of that year the lights were moved to the parking lot of the club. Much of Grassy Island was removed, with a new automated beacon erected on what remains. In 1998 the two towers were relocated to a breakwater at the edge of the yacht club property, and they were put through a lengthy restoration, being rededicated in 2005. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places that year.

This game was not officially licensed by Nintendo and was manufactured using either non-standard light blue or black cartridges, typical of all games published by Color Dreams. Story Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu title screen The player plays as Master Chu. The Hindu god Shiva has cursed the village where Chu resides. Chu's friend Master Hu has failed to stop Shiva and has resorted to drinking. Chu must set out to stop Shiva and his minions. Despite Hu being a drunk, in 2 player mode, Chu and Hu can play simultaneously. Gameplay The game has 10 levels, or rounds, as they are called in the game. In the first seven rounds, the player must collect eight symbols of harmony (which resembled red and white yin-yang symbols) scattered throughout the area. Some symbols are hidden and may be found by shooting certain objects in the level. Successfully finding all eight symbols will transport the player to the level's boss. After beating the boss, the player must then find the Flaming Key of Freedom hidden in the boss's room to proceed to the next round. In rounds eight and nine, the player simply fights a boss three times and is awarded the key. In round ten the player fights two more bosses with Shiva in the background and, after defeating them, Shiva is fought. Successfully defeating Shiva wins the game. Both Chu and Hu have similar attributes. The player may fire shots of energy with the A button and can use a fan with Chu or knife with Hu with the B button that can defend against certain projectiles (so, in order to jump, they press up on the D-pad). The player may find various items that can restore health, grant invincibility, extra lives, or increase the number of shots fired. There are numerous enemies and obstacles in the levels that harm the player. If the player has the item that increases the number of shots, being harmed by anything will downgrade this item. When all lives are lost, the game is over, but the player may continue an infinite number of times. Continuing on any rounds past seven will take the player back to the start of round seven. Reception Allgame's Skyler Miller described the game as unplayable due to some obvious bugs.

Description  The Altuna Runestone is a granite stone in height that was discovered in 1918 by a local historian in the wall of a chapel located near its current location. Before the historical significance of runestones was recognized, they were often used as materials in the construction of roads, bridges, walls, and buildings. It is one of few surviving runestones with exclusively pagan illustrations from Norse mythology. Most surviving runestones were raised during the 11th century after the Christianization of Sweden, and they were raised by people who wanted to show that they too adhered to the new faith, at least outwardly so, due to the fact that at least half of the runestones have inscriptions related to Christian. One side of the Altuna Runestone, however, illustrates a legend recorded in the Hymiskvi√∞a of the Poetic Edda, in which the Norse god Thor fishes for J√∂rmungandr, the Midgard serpent. Thor goes fishing with the j√∂tunn Hymir using an ox head for bait, and catches J√∂rmungandr, who then either breaks loose or, as told in the Gylfaginning of the Prose Edda, the line is cut loose by Hymir. The Prose Edda provides the additional detail that while Thor was pulling on the line with J√∂rmungandr on the hook, his feet went through the bottom of the boat. The image on the Altuna Runestone does not show Hymir, which may be due to the narrow shape of the stone, but it shows Thor, his line and tackle and the serpent, and notably, Thor's foot which has been pushed through the hull of the boat. This encounter between Thor and J√∂rmungandr seems to have been one of the most popular motifs in Norse art. Three other picture stones that have been linked with the myth are the Ardre VIII image stone, the H√∏rdum stone, and the Gosforth Cross. pp. 122-23. A stone slab that may be a portion of a second cross at Gosforth also shows a fishing scene using an ox head. The runic inscription suggests that those to whom the stone is dedicated, the father Holmfastr and his son Arnfastr, were burned, possibly in a case of arson known as quickfire, a method commonly used in Scandinavian feuds. Arnfastr and his brother V√©fastr share the common name element fastr with their father, Holmfastr. A common practice at that time in Scandinavia was the repeating of one of the name elements from a parent's name in the names of the children to show the family connection. p. 750. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The inscription is signed by the runemasters with the normalized names Fr√∂sten and Balle and perhaps by Livsten. Balle was active in south-western Uppland and northern S√∂dermanland during the second half of the eleventh century.

The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 123. It is about five miles south of Leamington Spa, near the villages of Harbury and Lighthorne. Parish The parish of Chesterton and Kingston includes the agricultural area of Kingston east of the village. The parish forms a roughly rectangular block, nearly four miles in length from north-west to south-east and two miles broad. It is home to the notable Chesterton Windmill, built in 1632 from a design attributed to Inigo Jones, just off the Fosse Way and a Grade I listed building. The altitude of the parish ranges from 64 metres in the west to 122 metre in the eastChesterton's entry on the British History Online website being mainly rolling low hills but slightly flatter where the Fosse Way dissects it. History There was a Roman town on the Fosse Way less than a mile from the present village of Chesterton and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village changed names many times being Cestreyon (1043), Cestedone (1086), Cestertona (1170), Templer Cestreton (1185), Chastreton (1198), Casterton (1292) and Chesterton by 1350. The parish church dedicated to St. Giles, is thought to date back to the 12th century, the most recent update being in 1862. Parish records held at Warwick Records Office date back to 1538. At one time the church served the settlement of Chesterton. This settlement disappeared as a result of the inhabitants moving away to Chesterton Green, after receiving a visit from that most unwelcome of itinerants, the plague. Local rumour has it that tunnels connect the church to nearby Humble Bee cottages. In 1642 the Parish was merged with the neighbouring one of Kingston, to be renamed Chesterton and Kingston.Noden, Dorothy A: The History of Chesterton and Kingston, page 66. Avon Litho Ltd, 1978 Since the 1350s much of the village had been in the possession of the Peyto family who lived at Chesterton House. Chesterton House was demolished in 1802The house's entry on the Our Warwickshire website after Margaret Peyto, last of the family, died in 1772 and left her estates to her cousin John Verney of nearby Compton Verney. The remains of the walls and gateway still stand. As well as being involved in the building of the windmill Sir Edward Peyto probably built the nearby watermill which started off as a court house but was converted to a mill in 1634. The stream supplying the mill pond created flooding problems so now no longer tops it up. In the 1960s an attempt to clear the pool failed, killing all the fish and making it stagnant. It was many years before the pool recovered and now as maximum dimensions of 315 by 105 metres.Noden, Dorothy A: The History of Chesterton and Kingston, page 38.

Ferranti positioned Orion to be their primary offering during the early 1960s, complementing their high-end Atlas and smaller systems like the Sirius and Argus. The Orion was based on a new type of logic circuit known as \\"Neuron\\" and included built-in multitasking support, one of the earliest commercial machines to do so (the KDF9 being a contemporary). Performance of the system was much less than expected and the Orion was a business disaster, selling only about eleven machines. The Orion 2 project was quickly started to address its problems, and five of these were sold. Its failure was the capstone to a long series of losses for the Manchester labs, and with it, Ferranti management grew tired of the entire computer market. The division was sold to International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), who selected the Canadian Ferranti-Packard 6000 as their mid-range offering, ending further sales of the Orion 2. History =Magnetic amplifiers= During the 1950s transistors were expensive and relatively fragile devices.Scarrott Although they had advantages for computer designers, namely lower power requirements and their smaller physical packaging, vacuum tubes remained the primary logic device until the early 1960s. There was no lack of experimentation with other solid state switching devices, however. One such system was the magnetic amplifier. Similar to magnetic core memory, or \\"cores\\", magnetic amplifiers used small toroids of ferrite as a switching element. When current passed through the core a magnetic field would be induced that would reach a maximum value based on the saturation point of the material being used. This field induced a current in a separate read circuit, creating an amplified output of known current. Unlike digital logic based on tubes or transistors, which uses defined voltages to represent values, magnetic amplifiers based their logic values on defined current values. One advantage to magnetic amplifiers is that they are open in the center and several input lines can be threaded through them. This makes it easy to implement chains of \\"OR\\" logic by threading a single core with all the inputs that need to be ORed together. This was widely used in the \\"best two out of three\\" circuits that were widely used in binary adders, which could reduce the component count of the ALU considerably. This was known as \\"Ballot Box Logic\\" due to the way the inputs \\"voted\\" on the output. Another way to use this feature was to use the same cores for different duties during different periods of the machine cycle, say to load memory during one portion and then as part of an adder in another. Each of the cores could be used for as many duties as there was room for wiring through the center. In the late 1950s new techniques were introduced in transistor manufacture that led to a rapid fall in prices while reliability shot up. By the early 1960s most magnetic amplifier efforts were abandoned. Few machines using the circuits reached the market, the best known examples being the mostly-magnetic UNIVAC Solid State (1959) and the mostly transistorized English Electric KDF9 (1964).Bill Findlay, \\"The Hardware of the KDF9\\", 2009 =Neuron= The Ferranti Computer Department in West Gorton, Manchester had originally been set up as an industrial partner of Manchester University's pioneering computer research lab, commercializing their Manchester Mark 1 and several follow-on designs. During the 1950s, under the direction of Brian Pollard, the Gorton labs also researched magnetic amplifiers. Like most teams, they decided to abandon them when transistors improved. One member of the lab, Ken Johnson, proposed a new type of transistor-based logic that followed the same conventions as the magnetic amplifiers, namely that binary logic was based on known currents instead of voltages. Like the magnetic amplifiers, Johnson's \\"Neuron\\" design could be used to control several different inputs. Better yet, the system often required only one transistor per logic element, whereas conventional voltage-based logic would require two or more. Although transistors were falling in price they were still expensive, so a Neuron-based machine might offer similar performance at a much lower price than a machine based on traditional transistor logic. The team decided to test the Neuron design by building a small machine known as \\"Newt\\",Hall short for \\"Neuron test\\". This machine was so successful that the lab decided to expand the testbed into a complete computer. The result was the Sirius, which was announced on 19 May 1959 with claims that it was the smallest and most economically priced computer in the European market.Barbara Ainsworth, \\"The Ferranti Sirius at Monash University\\", Computer Resurrection, Number 44 (Autumn 2008) Several sales followed. =Orion 1= With the success of Sirius, the team turned its attention to a much larger design. Since many of the costs of a complete computer system are fixed - power supplies, printers, etc. - a more complex computer with more internal circuitry would have more of its cost associated with the circuits themselves. For this reason, a larger machine made of Neurons would have an increased price advantage over transistorized offerings. Pollard decided that such a machine would be a strong counterpart to the high- end Atlas, and would form the basis for Ferranti's sales for the next five years. Looking for a launch customer, Ferranti signed up Prudential Assurance with the promise to deliver the machine in 1960. However, these plans quickly went awry. The Neuron proved unable to be adapted to the larger physical size of the Orion. Keeping the current levels steady over the longer wire runs was extremely difficult, and efforts to cure the problems resulted in lengthy delays. The first Orion was eventually delivered, but was over a year late and unit cost was more than expected, limiting its sales. Between 1962 and 1964 the Computing Division lost $7.5 million, largely as a result of the Orion.Ball & Vardalas, pg. 254 =Orion 2= During the Orion's gestation it appeared there was a real possibility the new system might not work at all. Engineers at other Ferranti departments, notably the former Lily Hill House in Bracknell, started raising increasingly vocal concerns about the effort. Several members from Bracknell approached Gordon Scarrott and tried to convince him that Orion should be developed using a conventional all- transistor design. They recommended using the \\"Griblons\\" circuits developed by Maurice Gribble at Ferranti's Wythenshawe plant, which they had used to successfully implement their Argus computer for the Bristol Bloodhound missile system.Gribble Their efforts failed, they turned to Pollard to overrule Scarrott, which led to a series of increasingly acrimonious exchanges. After their last attempt on 5 November 1958, they decided to go directly to Sebastian de Ferranti, but this effort also failed. Pollard resigned about a month later and his position was taken over by Peter Hall. Braunholtz later expressed his frustration that they didn't write to him directly, and the matter sat for several years while Orion continued to run into delays. In September 1961 Prudential was threatening to cancel their order, and by chance, Braunholtz at that moment sent a telegram to Hall expressing his continuing concerns. Hall immediately invited Braunholtz to talk about his ideas, and several days later the Bracknell team was working full out on what would become the Orion 2. By the end of October the basic design was complete, and the team started looking for a transistor logic design to use for implementation. Although Braunholtz had suggested using the Griblons, the Bracknell group also invited a team of engineers from Ferranti Canada to discuss their recent successes with their \\"Gemini\\" design, which was used in their ReserVec system. On November 2 the Bracknell team decided to adopt the Gemini circuitry for Orion 2.See \\"SOME KEY DATES\\", GroupMaurice Gribble claims that his design was used for the basis of both the Orion 2 and the FP-6000. However, Ball and Vardalas state that the design was Canadian and quote one of the engineers to that end.(pg. 254) Parts arrived from many Ferranti divisions over the next year, and the machine was officially switched on by Peter Hunt on 7 January 1963. The first Orion 2 was delivered to Prudential on 1 December 1964, running at about five times the speed of the Orion 1. Prudential bought a second machine for the processing of industrial branch policies. Another system was sold to the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society in Cape Town where it was used for updating insurance policies. A fourth was sold to Beecham Group to upgrade its Orion 1 system.System The original prototype was kept by ICT and used for software development by the Nebula Compiler team. By this point, however, Ferranti was already well on the road to selling all of its business computing divisions to ICT. As part of their due diligence process, ICT studied both the Orion 2 and the FP-6000. Ferranti's own engineers concluded that \\"There are certain facets of the system we do not like. However, were we to begin designing now a machine in the same price/performance range as the FP6000, we would have in some 18 months' time a system that would not be significantly better -if indeed any better- than the FP6000.\\"Campbell-Kelly, pg. 222 ICT chose to move forward with the FP-6000 with minor modifications, and used it as the basis for their ICT 1900 series through the 1960s.Vardalas Existing contracts for the Orion 2 were filled, and sales ended. Description Although the Orion and Orion 2 differed significantly in their internals, their programming interface and external peripherals were almost identical. The basic Orion machine included 4,096 48-bit words of slow, 12Œºs, core memory, which could be expanded to 16,384 words. Each word could be organized as eight 6-bit characters, a single 48-bit binary number, or a single floating-point number with a 40-bit fraction and an 8-bit exponent. The system included built-in capabilities for working with Pound sterling before decimalization.System, pg. 8 The core memory was backed by one or two magnetic drums with 16k words each.System, pg. 18 Various offline input/output included magnetic disks, tape drives, punched cards, punched tape and printers. Most of the Orion's instruction set used a three- address form, with sixty-four 48-bit accumulators. Each program had its own private accumulator set which were the first 64 registers of its address space, which was a reserved contiguous subset of the physical store, defined by the contents of a \\"datum\\" relocation register. Operand addresses were relative to the datum, and could be modified by one of the accumulators for indexing arrays and similar tasks. A basic three-address instruction took a minimum of 64 Œºs, a two-address one 48 Œºs, and any index modifications on the addresses added 16 Œºs per modified address. Multiplication took from 156 to 172 Œºs, and division anywhere from 564 to 1,112 Œºs, although the average time was 574 Œºs. The Orion 2, having a core store with a much shorter cycle time, was considerably faster. A key feature of the Orion system was its built-in support for time-sharing. This was supported by a series of input/output (I/O) interrupts, or what they referred to as \\"lockouts\\". The system automatically switched programs during the time spent waiting for the end of an I/O operation. The Orion also supported protected memory in the form of pre- arranged \\"reservations\\". Starting and stopping programs, as well as selecting new ones to run when one completed, was the duty of the \\"Organisation Program.\\"System, pg. 16 The Orion was one of the earliest machines to directly support time-sharing in hardware in spite of intense industry interest; other time-sharing systems of the same era include LEO III of 1961, PLATO in early 1961, CTSS later that year, and the English Electric KDF9 and FP-6000 of 1964. The Orion is also notable for the use of its own high-level business language, NEBULA. Nebula was created because of Ferranti's perception that the COBOL standard of 1960 was not sufficiently powerful for their machines, notably as COBOL was developed in the context of decimal, character-oriented batch processing, while Orion was a binary word-oriented multiprogramming system. NEBULA adapted many of COBOL's basic concepts, adding new ones of their own.A. Rousell, \\"A progress report of NEBULA\\", The Computer Journal, Volume 5 Number 3 (1962), pg. 162-163 NEBULA was later ported to the Atlas as well.

Segal (born 1951) is an American evolutionary psychologist and behavioral geneticist, specializing in the study of twins. Early years and education Nancy L. Segal was born Boston, Massachusetts, in 1951. She received a B.A. from Boston University (Psychology, with Honors and English Literature, double major, 1973), M.A. from University of Chicago (Division of Social Sciences, 1974), and was awarded a Ph.D. from University of Chicago (Committee on Human Development, 1982). Career Segal is the Professor of Developmental Psychology and Director of the Twin Studies Center, at California State University (CSU), Fullerton. She was recognized as CSU Fullerton's 2004-5 Outstanding Professor of the Year, as well as the 2004-5 Distinguished Professor in Humanities and Social Sciences. Segal also received the 2005 James Shields Award for Lifetime Contributions to Twin Research from the Behavior Genetics Association and International Society for Twin Studies. Segal is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, American Psychological Society and Western Psychological Association. She has been inducted into the Collegium of Distinguished Alumni at Boston University. Segal is an Associate Editor for the journal, Twin Research and Human Genetics, was Contributing Research Editor for Twins Magazine from 1984‚Äì1998, and is a member of the Advisory Board for the Center for Loss in Multiple Birth. She served as Assistant Director of the Minnesota Center for Twin and Adoption Research, in the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota, 1985‚Äì1991. She has appeared on Good Morning America, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Dateline NBC and the Today Show, in addition to other nationally and locally televised programs. Her research interests include genetic and environmental influences on human behavior, especially social relationships and bereavement. Her research program includes twin and adoption studies that are specially designed to address problems and issues concerning human development in general, and twin development in particular. =Research= Segal's main research focuses on human behavior and includes cooperation and competition, altruism, personal bonds, and bereavement. She studies twins to understand social relationships in the general population, hoping to derive implications for what makes people get along. She find that identical twins generally work together more cooperatively than others. In addition to studying identical twins (who result from the splitting of one egg fertilized by one sperm and who share all of their genes) and fraternal twins (who come from two eggs fertilized by different sperm and who share on average half their genes, just as non-twin siblings do), Segal is the only researcher known to study \\"virtual\\" or \\"pseudo\\" twins. These are two people less than nine months apart in age but with different biological parents, who are raised together from infancy. Her studies in progress show a modest degree of similarity in virtual twins for general intelligence and special mental abilities. Segal sees great promise in a related new area of research, epigenomics, which refers to natural chemical modifications that take place in individual genomes, marking them for increased or decreased activity. Over the years, Segal has served as an expert witness on legal cases involving twins, in particular, wrongful death, injury, medical negligence, and custody. A paper reporting this work was published in a special issue of the journal Law and Human Behavior. Additional details about this area of study appear in her book, Entwined Lives. Each year, Segal offers a seminar on behavior genetics and evolutionary psychology to graduate students in the Department of Psychology at CSU Fulleron. She has sponsored undergraduate and graduate research projects involving original twin research designs and methods. Personal life Segal has a fraternal twin sister, Anne. Selected works =Books= Segal's book, Born Together-Reared Apart: The Landmark Minnesota Twin Study, was published by Harvard University Press in June 2012. It surveys the origins, methods, findings and controversies from the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart. Another of her books is Someone Else's Twin: The True Story of Babies Switched at Birth, published in 2011 by Prometheus. It tells the story of identical twin girls born in Spain's Canary Islands, one of whom was accidentally exchanged for a singleton infant. The twins were reunited at age twenty-eight. The book also includes research on twins reared apart and information on several other switched at birth twin cases. Segal is also the author of Indivisible by Two: Lives of Extraordinary Twins (Harvard University Press). This collection of essays on twelve twin, triplet and quadruplet sets brings together humanity and science in a unique way. She is also the author of Entwined Lives: Twins and What They Tell Us About Human Behavior (E. P. Dutton, 1999). This survey of twins and twin research includes chapters on the biology of twinning, twin research methodology, findings on intelligence, personality, mental disorders and athletic prowess, studies of twin relationships, information on twins raised apart, findings on \\"pseudo-twins\\" or same-age unrelated children raised together, non-human twinning, new fertility treatments, life histories of noteworthy twins, legal issues involving twins, conjoined twins and a survey of nature-nurture issues. With G. E. Weisfeld and C. C. Weisfeld, Segal is the co-editor of Uniting Psychology and Biology: Integrative Perspectives on Human Development (American Psychological Association Press, 1997). This book, which resulted from a festschrift in honor of her mentor Professor Daniel G. Freedman at the University of Chicago, brings together a series of current papers on behavioral-genetic, ethological, cultural and evolutionary approaches to human behavior. =Articles and essays= Segal's papers have appeared in journals, such as American Psychologist, Child Development and Science.

For most of the 20th century, it manufactured railway air braking, signalling, mining & colliery equipment, industrial automation and power rectifier equipment in the engineering works in Chippenham, Wiltshire, England and Melbourne, Australia. There were associate companies in South Africa (Saxby & Farmer Private) and India. The company's main factory of around 35 acres was located immediately north-east of Chippenham railway station on the Great Western Railway.A Hundred Years of Speed with Safety: The Inception and Progress of the Westinghouse Brake & Signal Co. Ltd., 1881-1981, Publisher: Polunnio 2014, . There were also factories in Kingswood, Bristol (Douglas Ltd ‚Äì formerly Douglas Motorcycles then Douglas Vespa and vehicle air brake equipment), Hobbs Automatic Transmissions (epicyclic gearbox), Westcode Semiconductors (now IXYS Corporation) The main factory was east of Foundry Lane, Signal & Automation design offices as well as Brake Engineering, drawing offices and design/test laboratories on island site shared with Hugh Baird & Sons, Maltsters and the Wiltshire Bacon Company. The Rectifier Design Department was at Derriads House, some design offices opposite the main factory site, other test & development laboratories beyond the semiconductor site at Avon House, north of the main factory site. On-site manufacturing capability covered every part of the engineering spectrum other than electron beam welding. There were acres of machine shops containing almost every variety of machine tool, extensive press shops, iron and non-ferrous foundries together with pattern shop and core shop, extensive drop-stamp forge, die- casting shops and tool room, tin-smiths' shop, copper oxide and selenium rectifier shops, electro-plating shop. The assembly and erection shops included wiring shops for signalling equipment, rectifier equipment, colliery equipment, railway signaling relays. The list is almost endless. Support activities included a well-equipped and staffed medical centre and apprentice training school and hostel. Apprentices fell into Trade, Craft, Student and Graduate categories. The company had a works restaurant (overalls allowed), a staff restaurant (smartish dress), and a directors' restaurant, all of which were supplied from the company allotments outside the north gate (now a housing estate). There was an immense amount of innovative work done. To name a few things, railway vacuum brakes, numerous mechanical, electrical and electronic signalling innovations. The company pioneered the use of S.G. Iron (spheroidal graphite) for crank shafts and other items (followed in this by Ford U.K.) and was the first to produce an all-electronic control & monitoring system (Westronic, in various \\"styles\\") initially for the railway market but then extending into oil, water, gas, electricity and sewage. Predecessors and background The railway air brake was patented in the United States of America by George Westinghouse in 1869 (straight air brake) and 1872 (automatic air brake), see Westinghouse Air Brake Company. Predecessors of the British company included Evans O'Donnell Limited and Saxby and Farmer. Saxby and Farmer was started by John Saxby and John Stinson Farmer in the mid-19th century as pioneers in the manufacture of railway signalling equipment. In 1875 Saxby and Farmer had developed a mechanical linked braking system, which connected vehicles to brake simultaneously. In 1920, Saxby, Farmer and Evans O'Donnell formed the Westinghouse Brake & Saxby Signal Company Ltd. History Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd formed part of BTR plc who acquired it from the Hawker Siddeley group in 1992. In 1999, BTR merged with Siebe plc to form BTR Siebe plc, later renamed Invensys. The detailed history of the company from 1881 to 1981 was recorded in O.S. Nock's final book, 'A Hundred Years of Speed with Safety', not published until 2006 ‚Äì many years after Nock's death. Nock, a prolific writer of railway books and magazine articles for many years, was the chief mechanical engineer for Westinghouse until his retirement in 1970. A second book, Westinghouse Brake & Signal in Photographs 1894 to 1981, was published by polunnio.co.uk in 2010, this not-for-profit project raising funds for the Chippenham Museum & Heritage Centre which holds a significant collection of documents and artefacts about the company. Other documentation is held at the Swindon & Wiltshire History Centre in the town. Successors Invensys quickly split the company into Westinghouse Signals Ltd and Westinghouse Brakes Ltd, selling Westinghouse Brakes to Munich-based competitor Knorr-Bremse.Invensys investor relations news release, 25 April 2000 Invensys Sells Westinghouse Brakes to Knorr- Bremse. Retrieved from the Internet Archive on 30 March 2008. Also formerly a part of The Westinghouse Brake & Signal Company is Westcode, a high-power semiconductor manufacturer, now part of the IXYS Corporation. On 2 May 2013, the acquisition of Invensys Rail by Siemens was successfully completed. On 1 July 2013, the new company name for Invensys Rail Limited became Siemens Rail Automation Limited, with Westinghouse Brake & Signal Holdings becoming Siemens Rail Automation Holdings Limited. With this, the Westinghouse name disappeared from the railway signalling industry. Several years later, Siemens announced that it planned to merge its rail assets, including the former Westinghouse Signal business, with Alstom.

Completed in July 1942, she spent the majority of her career patrolling the waters off Norway in the North Sea, then was sent to the Pacific but was forced back due to technical problems. After three uneventful patrols in the North Sea, the boat conducted one patrol in the Bay of Biscay, attacking two surfaced German u-boats with torpedoes, but missed. The submarine then participated in Operation Source, an attempt to sink German battleships in Norway threatening allied Arctic convoys. Sea Nymph was assigned to tow the midget submarine X8 to off the fjord where the was anchored. While at sea, X8 was scuttled due to technical issues, and the mission was cancelled. The submarine was then tasked with transporting British agents to a fishing vessel off Norway. In her next two patrols, the boat fired torpedoes on three German merchant ships, but missed every attack. In March 1944, Sea Nymph was sent to the United States for a refit; she returned in October, then after an uneventful patrol, she had her battery changed. With Nazi Germany close to defeat, the submarine was ordered to the Pacific, where war with the Japanese was also ongoing. She had to turn back and have her battery replaced again after encountering problems; after arriving in the Philippines, on 13 July Sea Nymph caught on fire and was damaged beyond the repair capabilities of local shipyards. She was sent back to Great Britain, but as the war with Japan ended, she was not repaired but placed in reserve. Sea Nymph was scrapped in Troon, Scotland in June 1948. Design and description Schematic drawing of a S-class submarine The S-class submarines were designed to patrol the restricted waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The third batch was slightly enlarged and improved over the preceding second batch of the S-class. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged.Akermann, p. 341 The S-class submarines had a crew of 48 officers and ratings. They had a diving depth of .McCartney, p. 7 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Bagnasco, p. 110 On the surface, the third batch boats had a range of at and at submerged. The boats were armed with seven 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. A half-dozen of these were in the bow and there was one external tube in the stern. They carried six reload torpedoes for the bow tubes for a grand total of thirteen torpedoes. Twelve mines could be carried in lieu of the internally stowed torpedoes. They were also armed with a 3-inch (76 mm) deck gun.Chesneau, pp. 51‚Äì52 It is uncertain if Sea Nymph was completed with a Oerlikon light AA gun or had one added later. The third-batch S-class boats were fitted with either a Type 129AR or 138 ASDIC system and a Type 291 or 291W early-warning radar.Akermann, pp. 341, 345 Construction and career Sea Nymph was a third-batch S-class submarine and was ordered by the British Admiralty on 2 September 1940. She was laid down in the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead as P 73 on 6 May 1941 and was launched on 29 July 1942.Akermann, p. 339 On 1 November 1942, P 73, under the command of Lieutenant Geoffrey D. N. Milner, sailed to Holy Loch, where she was commissioned two days later as HMS Sea Nymph. The submarine was named after mythical sea creatures, Nereids; she was the second ship with this name.Akermann, p. 347 =Northern patrols= After going through training exercises off Scapa Flow and Holy Loch, Sea Nymph set sail on 16 December 1942 for an anti-submarine patrol off Norway. The patrol was uneventful, and the boat returned to port on 2 January 1943. On 15 February 1943, Sea Nymph departed Lerwick for another war patrol in the North Sea, but returned on 11 March having sighted no targets. From 20 March to 9 April, the boat conducted another patrol in the same area, but was again unsuccessful. After torpedo and gunnery exercises of the River Clyde area, the boat commenced another patrol in the Bay of Biscay, west of France on 28 June. On 13 July, she sighted two German submarines, U-592 and U-669, and fired a full spread of six torpedoes at them, but missed. The boat returned to port of 22 July. From 3 to 20 August, Sea Nymph conducted another uneventful war patrol in the Bay of Biscay. =Operation Source= Tirpitz in the Ofotfjord/Bogenfjord On 31 August 1943, Sea Nymph conducted training at Port HHZ, Scotland with midget submarines in preparation for Operation Source, an attack on the German battleships in Norway using midget submarines. On 11 September 1943, the boat departed port towing the X-class submarine X8 to her target, the .Grove, p. 127Akermann, p. 455 An auxiliary crew was on board during the passage, which was meant to switch with the operational crew near the target. On 15 September, Sea Nymph lost her tow with X8. After one day of searching, X8 was found and taken under tow again. Two days later however, the midget submarine was found to be incapable of submerging due to technical issues and was scuttled. Sea Nymph returned to Lerwick on 8 October. =Arctic patrols= After an uneventful patrol in the Arctic from 15 November to 7 December 1943, Sea Nymph was ordered to transport British agents and equipment from Shetland to off Norway, where they would be transferred to a local fishing vessel. She landed the agents successfully on 7 January 1944, then returned to port on the 10th. On the 16th, she departed again for another war patrol off Norway. After unsuccessfully attacking a German merchant ship and its escort on the 25th, she returned to Lerwick on the 30th. From 2 to 21 February, the boat underwent maintenance, then left for another patrol in northern waters. On 1 March, she unsuccessfully fired four torpedoes at the German merchant ship Jupiter and her two escorts. Two days later she attacked the German merchant ship Levante, but again missed with all four torpedoes. The submarine returned to Lerwick on 8 March. =Later career= On 25 March 1944, Sea Nymph departed Great Britain for the USA, where she was due to refit at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. After a stop at Argentia, then Halifax, Nova Scotia, the boat underwent her refit between 19 April and 16 September. On 11 October, she returned to Holy Loch and underwent additional training, then the submarine went on another patrol from 6 to 17 January 1945 in the Norwegian Sea in search of German u-boats. After having her battery changed during February in Elderslie, Scotland, Sea Nymph was reassigned to the Pacific theater of operations, arriving at Gibraltar on 22 March. However, upon reaching Aden, the boat developed problems with her battery and was sent back to Port Said in Egypt for repairs. From 2 to 16 May, she had her battery replaced, then she sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, passing through Trincomalee and arriving on 28 June. While alongside the submarine depot ship HMS Maidstone on 13 July, Sea Nymph caught on fire. A damage assessment concluded that she had to be sent home for repairs, as local dockyards could not perform the task. After temporary repairs allowing her to get underway, she departed Subic Bay and made the trip back to Great Britain, arriving on 30 October 1945. During her return, the war with Japan had ended, and Sea Nymph was not repaired but placed in reserve. In June 1948, the boat was sold for scrap metal at Troon, Scotland.

Luttrell became a SO1 by the end of his eight-year career in the United States Navy. Luttrell co-hosts After Action, a TV show in which former special operations veterans talk about issues in the United States. Glenn Beck is the executive producer of the show, which airs on TheBlaze. Early life and education Luttrell was born in Houston, Texas, on November 7, 1975. He began training for the U.S. Navy SEALs at the age of 14, with U.S. Army veteran Billy Shelton, who lived near Luttrell's home. Luttrell trained every day with his twin brother, Morgan, and others who aspired to join the U.S Navy and other special operations forces. Shelton trained them using various weight and endurance exercises. After high school at Huntsville High, Huntsville, Texas, Luttrell attended Sam Houston State University where he was a member of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 1998 he graduated with a B.S in International Business. Career alt=A color image of six military personnel dressed in their combat uniforms and holding weapons. =United States Navy= Luttrell enlisted in the U.S. Navy in March 1999. After graduating from boot camp and Hospital Corpsman A-school, he transferred to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Class 226. However, due to a fractured femur he suffered from falling off a rope, he graduated with Class 228 on April 21, 2000. After completing BUD/S, Luttrell attended Army jump school and SEAL Qualification Training (SQT). Luttrell earned his Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) and Naval Special Warfare Insignia on February 2, 2001 after completing SQT. He was then sent to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for the Special Operations Combat Medic (SOCM) course. SOCM was an additional six months of advanced training in conventional and unconventional medical skills, ranging from diagnosis and treatment of many conditions to advanced emergency medicine and battlefield life support.SEAL of Honor: Operation Red Wings and the Life of Lt. Michael P. Murphy, USN by Gary Williams (pg. 135) He was deployed to Iraq with SEAL Team 5 on April 14, 2003, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, to root out and destroy leftover Iraqi resistance and joined in the search for WMDs. Afterward, he carried out operations to eliminate or capture terrorists. He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2005 with SEAL Team Ten as part of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One (SDV-1). While in Afghanistan, he was involved in Operation Red Wings, during which the four-man Special Reconnaissance element with SDV-1 was discovered by local herdsmen, subsequently ambushed, and all killed except Luttrell. Luttrell was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the operation. The team knew the local herdsmen might reveal their whereabouts to Taliban fighters but, because they were not armed combatants, the team allowed the herdsmen to leave despite the risk to themselves and their mission. During the ambush of Operation Red Wings the four SEALs were attacked from three sides and took fire from RPK machine guns, AK-47s, RPG-7s, and 82mm mortars. The attack forced the SEALs into the northeast gorge of the Shuryek Valley side of Sawtalo Sar. The SEALs made a number of attempts to contact their combat operations center with a PRC-148 MBITR (Multi Band Inter/Intra Team Radio) and then with an Iridium satellite phone. They could not establish consistent communication, however, other than for a period long enough to indicate that they were under attack. Three of the four team members were killed, and Luttrell, the only survivor, was left unconscious with a number of fractures, a broken back, and numerous shrapnel wounds. Members of SEAL Team 10 attempted a rescue during the firefight, but their helicopter was shot down, and all aboard were killed. Luttrell regained consciousness and evaded the pursuing enemy, with the help of local Pashtun villagers, one of them being Mohammad Gulab, who eventually sent an emissary to the nearest U.S. base to secure Luttrell's safe rescue and ultimately saved his life. The target of Operation Red Wings, Mohammad Ismail alias Ahmad Shah, survived the American operation but was killed during a firefight with Pakistani police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in April 2008. After recovering from his injuries, Luttrell returned to active duty and deployed to Ramadi during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, as part of SEAL Team Five. He later had his knees blown out and fractured his spine again. These injuries ultimately led to his discharge. =Navy Cross= In 2007, Luttrell was awarded the Navy Cross by President George W. Bush. The Navy Cross citation text states: alt=Navy Cross ribbon The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in actions against the enemy while serving in a four-man Special Reconnaissance element with SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE, Naval Special Warfare Task unit, Afghanistan from 27 to 28 June 2005, in the vicinity of Asadabad, Konar Province, Afghanistan. Operating in the middle of an enemy-controlled area, in extremely rugged terrain, his Special Reconnaissance element was tasked with locating a high-level Anti-Coalition Militia leader, in support of a follow-on direct action mission to disrupt enemy activity. On 28 June 2005, the element was spotted by Anti-Coalition Militia sympathizers, who immediately revealed their position to the militia fighters. As a result, the element directly encountered the enemy. Demonstrating exceptional resolve and fully understanding the gravity of the situation and his responsibility to his teammates, the unidentified SEAL fought valiantly against the numerically superior and positionally advantaged enemy force. By his undaunted courage in the face of heavy enemy fire, and absolute devotion to his teammates, Petty Officer Luttrell will long be remembered for the role he played in the Global War on Terrorism. Petty Officer Luttrell's courageous and selfless heroism reflected great credit upon him and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. =Returning home= Luttrell returned to the U.S. in 2007 and co- authored the New York Times bestseller Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10. A film version, starring Mark Wahlberg, was released on December 25, 2013. In 2007, Luttrell was medically discharged from the Navy. In 2009, he was granted a medical retirement through the Board for the Correction of Naval Records. In May 2012, Little, Brown and Company released Luttrell's latest book, co-authored with James D. Hornfischer, Service: A Navy SEAL at War. Lone Survivor Foundation In 2010, Luttrell established the Lone Survivor Foundation. The mission of the foundation, headquartered in Houston, Texas, is to \\"restore, empower, and renew hope for our wounded warriors and their families through health, wellness, and therapeutic support.\\" The vision is to \\"provide exceptional therapeutic, outdoor, and unique opportunities that optimize recovery and healing of affected American wounded service members and their families.\\" Luttrell and The Lone Survivor Foundation partnered with The Boot Campaign to help show tangible appreciation of America's active-duty military, raise awareness of the challenges they face upon return, and support the transition home. Personal life Marcus (left) and twin brother Morgan Luttrell, with Vice President Mike Pence Luttrell married Melanie Juneau on November 27, 2010, in Texas. Their son Axe, named after fallen SEAL comrade Matthew Axelson, was born on May 8, 2011. On January 14, 2012, at an event for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Luttrell announced that he and his wife were expecting their second child. Their daughter, Addie, was born on August 26, 2012. Luttrell's twin brother Morgan Luttrell is also a retired Navy SEAL; he left the Navy with the rank of lieutenant. Luttrell endorsed the 2016 presidential campaign of former Texas governor Rick Perry and was present, alongside his twin brother Morgan, at Perry's formal announcement on June 4, 2015. Luttrell spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in support of Donald Trump. Operation Red Wings controversy There is some conflict over the exact number of Taliban forces involved in the engagement. Luttrell filed an official after-action report in which he estimated the size of the Taliban force to be around 20‚Äì35. He claims in his book that his team were told in their briefing that around 80 to 200 fighters were expected to be in the area. Initial intel estimates were approximately 10 to 20. Official media reports from the military estimated that the Taliban force was around 20 as well, while the Navy cited 30‚Äì40 enemies in the Medal of Honor citation for LT Michael P. Murphy. In the Summary of Action related to the same Medal of Honor, the Navy cites an \\"enemy force of more than 50 anti-coalition militia\\". Ed Darack cites a military intelligence report in his book Victory Point: Operations Red Wings and Whalers, stating that the Taliban force was 8‚Äì10, compared to the 80‚Äì200 claimed by Luttrell in Lone Survivor. The military intelligence estimate cited by Darack is based on research from intelligence reports and aerial and eye-witness studies of the battlefield after the fact, including the men sent in to rescue Luttrell, as well as reports from Afghan intelligence. Luttrell claimed in Lone Survivor that Lieutenant Murphy considered executing the unarmed civilians who stumbled upon the SEAL reconnaissance team and even put it to a vote, but this has been criticized and dismissed by many as fiction. Navy Special Warfare Command spokesman Lieutenant Steve Ruh stated that \\"the senior guy ultimately has the ultimate authority\\" for making decisions in the field. He also stated that \\"this is the first time I've ever heard of anything put to a vote like that. In my 14 years of Navy experience, I've never seen or heard of anything like that.\\" Michael P. Murphy's father claims in the June 12, 2007 article \\"Survivor's book dishonors son's memory\\" in Newsday that his son would never have considered executing unarmed civilians, let alone putting such a grave decision up for a vote. Military protocol and rules of engagement strictly forbid harming unarmed non-combatant civilians. NOTE: Original not available, but cached at the site \\"Shadowspear\\". Mohammad Gulab, the Afghan villager who rescued Luttrell, also disputes Luttrell's version of the story. Luttrell claims that he fired off nearly all of his rounds, but Gulab said that he was found with all 11 magazines of ammunition. Gulab also said that the Taliban heard the helicopter drop off the SEAL team, then tracked their footprints. When the Taliban found them, they were debating about what to do with the herdsmen, so they held back. After they released them, the Taliban decided to attack. Gulab claims that the locals heard the firefight, searched the hills afterward, and found no Taliban corpses. Andrew MacMannis is a former Marine Colonel who helped plan the mission and was on location for the recovery operation, and he says that there were no reports of any enemy casualties. Two videos that the Taliban shot during the firefight only show 7 men in Ahmad Shah's militia. Gulab claims that he was never given the chance to tell his side of the story, and that his interpreter before a 60 Minutes interview told him, \\"Whatever Marcus says in the interview, say yes.\\" In popular culture =Films= *In the film Lone Survivor (2013), Luttrell was portrayed by actor Mark Wahlberg. Luttrell makes a significant cameo appearance (uncredited) in at least three scenes in the film and is present in other scenes, as well. He first appears as one of the SEALs, referred to as \\"Frankie\\" by Lt. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), lightheartedly hazing rookie SEAL Shane Patton (Alexander Ludwig) before the mission, jokingly giving Shane his first mission or \\"op\\" of cleaning the table, supplemented by knocking over a drink. His second appearance is during the presentation of the rules of engagement for Operation Red Wings where he can be seen shaking his head at the rules governing return fire. This scene is significant. In his book, Lone Survivor, Marcus explains extensively how these rules created substantial risk for the forces in Afghanistan. His third appearance is later in the film as one of the 16 special operators aboard the doomed Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Luttrell and his team. The camera stops on him and several real-life SEALs just before the Taliban's rocket-propelled grenade comes through the open rear bay door and impacts the Chinook's interior, killing everyone aboard. \\"I was on the other side of the mountain when those guys came to help me,\\" Luttrell says of his real-life experience, \\"so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me.\\" * Luttrell had a brief role in the veteran funded movie Range 15. =Literature= *In his book American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History (2012), Chris Kyle says he and fellow Navy SEAL Luttrell were friends, and Kyle encourages his readers to also read Luttrell's book, Lone Survivor. =Television= *Luttrell appears in a Season 9 episode of the A&E; series Duck Dynasty, visiting West Monroe, Louisiana to honor two wounded Marines for their service. *Luttrell appears in Season 9 episode 3 of the Discovery series Overhaulin', having a '67 Ford Mustang built to honor his service. *Luttrell appeared in a speech at the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016.

She is named in honor of Andrew Broaddus (1900-1972), a former mayor of Louisville (1953-1957). Her historic purpose was to protect travelers on the Ohio River from the Falls of the Ohio, with rescue crews for those who fell victim to the rapids. Louisville was the first place where a lifesaving station was placed in western waters. The first lifestation in Louisville was in 1881, with Mayor Andrew Broaddus as the third. A National Historic Landmark, she is the only surviving floating lifesaving station of the US Life-Saving Service. Predecessor On 22 October 1881, Life Saving Station#10 was placed in service at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky, the most dangerous place on the entire Ohio River. Skilled rivermen, who had served here as volunteers, became personnel of the Service. Built at the Howard Shipyards (now part of Jeffboat) at Jeffersonville, Indiana, the station boat was the first on America's Western Rivers system. It served until being replaced in 1902 by another wooden hull boat. The second vessel was replaced in 1929 with the present steel-hulled boat with its distinctive watchtower. In addition to her primary role in providing aid and rescue to river travelers, LSS#10 also served notably during World War II, when Coast Guard Reservists ran patrols from the station to guard against possible acts of German sabotage. Earlier, Station personnel also assisted in the enforcement of Prohibition by transporting Federal agents to remote islands in the Ohio River to search for illicit alcohol operations. From 1881 to 1972, the Life Saving Service, and later the Coast Guard, patrolled the Falls area, rescuing rivermen and passengers, saving stranded boast and cargoes, recovering victims of drowning, and performing heroic action during Ohio River floods. Station records reveal that between 1881 and 1915, 7000 lives and property worth $6 million were saved by the crews of LSS#10. History Mayor Andrew Broaddus was built in 1929 in Dubuque, Iowa. She has a steel hull, and is long, a beam of , a Hold Depth of , at 623 Net Tons. She has two decks, and a lookout tower. She has much of her original interior fabric, and is considered in good condition. Mayor Andrew Broaddus is the only floating lifestation and the last inland waterway lifestation for the United States Coast Guard still in existence, and one of the few reminders that the U.S. Life-Saving Service ever existed. Mayor Andrew Broaddus currently serves as an adjunct to Belle of Louisville, also a National Historic Landmark. Mayor Andrew Broaddus provides office space for Belle of Louisville. In the Spring of 2007, Mayor Andrew Broadduss hull was damaged by a commercial ship. In November, she was towed to Jeffboat for repairs. A museum within the boat was planned for the future in 2007.

Economic importance Nematode becomes a concern to farmers when the number feeding on the roots exceeds a certain threshold, above which the plant is unable to grow normally. This threshold varies according to the species of nematode. For Pratylenchus zeae, because the level exceeds in many fields in Australia so that P. zeaeis considered the primary nematode. Where the number of nematode individual exceeds 100 per 200 gram pre planting soil or above 200 per 250 gram soil or 1 gram dry roots at mid- season, there are a significant reduction of sugarcane yield.Stirling G.R and Blair, B. A guide to sugar cane diseases (2000). CIRAD Publication Service Montpellier, France, pp 299-305. The economic damage from lesion nematodes is often underestimated because above-ground symptoms are not always obvious. No recent data are available regarding damage caused by these pathogens to this crop, but it is known that controlling them raises yields by between 8% and 40%, depending on the species of nematode and hybrid planted. Management Nematode assays need to be done before stepping on any managements later. Threshold for plant and first ratoons (per gram of roots) is 300 while threshold for old ratoons (per gram of roots) is over 900. Crop rotation with legume plants on sugarcane fields can reduce the number of plant parasitic nematodes. However, this management has a temporary effect because a high concentration of these nematodes will be resurged within a year of growing fields.Stirling, G.R., Wilson, E.J., Stirling, A.M., Pankhurst, C.E., Moody, P.W. and Bell, M.J (2003).Organic amendments enhance biological suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes in sugarcane soils.

The Utah Children's Justice Center (CJC) is a program of the Utah Attorney General's Office to coordinate investigation and prosecution of child abuse, especially child sexual abuse. There are 22 CJC's in the state of Utah. They were created to provide a child friendly environment for interviews and exams of child victims as well as to provide support and centralized resource referrals to victim's families. Services Prior to the creation of the Utah CJC's, investigation of child abuse may have required a child victim to be interviewed by police, social services, medical personnel, psychologists and prosecutors. The primary function of the CJC is to provide a facility where children can feel more comfortable and receive coordinated services as part of the investigative process. The interviews are completed in a home-like setting by law enforcement and/or social service investigators. The interview is recorded so representatives from all involved agencies are able to use the interview in their investigation. The children's justice center provides many secondary services. These include: *Medical forensic exams on-site at some centers *Tracking and monitoring of cases through the criminal justice system *Collaboration of resources among agencies involved in the investigation *Community education presentations *Referrals for mental health and other services Locations Utah has 22 justice centers where child victims can be interviewed in a safe child-friendly environment.

Cilento is known as one of the centers of Mediterranean diet. Geography The coast of Cilento is located on the Tyrrhenian Sea, stretching from Paestum to the Gulf of Policastro, near the town of Sapri. Most of the touristic destinations in the coast are frazioni (hamlets) of comuni whose seats are inland; examples include Santa Maria di Castellabate, Acciaroli, Velia, Palinuro, Marina di Camerota, Scario and Policastro Bussentino. The inner boundaries are the Alburni mountains and Vallo di Diano, sometimes considered as part of Cilentan geographical region, which has in Sala Consilina its largest center. The most important towns in this area are Vallo della Lucania (in the middle), Sapri and Agropoli: this is the largest town of Cilento and the principal harbour. Most of this area is included in \\"Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park\\".

Velia was also the seat of \\"Eleatics\\", a school of pre-Socratic philosophers as Parmenides, Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos). Cilento comes by the Latin word Cis Alentum, meaning \\"On this side of the Alento\\". Cis Alentum: The origin of the name \\"Cilento\\" =Sixth province of Campania= In the 1990s it was proposed to make Cilento a new province of Campania. Information about the new province This proposal has never come near to implementation; in particular there was the difficulty of choosing an administrative centre. The four candidates were Vallo della Lucania (in the most central position), Agropoli (the largest town, situated in the north), Sala Consilina (the most populous town of Vallo di Diano) and Sapri (in the centre of southern Cilento, with the most important railway station). Another more recent proposal was to move Cilento from Campania to Basilicata, as a third province Article on Corriere della Sera together with the existing provinces of Potenza and Matera. National Park In a great part of the territory of Cilento and Vallo di Diano there was instituted, on 1991, a national park, to better share Italy's best kept secret to the world and to encourage tourism of a high quality. In 1998 the park became a World Heritage Site of UNESCO. Coast The Cilentan Coast, or Costiera Cilentana in Italian, is a stretch of coastline situated in the gulfs of Salerno and Policastro, extending in 16 municipalities; from Capaccio-Paestum in the north-west to Sapri in the south- east. Language Cilento was part of ancient Lucania, and its language is influenced by Lucanian. In the north of Cilento the dialect is more influenced by Neapolitan, but in the south it has many similarities with Sicilian. Cilento DOC Italian wine, both red, white and rose, under the Cilento DOC appellation comes from this area. Grapes destined for DOC product must be harvested to a maximum yield of 12 tonnes/hectare with the finished red wines fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 11.5% and the whites and roses fermented to 11%.P.

He is best known for his roles in the reality shows Rob & Big, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory and Ridiculousness. He also is the creator of the animated series Wild Grinders, in which he voices the series' main character, Lil Rob. In 2014, Dyrdek was labeled as one of the \\"most influential skateboarders of all-time\\" by FoxWeekly. Early years Dyrdek was born on June 28, 1974 in Kettering, Ohio to Gene and Patty Dyrdek. Dyrdek was involved in sports as a child and began skateboarding at the age of 11, when he received his first skateboard from professional skateboarder Neil Blender. Of his early interest in the sport, Dyrdek has stated, \\"I was so focused on becoming a pro skateboarder. I would sit in school and think about all the tricks I was going to do, then I‚Äôd get out of school and skate until they made me come inside.\\" Professional skateboarding =Alien Workshop= At the age of 12, Dyrdek acquired sponsorship from the same company that Blender was a team member of and began his skateboarding career. A few years later, Dyrdek and Blender quit their board sponsor and created Alien Workshop. At the age of 16, Dyrdek decided to forgo his senior year of high school and instead moved to Southern California to continue with his professional skate career. He would later acquire the company himself during his post-riding career as an entrepreneur. =DC Shoes= Soon after moving to California, Dyrdek began to ride for Droors Clothing, a company that was then transformed into DC Shoes. which sponsored Dyrdek until 2016. Both Droors and DC were founded with the involvement of highly regarded skateboarder Danny Way and, in the lead-up period for the release of the 2012 Way documentary Waiting for Lightning. He was sponsored and worked with DC Shoes from 1995 until January 2016. =Other sponsors= Dyrdek has been sponsored by Silver Trucks (a company that he helped establish in 2003), EA Skate, and Monster Energy.

The league offered the highest overall purse in the history of the sport, at $1.6 million for its championship event broadcast on ESPN in 198 countries. The league also partnered with the Boys and Girls Club of America to develop new skate parks in California. The organization was also the focus of Dyrdek's documentary film The Motivation, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Film and television Dyrdek first starred in the MTV reality series, Rob & Big (aired November 2006 to April 2008), with his best friend and bodyguard Christopher \\"Big Black\\" Boykin, as well as his cousin, Chris \\"Drama\\" Pfaff and friend Rashawn \\"Bam Bam\\" Davis. In February 2009, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory, featuring Dyrdek, Pfaff, and his Dyrdek Enterprise staff, was first broadcast. It covered Dyrdek's \\"Fantasy Factory\\", a converted warehouse where Dyrdek runs his businesses. He also built a music studio for his cousin Pfaff inside the factory. During the course of the first season, he also opened his first SafeSpot SkateSpot. At the grand-opening, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa rode with Dyrdek on the world's largest skateboard. Fantasy Factory aired a total of seven seasons, with the season finale airing on March 13, 2014.

An experimental aircraft, it was expected to be used to examine Tupolev's ideas and to help the Soviets understand the use of metal in aircraft manufacturing. Design and development The ANT-1 was Tupolev's first aircraft and was built from metal, wood, and aluminum. Aluminum was used in the wing partitions and ribs, the vertical and horizontal tailplanes, and a few other smaller areas. The other weight carrying elements were made of wood, with linen fabric covering the fuselage and wings. Operational history The ANT-1 was first flown at Ekaterininskaya Square, now Krasnokazarmenaya Street. It was flown frequently over the next two years for tests. It was then stored in the assembly workshop ‚Äì in the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was hung from the ceiling. However, with the disruptions to the bureau caused by World War II, it had disappeared by the time the war ended. The precise fate of the prototype is unknown, though it is likely that it was destroyed by the Germans in their advance to Moscow in the summer of 1941, along with other Tupolev aircraft.

Established in 2014, the association assigns each school to one of three leagues in a system of promotion and relegation for a two-year period. (Oaks Christian and St. Bonaventure joined the Marmonte League for football only in 2010, predating the association's founding.) During the April 2019 releaguing process in the CIF-SS Northern Area, administrators of area schools approved the following plan that takes effect in 2020, with leagues listed in order of strength from greatest to least: Marmonte League * Calabasas High School * Grace Brethren High School * Oaks Christian High School * Westlake High School Canyon League * Agoura High School * Oak Park High School * Royal High School * Simi Valley High School * Thousand Oaks High School Camino League * Bishop Diego High School * Camarillo High School * Moorpark High School * Newbury Park High School * St. Bonaventure High School Sports The Marmonte League sponsors the following sports: =Fall season= * Football (11-man) * Cross country * Boys' water polo * Girls' golf * Girls' tennis * Girls' volleyball =Winter season= * Basketball * Soccer * Wrestling * Girls' water polo =Spring season= * Baseball * Boys' golf * Lacrosse * Softball * Swimming/Diving * Track and field * Boys' tennis * Boys' volleyball History =Early years= The Marmonte League was established in 1970. Originally, the league consisted of six schools in Los Angeles and Ventura counties: Canyon, Hart, Newbury Park, Oxnard, Royal, and Simi Valley high schools. =Westlake frosh/soph girls' basketball perfect season= In the 2009-2010 girls' basketball season, the Westlake frosh/soph team finished with a perfect record of 21-0 overall and a 14-0 in the Marmonte League. The team won its own Westlake Winter Invitational Tournament as well as the Camarillo Winter Classic. Coach Nick Kindel was selected as the 2010 F/S Marmonte League Girls Basketball Coach of the Year. =Denial of Derrick Brown transfer= In 2011, the CIF-SS and the Marmonte League denied Derrick \\"Deejay\\" Brown a hardship transfer request that would have allowed him to play basketball at Thousand Oaks High School. TOHS coach Richard Endres had become Brown's guardian. The student-athlete from Brooklyn, New York was a victim of domestic violence in 2009, when his stepfather attempted to kill both him and his mother. At the hearing to determine Brown's eligibility, principals of Marmonte League schools barred Endres from speaking or arguing on behalf of Brown. \\"They don't like it that he's living with me\\", said Endres, regarding Marmonte principals. =Westlake boys' basketball forced forfeit= On January 5, 2012, the CIF-SS required Westlake's varsity boys' basketball team to forfeit a win over Agoura. The Marmonte League victory was ruled invalid due to the fact that Westlake's junior varsity coach, John Elliot, sat on the varsity bench after having been ejected in the preceding junior varsity game. The ruling came despite the fact that the game official approved Elliot's presence at the varsity contest. =2014 releaguing and Coastal Canyon League spinoff= Plans to revamp the entire Northern Area of the CIF Southern Section, which includes the Marmonte League, were in place for 2014. Those plans were quashed when Oaks Christian and St. Bonaventure high schools challenged the plan that would have them move out of Ventura County-based leagues into a league consisting of parochial schools in Los Angeles County. In March 2013, the two schools each won their appeal, allowing them to remain in local leagues. In April 2014, a new plan was approved that added Adolfo Camarillo and Oak Park highs to the league, then split the Marmonte League into two circuits, one of which would retain the Marmonte name. The newly created league later was named the Coastal Canyon League. St. Bonaventure remained in the Tri-County Athletic Association for all sports except football.

Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866‚Äì1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. It was formed in K√∂nigsberg in March 1816 as a Troop Brigade (Truppen-Brigade).G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815‚Äì1939.

From the corps' formation in 1820, the division was subordinated in peacetime to I Army Corps (I. Armeekorps).Wegner, p. 43. The 1st Division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The 1st Division and its regiments fought in the Austro-Prussian War against Austria in 1866, including the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935) The division then fought in the Franco-Prussian War against France in 1870‚Äì71. Its regiments saw action in the Battle of Noisseville, the Battle of Gravelotte, the Siege of Metz, the Battle of Amiens, the Battle of Hallue, and the Battle of St. Quentin, among other actions.Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle In World War I, the division initially served on the Eastern Front, seeing action at the battles of Stallup√∂nen, Gumbinnen, and Tannenberg, and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. The division then fought in the Battle of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and in the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive of 1915. In March 1916, the 1st Infantry Division was transferred to the Western Front. One month later, it entered the Battle of Verdun. After several months' hard fighting around Fort Vaux, the division was withdrawn from the line and returned to the Eastern Front, where it arrived in August 1916. It then participated in the invasion of Romania, which had entered the war in 1916 on the Allied side. The division returned to Verdun at the end of 1917. In 1918, it took part in the Spring Offensive, which the Germans referred to as the Kaiserschlacht, the Second Battle of the Marne, and the Battle of the Hindenburg Line.1\\\\. Infanterie-Division 1870 organization During wartime, the 1st Division, like other German divisions, was redesignated an infantry division. The organization of the 1st Infantry Division in 1870 at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War was as follows:A.

During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, the engineer contingent was increased, and a divisional signals command was created.

Other common names include the iris nematode, the potato tuber eelworm and the potato tuber nematode. It is an endoparasitic, migratory nematode commonly found in areas such as the United States, Europe, central Asia and Southern Africa.  Disease cycle  Potato rot nematodes are microscopic worms approximately 1.4 millimeters long. Their life cycle takes place inside potato tubers where they eat starch grains. This causes the affected tissues to become brown and powdery, and the surface of the tuber becomes covered with dark patches with dry cracking skin. The nematodes live inside the living tissue where they aggregate rapidly as the fecund females each produce up to 250 eggs. They survive in stored tubers during the winter and can infect the stolons of planting material. After infection, the nematodes move throughout the plant tissue producing a pectinase enzyme, which causes cell degeneration and is the main causal agent of the rot observed. The soil plays only a secondary role in the transfer of this nematode.AgroAtlas The life cycle of Ditylenchus destructor lasts approximately 6 days. As Ditylenchus destructor is an endoparasite, a majority of the life cycle occurs inside the host tissue. There are four molting periods and juvenile stages of development for Ditylenchus destructor with the first juvenile stage occurring within the egg. Females deposit eggs inside the tuber from their ovaries at which point the embryos begin undergo a cleavage process, beginning the first juvenile stage. Two and a half hours later the juvenile nematode can be seen through the egg wall, and 48 hours later the first larval stage has completed and hatching occurs. Hatching marks the molting into the second juvenile stage, and development continues until the next molting. In the third juvenile stage the sexual structures begin to develop and become visible. This development of additional structures causes large amounts of growth and elongation is seen in the nematode (especially in females who have more development occur). It is in the fourth stage where the sexual structures fully develop: vaginal development in females and testes development in males. At this point the nematodes undergo their final molting and enter the final, adult stage in their life cycle. After feeding on a host for some time, the females lay eggs inside the tuber, the eggs are fertilized by a male, and the cycle repeats. As an migratory, endoparastie, Ditylenchus destructor females lay eggs throughout the plant tissue while moving from cell to cell. Once they have hatched, the juvenile nematodes will either move throughout the surrounding plant tissue or out of the plant from which they hatched to a nearby, healthy host. Ditylenchus destructor is not very mobile through soil though, so dispersal primarily occurs during harvest or transportation of the host when healthy tubers are in the immediate vicinity. If the nematodes exit the initial host, they most commonly infect the tubers of a new host; however, it is sometimes possible for them to infect the above ground parts of the plant and migrate to the tubers through the plant cells. Environment Unlike other nematodes, Ditylenchus destructor does not have a resting form, so environmental conditions have a large impact on the habits of the organism. The most optimal conditions for the nematodes are soils that are around 28 ¬∞C. Temperatures above or below this range will inhibit the movement and life cycle of the nematode; therefore, the 28 ¬∞C range provides optimal growth conditions. Moist soils are also especially favorable for the development of the nematode as well as its movement through the soil. Given these conditions, the most opportune locations for Ditylenchus destructor are in midwestern and southern North America as well as central parts of Europe and Asia. In these areas, agricultural practices also largely influence the spread of the pathogen. When harvesting and transporting tubers, moving them in large piles allows the nematodes to move from an infected tuber to surrounding healthy ones, encouraging the spread of disease. Hosts and Symptoms In addition to potatoes, potato rot nematodes have a wide range of over 100 species of hosts from numerous families. Some of these include alfalfa, beets, carrots, garlic, hops, mint, parsnips, peanuts, rhubarb, tomatoes, and flowering plants such as irises and tulips. The nematodes only attack the below ground, non-aerial tissues of plants such as the roots, bulbs, rhizomes, and tubers. The main symptoms of Ditylenchus destructor, common to potatoes and its other hosts, are the rotting and discoloration of subterranean plant tissue. In potatoes, early infection can be detected by small white spots underneath the potato‚Äôs skin. As the disease progresses, these spots become larger and darker with a spongy or hollow appearance. Tubers develop sunken areas and the skin becomes dry, cracked, and detached from the underlying flesh. There is further discoloration at this stage that is often due to secondary invasions of fungi, bacteria, and free-living nematodes. Above ground symptoms are usually not seen, although heavily infected plants are often weaker, smaller and can have curled or discolored leaves. Symptoms of Ditylenchus destructor on the bulbs of flowering plants such as irises and tulips are similar to those of potatoes, except infection usually occurs at the bulb‚Äôs base and moves upwards. The fleshy scales develop discolored yellow to black lesions, the roots become blackened, and leaves can develop yellow tips. Potato rot nematodes in groundnuts, such as peanuts, develop blackened hulls, shrunken kernels, and embryos with a brown discoloration. Potato rot nematodes are identified and diagnosed by various morphological and molecular methods. The morphological methods are the primary means of diagnosis, with molecular methods being used for when there is a low level of infestation or when only juveniles are present. Nematodes are extracted from infected plant tissue and examined microscopically for distinguishing characteristics such as body and stylet, and tail morphology. Molecular methods for identifying Ditylenchus destructor (especially in distinguishing from other Ditylenchus species) include PCRs (polymerase chain reactions) to find restriction patterns of DNA to identify specific species. Management Management of Ditylenchus destructor can be achieved through various methods of preventative and chemical control. Once the nematodes have been established, they are very difficult to eradicate because of the wide range of other hosts on which they can survive. Therefore, preventative measures are generally the first means of control for potato rot nematodes. Planting materials and locations free of these nematodes is crucial, so the soil, seeds, and farm machinery must all be carefully controlled. This is done by disinfecting machinery and removing all potentially infected plant debris from farm equipment when transferring from field to field. Seeds certified to be free of Ditylenchus destructor should be planted. Crop rotation as a form of control is difficult due to the nematodes‚Äô wide host range; therefore, non-host crops must be selected carefully to use for rotation each season. Weeds must also be eradicated, as they often act as alternative hosts for potato rot nematodes. Chemical control of Ditylenchus destructor can be achieved with soil-applied nematicides such as carbofuran, ethylene dibromide, VAPAM HL, and TELONE. Fumigation with these nematicides is often paired with mechanical measures to attain optimal control. For example, Wisconsin has eradicated these nematodes from potatoes by repeated use of ethylene dibromide and restricting the movement of infected tubers. Another management method was demonstrated by the control of potato rot nematodes in garlic. The seeds were coated with thiram or benomyl wettable powder before being planted, resulting in very good control of the disease. Importance Ditylenchus destructor can reproduce at high rates and cause large amounts of damage to hosts and so can be very damaging to a cash crop. One of the most important impacts of Ditylenchus destructor is in South Africa, where it caused major disease amongst the peanut plantations in the early 1990s. In fields where the nematodes have been found, between 40% and 60% of the peanuts had large amounts of symptoms which heavily damaged the production levels. Similarly, the same issues were observed in Sweden in the 1970s when Ditylenchus destructor was found in their potato fields. In this instance it caused disease in between 40% and 70% of the potatoes being grown in the field where the pathogen was found. Finally, one of the more severe cases of the disease was found in Estonia in the 1960s. In this case the nematodes were only found on about 6% of the potato farms but on these farms between 70% and 90% of the potatoes exhibited severe symptoms. This high rate of disease caused immense damage to the fields that were infected and a large amount of crops were lost. There have also been instances where the nematodes have affected areas within the United States as well. Since 1953, Wisconsin has had to quarantine multiple areas after finding Ditylenchus destructor in local potato fields. The pathogen has also been seen in Idaho where it was a major concern initially, as potatoes are a major state crop. Other states that have had Ditylenchus destructor issues include Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. Fortunately, the United States has used very stringent control laws to avoid any widespread or major damage similar to that seen in the past. The complete list of countries that have been affected by Ditylenchus destructor include Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, United States, Haiti, Ecuador, Peru, Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Span, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Characterization of two races of stem and bulb nematode (Ditylenchus dispaci) in Israel, 1990. 18: 229-232 It is commonly known as the stem nematode, the stem and bulb eelworm, or onion bloat (in the United Kingdom).Ditylenchus dipsaci at European and Mediterranean Plant Protection OrganizationDitylenchus dipsaci at Nemaplex, University of California Symptoms of infection include stunted growth, discoloration of bulbs, and swollen stems. D. dipsaci is a migratory endoparasite that has a five-stage lifecycle and the ability to enter into a dormancy stage. D. dipsaci enters through stomata or plant wounds and creates galls or malformations in plant growth. This allows for the entrance of secondary pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. Management of disease is maintained through seed sanitation, heat treatment, crop rotation, and fumigation of fields. D. dipsaci is economically detrimental because infected crops are unmarketable. Morphology and biology D. dipsaci is a microscopic worm about 1.5 mm long. It penetrates into plants from either the soil or infested planting material and occasionally from seeds. They live between the cells of onion or garlic leaves and between the scales of the bulbs where they feed on cell sap and multiply. The female lays 250 eggs during a season and six generations may develop under optimum conditions when the temperature is in the range 15‚Äì20 ¬∞C. As the number of nematodes increase, symptoms become visible. Onion leaves start to curl, garlic leaves become yellow and die, bulb scales are loosened, and bulb necks become cracked. Development continues in infested bulbs during storage. D. dipsaci is not restricted to onions and garlic. Its other plant hosts include peas, beetroot, vegetable marrow, pumpkin, rhubarb, and ornamental bulbs. Some weeds also act as hosts, including Stellaria media, Linaria vulgaris, Polygonum aviculare, Fallopia convolvulus, and Galium aparine.AgroAtlas Lifecycle Stem and bulb nematodes are migratory endoparasites. Their lifecycle occurs in five stages with the first molt occurring in the egg and the second and third molt occurring in the soil. By the fourth stage, juveniles have entered the plant through young tissue and/or seedlings. The fourth molt then occurs inside the plant.Quador, Motiul and Nambiar, Lila.

The adult female must mate with a male to reproduce and lay eggs. A complete reproductive lifecycle of the stem and bulb nematode is 19‚Äì25 days (egg to egg). Reproduction takes place in succulent, rapidly growing tissues or in storage organs and continues throughout.Bridge, John, Starr, James L. Plant Nematodes of Agricultural Importance. 46-47. Manson Publishing. London. 2007. A female can lay 200‚Äì500 eggs in her lifespan. However, if conditions are unfavorable, the nematodes can halt their lifecycle. The lifespan of stem and bulb nematodes is about 70 days.Khan, Aslam. Plant Diseases. 210-214. Kalpaz Publications. India. 2001. Most generations are passed inside bulbs, stems and leaves. Eggs and larvae overwinter in dried infected host material.Lucas George B., C. Lee Campbell, Leon T. Lucas. Introduction to Plant Disease: Identification and Management, Second Edition. 150-151. Kluwer Academic Publishers. Massachusetts 2001. They are also found in weed hosts and seeds of composite.Horst, R. Kenneth. Westcott‚Äôs Plant Disease Handbook, 7th Edition. 392-393. Springer Dordrecht, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York. 2008. Stem and bulb nematodes can survive up to two years in freezing or extremely dry environments in the soil. D. dipsaci can survive on or in plant tissue by entering cryptobiosis and survive for 3‚Äì5 years in this stage. During dormancy, D. dipsaci shows no sign of life and the metabolic activity is almost at a standstill. Distribution and environment D. dipsaci is one of the most devastating plant parasitic nematodes in the world. Its races are very diverse and found in most temperate areas of the world, including Europe and the Mediterranean region, North and South America, northern and southern Africa, Asia, and Oceania, but are not usually found in tropical regions. If an infestation occurs, it can commonly kill 60‚Äì80% of the crop. The suitable environment is between 15 and 20 ¬∞C and moisture is required for movement. Disease cycle Stem and bulb nematodes are migratory endoparasites and can be spread through irrigation water, tools and animals. When the plants are covered in a film of moisture, D. dipsaci can move upwards to new leaves and stems. They enter through stomata or wounds. D. dipsaci feeds on the parenchymatous cells of the cortex once inside the plant. They release an enzyme, pectinase, that dissolves the cell walls. Once D. dipsaci begins to feed on the plant, cells near the head of the nematode lose all or a portion of their contents. The cells surrounding these begin to divide and enlarge. This develops into a gall or malformation of the seedling. This opening allows secondary pathogens to enter such as bacteria and fungi. Favorable entry of young seedlings in the soil occurs through the root cap or from inside the seed. The plant cells become enlarged due to the disappearance of chloroplasts and an increase of intracellular spaces in parenchyma tissue. Once the bulbs enlarge, D. dipsaci migrates down the stem. This causes the stem to become puffy and soft due to cavities, which can lead to collapse. D. dipsaci only enters the soil again if conditions become unfavorable. Hosts and symptoms D. dipsaci has an extensive host range. Major damage occurs in garlic, onion, carrot, fava bean, alfalfa, oats, and strawberry. Ornamental plants can also be infected including hyacinth and tulip. It is estimated that this pathogen infects 400‚Äì500 plant species worldwide. In Allium species (onions, garlic, and leeks), infected plants show characteristic symptoms including stunted growth, yellow spots, leaf curl, and foliage lesions. Stems often have swollen regions called ‚Äúspikkles.‚Äù As adult nematodes migrate into the scales of the bulb, and the scales become soft, grey, and loosely packed. Highly infected bulbs can also split apart or show malformed bloating. The leaves of the plant become flaccid and may collapse. This can lead to defoliated plants. Agrios, G. N. \\"Plant Pathology. 4t h Ed.\\" Fitopatolog√≠a (1997) pp. 858-861 Garlic shows similar symptoms of leaf yellowing and stunted bulbs. When harvested, the infected garlic may be missing portions of the root system. In fava beans (Vicia faba), symptoms of infection include reddish-brown stem lesions that can turn black. Young bean pods are dark-brown. Infected seeds are smaller and distorted compared to healthy beans. Speckles and spots are also commonly seen on infected fava beans. Up to 30 biological races occur within D. dipsaci that are mostly distinguished by their host preferences. Very little morphological differences are seen between the races which makes diagnosis difficult.Vanstone, V. & Russell, J. Pathogen of the Month-March 2011, 2011, Date accessed October 24, 2012, www.appsnet.org/publications/potm/March2011%20POTM.pdf Seed material samples from infected plants can be dissected and viewed under a microscope to confirm the correct race. Management Several different methods are currently used to reduce the presence and destruction of D. dipsaci. Infection can be prevented by ensuring that only clean seeds and bulbs are planted.Celettie, Michael; Clarke, Tom; Potter, John. Bulb and Stem Nematode in Onions and Carrots. Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2000. http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-043.html#control. Bulbs and seeds can be disinfected by hot-water treatments. Soaking them in 110 to 115 ¬∞F water with formalin, a formaldehyde solution, for two to three hours can successfully kill nematodes.Courtney, Wilbur. Nematodes in Bulbs. Science in Farming Library for Farming. United Kingdom. Library4farming.org. Proper sanitation in fields and of tools is essential in preventing and controlling the spread of D. dipsaci, because they can survive and reproduce in infected plants and residues. The fourth-stage juvenile is the most resilient and can survive repeated desiccation or drying and recover upon rehydration.McKenry, M.V. and P. A. Roberts. 1985. Phytonematology Study Guide.

All infected tissues should be removed from growing sites and destroyed to control populations, and all farm tools and equipment should be cleaned of potentially contaminated soil before moving them to a new location. Races of D. dipsaci are highly host-specific, so employing a three-year crop rotation can deprive the nematodes of a suitable host and starve the population. Because some weeds serve as hosts for nematodes, controlling weeds in fields decreases the number of susceptible hosts and the ability of the nematodes to survive and spread. The time a susceptible host crop is planted also infects the severity of nematode damage. Cooler temperatures and lower humidity can suppress the reproduction and infestation rates of D. dipsaci. Growers should avoid planting susceptible bulbs, seeds, or seedling during seasons of peak nematode infection. Soil fumigation in fields during fall can control nematodes on a susceptible crop in the spring. A nematicide fumigant that is specific to the genus Ditylenchus should be used. Selectively fumigate only the regions of the fields that are infected to ensure that the high cost of fumigating does not mitigate the economic gain from saving crops from nematode damage. Fumigants are usually applied before planting and subsequently after emergence. Importance Nearly 450 different plant species are susceptible to D. dipsaci due to the vast number of races. Many of these plants are economically valuable food crops and ornamentals and cannot be sold if they are infected or damaged by stem and bulb nematodes. D. dipsaci is especially important economically because the damage it can cause renders the plants unmarketable. Crops such as onions and carrots cannot be sold because the products are infected and damaged. Other crops such as alfalfa, oats, and tulips that are not used primarily for their roots still suffer necrosis and stunting that slowly destroys the plant. Seeds, bulbs, or saplings infected with nematodes often do not survive to maturity and are worthless.

The earlier songs on this compilation were recorded when Taylor was only eighteen. The songs are most often bitter or outright angry love songs or simply songs of longing. The songs have many layers of guitar effects, which gives what are somewhat recognizable Southern blues roots a dark psychedelic edge. Some of the homemade recordings on Lion found their way into the hands of David Shouse, who then asked the much younger Taylor to join his new band, which would later become known as The Grifters. Though Taylor was originally reluctant to use his Hot Monkey material in a band format, \\"Nothin' At All\\" would be recorded with A Band Called Bud, while \\"Need You\\" and \\"Another Song\\" would end up on the first two Grifters EPs.

For example, entertainment and sports trendsetters promote status brands such as Armani, Prada, Triple 5 Soul, and Billionaire Boys Club. Trendsetters need not be famous, but media promotion often cements a brand's popularity.

In 1875 a British engineer bought the patent rights of the Pulsometer and it was introduced to the market soon thereafter. The invention was inspired by the Savery steam pump invented by Thomas Savery. Around the turn of the century, it was a popular and effective pump for quarry pumping.  Construction and operation  This extremely simple pump was made of cast iron, and had no pistons, rods, cylinders, cranks, or flywheels. It operated by the direct action of steam on water. The mechanism consisted of two chambers. As the steam condensed in one chamber, it acted as a suction pump, while in the other chamber, steam was introduced under pressure and so it acted as a force pump. At the end of every stroke, a ball valve consisting of a small brass ball moved slightly, causing the two chambers to swap functions from suction-pump to force-pump and vice versa. The result was that the water was first suction pumped and then force pumped. A good explanation can be found in the 1901 article referenced below: > The operation of the pulsometer is as follows: The ball being at the > entrance of the left-hand chamber, and the right-hand being full of water, > steam enters, pressing on the surface of the water, and forcing it out > through the discharge passage. A rapid condensation of steam occurs from > contact with the water and with the walls of the chamber, previously cooled > by the water. When the water level has reached the horizontal edge of the > discharge passage, a large volume of steam suddenly escapes and is at once > condensed by the relatively cold water between the chamber and the discharge > valve. The pressure in the chamber quickly decreases; it cannot be sustained > by steam from the boiler, for, in accordance with the inventor's first > specifications, the steam pipe is small. If now the pressure in the left > chamber is equal, or nearly equal, to that in the right, friction caused by > the rapid flow of steam past the ball will draw the ball over and close the > right-hand chamber. Cut off from further supply, the steam, in contact with > water, begins to condense; a jet of cold water from the discharge pipe > spurts up through the injection tube, and by breaking into spray against the > side of the steam space, completes the condensation. The partial vacuum > produced brings water through the suction valve to fill the chamber; but at > the same time the air valve admits a little air, which passes up ahead of > the water and forms an elastic cushion to prevent the water from striking > violently against the steam ball. The air chamber is for the purpose of > preventing water-hammer in the suction pipe.  Advantages  The pump ran automatically without attendance. It was praised for its \\"extreme simplicity of construction, operation, compact form, high efficiency, economy, durability, and adaptability\\". Later designs were improved upon to enhance efficiency and to make the machine more accessible for inspection and repairs, thus reducing maintenance costs.  Detailed analysis  In the January 1901 issue of Technology Quarterly and Proceedings of the Society of Arts, an article appeared by Joseph C. Riley describing key operational details and technical evaluation of the pulsometer pump's performance. Riley noted that although somewhat inefficient, the pulsometer's simplicity and robust construction made it well suited to pumping \\"thick liquids or semi-fluids, such as heavy syrups, or even liquid mud\\".  Pulsometer Engineering Company Limited  Pulsometer Engineering Company Limited was founded in Britain in 1875 after a British engineer bought the patent rights of the pulsometer pump from Thomas Hall. In 1901 the company moved from London to Reading, Berkshire. In 1961 Pulsometer merged with Sigmund Pumps of Gateshead to form Sigmund Pulsometer Pumps. SPP Pumps Ltd became one of the largest pump company's in Europe. SPP Pumps Ltd is now part of Kirloskar Brothers Ltd.

The mountains are on the western periphery of the Phoenix metropolitan area, primarily flanked by the suburban cities of Buckeye to the southwest, and Surprise to the northeast. The mountain range is home to the White Tank Mountain Regional Park and is a regional recreation hub. The range, often referred to simply as the White Tanks, is a moderate-sized mountain range whose peaks rise to an elevation around . The range consists of a series of numerous ridges and canyons, and as such, lacks a single, prominent peak. The highest point in the range, at an altitude of , is Barry Goldwater Peak. The mountain range was formed through tectonic activities as part of a detachment fault sometime in the mid-Tertiary period, about 30 million years ago. As a fairly young (in geologic terms) mountain range, it has not been subject to the forces of erosion for long and retains an extremely rugged topography composed of rocky fault ridges and deep canyons. During seasonal heavy rainfall, accumulated water tends to rush rapidly through the steep canyons, over time scouring out a number of depressions or \\"tanks\\" in the white granite near the base of the mountains.

Biography David Bar-Hayim was born in Sydney, Australia. After moving to Israel in 1977, he initially studied in Yeshivat HaKotel, and subsequently in Merkaz Harav Kook in Jerusalem. He studied under Rabbi Moshe Zuriel, and received rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Yosef Kapach. For a number of years, Bar-Hayim taught Talmud, Halakha, and Jewish philosophy in Yeshivat Nahalath Tzvi. Bar-Hayim lives in Neve Daniel with his wife and eight children. Rabbinic career Bar Hayim lectures in the greater Jerusalem area, and publishes articles in English and Hebrew on various web sites. Though he is Orthodox, Bar-Hayim prefers the terms \\"Halakhic\\" or \\"Torah\\" Judaism, explaining that the term \\"Orthodox Judaism‚Äù is flawed by its very definition. Bar-Hayim has proposed the re-establishment of the customs of Israel, religious observances and practices that reflect those of the pre- exile Jewish communities in Israel, rather than those of Babylon or Europe. For this purpose, he has published a prayer book intended to reflect the original composition of early Israel, based upon the Jerusalem Talmud. Since 2001, Bar-Hayim has been working along with Machon HaYerushalmi to publish a new and elucidated edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. In 2006, Bar-Hayim founded the Shilo Institute for the research, elucidation, and dissemination of the Torah of Israel. Bar-Hayim established the Beth HaWa'ad rabbinical court to focus on actualizing the Torah of Israel and serve as an address for Gentiles, particularly the growing Noahide community.  Halachic rulings and positions  In light of the fact that Israel is yet again a sovereign Jewish state, with Jerusalem as its capital, Bar-Hayim has argued for increased utilization of the Jerusalem Talmud, which in his opinion, in regard to Torat Eretz Yisrael and Minhagei Eretz Yisrael, contains more lucid rulings than the Babylonian Talmud, which was given supremacy in \\"exile-mode\\" Judaism. This has led him to issue a number of highly controversial rulings, some of which are listed below: * In a very controversial ruling, Bar-Hayim has announced that any Jew worldwide, regardless of origin, and despite the practice of their forefathers, may eat kitniyot (\\"legumes\\") on Passover, as most Sefardi Jews do, for it is a practice rejected as an unnecessary precaution by some Halachic authorities as early as the time of its emergence.Tur, Orach Chaim 453 This position has been widely rejected by other rabbis, including Ovadia Yosef. * When the first day of Sukkot falls on Shabbat, Israeli Jews should follow the Mishna and Jerusalem Talmud's ruling, and perform the lulav ritual., (pdf) * Hallel should be recited on Israeli Independence Day. * Stainless steel utensils do not absorb dairy or meat, and may therefore just be washed with soap and water between dairy and meat use. * Bar-Hayim claims that the rulings of the Shulchan Aruch were intended as a resource and depiction of common practice in certain areas, and that the author never intended that his rulings become compulsory for Jewry. * The size of an olive in Jewish law is roughly the size of an olive. Those commentators who over- estimated the size of the olive were unfamiliar with olives, for they had lived in lands which lacked them. * The process of conversion to Judaism should be one that welcomes sincere converts and allows them the right to choose a rabbi and community which they identify with. * Jewish law requires one to follow the most convincing position which is truest to the sources. One need not uphold a tradition which can be shown to have been conceived in error. * The common form of reclining on Passover nowadays does not convey the aristocratic nobility it was intended to, and may often defeat its very purpose. * The main purpose of Torah study is to create a holy nation that obeys the law, and not merely withdrawn individuals seeking personal gain. * A blessing is to be recited when removing phylacteries. * One may eat poultry followed by dairy without a waiting period. * Torah sages can err, just as the Sanhedrin could (Leviticus 4:13). * Married women should wear a headNumbers 5:18 covering that is not a wig, since a wig is an invalid form of head covering. It is preferable for a married Jewish woman to expose her hair than to don a wig, for the wig actually increases attraction in the public domain and encourages the notion that Halakha is both irrational and intellectually dishonest. * One may change his nusach tefillah at any time, because the idea that a Jew should not change his nusach tefillah, and has to continue to pray in the way of his forefathers, is an invented Halacha of the galut (diaspora, \\"scattering, dispersion\\").

The Bedouin tribes adhere to Islam. From 1858 during Ottoman rule, the Negev Bedouin underwent a process of sedentarization which accelerated after the founding of Israel. In the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, most resettled in neighbouring regions. Between 1968 and 1989, Israel built seven townships in the northeast of the Negev for the Bedouin population, with about half of them relocating to these areas. Others remained in unrecognized villages, and while the Israeli government has gradually recognized some of them and taken measures to improve infrastructure and basic services, the majority are slated for destruction with the population facing forced displacement, as laid out in the Prawer Plan. According to human rights organizations opposed to the plan, it discriminated against the Bedouin population of the Negev and violated the community's historic land rights. In December 2013, the plan was rescinded. The Bedouin population in the Negev numbers 200,000-210,000. Just over half of them live in seven government-built Bedouin-only towns; the remaining 90,000 live in 46 villages ‚Äì 35 of which are unrecognized and 11 of which were officially recognized in 2003. Characteristics 1908 map of the Bedouin tribes Goats grazing in the township of Tel Sheva Tel Arad inhabited since 4000 BCE Negev Bedouin used to be nomadic and later also semi-nomadic Arabs who live by rearing livestock in the deserts of southern Israel. The community is traditional and conservative, with a well-defined value system that directs and monitors behaviour and interpersonal relations. The Negev Bedouin tribes have been divided into three classes, according to their origin: descendants of ancient Arabian nomads, descendants of some Sinai Bedouin tribes, and Palestinian peasants (Fellaheen) who came from cultivated areas. Al-Tarabin tribe is the largest tribe in the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula, Al-Tarabin along with Al-Tayaha, and Al-Azazma are the largest tribes in the Negev. Counter to the image of the Bedouin as fierce stateless nomads roving the entire region, by the turn of the 20th century, much of the Bedouin population in Palestine was settled, semi-nomadic, and engaged in agriculture according to an intricate system of land ownership, grazing rights, and water access. Today, many Bedouin call themselves 'Negev Arabs' rather than 'Bedouin', explaining that 'Bedouin' identity is intimately tied in with a pastoral nomadic way of life ‚Äì a way of life they say is over. Although the Bedouin in Israel continue to be perceived as nomads, today all of them are fully sedentarized, and about half are urbanites. Nevertheless, Negev Bedouin continue to possess sheep and goats: In 2000 the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that the Negev Bedouin owned 200,000 head of sheep and 5,000 of goats, while Bedouin estimates referred to 230,000 sheep and 20,000 goats.Aref Abu Rabia. \\"Employment and Unemployment among the Negev Bedouin\\"; Nomadic Peoples, Vol. 4, 2000 History =Antiquity= Traditional Bedouin camel race in the northern Negev near Arad, Israel Historically, the Bedouin engaged in nomadic herding, agriculture and sometimes fishing. They also earned income by transporting goods and peopleHIDDEN HISTORY, SECRET PRESENT: THE ORIGINS AND STATUS OF AFRICAN PALESTINIANS, Susan Beckerleg, translated by Salah Al Zaroo On Africans in the Negev Desert across the desert. Scarcity of water and of permanent pastoral land required them to move constantly. The first recorded nomadic settlement in Sinai dates back 4,000-7,000 years. The Bedouin of the Sinai peninsula migrated to and from the Negev. The Bedouin established very few permanent settlements; however, some evidence remains of traditional baika buildings, seasonal dwellings for the rainy season when they would stop to engage in farming. Cemeteries known as \\"nawamis\\" dating to the late fourth millennium B.C. have been also found. Similarly, open-air mosques (without a roof) dating from the early Islamic period are common and still in use. The Bedouin conducted extensive farming on plots scattered throughout the Negev. During the 6th century, Emperor Justinian sent Wallachian and Bosnian slaves to the Sinai to build Saint Catherine's Monastery. Over time these slaves converted to Islam, and adopted an Arab Bedouin lifestyle. =Islamic era= In the 7th century, the Islamic Umayyad dynasty defeated the Byzantine armies, conquering Palestine. The Umayyads began sponsoring building programs throughout Palestine, a region in close proximity to the dynastic capital in Damascus, and the Bedouin flourished. However, this activity decreased after the capital was moved to Baghdad during the subsequent Abbasid reign. =Ottoman era= Tal Al-Sba' inhabited since 1100 BCE African slave belonging to Tiyaha bedouin, 1847 Most of the Negev Bedouin tribes migrated to the Negev from the Arabian Desert, Transjordan, Egypt, and the Sinai from the 18th century onwards.Contested Indigeneity: The Development of an Indigenous Discourse on the Bedouin of the NegevHavatzelet Yahel, Ruth Kark, Seth J. Frantzman, Are the Negev Bedouin an Indigenous People? Fabricating Palestinian history. The Negev Bedouin, Middle East Quarterly, Summer 2012, pp. 3-14 Traditional Bedouin lifestyle began to change after the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. The rise of the puritanical Wahhabi sect forced them to reduce their raiding of caravans. Instead, the Bedouin acquired a monopoly on guiding pilgrim caravans to Mecca, as well as selling them provisions. The opening of the Suez canal reduced the dependence on desert caravans and attracted the Bedouin to newly formed settlements that sprung up along the canal. Bedouin sedentarization begun under Ottoman ruleJodi Magness, The Archaeology of the Early Islamic Settlement in Palestine, Eisenbrauns, 2003, p.82 following the need in establishing law and order in the Negev - the Ottoman Empire viewed the Bedouins as a threat to the state's control. In 1858, a new Ottoman Land Law was issued that offered the legal grounds for the displacement of the Bedouin. Under the Tanzimat reforms instituted as the Ottoman Empire gradually lost power, the Ottoman Land Law of 1858 instituted an unprecedented land registration process which was also meant to boost the empire's tax base. Few Bedouin opted to register their lands with the Ottoman Tapu, due to lack of enforcement by the Ottomans, illiteracy, refusal to pay taxes and lack of relevance of written documentation of ownership to the Bedouin way of life at that time.Gershon Shafir, Land, Labor and the Origins of the Israeli- Palestinian Conflict 1882-1914. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press At the end of the 19th century Sultan Abdul Hamid II (Abd√ºlhamid II) undertook other measures in order to control the Bedouin. As a part of this policy he settled loyal Muslim populations from the Balkan and Caucasus (Circassians) among the areas predominantly populated by the nomads, and also created several permanent Bedouin settlements, although the majority of them did not remain.Dr. Seth J. Frantzman, Ruth Kark Bedouin Settlement in Late Ottoman and British Mandatory Palestine: Influence on the Cultural and Environmental Landscape, 1870-1948 In 1900 an urban administrative center of Beersheva was established in order to extend governmental control over the area. Another measure initiated by the Ottoman authorities was the private acquisition of large plots of state land offered by the sultan to the absentee landowners (effendis). Numerous tenants were brought in order to cultivate the newly acquired lands. And the main trend of settling non-Bedouin population in the Palestine remained until the last days of the empire. By the 20th century much of the Bedouin population was settled, semi-nomadic, and engaged in agriculture according to an intricate system of land ownership, grazing rights, and water access.Ghazi Falah. \\"The Spatial Pattern of Bedouin Sedentarization in Israel,\\" GeoJournal, Vol. 11, No. 4, pp. 361-68; 1985 (\\"Semi-nomadic\\" in this case refers to movement within a limited 12-13 km radius), cited in: Rebecca Manski.\\"THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE IN BEDOUIN URBAN TOWNSHIPS: THE END OF SELF-SUBSISTENCE\\" originally published in Hebrew by the Life & Environment NGO coalition in: \\"Environmental Injustice Report 2007\\" During World War I, the Negev Bedouin fought with the Turks against the British, but later withdrew from the conflict.

Page 244. =British mandate era= Bedouin male on camel The British Mandate in Palestine brought order to the Negev; however, this order was accompanied by losses in sources of income and poverty among the Bedouin. The Bedouin nevertheless retained their lifestyle, and a 1927 report describes them as the \\"untamed denizens of the Arabian deserts.\\" The British also established the first formal schools for the Bedouin. In Orientalist historiography, the Negev Bedouin have been described as remaining largely unaffected by changes in the outside world until recently. Their society was often considered a \\"world without time.\\" Recent scholars have challenged the notion of the Bedouin as 'fossilized,' or 'stagnant' reflections of an unchanging desert culture. Emanuel Marx has shown that Bedouin were engaged in a constantly dynamic reciprocal relation with urban centers. Bedouin scholar Michael Meeker explains that \\"the city was to be found in their midst.\\" The British Mandate authorities, laws and bureaucracy favored settled groups above pastoral nomads and they found it hard to fit in the Negev Bedouin into their system of governance, thus the Mandate's policy regarding the Bedouin tribes of Palestine was often of an ad hoc nature. But eventually, as had happened with the Ottoman authorities, the British turned to coercion. Several regulations were issued, such as the Bedouin Control Ordinance (1942), meant to provide the administration with \\"special powers of control of nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes with the object of persuading them towards a more settled way of life\\". The ample powers of the Ordinance empowered the District Commissioner to direct the Bedouin \\"to go to, or not go to, or to remain in any specified area\\". Mandatory land policies created legal and demographic pressures for sedentarization, and by the end of the British Mandate the majority of the Bedouin were settled. They built some 60 new villages and dispersed settlements, populated by 27,500 people in 1945, according to the Mandate authorities. The only exception were the Negev Bedouin who remained semi-nomadic, but it was clear that sooner or later they will be settled, too. =1948 war= Bedouin tent near Rahat, 1950s Rahat 2015 Prior to the founding of Israel, the Negev's population consisted almost entirely of 110,000 Bedouin.The Naqab (Negev) Under the Microscope: Roots, Reality, Destiny During the war, Negev Bedouin favoured marginally both sides of the conflict;Fr√©d√©ric Encel, G√©opolitique d'Isra√´l : \\"Lors de la premi√®re guerre isra√©lo-arabe de 1948-1949, les B√©douins n'interviennent que marginalement d'un c√¥t√© ou de l'autre.

In early 1949 the Israeli army moved thousands of Bedouin from south and west of Beersheba to a concentration zone east of the town.

Cambridge University Press. . Page 36. Of the approximately 110,000 Bedouin who lived in the area before the war about 11,000 remained. Most had relocated from the northwestern to the northeastern Negev. = Bedouin refugees in Jordan = Due to destabilizing tribal wars from 1780 to 1890 many Negev Bedouins tribes were forced to move to southern Jordan, Sinai peninsula. After the tribal war of 1890, tribal land boundaries remained fixed until the 1948 war, by which time the Beduin of the Negev numbered approximately 110,000, and were organized into 95 tribes and clans. When Beersheba was occupied by the Israeli army in 1948, 90% of the Bedouin population of the Negev voluntarily left with the expectation that they would return when Israel lost their war for independence ‚Äì mainly to Jordan and Sinai peninsula. Of the approximately 110,000 Bedouin who lived in the Negev before the war about 11,000 remained. =Israel= The first Israeli government headed by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion opposed the return of the Bedouin from Jordan and Egypt. At first he wanted to expel the few remaining Bedouin but changed his mind. The lands were nationalized and the area was declared a military zone. The government saw the Negev as a potential home for the masses of Jewish immigrants, including 700,000 Jewish refugees from Arab lands. In the following years, some 50 Jewish settlements were established in the Negev.Shlomo Swirski and Yael Hasson. \\"INVISIBLE CITIZENS: Israel Government Policy Toward the Negev Bedouin\\"; Adva Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev: Center for Bedouin Studies & Development Research Unit and, Negev Center for Regional Development, 2006. PDF The Bedouin who remained in the Negev belonged to the Al-Tiyaha confederation as well as some smaller groups such as the 'Azazme and the Jahalin. They were relocated by the Israeli government in the 1950s and 1960s to a restricted zone in the northeast corner of the Negev, called the Siyagh ( , an Arabic word that can be translated as the \\"permitted area\\") made up of in 10% of the Negev desert in the northeast.Hamdan, H. \\"The Policy of Settlement and Spatial Judaization in the Naqab\\" Adalah News (11 -2005) In 1951, the United Nations reported the deportation of about 7,000 Negev Bedouin to Jordan, the Gaza Strip and Sinai, but many returned undetected.Cook, Jonathan. BEDOUIN \\"TRANSFER\\". MERIP. May 10, 2003. Retrieved July 4th, 07. The new government failed to issue the Bedouin identity cards until 1952 and deported thousands of Bedouin who remained within the new borders.Masalha, Nur, A Land Without People: Israel, Transfer and the Palestinians, 1949-1996 (London: Faber and Faber, 1997) Deportation continued into the late 1950s, as reported by Haaretz newspaper in 1959: \\"The army's desert patrols would turn up in the midst of a Bedouin encampment day after day, dispersing it with a sudden burst of machine-gun fire until the sons of the desert were broken and, gathering what little was left of their belongings, led their camels in long silent strings into the heart of the Sinai desert.\\" Land ownership issues Israel's land policy was adapted to a large extent from the Ottoman land regulations of 1858. According to the 1858 Ottoman Land Law, lands that were not registered as of private ownership, were considered state lands. However, Bedouins were not motivated to register lands they lived on, because land ownership meant additional responsibilities for them, including taxation and military duty, and it created a new problem since they found it hard to prove their ownership rights. Israel relied mainly on Tabu recordings. Most of the Bedouin land fell under the Ottoman class of 'non-workable' (mawat) land and thus belonged to the state under Ottoman law. Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands, using The Land Rights Settlement Ordinance passed in 1969.(Hebrew) Dr. Tobi Fenster, A summary stance paper on Bedouin land issues, written for \\"Sikkuy - for equal opportunity\\" Israel's policies regarding the Negev Bedouin at first included regulation and re-location. During the 1950s Israel has re-located two-thirds of the Negev Bedouins into an area that was under a martial law. Bedouin tribes were concentrated in the Siyagh (Arabic for \\"the permitted area\\") triangle of Beer Sheva, Arad and Dimona. At the same time Bedouin herding was restricted by land expropriation. The Black Goat Law of 1950 curbed grazing so as to prevent land erosion, prohibiting the grazing of goats outside recognized land holdings. Because few Bedouin territorial claims were recognized, most grazing was rendered illegal. Since both Ottoman and British land registration processes had failed to reach into the Negev region before Israeli rule, and since most Bedouin preferred not to register their lands, few Bedouin possessed any documentation of their land claims. Those whose land claims were recognized found it almost impossible to keep their goats within the periphery of their newly limited range. Into the 1970s and 1980s, only a small portion of the Bedouin were able to continue to graze their goats, and instead of migrating with their goats in search of pasture, most Bedouin migrated in search of work. Rahat, the largest Bedouin city in the Negev Despite state hegemony over the Negev, the Bedouin regarded 600,000 dunams (600 km2 or about 150,000 acres) of the Negev as theirs, and later petitioned the government for their return.\\"The Beduin of the Negev\\", Israel Land Administration, updated as of March 11, 2007 Various claims committees were established to make legal arrangements to solve land disputes at least partially, but no proposals acceptable to both sides were approved. In the 1950s, as a consequence of losing access to their lands, many Bedouin men sought work on Jewish farms in the Negev. However, preference was given to Jewish labor, and as of 1958, employment in the Bedouin male population was less than 3.5%. IDF Chief Moshe Dayan was in favor of transfer the Bedouin to the center of the country in order to eliminate land claims and create a cadre of urban laborers. In 1963, he told Haaretz:End of the road for the Bedouin > \\"We should transform the Bedouin into an urban proletariat - in industry, > services, construction, and agriculture. 88% of the Israeli population are > not farmers, let the Bedouin be like them. Indeed, this will be a radical > move which means that the Bedouin would not live on his land with his herds, > but would become an urban person who comes home in the afternoon and puts > his slippers on. His children will get used to a father who wears pants, > without a dagger, and who does not pick out their nits in public. They will > go to school, their hair combed and parted. This will be a revolution, but > it can be achieved in two generations. Without coercion but with > governmental direction ... this phenomenon of the Bedouins will disappear.\\" Ben-Gurion supported this idea, but the Bedouin strongly opposed. Later, the proposal was withdrawn. IDF commander Yigal Allon proposed to concentrate the Bedouin in some large townships within the Siyag. This proposal resembled an earlier IDF plan, which intended to secure land suitable for settling Jews and setting up IDF bases as well as to remove the Bedouin from key Negev routes. Israeli-built townships  Between 1968 and 1989 the state established urban townships for housing of deported Bedouin tribes and promised Bedouin services in exchange for the renunciation of their ancestral land. Hura school and community center Within a few years, half of the Bedouin population moved into the seven townships built for them by the Israeli government.

The plan was described as part of a campaign to develop the Negev; bring about better integration of Bedouin in Israeli society, and significantly reduce the economic and social gaps between the Bedouin population in the Negev and Israeli society. The cabinet also approved a NIS 1.2 billion economic development program for Bedouin Negev whose main purpose is to promote employment among Bedouin women and youth. Funding was allocated to the development of industrial zones, establishment of employment centers and professional training. According to the Prawer Plan, Bedouin communities will be expanded, some unrecognized communities will be recognized and receive public services, and infrastructure will be renewed, all within the framework of the Beer Sheva District masterplan. Most residents will be absorbed into the Abu Basma Regional Council and the nature of future communities, whether agricultural, rural, suburban or urban will be decided in full cooperation with the local Bedouin. For those who are to be relocated, 2/3 will receive a new residence nearby. Tirabin al-Sana's mosque (its dome taken from mosque in the previous Tarabin tribe residence place next to Omer) The Prawer Plan seeks to address the numerous land claims filed by the Bedouin, offering what the Israeli government states is \\"significant\\" compensation in land and funds, with each claim dealt with in a \\"unified and transparent way\\". The proposed solution will be put into binding legislation - Israeli Knesset will work out and accept appropriate legislation in the fall of 2012. Accordingly, the state will reorganize and strengthen the enforcement mechanism. A team headed by minister Benny Begin and Maj.-Gen. (ret.)

One of the plan's architects stated that the Bedouin had neither been consulted nor agreed to the move. \\"I didn't tell anyone that the Bedouin agreed to my plan. I couldn't say that because I didn't present the plan to them,\\" said the former minister Benny Begin.

The Bureau for the Settlement and Economic Development of the Bedouin Sector in the Negev, which was at the time in the Prime Minister's Office, was given responsibility for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the development program. Following government Resolution 1146 of January 5, 2014, responsibility for socioeconomic development and the status of Bedouin settlement in the Negev was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and a program to integrate the Bedouin population in the Negev was initiated by the Planning Authority, which is the funding agency for monitoring and supervising implementation of the development program. Resolution 3708 presented a five-year plan for 2012-2016 with goals of promoting the economic status of the Bedouin population in the Negev, strengthening Bedouin local authorities, and strengthening the social life, communities and leadership in the Bedouin population. In order to achieve these goals, it was decided to focus investment on women and young adults, particularly in the areas of employment and education. The resolution addressed the following five areas: 1\\\\. Raising the employment rate of the Bedouin population in the Negev, diversifying the places of employment, and increasing the integration of the Bedouin in employment in the Israeli economy 2\\\\. Developing infrastructures, particularly those that support employment, education, and society 3\\\\. Strengthening personal security 4\\\\. Promoting education among the Bedouin in the Negev in order to increase their participation in the labor market 5\\\\. Strengthening and developing social life within the community and leadership in the villages, and expanding social services. Several ministries were involved in implementation of the resolution: Economy, Education, Social Affairs and Services (MOSAS), MARD, Interior, Public Security, Defense (Security-Social Division), Transport and Road Safety, Culture and Sport, Development of the Negev and the Galilee, and Health. The total budget for implementation of the resolution was NIS 1.2633 billion, of which 68% was a supplementary sum (not taken from the budgets of the ministries). Clause 11 of Resolution 3708 stipulated that the program should be examined by an evaluation study. MARD commissioned the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute to examine the implementation of the resolution and its outcomes over a 3-year period. The study focused on four core areas that were important to the development and advancement of the Bedouin population and that represented 77% of the total budget allocated for the resolution (employment, social infrastructures, personal security, and education, Following two interim reports,Dr. Yonatan Eyal, Dr. Hagit Sofer Furman, Suzan Hassan-Daher, and Moria Frankel. 2016.

Among the findings were the following: * Establishing Riyan Employment Centers. The Riyan Centers provide participants with vocational guidance, professional training and job placement, and are situated in the communities themselves to take advantage of local resources. Prior to Resolution 3708, the centers operated in two only localities. With the implementation, they were distributed throughout all Bedouin local authorities and reached almost 10,000 people. About 50% of the men and 30% of the women were placed in jobs within a year of joining.Eyal, Tirosh, King, and Frankel, 12. * Practical Engineering Studies for Adults. Prior to the Resolution, Bedouin students in the Shiluv Program studied in separate college classes. Following the Resolution, the study model was changed, with students integrated into regular college classes and also receiving financial and personal support. As of 2017, 305 students had entered the engineering track, a quarter of whom were women.Eyal, Tirosh, King, and Frankel, 13. * Improved Access to Transportation. Since the Resolution, the number of inter-city trips increased by 94%, and of intra-city trips, by 43%. * Centers of Excellence. The Centers of Excellence are offer a weekly after- school program for students in grades 3-6, with a compulsory course in science and technology and an elective in a choice of subjects. Six centers became operative under the Resolution and, in 2017, served some 900 students.Eyal, Tirosh, King, and Frankel, 15. Healthcare The Bedouin benefited from the introduction of modern health care in the region. According to the World Zionist Organization, although in the 1980s, as compared with 90% of the Jewish population, only 50% of the Bedouin population was covered by Israel's General Sick Fund, the situation improved after the 1995 National Health Insurance Law incorporated another 30% of Negev Bedouin into the Sick Fund.Suzanna Kokkonen. \\"The Bedouins of the Negev confront a modern society\\"; World Zionist Organization Hagshama Department, October 31, 2002 There are branches of several health funds (medical clinics) operating in the seven Bedouin townships: Leumit, Clalit, Maccabi and perinatal (baby care) centers Tipat Halav. One of medical clinics in Rahat The Bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in Israel, and one of the highest in the developed world. In 2010, the mortality rate of Bedouin babies rose to 13.6 per 1,000, compared to 4.1 per 1,000 in Jewish communities in the south. According to the Israeli Ministry of Health, 43 percent of deaths among infants up to a year old result from hereditary conditions and/or birth defects. Other reasons cited for the higher infant mortality rates are poverty, lack of education and proper nourishment of mothers, lack of access to preventive medical care and unwillingness to undergo recommended tests. In 2011, funding for this purpose was tripled. A medical clinic in Hura 60% of Bedouin men smoke. Among the Bedouin, as of 2003, 7.3% of females and 9.9% of males have diabetes.\\"The Negev is the southern region of Israel and is an ideal location for implementing community intervention programmes for populations in transition\\" ; Oxford Health Alliance, 2008 Between 1998 and 2002, Bedouin towns and villages had among the highest per-capita hospitalization rates, Rahat and Tel Sheva ranked highest. However, the rate of reported new cancer incidents in Bedouin localities is very low, with Rahat having the 3rd-lowest rate in Israel at 141.9 cases per 100,000, compared to 422.1 cases in Haifa. The Centre for Women's Health Studies and Promotion notes that in the unrecognised Bedouin villages in the Negev, very few health care facilities are available; ambulances do not serve the villages and 38 villages have no medical services.\\"Briefing to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women\\"; Amnesty International, 2005 (citing J. Cwikel and N. Barak, Health and Welfare of Bedouin Women in the Negev, The Centre for Women‚Äôs Health Studies and Promotion, Ben Gurion University, 2001) According to the Israeli NGO Physicians for Human Rights-Israel the number of doctors is a third of the norm.\\"Without Water! Position Paper on the Right to Water in Unrecognized Villages\\"; PHR-Israel September 2004 In urban townships, access to water is also an issue: an article from the World Zionist Organization Hagshama Department explains that water allocation to Bedouin towns is 25-50% of that to Jewish towns. Since the State has not built water infrastructure in the unrecognized villages, residents must buy water and store it in large tanks where fungi, bacteria and rust develop very quickly in the plastic containers or metal tanks under conditions of extreme heat; this has led to numerous infections and skin diseases. Education In the 1950s, mandatory schooling was extended to the Bedouin sector, leading to a massive increase in literacy levels. Illiteracy decreased from around 95% to 25% within the span of a single generation, with the majority of the illiterate being 55 or older.The Bedouin in Israel Drop-out rates were once very high among Negev Bedouin. In 1998 only 43 percent of Bedouin youngsters reached the 12th grade. Enforcement of mandatory education for the Bedouin was weak, particularly in the case of young girls. According to a 2001 study by the Centre for Women's Health Studies and Promotion more than 75% of Bedouin women had never been to or completed elementary school. This was due to a combination of internal Bedouin traditional attitudes towards women, lack of government enforcement of the Mandatory Education Law and insufficient budgets for Bedouin schools.

Arabic summer schools are being developed.A Bedouin growth industry Haaretz, 2 July 2007 In 2006, 162 Bedouin men and 112 Bedouin women were studying at Ben Gurion University.

According to data released by the Knesset Research and Information Center in July 2012, at least 800 young Bedouins from the Negev (out of overall 1300 Israeli students studying in PA) opted for universities in the Palestinian Authority, mainly Hebron and Jenin, preferring Muslim studies (Sharia) and education.Yanir Yagna, Israel's Bedouin are opting for West Bank universities, Haaretz, July 29, 2012 It's a relatively new phenomenon, occurring in the past year or two and its main reasons are relatively difficult psychometric exams hampering to be accepted into Israeli universities and colleges (in PA there is no such a requirement), absence of Muslim studies subject in them and a language barrier.Tomer Velmer, [Leap in number of Israelis studying in PA http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4181944,00.html], Ynetnews, January 28, 2012 One of eight (July 2012) Rahat schools In fall 2011 Ben-Gurion University of the Negev has revived a special program preparing Bedouins to fill a dire need in school psychologists in their communities' schools due to a host of issues particular to this population, from aged-old inter-clan rivalries to the emotional fallout from polygamy. This program is leading to a master's degree in educational psychology for Arab-Israeli and Bedouin students. Program's leaders admit that only a professional from within the society can fully understand the intricacies of its unique situations.Abigail Klein Leichman, Wanted: Bedouin school psychologists, Israel 21c, July 30, 2012 Additionally, a new Harvard University campus will be established in Rahat inside Idan haNegev industrial zone in the coming years. It will be the first campus built in this Bedouin city. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev will oversee the new campus' operations, and it will be considered a BGU branch. A few years ago the Association of Academics for the Development of Arab Society in the Negev (AHD) has established a new science high school at the Shoket Junction. This school hosts some 380 students in grades nine through twelve from Bedouin Arab towns and villages. First students graduated it in the spring of 2012.Israeli Science High School Advances Bedouin Community, August 15, 2011 Women's status According to a range of studies, including a 2001 study by the Centre for Women's Health Studies and Promotion at Ben Gurion University, in the transition from self-subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry to a settled semi-urban lifestyle, women have lost their traditional sources of power within the family. The study explains that poor access to education among women has triggered new disparities between Bedouin men and women and compounded the loss of Bedouin women's status in the family.J. Cwikel and N. Barak, Health and Welfare of Bedouin Women in the Negev, The Centre for Women‚Äôs Health Studies and Promotion, Ben Gurion University, 2001 Nevertheless, due to high levels of poverty among the Bedouin more and more Bedouin women are starting to work outside their homes and reinforce their status. However, some of these women encounter fierce resistance from family members, and in some cases have experienced physical violence and even murder. There were reports that some Bedouin tribes had previously conducted female genital mutilation. However, this practice was considered far less severe than what is carried out in some places in Africa, consisting of a \\"small\\" cut. The practice was carried out independently by women, and men didn't play a part and in most cases were unaware of the practice. However, by 2009 the practice seemed to have disappeared. Researchers are unclear as to how it disappeared (the Israeli government was not involved) but suggest modernisation as the probable cause. Economy Private home in al-Sayyid The Negev Bedouin suffer from extreme rates of joblessness and the highest poverty rate in Israel. A 2007 Van Leer Institute study found that 66 percent of Negev Bedouin lived below the poverty line (in unrecognized villages, the figure reached 80 percent), compared 25 percent in the Israeli population.Ruth Sinai. \\"66% of Negev Bedouin live below poverty line\\"; Haaretz, January 15, 2007 Data collected by the Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry in 2010 show that the employment rate among the Bedouin is 35 percent, the lowest of any sector in Israeli society.Ron Friedman, Ministers inaugurate new projects in South to help Beduins, Jerusalem Post, April 28, 2010 Traditionally, Bedouin men are the breadwinners, while Bedouin women do not work outside the home.

Arab-Bedouin Fashion Design As a result, tourism and crafts are growing industries and in some cases, such as Drijat, have reduced unemployment significantly. The new industrial zones being constructed in the region are also increasing job opportunities. Crime The crime rate in the Bedouin sector in the Negev is among the highest in the country.Phoebe Greenwood, Bedouin land and culture threatened by Israel's plans for resettlement, The Guardian, May 9, 2012 To that end, a special police unit, codenamed Blimat Herum (lit. emergency halt), consisting of about 100 regular policemen, was founded in 2003 to fight crime in the sector. The Southern District of the Israel Police cited the rising crime rate in the sector as the reason for the unit's inauguration. The unit was founded after a period of time when regular police units conducted raids on Bedouin settlements to stop theft (especially car theft) and drug dealing. In 2004 a new police station was opened in Rahat, it has around 70 staff policemen. Environmental issues Rahat park In 1979, a 1,500 square kilometer area in the Negev was declared a protected nature reserve, rendering it out of bounds for Bedouin herders.

Invasive Species Factsheets, Michigan State University. The female has a globe-shaped body with a thick, lacy cuticle. It retains its eggs inside its body rather than releasing them, and becomes a brown cyst when it dies.Globodera pallida. Nemaplex. UC Davis. Revised 2013. The female is white to cream in color. Globodera rostochiensis is similar in appearance, but the female is yellow in color for part of its life. The male has a wormlike body which is held in a C- or S-shape. This nematode is thought to be native to the Andes. Today it is found in 55 countries, mostly in temperate regions. The microscopic cysts are tough and can survive in soil particles, which are transported around the world on objects such as farming equipment and in flowing water. It has been primarily distributed on potatoes, which were introduced from South America to the rest of the world. It can also live on other solanaceous crops such as tomato and eggplant, and many solanaceous weed species, such as black nightshade (Solanum nigrum). The juvenile nematodes feed on the roots of the plant. Eggs develop inside the females after fertilization, and when the females die they become tough cysts that protect the mature eggs. The eggs in the cysts can remain viable for up to 30 years. The cysts detach from the roots and drop into the soil, where they can be distributed via soil movement. An infested plant becomes yellow and wilted and loses its leaves. This nematode is an important agricultural pest, especially in Europe. It causes economic losses of about ¬£50 million per year in the United Kingdom alone. Laws defining best management practices have been passed to reduce the spread of the pest. The movement of soil and potatoes across national boundaries is monitored with quarantines. Farming equipment is cleaned, soil is tested for nematodes, contaminated soil is kept out of fields, and resistant cultivars of crops are alternated with susceptible varieties to reduce the possibility that a more virulent nematode will arise through selection. The nematode is found nearly worldwide today, but it has been mostly kept out of the United States due to rigid quarantines. An exception is one outbreak that occurred in Idaho in 2006. Upon discovery of this outbreak, Japan banned potato imports from the United States for several years. The genome of this nematode has been sequenced.

It is a pest of plants in the family Solanaceae, primarily infesting potatoes and tomatoes, as well as a variety of other root crops.  Pathology  The golden nematode negatively affects plants of the family Solanaceae by forming cysts on the roots of susceptible species. The cysts, which are composed of dead nematodes, are formed to protect the female's eggs and are typically yellow-brown in color. The first symptoms of infestation are typically poor plant growth, chlorosis, and wilting. Heavy infestations can lead to reduced root systems, water stress, and nutrient deficiencies, while indirect effects of an infestation include premature senescence and increased susceptibility to fungal infections. Symptoms of golden nematode infestation are not unique, and thus identification of the pest is usually performed through testing of soil samples. An infestation may take several years to develop, and can often go unnoticed for between five and seven years. After detection, however, it may take up to thirty years for the pest to be effectively eradicated. Distribution The golden nematode, along with the pale cyst nematode, originated in the Andes Mountains of South America. It was first discovered near the city of Rostock, Germany in 1913, although it is thought to have arrived in Europe with imported potatoes sometime during 19th century. It was first discovered in the United States in 1941, in Canada during the 1960s, in India during 1961 and in Mexico during the 1970s. It has also been found in various locations throughout Asia, Africa, and Australia. The golden nematode blight on the Saanich Peninsula In the 1960s, the golden nematode was discovered in fields in Saanich, BC, Canada. The response of local and national officials provides an interesting insight into the impact a nematode infestation can have on a community. The golden nematode survives best in climates with relatively moist summers and mild winters. Accordingly, while much of Canada‚Äôs climate remains too harsh for the pest to flourish, the mild climate of southern Vancouver Island is particularly well suited to a golden nematode infestation. In 1965, Central Saanich became the second area in Canada to be quarantined after the discovery of the golden nematode on a local farm. The presence of the golden nematode resulted in what biologist John Webster deemed a ‚Äúbombshell.‚Äù Almost immediately, the seed potato industry and much of the rest of the agricultural export industry throughout British Columbia was shut down. Specialists from Agriculture Canada surveyed all fields in BC in which potatoes were grown in an attempt to detect and isolate the problem. By 1966, it had been determined that the golden nematode was confined to an approximately area of land on the Peninsula. It has been suggested that the pest was transmitted to this relatively sheltered area via plant material imported from Europe, possibly in the 1950s. Agriculture Canada quickly took steps to contain and eradicate the nematode. First, a quarantine zone of approximately was established. Farmers were provided with a small financial compensation to help them manage during the proposed eradication process. Following the quarantine, infested lands were fumigated with a pesticide called dichloropropenedichloropropane at least twice. By 1980, however, it was clear that attempts to eradicate the nematode had been unsuccessful. As a result, in 1982, the Department of Agriculture enacted the Golden Nematode Order which banned the growing of all nursery stock, root crops, and other plants which might spread the nematode and restricted the movement of any soil and material from the quarantine area. =Controversy= Financial compensation was arranged for affected farmers. Nevertheless, for many Saanich farmers the quarantine caused considerable and long-lasting financial damage, particularly for those who had invested heavily in formerly lucrative potato industry. In 1991, farmers announced that alternative crops had not been viable replacements for their former crops. Exacerbated by a poor growing season in which some Peninsula farmers lost approximately 40% of their crops, several farms were going into debt while selling their new vegetable crops at a loss. Several farmers called for a revision or repeal of the quarantine, suggesting that the nematode had been effectively eradicated. Lobby groups throughout BC, however, appealed to the provincial and federal governments to retain the ban, arguing that even the remote possibility of spreading the golden nematode by opening up the Saanich Peninsula to international trade would negatively impact the BC vegetable industry A decision was made to retain the ban, and appeals to the government by Saanich farmers for redress were refused on the grounds of previous financial restitution. =Impact= The golden nematode infestation and the resultant ban on root crop growth, especially potatoes, had both direct and indirect consequences for the Saanich Peninsula community. Foremost, several large- scale farms were forced to sell portions of their land, encouraging a trend away from industrial farming and toward smaller-scale farming on the Peninsula. Additionally, the Peninsula farmers were forced to look to alternate crops and agri-tourism solutions to remain afloat; the Golden Nematode Order banned the growth of potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, which together account for approximately 50% of all fresh vegetables consumed by Canadians. Without access to this substantial portion of the market, Peninsula farmers sought alternate crops, which included kiwis, berries, and grapes. Thus, combined with outside competition and new industries taking priority, the farming industry has substantially diminished on the Saanich Peninsula. It has been suggested that while fifty years ago, over 90% of food on the Peninsula was grown locally, by 2004 this percentage had dropped below 10%.

The club was founded in 1945 as Sportverein Nordhorn and adopted the name Eintracht Nordhorn in 1947. A separate football club known as SV Concordia Nordhorn briefly split away in 1953, but rejoined the parent association four years later. The football side was part of a larger sports club that had departments for basketball, table tennis, tennis, and volleyball. __TOC__ History The team climbed up out of local league play into the Amateurliga Niedersachsen (II) in the early 50s and by the middle of the decade was playing the first division Oberliga Nord. They earned only lower table results and were relegated in 1960. Eintracht returned briefly to the top flight two seasons later, but following the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's first professional league, in 1963, settled firmly into what had become third division play in the Amateurliga. The club's best results came in the 70s; they captured the Niedersachsenpokal (Lower Saxony Cup) in 1974, earned a second-place result in the Amateurliga in 1975, and made appearances in DFB Pokal (German Cup) play in 1975, 1978, 1979, and 1981. This was followed by a slide that ended in relegation to the Verbandsliga Niedersachsen (IV) in 1981. The club made a re-appearance in third tier competition in the Oberliga Nord in 1990 but fell to the Verbandsliga Niedersachsen West (V) by 1994. Since then Eintracht has largely played fourth division football in the Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen or Oberliga Nord, with the exception of a three-season turn in the Regionalliga Nord (III) in the late 90s. In 2012 Einracht slid to Landesliga Weser-Ems (VI) and in 2014 slid again to Bezirksliga Weser-Ems (VII).Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon.

Biography Daniel Fraser was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and emigrated to New York and then Canada as a child. He was educated in Huron County, Ontario. He apprenticed as a millwright, joiner, and carpenter before moving to Manitoba in 1874 to work for the Hudson's Bay Company and later McCauley & Jarvis. In 1880 he returned to the Hudson's Bay Company, for whom he built a saw and flour mill in Edmonton and a flour mill in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. He finally settled in Edmonton in 1881 and operated his own mill under the name D R Fraser & Company Limited before becoming President of Alberta Milling Co., which operated four flour mills, and later Edmonton Pressed Brick Co. He married Jane McCann in 1891; the couple had four children. In 1892, Fraser was elected as an alderman to Edmonton's inaugural Town Council, finishing second of fourteen candidates (the top six were elected). However, he was defeated in his 1893 re-election bid, finishing last of nine candidates. He stayed out of politics until 1896, when he squeaked back into office by finishing sixth of nine candidates (three votes ahead of future mayor William Thomas Henry). He did not seek re-election in 1898, and removed himself from politics once again until 1902, when he returned to office. finishing first in the aldermanic race. Fraser sought re-election in 1904 (aldermanic terms had been increased to two years), the year of Edmonton's incorporation as a city rather than a town. The number of aldermen was increased from six to eight. In order to maintain the system of staggered two year aldermanic terms, it was decided that the four candidates receiving the most votes in the 1904 election would be elected to two year terms, while the four receiving the next highest number of votes would be elected to one year terms. Fraser finished seventh of seventeen candidates, and was therefore elected to a one-year term. He was defeated in his 1905 bid for re-election, finishing eighth of ten candidates. At this point, Fraser took a third hiatus from politics, which lasted until 1908 when he ran again and finished sixth of thirteen candidates. Since the electoral system at the time had four aldermen elected to two year terms each year, Fraser's sixth place showing would normally have been insufficient to be elected; however, two of the aldermen elected in 1907 (Robert Lee and Thomas Bellamy) had resigned, allowing Fraser and fifth-place finisher Andrew Agar to be elected for one year to serve out their terms. Fraser did not seek re- election in 1909 and stayed out of politics thereafter. He died in 1920.

The name of the order is derived from the Greek words paleo (ancient) and ·ΩÄŒΩŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ (oniskos or woodlouse), probably pertaining to the organization of the fishes' scales, similar to the exoskeletal plating of woodlice. Classification Acropholis stensioei fossil at the Geological Museum in Copenhagen It is not a natural group, but is instead a paraphyletic assemblage of the early members of several ray-finned fish lineages. It has traditionally encompassed most Paleozoic actinopterygians, except those that exhibit strange body forms (such as the deep-bodied Platysomoidea, or those assigned definitively to any of the living groups of ray-finned fishes. Andreolepis hedei has proven so far to be the earliest-known actinopterygiian, living around 420 million years ago (Late Silurian in Russia, Sweden, Estonia, and Latvia. Actinopterygians underwent an extensive diversification during the Carboniferous, after the end-Devonian Hangenberg extinction.

","title":"Palaeonisciformes"},{"id":"11890258","text":"The Century Building, designed by Raeder, Coffin, and Crocker and completed in 1896, was a 10-story Classical Revival historic building in downtown St. Louis, Missouri that was used for offices, retail, and a 1600-seat theatre. http://web.nationalbuildingarts.org/recovery-projects/theater-office/century/ It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 2002. In 1999, St. Louis planners and historic preservationists working as an advisory committee released their Downtown Plan, which called for the preservation and adaptive reuse of the Century Building.Joseph Heathcott, \\"Historic Preservation: Paving Paradise\\" The Next American City The Slay administration rejected the recommendations of the committee, and announced that a development team had been chosen (DESCO and DFC, Inc) to renovate the nearby historic Old Post Office (OPO) and to demolish the Century Building in order to build a parking deck to service the OPO. City officials made the argument that tenants for the renovated OPO building demanded parking within view of their new offices. St. Louis' preservationists' next line of defense was the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP). Contacted in 2001, NTHP was initially supportive of preservation efforts for the building. Midwest Trust Director Royce Yeater recommended that an alternative site be chosen for the proposed parking deck, noting that there were \\"10 underused parking facilities in the 10 blocks surrounding the OPO.\\" In 2004, the NTHP changed its stance concerning the project. The NTHP would now provide $6.9 million in gap financing in the form of tax credits for the OPO renovations and parking deck. NTHP refused to stop the demolition of the Century Building, and was now supporting the very project that preservationists were desperately trying to stop. Preservationists around the country signed an on-line petition in a concerted effort to save the Century Building. Richard Moe, president of the NTHP, defended his organization's actions by stating that the demolition of the Century Building was key to revitalizing the area around the OPO.New York Times article - March 31, 2005 The Landmarks Association filed a final lawsuit on October 19, 2004 requesting a temporary restraining order to halt demolition.St. Louis Business Journal, October 21, 2004 Their request was ultimately denied, and demolition of the building commenced shortly thereafter. Many historic preservationists call the loss of the Century Building a major sacrifice for Downtown St. Louis. Some have also said the NTHP drifted from its primary mission of historic preservation by supporting the developers of the OPO project. Other professionals take the side that certain sacrifices need to be made in order to improve neighborhoods as whole, and the Century Building was one of these sacrifices. It is generally agreed, however, that the Century Building was an important part of St. Louis' architectural history, and could have been transformed into an asset for Downtown St. Louis had the building been saved. Beams and parts of its facade were recovered by the St. Louis Building Arts Foundation. They're currently stored at the foundation's Sauget foundry.

When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Bagnasco, p. 110 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the third batch boats had a range of at and at submerged. Sea Scout was armed with six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow. She carried six reload torpedoes for a grand total of a dozen torpedoes. Twelve mines could be carried in lieu of the torpedoes. The boat was also equipped with a 4-inch (102 mm) deck gun. Construction and career HMS Sea Scout was built by Cammell Laird and launched on 24 March 1944. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Sea Scout. She spent most of her wartime career in the Far East, where she sank numerous Japanese ships, including twelve sailing vessels, two coasters, two unidentified vessels, a sampan, a patrol vessel and a tug with five barges.HMS Sea Scout, Uboat.net She survived the Second World War, in 1953 taking part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden She was eventually sold and arrived at Swansea on 14 December 1965 for breaking up.

Gourley was born in St. Louis in 1926. He met saxophonist Lee Konitz in Chicago when both were members of the same high school band. He credits Konitz with encouraging him to become a serious musician. Gourley's father started the Monarch Conservatory of Music in Hammond, Indiana, though he didn't teach, and he bought Gourley his first guitar. Gourley took his first guitar classes at the school. He became interested in jazz while listening to the radio, enjoying in particular Nat King Cole. For his first professional experience as a performer, he dropped out of high school to play with a jazz band in Oklahoma City. From 1944‚Äì1946, Gourley served in the U.S. Navy. After he returned to Chicago, he met guitarist Jimmy Raney and wanted to play like him. He worked in bars and clubs with Jackie Cain & Roy Kral, Anita O'Day, Sonny Stitt, and Gene Ammons. Through the G.I. Bill, he received tuition for three years to any college in the world. Beginning in 1951, Gourley spent the rest of his life in France, working with Henri Renaud, Lou Bennett, Kenny Clarke, Richard Galliano, St√©phane Grappelli, Bobby Jaspar, Eddy Louiss, Martial Solal, and Barney Wilen. He played with American musicians who were passing through, including Bob Brookmeyer, Clifford Brown, Stan Getz, Gigi Gryce, Roy Haynes, Lee Konitz, Bud Powell, Zoot Sims, Lucky Thompson, and Lester Young..

His training involved apprenticeships in various shops in France during the 1970s and 1980s. One of his apprenticeships was with the renowned Baroque instrument maker Stephen Murphy. He is also a graduate of the Prier Violin Making School of America in Salt Lake City, Utah. After 19 years of living in Utah, he moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas. He quickly established himself as a maker by selling violins to such notable performers as Jaime Laredo and Pinchas Zukerman who have, over time, acquired multiple Borman instruments. A short list of some well-known musicians who play instruments by Borman: * Anne Akiko Meyers * Kyung-wha Chung * Pamela Frank * Nicolas Kendall -Time for Three * Jaime Laredo * Cho-Liang Lin * Sharon Robinson * Joseph Silverstein * Pinchas Zukerman Borman was among only a handful of makers invited to show their instruments at both the 2006 and 2010 International Violin Competition of Indianapolis. These hands-on exhibitions highlighted the world's leading violin makers from Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. The exhibits provide rare opportunities to try violins by master makers of our time in one location. He is very involved in scientific research to further the capabilities of the violin, specifically towards the needs of the violin in the 21st century. His research work is focused on the material properties of the wood used to create violins using densitometry and computer aided tomography (computed tomography).

Initially available only in and around the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area, the company expanded distribution to include all of Minnesota and several nearby states. During the early 2010s, Surly experienced rapid growth, with production of 21,000 barrels in 2012, 28,000 barrels in 2013, and 47,757 barrels in 2015. Surly's brewing system in Brooklyn Center is a 30 beer barrel (BBL) Sprinkman, one of four identical systems produced by Sprinkman of Wisconsin. The Minneapolis location has a 100 barrel system. Despite sharing a similar name and being headquartered in the U.S. state of Minnesota, the brewing company and Surly Bikes are separate enterprises. An agreement between the two companies allows the bicycle manufacturer to display the single word \\"Surly\\" on its products. History The Surly brewery event space in Minneapolis that closed indefinitely in 2020. Surly Brewing Co. founder Omar Ansari had been homebrewing since 1994. After apprenticing at New Holland Brewing Company in Michigan and enlisting Todd Haug of Minneapolis's Rock Bottom Brewery, Surly Brewing began brewing in Brooklyn Center. In February 2011, Surly announced that it intended to open a restaurant and beer garden, which was expected to cost US$20 million. The new facility would also increase its brewing capacity to approximately 100,000 barrels. This type of installation was not in line with Minnesota's liquor laws, however. With the help of the Surly Nation, fans of the brewery's beer, some members of the Minnesota Legislature were convinced to propose changes in order to allow it. Minnesota's three-tier liquor sales system would not allow breweries to distribute their beer for retail sale and sell on the brewery's premises, as a brewpub does. After just a few months, changes to Minnesota's liquor laws that would allow Surly to sell beer for consumption at the proposed BrewPub, were passed in an omnibus liquor bill introduced by Rep. Jenifer Loon (R - Eden Prairie) and Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL - Brooklyn Park). Known as the \\"Surly Bill\\", this bill was signed into law by Governor Mark Dayton on 25 May 2011. In 2012, Esquire magazine selected Surly Brewing Company's CynicAle 16 ounce as one of the \\"Best Canned Beers to Drink Now\\" in a February article. Surly purchased an plot of land in Prospect Park, Minneapolis for its $20 million brewery in April 2013. Surly secured $2 million in environmental mediation grants from Hennepin County to address more than a century's worth of accumulated industrial pollution at the site. Their new brewery and taproom opened in December 2014. In 2020, Surly announced it would layoff 150 employees and indefinitely close its 350-seat beer hall, pizzeria, events center, and retail store in Minneapolis. Though the company said the decision was a result of declining revenue due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, announcement of it came just days after employees announced their intention to unionize under Unite Here Local 17 that represents restaurant and hospitality workers. Some labor leaders felt the move by Surly was retaliatory and filed unfair labor practice charges. The company said sales at its on-site location were down 82% from the prior year, and it was no longer profitable. Distribution For the first several years Surly was only available in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area due to limited supply. An initial expansion to Chicago was reversed in June 2010 to ensure they could reliably serve the brewery's home market. In November 2013, Surly re-entered the Chicago market, being offered at over one hundred different bars, restaurants, and liquor stores in the Chicago metropolitan area. This expansion included canned and kegged Surly Cynic, Hell, Bender, Overrated, and Coffee Bender, with some Chicago liquor stores carrying select Surly specialities when available. Surly Brewing to return to Chicago, Chicago Tribune, 7 November 2013, Josh Noel In early 2015 Surly expanded its distribution to include Iowa and also aimed to include Wisconsin by the end of the same year.

Journal of Environmmental Modelling & Software 94 (2017) 186-211. . Rationale There is a need for a computer program that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler data structure then most currently available models. Therefore, the SahysMod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized geo- hydrologists. It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be checked by hand using the formulas in this manual. SahysMod's objective is to predict the long-term hydro-salinity in terms of general trends, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now. Further, SahysMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and well water (e.g. for irrigation) and it can account for farmers' responses to waterlogging, soil salinity, water scarcity and over-pumping from the aquifer. Also it offers the possibility to introduce subsurface drainage systems at varying depths and with varying capacities so that they can be optimized. Other features of SahysMod are found in the next section.  Methods  = Calculation of aquifer conditions in polygons = Example of an aquifer The model calculates the ground water levels and the incoming and outgoing ground water flows between the polygons by a numerical solution of the well-known Boussinesq equation. The levels and flows influence each other mutually. The ground water situation is further determined by the vertical groundwater recharge that is calculated from the agronomic water balance. These depend again on the levels of the ground water. When semi-confined aquifers are present, the resistance to vertical flow in the slowly permeable top-layer and the overpressure in the aquifer, if any, are taken into account. Hydraulic boundary conditions are given as hydraulic heads in the external nodes in combination with the hydraulic conductivity between internal and external nodes. If one wishes to impose a zero flow condition at the external nodes, the conductivity can be set at zero. Further, aquifer flow conditions can be given for the internal nodes. These are required when a geological fault is present at the bottom of the aquifer or when flow occurs between the main aquifer and a deeper aquifer separated by a semi-confining layer. The depth of the water table, the rainfall and salt concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other parameters can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule. = Seasonal approach = The model is based on seasonal input data and returns seasonal outputs. The number of seasons per year can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. One can distinguish for example dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or fallow seasons. Reasons of not using smaller input/output periods are: #short-term (e.g., daily) inputs would require much information, which, in large areas, may not be readily available; #short-term outputs would lead to immense output files, which would be difficult to manage and interpret; #this model is especially developed to predict long-term trends, and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long-term) than on a daily (short-term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data; #though the precision of the predictions for the future may be limited, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear. For example, it need not be a major constraint to the design of appropriate soil salinity control measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by SahysMod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years. = Computational time steps = Many water balance factors depend on the level of the water table, which again depends on some of the water-balance factors. Due to these mutual influences there can be non-linear changes throughout the season. Therefore, the computer program performs daily calculations. For this purpose, the seasonal water-balance factors given with the inpu] are reduced automatically to daily values. The calculated seasonal water-balance factors, as given in the output, are obtained by summations of the daily calculated values. Groundwater levels and soil salinity (the state variables) at the end of the season are found by accumulating the daily changes of water and salt storage. In some cases the program may detect that the time step must be taken less than 1 day for better accuracy. The necessary adjustments are made automatically. Data requirements = Polygonal network = A polygonal network The model permits a maximum of 240 internal and 120 external polygons with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 sides each. The subdivision of the area into polygons, based on nodal points with known coordinates, should be governed by the characteristics of the distribution of the cropping, irrigation, drainage and groundwater characteristics over the study area. The nodes must be numbered, which can be done at will. With an index one indicates whether the node is internal or external. Nodes can be added and removed at will or changed from internal to external or vice versa. Through another index one indicates whether the internal nodes have an unconfined or semi-confined aquifer. This can also be changed at will. Nodal network relations are to be given indicating the neighboring polygon numbers of each node. The program then calculates the surface area of each polygon, the distance between the nodes and the length of the sides between them using the Thiessen principle. The hydraulic conductivity can vary for each side of the polygons. The depth of the water table, the rainfall and salt concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other parameters can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule. = Hydrological data = SahysMod components The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface hydrology (like rainfall, potential evaporation, irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, runoff), and the aquifer hydrology (e.g., pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like actual evaporation, downward percolation, upward capillary rise, subsurface drainage, groundwater flow) are given as output. The quantity of drainage water, as output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data) and the height of the water table above the given drain level. This height results from the computed water balance Further, a drainage reduction factor can be applied to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options. To obtain accuracy in the computations of the ground water flow (sect. 2.8), the actual evaporation and the capillary rise, the computer calculations are done on a daily basis. For this purpose, the seasonal hydrological data are divided by the number of days per season to obtain daily values. The daily values are added to yield seasonal values. = Cropping patterns/rotations = The input data on irrigation, evaporation, and surface runoff are to be specified per season for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user: :A: irrigated land with crops of group A :B: irrigated land with crops of group B :U: non-irrigated land with rain-fed crops or fallow land Irrigated land The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of crops or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A-type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as sugarcane and rice. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugar cane, or perhaps trees and orchards. A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different seasons, e.g. A=wheat plus barley in winter and A=maize in summer while B=vegetables in winter and B=cotton in summer. Non-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U = 1‚àíA‚àíB and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made. Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal rotation of the different land uses over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation. This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes as explained When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 differs from the fraction A2, B2 and/or U2 in another season, because the irrigation regime changes in the different seasons, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1) but the crops and irrigation quantities may be different and may need to be proportionally adjusted. One may even specify irrigated land (A or B) with zero irrigation, which is the same as un-irrigated land (U). Cropping rotation schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices. Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance. = Soil strata, type of aquifer = SahysMod accepts four different reservoirs of which three are in the soil profile: :s: a surface reservoir, :r: an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone, :x: an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone, :q: a deep reservoir or main aquifer. The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth, from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be taken equal to the root zone. It can be saturated, unsaturated, or partly saturated, depending on the water balance. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Sahysmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.) The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are horizontal, except the flow to subsurface drains, which is radial. If a horizontal subsurface drainage system is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level). If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity. The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped wells, if present, receive their water from the aquifer only. The flow in the aquifer is determined in dependence of spatially varying depths of the aquifer, levels of the water table, and hydraulic conductivity. SahysMod permits the introduction of phreatic (unconfined) and semi-confined aquifers. The latter may develop a hydraulic over or under pressure below the slowly permeable top-layer (aquitard). = Agricultural water balances = Inflow and outflow factors of water into and out from the soil reservoirs needed to find the waterbalances The agricultural water balances are calculated for each soil reservoir separately as shown in the article Hydrology (agriculture). The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir. The three soil reservoirs can be assigned different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data. When, in a particular situation the transition zone or the aquifer is not present, they must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m. The depth of the water table at the end of the previous time step, calculated from the water balances, is assumed to be the same within each polygon. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into a larger number of polygons. Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water-balance components. For example, a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of capillary rise, actual evaporation, and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of percolation losses. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water-balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc. This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Sahysmod has been developed into a computer program, in which the computations are made day by day to account for the chain of reactions with a sufficient degree of accuracy. = Drains, wells, and re-use = Parameters of a horizontal subsurfce drainage system The sub-surface drainage can be accomplished through drains or pumped wells. The subsurface drains, if any, are characterized by drain depth and drainage capacity. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a drainage control factor. By installing a drainage system with zero capacity one obtains the opportunity to have separate water and salt balances in the transition above and below drain level. The pumped wells, if any, are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well discharge. The drain and well water can be used for irrigation through a (re)use factor. This may affect the water and salt balance and on the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency. = Salt balances = Graphic example of soil salinity trends in the transition zone The salt balances are calculated for each soil reservoir separately. They are based on their water balances, using the salt concentrations of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming groundwater in the aquifer. The concentrations are expressed in terms of electric conductivity (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -> 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste. In Sahysmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1. The principles used are correspond to those described in the article soil salinity control. Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different leaching efficiencies can be simulated varying their input value. If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinity, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (through the input), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated. The dissolution of solid soil minerals or the chemical precipitation of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method. However, but to some extent, it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the aquifer. In a future version, the precipitation of gypsum may be introduced. = Farmers' responses = If required, farmers' responses to waterlogging and soil salinity can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease: # The amount of irrigation water applied when the water table becomes shallower depending on the kind of crop (paddy rice and non-rice) # The fraction of irrigated land when the available irrigation water is scarce; # The fraction of irrigated land when the soil salinity increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a stochastic interpretation; # The groundwater abstraction by pumping from wells when the water table drops. The farmers' responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in turn, slows down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately a new equilibrium situation will arise. The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect first and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user. = Annual input changes = The program runs either with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year. The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, cropping rotations), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates a transfer file by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it also possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn randomly from a known rainfall probability distribution and to obtain a stochastic prediction of the resulting output parameters. Some input parameters should not be changed, like the nodal network relations, the system geometry, the thickness of the soil layers, and the total porosity, otherwise illogical jumps occur in the water and salt balances. These parameters are also stored in the transfer file, so that any impermissible change is overruled by the transfer data. In some cases of incorrect changes, the program will stop and request the user to adjust the input. Capillary rise with time Output data Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity Example of the polygonal mapping facilities using the depth of the watertable The output is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects. As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SahysMod includes frequency distributions in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program . The output data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly, through the user menu, that calls selected groups of data either for a certain polygon over time, or for a certain season over the polygons. The model includes mapping facilities of output data. Also, the program has the facility to store the selected data in a spreadsheet format for further analysis and for import into a GIS program. Different users may wish to establish different cause-effect relationships. The program offers only a limited number of standard graphics, as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made. This is the reason why the possibility for further analysis through spreadsheet programs was created. Although the computations need many iterations, all the end results can be checked by hand using the equations presented in the manual.

Background The Mohmands are a Pashtun tribe who inhabit the hilly country to the north-west of Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province of India, now Pakistan. British punitive expeditions had been sent against the Mohmands in 1851‚Äì1852, 1854, 1864, 1879, 1880, but the principal operations were those of 1897‚Äì1898. The year 1897 witnessed an almost general outbreak among the tribes on the north-west frontier of India. The tribes involved were practically independent, but the new frontier arranged with the amir of Afghanistan, and demarcated by Sir Mortimer Durand's commission of 1893‚Äì1894 (the Durand Line), brought them within the British sphere of influence. The fear of these tribes was annexation, and the hostility shown during the demarcation led to the Waziri expedition of 1894. Other causes, however, contributed to bring about the outbreak of 1897. The easy victory of the Turks over the Greeks in the Greco-Turkish War (1897) gave rise to excitement throughout the Muslim world, and the publication by the amir of Afghanistan, in his assumed capacity of king of Islam, of a religious work, in portions of which fanatical antipathy to Christians was thinly veiled, aroused a militant spirit among the border Mahommedans. The growing unrest was not recognized, and all appeared quiet, when, on 10 June 1897, a detachment of Indian troops escorting a British frontier officer was suddenly attacked during the mid-day halt in the Tochi Valley, where, since the Waziri expedition of 1894-95, certain armed posts had been retained by the government of India. On 29 July, with equal suddenness, the fortified posts at Chakdara and Malakand, in the Swat valley, which had been held since the Chitral expedition of 1895, were for several days fiercely assailed by the usually peaceful Swatis under the leadership of the Mad Mullah in the Siege of Malakand. On 8 August the village of Shabkadar (Shankarghar), within a few miles of Peshawar, and in British territory, was raided by the Mohmands, while the Afridis besieged the fortified posts on the Samana ridge, which had been maintained since the expeditions of 1888 and 1891. Finally, the Afridis, within a few days, captured all the British posts in the Khyber Pass. Campaign The Malakand Field Force commanded by Major-General Sir Bindon Blood was assembled at Nowshera. The post at Malakand was reached on 1 August, and on the following day Chakdara was relieved. The punishment of the Afridis was deferred till the preparations for the Tirah campaign could be completed. The Mohmands, however, could be immediately dealt with, and against them the two brigades of Sir Bindon Blood's division advanced from Malakand simultaneously with the movement of another division under Major-General Edmond Elles from Peshawar; it was intended that the two columns should effect a junction in Bajour. About 6 September the two forces advanced, and Major- General Blood reached Nawagai on 14 September, having detached a brigade to cross the Rambat Pass. This brigade being sharply attacked in camp at Markhanai at the foot of the pass on the night of the 14th, was ordered to turn northwards and punish the tribesmen of the Mamund valley. On the 15th Brigadier-General (afterwards Major-General) Jeffreys camped at Inayat Killa, and on the following day he moved up the Mamund valley in three columns, which met with strong resistance. A retirement was ordered, the tribesmen following, and when darkness fell the general, with a battery and a small escort, was cut off, and with difficulty defended some buildings until relieved. The casualties in this action numbered 149. This partial reverse placed General Blood in a position of some difficulty. He determined, however, to remain at Nawagai, awaiting the arrival of General Elles, and sent orders to General Jeffreys to prosecute the operations in the Mamund valley. From 18 to 23 September these operations were carried on successfully, several villages being burned, and the Mamunds were disheartened. Meanwhile, the camp at Nawagai was heavily attacked on the night of the 20th by about 4,000 men belonging to the Hadda Mullah's following. The attack was repulsed with loss, and on the 21st Generals Blood and Elles met at Lakarai. The junction having been effected, the latter, in accordance with the scheme, advanced to deal with the Upper Mohmands in the Jarobi and Koda Khel valleys, and they were soon brought to reason by his well-conducted operations. The work of the Peshawar division was now accomplished, and it returned to take part in the Tirah campaign. Its total casualties were about 30 killed and wounded. On the 22nd General Blood joined General Jeffreys, and on the 24th he started with his staff for Panjkora. On the 27th General Jeffreys resumed punitive operations in the Mamund valley, destroying numerous villages. On the 30th he encountered strong opposition at Agrah, and had 61 casualties. On 2 October General Blood arrived at Inayat Killa with reinforcements, and on the 5th the Mamunds tendered their submission. The total British loss in the Mamund valley was 282 out of a force which never exceeded 1,200 men. After marching into Buner, and revisiting the scenes of the Umbeyla campaign of 1863, the Malakand field-force was broken up on the 21st of January. The objects of the expedition were completely attained, in spite of the great natural difficulties of the country. The employment of imperial service troops with the Peshawar column marked a new departure in frontier campaigns. Participation of Winston Churchill Winston Churchill accompanied the expedition as a second lieutenant and war correspondent, and wrote his first non-fiction book on it, The Story of the Malakand Field Force.

Bartel was born in S≈Çawni√≥w village near Pilica. He was interested in aviation from his youth, and in 1911 he built his own gliders capable of short flights. In 1916, he enrolled in the Warsaw University of Technology, being one of three founders of the Aviation Section of that university's Students' Mechanical Club. In 1917, he completed a pilot course, and he joined the underground aviator organization (Warsaw was under German occupation at that time). In 1918, after Poland regained its independence, he volunteered for the Polish Air Force. He completed further military flying courses and he took part in the Polish- Soviet War, flying Breguet 14s in the 16th Reconnaissance Squadron and in the Central Lithuanian Air Squadron. He was demobilized in December 1920, and graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology in 1924 as an Engineer. He also took second place in the first Polish soaring competition in 1923. In 1925, his design of the Bartel BM-1 Maryla fighter aircraft received an award in the first Polish contest for military aircraft, but the design was not built. In 1924-1926 he worked in France, supervising production of aircraft for Poland and he also undertook research on aerodynamics there. From 1926, he was a chief designer of the Samolot aircraft manufacturer in Pozna≈Ñ. He designed and built there a prototype of a trainer aircraft, the Bartel BM-2 (1926), then trainers Bartel BM-4 (1927) and Bartel BM-5 (1928), built in small series for the Polish Air Force (the BM-4 was Poland's first domestic design that was put into production). From 1930 he worked in the Aviation Department of the Polish War Ministry, then, from 1932 to 1937, in the PZL aircraft works in Warsaw, which had obtained several of the Samolot projects upon that company's closure. His duties included overseeing aircraft production. During 1937-1939 he was a technical director for the Lubelska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w (LWS) works and supervised licensing some Polish designs to Romania and Turkey. During World War II he stayed in Poland and worked under the German occupation as a teacher in technical schools. After Poland's liberation in 1945, Bartel worked in the Polish Civil Aviation Department of Ministry of Communication, but in 1948, with the advent of Stalinism in Poland, the communist authorities removed him from work in aviation, along with many other pre-war experts. He worked among other places in the Polish Normalization Institute. From 1951 he was a professor at the Warsaw University of Technology. He retired in 1966. From the 1960s, his passion became the history of the Polish aviation industry. He was active in aviation associations such as the Polish Aero Club. He received the Knight's Cross of the Polonia Restituta and the Polish Cross of Merit (silver in 1927, gold in 1948). Bartel also held a Field Pilot Badge (1922).

Demotsis, 226 S.W.2d 673 (Tex. Civ. App. 1949), was a 1949 decision by the Texas Court of Appeals, United States which was an appeal from a judgment of the 57th judicial District Court of Bexar County, Texas. In the case, Batsakis (Plaintiff) sued Demotsis (Defendant) to collect on a promise Demotsis had made, in 1942 in war-torn Greece, to pay at a later date to Batsakis $2,000 dollars with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from April 2, 1942 in exchange for 500,000 drachmae given at the time of the execution of the contract. On appeal, the court found for Batsakis. Facts and case history In 1942, during the occupation of Greece by Nazi Germany in World War II, Demotsis was in severe financial straits. This period in Greek history was marked by extensive starvation and malnutrition. Hundreds of thousands of Greeks died as a result of wartime living conditions. According to scholars, the apparent contract made between the two parties would most likely have resulted in punishment or even death at the hands of the German occupiers as a black market transaction. Demotsis asked Batsakis for money, which she needed to buy food for her family. In exchange, Demotsis promised in writing (in the form of a letter) to give Batsakis $2,000 dollars, plus 8% annual interest, after the war, or sooner, if she was able to regain access to her assets in the United States (Demotsis held property and funds in Texas but had no direct access to them as a result of the war). In the putative letter from Demotsis to Batsakis, written in the Greek language, Demotsis stated that she had received $2,000 from Batsakis. The following is an English translation of the letter: > Piraeus - April 2, 1942 Mr. George Batsakis Konstantinou Diadohou #7 Piraeus > Mr. Batsakis: I state by my present (letter) that I received today from you > the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) of United States of America > money, which I borrowed from you for the support of my family during these > difficult days and because it is impossible for me to transfer dollars of my > own from America. The above amount I accept with the expressed promise that > I will return to you again in American dollars either at the end of the > present war or even before in the event you might be able to find a way to > collect them (dollars) from my representative in America whom I will write > and give him an order relative to this. You understand until the final > execution (payment) to the above amount an eight per cent interest will be > added and paid together with the principal. I thank you and I remain yours > with respects. The recipient, (Signed) Eugenia The. Demotsis. What she actually received however was 500,000 Greek drachmae, which had a market exchange value of approximately $25 at the time of the execution of the contract on account of massive hyperinflation. After Demotsis refused to repay the loan once the war was over, Batsakis sued and Demotsis asserted as her defense that the contract was unenforceable due to a lack of consideration (the element of exchange generally necessary to make a contract valid in common law systems) and that Batsakis's delivery of 500,000 drachmae, with a putative value of $25, could not be adequate consideration for her promise of $2,000, making the contract unenforceable. The trial court declared the contract enforceable and awarded Batsakis $750 plus interest and Batsakis appealed the judgment at which time the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision but modified the damages to $2,000 \\"with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum from April 2, 1942 and ordered that such judgment will bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum until paid on $2,000.00 thereof and on the balance interest at the rate of 6% per annum.\\" The Court of Appeals reasoned that the consideration given by Demotsis for Batsakis's promise of 500,000 drachmae could not be considered inadequate under state law as she had received \\"exactly what she contracted for.\\" The appellate court found the consideration legally sufficient and went on to state that the adequacy or inadequacy of the consideration did not bear on the enforceability, since mere inadequacy of consideration will not void a contract. The appellate court noted that, in common law systems including the American system, courts generally review the legal sufficiency of the consideration in a contract but have historically refused ordinarily to inquire into the adequacy of the consideration, whether the transaction was generally a fair or equivalent exchange.

At the time of his death he was the longest serving minister in post-revolution French history; only Louis XIV's Colbert served longer. Career until 1978 Boulin was born in Villandraut, Gironde. A Gaullist who joined the Free French movement in 1940, and rose to lead the movement in Navarre ‚Äì an achievement for which he was awarded the croix de guerre ‚Äì Boulin was known for his moderation; the courtesy with which he treated his political opponents led to a reputation as a skilled negotiator. Boulin's first ministerial position was as refugee minister in 1961, when France was winding up the Algerian war preparing to repatriate more than a million French settlers. Boulin served in the three governments following the establishment of the Fifth Republic in nine different posts; he occupied ministerial posts for fifteen years. His only break in ministerial service came from 1973 to 1976, when he was sidelined for having worked for Chaban-Delmas against Val√©ry Giscard in the presidential elections. Accusations in the Press In 1979, when he was being tipped as a successor to the unpopular Raymond Barre as Prime Minister of France, the satirical and investigative weekly Le Canard encha√Æn√© began to publish a series of articles that it said revealed Boulin had taken undue advantage of his position to obtain favourable terms on a series of real estate deals in the French Riviera. The paper printed photographs of letters on official ministry letterhead that purported to show that Boulin had tried to get government representatives in the region to authorize construction of 26 houses in an area where buildings were barred for environmental reasons, and that Boulin tried to get Henri Tournet, the property developer at the center of the scandal, promoted to the Legion of Honor. Further, according to the Le Canard encha√Æn√©, Tournet sold Boulin near Ramatuelle in 1974 that the developer had already sold to someone else. Boulin said he knew nothing of the dispute until 1978, but a letter quoted by the Canard seemed to indicate that the minister knew beforehand. The paper further claimed that Boulin had paid $8,000 for the land, a third of what the other buyer had paid a year earlier, and was able to get a building permit ‚Äì within a month, which was unusual ‚Äì in a wooded area where building had previously not taken place. Death and controversy On 29 October 1979, Boulin had lunch with his son Bertrand, and subsequently disappeared. Police found his body on the morning of 30 October in a pond in the forest of Rambouillet. Next to his car, which was parked nearby, was an empty container of barbiturates. In the car were envelopes addressed to Boulin's wife and to his colleagues at the Labor Ministry. Before the contents of the envelopes were known, top governmental leaders publicly accused Le Canard encha√Æn√© of being morally responsible for Boulin's death, and there were broad hints the government might use the reaction to the Boulin death to seek stricter libel laws, as was done in the 1930s after the suicide of Roger Salengro, the Socialist minister in L√©on Blum's Popular Front government, in 1936. Salengro was widely believed to have been hounded by Fascist weeklies. Jacques Chaban-Delmas, then President of the National Assembly, who had been politically identified with Boulin for many years, told a special memorial session of the assembly that it should \\"draw the lessons of this tragedy, of this assassination.\\" After meeting with President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Prime Minister Barre called for \\"meditation upon the consequences of certain ignominies\\", and spoke of \\"a baseness.\\" The president joined in the criticism: Boulin, said Giscard, \\"was unable to resist the campaign of harassment he was subjected to. Public opinion should severely condemn any other similar campaigns.\\" The release of letters found in his car and that he had mailed from a Paris suburb on the day of his death threw fuel on the flames of controversy, as he apparently posthumously accused his fellow Gaullists, especially Justice Minister Alain Peyrefitte of \\"obvious collusion\\" with those who were out to destroy him, whom he named as Henri Tournet, an \\"ambitious\\" investigating magistrate and \\"certain political circles from which my own political friends are, alas, not excluded\\" and implied that the then parliamentary majority was, in Boulin's phrase, \\"a basket of crabs.\\" In a separate note to the police, Boulin wrote \\"I have decided to drown myself in a lake in the forest, of Rambouillet, where I enjoyed riding horseback.\\" Before his death, Boulin also wrote letters to Agence France-Presse, Le Monde, his wife Collette, and to Chaban-Delmas. In the version published by Agence France-Presse, he accused a young Normandy judge of leaking details of the real estate case in an effort to seek personal publicity, and attacked the Minister of Justice: \\"this leaking of the secrets of the investigation failed to move a justice minister more concerned about his career than about the smooth functioning of justice.\\" Boulin alleged that the judge let the real estate operator go free after serving a month in jail in exchange for his cooperation in implicating the labor minister. The land agent, Henri Tournet, was \\"blackmailing\\" Boulin by trying to make it appear, untruthfully, that he knew beforehand that a building lot he bought from him on the French Riviera belonged to someone else, Boulin claimed. Boulin said that upon being freed from prison, Tournet went to Le Monde and Le Canard encha√Æn√©, \\"whose basic motivation is maliciousness.\\" Investigation Shortly after his death, the Boulin family declared that they did not accept the verdict of suicide and began waging a campaign in the press and the courts to re-open the case, which they believed was murder. On 22 October 1983, his body was ordered to be exhumed for an additional autopsy. The irregularities of the case were widely covered: that the lake in which he allegedly drowned was apparently nowhere more than one foot seven inches in depth; that Boulin's face had been badly battered and a cheek bone fractured, which went unmentioned in the official autopsy report; that the local doctor who signed the certificate was only allowed a hurried glimpse of the body which had already been transferred, on orders by high officials, to a waiting helicopter; that the jars containing Mr Boulin's lungs, necessary to confirm a death by drowning, disappeared mysteriously after someone broke into the laboratory fridge. At a press conference on 17 January 1984, the family accused the Versailles prosecutor of \\"wanting to hide the real cause of the death of Robert Boulin\\" and of \\"shielding the assassins from the law\\". The family was then prosecuted by the minister for justice for defaming a magistrate, and fined 800 francs; they were pardoned personally by Fran√ßois Mitterrand on his ascension to the Presidency a few weeks later. In September 1991, the Paris Public Prosecutor announced that he was closing the dossier opened in 1983; the family continued to accuse the Gaullist party of a cover- up, and possible implication in Boulin's death itself. The issue was re- ignited in January 2002 by a series of investigations televised on Canal Plus, in which Juliette Garrat, the doctor who performed the autopsy, said she was now sure that Mr Boulin's death was a \\"murder disguised as suicide\\" and the substitute prosecutor at the time also came forward to say \\"orders were given\\" by the authorities to stick to the verdict of suicide. On 21 June 2007, shortly after Jacques Chirac, also a Gaullist, handed over power to Nicolas Sarkozy, the Paris Public Prosecutor met with Boulin's daughter, Fabienne Burgeat, and announced that he was considering re-opening the investigation as \\"new evidence\\" had come to light. Popular culture Boulin was portrayed by Fran√ßois Berl√©and in the 2013 TV movie Crime D'Etat (lit. Crime of State) directed by Pierre Aknine.

He was also politician in Alberta, Canada serving briefly as a municipal councillor in Edmonton. Carey was born in Upper Canada in 1832. Intrigued by the opportunity to gain a fortune in gold, he was quickly drawn to the California Gold Rush, and later to British Columbia, where he prospected for gold along with his partner, Bill Cust. In the 1860s, the duo would make major discoveries of gold in the Parsnip River and in Peace River, leading to gold rushes when news spread of the discoveries. Carey later went into the fur trade, establishing himself at Peace River, and later, Lac la Biche. After spending a couple years in the fur trade, he went into the general merchant business, establishing stores in Manitoba, and later in Edmonton, North West Territories, where he would move to in 1882. Carey would operate the first store in the town, as well as a cattle business along with fellow merchant John Norris, until his retirement in the late 1890s. After his retirement he would live quietly in Edmonton as his health declined, leading up to his death in 1908. Regarded as one of the pioneer citizens of Edmonton and earliest settlers of Western Canada, Carey would later be interred at the Edmonton Cemetery. Early life and prospecting career =California and British Columbia= Bill Cust, Carey's prospecting partner Carey was born in London, Ontario in 1832, of Irish ancestry. After completing education in the area, he received word of the California Gold Rush, and being intrigued with the possibility of a fortune, Carey would head to there in 1849 to pan for gold. Carey would remain there until around 1858, gradually moving back north and ending up in the Fraser Valley area, where he partnered up with fellow prospector William (Bill) Cust (1823-1908), in search for gold in the Fraser River. It was also in British Columbia where Carey and Cust co-discovered the Omineca Gold Rush, when in 1861, Carey struck gold along the Parsnip River while prospecting in the area. Along with Cust, he would later operate a trading post at Rocky Mountain Portage. In 1862, the duo of Cust and Carey, along with Pete Toy another prospector from the Fraser Valley area, headed further north, to Peace River Country. =Peace River= At Peace River, Carey made the initial discovery of gold in Peace River; thereafter along with his partners, they made $50 a day for about six weeks, until they were forced to leave the area due to a lack of resources. Following their vacation of the area however, news had spread to several mining camps around the area and thus created a gold rush. Shortly after leaving the gold industry, Carey, who had remained Peace River area, went into the fur trading business, along with his prospector partner Bill Cust and three other locals. The partnership would continue for at least four years, when one of the partners, Mr. Brennan made off with the company's profits on four years worth of furs during a trip to Chicago. He later moved to the Lac La Biche area, where he again went into the fur trade. In 1874, he entered in a partnership with an American businessman, Mr. Johnson, whom he met when he was travelling from Winnipeg to Edmonton. They would purchase stores in the Assiniboia area and engage in the fur trade in the Lesser Slave Lake area. Career in Edmonton Edmonton Board of Trade, 1891. Edward Carey is seated in the middle row, fourth left. Carey moved to permanently settle in Edmonton around 1882. Upon settling, he would purchase land which would later become the neighbourhood of Abbotsfield.http://www.edmonton.ca/for_residents/2006_DEMOGRAPHIC_Abbottsfield.pdf In Edmonton, he established a general store on Hardisty Avenue along the trail connecting Edmonton with St. Albert, which was the first privately owned store in the town. He would later partner with another businessman, John A. Norris, and enter the cattle ranching business, importing cattle from as far as Montana to sell. Norris later joined Carey as a partner in his general store, and the store would be known as Norris & Carey, selling mainly groceries and hardware. In 1892, Carey was elected as an alderman to Edmonton's first Town Council, finishing third of fourteen candidates (the top six were elected) with 124 votes. He did not seek re-election in 1893, and did not engage in politics thereafter. He was also an early member of the Edmonton Board of Trade, serving as its inaugural vice president in 1889. In 1897, he retired from his business interests and returned to his Edmonton home. Death and legacy Carey died September 10, 1908 at his home in Edmonton, less a month after the death of his former prospecting partner Bill Cust. He had been in poor health since suffering a stroke of paralysis 14 years previous. His funeral was held at First Presbyterian Church in Edmonton; it was attended by many local dignitaries and notables including James Ross, Henry William McKenney, Daniel Maloney, William Antrobus Griesbach, Daniel R. Fraser, as well as former mayors Matthew McCauley, Cornelius Gallagher, and sitting Mayor John Alexander McDougall. Prior to the service, a procession to the church was led by the Edmonton Citizens' Marching Band. He was interred at the Edmonton Cemetery on September 14. He was survived by a son, Edward, of Andrew, Alberta, and a daughter, Mrs. George Hutton, of Edmonton. Regarded as a pioneer citizen of Edmonton and Western Canada,\\"Pioneer Merchant of Edmonton Passes Away\\", Winnipeg Free Press, Saturday, September 12, 1908, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada an obituary in the Edmonton Bulletin described Carey as a \\"genuine old timer, a distinct species of the race, one of nature's noblemen, who would do anything in the world for a friend and who scarcely knew what it was to have an enemy.\\" A series of roads, Carey Crescent, Carey Way, Carey Lane, and Carey Close, all located within the Cameron Heights neighbourhood in Edmonton (named after fellow council member John Cameron) are named for Edward Carey.http://webdocs.edmonton.ca/InfraPlan/NameAddress/minutes&agendas;/5%20June%2021%202006%20Agenda%20Mgt.pdf References Category:1832 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Canadian people of Irish descent Category:Canadian gold prospectors Category:Canadian fur traders Category:Edmonton city councillors Category:Politicians from London, Ontario ","title":"Edward Carey"},{"id":"11890545","text":"The Ant and Bee stories are a series of small-format hardback books written by Angela Banner (pseudonym of Angela Mary Maddison [nee Lincke], 1923-2014).The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature She began writing the books in order to teach her son how to read.

Early life Orland \\"O.K.\\" Armstrong was born in Willow Springs, Missouri, the third of nine children. His father, Reverend William Armstrong, was a schoolteacher and minister. The family moved frequently around southern Missouri as his father changed teaching jobs or founded new churches. Finally in 1907 the family settled in Carterville, Missouri and it was from Carterville High School that Orland graduated as valedictorian in 1912. Armstrong attended Drury College in Springfield, Missouri graduating summa cum laude in 1916 with a bachelor's degree in education. Armstrong's first teaching position came at Southwest Baptist College in Bolivar, Missouri, where he taught English and served as basketball coach. Southwest Baptist was a natural fit for Armstrong for it was his maternal grandfather, Reverend Daniel Preston, who was one of the college founders.Dictionary of Missouri: Biography, Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999 With America's entry into World War I in April 1917 Armstrong took a leave of absence to serve in the U.S. Army. Assigned to the Army Signal Corps, he received pilot training and would serve as an instructor pilot for the duration of the war. While serving as an instructor pilot Armstrong made his first foray into the world of journalism by acting as editor of the aviation magazine Propeller. Following the end of World War I Armstrong took a position with the YMCA, going to France for two years. In France he helped care for Russian prisoners of war awaiting return to their homeland. After returning from France in 1920 Armstrong chose to further his education at Cumberland University, earning his second bachelor's degree and a law degree in 1922. Armstrong took and passed the Missouri Bar exam but chose not to enter into a law practice. He instead enrolled in the University of Missouri, where he earned both a bachelor's and master's degree in journalism in 1925. Resuming his role as an educator, Orland Armstrong founded the University of Florida School of Journalism. In addition to his teaching positions, Armstrong had worked as a freelance journalist for several newspapers and national magazines since the mid-1920s. One which gained him notoriety was a rare 1927 interview with Charles Lindberg for Boys' Life magazine. The two aviators, both with Missouri ties, became lifelong friends thereafter. Politics Returning to Missouri in 1929, Orland Armstrong first entered politics the next year in an unsuccessful run for a seat in the state senate. Armstrong tried again in 1932 and, in a year dominated by Democratic landslides from the White House to the state house, became one of only ten Republicans elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. He would serve in the House until 1936 and then again from 1942 to 1944. Armstrong would continue his journalism career even while in the state legislature, some of his reporting would have national ramifications. A series of investigative articles in 1934 into political boss Tom Pendergast, gambling, and corruption in the Kansas City political machine. Pendergast at the time was the primary supporter of Harry S. Truman, who would become U.S. President in 1945. The articles would lead to Armstrong's appointment as a special investigator by Missouri governor Lloyd Stark in 1938, and his testimony the following year before a Jackson county grand jury looking into the Pendergast machine's activities. With the advent of World War II, Armstrong expressed isolationist views and was among the earliest to join with his friend Charles Lindberg in the America First Committee. However, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor he wholeheartedly came out in support of the American war effort. Armstrong was elected to the Missouri House again in 1942 but chose not to seek reelection to the seat in 1944, instead running for Missouri Lieutenant Governor, an election which he lost. From 1944 until 1950 Orland Armstrong served in a variety of appointed governmental roles, including the U.S. Senate committee on the Post Office and civil service. In 1950 Armstrong was elected to his only term in the U.S. Congress. Although just a freshman legislator, he still managed to create an international incident. While on a fact-finding trip to the Far East and Taiwan in 1951 Armstrong met with Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek on a plan to bring Nationalist forces into the Korean War, a plan strongly opposed by President Truman's administration. Then during the Japanese Allied Peace Conference, Armstrong had a public and very heated exchange of words with the Soviet Union's chief delegate Andrei Gromyko over slave labor camps. Although Gromyko denied the charges, the exchange put a further chill in the Cold War and hampered U.S. diplomatic efforts to bring Soviet influence on North Korean and communist Chinese leadership in hopes of achieving a peace agreement in Korea. Due to Congressional redistricting following the 1950 census, in 1952 Armstrong would have been forced to run against friend and fellow Republican Dewey Jackson Short. Rather than do so he did not seek re-election in 1952. Armstrong was selected by old friend John Foster Dulles to be Director of Publicity for the U.S. State Department, however before he could take the position it came to light he was under criminal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. Eventually convicted on three counts of tax evasion, Armstrong paid a large sum in back taxes and penalties but avoided jail time. In 1965 the Internal Revenue Service ruled that Armstrong had not intentionally defrauded the government, and refunded to him nearly $12,000 in overpayments on his income taxes, the fines he had previously paid, and interest. Armstrong mounted two more unsuccessful campaigns for public office, in 1966 and 1982, failing in attempts to return to the Missouri House. Life after politics Orland Armstrong continued his work as a journalist the remainder of his life. Employed by Reader's Digest in various capacities since the mid-1940s, he is credited with writing over 125 articles for the magazine as well as serving on their editorial board. His articles, some written under pen names, often crusaded for civil rights, decried the growing national debt, and spoke out about the evils of pornography. In 1970 he helped create the Springfield Citizens Council for Decency, an anti-pornography group in Springfield, Missouri. Personal life Orland Armstrong was twice-married. He met first wife, Louise McCool, while visiting and briefly working for his parents in Florida in 1920. They married in 1922 and would have five children. Louise Armstrong died of cancer in 1947. Two years later in 1949 he married friend and fellow writer Marjorie Moore and they would remain married until his death. Orland K.

The two examples built were used to provide the first heavier-than-air airline service anywhere in the world, and the first airline service of any kind at all in the United States. Design and development The aircraft was a conventional biplane with equal-span unstaggered wings with small pontoons at their tips. The engine was mounted on a pedestal aft of the cockpit and drove a two-blade pusher propeller. Accommodation for the pilot and single passenger was side by side in an open cockpit. Operational history The first example, given Benoist construction number 43 and named Lark of Duluth, carried joyriders over the harbour at Duluth, Minnesota through the Summer of 1913, but the endeavor was not a commercial success. The repairs and paint job left the aircraft with the partial name, \\"of Du\\". Later that year, Percival Fansler, a business associate of designer Thomas W. Benoist, convinced Benoist to join him in establishing a scheduled air service between the Florida cities of St Petersburg and Tampa. Their newly formed company, the St. Petersburg‚ÄìTampa Airboat Line purchased the Lark of Duluth and another Benoist XIV to inaugurate operations. The first scheduled flight between the two cities departed shortly before 10:00 a.m. on January 1, 1914, piloted by Tony Jannus and carried former St Petersburg mayor Abram C. Pheil as its passenger for the , 23-minute flight. Regular tickets were priced at $5.00 (equivalent to $ in ), but Pheil had paid $400.00 ($ in ) at auction for the ticket for the first crossing. Over the next three months of the airline's short lifetime, the Lark of Duluth and her near-sister Florida (construction number 45) carried 1,205 passengers over Tampa Bay. At the end of March, however, the city subsidy ran out, and it proved no longer profitable to continue the service. The Lark of Duluth spent the remainder of 1914 carrying joyriders in several locations around the United States, including Duluth, Conneaut Lake, and San Diego. At this latter location it was damaged in a hard landing and pronounced unsalvageable. Variants * In 1984, a full-scale flying replica was constructed by Florida Aviation Historical Society for the 70th anniversary of the flight. This aircraft is now on loan to the St. Petersburg Museum of History in St. Petersburg, Florida. * A second replica of the 1913 Lark of Duluth was constructed by the Duluth Aviation Institute and FAA certified to commemorate the 100th anniversary of commercial aviation. Recreation A full-scale replica of the Model XIV is being built by Kermit Weeks at Fantasy of Flight that they plan on flying on the centennial of Tony Jannus' first scheduled commercial flight on January 1, 2014.

Most of the school's 252 students are in grades 8-12. As of 2020, school review website Niche ranks Delphian School as the third best boarding high school, fourth best private high school and sixth most diverse private high school in the state of Oregon. Campus and history In the fall of 1976, the Delphian School opened on the site of a former a Jesuit novitiate near Sheridan, Oregon. The main building on campus is a four-story, Art Deco-style building with a brick exterior that was designed by Poole & McGonigle and built in 1933 for the Jesuit house. There were about 60 students enrolled in the school's first year. Two years later in 1978 the school had 120 students, tuition was $4,500 for boarding students and $2,800 for non-boarders. In the mid-1980s the campus was considered as a possible location for a federal prison. The Sheridan Federal Correctional Institution opened in 1989 in another location in the area. Academics The Delphian School uses a proficiency-based education model, where students advance through the curriculum by demonstrating proficiency or competence rather than at a set time. Profiles of the school mention the applied focus of the curriculum and its ‚Äúhighly disciplined and self-directed approach,‚Äù as well as its transformation of the traditional grading system. In addition to its K-12 curriculum, the school is licensed by the nonprofit group Applied Scholastics to teach its students to use the study techniques, known as Study Tech, developed by L. Ron Hubbard, a point of some controversy in profiles of the school. Delphian is a member of the Oregon Federation of Independent Schools (OFIS), an organization that safeguards educational choice; it is an accredited member of the Northwest Association of Independent Schools, one of the Northwest‚Äôs major accrediting groups; and it is an accredited member of Cognia, a standards-based accreditation body. Activities The Delphian School's sports team is known as the \\"Dragons\\". The school participates in the Oregon School Activities Association's (OSAA) Northwest League, 2A classification, for girls and boys basketball, tennis, cross country, track and field, boys soccer, volleyball, cheerleading, solo music, and choir. In 2014 the Delphian choir tied for the OSAA Choir State Championship, and three school soccer players were named to the All-State team. In 2013 a student was chosen as the youth delegate to Youth for Human Rights International.

Plot While lecturing in Brazil, Dr. Taylor Briggs, an American authority on memory, consults on a patient found deep in the Amazon. During the exam, Taylor is accidentally exposed to a mysterious substance which unlocks a series of memories in his brain. Memories that are not his. The memory of a killer who committed crimes before Taylor was even born. A killer who is much closer than you may think. The mystery will rip open Taylor Briggs's well crafted life, estranging his relationship with his best friend Dr. Deepra Chang, leading him into romance with a beautiful, enigmatic painter Stephanie Jacobs, straining his relationship with his mom's best friend Carol Hargrave, causing him to question the surrogate father figure in his life, Dr. Max Lichtenstein.  Cast  *Billy Zane as Taylor Briggs *Tricia Helfer as Stephanie Jacobs *Ann-Margret as Carol Hargrave *Dennis Hopper as Max Lichtenstein *Terry Chen as Dr. Deepra Chang *Dan Pelchat as Spectre *Emily Hirst as Bonnie McHale Writers' comments ‚ÄúMemory is really about seeing through someone else‚Äôs eyes‚Äù says writer /producer /director/ novelist Bennett Davlin. ‚Äúand doing it in a way that uses cutting edge science‚Äù. One of the minority investors, Dr. Robert Voogt, a leading head injury/ Alzheimer's expert explains that ‚ÄúI was consulted on the film and loved the story so much I invested in the movie. All the science used is accurate.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat attracted me most to the project was being able to see through someone else‚Äôs eyes‚Äù explains actor Billy Zane who catapulted to fame in the top-grossing movie ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù. ‚ÄúTaylor,‚Äù explains Zane ‚Äúis a good guy who now has the memories of committing horrible acts. It opposites, a good and very bad person getting slammed together in one mind that made it most interesting.‚ÄùMemory' at the official Echo Bridge Entertainments website ‚ÄúDeepra is the level headed one,‚Äù explains Terry Chen, ‚Äúalways using grounded science to explain away this whole thing. In a way he gets to be the audience second guessing Taylor.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey grew up together, so these are best friends with history that goes all the way back to the baseball fields of their youth‚Äù. ‚ÄúCarol is a real loner‚Äù, explains two time Oscar nominee Ann-Margret, ‚Äúa quiet, contained person who‚Äôs always been there for Taylor, but yet is always on the periphery of his life: standing in the background watching from afar.‚ÄùMemory (2006) The Movie ‚ÄúMax,‚Äù explains two time Oscar nominee Dennis Hopper, ‚Äúis a guy whose wife has died and he‚Äôs sort of coasting through life a bit like a ghost. But it‚Äôs a really warm relationship that he has with Taylor‚Äîsomething genuine and real.‚Äù ‚ÄúStephanie,‚Äù explains Tricia ‚Äúhas painted this image that is exactly like what Taylor is seeing she‚Äôs a woman with conflicts that run so deep; she can‚Äôt even quite touch them. It gives her character a constant state of tension which was something that made all her scenes so interesting‚Äù.Memory The Movie on Variety  About the production  Bennett Davlin wrote the novel first with the intention of directing and producing the film. ‚ÄúThese characters were so real to me that I just knew I had to bring them to the big screen‚Äù. ‚ÄúOne of the most appealing things to me,‚Äù explains Billy Zane ‚Äúis that so much of Taylor is internalized. He says very little, but we‚Äôre in his head the whole time.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hate dialogue,‚Äù co- writer Anthony Badalucco adds, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs much more interesting to see Taylor doing things that explain and explore his psyche than for him to babble his thought aloud in some exposition‚Äù. After viewing George Lucas's ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù at the age of 6, Bennett Davlin knew he wanted to direct films. By the time he had started his professional career as a screenwriter, he had made hundreds of films and written sixteen novels before he was seventeen years old. ‚ÄúBy writing novels and making films, I have a profound respect for creating real worlds with real people and doing it as quickly and succinctly as possible. Books demand details. Films demand pacing. It‚Äôs a great combination.‚Äùvideo.de  Videofilm  Memory - Wenn Gedanken t√∂ten ‚ÄúWe have been very lucky to get such a marvelous cast together‚Äù says executive producer Robert J. Monroe. ‚ÄúI especially adore Ann-Margret who just lights up the screen. Dennis is amazing. And Billy is fantastic as Taylor. He‚Äôs in practically every scene of the film too.‚Äù ‚ÄúMemory turned out to be a difficult novel to interpret on the screen,‚Äù explains Davlin, ‚Äúso I turned to my producing and writing partner Anthony Badalucco for help. He helped breathe a real breath of fresh air into the work.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe made a lot of changes,‚Äù explains Badalucco, ‚Äúall the while trying to keep the audience in Taylor‚Äôs head. I wanted the audience to be one with him.‚Äù ‚ÄúDavlin storyboards everything,‚Äù explains associate producer Jeannette Weinstein, ‚Äúand then shoots the storyboards and adds sound to create a complete animatic. This film was totally organized and a pleasure to work on‚Äù.3210Films Memory site ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to waste people‚Äôs time,‚Äù explains Davlin, ‚Äúand we were trying to make a small independent film look like a big budget movie. I also didn‚Äôt want to look like an idiot, standing around figuring out how to shoot or stage something.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll that preparation,‚Äù says cinematographer Peter Benison ‚Äúgives this movie a polish that you just don‚Äôt find in independent film.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like working with a young Alfred Hitchcock,‚Äù explains associate producer Jeannette Weinstein, ‚Äúhe lets his cast and crew in on the storyboards, so it‚Äôs a very quick and collaborative effort‚Äù. ‚ÄúBecause the material was based on a novel,‚Äù explains Terry Chen, ‚Äúthere was a lot to pull from that wasn‚Äôt even in the script. I‚Äôm talking about rich details that can only exist in a novel. But this whole shared history between these characters was so intimate and interwoven. It gave the cast so much to subconsciously pull from.‚Äù Then there is that bathroom that gets wiped out by a tidal wave. ‚ÄúIt was a nightmare,‚Äù explains screenwriter Anthony Badalucco, ‚Äúthe water tank had to be rebuilt and rebuilt. It was one of those technical things you just couldn‚Äôt control. But the shot is amazing when you see it on screen.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a miracle we got that shot,‚Äù Davlin smiles, ‚Äúhell, it‚Äôs amazing we finished the thing on that budget and still kept all the details I wanted to bring to the screen.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love the lair that‚Äôs revealed at the end,‚Äù explains Weinstein, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a totally different place, more of an art installation than a killer‚Äôs lair.‚ÄùMemory The Movie on IF Magazine  References   External links   Category:2006 films Category:2006 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Anthony Marinelli Category:Memory in fiction Category:American psychological thriller films ","title":"Memory (2006 film)"},{"id":"11890660","text":"The Bean eater (Italian: Mangiafagioli) is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter Annibale Carracci.

Alan Fox failed his eleven plus examination and -- like most British working class children of his generation -- left school at the age of 14. He worked first as a laboratory assistant at a grammar school and then in a photographic film factory. When the Second World War broke out, Fox joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and applied for aircrew training, but was rejected due to poor eyesight.Halsey He served initially as a ground staff photographer in India and Burma, with the rank of Corporal. He volunteered for service as an aerial photographer with No. 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which undertook hazardous missions over Japanese-held areas, using North American Mitchell aircraft. Fox, who was promoted to Sergeant, received the Distinguished Flying Medal (RAF). After the war, Fox worked for the Forestry Commission in Scotland. In 1947-48, he undertook a diploma in public administration at Ruskin College, an independent institution in Oxford. Fox then entered the University of Oxford, where he spent the majority of his academic career, studying economics and political science at Exeter College. In 1950, while lecturing at Ruskin, he completed a Bachelor of Letters (B.Litt.) thesis on the history of industrial relations in the Black Country.Halsey That same year, Fox married Margaret Dow, with whom he had two sons. In 1958, he became a research fellow at Nuffield College and in 1963, he became a lecturer at Nuffield, in the Department of Social and Administrative Studies. Fox rose to prominence with a 1966 paper, Industrial Sociology And Industrial Relations, written for the Donovan Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations (1965‚Äì68). In it he described the dominance in industrial relations of two, rival ideological/theoretical perspectives.Tony Topham, \\"Alan Fox\\" [obituary, The Guardian, Tuesday 6 August 2002.

For the other perspective, he used an existing term from political science: \\"pluralist\\", a perspective which suggests that multiple parties are involved in decision-making. However, Fox himself was strongly influenced by a third major theoretical position: the \\"radical\\" perspective, especially Marxism.Topham With Allan Flanders and Hugh Clegg, Fox became prominent in a group of scholars known collectively as the \\"Oxford school of industrial relations\\". Although the Oxford school was frequently associated with pluralism, during the 1970s Fox adopted an overtly radical position. In \\"Industrial relations: a social critique of pluralist ideology\\" (1973) and Beyond Contract (1974), he suggested that unitarism and pluralism, in practice, were often combined and/or difficult to distinguish.

It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky and is the day with the longest period of daylight. Within the Arctic circle (for the northern hemisphere) or Antarctic circle (for the southern hemisphere), there is continuous daylight around the summer solstice. On the summer solstice, Earth's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44¬∞. Likewise, the Sun's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44¬∞. The summer solstice occurs during summer. This is the June solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and the December solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Depending on the shift of the calendar, the summer solstice occurs sometime between June 20 and June 22 in the Northern Hemisphere and between December 20 and December 23 in the Southern Hemisphere. The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the winter solstice. Since prehistory, the summer solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals. Traditionally, in many temperate regions (especially Europe), the summer solstice is seen as the middle of summer and referred to as \\"midsummer\\". Today, however, in some countries and calendars it is seen as the beginning of summer. Distinctions Diagram of the Earth's seasons as seen from the north. Far left: summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere. Front right: summer solstice for the Southern Hemisphere. Although the summer solstice is the longest day of the year for that hemisphere, the dates of earliest sunrise and latest sunset vary by a few days. This is because the Earth orbits the Sun in an ellipse, and its orbital speed varies slightly during the year. Although the Sun appears at its highest altitude from the viewpoint of an observer in outer space or a terrestrial observer outside tropical latitudes, the highest altitude occurs on a different day for certain locations in the tropics, specifically those where the Sun is directly overhead (maximum 90 degrees elevation) at the subsolar point. This day occurs twice each year for all locations between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn because the overhead Sun appears to cross a given latitude once before the day of the solstice and once afterward. For example, Lahaina Noon occurs in May and July in Hawaii. See solstice article. For all observers, the apparent position of the noon Sun is at its most northerly point on the June solstice and most southerly on the December solstice. Full moon 2016 was the first time in nearly 70 years that a full moon and the Northern Hemisphere's summer solstice occurred on the same day. The 2016 summer solstice's full moon rose just as the Sun set. Cultural aspects The significance given to the summer solstice has varied among cultures, but most recognize the event in some way with holidays, festivals, and rituals around that time with themes of religion or fertility. For example, in Sweden, midsummer is one of the year's major holidays when the country closes down as much as during Christmas. In some regions, the summer solstice is seen as the beginning of summer and the end of spring. In other cultural conventions, the solstice is closer to the middle of summer.

The town is on the Tropic of Capricorn(Shadow directly below the sign) Solstice is derived from the Latin words sol (Sun) and sistere (to stand still). Date Date of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice over time. The ~25 drops per century are leap years when the date shifts back one day due to the insertion of February 29. There was no leap year in 1800 or 1900, which explains why there is no drop those years.

They are now in the collections of Christ Church Picture Gallery, Oxford, and the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.Kimbell Art Museum, Butchers Shop a film by Philip Haas Annibale Carracci, The Butcher's Shop, early 1580s, Kimbell Art Museum, 23 1/2 √ó 27 15/16 in. (59.7 √ó 71 cm) The paintings are connected to the contemporary Beaneater (Galleria Colonna), as they are very early examples of Italian genre painting. The large size of the Christ Church painting is exceptional for such a subject at this date, and it has been suggested they were commissioned by a butcher's guild, or for use as a sign. Carracci was influenced in his depiction of everyday life subjects by Vincenzo Campi and Bartolomeo Passarotti, whom the Butcher's Shop was originally attributed to. Carracci's ability to adapt his style is demonstrated, making it \\"lower\\" when concerning \\"lower\\", quasi-satirical subjects like the Mangiafagioli and the Butcher's Shop, while in his more academic works (such as the roughly contemporary Assumption of the Virgin) he was able to use a more finished manner with the same ease. It is claimed that members of the painter's family were used as models. Significant alterations to some figures are revealed by X-rays, and the hand on the edge of the table, now apparently belonging to the old woman, though not in proportion with the rest of her, may have originally belonged to the butcher to the right of her. The Christ Church painting was in the collections of the Gonzaga Dukes of Mantua and Charles I of England; after reaching Christ Church it was hung for a long time in the college kitchen, before being recognised for what it was in the 20th century.

Trebeigh Manor Trebeigh, St Ive, in Cornwall was a manor listed in Domesday Book as held by the Earl of Mortain, the largest landholder in that county. He is said to have taken it away wrongfully from the church. It was given in 1150 by King Stephen to the Knights Templar, and thenceforth formed, together with that order's other nearby manor of Temple on Bodmin Moor, the Preceptory of Trebeigh, which also held the advowson of the parish church of St Ive.

Area middle schools that feed into Perry Hall High are Perry Hall Middle School and Pine Grove Middle School.  Structure  When initially established, Perry Hall High School was located in the building, which today is Perry Hall Middle School. The class of 1968 was the first class to graduate from the new and current building located just down the road. In 1973 construction started on a small addition to the front of the building.Hallmark Newspaper Vol. 10, No. 5. This first addition was built adjacent to the library. Nine new classrooms were built to accommodate 350 more students and four new teachers. Renovations that took place in the same year included a team locker room, new biology, and chemistry labs, and an addition to the faculty dining room. A three-story new addition had to be built in 1997 to fight overcrowding..Councilman Vincent Gardina The new section has health and career education classrooms below ground level, tall music rooms and social science rooms at ground level, and foreign language and art rooms on the second floor. Because of the tall music rooms, the second floor of the new addition is a half story higher than the second floor of the main building. Currently, there are portable classrooms situated outside the main building to alleviate the continuing overpopulation problem. The most recent addition was a hallway around the auditorium to alleviate the crowded junction on the first floor between the old and new wings.

The doors opened on September 6 to sophomores and juniors, taking students that would have otherwise attended Parkville High School or Overlea High School. The first principal of Perry Hall High School was Maynard E. Keadle. Perry Hall High School's first graduates were members of the class of 1965. Within five years, a second building was constructed to accommodate the high number of students in the area. The new building opened in the fall of 1967 to Perry Hall High School students while the original building became Perry Hall Junior High School, known as Perry Hall Middle School today. In 1987, the movie Hairspray was filmed at Perry Hall High School. =Overcrowding= A new lobby constructed with the addition. A new addition replaced portable classrooms at Perry Hall High School in 1997, but by 2003 portable classrooms were needed once again. In 2005, a new hallway was built to try to ease the overcrowded hallways. With Perry Hall High School being the most populated school in the Baltimore County public school system, the Perry Hall Improvement Association has started a petition to gather support for a new high school to be constructed in northeast Baltimore County. =2012 shooting= A shooting occurred at the Perry Hall cafeteria on the first day of school at 10:45 a.m., Monday, August 27, 2012. The shooter, 15-year-old sophomore student Robert Gladden, Jr., attended the first two classes and then went to the school restroom during break time, where he allegedly reassembled a 16 gauge shotgun from his backpack and loaded it. He exited the restroom with the shotgun hidden under his clothing and pulled it out in the cafeteria, where he fired a shot that struck a 17-year-old male student in the back, critically wounding him. A school guidance counselor, Jesse Wasmer, and Richard Rosenthal, a mathematics teacher, immediately rushed to Gladden and attempted to subdue him. More faculty members rushed the shooter, who fired into the ceiling during the struggle. Several people suffered minor cuts and bruises during the panic that ensued. Students were evacuated to a nearby shopping center and middle school. In February 2013, Gladden was sentenced to 35 years in prison on charges of attempted murder.

TAS2R38 is a bitter taste receptor; varying genotypes of TAS2R38 influence the ability to taste both 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Though it has often been proposed that varying taste receptor genotypes could influence tasting ability, TAS2R38 is one of the only taste receptors shown to have this function.  Signal transduction  As with all TAS2R proteins, TAS2R38 utilizes the G-protein gustducin as its primary method of signal transduction. Both the Œ±- and Œ≤Œ≥-subunits are crucial to the transmission of the taste signal. See: taste receptor.  PTC sensitivity  Differential ability to taste the bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) was discovered more than 80 years ago. Since then, PTC tasting ability has been mapped to chromosome 7q and, several years later, was shown to be directly related to TAS2R38 genotype. There are three common polymorphisms in the TAS2R38 gene‚ÄîA49P, V262A, and I296VdnSNP: rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939‚Äîwhich combine to form two common haplotypes and several other very rare haplotypes. The two common haplotypes are AVI (often called ‚Äúnontaster‚Äù) and PAV (often called ‚Äútaster‚Äù). Varying combinations of these haplotypes will yield homozygotes‚ÄîPAV/PAV and AVI/AVI‚Äîand heterozygotes‚ÄîPAV/AVI. These genotypes can account for up to 85% of the variation in PTC tasting ability: people possessing two copies of the PAV polymorphism report PTC to be more bitter than TAS2R38 heterozygotes, and people possessing two copies of the AVI/AVI polymorphism often report PTC as being essentially tasteless. These polymorphisms are hypothesized to affect taste by altering G-protein-binding domains. Because bitter substances are usually toxic, the presence of a ‚Äúnontaster‚Äù geno- and phenotype seems evolutionarily undesirable. Several studies have suggested, however, that the AVI polymorphism may code for an entirely new receptor which processes a different and as-yet undiscovered bitter compound. Furthermore, the presence of the nontaster allele may reflect the desirability of maintaining a mostly heterozygous population; this group of people may possess flexibility in their bitter taste perception, enabling them to avoid a greater number of toxins than either homozygotic group. Other studies, however, suggest that the AVI nontaster genotype has no functional ligand. For an evolutionary perspective, the reference sequences for gorillas and chimps have the PAV haplotype, while mouse and rat have PAI.VAR_017860VAR_017861VAR_017862 This genotypical alteration of taste phenotype is currently unique to TAS2R38. Though genotype has been proposed as a mechanism for determining individual taste preferences, TAS2R38 is so far the first and only taste receptor to display this property. PROP sensitivity, supertasting, and alcoholism The TAS2R38 protein also confers sensitivity to the bitter compound 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP). Because perception of PROP bitterness has been associated with supertasting, and because TAS2R38 genotypes associate with PROP-tasting phenotypes, it has been proposed that TAS2R38 genotypes may have a role in supertasting capabilities. It appears that while TAS2R38 genotypes determine a threshold of PROP tasting abilities, the genotypes cannot account for the differences in tasting amongst each threshold group. For example, some PAV/PAV homozygotes perceive PROP to be more bitter than others, and TAS2R38 genotype cannot account for these differences. Furthermore, some heterozygotes may become PROP supertasters (despite a lack of two PAV alleles), indicating overlap between PROP bitterness levels and varying TAS2R38 genotypes. These results illustrate that a mechanism beyond TAS2R38 genotype contributes to supertasting capabilities. Because fungiform papillae (FP) number varies with PROP bitterness, TAS2R38 genotype was also suspected to alter FP number. Again, however, TAS2R38 genotype could not explain FP alterations. Additionally, FP number was not a strong predictor of PROP bitterness amongst TAS2R38 heterozygotes, indicating, again, a lack of knowledge about the relationship between PROP bitterness, TAS2R38, and supertasting. Research is leaning toward a second receptor with PROP sensitivity that confers supertasting abilities. PROP bitterness and TAS2R38 genotype have been further examined in relation to alcohol intake. Research has suggested that the level of alcohol consumption may correlate with the level of perceived bitterness of ethanol; those people who find PROP to be more bitter also find the taste of ethanol to be less pleasant. Again, however, correlates between TAS2R38 genotype and the taste of alcohol were not significant: the TAS2R38 genotype could not predict the intensity of alcohol bitterness (though PROP bitterness did correlate with alcohol bitterness). Genotype could predict alcohol intake; those with nontaster alleles were more likely to consume more alcohol over the course of the year. Again, a second genetic factor seems to contribute to these phenomena. A gene altering the density of fungiform papillae may provide this second factor.

Dating from c. 1604, it remains in the palace for which it was painted in Rome as part of the collection of the Galleria Doria Pamphilj. The painting, depicting the biblical New Testament event of the Flight into Egypt, was commissioned in 1603 by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini for the family chapel in his palace in Rome, later known as Palazzo Doria Pamphilj. The commission includes six paintings in six lunettes, which were executed by Carracci and his pupils (including Francesco Albani, Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco).Martin, 317 The work is frequently regarded as a key work in Baroque landscape painting and is the \\"most celebrated example\\" of the \\"new landscape style\\" Carracci developed in Rome of \\"carefully constructed landscape panoramas\\", according to Rudolf Wittkower.Wittkower, 70 For John Rupert Martin it is \\"the archetypal classical landscape, later to be emulated with variations by Domenichino, Poussin and Claude ... the small scale of the figures in relation to the spacious natural setting at once establishes a new priority in which landscape takes first place and history second\\";Martin, 60 though insofar as it is \\"new\\", that is for Italian painting, as such works had been common in Northern painting since Joachim Patinir began to use the same reversal of scale almost a century before. The journey of the Holy Family is echoed by other moving elements including the sheep, birds, cows and the camels on the ridge at left.Martin, 176 Wittkower sees in it \\"a heroic and aristocratic conception of Nature tamed and ennobled by the presence of man\\", as such works always contain a large man-made feature, here the castle \\"severely composed of horizontals and verticals\\" under which the party moves. They are placed at the meeting of two diagonals represented by the sheep and the river, \\"thus figures and buildings are intimately blended with the carefully arranged pattern of the landscape\\".Wittkower, 70 Kenneth Clark mentions the work as an example of the \\"ideal landscape\\" driven to promote itself in the hierarchy of genres by emulating (in the absence of much evidence of what classical landscape painting was like) an essentially literary vision, largely derived from the pastoral poems of Virgil: \\"the features of which it is composed must be chosen from nature, as poetic diction is chosen from ordinary speech, for their elegance, their ancient associations, and their faculty of harmonious combination. Ut pictura poesis\\".Clark, 67 Clark's praise of the work is noticeably faint, as it lacks the spirit he finds in Giorgione and Claude in the same tradition: \\"At their best, as in the lunettes in the Doria Gallery, Annibale Carracci's landscapes are admirable pieces of picture-making, in which agreeably stylized parts are built up into a harmonious whole. We recognize the science which has gone into the construction of the castle in the centre of the Flight into Egypt... But in the end these eclectic landscapes are of interest only to historians\\".Clark, 74; see the rest of the chapter for more whole-hearted praise of Giorgione and Claude.

Early history Baker's career as \\"Mr. Escape\\" began on February 22, 1967 when he presented an upside down hanging strait-jacket escape from the Tribune Tower Building in Oakland, California, United States. Thousands of people attended the escape along with actress Dawn Wells, and a sheriff who was a direct descendant of Wyatt Earp.Oakland Tribune, Feb.22,1967 The escape was documented by the British Pathe Newsreel Organization.Oakland Tribune Newspaper, Feb. 22, 1967 Edition, front page Steve Baker was a favorite on TV personality, Dick Clark. He performed numerous times on Dick Clark Live Wednesdays on NBC, then a few years later on another show called LIVE with Dick Clark on CBS.  Personal history  Steve Baker was born on July 26, 1938 in East St. Louis, Illinois. His parents were Joseph and Cleo (Spacklin) Baker. As a child, Baker had rheumatic fever, which restricted him to his room while his friends all played outside. The Baker family moved to California when he was eight years old to see a doctor specializing in rheumatic fever. In the years that Baker was confined in his room, he started reading ‚ÄúThe Art of Escape‚Äù about Harry Houdini and it inspired him. After three years, he recovered from the rheumatic fever and Baker challenged his friends to chain him up so he could practice what he learned from Houdini‚Äôs books. Baker enlisted in the U.S Air Force during the Cold War, but that did not stop him from practicing his escapes. He would perform periodically while not on duty to make extra money. When his time in the service ended, Baker went to Vietnam to perform for the troops. Over time, his courage and determination grew tremendously. This is where Baker knew he wanted to one-up Houdini. If Houdini was on the eighth floor, Baker would go to the ninth. After every escape, Baker‚Äôs confidence grew. Baker was able to travel the world doing what he loved. In 1971, at a show in Boise, Steve pulled an audience member on stage to assist in one of his tricks. This audience member was Julia Veltri, who then became his wife and stage assistant for the next 41 years. Together, Steve and Julia traveled to various countries performing magic tricks and escapes. In 2006, Steve and Julia moved to Irving, Illinois to care for Steve‚Äôs mother who was sick with cancer. Shortly after his mother died, Steve was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had a year‚Äôs worth of treatment. Steve never got back into his career following his prostate cancer. On September 17, 2017 at the age of 79, Steve Baker died in his home.

It is housed in the National Gallery, London, where it is given the title Christ appearing to Saint Peter on the Appian Way. The subject is a rare representation in art of the theme Quo vadis. Annibale Carracci was the founder of the Italian Baroque painting school, called Bolognese School. This painting is one of his best known works. Peter is depicted fleeing from Rome to avoid crucifixion and has a vision of meeting Christ bearing his Cross. Peter asks Jesus \\"Quo vadis?\\" to which he replies, \\"Romam vado iterum crucifigi\\". Peter returns to Rome after this vision. Painting The work depicts a scene featured in the apocryphal Acts of Peter. Saint Peter, while fleeing Rome along the ancient Via Appia, meets Christ outside the city, who is walking in the opposite direction towards the city, carrying his cross. Peter asks him, Domine, quo vadis? The question is in Latin and means \\"Lord, where are you going?\\" Jesus replies, Eo Romam iterum crucifigi, which means: \\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again.\\" The scene as catalogued in the apocryphal Acts of St. Peter, describes Peter who is fleeing Rome at the time of Emperor Nero's persecution. This encounter is reminiscent of Peter's denial, when Peter chose to deny Jesus three times during his passion and crucifixion. Apostle Peter realizes that he is on his way to making the same mistake all over again now, abandoning Jesus and his church in a moment of danger. Peter turns around when he understands that this was a sign, and returns to Rome to face the martyrdom. It was commissioned by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, and was kept in the Aldobrandini Collection recorded in 1603. The artwork blends two differing styles; both illustrating the typical Baroque approach to the subject. The colours were influenced by the Venetian School's rich colours, while the figures were monumental. This new style attempts to bring back the spirit of the classicism found in Michelangelo and Raphael's works, into Annibale's style; it came at a time Annibale entered an important new phase of creativity. Carracci used to draw also a lot after live models. In Domine, quo vadis? Carracci has portrayed Christ as a muscular athlete easily carrying the cross on his shoulder as he passes St Peter, with a dramatic gesture, bursting forth on the canvas. This new era took on a dramatic feel with a leaning towards intensifying movement and \\"figures [that] are rich in dignity\\". Peter originally had a straighter posture, but Annibale changed this in order to illustrate the emotional shock of Peter coming across Jesus. The paintings included references to classical antiquity, including architecture like temples and columns; the scale of the individuals was increased by bringing them into closer proximity to the surface giving the impression that they would emerge from the painting.

The series' style was influenced by the Art-Deco design of the period, and its engaging stories are suggested to be the main reason for its wide appeal among both adults and youth, and the subsequent success of the series. It is also considered the earliest French comic strip to employ speech bubbles, the device which was popularized by The Yellow Kid. After a long run of serial and album publications, Saint-Ogan ceased to produce the series in 1954. The series was later revived by Greg who, with the consent of Saint-Ogan, resumed production in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin. It was first published on 26 March 1963 and continued serial publication until 1969. Influences As a seminal comic strip in the bande dessin√©e culture, although appearing several years after Les Pieds Nickel√©s, Zig et Puce made an influential impact a few years before the debut of Herg√© and The Adventures of Tintin. The character of Alfred is also considered a pioneering central animal character, in the tradition of Franco-Belgian comics animals such as Milou (Snowy), Spip, Jocko, Jolly Jumper, Marsupilami and Id√©fix (Dogmatix). Alfred the auk was chosen as mascot by Charles Lindbergh when he landed in Paris on board the Spirit of St. Louis on the arrival of hist first transatlantic flight in May 1927. There, an American lady gave him a plush effigy of Alfred, which Lindergh took with him in his flight from Paris to Brussels. The character Alfred was chosen as the mascot of the 1974 Angoul√™me Comics Festival, and the name given to an award. The term Alfred was used until 1989 when it was renamed Alph'art (in honor of the last Adventures of Tintin comic Tintin and Alph-Art).

Completed in 1837, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971 for its exceptionally fine Greek Revival architecture. It currently serves as the lobby for the adjacent Actors Theatre of Louisville. Description and history The Old Bank of Louisville is located in downtown Louisville, on the south side of West Main Street between 3rd and 4th Streets. Occupying a relatively narrow lot, its facade consists of a pair of fluted stone columns topped by Ionic capitals and set in antis beneath an entablature and iron crested parapet. The flanking antae are, like the columns, fashioned from limestone, but with a battered finish. Behind the columns is a three-bay facade, with tall multipane windows flanking and rising above the center entrance. The interior retains some original finishes, notably including Ionic columns and a domed ceiling. The building was probably completed in 1837, for the Bank of Louisville, which had been chartered in 1832. It was probably designed by James Dakin, an architect who had worked with Minard Lafever, including the preparation of drawings for Lafever's The Beauties of Modern Architecture, published in 1835. Several of the building's features appear to be derived from plates found in that book. Gideon Shryock, who was long thought to be its designer, apparently served as its construction superintendent. After serving for many years as a bank, the building was converted in the 1970s to serve as a lobby space for the adjacent theater.

Research on the discovery and isolation of gustaducin is recent. It is known to play a large role in the transduction of bitter, sweet and umami stimuli. Its pathways (especially for detecting bitter stimuli) are many and diverse. An intriguing feature of gustducin is its similarity to transducin. These two G proteins have been shown to be structurally and functionally similar, leading researchers to believe that the sense of taste evolved in a similar fashion to the sense of sight. Gustducin is a heterotrimeric protein composed of the products of the GNAT3 (Œ±-subunit), GNB1 (Œ≤-subunit) and GNG13 (Œ≥-subunit).  Discovery  Gustducin was discovered in 1992 when degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and mixed with a taste tissue cDNA library. The DNA products were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method, and eight positive clones were shown to encode the Œ± subunits of G-proteins, (which interact with G-protein-coupled receptors). Of these eight, two had previously been shown to encode rod and cone Œ±-transducin. The eighth clone, Œ±-gustducin, was unique to the gustatory tissue.  Comparisons with transducin  Upon analyzing the amino-acid sequence of Œ±-gustducin, it was discovered that Œ±-gustducins and Œ±-transducins were closely related. This work showed that Œ±-gustducin's protein sequence gives it 80% identity to both rod and cone a-transducin. Despite the structural similarities, the two proteins have very different functionalities. However, the two proteins have similar mechanism and capabilities. Transducin removes the inhibition from cGMP Phosphodiesterase, which leads to the breakdown of cGMP. Similarly, Œ±-gustducin binds the inhibitory subunits of taste cell cAMP Phosphodiesterase which causes a decrease in cAMP levels. Also, the terminal 38 amino acids of Œ±-gustducin and Œ±-transducin are identical. This suggests that gustducin can interact with opsin and opsin-like G-coupled receptors. Conversely, this also suggests that transducin can interact with taste receptors. The structural similarities between gustducin and transducin are so great that comparison with transducin were used to propose a model of gustducin's role and functionality in taste transduction. Other G protein Œ±-subunits have been identified in TRCs (e.g. GŒ±i-2, GŒ±i-3, GŒ±14, GŒ±15, GŒ±q, GŒ±s) with function that has not yet been determined.  Location  While gustducin was known to be expressed in some taste receptor cells (TRCs), studies with rats showed that gustducin was also present in a limited subset of cells lining the stomach and intestine. These cells appear to share several feature of TRCs. Another study with humans brought to light two immunoreactive patterns for Œ±-gustducin in human circumavallate and foliate taste cells: plasmalemmal and cytosolic. These two studies showed that gustducin is distributed through gustatory tissue and some gastric and intestinal tissue and gustducin is presented in either in the cytoplasm or in apical membranes on TRC surfaces. Research showed that bitter-stimulated type 2 taste receptors (T2R/TRB) are only found in taste receptor cells positive for the expression of gustducin. Œ±-Gustducin is selectively expressed in ‚àº25‚Äì30% of TRCs  Evolution of the gustducin-mediated signaling model  Due to its structural similarity to transducin, gustducin was predicted to activate a phosphodiesterase (PDE). Phosphodieterases were found in taste tissues and their activation was tested in vitro with both gustducin and transducin. This experiment revealed transducin and gustducin were both expressed in taste tissue (1:25 ratio) and that both G proteins are capable of activating retinal PDE. Furthermore, when present with denatonium and quinine, both G proteins can activate taste specific PDEs. This indicated that both gustducin and transducin are important in the signal transduction of denatonium and quinine. The 1992 research also investigated the role of gustducin in bitter taste reception by using ‚Äúknock-out‚Äù mice lacking the gene for Œ±-gustducin. A taste test with knock-out and control mice revealed that the knock-out mice showed no preference between bitter and regular food in most cases. When the Œ±-gustducin gene was re-inserted into the knock-out mice, the original taste ability returned. However, the loss of the Œ±-gustducin gene did not completely remove the ability of the knock-out mice to taste bitter food, indicating that Œ±-gustducin is not the only mechanism for tasting bitter food. It was thought at the time that an alternative mechanism of bitter taste detection could be associated with the Œ≤Œ≥ subunit of gustducin. This theory was later validated when it was discovered that both peripheral and central gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one type of taste stimulant, although a neuron typically would favor one specific stimulant over others. This suggests that, while many neurons favor bitter taste stimuli, neurons that favor other stimuli such as sweet and umami may be capable of detecting bitter stimuli in the absence of bitter stimulant receptors, as with the knock-out mice.  Second messengers IP3 and cAMP Until recently, the nature of gustducin and its second messengers was unclear. It was clear, however, that gustducin transduced intracellular signals. Spielman was one of the first to look at the speed of taste reception, utilizing the quenched-flow technique. When the taste cells were exposed to the bitter stimulants denatonium and sucrose octaacetate, the intracellular response - a transient increase of IP3 \\\\- occurred within 50-100 millisecond of stimulation. This was not unexpected, as it was known that transducin was capable of sending signals within rod and cone cells at similar speeds. This indicated that IP3 was one of the second messengers used in bitter taste transduction. It was later discovered that cAMP also causes an influx of cations during bitter and some sweet taste transduction, leading to the conclusion that it also acted as a second messenger to gustducin.  Bitter transduction  When bitter- stimulated T2R/TRB receptors activate gustducin heterotrimers, gustducin acts to mediate two responses in taste receptor cells: a decrease in cAMPs triggered by Œ±-gustducin, and a rise in IP3(Inositol trisphosphate) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from Œ≤Œ≥-gustducin. Although the following steps of the Œ±-gustducin pathway are unconfirmed, it is suspected that decreased cAMPs may act on protein kinases which would regulate taste receptor cell ion channel activity. It is also possible that cNMP levels directly regulate the activity of cNMP-gated channels and cNMP-inhibited ion channels expressed in taste receptor cells. The Œ≤Œ≥-gustducin pathway continues with the activation of IP3 receptors and the release of Ca2+ followed by neurotransmitter release. Bitter taste transduction models Several models have been suggested for the mechanisms regarding the transduction of bitter taste signals. *Cell-surface receptors: Patch clamping experiments have shown evidence that bitter compounds such as denatonium and sucrose octaacetate act directly on specific cell-surface receptors. *Direct activation of G proteins: Certain bitter stimulants such as quinine have been show to activate G proteins directly. While these mechanisms have been identified, the physiologic relevance of the mechanism has not yet been established. *PDE activation: Other bitter compounds, such as thioacetamide and propylthiouracil, have been shown to have stimulatory effects on PDEs. This mechanism has been recognized in bovine tongue epithelium contains fungiform papillae. *PDE inhibition: Other bitter compounds have been shown to inhibit PDE. Bacitracin and hydrochloride have been show to inhibit PDE in bovine taste tissue *Channel blockage: Patch clamping experiments have shown that several bitter ions act directly on potassium channels, blocking them. This suggests that the potassium channels would be located in the apical region of the taste cells. While this theory seems valid, it has only been identified in mudpuppy taste cells. It is thought that these five diverse mechanisms have developed as defense mechanisms. This would imply that many different poisonous or harmful bitter agents exist and these five mechanisms exist to prevent humans from eating or drinking them. It is also possible that some mechanisms can act as backups should a primary mechanism fail. One example of this could be quinine, which has been shown to both inhibit and activate PDE in bovine taste tissue.  Sweet transduction  There are currently two models proposed for sweet taste transduction. The first pathway is a GPCRGs-cAMP pathway. This pathway starts with sucrose and other sugars activating Gs inside the cell through a membrane-bound GPCR. The activated Gas activates adenylyl cyclase to generate cAMP. From this point, one of two pathways can be taken. cAMP may act directly to cause an influx of cations through cAMP- gated channels or cAMP can activate protein kinase A, which causes the phosphorylation of K+ channels, thus closing the channels, allowing for depolarization of the taste cell, subsequent opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and causing neurotransmitter release . The second pathway is a GPCR-Gq/GŒ≤Œ≥-IP3 pathway which is used with artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners bind and activate GPCRs coupled to PLCŒ≤2 by either Œ±-Gq or GŒ≤Œ≥. The activated subunits activate PLCŒ≤2 to generate IP3 and DAG. IP3 and DAG elicit Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and cause cellular depolarization. An influx of Ca2+ triggers neurotransmitter release. While these two pathways coexist in the same TRCs, it is unclear how the receptors selectively mediate cAMP responses to sugars and IP3 responses to artificial sweeteners .  Evolution of bitter taste receptors  Of the five basic tastes, three (sweet, bitter and umami tastes) are mediated by receptors from the G protein-coupled receptor family. Mammalian bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are encoded by a gene family of only a few dozen members. It is believed that bitter taste receptors evolved as a mechanism to avoid ingesting poisonous and harmful substances. If this is the case, one might expect different species to develop different bitter taste receptors based on dietary and geographical constraints. With the exception of T2R1 (which lies on chromosome 5) all human bitter taste receptor genes can be found clustered on chromosome 7 and chromosome 12. Analyzing the relationships between bitter taste receptor genes show that the genes on the same chromosome are more closely related to each other than genes on different chromosomes. Furthermore, the genes on chromosome 12 have higher sequence similarity than the genes found on chromosome 7. This indicates that these genes evolved via tandem gene duplications and that chromosome 12, as a result of its higher sequence similarity between its genes, went through these tandem duplications more recently than the genes on chromosome 7.  Gustducin in the stomach  Recent work by Enrique Rozengurt has shed some light on the presence of gustducin in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. His work suggests that gustducin is present in these areas as a defense mechanism. It is widely known that some drugs and toxins can cause harm and even be lethal if ingested. It has already been theorized that multiple bitter taste reception pathways exist to prevent harmful substances from being ingested, but a person can choose to ignore the taste of a substance. Ronzegurt suggests that the presence of gustducin in epithelial cells in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract are indicative of another line of defense against ingested toxins. Whereas taste cells in the mouth are designed to compel a person to spit out a toxin, these stomach cells may act to force a person to spit up the toxins in the form of vomit.

Jack Leon Gordon was a highly publicized trial for a petition for a dissolution of marriage between American singer La Toya Jackson and her husband and manager Jack Gordon. On March 3, 1998, an order was entered by District Judge Carl J. Christensen at Clark County, Nevada, dissolving the marriage and awarding Jackson royalties, property, and a large sum of money.Gordon v. Gordon  Marriage history  Jackson and Gordon were married on September 5, 1989, in Reno, Nevada. According to Jackson's autobiography, the marriage was both unplanned and against her will. She later stated in an interview that Gordon tricked her into the marriage by brainwashing her into believing that her family was going to attempt to kidnap and kill her. What started as a business relationship soon turned into an abusive partnership; Gordon was arrested twice for second-degree assault against Jackson. Jackson also filed a gender-based lawsuit against Gordon before filing for divorce. Gordon repeatedly used Jackson for a quick profit. In 1996, Gordon attempted to force Jackson to dance at a Reading, Pennsylvania, strip club, Al's Diamond cabaret. She refused to do so and in return, was booed and heckled by the crowd, who paid to see her strip. (Reading Eagle (Reading, PA) Publish date:January 6, 2007). She refused and returned home to be beaten. It was at this point that Jackson left Gordon and immediately filed for divorce and a domestic violence injunction.  Gordon's violations of court orders  As a part of the original petition, it was requested that Gordon submit financial documents and all records of any property he owned. He exercised his right to not incriminate himself and refused to submit the documents to the court. His attorney admitted to this, and also admitted that Gordon had sold properties that he and Jackson mutually owned without Jackson's permission, despite the fact that the court had previously ordered that he not sell any of these properties until further instruction.Gordon v. Gordon, page 2, lines 5‚Äì9.  Return of Jackson's property  From the final divorce decree, Gordon was ordered to return all of Jackson's fur coats, photographs, videos, and furnishings. He was also ordered to forgo his rights to any of Jackson's contracts that she signed during the marriage, including those with Sony Music Entertainment, BMG Music, Playboy Entertainment, and Penguin/Dutton Books. Jackson was awarded full ownership of the Las Vegas apartment where the couple resided during their marriage.Gordon v. Gordon, pages 3‚Äì4.  Jackson's legal change of name  As part of the final judgment, Jackson's maiden name was restored; the document specifically states that her name was changed from La Toya Jackson-Gordon to La Toya Jackson, thus eliminating her former middle name of Yvonne as a part of her legal name.Gordon v. Gordon, page 2, lines 25‚Äì26.  Restraining order and final settlement  The judge also ordered that Gordon was strictly forbidden from utilizing the likeness of Jackson in any newspaper, magazine, tabloid, or promotional media, and that any violation of this order would result in severe sanctions.Gordon v. Gordon, page 6, lines 12‚Äì15 The order concludes with a response to Jackson's petition for a restraining order against Gordon; it was ordered by the court that Gordon and Jackson were both strictly prohibited from going within 100 feet of each other, each other's work place or residence, or any member of each other's family.Gordon v.

It is 10.53 km (6.60 mi) southwest of the traditional center of Dubai along Sheikh Zayed Road. The park is bordered by Sheikh Zayed Road, Al Wasl Road, Al Hadiqa Street, and 55th Street. There was some demolition here many years ago. https://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/dubai-water-canal-safa-park- partition-complete-2014-08-21-1.560296  History of Safa Park  Created in 1975, Safa Park was located on the outskirts of Dubai. Prior to its creation, the area was inhabited by illegal immigrants from South Asia. They lived in makeshift homes without running water. The Dubai government [Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum] turned its head from these illegal immigrants due to the need for their labor. The immigrants were later given amnesty and expelled from the immediate area for the creation of the park.  Development of Safa Park  After being a destination for Dubai's residents for nine years, the park went under redevelopment in 1984. Another redevelopment occurred between 1989 and 1992. The first redevelopment included the addition of sanitary utilities and an indoor playground. The latter development delivered recreational and service facilities to the park. Safa Park Redevelopment Dubai Municipality: Dubai Public Parks: Al Safa Park Today Safa Park is almost in the center of the city and only 3.05 km (1.90 mi) from the Burj Khalifa, 5.06 km (3.14 mi) from the Emirates Towers, and 6.27 km (3.90 mi) from the Dubai World Trade Centre. Due to Dubai's rapid growth, skyscrapers are now approaching the park's doorstep.  Flora and Fauna of Safa Park  The park contains three lakes, over 200 species of birds, and 16,924 different trees and bushes.Dubai Municipality: Dubai Public Parks: Al Safa Park: Recreation Within the park, is grass (which covers around 80% of the park), a small forest, and a hill.

The device integrated in the SOM typically requires a high level of interconnection for reasons such as speed, timing, bus-width etc., in a highly integrated module. There are benefits in building a SOM, as for SoC; one notable result is to reduce the cost of the base board or the main PCB. Two other major advantages of SOMs are design-reuse and that they can be integrated into many embedded computer applications.  History  The acronym SOM has its roots in the blade-based modules. In the mid 1980s, when VMEbus blades used mezzanine modules, these were commonly referred to as System On a Module (SOM). These SOMs performed specific functions such as compute functions and data acquisition functions. SOMs were and still are extensively used by Sun Microsystems, Motorola, Xerox, DEC, and IBM in their blade computers.  Design  A typical SOM consists of: * at least one microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor (DSP) core **multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) have more than one processor core * memory blocks including a selection of ROM, RAM, EEPROM and/or flash memory * timing sources * industry standard communication interfaces such as USB, FireWire, Ethernet, USART, SPI, I¬≤C * peripherals including counter-timers, real-time timers and power-on reset generators * analog interfaces including analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog converterss * voltage regulators and power management circuits  See also  * VPX * VXS * CompactPCI * Futurebus * PCI Mezzanine Card  References  * ANSI/IEEE Std 1014-1987 and ANSI/VITA 1-1994 * 1386-2001 - IEEE Standard for a Common Mezzanine Card Family: CMC * Standard ANSI/VITA 46.0-2007 * VITA Technologies Hall of Fame - PCI Mezzanine Cards Category:Microcomputers Category:Embedded systems Category:Computer buses Category:IEEE standards ","title":"System on module"},{"id":"11891513","text":"Location of Kazakhstan Kazakh wine is wine made in Kazakhstan. The roots of the Kazakh wine industry can be traced to the 7th century AD when grapevines were brought to the region from neighboring Uzbekistan and China. While only around 4% of the land in Kazakhstan is ideally situated for viticulture, the country does manage to produce over 6.2 million gallons (236,000 hl) of wine annually from .J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 380-381 Oxford University Press 2006 Buoyed by its mineral wealth, the country is an enthusiastic consumer of wine but must import 80% of the 30 m bottles it drinks. History An early Kazakh wine bottle. The earliest evidence of viticulture in Kazakhstan appear during the 7th century AD around Shymkent and in the foot hills of Tian Shan in Almaty Province near the Kazakh-Kyrgyzstan border. Vines were believed to have been introduced to the area by traders from the Xinjiang province of China and the Fergana and Samarqand regions of Uzbekistan. Throughout most of Kazakhstan's history, commercial winemaking was conducted on a small scale. In the early 20th century, state-run vineyards in Almaty, Shymkent and Taraz were the largest producers. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there has been renewed interest in the Kazakhstan wine industry with Russia becoming a leading trading partner in Kazakh wine. In general the emphasis will be on inexpensive table wine, although the UN thinks that the continental climate may allow the production of high-value ice wine. Climate and geography As an inland country, Kazakhstan has a very typical continental climate. Most of the region's vineyards are located in the southern half of the country near the borders of China, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan with a few smaller regions along the Caspian Sea in the west. Average annual rainfall varies throughout the country ranging from 4-6 inches (100‚Äì150 mm) in the wine regions around Atyrau and Aktobe to 27-39 inches (700‚Äì1000 mm) in the regions around the Talas River. Grape varieties Currently the Kazakhstan winemaking has largely focused on dessert wine production. More than 40 grape varieties are grown in the country though more than half are currently used for table grape production rather than winemaking. Popular wine grape varieties include Aligote, Aleatico, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Riesling, Rkatsiteli, Saperavi, Muscat Ottonel, Bayan Shirey, Kuljinski, Maiski Cherny and Rubinovy Magaracha. In general the grapes are the Georgian ones, such as Rkatsiteli and Saperavi, found in other parts of the former Soviet Union. More recently there has been interest in planting international varieties such as Sauvignon blanc. However local tastes would appear to prefer the traditional sweet red wines. Classification At present there is no appellation system in Kazakhstan. Wine regions About 80% of the country's wines are produced at the Issyk Winery in Issyk, some east of Almaty. Bought by the Swiss-based Consulting Group in 1996 and recently sold back to local company Dostar, it has gone under considerable changes with the help of Italian-based winery Marcato Vini and an Australian consultant. Major reconstruction has been undertaken, with the importation of \\"New World\\" technologies including sweeping arm fermenters, air bag presses, cross flow filtration and nitrogen production. It benefits from being 850 m up in the Tian Shan mountains of the southeast of the country. Other wineries include Bakhus and the Turgen Winery. There are 210 hectares of vineyards in the Zailiyskiy region of the Almaty Oblast. In Soviet times there were vineyards and wineries in the Sarkand and Alakol regions of Dzhungar Alatau, in the Almaty Oblast, but these were hit hard by the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Sinatra is one of the most influential music artists of the 20th century, and has sold 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all-time. Rock critic Robert Christgau called Sinatra \\"the greatest singer of the 20th century\\". In addition to his music career, Sinatra was also a successful film actor, having won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Private Angelo Maggio in From Here to Eternity (1953). Sinatra in 1955 Influences Sinatra's vocal style represented a strong departure from the \\"crooning\\" style of his idol, Bing Crosby. Sinatra's generation represented the first generation of children that had grown up in the era of the microphone, and the amplification of sound enabled singers to sing in a much softer, personal and nuanced style. However Sinatra, as he himself once noted, sang more, by which he meant that he introduced a bel canto sound to the tradition begun by Crosby. And, more importantly, he might be said to have brought the Crosby tradition to artistic completion, taking it to levels of intensity and depth of feeling that, because of the displacement of the Crosby ‚Äì Sinatra tradition by rock and roll and subsequent genres, are unlikely to be achieved again. Two other great performers of the 1930s and 1940s were significant influences on Sinatra: Billie Holiday and Mabel Mercer. Sinatra regularly heard \\"Lady Day\\" in New York clubs in the 1940s and learned from her the importance of authenticity of emotion. From Mercer he learned the importance of the element of \\"story\\" in a song. For Sinatra a song is a three- to four-minute narrative ‚Äî sometimes even the story of himself, his own life, his own heartaches, his own feelings of buoyancy ‚Äî and this is why Ella Fitzgerald could say of him, \\"With Frank, it's always this little guy, telling this ... story.\\" The archetypal examples of the Sinatra song as story could later be found in two selections from his 1958 Capitol album, Frank Sinatra Sings For Only The Lonely: \\"Angel Eyes\\" and \\"One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)\\". Sinatra's voice Sinatra with Eileen Barton in 1945 Sinatra made a point of studying Tommy Dorsey's trombone playing as a means of cultivating a more free-flowing vocal style ‚Äî he noticed that Dorsey used a small airhole at the side of his mouth to sneak breaths when playing. Sinatra would employ a similar technique, and so be able to hold notes for incredibly long durations. In addition to this, Sinatra started to jog and swim underwater to develop his lung capacity ‚Äî which enabled him to continue a musical phrase through a stanza without pausing, or breaking the note, for breath. Sinatra's legato-style of singing/phrasing took pop singing in new directions when most singers of the 1940s were keen to emulate Bing Crosby. As happens with many singers, Sinatra suffered at least one period of major vocal difficulty, which he remedied with the help of Metropolitan Opera baritone Robert Merrill. As a song-stylist, Sinatra's jazz-infused approach to singing seemed to occur with the end of the \\"Big Band\\" era and ushering in of an era that favored the vocalist and made him/her the focus, not the bandleader and his band. Sinatra at Liederkranz Hall in New York City in ca. 1947 According to music critic Henry Pleasants \\"The voice itself was a typical Italian light baritone with a two octave range from G to G, declining, as it darkened in later years, to F to F and with greater potential at the top than he was commonly disposed to exploit. He could and sometimes did depress the larynx and 'cover' as classical singers do, to sustain a full rounded tone in moving up the scale. On his recording 'Day by Day,' for example he gives out with full-voiced, admirably focused D's and E's and even lands a briefly held but confident high G just before the end.\\" Pleasants, H. (1974). The Great American Popular Singers. Simon and Schuster His early recordings found him singing in near-tenor range, hitting a high F on \\"All or Nothing At All\\" (1939) or \\"Where's My Bess\\" (1946), whilst being equally adept in the lower register, the low E on his 1962 recording of \\"Ol' Man River\\" being a prime example of such. His phrasing was also impeccable, getting to the heart of a song by emphasizing words and lines in ways that made a song more personal, whilst his ability to hold notes, sing above or behind the beat and rest on a note were hallmarks of a singer fully in command of his instrument. Sinatra as a conductor Sinatra in 1962 Between 1946 and 1983, Sinatra conducted seven albums and occasionally conducted live orchestras on stage. His first recordings on which he wielded the baton were instigated by producer Mitch Miller, who approached Columbia boss Maine Sachs to request that Sinatra conduct some of the work of Alec Wilder, later released as Frank Sinatra Conducts The Music Of Alec Wilder. In 1956, Sinatra recorded the first album in the Capitol Records tower, not as a vocalist, but as a conductor on the album Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color. In 1957 and 1959, he conducted albums for Peggy Lee ‚Äî The Man I Love ‚Äî and Dean Martin ‚Äî Sleep Warm ‚Äî the latter, charting inside Billboard's Top 40. A lesser-known project for his own label, Reprise, entitled Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays remains relatively obscure, and it was 20 years before Sinatra conducted in a studio again, for Sylvia Syms on the album Syms by Sinatra, which featured the final arrangements of Don Costa. The following year Sinatra conducted for trumpeter Charles Turner on the album What's New?. Genres Billboard ad in 1945 Sinatra would certainly have been considered a 'pop' singer before the rock and roll era, and the epithets 'traditional pop\\" or more specifically \\"classic pop\\" have perhaps been coined to describe Sinatra's style. In addition, Sinatra would and did tackle several styles and genres of music throughout his career, with differing degrees of success. There still exists a debate as to whether Sinatra was a jazz singer. He certainly performed with many of the finest jazz musicians and, in fact, headlined the Newport Jazz Festival and toured with the Red Norvo Quintet. There are very few occasions when Sinatra was recorded scat singing, but minor nuances and slight deviations from the vocal line are a hallmark of the material he recorded, and he was also known for his impeccable jazz timing and phrasing. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine the Sinatra after 1953 without the influence of jazz. It is no accident that he would be Lester Young's ideal singer in the band Young had hoped to lead, nor that Miles Davis identified Sinatra's phrasing as an influence on his own. The list of Sinatra's jazz admirers is long and stellar, including such figures as Count Basie, Stan Getz, Oscar Peterson and Jaco Pastorius. The Philadelphia radio DJ Sid Mark has hosted a Frank Sinatra show (Friday with Frank, Saturday with Sinatra, Sunday with Sinatra) since 1957. Songs and albums Sinatra at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1965 Sinatra left a vast legacy of recordings, from his very first sides with the Harry James orchestra in 1939, the vast catalogs at Columbia in the 1940s, Capitol in the 1950s, and Reprise from the 1960s onwards, up to his 1994 album Duets II. Some of his best known recorded songs include: * Great American Songbook entries such as \\"Night and Day\\", \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", and \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\" * Comic numbers such as \\"Love and Marriage\\" (used as the theme for American television comedy Married... with Children) * Torch songs such as \\"One for My Baby\\", \\"Angel Eyes\\", and \\"Drinking Again\\" * \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" and \\"Summer Wind\\", which capture his mid-1960s persona of sentimental nostalgia * \\"That's Life\\", \\"My Way\\", and \\"New York, New York\\", which convey his late-stage attitude of bombastic defiance. Three of his songs made #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 after the advent of the rock and roll era: \\"Learnin' the Blues\\" (1955), \\"Strangers in the Night\\" (1966), and \\"Somethin' Stupid\\" (1967), the last a duet with daughter Nancy. Of all his many albums, Sinatra at the Sands, recorded live in Las Vegas in 1966, with Sinatra in his prime, backed by Count Basie's big band, remains his most popular and is still a big seller. Whether in nightclubs, casinos, arenas, or stadiums, Sinatra was one of the most mesmeric entertainers of the twentieth century, capable of turning the largest venue into a simulacrum of an intimate club. There are, however, few recordings or videos of his concerts. In addition to the Sands performance with Basie, three performances of Sinatra at the very peak of his career were captured: With Red Norvo Quintet: Live In Australia, 1959, Sinatra '57 in Concert, a performance in Seattle with an orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle and Sinatra & Sextet: Live in Paris, recorded in June 1962. Sinatra is also credited with putting out perhaps the first concept album. 1955's In the Wee Small Hours is the prime example: a set of songs specifically recorded for the album, using only ballads, organized around a central mood of late-night isolation and aching lost love (supposedly due to his separation from Ava Gardner), with a now-classic album cover reflecting the theme. Rolling Stone magazine later named In the Wee Small Hours as #100 on its list of the 500 best albums of all time, an impressive showing given that its rankings reflect the outlook of the rock generation. The following year's Songs For Swingin' Lovers took an alternate tack, recording existing pop standards in a hipper, jazzier fashion, revealing an overall exuberance; Rolling Stone placed it #306 on the above list. It was the advent of the long-playing record that opened the door to these famous concept albums of the 1950s, but Sinatra's first efforts in this direction go back to the Columbia years and The Voice, when the 78 rpm disc made \\"album\\" less of a metaphor than it would become with the single-disc LPs of the 1950s. The Voice of Frank Sinatra was released on March 4, 1946 ‚Äî it was re-issued as a 10\\" record in 1958. Four more albums would follow over the next five years, as would a Christmas album and a project in which Sinatra conducted the songs of Alec Wilder. Other notable Sinatra albums include Where Are You? from 1957, which was his first stereo album and his first album recorded with Gordon Jenkins, Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely (1958), a bleak, introspective album, which Sinatra later claimed was his finest work. The lavish The Concert Sinatra (1963) offered re-recordings of \\"Ol' Man River\\" and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\", backed by a 73-piece orchestra. 1965's September of My Years, according to critic Stephen Holden \\"summed up the punchy sentimentality of a whole generation of American men\\". Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) was a late foray into bossa nova, with Antonio Carlos Jobim. 1973's comeback album Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back was Sinatra's first album after being away from recording for three years; 1980's Trilogy: Past Present Future was an ambitious triple album using three arrangers that attempted to portray the past, present, and future of his career. 1981's She Shot Me Down is sometimes considered the last great Sinatra album. A collection of what Sinatra called \\"saloon songs\\", it includes Alec Wilder's \\"A Long Night\\". Speaking to Robin Douglas-Home in 1961, Sinatra said, with regards to the making of his many concept albums, \\"First I pick the mood for an album, and perhaps pick a title. Or perhaps it might be that I had that title and then picked the mood to fit it... Then I get a shortlist of maybe sixty possible songs and out of these I pick twelve to record. Next comes the pacing of the album, which is vitally important... Once we choose songs that will be in a particular album, I'll sit with Bill Miller, my pianist, and find the proper key. Then I will meet with the orchestrator... Usually we wind up doing it the way the arranger feels it should be done, because he understands more than I do about it...\\" Sinatra's star for music on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Charts and hits Frank Sinatra holds the unique distinction of singing on the first Billboard #1 single, \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" (1940) ‚Äî which sold 900,000 copies ‚Äî and had the first ever #1 album in the UK, Songs For Swingin' Lovers (July 28, 1956). This same album is also the only album to chart among the UK top twenty singles, peaking at #12 on June 15, 1956. In 1959, the album Come Dance with Me! also entered the UK singles chart peaking at #30 the same week it would start a 30-week run on the album chart, going as high as #2. From his first released single in 1940 ‚Äî as the singer with Tommy Dorsey's band ‚Äî to the 1980 release of \\"Theme from New York, New York\\", Frank Sinatra had 209 hits on Billboard's pop singles charts. Of those, 127 made the Top Twenty, 70 made the Top Ten and 10 reached the #1 position ‚Äî \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" (1940), \\"There Are Such Things\\" (1942), \\"In the Blue of the Evening\\" (1943), \\"All or Nothing at All\\" (1944), \\"Oh What It Seemed To Be\\" (1945), \\"Five Minutes More\\" (1946), \\"Mam'selle\\" (1947), \\"Learning the Blues\\" (1955), \\"Strangers in the Night\\" (1966) and \\"Somethin' Stupid\\" (1967). Of Sinatra's 56 Top Twenty albums on Billboard's pop album charts, 42‚Äîincluding soundtracks ‚Äî reached the Top Ten and 6 made the #1 position ‚Äî The Voice of Frank Sinatra (1946), Come Fly With Me (1958), Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely (1958), Come Dance with Me! (1959), Nice 'n' Easy (1960) and Strangers in the Night (1966). He also has the longest time span of charting Top Ten albums on the Billboard album chart, 62 years with The Voice of Frank Sinatra going to #1 in 1946, and Nothing But the Best going to #2 in 2008. Sinatra's 1958 album Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely spent 120 weeks on Billboard's album chart, peaking at #1. His next album, Come Dance with Me! (1959) spent 140 weeks on Billboard, peaking at #2. \\"My Way\\" (1969) is the longest charting U.K. single of all time, with 122 weeks spent on the chart, peaking at number 5. The single re-entered the chart 8 times between 1970 and 1972. A 1995 re- release spent 2 weeks on the chart. In the UK, 42 Sinatra albums have made the Top Ten. Fifty-four Sinatra albums have made the Top Twenty, the longest charting of those albums being the 1997 compilation My Way: The Very Best of Frank Sinatra, which, to date, has charted for 128 weeks achieving 5 x platinum status. Six of Sinatra's albums reached the #1 position on the UK album chart, with a further five peaking at #2.

This species grows to a length of TL. This species is farmed.  Aquarium care  Unlike its close relative the Parachromis managuensis, commonly known and traded as the jaguar cichlid, the motaguensis isn't as commonly encountered in the aquarium trade. Although their visual appearance is very similar, The motaguensis (traded by many names, including Red tiger, Red dragon cichlid) displays an array of bright red dots,(hence the variants of the common name),which run along the flanks to the base of the caudal fin. An impressive array of this colouration is made distinct on the gills of this fish where such colour is highly pronounced. The female of this species is even more brilliantly coloured, with a deep shades of red and oranges much more prominent than the males colour. This colour is enhanced further during the breeding period. =Breeding= Breeding can be achieved with very little effort and no specific requirements are needed for breeding purposes. As long as water conditions are maintained at a desirable high quality, a breeding pair of such fish will readily spawn. To enhance the likelihood of acquiring a breeding pair, purchase several healthy and active juveniles at a young age (between 6 -10) and grow these specimens until sexual maturity. Generally, you should be left with a breeding pair or two. These fish will noticeably become more aggressive and territorial, Remove all other fish at this point and keep the newly formed breeding pair separate. When a breeding pair had been successfully established,The male will begin to court the female by displaying his erect finnage to the female as he tries to impress her in an attempt for her to accept his mating invitation. The pair will begin to clean a flat surface if the female is responsive of the male's previous courting behavior. The female will then lay approximately 1000 - 2000 orange coloured eggs which will then be fertilized by the male. The eggs will be ferociously guarded by both parents and a high degree of parental care is show to the eggs and fry. When the eggs 'hatch' after approximately 5 ‚Äì7 days, the offspring (known as wrigglers at this stage in development) are defenseless and are unable to swim. They are often transported to pre dug pits by both parents, and are guarded. The fry will begin to swim in approximately 7 days and should be fed with baby brine shrimp or alike. If you would like to rear these fry, they should be removed at this point as they will later be consumed by both parents as the female becomes due to spawn once more. Feed the fry baby brine shrimp until the stage where they are large enough to consume blood worm, daphnia and other live foods. When purchasing fish in an attempt to acquire a breeding pair, try to buy fish from different sources. There is a high probability that when buying fish from the same source, Fish will be from the same parents (Siblings). This should be avoided, as breeding fish in this manner may form offspring with genetic disease usually associated with interbreeding. Also, buy fish of a similar size, the chances of acquiring a breeding pair with fish of a similar size is significant to that of attempting to breed fish of different age and size. =Aquarium= The aquarium should be large (400l +) for a breeding pair of red tiger cichlids. As with all members of its genus, These fish are large and heavily built cichlids who are aggressive and highly territorial. Decor should be kept to a minimum in such n aquarium and a sand or fine gravel should be used as the main substrate. Many pieces of flat slate or rock should also be included for the female to lay her eggs upon. =Diet= The Parachromis are not fussy eaters and will readily accept most food substances offered. Diet should be varied however. Offer a variety of insect, including blood worm, earthworm, mysis, crickets (for larger specimens).Chopped meat can also be offered along with beef heart (offer vary sparingly due to its high fat content) along with prawn and fish (live/frozen). Frozen fish is a much preferred method of feeding fish as many \\"feeder fish\\" carry the risk of the introducing disease into an aquarium. =Sexing= Females are smaller than the male and the red pigment seems more prominent in the gill plates. The red colouration is significantly prominent in the female in breeding colours. The male's dorsal and ventral fins are also much more extended and elongated than the female's. =Water chemistry= pH of 7.0 - 8.0 preferably.

When the insurance agent opens the son's door he finds the boy hanging from a noose, dead from an apparent suicide. The father then shows up at Joon-oh's office and asks for the money pertaining to his son's life insurance policy. Joon-oh is suspicious of the man and tells him he has to wait until the coroner's report comes in. The man becomes furious and then leaves.

Because of Mansfield's fast population growth, MISD administrators purchased the historic location to build the district's fourth high school. After clearing land and deciding on blueprints, newly hired principal, David Wright, formed a committee to create the school's name and mascot. Legacy fit perfectly. Broncos fit even better. In June 2006, committee members chose red and black as the colors. Legacy High School was turned over to MISD in June 2007 by the builder and school started, with over 2,100 students, on August 27, 2007.

Deciding they needed a more prominent front man, they added lead vocalist Charlie Ware within their first year. Other original band members included Tony Sanfilippo, guitar; Rob Brown, bass; and Scott \\"Scoots\\" Bauer, drums. With the band‚Äôs powerful rock sound and Ware‚Äôs spastic dancing, the band became a huge local draw. The band signed to Relativity Records and released \\"Jaundice\\" in 1994. The band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada in support of the record. The song \\"Treasure Hands\\" received extensive airplay, especially in Southern California. Internal struggles within the band led to drummer Bauer leaving, replaced by Scott Clark. But the band members felt their record company never fully supported them, and friction between the band and its management with Relativity led to the band breaking up briefly, in order to get out of their contract. In 1998, the band reunited and recorded a new CD \\"How to Survive an Air Crash\\" on SRH Records. Santos left the band and Lucy's Fur Coat continued as a four-piece and soldiered on, mostly playing at local clubs. Though the band generated some major label interest, they failed to get signed and again the group broke up. Lucy's Fur Coat has reunited several times over the years for one-off shows, some of which have included Santos. Ware and Sanfilippo formed the band Pumphouse with Petey X of Rocket from the Crypt. Santos and Brown joined Marc Balanky (Funeral March, The Palominos), Tom Perry (Deadbolt) and Joe Camacho (Malachi Crunch) to form the country band The Scramblers. Santos later formed the group The Coolest Band in America in 2004, which released CDs \\"Air Conditioned\\" and \\"Memo.\\" Currently, Ware, Santos, Petey X, Morgan Smith (the Front) and Mark Magard (Louis XIV and Convoy) formed the band Midnight Rivals and are gigging in the San Diego area. Santos also fronts \\"Bayside Bridge Club\\" a retro first-wave group with Charlie Brownell, Jeff Trag, D Segel, and Danno. In 2016, Santos joined Balanky, Perry and Mark Sgarbossa to form Sea Base.

In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended babies sleep on their backs to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although the rate of SIDS decreased by 50% since the Safe to Sleep campaign started in 1994, an unintended consequence was that babies missed out on the twelve or so hours they used to spend in the prone position while asleep, and there was a sharp increase in plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) in infants. Along with tummy time, rotating the direction infants lie in their cribs as well as avoiding too much time in car seats, carriers, and bouncers are behaviors recommended to alleviate the associated risks of infants sleeping in a supine position. Impact on development Infants put to sleep in the supine position have been found to reach motor developmental milestones (e.g. crawling, rolling, and sitting) at a slower rate compared to infants who sleep in the prone position. When babies experience tummy time in their waking hours, they are provided with opportunities to strengthen their neck and trunk muscles positioning the infant on their stomach while awake will not impact the amount of slow wave sleep since tummy time only occurs when an infant is awake. Furthermore, tummy time provides infants with opportunities for cognitive and communicative development through interactive play with their supervisor.  Implementation  Tummy time is recommended to be practiced from birth, first in short sessions of three to five minutes, two to three times a day. As babies grow more receptive towards the sessions, they can be extended and performed more frequently. The World Health Organisation advises that infants under one year of age who are not yet mobile should experience tummy time for at least 30 minutes per day across sessions. Supervision by a parent or caregiver is important during tummy time so that the infant's position can be monitored and to encourage social interaction. Babies who are unaccustomed to frequent tummy time sessions may cry or show noncompliance when it is first introduced, however enjoyment may be increased by providing stimulating objects during sessions, such as preferred toys and videos. Tummy time may also be used to stabilize the neck in torticollis, and to address hypertonia associated with Down syndrome. Although sleeping in the supine position without sufficient tummy time may change the physical appearance of the head through plagiocephaly and consequently promote developmental delays, regardless of these effects, it is essential that infants are placed to sleep on their back due to the risk of SIDS.

GsŒ± is a GTPase that functions as a cellular signaling protein. GsŒ± is the founding member of one of the four families of heterotrimeric G proteins, defined by the alpha subunits they contain: the GŒ±s family, GŒ±i/GŒ±o family, GŒ±q family, and GŒ±12/GŒ±13 family. The Gs-family has only two members: the other member is Golf, named for its predominant expression in the olfactory system. In humans, GsŒ± is encoded by the GNAS complex locus, while GolfŒ± is encoded by the GNAL gene. Function The general function of Gs is to activate intracellular signaling pathways in response to activation of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs function as part of a three-component system of receptor-transducer-effector. The transducer in this system is a heterotrimeric G protein, composed of three subunits: a GŒ± protein such as GsŒ±, and a complex of two tightly linked proteins called GŒ≤ and GŒ≥ in a GŒ≤Œ≥ complex. When not stimulated by a receptor, GŒ± is bound to GDP and to GŒ≤Œ≥ to form the inactive G protein trimer. When the receptor binds an activating ligand outside the cell (such as a hormone or neurotransmitter), the activated receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to promote GDP release from and GTP binding to GŒ±, which drives dissociation of GTP-bound GŒ± from GŒ≤Œ≥. In particular, GTP-bound, activated GsŒ± binds to adenylyl cyclase to produce the second messenger cAMP, which in turn activates the cAMP- dependent protein kinase (also called Protein Kinase A or PKA). Cellular effects of GsŒ± acting through PKA are described here. Although each GTP-bound GsŒ± can activate only one adenylyl cyclase enzyme, amplification of the signal occurs because one receptor can activate multiple copies of Gs while that receptor remains bound to its activating agonist, and each GsŒ±-bound adenylyl cyclase enzyme can generate substantial cAMP to activate many copies of PKA. Receptors The G protein-coupled receptors that couple to the Gs family proteins include: * 5-HT receptors types 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 * ACTH receptor a.k.a.

This visually shows that the buffer has no real end and it can loop around the buffer. However, since memory is never physically created as a ring, a linear representation is generally used as is done below. In computer science, a circular buffer, circular queue, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.  Overview  A 24-byte keyboard circular buffer. When the write pointer is about to reach the read pointer - because the microprocessor is not responding, the buffer will stop recording keystrokes and - in some computers - a beep will be played. A circular buffer first starts out empty and has a set length. In the diagram below is a 7-element buffer: :250px Assume that 1 is written in the center of a Circular Buffer (the exact starting location is not important in a Circular Buffer: :250px Then assume that two more elements are added to the Circular Buffer -- 2 & 3 -- which get put after 1: :250px If two elements are removed, the two oldest values inside of the Circular Buffer would be removed. Circular Buffers use FIFO (First In, First Out) logic. In the example 1 & 2 were the first to enter the Circular Buffer, they are the first to be removed, leaving 3 inside of the Buffer. :250px If the buffer has 7 elements, then it is completely full: :250px A property of the circular buffer is that when it is full and a subsequent write is performed, then it starts overwriting the oldest data. In the current example, two more elements -- A & B -- are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4: :250px Alternatively, the routines that manage the buffer could prevent overwriting the data and return an error or raise an exception. Whether or not data is overwritten is up to the semantics of the buffer routines or the application using the circular buffer. Finally, if two elements are now removed then what would be returned is not 3 & 4 but 5 & 6 because A & B overwrote the 3 & the 4 yielding the buffer with: :250px : Uses The useful property of a circular buffer is that it does not need to have its elements shuffled around when one is consumed. (If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.) In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO (Last In, First Out) buffer. Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Should a maximum size be adopted for a queue, then a circular buffer is a completely ideal implementation; all queue operations are constant time. However, expanding a circular buffer requires shifting memory, which is comparatively costly. For arbitrarily expanding queues, a linked list approach may be preferred instead. In some situations, overwriting circular buffer can be used, e.g. in multimedia. If the buffer is used as the bounded buffer in the producer-consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e.g., an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e.g., the sound card) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates on the assumption that strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer. : Circular buffer mechanics A circular buffer can be implemented using four pointers, or two pointers and two integers: * buffer start in memory * buffer end in memory, or buffer capacity * start of valid data (index or pointer) * end of valid data (index or pointer), or amount of data currently in the buffer (integer) This image shows a partially full buffer: :250px This image shows a full buffer with four elements (numbers 1 through 4) having been overwritten: :250px When an element is overwritten, the start pointer is incremented to the next element. In utilizing full buffer capacity with pointer-based implementation strategy, the buffer's full or empty state could not be resolved directly from checking the positions of the start and end indexes. Therefore, an additional mechanism must be implemented for checking this. One common way to deal with this, when using 2 pointers, is to only allow the buffer to hold (size ‚àí 1) items. When both pointers are equal, the buffer is empty, and when the end pointer is one less than the start pointer, the buffer is full. When the buffer is instead designed to track the number of inserted elements , checking for emptiness means checking and checking for fullness means checking whether equals the capacity. Incrementing and decrementing the circular buffer address pointers is accomplished in software using the following modulus formulas: increment_address_one = (address + 1) % Length decrement_address_one = (address + Length - 1) % Length In languages whose modulo operator apply truncated division, the extra Length addition for the decrement by one operation is required to prevent negative results and to ensure proper rollover the end address of the circular buffer.  Optimization  A circular-buffer implementation may be optimized by mapping the underlying buffer to two contiguous regions of virtual memory. (Naturally, the underlying buffer‚Äòs length must then equal some multiple of the system‚Äôs page size.) Reading from and writing to the circular buffer may then be carried out with greater efficiency by means of direct memory access; those accesses which fall beyond the end of the first virtual-memory region will automatically wrap around to the beginning of the underlying buffer. When the read offset is advanced into the second virtual-memory region, both offsets‚Äîread and write‚Äîare decremented by the length of the underlying buffer.  Fixed-length- element and contiguous-block circular buffer  Perhaps the most common version of the circular buffer uses 8-bit bytes as elements. Some implementations of the circular buffer use fixed-length elements that are bigger than 8-bit bytes‚Äî16-bit integers for audio buffers, 53-byte ATM cells for telecom buffers, etc. Each item is contiguous and has the correct data alignment, so software reading and writing these values can be faster than software that handles non-contiguous and non-aligned values. Ping-pong buffering can be considered a very specialized circular buffer with exactly two large fixed-length elements. The Bip Buffer (bipartite buffer) is very similar to a circular buffer, except it always returns contiguous blocks which can be variable length. This offers nearly all the efficiency advantages of a circular buffer while maintaining the ability for the buffer to be used in APIs that only accept contiguous blocks.Simon Cooke (2003), \\"The Bip Buffer - The Circular Buffer with a Twist\\" Fixed-sized compressed circular buffers use an alternative indexing strategy based on elementary number theory to maintain a fixed-sized compressed representation of the entire data sequence.

This family is also commonly called the Gq/11 (Gq/G11) family or Gq/11/14/15 family to include closely related family members. G alpha subunits may be referred to as Gq alpha, GŒ±q, or GqŒ±. Gq proteins couple to G protein- coupled receptors to activate beta-type phospholipase C (PLC-Œ≤) enzymes. PLC-Œ≤ in turn hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 acts as a second messenger to release stored calcium into the cytoplasm, while DAG acts as a second messenger that activates protein kinase C (PKC).  Family members  In humans, there are four distinct proteins in the Gq alpha subunit family: * GqŒ± is encoded by the gene GNAQ. * G11Œ± is encoded by the gene GNA11. * G14Œ± is encoded by the gene GNA14. * G15Œ± is encoded by the gene GNA15.  Function  The general function of Gq is to activate intracellular signaling pathways in response to activation of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs function as part of a three-component system of receptor-transducer- effector. The transducer in this system is a heterotrimeric G protein, composed of three subunits: a GŒ± protein such as GqŒ±, and a complex of two tightly linked proteins called GŒ≤ and GŒ≥ in a GŒ≤Œ≥ complex. When not stimulated by a receptor, GŒ± is bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and to GŒ≤Œ≥ to form the inactive G protein trimer. When the receptor binds an activating ligand outside the cell (such as a hormone or neurotransmitter), the activated receptor acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to promote GDP release from and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding to GŒ±, which drives dissociation of GTP-bound GŒ± from GŒ≤Œ≥. Recent evidence suggests that GŒ≤Œ≥ and GŒ±q-GTP could maintain partial interaction via the N-Œ±-helix region of GŒ±q. GTP-bound GŒ± and GŒ≤Œ≥ are then freed to activate their respective downstream signaling enzymes. Gq/11/14/15 proteins all activate beta-type phospholipase C (PLC-Œ≤) to signal through calcium and PKC signaling pathways. PLC-Œ≤ then cleaves a specific plasma membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG remains bound to the membrane, and IP3 is released as a soluble molecule into the cytoplasm. IP3 diffuses to bind to IP3 receptors, a specialized calcium channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These channels are specific to calcium and only allow the passage of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm. Since cells actively sequester calcium in the ER to keep cytoplasmic levels low, this release causes the cytosolic concentration of calcium to increase, causing a cascade of intracellular changes and activity through calcium binding proteins and calcium-sensitive processes. : Further reading: Calcium function in vertebrates DAG works together with released calcium to activate specific isoforms of PKC, which are activated to phosphorylate other molecules, leading to further altered cellular activity. : Further reading: function of protein kinase C The GŒ±q / GŒ±11 (Q209L) mutation is associated with the development of uveal melanoma and its pharmacological inhibition (cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 inhibitor), decreases tumor growth in preclinical trials.

There is a collection of rare old maps of the area available for scholarly research. Description and history The Redington House stands on the southeast side of Silver Street (Maine State Route 137) in central Waterville, between Western Avenue and Silver Place. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior brick chimneys, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. The front facade is five bays wide, with the outer bays closely spaced but offset from the center. The entrance, at the center, is sheltered by a single-story porch which extends across the center three bays, and is supported by fluted Ionic columns with an ornate wooden railing above. Most of the windows are sash, but that above the entrance is flanked by sidelights. The interior retains original period finishes. Extending to the rear of the main block are later wood frame additions. with The museum is housed in a two story home built in 1814 by pioneer Waterville settler Asa Redington, a veteran of three enlistments in the American Revolutionary War and a member of George Washington's elite Honor Guard. After the victory against the English, he developed the water rights at Ticonic Falls Waterville Main Street and with his sons, Samuel and William, established a thriving flour mill on the banks of the Kennebec River. The father of six sons and three daughters, Asa built this substantial home for his son William. Fashioned of great hewn timbers, all hand pegged, it still features the original spiral staircase, fireplaces with period woodwork, and floors of wide pumpkin pine. The newel post in the entrance exhibits the \\"contractor's peace stone,\\" a small smooth polished stone signifying in Colonial times that the project had been completed to both the owner's and builder's satisfaction. Today, five rooms are furnished with antiques of the late 18th and early 19th centuries from the Redington family, the family of pioneer attorney Timothy Boutelle, the family of revolutionary war veteran Jabez Mathews, and from other early local families.

They spoke a Muskogean language related to Hitchiti. They lived along the Apalachicola River in present-day Florida. Their name derives probably from Hitchiti Apalachicoli or Muskogee Apalachicolo, signifying apparently \\"People of the other side\\", with reference probably to the Apalachicola River or some nearby stream.  History  Around 1706, some Apalachicola moved from the Apalachicola River area to the Savannah River, which formed the future border between the colony of South Carolina and Georgia. They may have been captured during English-sponsored slave raids and forced to relocate to the Savannah River area. A census taken in 1708 described the Apalachicola of the Savannah River as the \\"Naleathuckles\\", with 80 men settled in a town about 20 miles up the Savannah River. A more accurate census was taken by John Barnwell in early 1715. It described the Savannah River Apalachicola as living in two villages and having a population of 214 people: 64 men, 71 women, 42 boys, and 37 girls. In the Yamasee War of 1715, the Apalachicola joined in the Native American attacks on South Carolina. Afterward, the survivors returned to the Apalachicola River, forming near the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers. Some later moved north to live along the Chattahoochee River in present-day Russell County, Alabama. Following Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, the United States pressured the Apalachicola to sign two treaties, in 1833 and 1834, to cede their lands in the Southeast in exchange for land west of the Mississippi River. In 1836-1840, the Apalachicola moved to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They merged there with other Creek peoples and descendants are enrolled in the federally recognized Muscogee (Creek) Nation.

The two NYU graduates decided that Colorado needed a small- batch vodka, similar to the micro-brewed beers popular in the state. As a result, Matthew and his father Mitch started Altitude Spirits and began producing Vodka 14. The Vodka is currently available throughout Colorado and online.

Lustration, \\"cleansing\\", derives from Latin lustratio, a Roman purification ceremony. The first lustration bill was passed by the Polish Parliament already in 1992, but it was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland. Several other projects were then submitted and reviewed by a dedicated commission, resulting in a new lustration law passed in 1996. 1997‚Äì2007 In the years 1997‚Äì2007 lustration was dealt with by the office of Public Interest Spokesperson (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego), who analyzed lustration declarations and could initiate further proceedings, including submitting a request to the courts to initiate a legal lustration proceeding. The declarations may be seen as forms of public confessions, through which offices are exchanged for truth in a similar way as amnesty was exchanged for truth in South Africa.Roman David (2006), In Exchange for Truth: Polish Lustration and the South African Amnesty Process, Politikon. South African Journal of Political Studies 32(1): pp. 81-99. Owing to its resemblance with the South African truth and reconciliation process, the Polish lustration system of the period is seen as the most innovative among all lustration models in Central and Eastern Europe.Roman David (2011), Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.

Others oppose such a move, arguing that the release of all of the personal and confidential information contained in the files would cause unacceptable harm to innocent people.Jan Lity≈Ñski, Otwarcie teczek zalegalizuje przestƒôpstwa PRL (Opening the files will legalise the crimes of the Polish People's Republic). Gazeta Wyborcza. Controversy surrounding counterfeit files and fake police reports The former head of the State Protection Office (UOP), General Gromos≈Çaw Czempi≈Ñski, and others have described a process by which counterfeit top-secret files and faked police reports were produced by the Communist secret service in the People's Republic of Poland. Their purpose was to undermine the credibility of prominent opponents of the ruling party and many other persons by ruining their good names as private individuals. Fa≈Çszywka (pl: fa≈Çszywki) contained fake revelations about opposition members' working as alleged police informants under the communist system. The communist secret service used them frequently, said Czempi≈Ñski, adding that often the officers who \\"signed\\" them were created out of thin air. Writer Jerzy Urban noted that, if available, signatures of alleged collaborators on unrelated documents were xeroxed and pasted into fa≈Çszywkas before their reprinting. The presence of fa≈Çszywkas in the secret police archives makes the process of lustration extremely sensitive in Poland, leading to a number of highly publicized cases for slander or libel. Many prominent politicians, such as the Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski (a former Auschwitz concentration camp prisoner), and Professor Jerzy K≈Çoczowski (a member of the UNESCO Executive Board), have been among their targets. K≈Çoczowski was defended against a libelous SB fa≈Çszywka by a 2004 letter published in the newspaper Rzeczpospolita, signed by many Polish intellectuals, including Professor Jerzy Buzek, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Jan Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski, Professor W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, Professor Andrzej Zoll, J√≥zef ≈ªyci≈Ñski, Andrzej Wajda, Professor Barbara Skarga, Professor Jan Miodek, Professor Jerzy Zdrada, Aleksander Hall, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Frasyniuk, Professor Adam Galos, and Krystyna Zachwatowicz. The extensive use of fa≈Çszywkas (fake documents) in communist Poland was confirmed during a 2000 court case by a 1985 document written by Major Adam Styli≈Ñski during an internal investigation at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The document described how fa≈Çszywkas were produced and disseminated during martial law in Poland.Wojciech Czuchnowski, Maciej Sandecki (December 22, 2011), \\"SB fa≈Çszowa≈Ça kwity na Wa≈Çƒôsƒô,\\" Gazeta wyborcza.

The following day, December 28, her car was found on a dead end road at the Mercy Road off-ramp from I-15 in San Diego County. Her body was recovered at the bottom of a 65-foot ravine nearby. Her killer, Craig Allen Peyer (b. March 16, 1950), was a police officer and 13-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol (CHP). At Peyer's trial, it was revealed that he had been targeting women along the interstate and had made predatory sexual advances on multiple female drivers. He was convicted of Knott's murder in 1988. Murder Scene of the crime. On the night of December 27, 1986, 20-year-old Cara Knott was driving south on Interstate 15 from her boyfriend's home in Escondido, California, to her parents' home in El Cajon when Peyer, who was on duty in a marked CHP patrol car, directed Knott to pull off the freeway on an isolated, unfinished off-ramp. It was later discovered that Peyer also had been harassing several other female drivers in the same area by pulling them over on the same off-ramp, supposedly trying to pick them up as dates. In the Knott case, it was believed that the situation escalated to physicality when Knott threatened to report Peyer for his inappropriate actions. When he attempted to grab her, she slashed and scratched at his face. Peyer then bludgeoned her with his flashlight and strangled her to death with a rope. He then threw her body over the edge of an abandoned bridge, where she fell into the brush below. Coincidentally, two days later, while covering the investigation of the murder, a reporter with KCST-TV interviewed Officer Peyer during a ride-along segment about self- protection for female drivers. At the time of the interview, Peyer had scratches on his face which, as details of the case unfolded, were thought to have been inflicted by Knott during the struggle with him. He tried to explain they were caused when he fell against a fence in the CHP parking lot but the fence was found to be too high to have caused the scratches on Peyer's face. Moreover, within about the hour of when the murder was thought to have occurred witnesses at a gas station saw a disheveled Peyer drive in at high speed. One of them, an off-duty San Diego police officer, reported seeing the scratch marks an hour before Peyer claimed he got them. Investigation Just after the KCST broadcast, nearly two dozen telephone calls, mostly from women, were received by authorities, with the callers reporting that Peyer was the officer who had pulled them over on the same off-ramp, even though in these cases Peyer was not hostile or violent towards them. They said that while he may have been friendly with them, he also made them uncomfortable. In some cases, he gently stroked their hair and shoulders, which caused them some distress. In addition, there had been complaints about him before the murder by several women but were dismissed because of his reputation within the department. Another witness said he saw a patrol car accompanying a Volkswagen Beetle, which was thought to be the one Knott was driving, in that exact area at about the time the murder was known to have occurred. Knott last was seen alive at a Chevron gas station just two miles away from the murder scene. The attendant remembered seeing a marked CHP patrol car making a U-turn on the road just after Knott had driven away. Peyer's own logbook revealed a hasty falsification about that time as well as changes he made to several traffic tickets that had been written some time later, according to the motorists to whom the tickets were written. Forensic dentist Norman Sperber examined the rope found in his patrol car, and he determined they seemed to match the rope marks around the victim's neck, although Sperber was later barred from testifying about his findings in court. A distinctive and unusual gold rayon fiber‚Äîfound to have been made using a yellow pigment instead of a dye‚Äîfound on Knott's dress matched a shoulder patch Peyer wore on his CHP uniform. Tire tracks on the bridge showed a car had pulled out hastily leaving black marks on the pavement. Furthermore, a drop of blood was found on one of Knott's boots, which was found to be consistent with Peyer's blood type (AB negative, the rarest type) and other genetic markers, although conclusive DNA testing was not available at the time of the investigation. Microscopic purple fibers also linked Peyer to Knott's murder. Peyer's fellow officers testified to the defendant's strange actions following the murder, with his continuous requests regarding the investigation's status and his attempts to justify the perpetrator's crime as a mistake. An internal investigation showed that while he stopped many drivers for various legitimate violations, most of them were females who were driving alone. Additionally, they were of the same age group and physical description as Cara Knott. Trials The first trial resulted in a hung jury. Upon retrial, testimony regarding a potential second suspect and a hearsay explanation for the defendant's scratches was ruled inadmissible, and Peyer was found guilty of murder, the first conviction of murder by an on- duty CHP officer. On August 4, 1988, Peyer was sentenced to 25 years to life. After conviction, Peyer continued to claim his innocence. In 2004, Peyer was asked if he would contribute a sample of his DNA to a San Diego County program, which had been designed and initiated to use DNA samples to possibly exonerate wrongfully imprisoned persons, because such testing was not yet available at the time of his trial and conviction. Peyer refused to provide any DNA for the test. At an initial parole hearing in 2004 after having served 17 years, when asked why he wouldn't provide a DNA sample, Peyer refused to answer. The board denied his parole, on the grounds of his lack of remorse for the crime, as well as for his refusal to explain why he was saying he was innocent yet would not let anyone help him prove it. Aftermath Shortly after the crime and trial, a wave of incidents was reported when female drivers traveling alone refused to stop when ordered to by the police. On November 30, 2000, Sam Knott, Cara Knott's father, died of a heart attack only a few yards from the site where Cara's body was discovered, where the family had constructed a memorial garden for her. Peyer has been denied parole two additional times: in 2008 (served 21 years), and 2012 (25 years). His next eligibility for parole hearing was set to 15 years (longest time allowable under state law) from then to January 2027 (40 years in prison); he will be 77 years old. Peyer is serving his sentence at California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo, California, which is considered a \\"country club\\" and \\"garden spot\\" among California prisons. At the time of his second parole hearing in 2008, he had \\"a nearly unblemished prison record\\" and \\"worked as an electrician at the facility\\" for years, making $52 per month in salary from the job in 2003. He worked briefly as an apprentice electrician after getting fired from CHP while on bail before the trial. His third wife Karen whom he married 18 months before the murder and who visited him regularly divorced him around 2007. Around 2010, his elderly parents, who used to visit him every other month, died.

Boarding at the hotel's 23rd floor, the wheel features 17 cabins holding up to 10 passengers each. The design was developed by the Goddard Group, and the hardware was manufactured by Liechtenstein's Intamin Amusement Rides. Another attraction is Batman Dark Flight, a flying theater attraction. Studio City is home to a food court called Cosmos Food Station, on which guest can look out upon space through giant portal windows.

Bertram was born at Fenton Barns, near Dirleton, Scotland, to Hugh Bertram and Isabella Mack. Bertram emigrated to Canada in 1860. He married Helen Shiells in Almonte Ontario and settled in Peterborough, Ontario where he was a wholesale hardware dealer. From 1872 to 1878, he represented Peterborough West as a Liberal in the House of Commons. In 1881, Bertram moved to Toronto and became prominent as president of the Collins Inlet Lumber Company and as president of the Bertram Engine and Shipbuilding Company, a firm he ran with his brother George Hope Bertram (who was also an MP). Bertram was well known in public life and was chairman of the Dominion Commission on Transportation and, in 1897, he became a member of the Ontario Forestry Commission. Bertram died in Toronto and was buried in Little Lake Cemetery in Peterborough. While in Peterborough, Bertram had converted from Presbyterianism to Unitarianism, although his wife had not. A minister of each faith officiated at his funeral.

On June 17, 1950, nearly 3,000 people viewed the opening night performance of its first production, \\"The Merry Widow\\". The Muni flourished until a series of setbacks in the mid-1950s and a major fire in 1963 destroyed part of the facilities. A second fire the following year destroyed what was left. With hopes for a rebirth, a test production of \\"Bye Bye Birdie\\" was staged in Douglas Park in 1964. The Springfield community responded with such enthusiasm that the Muni was able to rebuild its facility and return to the lake site theater in 1965. That year, over 6,000 patrons saw \\"The Music Man\\" and \\"South Pacific\\". In 1967, the Muni produced three shows; \\"Brigadoon\\", \\"Guys and Dolls\\" and \\"Camelot\\" and attendance grew to 14,375. Muni bravely staged its first four-production season in 1972; \\"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown\\", \\"1776\\", \\"The Most Happy Fella\\", \\"The Sound of Music\\" and attendance jumped to over 17,000. In 2006, the Muni welcomed its one millionth patron during the run of Elton John and Tim Rice's \\"Aida\\" with a special celebration on July 29. The Muni continues to produce four shows a season and has become one of the largest community theaters in the Midwest. It is believed to be the largest organization of this type in the country that is completely self-supporting, dependent neither on grants nor tax dollars.

The notch separates Mount Mansfield, the highest peak of the Green Mountains, from Spruce Peak and the Sterling Range. Most of the notch is in Mount Mansfield State Forest. North of the height of land, Smugglers Notch is drained by the Brewster River, which drains into the Lamoille River, and into Lake Champlain. To the south, the notch is drained by the West Branch Waterbury River, then into the Little River, the Winooski River, and into Lake Champlain. In turn, Lake Champlain drains into the Richelieu River in Quebec, then into the Saint Lawrence River, and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Smugglers' Notch derives its name from activities precipitated by a request of President Thomas Jefferson to prevent American involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. The Embargo Act of 1807 forbade American trade with Great Britain and Canada. But proximity to Montreal made it a convenient trading partner, and the Act caused great hardship for Vermonters, many of whom continued the illegal trade with Canada, carrying goods and herding livestock through the Notch. Fugitive slaves also used the Notch as an escape route to Canada. The route was improved to accommodate automobile traffic in 1922 thus providing a route for liquor to be brought in from Canada during the Prohibition years. Smugglers' Notch State Park was created near the Notch by the depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps. In 2003 the park was relocated, allowing for a larger campground and new, modern facilities incorporating alternative energy. In order to preserve the work of these pioneering conservationists, all original structures created by the CCC were painstakingly relocated to the new site. The Long Trail, a 272-mile (438-km) hiking trail running the length of Vermont, traverses Smugglers‚Äò Notch. The trail down from the summit of Mt. Mansfield to the east reaches the road south of the height of the pass, and resumes across Route 108 at the Barnes Camp Visitor Center, climbing east to the summit of Madonna Peak. Smugglers' Notch Resort is located on the northeast side of the pass on the northern side of the Sterling Range with developments on Spruce Peak (referred to as Sterling Mountain by the resort), Madonna Peak (referred to as Madonna Mountain by the resort), and the lower portion of Morse Mountain. The resort takes its name from the pass. Stowe Mountain Resort straddles the southern end of the pass, with developments on both Mt. Mansfield and Spruce Peak.

He was known as Boule Noire since 1975 and worked in the music industry as a solo artist for nearly 30 years and as part of musical groups for five years. Early years Born in Bedford, Quebec, Thurston later moved to Saint-Jerome, Quebec, where he formed his first band in 1965 called les Zinconnus and produced R&B; music, his favorite musical genre. In 1969, he moved on to join the 25th Regiment band and remained with the group until the early 1970s. In the 1970s, he worked with several other Quebec artists including Robert Charlebois, Claude Dubois, Tony Roman, Nanette Workman and Michel Pagliaro. He played the piano, bass and guitar. He would later be a composer for the group Toulouse. He is also featured as back up singer, on a 45RPM Hey Lord-Valentine (1972 release) by local singer-songwriter Robert Salagan. Solo career Thurston's solo career started in 1976 when he released his first solo album titled Boule Noire. It included his first hit Aimes-tu la vie?. During his 30-year solo career, he produced at least 14 albums in both English and French. His first English album, entitled Premiere, was recorded in 1980. Thurston was one of the prominent figures in dance and R&B; music in Quebec during the 1970s and 1980s and covered songs by other artists including the Beatles hit Let it be in 1995. He also represented Canada at several international music festivals including Marseille in 1976 and UCLA in 1988. Thurston's 1978 album Aimer d'Amour was certified triple platinum. The title song would later gain success in the early 1990s when 800,000 copies were sold in Europe. Thurston became a radio show host for Montreal's Rythme FM radio station in 2000. Biography book Just prior to Thurston's death he released his autobiography called Aimes-tu la vie? after his first hit single. He revealed that he had often been disliked and mistreated. He also said that during his teenage years he nearly became a criminal, but that music helped him to survive through tough times. Death Thurston died of colorectal cancer on June 18, 2007 in Montreal. He learned of his cancer in early 2006.

Life and career Born Thomas George Owens in 1869, he trained in naval architecture in Liverpool and Newcastle-on-Tyne and worked on mercantile shipbuilding. He later worked under Philip Watts at Elswick shipyard. He became the chief naval architect for Vickers, Limited from around the turn of the 20th century up to the early 1920s. Later he became the firm's naval director. He contributed to the designs of the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser Kong≈ç and the dreadnought battleship Erin. During the First World War he was responsible for the large and diverse volume of construction in the Vickers yard. He changed his name by deed poll in 1915 to Thomas George Owens Thurston prior to attaining his knighthood. Although he took Owens as his third Christian name, his descendants conjoined his original and new surnames to take the family name of Owens-Thurston. In 1923, Thurston published a 15-page essay, \\"The Influence of the Washington Conference on Naval Design\\", in Brassey‚Äôs Naval & Shipping Annual, regarding the recent Washington Naval Conference and its associated Treaty: In 1901, he married Ada King, who predeceased him in 1946. Together they had seven sons and one daughter, one of whom also predeceased him. Thurston died on 22 January 1950 at Torquay, aged 80.

Initial construction of the central temple structures was begun in 1383, and the entire temple complex was initially dedicated in 1392. In the eighth month of the third year of Meitoku, Yoshimitsu organized a great banquet attended by all the great officers of the Imperial court and the military leaders of that time. The pomp and ceremony of the affair was said to have equaled an Imperial event.Titsingh, p. 320. In 1383, the Zen master (1311‚Äì1388) was designated by Yoshimitsu as founding abbot,Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 317. however, My≈çha insisted that the official honor be posthumously accorded to his own teacher, Mus≈ç Soseki. Joint Council for Japanese Rinzai and Obaku Zen: Sh≈çkoku-ji The formal decision to grant this posthumous honor was proclaimed in 1385.Titsingh, p. 317. The entire temple complex was destroyed by fire in 1394; but reconstruction financed by Yoshimitsu followed soon after. The temple complex has been rebuilt many times over the centuries, notably during the Onin War.Sh≈çkoku-ji official web site : Fire and Reconstruction After the Muromachi period, Sh≈çkoku-ji was supported by several national leaders such as Toyotomi Hideyoshi, his son Toyotomi Hideyori, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, all of whom helped finance the temple‚Äôs various reconstruction projects. * Hideyori financed the 1605 reconstruction of the Hatt≈ç (Dharma Hall); and this structure, designated as an Important Cultural Property, is presently the oldest building of its type in Japan. * Ieyasu donated the Sanmon (Mountain Gate) in 1609. * Emperor Go-Mizunoo donated an imperial palace building to serve as the Kaisando (Founder‚Äôs Hall). Other buildings were reconstructed during this period, but, with the notable exception of the 17th-century hatto, the temple complex was largely devastated during the conflagration of 1788.  Dragon  The Hatt≈ç hall (Ê≥ïÂ†Ç) with the dragon painting inside The Hatt≈ç hall (Ê≥ïÂ†Ç) has on its slightly domed ceiling a large painting of a dragon. The painting was done by Kan≈ç Mitsunobu (1565‚Äì1608).http://zen.rinnou.net/head_temples/11shokoku.html The dragon symbolises the rain of Buddhist teachings. When clapping the hands together, the sound reverberates between the slightly domed ceiling and the paved stone floor, echoing throughout the hall as if it was the thunder of the dragon. The main hall of Kennin-ji in Kyoto also has a large dragon on its ceiling. Buddhist center Sh≈çkoku-ji is considered to be one of the so-called Kyoto Gozan or \\"five great Zen temples of Kyoto\\". It was ranked the second of the Kyoto during the medieval period.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 317. For a short time in 1392, Sh≈çkoku-ji was considered first amongst the Gozan.Dumoulin, p. 174. Sh≈çkoku-ji is one of fourteen autonomous branches of the Rinzai school of Japanese Zen. Today the temple is headquarters for the Sh≈çkoku-ji branch of Rinzai Zen, with over ninety affiliated temples, including the famous Golden Pavilion and the Silver Pavilion temples in Kyoto.

One of the earliest of their collaborations, it was the first of their plays to appear in print, in 1607. Date and publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 20 May 1607, and was published later that year in quarto by the bookseller John Hodgets. A second imprint of the first quarto was issued in the same year. The title page offers no assignment of authorship. A few critics have suggested a 1605 date for the play,E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; p. 216. but most favor a date of 1606. A second quarto was issued in 1648 by Humphrey Moseley, with an attribution to Fletcher. The second imprint of this second quarto, issued in 1649, assigned the play to both Beaumont and Fletcher and added a subtitle to the play, calling it The Woman Hater, or The Hungry Courtier.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 219-20. Like other previously-published plays, The Woman Hater was omitted from the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. The play was later included in the second Beaumont/Fletcher folio in 1679.

Performance The title page of the first quarto states that the play was acted by the Children of Paul's, a company of child actors that is thought to have ceased activity after the summer of 1606. Authorship The consensus of critical judgement accepts the play as a Beaumont and Fletcher collaboration in which Beaumont's is the dominant hand. Cyrus Hoy, in his survey of authorship problems in the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators, provided this breakdownHoy, Cyrus H. \\"The Shares of Fletcher and His Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (III).\\" Studies in Bibliography.

Fletcher revised five scenes in Beaumont's play, scenes that deal with the chastity test. This dramaturgic element was a preoccupation with Fletcher, and recurs in his plays with Beaumont and other collaborators and his solo works as well. Other critics have agreed in substance, though not in all particulars, with Hoy's division.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S.

Characters The Duke of Milan Arrigo and Lucio - his courtiers. Valore - a count, and brother to Oriana. Gondarino - a general, the woman hater. Lazarillo - a courtier and gourmand Oriana - Valore‚Äôs sister Julia - a prostitute Mercer Panderer Synopsis The Duke of Milan cannot sleep. As he walks with his courtiers, Arrigo and Lucio, he explains that the cause of his insomnia is not some heavy matter of state, or the welfare of his people, but a woman. This particular woman is Oriana, sister to Count Valore, whom the Duke has seen but never spoken to; yet is so enticing to the Duke that he laments he would give up his rule for her and kneel at her feet. That same evening, a very special fish has come to Milan. Specifically, the head of an umbrannes fish delivered to the Duke of Milan and passed on to his friend, the general Gondarino. This rare delicacy has attracted the attention of the courtier Lazarillo, a gourmand who spends his days hunting down the best dishes in Milan and securing invitations to events where they are served. Meanwhile, Valore is at odds with his sister, determined to shield her from the corrupting influence of court. Though a mere fifteen years old, Oriana is determined to experience all the outside world has to offer, and against her brother's wishes, sets out to court. Though distressed by his sister's actions, Valore is glad at the approach of Lazarillo, hoping the gourmand will provide him some distraction. There is none to be had though, as Lazarillo, determined in his quest for the umbrannes, refuses Valore's request to dine with him, instead pleading the Count to present him to the Duke, in hopes of wrangling an invitation to the Duke's dinner. Valore acquiesces, but for his own amusement orders his spies to accompany Lazarillo, in the off chance the gourmand make some sort of treasonous comment. While Lazarillo has been busy soliciting an introduction from Valore, his boy has discovered that the umbrannes is no longer in the Duke's possession, but has been sent to the general Gondarino. Agreeing to meet Valore later, Lazarillo heads off in pursuit of an invitation to the general's dinner. Unfortunately for Lazarillo, the umbrannes is no longer in the general's possession. When first presented with the fish head, Gondarino assumes it is sent by a woman. He, therefore, refuses it, as he believes that all women are \\"whores.\\" When his servant informs him that the umbrannes is, in fact, a gift from the Duke, Gondarino has it sent to his mercer, as remuneration for a previous unpaid shipment of silks. In truth, Gondarino barely pays the delicacy any notice, as he is preoccupied with bemoaning the degenerate nature of women. As if on cue, Oriana arrives at his door, seeking shelter from a sudden hailstorm. Though denied sanctuary by Gondarino on account of her sex, the obstinate Oriana barges in anyway. Though the general flings insults at her, Oriana responds with nothing but pleasantries; that is, up until the point that she informs Gondarino that she sought out his house specifically because of his reputation as a woman hater, hoping to amuse herself by aggravating him. Suddenly, the Duke and his two courtiers, having also been caught in the streets by the hailstorm, appear at Gondarino's door. While Gondarino rails against the presence of a woman in his house, the Duke begins to suspect his protests are a ruse designed to conceal an illicit love affair with his beloved Oriana. As he shares his suspicions with Lucio, Valore and Lazarillo appear, the latter still on the hunt for the umbrannes head. Valore, as promised, provides Lazarillo with an introduction to the Duke, who receives him warmly and extends an invitation to dinner, which Lazarillo, not to be distracted from his quest, denies. Upon hearing his prize is no longer in Gondarino's possession, he sets out after it with Valore in tow. Oriana, determined to torment Gondarino \\"into madness,\\" insists on dining with him, resolved that \\"the more he hates, the more I'll seem to love.\\" Oriana uses every tool at her disposal to convince Gondarino of her love, up to and including serenading him. Later, the Duke questions Gondarino as to the nature of his relationship with the girl. Sensing his chance to avenge himself, Gondarino slanders Oriana by not only confirming the Duke's suspicions but by denouncing her as an \\"arrant whore.\\" Anguished and disbelieving, the Duke rushes out. Oriana enters, and Gondarino, feigning love for her, confesses his slanders. He then vows to repair the damage he has done and requests Oriana retire to his country house while he does so. Beguiled by his seeming honesty, Oriana agrees, unaware that Gondarino has sent her to a brothel. As Lazarillo heads to the mercer's house, Valore's spies met with Lucio, having cobbled together enough random snatches of Lazarillo's statements as to manufacture the appearance of treason. Lazarillo arrives at the mercer's house too late, as the mercer has already traded the fish to a panderer in exchange for a bride. Learning this, Lazarillo sets out to the panderer's brothel, the same location to which Oriana has been sent. At court, Valore defends his sister to the Duke while Gondarino stands by his lies. To settle the issue, Gondarino proposes to take the Duke and Valore to see her transgressions with their own eyes. Thus they set out for the panderer's brothel. Also en route is the mercer, looking for his promised bride, and Lazarillo, hunting down his prized fish. The mercer arrives first and enters the brothel. Following him is Lazarillo, who secures an invitation to dinner from Julia, a prostitute. He enters the brothel but is promptly arrested for treason by Valore's spies before he can eat. As he is dragged away, he vows to marry Julia if she will only save the fish until he returns. When the Duke, Gondarino, and Valore arrive, they see Oriana at the brothel, ad the Duke is convinced of her crimes. Back at court, the Duke, Gondarino, and Valore argue over Oriana's fate. It is decided that her virtue will be put to the test, her life forfeit should she fail. While the three noblemen secretly watch, Arrigo comes to Oriana with a proposition. He tells her that, as punishment for her transgression, it has been decided that she will be put to death. He goes on to say that the only way she might avoid execution is through Arrigo's intervention, which comes at a price: she must sleep with him. Oriana refuses, and in doing so proves her virtue. The Duke reveals himself and claims Oriana as his bride. As punishment, Gondarino is bound to a chair and is made to suffer as Oriana directs the ladies of the court to fondle him. Lazarillo is pardoned by Valore and immediately sets out to the brothel. He keeps his vow, marries Julia, and finally gets to feast on the umbrannes. Psychology Critics have commentedRichard Levin, The Multiple Plot in English Renaissance Drama, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971; pp. 151-4. on the play's curious juxtaposition of two unrelated portrayals of obsessive psychology. In the main plot, Gondarino is a dedicated misogynist who strives to avoid any and all contact with women. The primary subplot traces Lazarello's obsessive quest for, of all things, a really nice piece of fish. \\"Beaumont juggles four plots with considerable ease, offering a bit of something for everyone: farce, bawdy wit, court satire, and a 'high' romantic plot.\\"Lee Bliss, \\"Beaumont and Fletcher,\\" in: A Companion to Renaissance Drama, Arthur F. Kinney, ed., London, Blackwell, 2002; p. 526.
