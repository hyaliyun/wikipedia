Background  In the middle of the 19th century, most of the territory of Balkans was still part of the Ottoman Empire, with several newly established independent or autonomous entities like Serbia and Greece. All of them struggled to expand their influence and territory at Ottoman expense. Their intention was strongly opposed by Austria who opposed development of Balkan nations and revolutions in the Ottoman provinces of Europe (Rumelia). Napoleon III was the champion of the idea of Balkan nationalism and fostered Serbia and Greece to build alliances and undermine Ottoman influence in the region. France planned to resolve the Balkan Eastern Question through gathering of all Balkan Slavic people, including Bulgarians, around Serbia as their pillar. This was not only informally suggested by French diplomats since 1861, but also formally proposed in Saint Petersburg in 1867. The establishment of Balkan alliances was supported and aided by Russia because it corresponded with its policy of promoting Balkan unity. The establishment of the Balkan alliance was campaigned by Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá of Serbia. To establish the First Balkan Alliance, the Principality of Serbia signed a series of contracts in the period 1866‚Äì68. The first contract was signed with Montenegro in 1866. The next contracts were signed in autumn of 1866 with the People's Party in Croatia-Slavonia, with the Bulgarian Revolutionary Secret Society in 1867, with Greece in 1867 and with Romania in 1868.  Negotiations  The Treaty of Alliance and Friendship () was signed between Serbia and Greece on . The treaty had been negotiated by Greek minister Petros Zanos and Serbian ministers Jovan Ristiƒá, Milan Petronijeviƒá and Ilija Gara≈°anin (who had met with Zanos at the beginning). Earlier discussions had been organized in Vienna. In the preamble, it is said that \\"the position of Christians in the East is unbearable\\" and that they need to free themselves. It is also stressed that the Ottoman Empire poses a threat, that it might attack the two countries, and that the alliance will forestall that danger. It was proposed by Greek Foreign Minister Charilaos Trikoupis and was the first and only alliance signed between Greece and another country during the 19th century. It was also the first attempt at an alliance between Balkan nations against the Ottoman Empire. The two states agreed on the lands each of them would occupy following a successful war against the Ottomans. = Division of territories = The talks had been made difficult by questions on division of territories: the Greeks sought to establish only the minimum based on the population, equality of origin and historical traditions, whereas Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá sought the minimum of territory, assuming Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Old Serbia from the Drim to the Iskar. The Greeks, in that case, sought Thessaly, Epirus, and Macedonia between Thessaly and the Sea, Thrace and Balkan Mountains. Finally, the Greek proposal was accepted: Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia, Epirus and Thessaly to Greece. The possibility of a Balkan alliance was predicted, and the establishment of it also as a principle for a national self-determination in the Near East. A special act included the rights of both sides, that if they were unable to realize the minimum of annexations in Article 4 (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Epirus and Thessaly), they would seek compensation in other neighboring provinces of the Ottoman Empire, based on mutual origin of the population.  Ratification  On , the ratifications were exchanged. The Serbian delegate, artillery lieutenant colonel Franjo Zah, had arrived in Athens on . On the military convention on war operations against the Ottoman Empire was signed between Serbia and Greece by signatories Zah and major Nikolaos Zanos of the Greek military command. The treaty never came into effect, as Prince Mihailo was murdered soon afterwards, on 10 June 1868.

Moreover, the Ghassanids were adamant supporters of the Monophysite church and their relationship with Tubna may have been based on their support for its monastery.

Text In the short-verse text of the MadhyamakƒÅla·πÉkƒÅra, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita details his philosophical synthesis of the conventional truth of Yogacara with the ultimate truth of the Madhyamaka, assisted by Buddhist logic with a lengthy discussion of the \\"neither one nor many\\" argument. =Dharmic dialogue= Though somewhat lyrical, it is a summary and a key to his encyclopedic Tattvasamgraha. It has the fullness of the Sutrayana and Mahayana traditions' development in its place of origin before the Buddhist tradition of India was transposed by the cultures of the Far East (such as China and Japan) and elsewhere (such as Ceylon and Kashmir), where Buddhism was already flourishing in culturally specific forms. The text refutes challenges of Buddhist systems and tenets from within the tradition, and is a pedagogical discourse on the development of the yana; the philosophical challenges posed by the non-Buddhist religions and non-Dharmic traditions of India, and crystallizes a dialectical sophistication of Indian logic and the clarity of debate expected of a Khenpo of Nalanda Vihara. The text was seminal in the tradition of Samye which became known as a Nyingma institution in contrast to the emergent Sarma traditions of Atisha's (980-1054) translation phase. It documents the Nyingma view of the Two Truths, making it a canonical work. Although the text was marginalized due to the rise of the Prasa·πÖgika subschool of MƒÅdhyamaka, it was revived by Ju Mipham's (1846‚Äì1912) 1876 Commentary.Doctor, Thomas H. (trans.)

Speech of Delight: Mipham's Commentary of Shantarakshita's Ornament of the Middle Way. Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications. , p.219 Ju Mipham's commentary on the verse is likewise translated by both sources. Five assertions Ju Mipham made five assertions not unique to ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita's view:≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.122-141 # Objects (fully qualified objects of comprehension) are posited only with respect to things able to function. # Consciousness in the absence of an object which knows and illuminates itself is uncommon. # The external appears through (or due to) one's own mind and is considered mind-only. # The ultimate is divided into enumerated and non-enumerated ultimates. # In the enumerated ultimate, objects found by individual valid cognition are understood without contradiction. =First= In the first assertion, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita makes the Sautrantika distinction that objects of cognition are of two kinds: abstract, theoretical mental objects (including generalities, like classes of objects and their names) and actual things, defined as things which function. Although the Sautantrika made that distinction for conventional and ultimate truth, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita discards theoretical or general objects and discusses actual things as conventional truth. He incorporates Dharmakirti's cognition which analyzes conventionalities, connecting that with cognition which analyzes for ultimacy.≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.122-123 =Second= In the second assertion, a self-reflective awareness (svasa·πÉvedana) exists; consciousness can be aware of objects of cognition. This position was later critiqued by Je Tsongkhapa as implying that a self-reflective awareness is separate from objects of cognition. Ju Mipham later qualified its meaning; cognition is self-aware, not a separate material thing.≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita & Ju Mipham (2005) p.123 Samye Monastery, founded by Shantaraksita =Third= In the third assertion, the consciousness-only view of conventional appearances is the best way to progress. Still affirming the supremacy of the Madhyamaka school when students analyze for ultimacy, when relating to conventionalities the mind- only position is recommended.≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.123-125 =Fourth= The fourth assertion distinguishes between the ultimate way of abiding established by the Madhyamaka method (the non-enumerated ultimate) and an approximate (enumerated) ultimate: a lesser, conventional understanding of the ultimate which leads to the non-enumerated ultimate.≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.125-135 As part of his explanation of why this is useful, Mipham quotes Gorampa (who references the four conceptual extremes) (Wylie: mtha' bzhi; Sanskrit: caturanta): To analyze the extremes of existence and non-existence, Ju Mipham advises students to contemplate and establish the lack of inherent existence and then contemplate the extreme of non-existence. In contemplating step by step and enumerating the conceptual extremes, a student progresses toward the ultimate. When all extremes have been analyzed, they reach the non-enumerative (true) ultimate. =Fifth= In the fifth assertion, analysis of objects with respect to approximate (enumerated) ultimates does not create a problem of true establishment. A distinction can be made when analyzing for each case, including the two approaches to cognition (one for the conventional domain and the other to analyze for ultimacy) which are his additions to the Pramana tradition of valid cognition. Mipham uses this demonstration in his commentary to point out a problem with Je Tsongkhapa's approach of negating the predicate of \\"true establishment\\" instead of the object of perception, which is avoided in ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita's approach. Mipham also notes that many Prasa·πÖgika writers (similar to their Svatantrika counterparts) made positive assertions to move students closer to the ultimate view, pointing out that the distinction between Prasangika and Svatantrika lies in how students are taught about conventionalities and not in the consideration of ultimate truth. He concludes that Je Tsongkhapa, in making a distinction based on true establishment, proposes a Svatantrika rather than a Prasangika approach.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.135-147 FootnotesNotesReferences * Banerjee, Anukul Chandra.

It is Roth's 30th book and concerns \\"an aging stage actor whose empty life is altered by a 'counterplot of unusual erotic desire'.\\" PlotPart one= Simon Axler is a famed sexagenarian stage actor who suddenly and inexplicably loses his gift. His weak attempts at portraying Prospero and Macbeth on stage at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., lead to poor reviews, sending Axler into a profound depression and causing him to give up acting and contemplate suicide with a shotgun he keeps in his attic. His wife, Victoria, a former ballerina, is unable to deal with Axler's depression and moves to California, where their son lives. Axler checks himself into a psychiatric hospital on the advice of his physician and stays there for 26 days. In the hospital, Axler meets another patient, Sybil Van Buren, who tells him about catching her second husband sexually abusing her young daughter. She expresses shame at not immediately reporting her husband or removing him from the home and admits to attempting suicide. Sybil asks Axler whether he would be willing to kill her husband and he tells her he fears he would \\"botch the job\\". Months after his stint in the hospital, Axler's agent, Jerry Oppenheim, visits him at his upstate New York home to tell him about an offer to play James Tyrone in Long Day's Journey into Night. Axler refuses, fearing another failure. In the fan mail Oppenheim brings, Axler finds a letter from Sybil, thanking him for listening to her problems in the hospital. She says she did not recognize him at the time but decided to write him after catching one of his old movies on TV. =Part two= Pegeen Mike Stapleford, the 40-year-old daughter of two actors he performed with around the time she was born, pays Axler a visit at his house. Pegeen has just moved nearby to work as a professor at a Vermont women's college after ending a six-year relationship with a woman who decided to undergo sex reassignment surgery to become a man. Pegeen's job was secured after she slept with the school's \\"smitten\\" dean, Louise Renner. Simon and Pegeen begin an affair despite Pegeen's having lived as a lesbian for the previous 17 years. Louise is furious that Pegeen has broken off their relationship and begins stalking her. Months later, Louise calls Pegeen's parents in Lansing, Michigan, to tell them that their daughter is now sleeping with Axler. Pegeen is distressed that her parents have learned about the relationship she wanted kept secret. Her father, Asa, tells her he disapproves because of the age difference but Simon suspects he merely envies his professional success. Asa directs community theater in Michigan. =Part three= Axler reads in the local newspaper that Sybil has shot and killed her estranged husband. He contacts Sybil's sister and offers to help with her murder defense. One night, Pegeen \\"offers\\" Axler a 19-year-old college student of her acquaintance named Lara. Lara becomes a fantasy of his and a character in Pegeen's sexual role-playing. Soon after, while Axler and Pegeen are dining out, he notices Tracy, a young woman getting drunk at the restaurant bar, and they take her home for a threesome. Afterward, Axler asks her why she agreed to go home with them, and she admits she recognized him as a famous actor. After this adventure, Axler feels rejuvenated and decides he wants to perform in Long Day's Journey after all. He also decides that he wants to father a child with Pegeen and visits a fertility specialist without telling her. Two weeks later, Pegeen ends their relationship, telling Axler she \\"made a mistake.\\" He accuses her of leaving him to be with Tracy and believes Pegeen's parents have turned her against him. He calls her parents, shouting at them in an angry tirade. After the call, Axler kills himself with his shotgun. Critical response The reviews for The Humbling largely suggested that, after several books that had received high critical acclaim, Roth had taken a misstep, to be blamed in part on his extremely prolific output in recent years. In a highly critical piece for The Guardian and The Observer, William Skidelsky resoundingly panned the novel and called for Roth to slow down, declaring: > Roth's new novel is, by his standards, dismayingly poor...it can hardly be > called a novel at all; it is more an old man's sexual fantasy dressed up in > the garb of literature. There are, of course, redeeming features: an > interesting initial conceit, the usual beautifully controlled writing. And > the novel asks interesting questions about ageing and what it does to you. > But these things aren't nearly enough to make up for the absurdity at its > core. Skidelsky concluded by remarking, \\"On reading such a piece of scandalous frippery, it is hard not to conclude that Roth, rather than forging furiously ahead, should indeed be slowing down a little. And perhaps he should be getting out of the house a bit more.\\" Further negative notices came from Michiko Kakutani in the New York Times, which criticized the novel as \\"an overstuffed short story... a slight, disposable work\\". Kakutani added that Roth seemed to be \\"...simply going through the motions of ticking off plot points on a spindly, ill-conceived outline.\\" Mixed but slightly more positive notices were also forthcoming. The Daily Telegraph, which despite also declaring the novel to be \\"slight\\", went on to praise The Humbling as a \\"grave‚Äîand important‚Äînovel... a fine, unsettling piece of writing that deserves its place in Roth‚Äôs canon... His new work will not detain you long, but it will linger.\\" 2008 Booker Prize winner Aravind Adiga in his review for The Times declared the novel to be \\"...the most entertaining depressing book you‚Äôll read this year\\", comparing it to Roth's own highly praised Sabbath's Theater and The Human Stain, but went on to add caveats. Adiga, despite calling the novel \\"an original and unsettling book\\", also considered the novel \\"a failure\\", adding, \\"the language is vibrant, the sex is smutty, there are some lovely surprises in the narrative ‚Äî yet, like Everyman, it lacks the wider social engagement that made American Pastoral or I Married a Communist so memorable. Like Everyman, it is a voluptuous essay on extinction masquerading as a novel.\\" One of the most positive reviews of the novel came from Jesse Kornbluth who declared it \\"Roth's best work in years; sentence for sentence, paragraph for paragraph, he's still the most readable serious writer we've got.\\" Kornbluth went on to praise numerous aspects of the novel summing up with what amounted to an open tribute to Roth and his writing: \\"This is a long way from the summer romance of Goodbye, Columbus. But Philip Roth was 26 when he published that. He's 76 now. He's outlived all of his rivals. He's our most prominent novelist. And over 30 books, he's learned how to disturb us ‚Äî and keep us reading. The Humbling is haunting proof.\\" Film adaptation In December 2009, actor Al Pacino purchased the rights to the novel for the purposes of creating a film adaptation. The film, directed by Barry Levinson, was released in the USA on January 23, 2015.

Bland won nine caps for Wales over a period of four years. International career Bland was first selected for Wales in a match against Scotland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship. Replacing Cardiff team mate George Avery Young, Bland was chosen to face England in the opening match of the tournament, under the captaincy of Newport's Charlie Newman. Although the match was to be played at Stradey Park in Llanelli, the game was moved to a nearby cricket ground as the English felt the original pitch was still frozen- over. The game ended in a nil-nil draw, the best the Welsh had so far achieved over the English. Bland kept his place for the next two games of the Championship, a loss away to Scotland; where Wales unsuccessfully trialed the four three-quarter system for the first time, and a win over Ireland, played at the neutral ground of Birkenhead Park in England. The 1888 Championship was played without England, after the team withdrew when their union fell out with their Scottish counterpart. Bland played in both games, which saw Wales win their first match over Scotland thanks to a Thomas Pryce-Jenkins try, but in a reversal of fortunes the very next match saw the Welsh lose to Ireland; the first victory for the Irish over Wales. Towards the end of 1888, Bland was selected for the Welsh game to face the touring New Zealand Natives played at St. Helen's Ground, Swansea. The Welsh players experienced a hostile home crowd during the match due to the lack of Swansea players in the squad;Smith (1972), pg 17. but after trialing the four three-quarter system again, were able to beat the MƒÅori opposition by a goal and two tries to nil. Bland played against the same touring MƒÅori team, just seven days later, when his club team, Cardiff, hosted the New Zealanders at the Cardiff Arms Park. A goal from Norman Biggs and a rare joint try from Sydney Nicholls and W.T. MorganSmith (1972), pg 21. was enough to give Cardiff the win. Bland failed to play in either of the two games of the 1889 Home Nations Championship, but was re- selected for the first game of the 1890 tournament. The opening game to Scotland was the last match for captain Frank Hill, and after losing the game, Welsh hopes were not high for the next encounter against the returning England team. Played at Crown Flatt in Dewsbury, Wales managed to beat the English for the first time in the national team's history, thanks to a clever try from William Stadden. Bland's final game was played on St. David's Day, 1890 away to Ireland. The game ended in a draw, though it is unknown if Bland was one of the nine players who found themselves in Dublin Court the next day after 'riotous behaviour' following the after match-dinner.Godwin (1987), pg 25. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 463. * 1887, 1890 * 1887, 1888, 1890 * 1888 * 1887, 1888, 1890 References ;Notes ;Sources  * Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Rugby union forwards Category:1866 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Cardiff RFC players Category:London Welsh RFC players Category:Sportspeople from Haverfordwest ","title":"Alexander Bland"},{"id":"21730815","text":"Bartki () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Lelkowo, within Braniewo County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, close to the border with the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia.

It stars Michele Placido, Claudio Amendola, Alessandra Di Sanzo, Francesco Benigno, Roberto Mariano, Maurizio Prollo, Filippo Genzardi, Alfredo Li Bassi, Salvatore Termini, Luigi Maria Burruano, Gianluca Favilla, Giovanni Alamia and Tony Sperandeo.  Synopsis  Mery per sempre is set in Rosaspina, a fictionary juvenile detention centre (the actual one is called Malaspina) in Palermo, Sicily, during the 1980s. The protagonist, Marco Terzi (Michele Placido), is a teacher who has been transferred to Palermo from Milan. He obtains a temporary position as teacher inside the institution, waiting to start teaching in a high school, and has great difficulty in establishing a rapport with the young, hostile students; in particular, Natale Sperandeo (Francesco Benigno), the leader of the group, who is inside for murder, and Pietro Giancona (Claudio Amendola). Terzi's situation is further complicated when Mario Libassi (Alessandra Di Sanzo), a transvestite prostitute, nicknamed Mery, falls in love with him and when Claudio severely hits Carmelo who wanted rape him. With the passing of time, however, Terzi slowly gains the respect and admiration of his students, even from the most hardened of the young men, but he comes in contrast with the director and the warders. After the death of Pietro, killed during a robbery after a jailbreak, he decides to refuse the well paid position in the high school to stay with the boys. Forever Mery was followed in 1990 with the sequel Ragazzi fuori, featuring most of the same cast and characters, with the exception of Placido and Amendola. The film Mery per sempre was the inspiration behind a song with the same name by the popular Israeli singer Ivri Lider.http://www.nrg.co.il/online/archive/ART32/401.html  References  * Category:1989 films Category:Italian films Category:Films set in Palermo Category:Sicilian-language films Category:Italian LGBT-related films Category:Films directed by Marco Risi ","title":"Forever Mery"},{"id":"21731017","text":"Bardyny () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wilczƒôta, within Braniewo County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

History The village was first mentioned as Schklodien or Sklodien, a name of Old Prussian origin, that probably refers to the initial owner \\"Sklode\\", which is an Old Prussian name. The village was the property of the von Werner family until 1643, when the area was bought by a member of the Dohna family and remained within this family up to 1945. Christoph I. zu Dohna-Schlodien inherited the village in 1688 and decided to build a representative palace. He employed Jean de Bodt with the construction, which was erected in 1701 -1704.History of Schlodien In 1802 Carl Ludwig zu Dohna-Schlodien voluntarily released the local peasants out of the traditional subservience. In 1809 the later Prussian Kings Frederick William IV of Prussia and Wilhelm estivated at Schlodien as well as Max von Schenkendorf in 1813/14. At the end of World War II the Palace was plundered by the Red Army throughout the East Prussian Offensive in early 1945. The area became part of Poland and the Palace was used as a grain storehouse and later unused. In 1986 the Palace burnt down, today only ruins are left.

It is considered the secondFiestas de Espa√±a. El Carnaval de TenerifeEl Carnaval de Tenerife most popular and internationally known carnival, after the one held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Partially for this reason, the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is twinned with the city of Rio de Janeiro.Fiestas de Espa√±a. El Carnaval de TenerifeEl Carnaval de Tenerife In 1980, it was declared a Tourist Festival of International Interest by the Secretary of State for Tourism. The Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife aspires to become a World Heritage Site,http://www.santacruzmas.com/SantaCruzMas09.asp?IdMenu=10&IdSeccion;=41&IdSubseccion;=238 as a declaration of its status as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO would promote the festival internationally. In 1987, singer Celia Cruz went to the Carnival Chicharrero with Billo's Caracas Boys; attended by 250,000 people, the concert was registered in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest gathering of people in an outdoor plaza to attend a concert. In 2019 for its part, more than 400,000 people danced to the rhythm of Juan Luis Guerra during the Carnival of the day thus surpassing the record reached in 1987 with Celia Cruz. Although, however, due to the unexpected mass response there was no notary officializing this figure for the Guinness Book.Santa Cruz bate el r√©cord de Celia Cruz The festivities on the streets of Santa Cruz de Tenerife start on the Friday before Carnival with an opening parade, which reaches its height during the night when thousands of people in fancy dresses dance until the early hours of the next day. The party continues night after night until Ash Wednesday. That day, people of Santa Cruz de Tenerife celebrate the \\"entierro de la sardina\\" (burial of the sardine), and with this event the carnival is officially over. However, the party starts up again the following weekend, known as the weekend of the pi√±ata. The festival has two parts: the official Carnival, and the Carnival on the street. The official carnival has more than a hundred groups, including murgas, comparsas, rondallas and other musical groups. The street carnival is more loosely organized, and comprises the people celebrating on the streets. Thousands of people come each day to the streets to participate, most of whom wear a disguise in accordance with Carnival tradition.  History  alt=Large group of musicians in red clown costumes, in front of a gazebo The Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has been celebrated since the time of the earliest European settlement, and possibly earlier. In 1605 Gaspar Luis Hidalgo alluded to the habit of reversing the sexes in dress. Early written references date from the end of the 18th century, in the writings of visitors. The journal of Lope Antonio de la Guerra Pe√±a in 1778 includes a dance held in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where he then talked about comparsas (bands playing conga music). In 1783, the Corregidor reported the use of masks \\"being banned by royal instructions\\". In practice the ban was not carried out, and a carnival feature was the mixing of the masked upper class with the common people. = Governmental ban = During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì1935), and General Franco (1940‚Äì1960), the Carnival was known as \\"Winter holiday\\" as a ruse to circumvent the ban that had been enacted against it. Despite the ban, the festival continued to take place in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and C√°diz, Spain. In 1954 with Los Bigotudos (today known as Afilarm√≥nica NIFU-NiF√°) performed the first murga (musical theater). = Promotional posters = Since 1962, a poster for each year of the Carnival has been created. Artists such as John Galarza, Gurrea, Javier Mariscal Dokoupil C√©sar Manrique Cuixart Pedro Gonz√°lez, Fierro, Paco Martinez, Mel Ramos, Enrique Gonzalez, Maribel Nazca, Elena Lecuona and many others have contributed to their designs. For the 2009 Carnival, it was proposed that an open competition take place for participants to design the official poster for that year. = Traditional events = The main venues for Carnival competitions and the election of the Queen have been the Teatro Guimer√° (until 1985) and the Plaza de Toros (1986‚Äì1988) Its central circular stage was decorated with a silver crown in 1986‚Äì1987 and a golden crown in 1988. Additional venues have included the Plaza de Espa√±a in 2005, the Centro Internacional de Ferias y Congresos de Tenerife and the Esplanade of Parks in 2008. Since the construction of the Centro Internacional de Ferias y Congresos de Tenerife, additional Carnival venues have varied. In recent years tickets for several events (especially the Final Murgas Adultas Contest and the Gala of the Queen) have sold out completely (over 20,000 seats) between 15 and 60 minutes after tickets go on sale. The Gala of the Queen, with a stage spectacle that crowns the first lady of the Carnival and groups awarded for their efforts, is broadcast each year by a national network for the entire country and broadcast via satellite to all continents. Networks covering the event include RTVE, Televisi√≥n Canaria, Antena 3 Televisi√≥n, Canal +, Galavisi√≥n and Telecinco. = Capital of Carnival = In May 2000, the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife became the Carnival Capital of the World and headquarters of the 20th Convention of the Federation of European Carnival Cities (FECC). The convention, held on the island of Gran Canaria, featured appearances by Carnival performers and concluded with performers from the Carnival of Las Palmas. = Themes = Carnival Poster 1976 on a tile located on Constitution Avenue (Santa Cruz de Tenerife). * 1987 ‚Äì Rome: This was the first year that the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, was themed. For this, the perimeter of the Plaza de Espa√±a was surrounded by an Ionic- style paired colonnade, giving the appearance of a circular Roman temple. The portal of the lintel of each pair of columns, was adorned by two Atlantic mackerel (chicharros) crowned with laurels. This was the year the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife entered the Guinness Book of World Records. * 1988 ‚Äì Wild World: The colonnade of the previous year was recycled, painted in salmon and topped with white palm leaves made from fiberglass, giving the appearance of palm trees. Every two or three palms were on platforms which were reproductions of previous carnival Queen costumes in white fiberglass. A model of King Kong stood on a pedestal * 1989 ‚Äì Millennial Egypt: The Plaza de Espa√±a replaced the Plaza de Toros as the main stage. It was decorated with two large sphinxes and an Egyptian-style palace gate. * 1990 ‚Äì Story World: The scene at the Plaza de Espa√±a was that of a story in two parts. One story was \\"happy\\" (with a smiley-faced house) and the other \\"dark\\", with a tree whose branches were shaped like hands in a tribute to the film Poltergeist. * 1991 ‚Äì Space: The tower of the Plaza de Espa√±a was integrated into the scenery, transforming it into a giant telecommunications antenna dominated by metal, neon and laser lights. * 1992 ‚Äì Cinema: The stage of the Plaza de Espa√±a evoked a Western movie set. * 1993 ‚Äì Circus: The stage was extended to almost half the surface of the square. This was the first year that Antena 3 Television broadcast the Queen Gala nationally and internationally (on Antena 3 Internacional); previously, it had been broadcast by RTVE, TVE1 and La2 TVE Internacional. * 1994 ‚Äì Atl√°ntida: The stage was highlighted with oceanic colors. The gala was presented by journalist Willy Garc√≠a. The queen that year was Maria Candelaria Rodriguez, who wore \\"Diva\\" (by Marcos Marrero) for Casinos de Tenerife. * 1995 ‚Äì The Thousand and One Nights: Scenes from the Arabian story adorned the stage of the Plaza de Espa√±a, inspired by the film Aladdin. * 1996 ‚Äì Mexico: The main stage of the Carnival moved to the newly opened Centro Internacional de Ferias y Congresos de Tenerife. The theatrical set evokes a neighborhood in Mexico, and the characters were stereotypical negative portrayals of Mexicans as \\"drunk, lazy and violent\\". The Mexican Consul was in attendance, and it was broadcast in America by Galavision and in Spain by Telecinco. The show nearly created a diplomatic conflict; Televisa closed its office in Tenerife, which was owned by Canal 7 del Atl√°ntico (ECO Noticias). Construction errors on the set required help for the queen candidates to cross the stage. Its highlight was a performance by Enrique Iglesias. * 1997 ‚Äì Prehistory: The set was simple: a rocky mountain made of papier-m√¢ch√© in the center of the Centro Internacional de Ferias y Congresos de Tenerife. * 1998 ‚Äì The Middle Ages: The set of that year was a medieval castle with flags, coats of arms and colored conical roofs. * 1999 ‚Äì Comic World: This marked a return to the Plaza de Espa√±a, with a set filled with superheroes. Highlights were Captain America (known as \\"Super Chicha\\") and a giant bust of Lara Croft. Carnival Poster 1992 on a tile located on Constitution Avenue (Santa Cruz de Tenerife). * 2000 ‚Äì Pirates: A pirate galleon was the centerpiece, surrounded by palm trees, islands, beaches and waves. * 2001 ‚Äì Space Odyssey: A spaceship was the main feature at the Plaza de Espa√±a. * 2002 ‚Äì The Roaring 20s: The scene of the Plaza de Espa√±a was decorated with motifs reminiscent of the first two decades of the 20th century. The Eiffel Tower was featured on stage, with the Statue of Liberty and the Golden Gate Bridge behind the Eiffel Tower. * 2003 ‚Äì The Far East (China): The center of the Plaza de Espa√±a was occupied by a Chinese temple in red. A papier-m√¢ch√© sculpture of the Buddha was withdrawn after protests by the Buddhist community of Tenerife, who objected to a religious figure being used frivolously. The main streets of Santa Cruz de Tenerife were decorated red and gold, with Chinese lanterns. * 2004 ‚Äì Celia Cruz: The stage at the Plaza de Espa√±a was decorated as a Cuban neighborhood, with a neon sign reading \\"Celia Cruz\\" in blue. * 2005 ‚Äì Hollywood Musicals: The stage of the Spanish Steps was inspired by Hollywood black-and-white musicals. * 2006 ‚Äì Tribes: The stage was again moved to the Centro Internacional de Ferias y Congresos de Tenerife.

The gala began with the projection on the screens of a child who had found a book in an enchanted forest and raised it from among the chairs of the Fairgrounds to the Carnival stage. It was a story with fairies, enchanted trees and unicorns... The overture, due to the quality of the projections, enhanced the stage, with a cascade that set itself on fire, a great virtual dragon and others were projected on the stage. One of the most emotional moments of the night came when the young Saida Prieto could fulfill her dream of returning to parade as a candidate at the gala of the election of the queen, something that in 2013 could not perform, because minutes before climbing to the scenario a fateful accident caused the girl and her suit to end in flames.

The introduction of the same allowed the public to delve into the deep sea, where they waited, a host of aquatic animals. One of the most emotional moments of the night took place when the audience also stood up to cheer and support a candidate who, while marching, fell to the ground and, before the weight of her suit, could not get up by herself. The presenter of the gala was the journalist Laura Afonso, who throughout the event was accompanied by other presenters, such as the last three queens of the carnival, Maria Rozman, Elvis Sanfiel or K-Narias.

Given this unexpected fact and lack of a notary, the record could not be included in the Guinness Book of Records. * 2020 ‚Äì The 1950s: Known as \\"El Carnaval de La Calima\\", due to the dust in suspension from the Sahara desert that covered the entire Canary archipelago during the first days of the carnival celebration in the street.

The gala was directed by designers Marcos Marrero and Mar√≠a D√≠az. In the final moment, only eight queen candidates took the stage, because despite the large dimensions of the stage, it fell short to accommodate all the candidates at the same time. During the gala, which started with an overture based on the popular song \\"Santa Cruz en Carnaval\\", 16 candidates paraded through a stage that, like every year, also received the Queen of the Venezuelan Canarian Home. The gala featured singer Soraya Arnelas, who in addition to singing acted as master of ceremonies with Alexis Hern√°ndez and Pedro Rodr√≠guez. * 2021 - Carnivals of the World: = Noise complaint = Parade of the Saturday of Carnival in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (2016). In January 2006 a group of neighbors in Santa Cruz de Tenerife filed a complaint with the Board of Administrative Disputes, supported by eight community buildings and ten residents of the area known as the \\"ring\\" (the middle of the festivities). They asked for suspension of the Acts of Carnival in the city center. Several volunteer groups decided in the lawsuit to seek damages. The City Council awarded at least 180 million euros to cover collateral damage. Finally, according to the ruling \\"the generic request for suspension of the carnival is in no way excessive and could be subject to a full assessment. It is obvious that the carnival is composed of a plurality of events, the adequacy of social discomfort and noise both have separate ratings according to the social reality of the time that the rules must be applied for, as the public prosecutor warns, not all such actions have the same capacity to undermine fundamental rights and therefore that in no way justifies the request for suspension of Carnival because of the violation of fundamental rights.\\" The order added that the neighbors broke the principle of good faith by failing to notify the Town Hall before the Carnival and submit a comprehensive plan, leaving the door open to further demands. That year a storm also struck Tenerife, delaying Carnival plans. This decision was appealed by the neighbors before the Board of Administrative Disputes Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Canarias (TSJC), which resolved the violation of fundamental rights by the Carnival of 2006 and 2007. In the legal basis of the fifth sentence, suspending the Carnival was not considered appropriate. However, the TSJC said \\"in no case\\" noise at night could exceed 55 decibels and that the City should take the necessary steps to control it while moving (if necessary) \\"the evening activities to residential areas\\". On Thursday, 8 February 2007, a judge of the Administrative Dispute No. 1 in the capital suspended night dances held in the center, as they violated the fundamental rights of neighbors. On Monday, 12 February 2007, after negotiation with both parties, the court declared inadmissible the suspension of acts of Carnival in the streets. The reason was that this was already resolved for 2007 by the 2006 ruling of the Chamber for Contentious Administrative Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Canarias. = 2007 Holiday Act = On 14 February 2007 the Parliament of the Canary Islands, in an extraordinary meeting, unanimously approved a new law lifting environmental-noise regulations during certain dates at the discretion of municipalities.

The event is usually broadcast to the entire country, and abroad by satellite. During the gala, the candidates parade across the main stage in their rich and beautiful costumes that might weigh up to 100 kilograms. A jury composed of members of the municipal corporation and celebrities chooses the queen; there is also a vote via SMS (short messaging service). After choosing the bridesmaids, the mayor hands the sceptre to the winner. Since the costumes are heavy, the candidates rely on wheeled transportation. The costumes are also expensive, so the candidates are sponsored (usually by a multinational corporation with a presence on the islands). The Hogar Canario Venezolano also sends its own Queen and holds a privileged position in the next Announcement Parade. Costumes are usually made of feathers, plastic, metal and paper. The queen is responsible for representing the carnival at tourism fairs as an ambassador for the Canary Islands. = Friday: Announcement Parade = On Friday the Announcement Parade is held, in which all participating groups march along the main thoroughfares of the city announcing the arrival of the carnival.

The men, including Poles and the Soviets (following Operation Barbarossa), were kept there usually for several days only. Many children belonged to slave labourers already deported to the Third Reich. The children underwent selection for Germanization before being sent to German families. Among those who were not selected death rate was very high. There were no medicines in the camp and no doctors. The food and water were rationed.

It faces the headquarters of La D√©fense and is aligned on the Axe historique of Paris. History Statue of Jean-Rodolphe Perronet The first bridge on the site was in wood, built after the fall of Henry IV and Marie de M√©dicis's carriage in June 1606. The second was a 219m-long five-arched structure built in 1774 by Jean-Rodolphe Perronet, founder of the √âcole des ponts et chauss√©es (a stone statue of him is now at the foot of the bridge, at the west point of the √éle de Puteaux). The second bridge was demolished between 1936 and 1942 and replaced in 1942 with a metal bridge by Louis-Alexandre L√©vy and the Dayd√© company. In 1992, its pedestrian sidewalks were narrowed to allow Line 1 to be added to the bridge and the bridge gave its name to the nearby M√©tro station. The present bridge effectively consisted of two bridges: a 67 metre span between Neuilly-sur-Seine and the √éle de Puteaux, as well as an 87 metre span between the √éle de Puteaux and Courbevoie.

Hampden is a working class neighborhood mostly known as the setting for many of John Waters's films about Baltimore. Meyer attended the Baltimore City Public Schools system, including Baltimore City College High School, until dropping out at age 16 and getting a GED. He spent the next five years working as a bicycle mechanic and occasionally volunteering at Baltimore's Shock Trauma Center. At age 20, while taking college classes in Baltimore, Meyer decided to become a writer. He also decided to leave his hometown and at 22, after several attempts at applying to elite colleges, was admitted to Cornell University. Cornell was a hugely positive experience for Meyer, who reflected that ‚ÄúAll of the sudden I wasn‚Äôt alone.\\" During his time at Cornell, Meyer wrote a 600-page novel that was never published, later dismissing it as \\"self- indulgent undergrad nonsense\\". Meyer graduated from Cornell with a degree in English and many years later received an MFA from the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas. Career Meyer worked as a first responder on and off for nearly fifteen years. In his early twenties he volunteered as an orderly at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in downtown Baltimore. He would later serve as a volunteer firefighter in fire departments outside Baltimore and in rural New York State. He was one of the first outside EMTs to respond to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans, driving his own vehicle there and arriving on the day of the storm. https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2005-09-02/288140/ Meyer also spent a few years working on Wall Street. After graduating from college, he took a job with the Swiss investment bank UBS as a derivatives trader. He describes his experience there as \\"soul crushing\\" but also maintained friendships with many of his old colleagues. After several years at UBS, Meyer committed to pursuing his dream of becoming a writer. He wrote a second novel that he could not get published, a book he has called \\"an apprentice-level work\\". He moved back into his parents' house in Baltimore, taking jobs driving an ambulance and as a construction worker. He was preparing for a long-term career as a paramedic when, in 2005, he received a fellowship at the Michener Center for Writers in Austin, Texas, where he wrote the majority of American Rust. Random House bought American Rust at the end of 2008. During his time at the Michener Center, Meyer met fellow writer Kevin Powers, who later wrote the 2012 Iraq War novel The Yellow Birds. In 2010, Meyer was named to The New Yorkers \\"20 under 40\\", its decennial list of 20 promising writers under the age of 40. In 2013, Meyer finished work on his novel The Son, and began developing it as a TV show, along with some University of Texas classmates. He co-founded a television production company, El Jefe, but it dissolved a few years later. In 2016, AMC picked up The Son as a television series starring Pierce Brosnan.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/arts/television/in-amcs-western- the-son-the-novelist-philipp-meyer-lassoes-tv.html In 2019, Showtime announced they were adapting Meyer's first novel into a show called Rust, starring Jeff Daniels https://deadline.com/2019/07/jeff-daniels-to-star-executive-produce- rust-drama-series-at-showtime-1202658070/ =American Rust= The bulk of American Rust was written during Meyer's time at the Michener Center (2005‚Äì2008). In December 2007 the novel was acquired by Spiegel & Grau, a Random House imprint. American Rust was eventually acquired by publishers in 23 countries and translated into 17 languages. It is a third person, stream- of-consciousness narrative influenced, according to Meyer, by writers such as James Joyce, William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, and James Kelman.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/books/review/philipp-meyer-by-the- book.html American Rust was a winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize (2009). Reviewers in the UK's The Daily Telegraphhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5361130/American- Rust-By-Philipp-Meyer-review.html, The Plain Dealerhttp://www.cleveland.com/books/index.ssf/2009/03/is_american_rust_the_new_great.html in Cleveland, and Dayton Daily Newshttp://www.mydaytondailynews.com/entertainment/how-can-philipp-meyer-top- american-rust/SV1sierTtbU2YWMLMBxUfO/ have suggested it fits the category of \\"Great American Novel\\". =The Son= Toward the end of composing American Rust, Meyer sought to find another subject through which he could explore what he felt was the \\"creation myth of America\\". Meyer's original vision for The Son was quite different from the final novel; it originally featured \\"six or seven characters‚Äù, was \\"set in the present day\\", and \\"was conceived [...] as a book about the rise of a family dynasty and America‚Äôs relationship with war and violence.\\" After two and a half years working on this version, Meyer realized that \\"these characters were talking about this legendary guy, and they were commenting on the American myth, in a way. And finally [...] it finally hit me that ... I needed the legendary character [Eli McCullough] in the book.\\" The inspiration for the revised novel grew out of recalling his time studying for his MFA at the University of Texas, during which Meyer became familiar with the so-called \\"Bandit War\\" of 1915‚Äì1918. He saw the potential for a novel concerning the Bandit Wars and the \\"creation myth of Texas\\" to explore broader historical issues about the development of America as a whole. After American Rusts publication, Meyer began to research Texas history more closely. Meyer has estimated that he read 350 or so books about the history of Texas and diverse topics from captivity narratives to guides on bird tracks in the course of his composition of the novel. To gather historically accurate material for the book, Meyer learned how to tan deer hides, taught himself how to hunt with a bow, spent a month with military contractor Blackwater for firearms training, and shot a buffalo at a ranch so he could drink its blood - giving him a reference point for Comanche rituals. With The Son, Meyer sought to write \\"[...] a modernist take on the American creation myth. I didn't want the characters to be mythological figures, the way they're presented to us as kids in movies and in some books.\\" The writing took five years. The Son was published in May 2013. It was described in press releases as \\"an epic of Texas\\", with the plot concerning \\"three generations of a Texas family: Eli, his son Pete and Pete‚Äôs daughter Jeanne. Each face their own challenges‚ÄîComanche raiders, border wars and a changing civilization, respectively.\\" Meyer has described the novel-in-progress as \\"[a] partly historical novel about the rise of an oil and ranching dynasty in Texas, tracing the family from the earliest days of white settlement, fifty years of open warfare with the Comanche, the end of the frontier and the rise of the cattle industry, and transitioning into the modern (oil) age. The rise of Texas as a power pretty closely parallels America's rise to global power, for obvious reasons. And I wanted to write about the parts of America that are growing, rather than declining.\\" Meyer has said that he has conceived The Son to be the second part of a trilogy of novels that began with American Rust. The Son was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and won the Lucien Barri√®re Prize in France as well as the Prix Litt√©rature-Monde in France. It was also long listed for the International Dublin Literary Award. =The City= Meyer's third novel will be published in 2021, according to sources online. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43309541-the-city Meyer intended The City to be a modern take on Dante's Divine Comedy, with elements of magical realism and science fiction. The book is structured similarly to The Son, with multiple points of view and interlocking stories.

Early life and education Dunlop was born in Ireland, lives in Bangkok, Thailand. He was educated in Ireland and later England (Bedales School). He studied at the Central School of Art and Design in London. CareerFilm director= Dunlop co-directed the HBO film Burma Soldier (with Anne Sundberg and Ricki Stern, produced by Julie le Brocquy). The film was awarded the \\"Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary\\" at the 2011 United Nations Association Film Festival, and Dunlop received a 2011 News & Documentary Emmy Award nomination for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievment in a Craft: Writing\\" for his writing. =Author and photographer= Dunlop co-authored War of the Mines (1994) with Paul Davies, about the devastation caused by landmines. His book The Lost Executioner: A Story of the Khmer Rouge (Bloomsbury, UK 2005; Walkerbooks, US 2006) was the result of a research supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism. Dunlop exposed Kaing Guek Eav a.k.a. Comrade Duch, the former head of Democratic Kampuchea's dreaded special branch: the Santebal. Duch disappeared after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. In 1999, Dunlop tracked Duch to Samlaut, Cambodia, where Duch had been transferred as Director of Education. Several months later, Nate Thayer, who had previously interviewed Pol Pot and Ta Mok, accompanied Dunlop where they interviewed Duch for the Far Eastern Economic Review. Duch surrendered to the authorities in Phnom Penh following the publication of his interview. (Photo reference Photo: Leaders/Kaing-Guek-Eav ). Duch was later tried and found guilty of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity becoming the first former Khmer Rouge to be tried and sentenced by the UN-backed tribunal in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Dunlop received an award from the Johns Hopkins University for Excellence in International Journalism for exposing Duch. Dunlop spent 20 years photographing Burma's military regime (1992-2012). His book, Brave New Burma, a portrait of the country in pictures and words, was published in 2013. He is currently working on a long-term project about the Battle of Aughrim (1691) in Galway, Ireland. A short version appeared in Granta magazine.

It is the third busiest station in Italy for passenger flow after Rome Termini and Milan Central, with about 192,000 journeys per day and 70 million travellers a year and a total of about 350 trains per day. Porta Nuova is a terminal station, with trains arriving perpendicularly to the facade. The station is located in Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, right in front of Piazza Carlo Felice (in the South side of the city centre). Trains between Turin and Milan start or finish at the station, including services using the Turin‚ÄìMilan high-speed line. A metro station, which is part of Turin Metro (Metropolitana di Torino) line 1, has been recently built under the station building. History Construction of the station began in 1861 under the direction of Alessandro Mazzucchetti. The original structure included a clear distinction between the departure area (near Via Nizza) and the arrival area (near Via Paolo Sacchi). The departure area consisted of a large saloon, decorated with columns, stucco work and frescoes depicting the crests of 135 Italian cities showing their distance in kilometers from Turin. This building housed the ticket office, three waiting rooms (one for each of the three classes of railway travel), the Royal Hall and a cafe restaurant. The station was first opened to the public in December 1864 - although the work was completed in 1868. There was no official opening ceremony at the time, partly because the capital of Italy had just been moved from Turin to Florence. An official opening ceremony inaugurating the station was performed on 4 February 2009. The name Porta Nuova (\\"New Gate\\" in English) refers to an old city gate once standing nearby, right along the South side of the old city walls, at the bottom of present-day Via Roma (once called Via Nuova): after the walls were torn down at the beginning of the 19th century, the gates themselves got demolished - a singular exception was Porta Palatina - but their old names kept being used as local place names (other examples are Porta Susa and Porta Palazzo). Enzo Ferrari attended \\"Bar del Nord\\" in Porta Nuova, where he met those connected with automobiles and racing when he was working in Turin as a young man, circa 1918‚Äì1919. A station of the Turin Metro (Metropolitana di Torino) opened under the main station on 5 October 2007. Upgrading Station facade, after renovationsThe station was included in a nationwide program of upgrades to the main Italian stations, by Grandi Stazioni, a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato. In the first stage of renovations completed on February 4, 2009, 44,146 square metres of the 92,747 square meter area of the station buildings was redeveloped. The areas allocated to services for passengers, dining, shopping, culture and leisure was increased considerably. In January 2013, restoration work continued on the facade and interior, preserving historical elements from the 19th century, including its distinctive, red colour, that hadn't been seen in generations. After nearly 4 years of work, scaffolding came down and the building was unveiled to the public, featuring a new, coloured LED lighting scheme. In December 2016, Unieuro, a large-scale electronics and domestic appliances retailer, opened a 1,400m2 location within the station. Work continues in 2017 on upgrades to the track area, including the addition of more fully accessible platforms. Structure The station is built on several levels. An underground level is occupied by local divisions of FS and businesses. The platforms are on the ground floor, along with passenger lounges and associated services for passengers and commercial activities. On the upper floors are offices and a post office. One corner of the Gonin Room =The Gonin Room= In a corridor off the central gallery of the station, a former first-class waiting room where members of the Royal Savoy family awaited their trains, is still visible today. Modest in size, at 75m2, the room is well preserved, featuring original furniture consisting of armchairs, tables, and mirrors. It is not open to the general public, except on special occasions. The room's name is derived from Francesco Gonin, the artist who painted its frescoes. The paintings, still well maintained, represent the elements of nature - Earth, Water, and Fire.

Released April 14, 1951, the cartoon was directed by Friz Freleng. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc. The Fair-Haired Hare was the first short released in which Yosemite Sam was drawn with his mouth in his red mustache for the entire film. It is also one of the few cartoons where Sam refers to Bugs by name, and is also one of the few where Sam actually attempts to save Bugs from danger as well (when he thinks the bearskin rug is attacking him, early on.) Plot Bugs Bunny‚Äîcontentedly singing \\"Home on the Range,\\" adding in that rabbits also live on the prairie‚Äîis startled after Yosemite Sam builds a cabin above his rabbit hole. Bugs tries to find out what's going on, interrupting Sam's banjo rendition of \\"I Can't Get Along, Little Dogie\\" (M.K. Jerome/Jack Scholl); Sam attributes this disturbance to mice. Bugs saws a hole and climbs out through a bearskin rug. Its mouth closes as Bugs is halfway out, causing the bunny to panic; Sam sees this and shoots the rug repeatedly (\\"Playin' possum for 20 years! That'll learn ya!\\"). The two then begin quarreling over who has rights to the property; Bugs claims he was there first and should live there undisturbed (\\"Oh, uh, there must be some mistake. You see, through some error you built your house on my property. I'm afraid I'll have to ask ya to move it, doc.\\"), while Sam isn't interested in listening to a rabbit's opinion (\\"What?! Ooh, listen, rabbit! Yosemite Sam never makes a mistake! Now get that flea-bitten carcass offin' my real estate! AND stay out!\\") Bugs decides this may be a civil matter and plans to go to \\"the highest court in the country\\"‚Äîwhich they do: It is literally the \\"highest court\\" in the land, the courthouse being atop a mountain [elevation: ]. There, the judge declares that both Bugs and Sam shall share the land equally ... \\"and in the event that one of you should pass on, the other shall inherit the entire property.\\" Sam chuckles evilly, making Bugs uneasy. The rest of the cartoon sees Sam trying to kill Bugs, but all of his schemes go awry: * That night, the two bunk in the same bedroom, their beds on opposite sides of a window. After Sam turns out the light (\\"Good night, varmint!\\", \\"Uh, good night.\\"), Sam tries sneaking over to Bugs' bed in the dark to klonk him on the head. Bugs turns on the light in time, causing Sam to make the hasty excuse, \\"Carpet keeps rolling up!\\" (he does this as he pretends to bang the floor). After turning off the light again (\\"Good night, critter!\\"), Sam makes a second attempt, and indeed someone does suffer a concussion‚ÄîSam, as Bugs has hit his antagonist on the head (\\"There, that oughta keep that carpet flat!\\", \\"Good night, varmint, critter!\\"). * At breakfast the next morning, Sam prepares glasses of carrot juice for himself and Bugs, and spikes Bugs' glass with an unnamed explosive poison (while Bugs is in the bathroom). However, Bugs is psychic and when they sit at the table with the drinks, he rotates it to trade the drug-laced drink with Sam's drink. When Sam rotates them back, Bugs challenges Sam to a makeshift game of roulette (\\"Round she goes! Where she stops, nobody knows!\\"). Sam loses his patience and orders Bugs to drink at gunpoint. Bugs finally does, and after Sam drinks his first, but nothing happens to Bugs, making Sam realize that he has consumed the poison-spiked drink, moments before he blasts off into the sky. Sam runs back and immediately chases Bugs back into his hole. He then realizes the only way to kill off the rabbit is to pack his hole with explosives. However, Bugs diverts the dynamite under the house foundation. Sam then lights the fuse, but realizes too late that his house is about to be blown up. In the end, Bugs watches from his unharmed hole as the cabin fly straight up into the air, much like how the cabin did in the tornado in the 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz. A dazed Sam stumbles out onto his house's front porch and, upon realizing his fate, remarks: \\"Well, whaddya know, I've got a cabin in the sky!\\", as his house continues to fly upward.

History ByBox' was founded in February 2000 with the acquisition of Logibag SAS by Stuart Miller. It then merged with Dynamid one year later on 1 February 2001, at which point business partners Stuart Miller and Dan Turner set about providing a logistics solution to answer the needs of a market shift towards distance retailing, primarily based upon the forecasted rise in internet shopping. It spent the next few years building an electronic dropbox network and establishing a dominant presence in the field service engineering market. In 2003, ByBox agreed to a five-year deal with Hays to provide it with 335 banks of electronic boxes. But only 12 weeks later Hays decided to break up the company. ByBox then acquired the Field Service division of Hays PLC; Hays had a network of 10,000 mechanical lockers in 500 locations. However, as ByBox did not have its own distribution network it negotiated a deal to use the Hays network for 12 weeks. ByBox then intended to get a distribution partner, but with 11 weeks to spare decided to set up their own distribution network to control consistency across the company, to do this they opened 9 distribution centres across the UK. In the few years following the acquisition of Field Service division of Hays, ByBox moved its national hub from Rugby to a new hub in Coventry, its Normanton DC to Doncaster as well as relocating other DCs to larger premises.

Before that, it had been fully abolished in 1979, and earlier, from 1905 the penal code had abolished capital punishment in peacetime. The last execution in peacetime was carried out on 25 February 1876, when Kristoffer Nilsen Grindalen was beheaded in L√∏ten, but several people, mainly Norwegians and Germans, were executed after the Second World War and the years of Nazi occupation; among them Vidkun Quisling. HistoryEarly use= In addition to the usual capital crimes of murder and treason, medieval Norwegian law demanded execution also of people who were found guilty of witchcraft. During the witch-hunting of the 16th and 17th centuries, 300 persons were burned. About a hundred of them were from the Vard√∏ area. Women in the north, especially in Finnmark, were at particular risk due to the clergy and authorities believing that the devil resided at the edge of the world. King Christian V's Norwegian Law of 1687 described several capital crimes. A law of 16 October 1697 increased the penalty for some murders by coupling torture with the executions. On the way to the execution site the convict would be pinched with red hot tongs, and a hand would be cut off prior to decapitation. In 1757, the last known execution for bestiality in Norway was carried out. =Modern use= Until the 19th century, l√®se majest√© could result in capital punishment. By 1815 the most inhumane forms of execution were abolished, and decapitation or shooting were the remaining authorised methods. Capital crimes were premeditated or otherwise heinous murders as well as treason. Norway abolished the death penalty for civilian crimes in 1905, but was retained for certain military crimes in wartime.\\"Norway, With No Death Penalty, Balks at Treaty to Ban It\\", LA Times During the Nazi occupation of Norway (1940-1945), capital punishment was introduced by Vidkun Quisling's regime in September 1942, and the first of a total of nineteen executions was carried out on 16 August 1943, when police officer Gunnar Eilifsen was executed for disobedience. Before this, German law had applied, and four hundred Norwegians had already been executed. In 1941, the Nygaardsvold's Cabinet exiled in London allowed for the death penalty after the war, and expanded its scope in 1942 to cover torture and murder. The legal purge that followed the occupation resulted in several death sentences, of which 37 people, 25 Norwegians and 12 Germans, were executed. The last execution took place on 27 August 1948, when Ragnar Skancke was put before a firing squad at Akershus Fortress. =European Convention on Human Rights= In 1988 Norway signed on to protocol 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights which bans the use of capital punishment in peacetime and ratified protocol 13 which bans all use of capital punishment whatsoever in 2005. Norway generally opposes capital punishment outside of the country as well. The government has banished Mullah Krekar from Norway, but has not sent him to Iraq due to the possibility of him being charged with capital crimes in his home county. In the Martine Vik Magnussen case, Norway has declined to cooperate with the Yemenese government unless a guarantee is made that the death penalty is off the table. =Constitutional prohibition= The Constitution of Norway was extensively amended in May 2014. The new article 93 in the constitution explicitly prohibits capital punishment (\\"Every person has the right to life. No one can be sentenced to death.\\") along with torture, inhumane or degrading punishments, and slavery, and compels the government to protect against these practices. Public opinion Opinion polls have showed that about 1 in 4 Norwegians support the death penalty, with the highest support among Progress Party voters, among whom the support, as expressed in a poll from 2010, is at 51 percent. Although Progress Party politicians like Ulf Erik Knudsen and Jan Blomseth have expressed support for the death penalty for egregious cases of rape and murder, the party's policy is opposed to the death penalty. An opinion poll taken after the 2011 Norway attacks showed that the opposition to the death penalty remained firmly entrenched, with 16 percent supporting and 68 percent opposed.

St Macarius as Metropolitan bishop of Corinth, was a mystic and spiritual writer who worked to revive and mostly sustain the Orthodox Church under Turkish rule. He is most famous for working with St. Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain in collecting and compiling the ascetic text of the Philokalia.A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West by Michael Walsh pg 378, Published by Liturgical Press, 2007 , 9780814631867 Prayer of the Heart With his friend St. Nicodemus, Makarios compiled the five tomes of the Philokalia that were first published in Venice in 1782. It was the publication of these sacred and spiritual texts that lead to a renewal of the hesychast movement within the Orthodox. Beauty shall save the World The term used Philokalia (love of the beautiful) for the texts, was to enshrine the history of the Jesus Prayer (the Prayer of the heart) and the spiritual practice of this is called Hesychasm. It is this love of beauty that revives and gives faith to the hopeless. The history of the prayer begins with its earliest fathers including St Anthony the Great and the text ends with St Gregory Palamas. The title conveys the contemplative tradition. In that it teaches understanding of the inner or mystical Kingdom of God within each person. The spirit of God is an ember, one must cultivate the ember into an open fire. This perpetual fire burns in the heart, in love for all things, which is to share in the energy of God, which is love. () It is within the Philokalia that one learns how to properly navigate through the passions and depravity of existence called the World. The object of contemplation being \\"the love of beauty\\" or infinite beauty which is God. For if existence was truly evil it could not contain nor express beauty. This expression conveys the truth about the divine (ascetic) life and purpose which the heart learns through practise of the Prayer. Which is called Hesychasm. God in his energies is love.

History In 1934, the B&O;'s eastbound train number 16 was named the Blue Ridge Limited and in 1937 its westbound counterpart, train 15 was also named the Blue Ridge Limited. With ridership dropping after World War II, the B&O; discontinued the Blue Ridge Limited on February 20, 1949. Schedule and equipment In the early years, the Blue Ridge Limiteds consist was consistent with a first-class train, including reclining seats in coaches, a sleeper and a lounge with sleeping accommodations. A diner car, added in Pittsburgh, served breakfast and lunch to passengers going west. It was steam-powered until well after World War II. The westbound Blue Ridge Limited left Washington a few hours ahead of the Shenandoah but had a slower schedule due to the numerous head-end cars it carried. The eastbound Blue Ridge Limiteds schedule was revised in 1938 so that it began in Pittsburgh, instead of Chicago, thus reducing the number of Chicago-Washington trains. A lounge car was added in 1945 between Washington and Akron to increase ridership, and in 1947 the lounge car was extended all the way to Chicago.

O. Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 129 is a noble title used to refer to the family of Dato' Pasir Raja and his descendants, which ruled the Muar fief, which was a part of the Johor Empire from the middle of the seventeenth century onwards. History During the mid-seventeenth century, the Sultan of Johor took the hand of Marhum Bakal, the sister of Bendahara Tun Habib Abdul Majid and Sayyid Ja'afar, the Dato' Pasir Raja. As a dowry, Dato' Pasir Raja was granted the fief of Muar. The first Raja Temenggung of Muar is Sa Akar di-Raja whose mausoleum is found Kampung Lubuk Batu, Segamat next to the mausoleum of Bendahara Tepok founder of Segamat; his descendants were similarly buried at Kampung Lubuk Batu.Waris Temenggong rayu pencen dikaji semula, Jamaludin Husin, 24 July 2008, Berita Harian The 7th Raja Temenggung, Engku Abdul Salleh, was buried in Pengkalan Kota, their administrative centre.Descendants of the eighth Temenggung, Jassmine Shadiqe, JohorBuzz, New Straits Times In the early nineteenth century, the fief was divided into eight hamlets, each ruled by a chieftain with the Raja Temengung of Muar as the head of the \\"federation\\". Muar was caught in a power grab by the Maharaja of Johor, Abu Bakar after its puppet ruler, Sultan Ali died. The British \\"offered\\" its good services to restore calm. Without the British pressure, recognition of Tengku Alam was a foregone conclusion. As the British sided with the Maharaja, the Raja Temenggung and the chieftains were captured and coerced into accepting the Maharaja's lordship.Abdullah Zakaria Ghazali, Istana dan Politik Johor (1835-1885), University Malaya Publication, 1996, pages 73-74 An election which at the suggestion of the British, was held in which the chieftains voted in favour of joining Johor, but Sultan Ali's son, Tengku Alam and the Muar Temenggung were indignant and made vociferous claims upon Muar (even though the Muar Temenggung later relented under heavy pressure).R. O. Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 131 ...The British Government decided to let the Temenggong and headmen of Muar elect their permanent ruler. In spite of the contention of Tengku 'Alam that Sultan 'Ali's family should be the electors, the British Government took the only course. Sultan 'Ali had been a ruler without a court. ... Continued claims by Tengku Alam and his supporters resulted in the outbreak of the Jementah Civil War the following year, in which the British forces (allied with the Maharaja) subdued Tengku Alam's supporters.R. O. Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 132 The Muar Temenggung was subsequently paid an annual stipend by the Maharaja (Sultan after 1885) as part of a settlement treaty made on 5 February 1879 with the annexation of the Muar fiefdom.

It is currently the only major Raku compiler in active development. Originally developed within the Parrot project, the Rakudo source code repository was split from the project in February 2009 so that it could be developed independently, although there were still many dependencies at the time. Rakudo is written in C, Raku, and the lightweight Raku subset \\"NQP\\" (Not Quite Perl). Rakudo Perl #14 was released in February 2009, codenamed Vienna after the Perl mongers group that had sponsored one of its developers since April 2008. Subsequent releases have used codenames based on Perl mongers groups. The first major release of a distribution of both compiler and modules (named \\"Rakudo *\\" or \\"Rakudo Star\\") was on July 29, 2010.  Name  The name \\"Rakudo\\" for the Raku compiler was first suggested by Damian Conway. \\"Rakudo\\" is short for \\"Rakuda-d≈ç\\" (with a long 'o'; Èß±ÈßùÈÅì), which is Japanese for \\"Way of the Camel\\". \\"Rakudo\\" (with a short 'o'; Ê•ΩÂúü) also means \\"paradise\\" in Japanese.
