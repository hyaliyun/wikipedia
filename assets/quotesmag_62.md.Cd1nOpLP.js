The band is the brainchild of singer/guitarist JF Coley, joined by Jocelyn Blanchette on the drums and David Jalbert on bass. Their musical style has been referred to as a \\"post-grunge throwback to British 60's pop\\". Their latest album, Crossing the Rubicon, discusses political and social issues facing the Eastern Townships of Quebec and its community. History Coley Live, 2006 Coming from a musical family, JF started performing at age 3, in a violin ensemble. After graduating from Mount Allison University (where JF was in a band, Smiling Politely, composed of future members of In-Flight Safety) JF was recruited by Sarnia, Ontario band Flicker. Over the next year, JF would perform with some of Canada's top bands, like Our Lady Peace, Nickelback, The Guess Who, Treble Charger, etc... After Canadian Music Week 2003, JF returned to the Eastern Townships where he would now base his operations. Aware that the Quebec sovereignty movement had negatively affected the Eastern Townships (where the culture had always celebrated a happy coexistence between Francophones and anglophones), JF started working with CJMQ-FM to promote the local culture and celebrate a unique region of North America. In late 2003, JF went to Los Angeles to record his first album, Extended Play, with producer Mike Krompass. The album was a small collection of songs, and was released under JF Coley. A band was put together to tour the album, composed of Jocelyn Blanchette on drums and Sebastien Simard on bass. The band performed around the Eastern Townships and Ontario with such bands as April Wine and the Trews. In 2005 a new bass player joined the fold, Neal Gupta, a Montreal-based bass player. JF had already started work on a new album, Crossing the Rubicon, with Canadian producer Jordon Zadorozny (whose previous collaborations include Sam Roberts, Lindsey Buckingham, Courtney Love, and Billy Corgan). The album was produced at Studio French Kiss in Pembroke, Ontario. The album had a limited release in the summer of 2006, and the band toured Quebec and Ontario over two weeks with August and Wellabee. The band lost their bass player to work, which slowed down the touring. They still managed a show for the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope, and two shows in the US in Boston and New York City. The album has been spun across Canada, on campus radio stations and independent commercial stations. In the spring of 2007 the band added David Jalbert as a new bass player and are now ready to hit the road again in the summer.

Headed by lawyer Tunji Braithwaite, known for his opposition and as a lawyer, the party was the only new political organization allowed to field candidates for the 1983 elections. The party was composed of southern Nigerian intellectuals favoring a reformist government. History The party was launched on 13 October 1978 in Ibadan. Party leaders initially took a cautious attitude towards the idea of free education, but later advocated free university education and mandatory primary education. It positioned itself as an alternative to the old politicians of the first republic. In its first two decades, Nigeria witnessed extensive military rule. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was the last military head of state prior to the 1983 elections. Tunji Braithwaite was a prominent Lagosian who claimed that Nigeria's potential could be achieved by reform‚Äîespecially through the eradication of deep-rooted corruption. Notable associates of Tunji Braithwaite include Wole Soyinka, Nobel Peace Prize Winner, and musician Fela Anikulapo Kuti, whose mother was murdered by soldiers in a raid on Fela's Kalakuta Republic under Obasanjo's Military Regime. Campaign In December 1978, three political pressure groups joined the party. They were the Nigeria Tenants and Labour Congress, headed by I.H. Igali, the Nigeria Social Democratic Congress, led by Balali Dauda, and the Youth Force Alliance, led by Olayinka Olabiwonu.

Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain, and he served as the first vice president of the United States. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams and Thomas Jefferson. A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States' own constitution, as did his earlier Thoughts on Government. Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. He was the only president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared \\"Quasi-War\\" with France. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House. In his bid for reelection, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend Thomas Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family, which includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on July 4, 1826 ‚Äì the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence ‚Äì hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have favorably ranked his administration. Early life and education=Childhood= Adams's birthplace now in alt=Small wooden house with red- brick chimney in the middle John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735, Old Style, Julian calendar), to John Adams Sr. and Susanna Boylston. He had two younger brothers, Peter (1738-1823) and Elihu (1741-1775). Adams was born on the family farm in Braintree, Massachusetts. His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day Brookline, Massachusetts. His father was a deacon in the Congregational Church, a farmer, a cordwainer, and a lieutenant in the militia. John Sr. served as a selectman (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship. Adams's great-great-grandfather Henry Adams immigrated to Massachusetts from Braintree, Essex, England, around 1638. Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His was a family of Puritans, who profoundly affected their region's culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams's birth, Puritan tenets such as predestination had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still \\"considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency.\\" Adams recalled that his parents \\"held every Species of Libertinage in ... Contempt and horror,\\" and detailed \\"pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin\\" resulting from any debauchery. Adams later noted that \\"As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men ‚Äì that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her children.\\" Adams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a dame school for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centered upon The New England Primer. Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included Latin, rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams's early education included incidents of truancy, a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that he remain in school: \\"You shall comply with my desires.\\" Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively. =College education and adulthood= At age sixteen, Adams entered Harvard College in 1751, studying under Joseph Mayhew. As an adult, Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as Thucydides, Plato, Cicero, and Tacitus in their original languages. Though his father expected him to be a minister, after his 1755 graduation with an A.B. degree, he taught school temporarily in Worcester, while pondering his permanent vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving \\"Honour or Reputation\\" and \\"more from [his] fellows\\", and was determined to be \\"a great Man.\\" He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers \\"noble and gallant achievements\\" but, among the clergy, the \\"pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces.\\" His aspirations conflicted with his Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described \\"trumpery\\" and failure to share the \\"happiness of [his] fellow men.\\" As the French and Indian War began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his responsibility in the conflict as many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, \\"I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer,\\" recognizing that he was the first of his family to \\"[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia.\\" =Law practice and marriage= In 1756, Adams began reading law under James Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he earned an A.M. from Harvard, and in 1759 was admitted to the bar. He developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary; this included James Otis Jr.'s 1761 legal argument challenging the legality of British writs of assistance, allowing the British to search a home without notice or reason. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies. A group of Boston businessmen had been appalled at the writs of assistance that the crown had started issuing to clamp down on colonial smuggling. Writs of assistance were not only search warrants without any limits, they also required local sheriffs, and even local citizens, to assist in breaking into colonists' houses or lend whatever assistance customs officials desired.Sabine, Lorenzo. The American Loyalists, pp. 328‚Äì9, Charles C. Little and James Brown, Boston, Massachusetts, 1847.Smith, M. H.

Origins of the American Revolution, pp 46-7, Little, Brown & Company, Boston, Massachusetts, 1943. The outraged businessmen engaged lawyer James Otis Jr. to challenge writs of assistance in court. Otis gave the speech of his life, making references to the Magna Carta, classical allusions, natural law, and the colonists‚Äô ‚Äúrights as Englishmen.‚ÄùMonk, Linda R. The Words We Live By, p 158, Hyperion, New York, New York, 2003. .Nash, Gary B. The Unknown American Revolution, pp 21-23, Viking, New York, New York, 2005. . The court ruled against the merchants. However, the case lit the fire that became the American Revolution. Otis‚Äôs arguments were published in the colonies, and stirred widespread support for colonial rights. As a young lawyer, John Adams was observing the case in the packed courtroom, and was moved by Otis‚Äôs performance and legal arguments. Adams later said that ‚ÄúThen and there the child Independence was born.‚ÄùMonk, Linda R. The Words We Live By, p 158, Hyperion, New York, New York, 2003. .Burns, Eric. Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism, pp 141-2, 201, Public Affairs, New York, New York, 2006. . In 1763, Adams explored various aspects of political theory in seven essays written for Boston newspapers. He offered them anonymously, under the nom de plume \\"Humphrey Ploughjogger\\", and in them ridiculed the selfish thirst for power he perceived among the Massachusetts colonial elite. Adams was initially less well known than his older cousin Samuel Adams, but his influence emerged from his work as a constitutional lawyer, his analysis of history, and his dedication to republicanism. Adams often found his own irascible nature a constraint in his political career. In the late 1750s, Adams fell in love with Hannah Quincy; while they were alone, he was poised to propose but was interrupted by friends, and the moment was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old Abigail Smith, his third cousin, through his friend Richard Cranch, who was courting Abigail's older sister. Adams initially was not impressed with Abigail and her two sisters, writing that they were not \\"fond, nor frank, nor candid.\\" In time, he grew close to Abigail and they were married on October 25, 1764, despite the opposition of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared a love of books and kindred personalities that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other. After his father's death in 1761, Adams had inherited a farm and a house where they lived until 1783. John and Abigail had six children: Abigail \\"Nabby\\" in 1765, future president John Quincy Adams in 1767, Susanna in 1768, Charles in 1770, Thomas in 1772, and Elizabeth in 1777. Susanna died when she was one year old, while Elizabeth was stillborn. All three of his sons became lawyers. Charles and Thomas were unsuccessful, became alcoholics, and died before old age, while John Quincy excelled and launched a career in politics. Adams's writings are devoid of his feelings about the sons' fates. Career before the Revolution=Opponent of Stamp Act= Adams rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765. The Act was imposed by the British Parliament without consulting the American legislatures. It required payment of a direct tax by the colonies for stamped documents, and was designed to pay for the costs of Britain's war with France. Power of enforcement was given to British vice admiralty courts, rather than common law courts. These Admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked. The Act was despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent, and encountered violent resistance, preventing its enforcement. Adams authored the \\"Braintree Instructions\\" in 1765, in the form of a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature. In it, he explained that the Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for other towns' instructions. Adams also reprised his pen name \\"Humphrey Ploughjogger\\" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of that year. Included were four articles to the Boston Gazette. The articles were republished in The London Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America, also known as A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law. He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament. He noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister Jonathan Mayhew, invoking Romans 13 to justify insurrection. While Adams took a strong stand against the Act in writing, he rebuffed attempts by Samuel Adams, a leader in the popular protest movements, to involve him in mob actions and public demonstrations. In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected Adams as a selectman. With the repeal of the Stamp Act in early 1766, tensions with Britain temporarily eased. Putting politics aside, Adams moved his family to Boston in April 1768 to focus on his law practice. The family rented a clapboard house on Brattle Street that was known locally as the \\"White House\\". He, Abigail, and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still, later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city. With the death of Jeremiah Gridley and mental collapse of Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer. =Counsel for the British: Boston Massacre= alt=Depiction of chaotic confrontation between British soldiers and Bostonians Britain's passage of the Townshend Acts in 1767 revived tensions, and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more troops to the colonies. On March 5, 1770, when a lone British sentry was accosted by a mob of citizens, eight of his fellow soldiers reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones, and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians, bringing about the infamous Boston Massacre. The accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do so despite the risk to his reputation ‚Äì he believed no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were delayed so that passions could cool. The week-long trial of the commander, Captain Thomas Preston, began on October 24 and ended in his acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire. The remaining soldiers were tried in December when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions: \\"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\\" He added, \\"It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever.\\" Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients. According to biographer John E. Ferling, during jury selection Adams \\"expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles.\\" While Adams's defence was helped by a weak prosecution, he also \\"performed brilliantly.\\" Ferling surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy. The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, \\"Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning ‚Äì I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else.\\" After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and \\"vulgar\\" Braintree as a home for his family ‚Äì in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home. =Becoming a revolutionary= Adams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with the ultimate view of remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative. His ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor Thomas Hutchinson and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the Gazette that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and Joseph Hawley drafted a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their allegiance, was exclusive to the King. The Boston Tea Party, a historic demonstration against the British East India Company's tea monopoly over American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner Dartmouth, loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new Tea Act, had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the work of the protesters was done ‚Äì they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds, the 1992 equivalent of about $1 million. The Dartmouth owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed shipment. Adams himself applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the \\"grandest Event\\" in the history of the colonial protest movement, and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an \\"absolutely and indispensably\\" necessary action. Continental Congress=Member of Continental Congress= alt=56 figures stand or sit in a room. Five lay papers on a table. In 1774, at the instigation of John's cousin Samuel Adams, the First Continental Congress was convened in response to the Intolerable Acts, a series of deeply unpopular measures intended to punish Massachusetts, centralize authority in Britain, and prevent rebellion in other colonies. Four delegates were chosen by the Massachusetts legislature, including John Adams, who agreed to attend, despite an emotional plea from his friend Attorney General Jonathan Sewall not to. Shortly after he arrived in Philadelphia, Adams was placed on the 23-member Grand Committee tasked with drafting a letter of grievances to King George III. The members of the committee soon split into conservative and radical factions. Although the Massachusetts delegation was largely passive, Adams criticized conservatives such as Joseph Galloway, James Duane, and Peter Oliver who advocated a conciliatory policy towards the British or felt that the colonies had a duty to remain loyal to Britain, although his views at the time did align with those of conservative John Dickinson. Adams sought the repeal of objectionable policies, but at this early stage he continued to see benefits in maintaining the ties with Britain. He renewed his push for the right to a jury trial.Elrod, Jennifer. \\"W(h)ither the Jury? The Diminishing Role of the Jury Trial in Our Legal System,\\" 68 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 3, 8 (2011) (quoting Thomas J. Methvin, Alabama ‚Äì The Arbitration State, 62 Ala. Law. 48, 49 (2001)). He complained of what he considered the pretentiousness of the other delegates, writing to Abigail, \\"I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative.\\" Adams ultimately helped engineer a compromise between the conservatives and the radicals. The Congress disbanded in October after sending the final petition to the King and showing its displeasure with the Intolerable Acts by endorsing the Suffolk Resolves.\\"The First Continental Congress,\\"John Adams Historical Society, accessed 2016. Adams's absence from home was hard on Abigail, who was left alone to care for the family. She still encouraged her husband in his task, writing: \\"You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together.\\" News of the opening hostilities with the British at the Battles of Lexington and Concord made Adams hope that independence would soon become a reality. Three days after the battle, he rode into a militia camp and, while reflecting positively on the high spirits of the men, was distressed by their poor condition and lack of discipline. A month later, Adams returned to Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress as the leader of the Massachusetts delegation. He moved cautiously at first, noting that the Congress was divided between Loyalists, those favoring independence, and those hesitant to take any position. He became convinced that Congress was moving in the proper direction ‚Äì away from Great Britain. Publicly, Adams supported \\"reconciliation if practicable,\\" but privately agreed with Benjamin Franklin's confidential observation that independence was inevitable. In June 1775, with a view of promoting union among the colonies against Great Britain, he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the army then assembled around Boston. He praised Washington's \\"skill and experience\\" as well as his \\"excellent universal character.\\" Adams opposed various attempts, including the Olive Branch Petition, aimed at trying to find peace between the colonies and Great Britain. Invoking the already-long list of British actions against the colonies, he wrote, \\"In my opinion Powder and Artillery are the most efficacious, Sure, and infallibly conciliatory Measures We can adopt.\\" After his failure to prevent the petition from being enacted, he wrote a private letter derisively referring to Dickinson as a \\"piddling genius.\\" The letter was intercepted and published in Loyalist newspapers. The well-respected Dickinson refused to greet Adams and he was for a time largely ostracized. Ferling writes, \\"By the fall of 1775 no one in Congress labored more ardently than Adams to hasten the day when America would be separate from Great Britain.\\" In October 1775, Adams was appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court, but he never served, and resigned in February 1777. In response to queries from other delegates, Adams wrote the 1776 pamphlet Thoughts on Government, which laid out an influential framework for republican constitutions. =Independence= Throughout the first half of 1776, Adams grew increasingly impatient with what he perceived to be the slow pace of declaring independence. He kept busy on the floor of the Congress, helping push through a plan to outfit armed ships to launch raids on enemy vessels. Later in the year, he drafted the first set of regulations to govern the provisional navy. Adams drafted the preamble to the Lee resolution of colleague Richard Henry Lee. He developed a rapport with Delegate Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, who had been slower to support independence but by early 1776 agreed that it was necessary. On June 7, 1776, Adams seconded the Lee resolution, which stated, \\"These colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states.\\" Independence Hall, where the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence Prior to independence being declared, Adams organized and selected a Committee of Five charged with drafting a Declaration of Independence. He chose himself, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. Jefferson thought Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson. Many years later, Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson: Jefferson asked, \\"Why will you not? You ought to do it.\\" To which Adams responded, \\"I will not ‚Äì reasons enough.\\" Jefferson replied, \\"What can be your reasons?\\" and Adams responded, \\"Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can.\\" \\"Well,\\" said Jefferson, \\"if you are decided, I will do as well as I can.\\" The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself remains uncertain. Accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are often contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a major role in its completion. On July 1, the resolution was debated in Congress. It was expected to pass, but opponents such as Dickinson made a strong effort to oppose it anyhow. Jefferson, a poor debater, remained silent while Adams argued for its adoption. Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as \\"the pillar of [the Declaration's] support on the floor of Congress, [its] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered.\\"Jefferson, Thomas. To William P. Gardner. The Works of Thomas Jefferson. Federal Edition (New York and London, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904‚Äì05). Vol. 11. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 2. Twelve colonies voted in the affirmative, while New York abstained. Dickinson was absent. On July 3, Adams wrote to Abigail that \\"yesterday was decided the greatest question which was ever debated in America, and a greater perhaps never was nor will be decided among men.\\" He predicted that \\"[t]he second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America,\\" and would be commemorated annually with great festivities. During the congress, Adams sat on ninety committees, chairing twenty-five, an unmatched workload among the congressmen. As Benjamin Rush reported, he was acknowledged \\"to be the first man in the House.\\" In June, Adams became head of the Board of War and Ordnance, charged with keeping an accurate record of the officers in the army and their ranks, the disposition of troops throughout the colonies, and ammunition. He was referred to as a \\"one man war department,\\" working up to eighteen-hour days and mastering the details of raising, equipping and fielding an army under civilian control. As chairman of the Board, Adams functioned as a de facto Secretary of War. He kept extensive correspondences with a wide range of Continental Army officers concerning supplies, munitions, and tactics. Adams emphasized to them the role of discipline in keeping an army orderly. He also authored the \\"Plan of Treaties,\\" laying out the Congress's requirements for a treaty with France. He was worn out by the rigor of his duties and longed to return home. His finances were unsteady, and the money that he received as a delegate failed even to cover his own necessary expenses. However, the crisis caused by the defeat of the American soldiers kept him at his post. After defeating the Continental Army at the Battle of Long Island on August 27, British Admiral Richard Howe determined that a strategic advantage was at hand, and requested that Congress send representatives to negotiate peace. A delegation consisting of Adams, Franklin, and Edward Rutledge met with Howe at the Staten Island Peace Conference on September 11. Howe's authority was premised on the states' submission, so the parties found no common ground. When Lord Howe stated he could only view the American delegates as British subjects, Adams replied, \\"Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ... except that of a British subject.\\" Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority. Adams was unimpressed with Howe and predicted American success. He was able to return home to Braintree in October before leaving in January 1777 to resume his duties in Congress. Diplomatic service=Commissioner to France= Before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary to establish trade, and conversely, trade was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with France. He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, Benjamin Harrison of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, \\"to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers.\\" While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the Model Treaty. The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty adhered to the provision that \\"free ships make free goods,\\" allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had defeated General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at Saratoga was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance. In November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing Silas Deane and joining Franklin and Arthur Lee in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. James Lovell invoked Adams's \\"inflexible integrity\\" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he \\"should have wanted no motives or arguments\\" for his acceptance if he \\"could be sure that the public would be benefited by it.\\" Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was \\"of inestimable value\\" to his maturation. On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the frigate Boston, commanded by Captain Samuel Tucker. The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction killed one of the crew and injured five others. On April 1, the Boston arrived in France, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an alliance with the United States on February 6. Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French. He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-keeping. Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister Vergennes in December, arguing for French naval support in North America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it. In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him minister plenipotentiary to France while Lee was sent to Spain. Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779. On August 2, they arrived in Braintree. Adams frequently clashed with Benjamin Franklin over how to manage French relations. In late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war. Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November aboard the French frigate Sensible ‚Äì accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles. A leak in the ship forced it to land in Ferrol, Spain, and Adams and his party spent six weeks travelling overland until they reached Paris. Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing to Abigail about once every ten days. In contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands \\"above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water.\\" In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to \\"retrace its steps.\\" Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied but voicing other grievances he had with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the comte de Rochambeau had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams. Adams then left France of his own accord. =Ambassador to the Dutch Republic= In mid-1780, Adams traveled to the Dutch Republic. One of the few other existing republics at the time, Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status, but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in Amsterdam in August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships, which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats. After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam \\"the capital of the reign of Mammon.\\" He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to the Dutch government at The Hague on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting the United States. In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went with Adams's secretary Francis Dana to Saint Petersburg as a French interpreter, in an effort to seek recognition from Russia, and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams's friend Benjamin Waterhouse. In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in \\"a major nervous breakdown.\\" That November, he learned that American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at Yorktown. The victory was in large part due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams's stand for increased naval assistance. News of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams arrived at The Hague to demand that the States General of the Netherlands answer his petitions. His efforts stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence and acknowledged Adams as ambassador. On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch Patriotten leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders. In October, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce. The house that Adams bought during this stay in the Netherlands became the first American embassy on foreign soil. =Treaty of Paris= Treaty of Paris by Benjamin West (Adams in front). After negotiating the loan with the Dutch, Adams was re-appointed as the American commissioner to negotiate the war-ending treaty, the Treaty of Paris. Vergennes and France's minister to the United States, Anne-C√©sar de La Luzerne, disapproved of Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, and Henry Laurens were appointed to collaborate with Adams, although Jefferson did not initially go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic following his imprisonment in the Tower of London.Ferling, ch. 11‚Äì12. In the final negotiations, securing fishing rights off Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island proved both very important and very difficult. In response to very strict restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland. This, and other statements, prompted Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to \\"sustain [these] pretentious ambitions.\\" Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France, instead dealing directly with the British. During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778 and that accepting would foster goodwill between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France. Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterward. Vergennes was angered when he learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation, and was supposedly surprised at how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for Gibraltar might have caused significant problems. On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was recognized. =Ambassador to Great Britain= Adams was appointed the first American ambassador to Great Britain in 1785. When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, \\"Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American.\\" Adams ‚Äì 1785 Mather Brown Portrait After arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with King George III on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality \\"between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood,\\" and the King agreed to \\"receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States.\\" The King added that although \\"he had been the last to consent\\" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that \\"There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France.\\" Adams replied, \\"That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country.\\" To this King George responded, \\"An honest Man will never have any other.\\" Adams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out Richard Price, minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church and instigator of the debate over the Revolution within Britain. Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at Harvard, cautioning the former against the \\"smell of the midnight lamp\\" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study. Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites. While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador: Adams's tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations. The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams's attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home. The news he received of tumult at home, such as Shays' Rebellion, heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved; in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same. Adams then went to The Hague to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans. Vice presidency, 1789‚Äì1797=Election= On June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in the months after. The nation's first presidential election was soon to take place. Because George Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go to a northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender. Each state's presidential electors gathered on February 4, 1789, to cast their two votes for the president. The person with the most votes would be president and the second would become vice president. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the election, second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became its first vice president. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes. In an effort to ensure that Adams did not accidentally become president and that Washington would have an overwhelming victory, Alexander Hamilton convinced at least 7 of the 69 electors to not cast their vote for Adams. After finding out about the manipulation but not Hamilton's role in it, Adams wrote to Benjamin Rush asking whether \\"Is not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a blessing?\\" Although his term started on March 4, 1789, Adams did not begin serving as Vice President of the United States until April 21, because he did not arrive in New York in time. =Tenure= Portrait of Adams by John Trumbull, 1793 The sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the Senate, where he can cast a tie-breaking vote. Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as \\"George Washington, President of the United States\\", the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties) for the president. Some senators favored a variant of Highness or the lesser Excellency.\\" Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as \\"superlatively ridiculous.\\" They argued that these \\"distinctions,\\" as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's prohibition on titles of nobility. Adams said that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with \\"dignity and splendor\\" to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. \\"For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair,\\" wrote Senator William Maclay of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams's fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private. He likened Adams to \\"a monkey just put into breeches.\\" Ralph Izard suggested that Adams be referred to by the title \\"His Rotundity,\\" a joke which soon became popular. On May 14, the Senate decided that the title of \\"Mr. President\\" would be used. Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the sentiment of the people. Washington quietly expressed his displeasure with the fuss and rarely consulted Adams. Portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, 1795. Washington rarely consulted Vice President Adams, who often felt marginalized and overshadowed by Washington's prestige. As vice president, Adams largely sided with the Washington administration and the emerging Federalist Party. He supported Washington's policies against opposition from anti-Federalists and Republicans. He cast 31 tie-breaking votes, all in support of the administration, and more than any other vice president. He voted against a bill sponsored by Maclay that would have required Senate consent for the removal of executive branch officials who had been confirmed by the Senate. In 1790, Jefferson, James Madison, and Hamilton struck a bargain guaranteeing Republican support for Hamilton's debt assumption plan in exchange for the capital being temporarily moved from New York to Philadelphia, and then to a permanent site on the Potomac River to placate Southerners. In the Senate, Adams cast a tie-breaking vote against a last-minute motion to keep the capital in New York. Adams played a minor role in politics as vice president. He attended few cabinet meetings, and the president sought his counsel infrequently. While Adams brought energy and dedication to the office, by mid-1789 he had already found it \\"not quite adapted to my character ... too inactive, and mechanical.\\" He wrote, \\"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.\\"Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 19 December 1793, website of the Massachusetts Historical Society (retrieved September 1, 2020). Adams's behavior made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, he grew accustomed to assuming a marginal role, and rarely intervened in debate. Adams never questioned Washington's courage or patriotism, but Washington did join Franklin and others as the object of Adams's ire or envy. \\"The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie,\\" Adams declared. \\"... The essence of the whole will be that Dr. Franklin's electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him with his Rod ‚Äì and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War.\\" Adams won reelection with little difficulty in 1792 with 77 votes. His strongest challenger, George Clinton, had 50. On July 14, 1789, the French Revolution began. Republicans were jubilant. Adams at first expressed cautious optimism, but soon began denouncing the revolutionaries as barbarous and tyrannical. Washington eventually consulted Adams more often, but not until near the end of his administration, by which point distinguished cabinet members Hamilton, Jefferson, and Edmund Randolph had all resigned. The British had been raiding American trading vessels, and John Jay was sent to London to negotiate an end to hostilities. When he returned in 1795 with a peace treaty on terms unfavorable to the United States, Adams urged Washington to sign it to prevent war. Washington chose to do so, igniting protests and riots. He was accused of surrendering American honor to a tyrannical monarchy and of turning his back on the French Republic. John Adams predicted in a letter to Abigail that ratification would deeply divide the nation. =Election of 1796= 1796 presidential election results The election of 1796 was the first contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously but, during his presidency, deep philosophical differences between the two leading figures in the administration ‚Äì Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson ‚Äì had caused a rift, leading to the founding of the Federalist and Republican parties. When Washington announced that he would not be a candidate for a third term, an intense partisan struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began. Like the previous two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then choose a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear Republican favorite was Jefferson. Adams was the Federalist frontrunner. The Republicans held a congressional nominating caucus and named Jefferson and Aaron Burr as their presidential choices. Jefferson at first declined the nomination, but he agreed to run a few weeks later. Federalist members of Congress held an informal nominating caucus and named Adams and Thomas Pinckney as their candidates. The campaign was, for the most part, confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets, and political rallies; of the four contenders, only Burr actively campaigned. The practice of not campaigning for office would remain for many decades. Adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called the \\"silly and wicked game\\" of electioneering. As the campaign progressed, fears grew among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions. Indeed, Adams felt largely left out of Washington's administration and did not consider himself a strong member of the Federalist Party. He had remarked that Hamilton's economic program, centered around banks, would \\"swindle\\" the poor and unleash the \\"gangrene of avarice.\\" Desiring \\"a more pliant president than Adams,\\" Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for \\"favorite son\\" Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone when several New England state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for Pinckney. Adams wrote shortly after the election that Hamilton was a \\"proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know.\\" Throughout his life, Adams made highly critical statements about Hamilton. He made derogatory references to his womanizing, real or alleged, and slurred him as the \\"Creole bastard.\\" In the end, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30. The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among nine other candidates. This is the only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets. Presidency, 1797‚Äì1801 President's House, Philadelphia. Adams occupied this Philadelphia mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. =Inauguration= Adams was sworn into office as the nation's second president on March 4, 1797, by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. As president, he followed Washington's lead in using the presidency to exemplify republican values and civic virtue, and his service was free of scandal. Adams spent much of his term at his Massachusetts home Peacefield, preferring the quietness of domestic life to business at the capital. He ignored the political patronage and office seekers which other office holders utilized. Historians debate his decision to retain the members of Washington's cabinet in light of the cabinet's loyalty to Hamilton. The \\"Hamiltonians who surround him,\\" Jefferson soon remarked, \\"are only a little less hostile to him than to me.\\" Although aware of Hamilton's influence, Adams was convinced that their retention ensured a smoother succession. Adams maintained the economic programs of Hamilton, who regularly consulted with key cabinet members, especially the powerful Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott Jr. Adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet, often making decisions despite opposition from it. Hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by Washington. Shortly after Adams was inaugurated, Hamilton sent him a detailed letter filled with policy suggestions for the new administration. Adams dismissively ignored it. =Failed peace commission and XYZ affair= A political cartoon depicts the XYZ Affair ‚Äì America is a female being plundered by Frenchmen. (1798) Historian Joseph Ellis writes that \\"[t]he Adams presidency was destined to be dominated by a single question of American policy to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding occupant of the office.\\" That question was whether to make war with France or find peace. In Europe, Britain and France were at war as a result of the French Revolution. Hamilton and the Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France. The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss. When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war. Because of the Jay Treaty, the French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy, and would not tolerate war with France. On May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France. He announced that he would send a peace commission to France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat. The speech was well received by the Federalists. Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and the \\"emblems of defense\\" in the other. The Republicans were outraged, for Adams had not only failed to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it. Sentiments changed with the XYZ Affair. The peace commission that Adams appointed consisted of John Marshall, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. Jefferson met four times with Joseph Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia. Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but \\"then drag out the negotiations at length\\" to arrive at most favorable solution. According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams \\"vain, suspicious, and stubborn.\\" When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. The diplomats were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents. The French emissaries (later code- named, X, Y, and Z) refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to France by Adams in his speech.[This is an Early Access document from The Adams Papers. It is not an authoritative final version.]. Also available via Internet Archive as archived on December 24, 2019. . The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained. News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in the form of a memorandum from Marshall on March 4, 1798. Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details. He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, Republicans in the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were \\"struck dumb.\\" Benjamin Franklin Bache, editor of the Philadelphia Aurora, blamed Adams's aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French. =Alien and Sedition Acts= Despite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were signed by Adams in June 1798. Congress specifically passed four measures ‚Äì the Naturalization Act, the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an \\"unguarded passion.\\" The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the president greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish \\"false, scandalous, and malicious writing\\" against the government or its officials. Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law. Thomas Jefferson, Adams's vice president, attempted to undermine many of his actions as president and eventually defeated him for reelection. The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists. Congressman Matthew Lyon of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the president. Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment. Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the \\"natural right\\" to nullify any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to \\"sever ourselves from the union we so much value.\\" Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists. =Quasi-War= In May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the Quasi-War. Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests. In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other \\"High Federalists\\" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a \\"provisional\\" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams's requests but fell short of Hamilton's. Adams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army. Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command without consulting him. Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates. He wished to have Henry Knox as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney. On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command. Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to Mount Vernon to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers. Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and Frederick Muhlenberg to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists. Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams. Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command. Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow Federalists. The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration. Alexander Hamilton's desire for high military rank and his push for war with France put him into conflict with Adams. It quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's de facto commander. He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army. Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding six fast, powerful frigates, most notably the USS Constitution. The Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the Battle of the Nile, which many Americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate. In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans. Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would combine to seize Spanish Florida and Louisiana, ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator. On February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a \\"master stroke.\\" To placate Republicans, he nominated Patrick Henry and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose William Richardson Davie to replace him. Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams's cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them. To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months ‚Äì March to September ‚Äì of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the yellow fever epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France. Adams arrived back in Trenton on October 10. Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the president, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the Bourbons to France. \\"I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool,\\" Adams said. He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris. =Fries's Rebellion= To pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the Direct Tax of 1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from excise taxes and tariffs. Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a progressive land value tax of up to 1% of the value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran John Fries, rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business. The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace. Fries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion. In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that \\"it was impossible to commit a greater error.\\" =Federalist divisions and peace= On May 5, 1800, Adams's frustrations with the Hamilton wing of the party exploded during a meeting with McHenry, a Hamilton loyalist who was universally regarded, even by Hamilton, as an inept Secretary of War. Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign. Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and Samuel Dexter as Secretary of War. In 1799, Napoleon took over as head of the French government in the Coup of 18 Brumaire and declared the French Revolution over. News of this event increased Adams's desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton. His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition. Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in mid-1800. Napoleon, determining that further conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16‚Äì14 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up demanding that the Treaty of Alliance of 1778 be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property. On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22‚Äì9 and was signed by Adams. News of the peace treaty did not arrive in the United States until after the election, too late to sway the results. As president, Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process. Historian Ron Chernow writes that \\"the threat of Jacobinism\\" was the one thing that united the Federalist Party, and that Adams's elimination of it unwittingly contributed to the party's demise. =Establishing government institutions and move to Washington= Adams's leadership on naval defense has sometimes led him to be called the \\"father of the American Navy.\\" In July 1798, he signed into law An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, which authorized the establishment of a government- operated marine hospital service. In 1800, he signed the law establishing the Library of Congress. Adams made his first official visit to the nation's new seat of government in early June 1800. Amid the \\"raw and unfinished\\" cityscape, the President found the public buildings \\"in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected.\\" He moved into the nearly completed President's Mansion (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, \\"Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.\\" The Senate of the 7th Congress met for the first time in the new Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. On November 22, Adams delivered his fourth State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. This would be the last annual message any president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years. =Election of 1800= 1800 presidential election results With the Federalist Party deeply split over his negotiations with France, and the opposition Republican Party enraged over the Alien and Sedition Acts and the expansion of the military, Adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in 1800. The Federalist congressmen caucused in the spring of 1800 and nominated Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.Ferling, ch. 19. The campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed that the Republicans were the enemies of \\"all who love order, peace, virtue, and religion.\\" They were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored affairs with slaves were used against him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people, while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity. James T. Callender, a Republican propagandist secretly financed by Jefferson, degraded Adams's character and accused him of attempting to make war with France. Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions. Opposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president. Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the president's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams's character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott. The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that \\"the poor old man\\" could do himself in without Hamilton's assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice. On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams's policies and character. Hamilton denounced the \\"precipitate nomination\\" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults, vilifying the president's \\"disgusting egotism\\" and \\"ungovernable temper.\\" Adams, he concluded, was \\"emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president.\\" Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally. Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in what it contained. The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and helped ensure Adams's already-likely defeat. When the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory. On February 17, 1801 ‚Äì on the 36th ballot ‚Äì Jefferson was elected by a vote of 10 to 4 (two states abstained). It is noteworthy that Hamilton's scheme, although it made the Federalists appear divided and therefore helped Jefferson win, failed in its overall attempt to woo Federalist electors away from Adams. To compound the agony of his defeat, Adams's son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died on November 30. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend Jefferson's inauguration. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successors' inaugurations. The complications arising out of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process whereby the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president through the 12th Amendment, which became a part of the Constitution in 1804. =CabinetJudicial appointments= John Marshall, 4th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and one of Adams's few dependable allies Adams appointed two U.S. Supreme Court associate justices during his term in office: Bushrod Washington, the nephew of American founding father and President George Washington, and Alfred Moore. After the retirement of Ellsworth due to ill health in 1800, it fell to Adams to appoint the Court's fourth Chief Justice. At the time, it was not yet certain whether Jefferson or Burr would win the election. Regardless, Adams believed that the choice should be someone \\"in the full vigor of middle age\\" who could counter what might be a long line of successive Republican presidents. Adams chose his Secretary of State John Marshall. He, along with Stoddert, was one of Adams's few trusted cabinet members, and was among the first to greet him when he arrived at the White House. Adams signed his commission on January 31 and the Senate approved it immediately. Marshall's long tenure left a lasting influence on the Court. He maintained a carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation of the Constitution and established the judicial branch as the equal of the executive and legislative branches. After the Federalists lost control of both houses of Congress along with the White House in the election of 1800, the lame-duck session of the 6th Congress in February 1801 approved a judiciary act, commonly known as the Midnight Judges Act, which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts and the Supreme Court. Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges, whom his opponents called the \\"Midnight Judges,\\" just days before his term expired. Most of these judges lost their posts when the 7th Congress, with a solid Republican majority, approved the Judiciary Act of 1802, abolishing the newly created courts. Retirement=Initial years= Adams resumed farming at Peacefield in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited. Most of Adams's attention was focused on farm work. He regularly worked around the farm but mostly left manual labor to hired hands. His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801. In 1803, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800. During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as Benjamin Waterhouse and Benjamin Rush. Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as president, believing that \\"instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice.\\" When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the president by revealing the Sally Hemings affair, Adams said nothing. John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase. The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had written a history of the American Revolution attacking Adams for his \\"partiality for monarchy\\" and \\"pride of talents and much ambition.\\" A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed. Adams did privately criticize the President over his Embargo Act, despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it. John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since \\"abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect.\\" After Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the Boston Patriot newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and \\"had gathered dust for eight years.\\" Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in a duel with Aaron Burr, Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career. Adams supported the War of 1812. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a \\"national character\\" that accompanied it. Adams supported James Madison for reelection to the presidency in 1812. Daughter Abigail (\\"Nabby\\") was married to Representative William Stephens Smith, but she returned to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of breast cancer in 1813. =Correspondence with Jefferson= In early 1801, Adams sent Thomas Jefferson a brief note after returning to Quincy wishing him a happy and prosperous presidency. Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In 1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death of his daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office. John Adams, c. 1816, by alt=An unsmiling elderly man sits in a red chair, slightly pointing left. In early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook. Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the Declaration of Independence who had been corresponding with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly note to Jefferson to accompany a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams. Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters ‚Äì 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson. Early on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a discussion of their actions in the political arena. Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that \\"nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age.\\"Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, June 27, 1813. Cappon p. 338. Adams made one more attempt, writing that \\"You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other.\\"John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, July 15, 1813. Cappon p. 358. Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits. As the two men became older, the letters grew fewer and farther between. There was also important information that each man kept to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield. =Last years and death= Abigail died of typhoid on October 28, 1818, at their Quincy home, Peacefield. The year 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a four-way presidential contest which included John Quincy. The Marquis de Lafayette toured the country and met with Adams, who greatly enjoyed Lafayette's visit to Peacefield. Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives. He remarked, \\"No man who ever held the office of President would congratulate a friend on obtaining it.\\" Tombs of John and Abigail Adams (far) and John Quincy and Louisa Adams (near), in family crypt at alt=3 marble sarcophagi, one in the foreground, 2 in the background are seen. 2 are seen with flags of the United States at the top. Less than a month before his death, Adams issued a statement about the destiny of the United States, which historian Joy Hakim characterized as a warning for his fellow citizens: \\"My best wishes, in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be shaped by the human mind.\\" On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Adams died at Peacefield at approximately 6:20 PM. His last words included an acknowledgement of his longtime friend and rival: \\"Thomas Jefferson survives.\\" Adams was unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before. At 90, Adams became the longest-lived US president until Ronald Reagan surpassed him in 2001. John and Abigail Adams's crypt at United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts, also contains the bodies of John Quincy and Louisa Adams. Political writings=Thoughts on Government= alt=title page of Adam's pamphlet During the First Continental Congress, Adams was sometimes solicited for his views on government. While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet Common Sense, which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by John Locke. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had \\"a better hand at pulling down than building.\\" He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were \\"so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work.\\" What Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement. Some delegates urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled Thoughts on Government and styled as \\"a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend.\\" Many historians agree that none of Adams's other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet. Adams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends ‚Äì the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote that, \\"There is no good government but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men.\\" The treatise defended bicameralism, for \\"a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual.\\"Adams, Vol. IV, p. 195, \\"Thoughts on Government\\" Adams suggested that there should be a separation of powers between the executive, the judicial and the legislative branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it \\"should sacredly be confined\\" to certain enumerated powers. Thoughts on Government was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that John Dickinson's fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it. =Massachusetts Constitution= After returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin, to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting Constitution of Massachusetts was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive ‚Äì though restrained by an executive council ‚Äì with a qualified (two- thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, allowed to \\"hold their offices during good behavior.\\" The Constitution affirmed the \\"duty\\" of the individual to worship the \\"Supreme Being,\\" and that he had the right to do so without molestation \\"in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.\\" It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to the children of all citizens. Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars of the Enlightenment. He believed that people \\"in a State of Ignorance\\" were more easily enslaved while those \\"enlightened with knowledge\\" would be better able to protect their liberties. Adams became one of the founders of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780. =Defence of the Constitutions= Adams's preoccupation with political and governmental affairs ‚Äì which caused considerable separation from his wife and children ‚Äì had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: \\"I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and Porcelaine.\\" While in London, Adams learned of a convention being planned to amend the Articles of Confederation. In January 1787, he published a work entitled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States. The pamphlet repudiated the views of Turgot and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks. He suggested that \\"the rich, the well-born and the able\\" should be set apart from other men in a senate ‚Äì that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams's Defence is described as an articulation of the theory of mixed government. Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to Aristotle, a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy ‚Äì that is, the king, the nobles, and the people ‚Äì was required to preserve order and liberty. Historian Gordon S. Wood has maintained that Adams's political philosophy had become irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of popular sovereignty was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Yet Wood was accused of ignoring Adams's peculiar definition of the term \\"republic,\\" and his support for a constitution ratified by the people. On separation of powers, Adams wrote that, \\"Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest.\\"Works of John Adams, IV:557 This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, \\"[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition,\\" in Federalist No. 51, explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution. Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong executive would defend the people's liberties against \\"aristocrats\\" attempting to take it away. On the government's role in education Adams stated that, \\"The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves.\\"Adams, Letter to John Jebb, Vol. 9, p. 540. Adams first saw the new United States Constitution in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it \\"with great satisfaction.\\" Adams expressed regret that the president would be unable to make appointments without Senate approval and over the absence of a Bill of Rights. \\"Should not such a thing have preceded the model?\\" he asked. Political philosophy and views=Slavery= Adams never owned a slave and declined on principle to use slave labor, saying, \\"I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap.\\" Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom. Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should \\"sleep for a time.\\" He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to opposition from Southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery. =Accusations of monarchism= Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions. At times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches, suggesting for example that \\"hereditary monarchy or aristocracy\\" are the \\"only institutions that can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people.\\" Yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas, calling himself \\"a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy\\" and \\"no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in America.\\" Such denials did not assuage his critics, and Adams was often accused of being a monarchist. Historian Clinton Rossiter portrays Adams not as a monarchist but a revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with the stability of monarchy to create \\"ordered liberty.\\" His 1790 Discourses on Davila published in the Gazette of the United States warned once again of the dangers of unbridled democracy. John Adams by alt=An elderly man sits in a red chair with his arms crossed, looking slightly left. Many attacks on Adams were scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to \\"crown himself king\\" and \\"grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne.\\" Peter Shaw has argued that: \\"[T]he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ... Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch ... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life.\\" In contrast to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: According to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: practical study of past and present governments, and Scottish Enlightenment thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics. Adams's conclusion was that the great danger was that an oligarchy of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive. =Religious views= Adams was raised a Congregationalist, since his ancestors were Puritans. According to biographer David McCullough, \\"as his family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that.\\" In a letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World. He believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett (1966) concludes that \\"Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness\\" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection. Fielding (1940) argues that Adams's beliefs synthesized Puritan, deist, and humanist concepts. Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been revelatory, but was being misinterpreted in the service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power. Frazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology, \\"Adams clearly was not a deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe in miracles or God's providence. ... Adams did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation.\\"Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). The Political Theology of the American Founding. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 46. Frazer argues that Adams's \\"theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism.\\"Frazer, Gregg L. (2004). The Political Theology of the American Founding. PhD dissertation. Claremont Graduate University. p. 50. In 1796, Adams denounced Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, \\"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.\\" But historian Gordon S. Wood (2017) writes, \\"Although both Jefferson and Adams denied the miracles of the Bible and the divinity of Christ, Adams always retained a respect for the religiosity of people that Jefferson never had; in fact, Jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings.\\" In his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society. He became a Unitarian, rejecting the divinity of Jesus. David L. Holmes argues that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of his miracles as true. Legacy=Historical reputation= Franklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, \\"He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses.\\" Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and honorable career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders. Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders. Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans. He was often described as \\"prickly\\", but his tenacity was fed by decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: \\"[As President] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore.\\" Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. \\"Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right,\\" he wrote. His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection. Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned. According to Ferling, Adams's political philosophy fell \\"out of step\\" with the way that the country was heading. The country tended further away from Adams's emphasis on order and the rule of law and towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his retirement from public life, as first Jeffersonianism and then Jacksonian democracy grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten. When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way. In the 1840 presidential election, Whig candidate William Henry Harrison was attacked by Democrats on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams. Adams was eventually subject to criticism from states' rights advocates. Edward A. Pollard, a strong supporter of the Confederacy during the American Civil War, singled out Adams, writing: In the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers, in accordance with his predictions. McCullough argued that \\"[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him.\\" Todd Leopold of CNN wrote in 2001 that Adams is \\"remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues.\\" He has always been seen, Ferling says, as \\"honest and dedicated\\", but despite his lengthy career in public service, Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as \\"staunch, honest, stubborn and somewhat narrow.\\" In his two-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that \\"Adams was his own worst enemy.\\" He criticizes him for his \\"pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity\\", and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling believes that the man who emerges is one \\"perpetually at war with himself\\", whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity. In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled John Adams. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, \\"plays down or explains away\\" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams's reputation. In 2008, a miniseries was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring Paul Giamatti as Adams. =In memoriam= Adams is commemorated as the namesake of various counties, buildings, and other items. One example is the John Adams Building of the Library of Congress, an institution whose existence Adams had signed into law. Unlike many other Founders, Adams does not have a monument dedicated to him in Washington, D.C., although a family inclusive Adams Memorial was authorized in 2001 and awaits funding. According to McCullough, \\"Popular symbolism has not been very generous toward Adams. There is no memorial, no statue ... in his honor in our nation's capital, and to me that is absolutely inexcusable. It's long past time when we should recognize what he did, and who he was.\\" NotesReferences=Sources=Biographies  * * Specialized studies   * * Scherr, Arthur (2018).

Adair and W. Haeberli. Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences \\"Henry Herman Barschall\\" (obituary) by W. Haeberli, P. M. DeLuca, J. C. Davis. Physics Today Jun 1997, Vol. 50 Issue 6, p. 106-8 Biography Barschall was born as Heinrich Hermann Barschall in Berlin, Germany; his father was a patent attorney who had received a Ph.D. in chemistry after studying with Nobel Laureates Emil Fischer and Fritz Haber. After beginning study in several universities in Germany, he emigrated to the United States in 1937 during the early Holocaust period; though raised as a Lutheran, he had some Jewish ancestry. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1940 under the direction of Rudolf Ladenburg; he also worked closely with John A. Wheeler. After a suggestion by Niels Bohr, he carried out in only a few days with fellow graduate student Morton H. Kanner the first demonstration of fission by fast neutrons and thorium and uranium.\\"Study of uranium and thorium fission produced by fast neutrons of nearly homogeneous energy. Phys. Rev. 56:168..\\" Phys. Rev. 57:372 (1939). His thesis was on the interaction of fast neutrons with helium. In a paper with John A. Wheeler he reported the discovery of spin-orbit coupling in neutron scattering.\\" The scattering of 2.5 MeV neutrons in helium.\\" Phys. Rev. 58:682. (1940) He worked at the University of Kansas, and then at the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico continuing his work with fast neutrons. In 1946 he joined the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he remained for most of his career following a program on determining fast neutron cross-sections, directing the doctoral dissertation research of over forty students. In 1970, his laboratory was destroyed by a terrorist attack on a military research facility there, which seriously injured one of his graduate students and killed a member of another research group. In dismay, he stopped work in nuclear physics, and left for two years at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories where he worked on the development of intense sources of high-energy neutrons for materials testing and medical uses. Returning to Wisconsin, with a joint appointment in the departments of Nuclear Engineering and Physics‚Äîand, later, also Medical Physics, he concentrated on the medical application of neutrons in cancer therapy until his retirement in 1986. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987. His doctoral students include Charles K. Bockelman. Legacy and other notable works Barschall was the first recipient of the Bonner Prize, an editor of Nuclear Physics Review C, a member of the board of the American Institute of Physics, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was editor of Physical Review C for 15 years, and chairman of the publications committee of the American Physical Society. In addition to his scientific work, he was noted for an article he published in Physics TodayHenry H. Barschall (July 1988), \\"The Cost-Effectiveness of Physics Journals,\\" Physics Today 41(7):56-59. discussing the cost of scientific journals. In this article he demonstrated the dramatically lower costs associated with publishing in non-profit society journals as compared to those of commercial publishers. This article provoked a lawsuit from Gordon and Breach, one of the publishers discussed‚Äîthe one with the highest costs. The company sued Barschall, the American Physical Society, and the American Institute of Physics, in the United States and in several countries in Europe. The eventual decision fully supported Barschall.For detailed summary of case, see His autobiography appears at H.H. Barschall, \\"Reminiscences,\\" Physics in Perspective 1 (1999) 390-444.'H.H.

A former student of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and member of the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, he is now honorary professor at the Coll√®ge de France. Biography From an classical background, which he described as \\"uncultured\\", Veyne took up archaeology and history by chance, at the age of eight, when he discovered a piece of an amphora on a Celtic site close to the village of Cavaillon. He developed a particular interest in Roman civilization since it was the best-known in the environment in which he grew up. The family having moved to Lille, he assiduously studied the Roman collections of the archaeological museum there, where he received guidance from the curator. He maintains that his interest in the Greeks and Romans stems not from any humanist impulse or any specific admiration, but just from his chance discovery as a child. Having come to Paris for his kh√¢gne, he had a sudden moment of political awakening in front of the bas-relief that celebrates the liberation of the city at the bottom of the Boulevard St. Michel and joined the Communist Party of France. He left the party four years later, without ever having had a true political conviction. On the other hand, the bad treatment of the Algerians at the hands of the colonials revolted him in equal measure to the atrocities of the Nazis. Once again, however, his shock was neither social nor political, but moral. Paul Veyne studied at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris 1951-55. He was a member of the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome 1955-1957, whereupon he settled in Aix- en-Provence as a professor at the University of Provence. It was in his years in Aix that he published his provocative Comment on √©crit l'histoire, an essay on the epistemology of history.Paul Veyne, Comment on √©crit l'histoire : essai d'√©pist√©mologie, Paris: Le Seuil 1970. At a time when the dominant trend in French historiography favored quantitative methods, Veyne's essay unabashedly declared history to be a \\"true tale\\". Through his essay he became an early representative for the interest in the narrative aspects of scientific history. His monograph on Evergetism from 1975 (Le pain et le cirque), however, demonstrated that Veyne's concept of narrative somewhat differed from its common use, and that his differences with the hegemonic Annales school was smaller than what had seemed to be the case in 1970.Paul Veyne, Le pain et le cirque, Paris: Le Seuil 1976. The book is a comprehensive study of the practice of gift-giving, in the tradition of Marcel Mauss, more in line with the anthropologically influenced histoire des mentalit√©s of the third Annalistes generation than with \\"old-fashioned\\" narrative history. In 1975 Veyne entered the Coll√®ge de France thanks to the support of Raymond Aron, who had been abandoned by his former heir apparent Pierre Bourdieu. However, Veyne, by failing to cite the name of Aron in his inaugural lecture, aroused his displeasure, and according to Veyne he was persecuted by Aron ever since this perceived sign of his ingratitude. Veyne remained there from 1975 to 1999 as holder of the chair of Roman history. In 1978 Veyne's epistemological essay was reissued in tandem with a new essay on Michel Foucault as a historian: \\"Foucault r√©volutionne l'histoire.\\"Paul Veyne, Comment on √©crit l'histoire, suivi par \\"Foucault r√©volutionne l'histoire\\"; Paris: Le Seuil 1978. In this essay Veyne moved away from the insistence on history as narrative, and focused instead on how the work of Foucault constituted a major shift in historical thinking. The essence of the Foucauldian 'revolution' was, according to Veyne, a shift of attention from 'objects' to 'practices', to highlight the way the epistemological objects were brought into being, rather than the objects themselves. With this essay Veyne established himself as an idiosyncratic and important interpreter of his colleague. The relationship between the historian of antiquities and the philosopher also influenced Foucault's turn towards antiquity in the second volume of the History of Sexuality,David Halperin, One Hundred Years of Homosexuality, New York: Routledge, 1990, page 64. as well as his reading of liberalism in his public lectures (1978-9).Foucault, Michel. The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-1979). Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, 317-8. In 2008 Veyne published a full-length book on Foucault, reworking some of the themes from his 1978 essay, expanding it to an intellectual portrait.Paul Veyne, Foucault.

Born in Glasgow, Aitkenhead came to Canada as a young child with his family, and grew up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Playing career Andy Aitkenkead played ten years in various minor leagues in Western Canada, most notably appearing in the 1923 Memorial Cup with the Saskatoon Quakers. After turning pro, Aitkenhead took two teams to the Allan Cup finals, the Saskatoon Nationals and the Saskatoon Empires, in 1924 and 1926 respectively. Originally taken by the Rangers in the Inter- league draft from the Saskatoon Shieks in 1928, his rights were sent back and forth between the Rangers and the Portland Buckaroos of the PCHL, until he finally signed with the Rangers as a free agent in 1931. He made his debut for the Rangers on November 10, 1932, at the Montreal Forum against the Montreal Maroons. He won the job as starting goaltender for the Rangers from John Ross Roach, who had twice led the team to the Stanley Cup Final. In his first two seasons in New York, Aitkenhead played in every single game for the Rangers, and he put up solid numbers. In his first season in New York, Aitkenhead was fourth in the league in goals against average, as well as fourth in wins. In that rookie season, he led the Rangers to the Stanley Cup, their second, in 1933. He posted a shutout in the clinching game, in overtime, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The following season, Aitkenhead finished fifth overall in goals against, yet second in wins, and third in shutouts, however the Rangers were eliminated by the Maroons in the opening round of the playoffs. In 1935 Aitkenhead struggled, and eventually lost the starting job to Dave Kerr. He played only 10 games that season. Kerr later said that Aitkenhead's obsession with his game were what got to him, and led to his departure from the NHL. After 1935 Andy Aitkenhead was returned to the minor leagues. Aitkenhead spent 6 seasons with the Portland Buckaroos of the PCHL before retiring from hockey in 1941. Legacy In the 2009 book 100 Ranger Greats, the authors ranked Aitkenhead at No. 97 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team's first 82 seasons. Aitkenhead was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. Trivia * Wore Uniform #1 for the New York Rangers. * He was known as \\"The Glasgow Gobbler\\".

Forming as a tropical depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near Barbados, Jerry intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear. After reaching its peak of 50 mph (80 km/h), Jerry passed just south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8. Shortly after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, moderate upper-level wind shear affected Jerry's upper- level outflow, and the cyclone weakened to a depression shortly afterwards. Deterioration in organization continued, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico. Jerry caused minimal effects in the Lesser Antilles. Meteorological history A tropical wave moving westward off the African coast on October 1, 2001 entered the tropical Atlantic. The wave's organization changed little until October 4 as it moved westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an area of low pressure was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST. Located east-southeast of Barbados, the twelfth depression of the season moved just north of due west, steered quickly at 20 to 25 mph (40 km/h) by a ridge of high pressure in the lower to middle troposphere. At 5 p.m. AST later on October 6, the NHC noted that the depression was nearing tropical storm strength. Shortly after, a burst of heavy convective thunderstorms developed over the ill-defined low-level center, and as organization improved, the system was upgraded to 40 mph (65 km/h) Tropical Storm Jerry around midnight on October 7. Located within an environment of weak vertical wind shear, Jerry strengthened further, with its maximum sustained winds reaching their estimated peak of around 50 mph (80 km/h) as Jerry approached the Windward Islands later on October 7. Jerry passed just south of Barbados at its peak intensity, followed by a slowing of forward speed and jog to the northwest as Jerry entered the Windward Islands early on October 8. Reconnaissance aircraft also indicated a possible reformation of the center, as data indicated multiple low-level rotations on a northeast to southwest axis. As Jerry entered the eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after bypassing St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40 km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite observations indicated that the storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad area of low pressure with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230 miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Jerry over the Windward Islands on October 8 Due to the tropical cyclone's short life, overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts did not anticipate Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models indicated the system would reach hurricane status within two to three days under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT. Jerry caused minimal damage as it moved through the Windward Islands and Lesser Antilles. A station at Martinique reported sustained one-minute winds of 44 mph (72 km/h) on October 8. The outer bands of Jerry delivered light rainfall to Grenada on October 8, but no damage was reported. Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.

H. Richardson and built in the late 1870s. It is located in Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, recognized as one of Richardson's mature masterpieces. History Sever Hall was built from 1878 to 1880 with a gift from Anne Sever in honor of her deceased husband, James Warren Sever. It was designed as an academic building with classrooms, lecture halls, rooms for professors, etc., in a style now known as Richardsonian Romanesque though in red brick rather than stone. The building is 176 feet and 4 inches long, by 74 feet and 4 inches wide, with a height to cornice of about 50 feet, above which the hipped roof rises a further 30 feet. It is three stories tall, with a fourth story set within the roof. The main facade (west side) features two round bays set symmetrically about an entrance within a deeply recessed semi- circular archway. The east facade is similar but with a simpler, rectangular entrance. North and south facades are relatively austere expanses punctuated with windows. About 1.3 million bricks were used in its construction. Of these, some 100,000 form the exterior facades, which feature 60 different varieties of red molded brick, as well as elaborate brick carvings. Blood mortar was used as a joiner originally, though polybond compounds have been used in restoration efforts since 1967. The archway admitting entrance into the west facade possesses an acoustical oddity. Whispering directly into the bricks of the archway, while standing very close to one side of the arch, can be heard clearly on the other side of the arch (approximately twelve feet away). In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Sever Hall among architectural historians, due to Robert Venturi's comment that it is his \\"favorite building in America.\\" He told Boston Globe critic Robert Campbell: \\"I have come to understand the validity of architecture as generic shelter rather than abstract-expressive sculpture, and as flexible loft for accommodating evolving functions. ... And then I love Sever Hall also for its aesthetic tension deriving from its vital details. I could stand and look at it all day. Thank you, H.H. Richardson.\\" Usage Sever has small classrooms and larger lecture halls, so it is mostly used as a general-purpose classroom building for humanities courses especially small sections, beginning language courses, and Harvard Extension School classes. Grossman Library, a non- circulating library serving Extension School students, was located on the third floor until Extension School library services were integrated into Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences libraries in the late 2010s. The fourth floor of Sever, unnoticed by many of its students as the central stairwell does not lead to it, contains offices for Harvard's Visual and Environmental Studies department. In the evenings and on weekends student groups hold meetings or run annual events. One of Sever's notable annual events is Vericon, run during the break between semesters by the Harvard-Radcliffe Science-Fiction Association.

He was also a writer and a poet. Born in the village of Bani Jamra, al-Jamri became a Hussaini khatib (Shia preacher) after finishing primary school. At the age of 21, he began his Islamic studies, first in Bahrain and later in the religious institute of Al Najaf, Iraq, where he remained for 11 years. He returned to Bahrain in 1973 and was elected to the newly formed parliament. The parliament was dissolved two years later by the Emir, Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa, after it had rejected the State Security Law. In 1977, al-Jamri was appointed as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain. He held the position until 1988, when he was briefly arrested due to his criticism of the government. Al-Jamri is most notable for his role during the 1990s uprising in Bahrain. As the lead figure of the opposition, he succeeded in bringing Islamists, liberals and leftists together against the monarchy. The events began in the form of petitions in 1992 and 1994 calling for restoration of the parliament and reinstatement of the suspended constitution, but led to widespread violence and the death of 40 individuals. Due to his civil rights activity, al-Jamri was imprisoned between April and September 1995, before being arrested again in January 1996 and imprisoned until July 1999, which was followed by a year and a half of house arrest. In January 2001, al-Jamri was released along with other opposition activists. The new emir, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, proposed a reform plan, the National Action Charter of Bahrain, which was accepted by the opposition and later gained widespread popular support. A year later, Hamad issued a new constitution which al-Jamri said fell short of the opposition's demands. Disappointed, al-Jamri soon fell ill, suffering from a series of strokes and eventually dying of multiple organ failure. Early life and Islamic studies Al-Jamri was born in the village of Bani Jamra, Northern Bahrain, on 1 March 1938. His full name was Abdul Amir bin Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Abdulrasool bin Mohammed bin Hussain bin Ebrahim bin Makki bin Suleiman bin Makki al-Jamri al-Bahrani (), although he was also known by his kunya Abu Jameel (). His father - known as Mansoor or Nasir - was a Quranic teacher, owner of a textile workshop, and head of a \\"devout Shia family\\". Al- Jamri's father taught him the Quran and basics of Islamic prayer when he was 6, although died four years later. Al-Jamri finished formal education at Budaiya primary school when he was 12, before becoming a Hussaini khatib (Shia preacher), learning from other well-known khatibs in his village such as his cousin, the renovator Shia khatib Mulla Atiya al-Jamri. He also obtained a job in the Manama Souq, working there until 1962. In 1957, al-Jamri married his cousin's granddaughter, Zahra' Yousif Atiya al-Jamri, who was 16 at the time. In his book The Story of My Life, al-Jamri devoted a section to speak about his marriage, in which he described it as a happy one and praised his wife for her patience and loyalty. They had 10 children together: 7 sons and 3 daughters. One of their sons is Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor-in-chief of Al-Wasat newspaper. In 1959, al-Jamri began his religious studies in Bahrain. He was taught by Sheikh Abdulla al-Bahrani (died 1961) and Sheikh Baqir al-Asfoor. In 1962, following the death of his mentor, al-Jamri traveled to Iraq to study Islamic theology and law in the religious institute of Al Najaf. Mentored for two years by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, he reached the stage of independent research (Bahth al-kharij; ), the highest level of study in religious seminaries. He also wrote several religious articles which were published in Iraqi newspapers and magazines. In the country, al-Jamri used the pseudonym Abdulla Mansoor Mohammed in order to avoid trouble when passing through customs in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, where it was believed that the prefix \\"Abdul\\" should only be used with the name of God. The pseudonym also helped him evade Iraq's Ba'athist regime of Saddam Hussein following an anti-Ba'athist speech which al-Jamri gave in 1970. Spending 11 years in Iraq, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in 1973. Between 1973 and 1981, al-Jamri was a frequent host on Bahrain TV, giving religious talks on Islamic occasions such as Ramadan and Ashura. In 1985, he founded a small hawza in the mosque next to his house. Member of Parliament The religious block in Parliament. Sheikh Abdul Amir al-Jamri is on the right Bahrain became independent from the United Kingdom in 1971 and the Constituent Assembly of 1972 had drafted a new constitution by 1973. Like his study colleague Isa Qassim, al-Jamri initially wanted to complete his religious studies and did not care much about politics. His mentor in Iraq, Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, issued a binding fatwƒÅ for participation in the 1973 parliamentary election. Al-Jamri and five others formed the \\"Religious Bloc\\" which adopted a wide program including supporting the labor's union and demands, forbidding trade of alcoholic beverages, and separating men and women in education institutes. The bloc also called for prohibiting male doctors from treating female patients (especially in pregnancy) as well as other demands connected to traditional Islamic customs. Al-Jamri was elected to the National Assembly of Bahrain, ranking second behind Isa Qassim. In August 1975, the constitution was suspended and the assembly dissolved by the Emir, Isa bin Salman al- Khalifa, after it had rejected the State Security Law. The act - also known as \\"the precautionary law\\" - was proposed by the British adviser Ian Henderson. It gave police wide powers of arrest and allowed individuals to be held in prison without trial or charge for up to three years (renewable) for suspicion \\"that they might be a threat to the state\\". Al-Jamri was a member of a foreign relations committee, and an outspoken critic of the State Security Law. 1977‚Äì1988 In the period from 1975 to 2001, the Emir ruled by decree. Human rights activists and opposition leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, the arbitrary arrest of thousands, and assassinations, all of which were denied by the authorities. Bahrain's Shia population widely claimed that they were being discriminated against by the government, and that they were being treated as second class citizens. =Judge= In 1977, the government offered al-Jamri the opportunity to serve as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain (Shia branch). Al-Jamri agreed after Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei issued him with a religious permit to do so. The decision was controversial within Bahrain, as many Shia clerics had refused to participate in the government-run judiciary ever since its foundation in the 1920s. Al- Jamri held the position until June 1988, when he was suspended due to his criticism of the government. =Political activism= Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and continuing throughout the 1980s, the intensity of Bahrain's political situation sharply increased. Al-Jamri, who was then participating in several petitions, was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance by the Security and Intelligence Service. In 1984, the Islamic Enlightenment institution, with which al-Jamri was associated, was closed by the government. The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars. Al-Jamry however opened his house for daily meetings, also offering a weekly space for public debates; he continued to do so despite several government attempts to stop him. In 1988, the situation came to a head when al-Jamri ignored a final warning by the government. In June, he was dismissed from his job as a judge. In August, his son-in-law Abduljalil Khalil was arrested and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. In September, his elder son Mohamed Jameel was arrested and sentenced to ten years. The authorities then ordered al-Jamri's arrest; on 6 September, Colonel Adel Flaifel and a number of security forces arrived at his house. Al-Jamri's wife rushed to the nearby mosque and called people from its speakers. Amid neighbors' protests, security forces decided to let al-Jarmi go after only an hour's detention. Role during the 1990s uprising=Background= There was a time of civil strife in Bahrain from 1994 to 1999, during which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand democratic reforms. The uprising was the largest in the country's history, and included widespread demonstrations and violence. In 1992, a petition was signed by 280 leading figures in civil society, demanding the restoration of parliament, reinstatement of the suspended constitution, the release of political prisoners, and the start of a reconciliation dialogue. The government rejected their demands and instead set up a thirty-member appointed \\"Shura council\\" assigned with \\"commenting\\" on government proposed legislation. In 1994, another petition was launched with the same demands, this time open to all citizens. Organizers said that they had collected over 20,000 signatures. Violence broke out in June 1994 when riot police used tear gas on 1,500 demonstrators who had organized a sit-in in front of the Ministry of Labor. The protesters were campaigning against the increasing rate of unemployment, which had reached 15 percent. Over the following years, many opposition leaders were arrested and others exiled. Some protesters used Molotov cocktails to attack \\"police stations, banks and commercial properties\\". Riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets, some of which were fired at the crowd from police helicopters. It was also reported that police used live ammunition in some cases. Overall, about forty people were killed, including several detainees who were in police custody (allegedly due to torture), and at least three policemen. During the uprising, al-Jamri \\"rose to prominence\\", becoming the lead figure among the opposition, who saw him as \\"their father figure and spiritual mentor.\\" To the Shia, he was their \\"spiritual leader\\". He was a \\"chief architect\\" and a signatory of the 1992 and 1994 petitions. He was also the informal leader of the U.K.-based Bahrain Freedom Movement. Al-Jamri, himself a Shia Islamist, had good relations with secular and liberal opposition forces and united them into \\"an effective opposition movement\\". Due to his civil rights activity, the pro-democracy cleric was arrested and placed under house arrest for years. =First arrest= In 1995, following clashes between security forces and students, the government accused al-Jamri of having links to Iran and seeking to establish an \\"Islamic republic\\" in Bahrain. Al-Jamri denied the accusations. Nevertheless, on 1 April the government imposed a blockade on al-Jamri's home of Bani Jamra, placing him and 18 members of his family under house arrest. At least one man was killed and 16 others injured during clashes with police. That day became known locally as the Black Saturday. Two weeks later, al-Jamri was transferred to a detention center. Along with other opposition figures he was released on 25 September 1995, following a deal with the government to calm down the situation in return for opening up talks on the restoration of parliament. Tens of thousands of Bahrainis gathered to welcome al-Jamri following his release. He gave a speech in which he promised to stay loyal to the hopes and sufferings of the Bahraini people. =Second arrest, trial and conviction= On 23 October, al-Jamri and other released opposition activists began a 10-day hunger strike in his house to protest what they called the government's failure to fulfill its pledges. Tens of thousands gathered in solidarity with the activists on the final day of the hunger strike (1 November). On 21 January 1996 al-Jamri was detained again along with 7 other opposition leaders, including Abdulwahab Hussain and Hassan Mushaima, following the collapse of the talks. The arrests provoked further unrest. The activists denied the charges of forming a militia group called \\"Bahraini Hizbullah\\" or receiving support from Iran. Al-Jamri spent 3 and a half years in prison, during which he allegedly spent the first 9 months in solitary confinement and was closely observed during the remaining period. On 21 February 1999, about three years after his arrest, al-Jamri's trial before the State Security Court began. On 7 July, the court convicted him on charges of \\"spying and inciting unrest against the royal family\\". Al-Jamri was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and fined BD5.7 million (US$15 million). British politician George Galloway, Human Rights Watch, International Pen and Amnesty International led campaigns in solidarity with al-Jamri. The latter also named him a prisoner of conscience. =Release, reconciliation and disappointment= Emir Isa bin Salman died suddenly on 6 March and was succeeded by his eldest son, Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa. The new emir pardoned al-Jamri and released him a day after his conviction (8 July), but placed him under house arrest until 23 January 2001. Before getting pardoned, al-Jamri had to appear on nationaltelevision and read a \\"humiliating letter of apology\\" to the Emir. Repeated meetings between commissioners of the Emir and al-Jamri were held during the house arrest period. Subsequent days saw the release of further political prisoners, and exiles were allowed to return. On 8 February, al- Jamri and 3 other opposition leaders ‚ÄîAbdulla al-Ghuraifi, Abdulwahab Hussain and Ali Rabea‚Äî met with the emir to discuss his reform plans, the National Action Charter of Bahrain. The Charter called for the introduction of a constitutional monarchy, an independent judiciary, and a bicameral legislature composed of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators. The Charter also granted equal rights between men and women, and recognised all Bahraini citizens as having equal political rights, including the entitlement to elections and political candidacy. In the 8 February meeting, the government promised that \\"the new political arrangements will not invalidate the 1973 constitution and that the upper appointed house will be for consultation only.\\" The next day, after leading Friday prayer, al- Jamri delivered a famous speech, starting with \\"Allah is my witness, I have missed you as much as Jacob missed Joseph\\", before Abdulwahab announced that the opposition had decided to accept the reform plan. The National Action Charter was voted on in a referendum on 14 and 15 February, gaining massive popular support (98.4%). In November 2001, the Al Wefaq Shia political society was founded, with al-Jamri being seen as its mentor. On 14 February 2002, the Emir introduced the new constitution of 2002, which gave him wide-ranging powers and gave the upper appointed house more powers than the elected lower house, including the right to legislate. The \\"honeymoon\\" period between the opposition and government was over; al-Jamri stated his disappointment with the new constitution, stating that it fell short of the opposition's demands. \\"[T]his is not the type of parliament we had demanded,\\" he said. Illness and death Then under house arrest, in May 2000 al-Jamri suffered a heart attack. He was taken to the Bahrain Defence Force Hospital, where he underwent surgery. During his stay at the hospital, he was visited by the King and Prime Minister. In May 2002, al-Jamri traveled to Germany for spinal surgery. While undergoing medical checkups, it was discovered he had a thrombus behind his eye, which had developed when he was in prison. Following the surgery he suffered a stroke, also developing kidney problems and a blood infection, soon falling into a coma. He woke from the coma on 30 June, but shortly after suffered a second stroke, resulting in internal bleeding, and incapacitating him for the rest of his life. On 27 January 2003, al-Jamri was transferred from Germany to Sultan bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City in Saudi Arabia, where his medical condition improved slightly. He returned to Bahrain on 12 July and was welcomed by hundreds of his supporters. His medical condition deteriorated again as he suffered from repeated respiratory problems and another stroke, and in the end he lost the ability to speak. In the early morning of 18 December 2006, al-Jamri was rushed by ambulance from his home to Salmaniya Medical Complex, where he was announced dead. The cause of death was heart and kidney failure. Aftermath=Funeral= Although al-Jamri's death was announced in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times. Ultimately, it began at 6:00 in Muqsha village before moving along the west side of Budaiya highway to Bani Jamra, where al-Jamri was buried at 10:00. The weather was extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain. =Successor= Following the 2002 deterioration of his health, al-Jamri's position as a political and religious leader of Bahrain's Shia opposition was taken over by his lifelong friend, Ayatollah Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented. Publications Al-Jamri wrote several books and poems (in Arabic). He kept writing poems even when he became bedridden.

The Counts Reuss of Greiz, Lower-Greiz and Upper-Greiz () were elevated to princely status in 1778 and thereafter bore the title of Prince Reuss, Elder Line, or Prince Reuss of Greiz. Similarly to the more numerous Reuss Junior Line, the male members of this house were all named \\"Heinrich\\", in honour of Emperor Heinrich VI, who had benefited the family. They were numbered sequentially by birth, rather than by reign, with the last series beginning with Heinrich I (born 1693) and ending with Heinrich XXIV (1878‚Äì1927). Territory The principality of the Reuss Elder Line had an area of 317 km¬≤ and a population of 71,000 (1905). Its capital was Greiz. In 1919, in the aftermath of World War I, the territory of the Elder Line was merged with that of the Junior Line as the People's State of Reuss, which was incorporated into the new state of Thuringia in 1920. The Elder Line died out in 1927 with the death of the childless Heinrich XXIV, after which its claims were passed to the Junior Line.

He was a noted orchestral leader and also a contractor, arranging personnel for many recording sessions. In 1964, he jointly founded the National Philharmonic Orchestra, London together with Charles Gerhardt. The National Philharmonic Orchestra, which was later incorporated in 1970, was a freelance orchestra that included amongst its players leading musicians from all the London orchestras. Sax had often contracted the leaders of most of London's orchestras to populate his first violin section. Recording career Sax brought together the National Philharmonic Orchestra to make several notable recordings with Leopold Stokowski in the 1970s. Their first recording together (for a 'Desmar' LP in April/May 1975) was of Rachmaninov's Symphony No. 3, which had been premiered by Stokowski in 1936. EMI 7243-5-66759-2-6. There were two albums for PYE Records recorded at West Ham Central Mission, in 1976. Record PCNH4 included Saint-Sa√´ns Danse Macabre, with Sidney Sax as solo violinist. There were also CBS recordings made with Leopold Stokowski again at the West Ham Central Mission that included Sibelius's 1st Symphony and the Bizet Carmen and L'Arlesienne Suites, and at EMI's Abbey Road Studios where Stokowski made his very last recordings in 1977, of Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony and Bizet's Symphony in C. Bernard Herrmann was another conductor who recorded with Sax and the National Philharmonic, mainly in film music by himself and other composers, for the Decca / London 'Phase 4' label. Herrmann also recorded his own Symphony with the National Philharmonic for the Unicorn label.

Includes an image of a CD back cover that lists the member of the Ariel Quartet Sax was also a member of The Mantovani Orchestra, leading one of the first post-war tours of the USA with Mantovani and was also part of the Fred Hartley Quintet. For Decca/London 'Phase 4' he recorded a selection of solo-violin-and-orchestra arrangements made by himself (short pieces by Tchaikovsky, Massenet, Korngold, etc.) under the pseudonym Josef Sakonov in which he also conducted the London Festival Orchestra with his violin bow (London 444 786-2). Sax also took part in many notable recordings for a number of famous artists, including Victor Silvester (including \\"Slow Slow Quick Quick Slow\\"), Marianne Faithfull (\\"Is This What I Get for Loving You?\\"). In addition, he played on a number of recordings for The Beatles, \\"Yesterday\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", and \\"All You Need is Love\\" among them. A further large part of his career involved playing on the soundtracks of many films, of a variety of genres, including The Pink Panther Strikes Again, The Boys from Brazil, Paper Tiger, Valentino, and Jesus of Nazareth.

Either he or his wife owned the house in which Thomas Jefferson began his first attempt to draft the United States Declaration of Independence.  Early life  James Finley was born on February 4, 1725 in County Armagh, Ireland, the son of Michael Finley and Anne daughter of Samuel O'Neill. He immigrated to America at the age of nine, and studied under Samuel Blair at Faggs Manor Academy,Dwight Guthrie, \\"Presbyterian Beginnings in the West,\\" Ever a Frontier: The Bicentennial History of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, edited by James Arthur Walther, Wm. B. Eerdmanns Publishing Company, 1994, pages 50-51 in what is now Londonderry Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. In 1752, Finley married Hannah Evans (1715-April 1, 1795), daughter of Robert Evans. The couple had seven sons and two daughters. Eight of their children lived to adulthood. A son, James (1769‚Äì1772), died aged three.Genealogical and Personal History of Fayette County Pennsylvania, Vol. I-II, John W. Jordan, ed. New York, USA: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1912 James was brother of Andrew Finley and brother and student of Samuel Finley, (fifth president of the College of New Jersey, later known as Princeton University, from 1761 until 1766).Clan Finley, RADM Herald F. Stout, 2d Ed 2 VV bound as 1, Dover OH:1956, V1 p26 James graduated from Princeton, though actually, he attended and graduated from the predecessor institution then known as William Tennant's Log College, in Neshaminy, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was a cousin of the Finleys, and moved into the Samuel Finley home at the age of six upon the death of his father. Through his brother Samuel, James was likely acquainted with another signer of the Declaration of Independence, Richard Stockton, as well as Oliver Ellsworth, who became the third Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and Ebenezer Hazard, who became Postmaster General.  Ministry  Finley had a revival experience under the influence of Robert Smith and traveled with noted evangelist George Whitfield. Finley was ordained in 1752 and became pastor of East Nottingham Church, near the disputed Maryland- Pennsylvania border. He traveled to western Pennsylvania three or four times before 1782, possibly as early as 1765. In 1771 Finley conducted sabbath services over the Allegheny Mountains under commission from the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia. In 1772 he traveled to Fayette County, Pennsylvania with his son, Ebenezer, to a farm Finley had purchased near Dunlap's Creek. In 1782 he accepted a call from the united congregations at the Forks of the Youghiogheny River to serve as pastor to several congregations and settlements. In \\"Ever a Frontier: The Bicentennial History of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary,\\" a short biography of Finley concludes: \\"Finley was one of the 'honored seven,'\\" all graduates of Princeton College, who carried the responsibility of spreading Christianity and Presbyterianism throughout the expanses of the west. That they did in their own way, so very successfully that the whole area was soon called their \\"Western Zion.\\" Finley died at 1795 at the age of seventy. He left a bequest to Canonsburg Academy, which became Jefferson College and then Washington & Jefferson College. Finley family history holds that during the American Revolution, he was connected to the house where the Declaration of Independence was initially drafted. Web sources have him as owning the house, in which Thomas Jefferson was so uncomfortable that he moved to a boarding house on the edge of town.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~cafamilies/finley/famous.html - Accessed: April 9, 2007 Other sources state that the home where Jefferson wrote the Declaration was owned and occupied by Jacob Graff, a local bricklayer.http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/graff.htm - Accessed: April 9, 2007 Finley was involved in the border dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania in furtherance of the interests of Pennsylvania. He made several trips to then Westmoreland County, likely to the area of present Greene and Washington Counties, where he collected signatures on petitions which are now at NARA in Washington. Some have speculated that these trips were also spying missions carried out for Benjamin Franklin and the Committee of Safety.Clan Finley RADM Herald F. Stout, 2d Ed 2 VV bound as 1, Dover OH:1956, V1 p26 In 1795 Finley was elected to the Pennsylvania State Legislature.List Members of PA State Legislature, PA State Library, Harrisburg The following story was recorded about Finley having a premonition when his third son and fourth child, Ebenezer (1758‚Äì1849), barely escaped an Indian attack: \\"[Ebenezer] came to Fayette county [PA] with his father in 1772 and settled on lands in Redstone township, purchased by his father in 1771. Ebenezer was a daring, hardy lad, and amidst his pioneer surroundings rapidly developed stature and strength. Samuel Finley, who came at the same time, but not a relative, was in charge of the farm, aided by his Negro slaves brought from Maryland. Samuel was drafted for militia duty, but Ebenezer was allowed to go as his substitute. While at Fort Wallace a rider brought news of the approach of Indians, Young Finley was one of the party of twenty men who left the fort, and soon came upon a large body of Indians before whom they retreated, keeping up a running fight. Finley's gun would not go off, and in stopping to fix it he fell behind the others. An Indian with a leveled gun was about to shoot him, when a settler's shot struck him. Finley ran, closely pursued, and soon caught up with the hindmost man, who received the tomahawk, intended for Finley, in the back of his head. Close pressed, but protected by the fire of a comrade, he safely crossed the bridge and reached the fort. A remarkable case of premonition or telepathy, or call it as one may, must here be recorded: During young Finley's running fight and narrow escapes, just mentioned, his father, Rev. James Finley, three hundred miles away, had a strange and undefinable impression that his son was in great danger, but could form no distinct conception of its nature or cause. He fell to his knees and spent a long time in earnest prayer for his son, arising with the comfortable feeling that the danger was past. He made a note of the time, and when a few weeks later he received a letter from his son giving an account of his narrow escapes from death, he saw that the time corresponded exactly with his own strange experience. Rev. Finley was a man of absolute truth‚Äîthe reader must settle for himself what was the cause of this wireless intercourse between father and son and separated by three hundred miles of space.\\" Death James Finley died on January 6, 1795 in Rostraver, Pennsylvania and is buried at Rehoboth Presbyterian Churchyard.

An accessible toilet is designed to accommodate people with physical disabilities. Persons with reduced mobility find them useful, as do those with weak legs, as a higher toilet bowl makes it easier for them to stand up. Additional measures to add accessibility are providing more space and grab bars to ease transfer to and from the toilet seat, and including enough room for a caregiver if necessary. Some countries have requirements concerning the accessibility of public toilets. Toilets in private homes can be modified (retrofitted) to increase accessibility. Description alarm cord tied within reach Public toilets (aka restrooms) can present accessibility challenges for people with disabilities. For example, stalls may not be able to fit a wheelchair, and transferring between the wheelchair and the toilet seat may pose a challenge. Accessible toilets are designed to address these issues by providing more space and bars for users to grab and hold during transfers, and space for an assistant if necessary. Toilets in private homes can be modified to increase accessibility; this is one of the skills of an occupational therapist. Common modifications include: adding a raised toilet seat on top of a standard toilet, installing a taller and more convenient height toilet bowl, attaching a frame or grab bars, and ensuring the toilet paper is within reach and can be detached with one hand. These modifications can enable aging in place for seniors who wish to remain in their homes and communities. =Terminology= Alternative terms are \\"handicapped toilet\\" or \\"toilets for Transgender\\" which are no longer recommended (see disability). Technical designs A moveable wood seat with support bars, that can be placed over the drop hole of a pit latrine. Tanzania. The U.S. Department of Justice published revised regulations for Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \\"ADA\\" in the Federal Register on September 15, 2010. These regulations adopted revised, enforceable accessibility standards called the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design \\"2010 Standards\\" or \\"Standards\\". The 2010 Standards set minimum requirements ‚Äì both scoping and technical ‚Äì for newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. According to ADA the height of toilet bowl shall be 17 inches (430 mm) at a minimum when measured from the floor to the top of the toilet seat. Flush controls shall be hand operated or automatic mounted on the wide side of the toilet area and easily reached and operated. Additionally, there is are important ADA requirement of clear floor space at water closet rooms. The following recommendations are becoming more common in public toilet facilities, as part of a trend towards universal design: * a wheelchair-height toilet, to help the user on and off the toilet, with handles (grab bars); * a bathroom emergency pullstring, in the form of a red cord that reaches the ground, connected to a buzzer and a flashing red light; * a wheelchair-height sink and hand dryer; * a wheelchair-width door; *additional options to upgrade a toilet are pit latrines that include a moveable wood seat with support bars. Accessible toilets need larger floor space than other cubicles to allow space for a wheelchair to maneuver. This space is also useful for people who are not necessarily wheelchair users, but still need physical support from someone else. A wheelchair-height changing table is also recommended, but remains rarely available. Accessible changing tables are low and accessible to a wheelchair user, and long enough for a caretaker to change an older child or adult with a disability. Convenient Height accessible toilet 20-21\\" bowl helps stand up and sit down is easier vs. Standard Height toilet. The main purpose of the extra tall bowl toilet is to help standing up and sitting down easier. Designers, residential and commercial building architects and toilet manufacturers are starting to recognize the importance of the appropriate height toilet. Wisconsin based Kohler company has a line of products named Comfort Height¬Æ, with toilet height of 17 inches. American Standard based in Piscataway, NJ has a toilet product line called Right Height‚Ñ¢ of 16-1/2‚Äù rim height. Convenient Height Company from Massachusetts produces Convenient Height‚Ñ¢ toilets with 20 inch height toilet bowls. The taller than standard and added height toilets are becoming popular when retrofitting homes to become more accessible. = Examples = File:Braille map public toilet Kyoto Japan.jpgA sign with a braille map for a public toilet in Kyoto, Japan.

It was the 9th largest building society in the United Kingdom based on total assets of ¬£7.1 billion at 31 December 2007, until it was acquired by Nationwide Building Society on 1 December 2008. It operated as a trading division of the society, with 50 branches, until it was fully integrated into its parent in November 2014.  History  In January 1847, The Derby Building and Investment Society was formed, with an initial ¬£120 shares offered;The Derby Mercury, 13 January 1847 this was a terminating society which, having achieved its purpose a year ahead of schedule, was wound up in May 1859.The Derby Mercury of 1 June 1859 reported the closing meeting for the society. One of the Directors, Samuel Whitaker, decided to invite a group of business friends to a meeting on 12 August 1859 to discuss the preliminary arrangements for the formation of a permanent society. An immediate decision was taken and on 1 September 1859, the rules of The Derbyshire Permanent Building, Investment and Land Society were registered.Extract from page 3 of \\"The first hundred years: the story of the Derbyshire Building Society 1859-1959\\", published by Bemrose Advertising Ltd., 1959. Copy held at Derby Local Studies Library (reference BA332.2) Samuel Whitaker became the first secretary of the society, which was based at the offices of S Whitaker & Sons at 14 Iron Gate, Derby from 1859. In early 1870, the society moved to 4 Victoria Street, Derby,Advertisement in The Derby Mercury dated 23 March 1870 shows 4 Victoria Street address where it remained for many years.Wright's 1874, Kelly's 1881 and 1891 trade directories In 1966, the society merged with the Ashbourne Permanent Benefit Building Society and the Somercotes Building Society. The Somercotes society may have been based in the Derbyshire village of Somercotes (Alfreton, Amber Valley) where the society has a branch in Leabrooks Road. It also absorbed the Ilkeston Permanent Building Society in 2001. In 2007 the society was rebranded with a new logo containing the Peak District Millstone, and a change of the trading name from \\"The Derbyshire\\" to the legal name of \\"Derbyshire Building Society\\". The new identity incorporated new signage for all branches and replacement passbooks and cashcards for members. The branch in Coventry (signage before Nationwide merger) On 8 September 2008 it was announced that the Derbyshire, along with the Cheshire Building Society, had agreed to a merger with the Nationwide Building Society, the largest such institution. The merger was borne out of increasing fears about the financial security of both the Derbyshire and the Cheshire societies with the former expected to post half-yearly losses of ¬£17 million and the latter posting losses of ¬£10.5 million. As a result of these projected losses no windfall payments were made to the savers of the smaller societies. Unusually there was no vote amongst members as to this proposition, after a special resolution under the Building Societies Act enabling a faster merger. The deal was concluded on 1 December 2008 following agreement by the Financial Services Authority and the Office of Fair Trading. Upon completion of the merger, the society's logo was again changed, this time removing the Peak District millstone image. In May 2013, it was announced that the Derbyshire, Cheshire and Dunfermline brands would be phased out over two years, and branches either rebranded under the Nationwide brand or closed.

He moved to Ivory Coast in 1990 to study at the National Institute of Art. Biography Loueke grew up in what he has described as a family of poor intellectuals in the West African country of Benin. He began playing percussion instruments around the age of 9 but was influenced by an older brother who played guitar, which he began playing himself when he was seventeen. He listened to guitarists George Benson, Kenny Burrell, Joe Pass, and Wes Montgomery. It took Loueke a year to earn the $50 he needed to buy his first guitar. When he lacked money to buy new strings, which had to be bought across the border in Nigeria, he soaked the strings in vinegar to keep them clean. When the strings broke, he replaced them with bicycle brake cables, which damaged the neck of the guitar and compelled him to find a carpenter to fix it. He studied at the National Institute of Art in Ivory Coast, the American School of Music in Paris from 1994 to 1998, Berklee College of Music from 1999 to 2001, and the Thelonious Monk Institute from 2001 to 2003. He got his first professional job by accident. At a club during a break, he took a guitar from the bandstand and started playing it. The club's manager heard him and offered him a job. He played African pop music, but he discovered jazz when a friend returned from Paris with a copy of an album by George Benson. This inspired Loueke to study jazz in Paris. He auditioned for the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz at the University of California Los Angeles. He was selected in a worldwide search by a panel of judges, including jazz musicians Herbie Hancock, Terence Blanchard, and Wayne Shorter. After UCLA, he appeared on Blanchard's albums Bounce (2003) and Flow (2005) and on Hancock's Possibilities (2006) and River: The Joni Letters (2007). He has also worked with Avishai Cohen, Charlie Haden, Angelique Kidjo, Francisco Mela, Gretchen Parlato, Kendrick Scott, Alison Wedding, Brian Blade, Terri Lyne Carrington, Dennis Chambers, Vinnie Colaiuta, Kenwood Dennard, Nathan East, Kenny Garrett, Michael Eckroth, George Garzone, Roy Hargrove, Magos Herrera, Bob Hurst, Alphonso Johnson, Marcus Miller, John Patitucci, Dianne Reeves, Santana, Sting, Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, and Cassandra Wilson. He belongs to the trio Gilfema with Massimo Biolcati and Ferenc Nemeth. Both were his classmates at Berklee in Boston. Gilfema recorded the albums Gilfema (2005), and Gilfema + 2 (2008) for ObliqSound. As a solo act, Loueke recorded the live album In a Trance (2005) for Space Time Records and Virgin Forest (2006) for ObliqSound. He made his major-label debut in 2008 when Blue Note released his album Karibu. NPR praised his fusion of African music with jazz harmonies, vocal inflections, and complex time signatures. The album includes Biolcati and Nemeth and guest appearances by Hancock and Shorter. His album Mwaliko (2010) is a collection of duo and trio performances that combines traditional West African music with jazz. Guests include Ang√©lique Kidjo (a native of Benin), Richard Bona from Cameroon, and American musicians Marcus Gilmore and Esperanza Spalding. Loueke sings in Xhosa-inspired aspects, such as clicks (e.g., Nonvignon from Karibu). He doesn't speak Xhosa, and the singing is akin to scatting, having no linguistic meaning. Awards and honors In early 2008, Loueke's \\"Kponnon Kp√©t√©\\" won Best Traditional World Song in the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards. Virgin Forest was nominated World Fusion Album of the year.Independent Music Awards ‚Äì 7th Annual Winners In 2009 he won a Fellow Award from United States Artists.

The resort functions as a not-for-profit organization. The slope caters primary to beginner skiers and snowboarders, with only 15% of the area designated as advanced. It has one pulse quad chairlift, one triple chairlift, and two magic carpets. Snow Valley also has a variety of features and man made jumps in their beginner and advanced terrain parks. History Snow Valley was opened in 1961 by members of the Eskimo Ski Club. The original lodge was built in 1972 with two rope tows. In 1981 a T-bar replaced one of the rope tows, and limited snow making was added to extend the ski season. In 1988 a Triple chairlift was installed, along with expanded snow making capability. A significant amount of landfill was completed on the North Hill, where present-day terrain park is located. During the summer of 1995, Snow Valley management took over responsibilities of the adjacent Rainbow Valley Campground. The campground operates in the summer off season. During the winter, additional parking and cross country ski tracks utilise the campground. A new lodge was constructed in 2001, replacing the old lodge and maintenance buildings. Additionally in 2001 the first magic carpet was added. A second magic carpet replaced the handle tow in 2003. In 2008, Snow Valley opened a first-of-its-kind high-speed 'pulse' quad chair. This chair replaced the t-bar and opened up more terrain.

Its magnitude was estimated at 8.1 on the scale, and 7.8 on the scale. The tsunami that followed the earthquake killed 52 people. According to the USGS, the earthquake was recorded around 7:39:56 a.m. local time (UTC+11). The focus was 10 km (6 mi) deep and 40 km (25 mi) South South-East of Gizo township on New Georgia Islands in Western Province. There were numerous aftershocks, the largest of which had a magnitude of 6.2.  Tectonic setting  The Australia, Woodlark, and Solomon Sea plates converge to the east-northeast or northeast against the Pacific plate with velocities of 90‚Äì105 millimetres/year. Along much of the plate boundary between the Pacific plate and the Australia/Woodlark/Solomon Sea plates, relative plate-motion is accomplished principally by subduction of the Australia/Woodlark/Solomon Sea plates beneath the Pacific plate. Earthquake ShakeMap showing the mainshock intensity The earthquake's location and focal mechanism are consistent with the earthquake having occurred as underthrusting of the Australia/Woodlark/Solomon Sea plate beneath the Pacific plate, as part of the broader northeast-directed subduction process. The length of faulting was estimated to be about 260¬±50 km. The Solomon Islands arc as a whole experiences a very high level of earthquake activity, and many shocks of magnitude 7 and larger have been recorded since the early decades of the twentieth century. The 2 April earthquake, however, nucleated in a 250 kilometre-long segment of the arc that had produced no shocks of magnitude 7 or larger since the early 20th century. =Warnings= A tsunami warning was issued for the South Pacific Ocean, and advisories issued for Japan and Hawaii. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a warning for Australia's eastern coast, from Queensland's Barrier Reef to Tasmania, and beaches along the coast were closed, while many evacuated to higher ground. However, as the epicenter was close to the Solomon Islands, the tsunami hit before the Hawaiian Pacific Tsunami Warning Center released the warning. As high-magnitude ocean waves propagate at high speeds close to 25 meters per second, they traversed the 55-kilometer distance from the epicenter to Gavo in less than 20 minutes. The S-waves from the earthquake shook the ground and alerted the population, allowing many to flee to high ground before the wave struck. From Honiara, one of the first warnings came from the People First Network's Simbo email station, situated close to the epicentre. PFnet's Technical Advisor David Leeming relates that 20 minutes after the earthquake, Nickson Sioni from Simbo came on the (HF) radio and announced the arrival of a huge wave that had washed away several houses and come inland about 200m. This information was passed on by telephone to the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center who then upgraded their warning to an \\"expanding regional alert\\". This was achieved before the 35-minute arrival time of the wave for the capital Honiara, which in the event proved non-destructive. =Tsunami= Coastal damage in the Solomon Islands shows the effects of the resultant tsunami. At least fifty-two people were reported to have been killed and sixty reported missing when a tsunami triggered by the earthquake struck the Solomon Islands, wiping out thirteen or more villages.Tsunami death toll on Solomon Islands reaches 52, RIA Novosti, 16 April 2007 Thousands were left homeless, and damage is estimated in the millions. The largest waves were reported on the northern tip of Simbo Island, where maximum tsunami run-ups were 12 m, completely washing away two villages, Tapurai and Riquru, and killing 10 people. In South Choiseul, waves 10 meters high swept away villages, gardens and a hospital. About 900 homes were destroyed. The tsunami reached Papua New Guinea, with a family of five reportedly missing from a remote island in Milne Bay Province, which was in the tsunami's path. The beaches and ferry services at Sydney were closed due to tsunami alert.

BBC Music Magazine, September 2009 (Vol. 17 No. 13): p. 26 also learning from Mariss Jansons, Yuri Temirkanov, Esa-Pekka Salonen, George Benjamin and Roberto Carnevale. He was resident conductor at the St. Petersburg Opera and Ballet Theatre from 1994 to 1997. He has served as chief conductor of the State Academy of St Petersburg since 1994.Alan Weston and Laure Voiment, \\"The football-mad conductor taking the helm at Liverpool\\". Liverpool Daily Post, 12 July 2005. In 2002 he won the first prize of the Cadaqu√©s Orchestra International Conducting Competition. Petrenko made his conducting debut with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (RLPO) in November 2004. After this appearance, in July 2005, he was named the RLPO's principal conductor, the youngest-ever conductor in the post, effective with the 2006‚Äì2007 season for an initial contract of 3 years. Since taking up the post, the orchestra's financial situation and attendance have improved. He has also received critical praise for revitalising the orchestra, in Russian repertoire (especially Shostakovich) as well as standard repertoire such as Brahms, and in English music. In May 2007, the RLPO announced that Petrenko had extended his contract with the orchestra to 2012. In September 2009, the orchestra announced a further extension of his contract to 2015, with a change of Petrenko's title to Chief Conductor. In March 2013, the RLPO announced the conversion of Petrenko's contract into an extended open-ended agreement with no specific scheduled time of conclusion, and where Petrenko is to give an advance notice of 3 years of when he wishes to conclude his tenure. His first conducting appearance at The Proms was with the RLPO in August 2008. Petrenko and the RLPO have recorded several compact discs for Naxos. Petrenko's recording of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony won the Gramophone orchestral recording of the year in 2009. In April 2007, Petrenko was one of eight conductors of British orchestras to endorse the 10-year classical music outreach manifesto, \\"Building on Excellence: Orchestras for the 21st Century\\", to increase the presence of classical music in the UK, including giving free entry to all British schoolchildren to a classical music concert. From December 2008 to 2013 Petrenko served as Principal Conductor of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, conducting his first concert with them at the 2009 BBC Proms. Petrenko first conducted the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra in December 2009. In February 2011, the Oslo Philharmonic announced the appointment of Petrenko as its next chief conductor, as of the 2013-2014 season, with an initial contract of 4 years. His Oslo contract calls for 7 weeks of appearances in his first seasons and 10 weeks of appearances in subsequent seasons. In October 2019, his departure from the orchestra in summer 2020 was announced. In August 2013, comments attributed to Petrenko in a Norwegian newspaper that appeared to denigrate female conductors caused controversy, including calls for his resignation from the RLPO. Petrenko subsequently apologised for how his remarks were construed, and stated that his comments were in specific reference to the situation for conductors in Russia, rather than female conductors in general. He also indicated that part of the controversy was due to the fact that the interview was conducted in English, rather than Norwegian. Petrenko also subsequently stated publicly: : \\"I'd encourage any girl to study conducting. How successful they turn out to be depends on their talent and their work, definitely not their gender.\\" In November 2015, Petrenko's Oslo contract was extended through 2020. Petrenko first guest-conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) in March 2016. He returned for a subsequent guest-conducting engagement in April 2017. In July 2018, the RPO announced the appointment Petrenko as its new music director, effective with the 2021-2022 season, with an initial contract of 5 years. He is to hold the title of music director-designate for the 2020-2021 season. In parallel with this RPO announcement, Petrenko is scheduled to stand down as chief conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic at the close of the 2019-2020 season. Simultaneously with the RPO announcement, the RLPO announced that Petrenko is to conclude his RLPO chief conductorship at the close of the 2020-2021 season, and subsequently to take the title of conductor laureate with the RLPO. Personal life Petrenko lives on the Wirral Peninsula with his wife Evgenia Chernysheva-Petrenko, who is herself a conductor, and their two children Alexander (Sasha) and Anya. He is a football aficionado and follower of the club Liverpool F.C. In March 2009, Petrenko was awarded an honorary professorship and Doctor of Letters degree from Liverpool Hope University.

It premiered in Paris on 9 February 1928. Synopsis The film follows the erotic hallucinations of a priest lusting after the wife of a general. Reception and legacy Although accounts differ, it seems that Artaud disapproved of Dulac's treatment of his scenario. The film was overshadowed by Un chien andalou (An Andalusian Dog, 1929), written and directed by Luis Bu√±uel and Salvador Dal√≠. Un chien andalou is considered the first surrealist film, but its foundations in The Seashell and the Clergyman have been all but overlooked. However, the iconic techniques associated with surrealist cinema are all borrowed from this early film. In Lee Jamieson's own analysis of the film, the surrealist treatment of the image is clear. He writes: > The Seashell and the Clergyman penetrates the skin of material reality and > plunges the viewer into an unstable landscape where the image cannot be > trusted. Remarkably, Artaud not only subverts the physical, surface image, > but also its interconnection with other images. The result is a complex, > multi-layered film, so semiotically unstable that images dissolve into one > another both visually and 'semantically', truly investing in film's ability > to act upon the subconscious.\\"Lee Jamieson \\"The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The > Film Theory of Antonin Artaud\\" in Senses of Cinema, Issue 44, July 2007 The British Board of Film Censors famously reported that the film was \\"so cryptic as to be almost meaningless. If there is a meaning, it is doubtless objectionable\\".James Crighton Robertson, The Hidden Cinema: British Film Censorship in Action, 1913-1975, 1993, , p.39Rachael Low, History of British Film, 1970, , p.70 Alan Williams has suggested the film is better thought of as a work of or influenced by German expressionism.Williams, Alan Larson, Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking, USA: Harvard College, 1992 The BFI included The Seashell and the Clergyman on a list of 10 Great Feminist Films, stating: > Germaine Dulac was involved in the avant garde in Paris in the 1920s. Both > The Smiling Madame Beudet (1922) and The Seashell and the Clergyman are > important early examples of radical experimental feminist filmmaking, and > provide an antidote to the art made by the surrealist brotherhood. The > latter film, an interpretation of Anton Artaud‚Äôs book of the same name, is a > visually imaginative critique of patriarchy ‚Äì state and church ‚Äì and of male > sexuality. On its premiere, the surrealists greeted it with noisy derision, > calling Dulac ‚Äúune vache‚Äù. Musical scores The silent film is popular with musicians and has been scored by many groups.

Plot Three crates arrive to the harem. Inside each is a gagged, buxom, chastity belt-wearing Western woman: the sole heir of a \\"chain store king of the United States\\", a film actress dubbed \\"the new Scandinavian love goddess\\" in the media, and an Asian-European equestrian champion. Sheikh Sharif lies in bed while his personal sex slave, Katsina, lovingly rubs her breasts against him. Sharif confirms his promise to let her accompany him on his travels the next day, starting after meeting with an American oil businessman, who is accompanied by an American Navy commander. Ilsa, who manages the harem, promises luxury to the new women, but they oppose their white slavery. Ilsa, who herself has no lover, declines having a Western man kidnapped for her, stating she is repulsed by the notion of a man who would sleep with her just because he must. Ilsa prepares them by forcing them to perform cunnilingus and erotic massage on one of her lesbian bodyguards. To satisfy fetish demands, Ilsa has an existing sex slave force-fed, and then inspects two other consensually- fattened sex slaves. Silicone is used to enhance the buttocks of another. A public auction is held to sell existing male and female sex slaves. When a belly dancer is caught spying, Ilsa uses a fiendish torture device to crush the belly dancer's large bare breasts. The victim reveals the American commander sought inside information. The Americans arrive. The businessman is offered a woman, but refuses. He later finds in his bedroom a young boy sex slave, who claims that refusal would mean severe punishment for the boy. Ilsa immediately has an eye for the commander and dresses up. Crowding together on a couch near her bedroom, her lesbian bodyguard duo perform a make-out session, but he is uninterested. She insults his manhood and he reacts by groping her. She sends him away, but he shoves her into bed. She is angered at first, but eventually chooses to have sex. Ilsa devises penetration-triggered, exploding diaphragms, using a mechanical dildo machine to demonstrate it on the belly dancer/spy, who dies. Sharif has one put in Katsina while she is unconscious, and then prepares her to visit a rival sheikh. Sharif is about to sleep with the American heiress, when a vengeful local subject accidentally snipes her to death. The American commander disapproves when the sniper is burned to death without a trial. Sharif finds the commander in bed with Ilsa. Sharif puts the commander in prison, then has Ilsa tied up. He has a leper grope her large bare breasts, then performs cunnilingus on her, then mount her and reach a climax while the others watch in horror. Once she \\"learns her lesson\\", Ilsa initiates a rebellion. She frees the commander, killing his prison guard and a tarantula that has almost entered his face-cage. Ilsa reveals that Sharif's young nephew, Prince Salim, is locked up to prevent him inheriting the sheikhdom. Ilsa's bodyguard duo free the two remaining new sex slaves and give them guns. Sharif's guards kill Ilsa's bodyguards, but she captures Sharif and frees Prince Salim. Sharif is chained and gagged. Ilsa tells his loving Katsina that Sharif's final wish before his execution is sleeping with her, then removes Katsina's chastity belt. Knowing about her diaphragm-bomb, Sharif twists beneath his gag, but Katsina mounts and rapes him. Sharif tries to withhold himself, but Ilsa encourages Katsina to push herself harder on top of him, activating the bomb. The commander arrives just then, reminds Ilsa that Katsina was innocent, and dumps Ilsa in resentment. Nevertheless, he reminds the prince that Ilsa did save his life, when she pledges her allegiance to him. Unimpressed, the prince sentences Ilsa to slow starvation and releases the commander to leave the country.

The term is predominantly used in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia to describe a style of underpant that is similar in look to a pair of shorts. French knickers are worn from the hip, concealing some of the upper thigh and all of the buttocks. The garment features an \\"open leg\\" style (a loose fitting leg opening without elastic cuffs) that allows for a more comfortable fit and the straight-cut leg cuffs can be designed with or without trimming. The fabric is often bias cut. French knickers are not to be confused with other underpant styles such as hipsters, briefs, bikini bottoms and boyshorts, all of which feature elasticated leg openings and fit snug to the body. French knickers are ideally accompanied by full, flared and A-Line skirts, trousers and dresses, as they can add bulk and produce a visible panty line (VPL). The item is an elegant, comfortable and healthier alternative to more fitted forms of underwear and luxury fabrics like silk are often used in their production.  History  The French knicker style evolved from drawers, the baggy long-legged underwear of the Victorian era, and may have derived its name from the frilly underwear worn by Parisienne Can-Can dancers, existent from the late-1800s to the early-1900s; the French however, do not use the term. During the 1920s and 1930s, French knickers were very popular, but by the 1940s and 1950s, briefs were worn by most women; perhaps due to fabric shortages and the scarcity of silk. By the 1950s, the fitted underpant was almost universally worn. During the nostalgia revival of the 1970s, French knickers returned to fashion through the designs of Janet Reger and others, and were especially popular in the 1980s for a speciality market. The popularity of French knickers declined again during the 1990s as younger consumers displayed a greater interest in other underwear styles, such as briefs and thongs. They are still available today, and most often found in vintage reproduction and speciality retailers.

Legal worked briefly in the United States where he studied to acquire a knowledge of English. He was sent as a missionary to the Canadian northwest in 1881. He arrived at St. Albert, North-West Territory and was sent to carry out missionary work with the Northern Peigan Blackfoot people as well as pastoral duties in Fort Macleod, to take over from Father Constantine Scollen who had established the first mission to the Blackfoot people of the southern North-West Territory in 1873, along with Father Leon Doucet, near Calgary.

The group included famed session keyboard player Nicky Hopkins, who had worked with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck, and many others; folk guitarist, singer, and past session man Alun Davies (subsequently a frequent collaborator of Cat Stevens'); and singer, guitarist, composer and past Davies cohort Jon Mark (later of Mark-Almond). Thus Sweet Thursday was arguably a minor instance of the \\"supergroup\\" phenomenon. Other members were drummer Harvey Burns and bassist, woodwinds player and songwriter Brian Odgers. In December 1968, Tetragrammaton released a single which contained \\"Getting It Together\\" (Side A) and \\"Mary On The Runaround\\" (Side B) which were composed by Jon Mark but were not included on the group's lone album. Both songs were released as bonus tracks on a CD edition of the group's debut album Sweet Thursday. The group's lone album Sweet Thursday was released in August 1969 in the U.S. on Tetragrammaton Records (the band had signed with that label in November 1968). It is most remembered for the ten-minute-long progressive rock radio turntable hit \\"Gilbert Street\\", written by Patrick Gunning in 1967. The record company went bust soon thereafter, after only a very limited record pressing. Sweet Thursday dissolved.

Life  Mary's parents are not known. She married Jonathan Barber, a woollen-draper in Capel Street, Dublin. Her son Rupert Barber (1719-1772) was a crayon and miniature painter from Dublin, whose pastel portrait of Swift hangs in the National Portrait Gallery London. They had nine children, four of whom survived to adulthood. She wrote, in the preface to her Poems, that she wrote mainly in order to educate her children, but most commentators agree that she had a larger audience in view and was considerably engaged with intervening in wider social and political issues, as she did with \\"The Widow's Address\\" when she argued on behalf of the widow of an army officer. She is an example of the eighteenth-century phenomenon of the \\"untutored poet, or 'natural genius'\\": an artist of unprepossessing background who achieved the patronage of literary or aristocratic notables.Christopher Fanning, \\"The Voices of the Dependent Poet: the case of Mary Barber ,\\" Women's Writing 8.1 (2001): 81. Swift named her as part of his \\"triumfeminate,\\" along with poet and scholar Constantia Grierson and literary critic Elizabeth Sican, and maintained that she was a preeminent poet ‚Äî \\"the best Poetess of both Kingdoms\\"Swift, 1733, The correspondence of Jonathan Swift, ed. H. Williams, 5 vols. (1963‚Äì5), cite. Lonsdale 119; Coleborne. ‚Äî though this assessment was not universally shared and she has only recently garnered much critical attention. She moved into his circle and knew Laetitia Pilkington, who later became her harshest critic, Mary Delany, and poets Thomas Tickell, and Elizabeth Rowe. Swift's patronage was a substantial support to Barber's career and her Poems on several occasions (1734) was successful. The subscription list for the volume was almost \\"without precedent for its resplendent length and illustrious contents, and it was moreover remarkable given Barber's otherwise pedestrian social standing as an ailing Irish housewife.\\" Adam Budd, \\"'Merit in distress': The Troubled Success of Mary Barber,\\" The Review of English Studies 53.210 (2002):204-227 (204). There were over nine hundred subscribers including various aristocrats and a number of literary luminaries, notably Pope, Arbuthnot, Gay, Walpole, and of course Swift himself. She did not, however, achieve financial stability until at her request and in order to alleviate her financial distress, Swift gave her the English rights to his Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation (1738). Her health declined after the publication of her Poems and subsequent writing was sparse. She did publish some verses about the gout, from which she suffered for over two decades, in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1737. She died in or around 1755.  Career  Due to the less than favorable situation of poverty Mary Barber's family appeared to be in, she did everything in her power to educate her children and often used her poetry to appeal to the generosity of others in order to obtain the most advantageous positions for her children. This is especially evident through poems like 'The Hibernian Poetess's Address and Recommendation of Her Son, to her dear Cousin Esqu; L- M of London'. Although she always said she did write poetry for the education and benefit of her children, before she reached the prestige of publishing she seems to have written letters to help others in socially disadvantaged positions. Once Barber had decided to pursue publishing her poetry as a way of financially supporting her family, however, she clearly approached her publications differently. Being from a lower class she pursued subscription publishing. Before she was well established, it is believed, Barber forged letters from Jonathan Swift to notable royals encouraging them to support her poetic career. While it was a time that the two were supposedly not well acquainted, Swift eventually forgave Barber for her indiscretion and actually embraced supporting her in her newfound literary role by introducing her into his literary circle known as the \\"triumfeminate.\\" This group was actually a trio of female writers that he mentored who assisted each other with the processing of new ideas. It included Constantia Grierson and Mrs. E. Sican, as well as Barber. While it may seem unusual for a writer to allow her work to be drastically changed, ultimately Barber was writing as a means to financially support her family. This is what led to the pursuance of subscription publishing, despite the stigma associated with it at the time. It was common knowledge that subscription publishing was viewed more as a generous offer made by the wealthy than an interest in the works being truly produced. In an effort to preserve her image as more than a grappling beggar that seemed to grow in people's mind she took advantage of the opportunity to officially publish her own work and, thanks to subscription publishing and the aid of Swift, created her collection with a purposeful image. Swift allowed her to include a letter he wrote on her behalf, raving about her attributes saying \\"she seemeth to have a true poetical genius,\\" Swift's letter of praise was quickly followed by her much more modest letter pouring with admiration for the intended audience of John, Earl of Orrery. By including poems written on behalf of others that were admired as social statements (like \\"The Widow Gordon's Petition\\"), or one's written for the benefit of her sons' educations and social up-rise, Barber is attempting to justify her need to write for money, as was often done in the time, while simultaneously reminding her audience that she writes to benefit others as well. However, her reception appears to have only been approached by others because of her association with Swift and eventually disappeared as she did when her gout issues made it harder for her to write. Legacy While Barber was a part of Swift's \\"triumfeminate\\", it appears her more \\"genteel\\" status as an Irish Merchant's wife seemed to harm her and apparently her peers considered their editing of her work to be a major improvement to what she had originally written. Barber seems to have faded substantially from the public eye after her illness removed her physical presence from the literary circle and there is little evidence of interest in her works afterwards. However, in the 1970s-1980s an emerging feminist movement encouraged re-appraisal of past women writers. While these scholars seem to have examined and even done their own editing of Mary Barber's work, there was apparently little interest or enthusiasm expressed by the few scholars who under-took the task. Supposedly her poetry has always been, and remains to be, viewed as average writings by a mother hoping to advance her family, and her works are unfortunately given very little literary value.

Muller. His affiliation with Muller, begun at Figg and Muller Engineers (founded in 1978), allowed him to gain valuable insight into the application of pre-cast segmental bridge construction methods to the domestic market. When they coupled this construction method with cable-stayed supports, Mueller and Figg effectively increased the use of concrete in longer span bridge proposals. He formed his own engineering firm, the Figg Engineering Group, still operating and based in Tallahassee. Figg also founded the American Segmental Bridge Institute in 1989, and served four years as a trustee at the National Building Museum. Awards In 2000, Figg was honored with the John A.

The novel journeys through the birth, life, death, and second life of a man whose family pioneers human-to-android mind transfer. It also explores the ethical and moral issues of transferring consciousness into an android at the moment of death, and examines the idea of prematurely activating an android which has not yet accepted a human brain scan. Plot The story begins as mind transferring has just been banned on Earth by right-wing biofundamentalists. Referred to as ‚Äúbioeffers,‚Äù these terrorists oppose the work of Jonathan Durant, who comes from a dynasty of scientists working to perfect transferring human minds to robot bodies. As bioeffers storm the Durant facilities, Jonathan's wife, Bess, gives birth to a son she names Adam with the help of the family‚Äôs domestic robot. As the new family flees, Jonathon is murdered by a police officer. Bess, her son, and the robot manage to find safe passage to the orbital space colony of Centauria in an adjacent solar system. On Centauria, the robot assistant reveals that Jonathan is alive within him as the first successful mind transfer. The family members raise Adam and work with other scientists on Centauria to improve both robot and mind transfer technology. As their work develops they create an even more intelligent robot named Jonwon. Adam matures, falls in love, and goes to medical school to study the psychiatry of mind transfers. Some scientists attempt to return to Earth to share the knowledge of mind transfer. Nevertheless, tensions continue between Earth and Centauria and culminate in a terrorist attack that damages Centauria‚Äôs communications. The scientists on Earth believe Centauria has been destroyed until the robots and scientists on Centauri develop a new faster- than-light ship to send news of their safety back to Earth. Ultimately, Jonwon grows increasingly disaffected with the state of human-robot relations and steals the faster-than-light ship to travel to the plant of Far. The original cast of characters by now has transferred their minds to robots and pursue Jonwon to discover that Far contains a planetary ocean which emits mind- altering waves. As the protagonists navigate the dangers of the ocean they discover another race of intelligent beings that have also been creating robots of their own. Reception The book‚Äôs reception was lukewarm, receiving praise for its exploration and complication of the original Laws of Robotics. Kirkus review found the book filled with too much dialogue and poorly paced.

Fort McKavett was a frontier fort established as Camp on the San Saba in 1852 to protect settlers from Indian raids. The camp was renamed in honor of Captain Henry McKavett, who was killed in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War battle of Monterrey.\\"Fort McKavett State Historical Park\\" The Handbook of Texas Online Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, Bliss, Richardson, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 48 Subposts or intermediate stations were also used, including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 49 Historic designations On July 4, 1971, Fort McKavett was added to the National Register of Historic Places, number 71000955. The fort received three Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks: In 1936, marker number 4795 for the site of Fort McKavett; in 1963, marker number 1998 for Fort McKavett C.S.A.; and in 1968, marker number 4642 for the Sentry Building. History Colonel Thomas Staniford's 8th Infantry established the post along the San Saba in March 1852, building the first structures, on 2300 acres leased for $600 per year.Sullivan, J.M., 1981, Fort McKavett, A Texas Frontier Post, Lubbock: West Texas Museum Association, Thomas was soon relieved by Major Pitcairn Morrison, who was relieved by Col. Edmund B. Alexander in May 1853. The 8th Infantry was replaced by Colonel Charles A. May's 2nd Dragoons in early 1854. The dragoons were replaced by Col. Henry Bainbridge's 1st Infantry on 15 August 1855, which remained until the fort was abandoned on 22 March 1859 under orders from General David E. Twiggs. Companies C and F were transferred to Camp Cooper. Fort McKavett was abandoned in 1859 as Indian depredation in the area decreased and civilian migration to the area slowed. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, the post was reoccupied by members of Henry McCulloch's Mounted Rifles in the fall of 1861, when the site was used by the Confederate forces as a temporary prisoner-of-war camp. The soldiers imprisoned in the fort's barracks were members of one of the six companies (B, E, F, H, I, and K) of the 8th Regiment of Infantry US that had been surrendered at the Battle of Adams Hill, north of San Antonio, on May 9, 1861. Fort McKavett remained a prisoner-of-war camp until the late spring of 1862, when the prisoners were transferred to Hempstead (near Houston) and then on to Camp Ford in Tyler, Texas. Elements of McCulloch's troops and members of the 31st Brigade of Texas State Troops then used the fort as a base of operations until the end of the war. During the war, the fort was occupied by a few families left on the frontier despite Indians raiding at will. The fort was reactivated on April 1, 1868, as part of \\"the redeployment of a frontier military force\\", by Brevet L. Col. Eugene B. Beaumont's 4th Cavalry A Company, who found the conditions of the old fort \\"deplorable\\". Col. George A. Gordon assumed command on April 10, 1868, just before the arrival of Company F and Companies D, E, and I of the 38th Infantry. Camp followers formed a town a mile north of the post. It was supposed to be named after a German merchant by the surname of Lehne, but went by the unfortunate name of \\"Scabtown\\". The historic site itself is located 23 miles west of Menard. Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie assumed command of the 38th Infantry, of Buffalo Soldiers, on 15 March 1869, with Lt. Col. William R. Shafter as his aide. On September 1, 1869, the 38th was combined with the 41st to create the 24th Infantry under Mackenzie. Sergeant Emanuel Stance received the Medal of Honor after leading 10 troopers of the 9th Cavalry against Indians at Kickapoo Springs on May 20, 1870. Mackenzie assumed command of Fort Concho on 15 February 1871. As in other places in the Reconstruction Era South, the fort and nearby Scabtown experienced racial tensions and violence, notably the notorious murders of three black soldiers by prosperous local rancher John M. \\"Humpy\\" Jackson and accomplices, none of whom were ever convicted by civilian authorities.Referenced in \\"The Post on the San Saba\\", \\"Texas Beyond History\\", published by University of Texas at Austin, College of Liberal Arts The writer Robert E. Howard, a Texas history enthusiast, visited Fort McKavett some 60 years later and found local inhabitants still recalling these events‚Äîthough in a biased and exaggerated version: \\"The arrogance of the Negro soldiers led to a fierce and bloody war between the fort and the inhabitants of the country, in which the [white] natives had the best of it. (...) Federal soldiers found their most dangerous enemies not to be Commanches\\" (emphasis in the original).Robert E. Howard's 1933 letters to H.P. Lovecraft and August Derleth, published by Glenn Lord in \\"The Howard Collector\\", Ace Books, 1979, P. 174, 176. The fort was connected by telegraph to Fort Concho, Fredericksburg, and San Antonio in 1875. The trail of Captain Nicholas M. Nolan's deserters associated with his Llano Estacado disastrous reconnaissance mission took place at the fort on September 27, 1877. The 16th Infantry, under Col. Galusha Pennypacker, arrived in March 1881, and the regiment closed the fort for good on June 30, 1883‚Äîbut with the Indian threat gone, residents stayed‚Äîunlike the previous closing.Parent, Laurence. Official Guide to Texas State Parks. University of Texas Press, Austin. 4th printing, 2005. p 72. By the mid-1890s, the community had 80 citizens, a weekly paper, and two hotels. In 1904, the school had 28 students and two teachers. By the 1920s, Fort McKavett's population was about 150; it fell to 136 during the years of the Great Depression and stayed at that level until the 1960s. From a reported 103 in the '70s, it declined to a mere 45 by 1990. Restoration Restoration of the fort began in 1968, when the old school and one of the barracks were acquired and were under the control of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The restoration continued, and by 1990, 17 buildings had been restored. On January 1, 2008, Fort McKavett was transferred from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to the Texas Historical Commission.

In 2016, the Yorkshire announced it would replace the Barnsley Building Society brand with its own; closing six branches and rebranding the remainder under its own brand.  History  Originally called the Barnsley Permanent Benefit Building Society, it operated from an office above a grocers shop before moving to purpose built premises at the corner of Regent Street and Royal Street in the town centre. During this period many rival terminating societies emerged as were the norm at the time, but due to its permanent nature the society began to dominate the local market for saving and mortgages. By the 1890s the society had opened branches at both Clayton West and Mexborough and saving balances started to grow more quickly. The society started to operate in several other locations around the area including temporary branches in church halls and schools in order to make saving more available for the working classes. The society opened its head office at Permanent Building on the corner of Regent Street and Church Street, Barnsley, in 1938. The newly built head office was opened by Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood who at the time was president of the Yorkshire county association of building societies. By the 1950s the society's assets were strong and 15 branches existed, spreading from Blackpool in Lancashire to Dartford in Kent. During the 1970s the society rejected opportunities for possible mergers with the South Yorkshire BS and the Elsecar, Hoyland and Wentworth Saving society who were smaller local societies that were looking for merger partners. During the late 1970s, increased competition from other expanding societies such as the Halifax and the Bradford and Bingley meant that the Barnsley lost ground, and by one stage in the 1980s, the society had contracted to a single Barnsley office and maintained part-time agencies at Wombwell and Mexborough due to increased competition and regulation. Barnsley Building Society, Wakefield. After an influence of more modern thinking and helped by the 1986 act which lifted many hurdles it faced with competing with retail banks, it soon recovered and branches were re-opened at Wombwell and Mexborough. Offices at Royston and Hemsworth soon followed but these were short lived and closed in 1989. During the early 1990s the society expanded once again and new branches were opened in Wakefield, Rotherham and Chesterfield. In 2001 the society's Wombwell and Mexborough offices were re- located to better premises and the Wombwell branch was refurbished shortly afterwards in 2006, during which period the society operated from a temporary location in Wombwell council offices. During the mid-1990s the society opened a second Barnsley office in the town's Alhambra Centre. Also during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, the society carried out a rapid agency expansion programme and agencies were opened throughout Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire as well as more local sites such as Wath, Royston and Penistone, but due to increased costs and declining retail funding these agencies were closed in early 2006. In 2004 it was decided to merge the Church street and Alhambra branches and the society opened a new flagship branch on Cheapside, a prime location within Barnsley town centre. =Merger with the Yorkshire Building Society= In October 2008, the society announced that it expected to lose up to ¬£10 million which it had deposited with Icelandic banks. In order to mitigate the situation, the Yorkshire Building Society agreed to take it over by the end of the year. The merger completed on 31 December 2008, at which point Barnsley Building Society became a trading name of Yorkshire Building Society. The Yorkshire expressed a desire to keep the Barnsley brand alive and run its eight branches as a separate trading brand; this being welcomed by many former Barnsley members and Barnsley staff. The merger was however somewhat controversial as several members of the FSA believed the merger was unnecessary as the Barnsley had substantial reserves to cover the losses. The board of the Barnsley however believed that in the uncertain times caused by the credit crunch the Barnsley's members would be better served by merging with the Yorkshire building Society. The Barnsley, despite its expected losses, was still a valuable commodity and it was rumoured several other societies were interested due to the Barnsley's strong mortgage book and funding streams which were in place without excessive lending from the money markets. At the time of the merger, the society had 8 branches located at Barnsley, Cudworth, Chesterfield, Doncaster, Mexborough, Rotherham, Wakefield, and Wombwell as well as its Regent Street Head office. It was the 34th largest in the United Kingdom based on total assets of ¬£376 million as at 31 December 2007Building Societies Association ‚Äì Asset List (PDF File) and was a member of the Building Societies Association. In January 2016, it was announced that the Barnsley brand will be phased out by July. Six branches would be closed, with those that remain open being rebranded under the Yorkshire brand.

Because the dancer is front and center in a flamenco performance, foreigners often assume the dance is the most important aspect of the art form - but in fact, it is the cante which is the heart and soul of the genre. A cante singer is a cantaor or cantaora. The cante flamenco is part of musical tradition in the Andalusian region of Spain. Its origins are uncertain but scholars see many influences in the cante flamenco including: The traditional song of the gitanos (Spanish Gypsies), the Perso-Arab Zyriab song form, the classical Andalusian orchestras of the Islamic Empire, the Jewish synagogue chants, Mozarabic forms such as zarchyas and zambra, Arabic zayal (the foundation for the Fandango), and Andalusian regional folk forms, as well as West African and South American influences as seen in the cantes de ida y vuelta. Flamenco developed into its definitive form during its Golden Age (1869-1910). Beginning in 1910, cante flamenco was popularized by the opera flamenca which included the lighter forms of flamenco such as fandangos and cantes de ida y vuelta. In order to preserve the \\"authentic\\" cante jondo (deep song), Manuel de Falla and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, organized the Concurso de Cante Jondo in Granada in 1922. Singers from all over Andalusia travelled to join in the competition. The first two prizes went to El Tenazas and El Caracol. Types of Cante There are many variants of cantes or palos (song forms), each expressing a unique emotion (which shares noticeable resemblance to Indian classical music). The flamenco songs of today may be classified into one of three categories: cante grande, cante intermedio or cante chico. =Cante Grande= Also known as cante jondo and sometimes referred to as cante gitano. Meaning \\"profound\\" and \\"deep,\\" this intensely sad form of cante deals with themes of death, anguish, despair, or religious sentiments and may be sung a palo seco (without guitar accompaniment). Major forms are the\\"ton√°s, martinetes, seguiriya, sole√°, and carcelera. It is said that cante jondo (deep song) is the heart and soul of flamenco: Sample Seguiria describing anguish in Cal√≥, Spanish and English: =Cante Intermedio= Meaning \\"intermediate,\\" this form is less profound but also moving, sometimes containing an oriental cast to the music. The term (between cante chico and cante grande that is) varies according to who is singing and describing the \\"cante intermedio\\". =Cante Chico= Literally meaning \\"little song,\\" this form of cante sings of lighter subjects including love, bawdy humor and happiness to the accompaniment of the flamenco guitar. Festive forms of cante chico include forms such as the alegr√≠as, buler√≠as and tangos. Other classifications of cante flamenco=Cante Gitano= Cante gitano (or the \\"Gypsy song\\") refers to the original songs believed to be developed by Gypsies who immigrated in the 15th century. These include the ton√°, sole√°, seguiriya, tango and buleria. =Cante Andaluz= Cante andaluz began to spread during the middle of the 19th century, and is a combination of other forms of folkloric music from Andalusia which demonstrate a definite influence of Gypsy flamenco music. Cante andaluz genres include the many variations of the fandango and cantinas. =Cantes Folkl√≥ricos Aflamencados= The styles of cantes folkl√≥ricos aflamencados are forms of cante that are not considered to be true forms of flamenco by the purists. Examples of these styles include the sevillanas, Farruca, Garrotin, and the Cuban Rumba. These are the folk song and dances from Andalusia, other Spanish provinces including Galicia and Asturias, as well as South America which have been slightly influenced by traditional flamenco forms. = Lorque√±a = Lorque√±a is a \\"aflamencado\\" that has been made from certain ancient folk songs based on the poems of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. The poet himself collected these folk songs that were included gypsies and flamenco lyrics and gathered in his collection of ancient popular songs. Among these traditional songs were the tunes, buler√≠as, jaleos and seguidillas that Lorca himself recorded in 1931 accompanying the famous singer \\"La Argentinita\\" with the piano. The lorque√±a comes from Granada and is based on the buler√≠a style. The gypsy Pastora Mar√≠a Pav√≥n Cruz known as \\"La Ni√±a de los Peines\\" was a very famous cantaora flamenca from Seville. She took the poems of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca as lyrics of new songs and was the first person to call it Lorque√±a.  Titles  *En el caf√© de Chinitas ('At Chinitas Cafe') *Anda jaleo ('Come Rise Up') *Esquilones de Plata ('Silver Bells') Famous Cantadores=El Planeta (Antonio Fernandez)= Although concrete information about El Planeta is scarce, it is thought he was born around 1770 in Cadiz. He is widely acknowledged as the first famous performer of the cante flamenco. Originally a blacksmith, El Planeta soon became a renowned leader within the Gypsy community, bearing the honorary title of \\"Count and Prince of the Fraternity.\\" It is believed he usually sang unaccompanied, although he sometimes accompanied himself on the guitar. The oldest siguiriyas in recorded flamenco history are those of El Planeta. He died around 1850, most likely in or around Seville. =El Fillo (Francisco Ortega Vargas)= Born around 1820 in Villa Real, El Fillo was the chosen disciple of El Planeta. El Fillo was able to perform all forms of cante, and has thus been known as \\"the father of cante.\\" His hoarse, harsh voice has become a defining characteristic of cante to this day - this style of singing is described as afilla in homage to him. It is believed that El Fillo died in 1878 in Seville. =Silverio Franconetti Aguilar= Born 1829, Silverio Franaconnetti was born in Mor√≥n de la Frontera was expected to enter the family tailoring business, but would escape to the nearby blacksmith to hear the gypsy singers. Here he met El Fillo and was encouraged to become a singer. He later went to Argentina and Uruguay working as a picador in the bullrings, and he also served as an officer in the Uruguay Army. Franconnetti was arguably the best non-Gypsy singer of the Nineteenth Century. He died in 1889. =La Ni√±a De Los Peines (Pastora Maria Pavon Cruz)= Born in Seville in 1890, La Ni√±a de Los Peines is regarded by some as the most exceptional and innovative female flamenco singer of all time. Affectionately called \\"La Ni√±a,\\" she was known for her interpretation of the tangos, and was often requested to sing siguiriyas at a time when women did not customarily perform it. =Manolo Caracol (Manuel Ortega Juarez)= Manolo Caracol came from an exalted Gypsy dynasty which to this day remains legendary in the arenas of both flamenco and bullfighting. Born in Seville in 1909, it is commonly believed that his ancestral lineage included both El Planeta and El Fillo. Caracol won the prestigious first prize at the Cante Jondo Competition (in 1922) at the age of only 13. During the Spanish Civil War he worked in theaters to survive. Caracol claimed his style of singing was unique. He is remembered for his capacity to evoke overwhelming passions from his listeners. Caracol frequently performed with full orchestras or pianos (much to the harsh remarks made by the purists). Caracol died at the age of sixty-four in 1973 Madrid. =Camar√≥n de la Isla (Jos√© Monje Cruz)= Camar√≥n de la Isla was born in San Fernando in 1950, and was the second child of eight to a Gypsy blacksmith and a basketweaver. He received his nickname Camar√≥n (Shrimp) early on due to his thin body, light complexion and blond hair, and began performing at the age of eight. In 1969 he made his first album with Paco de Luc√≠a. Although trained as a traditional flamenco singer, Camar√≥n broke with convention, incorporating new musical instruments including the drums, zither, flute, moog, and keyboards to name a few. In his comparatively short career of 20 years, he and Paco de Luc√≠a revolutionized the art of flamenco, attracting vast new audiences to the art form. Camar√≥n met his untimely death in 1992 at the age of forty-one, in Barcelona. =Other Famous Singers of Cante= There are many more famous and very influential flamenco singers, including: *Manuel Agujetas *La Repompa de Malaga *Rafael de Utrera *Potito *Remedios Amaya *Diego Carrasco *La Paquera de Jerez *Antonio Mairena *Diego El Cigala *Enrique El Mellizo *Antonio Chacon *Manuel Torre *Enrique El Granaino *Pepe de Luc√≠a *Estrella Morente *Lola Flores (some do not consider her a flamenco singer, although she did sing) *Fosforito *Lebrijano *La Perla de Cadiz *Terremoto de Jerez *El Chocolate *Manolo Leiva *Duquende *Pepe Marchena *Chano Lobato *Jos√© Merc√© (who, like Camar√≥n, started singing flamenco and then added new elements) *Antonio Molina *Ni√±a Pastori *Mayte Mart√≠n *Juan Valderrama *Rocio Jurado See also *Glossary of flamenco terms *Federico Garcia Lorca *Flamenco Chill *Flamenco guitar *Paco de Luc√≠a *Palo (flamenco) *New Flamenco *Spanish translation in the Golden Age *:Category:Andalusian music ReferencesSources *ALVAREZ CABALLERO, Angel: Historia del Cante Flamenco, Alianza Editorial, Madrid, 1981. *GARCIA LORCA, Federico: In Search of Duende.

Description A. aphylla is spiny and leafless erect and widely branching shrub that grows to in height and with a width of approximately . The generally bright green branchlets are rigid, terete and obscurely ribbed. They are smooth, glaucous, glabrous and coarsely pungent. Unlike most Acacia the phyllodes are absent for A. aphylla'. The thickened blue-green wiry stems have the ability to photosynthesize like leaves so giving the plant an evolutionary adaptation that greatly reduces the total surface area for water loss through transpiration. A. aphylla produces yellow spherical flowers between August and October (late winter to mid spring) in its native range. The inflorescences have a simple structure with one per axil. The peduncles are long and glabrous with globular heads. Theyhold 20‚Äì30 flowers that are a bright light golden colour. The flowers are 5-merous with free sepals. Seed-pods form later that are linear, long and wide containing black seeds that are longitudinal and oblong and about long. Pods are mature from December to March. Plants are mostly killed by fire but populations will regenerate from the soil seedbank. Range The shrub has a restricted range and is only found in two areas in the Darling Range about apart from each other. The areas are both to the east of Perth with one population being found in Hidden Valley area in the Helena River and the other south of Northam in the Clackline Nature Reserve. The exact placement of each population is being withheld by the state government for conservation reasons. Ecology A. aphylla is commonly found in open forest communities that are dominated by Eucalyptus marginata and Eucalyptus calophylla, or in woodlands where Eucalyptus loxophleba dominates. Species commonly found in the understorey include Grevillea endlicheriana, Hakea petiolaris, and Xanthorrhoea preissii. It is generally associated with areas of with laterite and granite outcrops on hillsides, and will grow in rock crevices. It is mostly found to grow in soils that are sandy, loam, clay, or gravel and brown or yellow in colour. Cultivation A. aphylla is cultivated as a foliage plant, although it is actually a succulent and is adapted to harsh conditions. It grows fast, requires well-drained soils and will tolerate full sun. It can be pruned following flowering and pruning can be harsh, back to approximately from the ground. Regrowth will take place in the next couple of months. It is both drought and frost tolerant can be grown from seed. It produces an abundance of seed during summer which stores well and remains viable for many years. It regenerates poorly in habitat and often there are few or no seedlings to be found. When cultivated, the hard black seeds need to be soaked for 24 hours, with initially boiled hot water, to soften the coating, which usually gives a consistent and early germination of seeds. History The species was first described the species in the journal Nuytsia by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 1974. The name ‚Äòaphylla‚Äô in Latin means without leaves, due to the absence of phyllodes. A. aphylla was recorded as rare in 1950 and after 1992 it was listed as vulnerable then became protected under the Endangered species Protection Act 1992.

It is also known as the blue crown or war crown. New Kingdom pharaohs are often depicted wearing it in battle, but it was also frequently worn in ceremonies.e.g. My≈õliwiec, Karol, Eros on the Nile, Cornell University Press 2004, p.14 It used to be called a war crown by many, but modern historians refrain from defining it thus.Kuhrt, Am√©lie, The Ancient Near East: C.3000‚Äì330 B.C., Taylor & Francis 1995, p.190 No original example of a khepresh has yet been found. Based on ancient artistic representations, some Egyptologists have speculated that the khepresh was made of leather or stiffened clothMaisels, Charles Keith, Early Civilizations of the Old World, Routledge 2001, p.60 covered with a precise arrangement of hundreds of sequins, discs, bosses, or rings. Given that the deshret (red crown) and hedjet (white crown) were apparently woven of some sort of plant fiber, the circles or rings decorating ancient artistic representations of the khepresh may instead indicate the regular array of hexagonal holes in an open triaxial weave. As with many other royal crowns, a uraeus (cobra) was hooked to the front of the khepresh. History The Blue Crown, or War Crown, was represented in hieroglyphs. The earliest known mention of the khepresh is on the stela Cairo JE 59635 [CG 20799] which dates to the reign of pharaoh Neferhotep III, during the Second Intermediate Period.Edwards, Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen; Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri√®re Hammond, Cyril John Gadd, The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press 1975, p.51 In this and other examples from the same era, the word is written with a determinative that represents the cap crown, a lower and less elaborate type of crown. Images of the khepresh from the reign of Ahmose I, first king of the New Kingdom and the Eighteenth Dynasty, show a headdress that is taller than the cap crown and more angular than later forms of the khepresh. This crown continued to evolve during the early Eighteenth Dynasty, attaining its best-known form in the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.Davies, W.

However, some scholars think that the crown was also meant to evoke the divine power of the pharaoh, and was thereby worn to religiously situate kings as manifestations of gods on earth.Bryan, Betsy. \\"A 'New' Statue of Amenhotep III and the Meaning of the Khepresh Crown.\\" The Archaeology and Art of Ancient Egypt: Studies in Honor of David O'Connor, ed.

Following his brother's death Ada's younger son William became King of Scots at the age of twenty three. William the Lion was to become the longest serving King of Scots to that date, serving until 1214. =Church patronage= Religious houses were established in Haddington at an early date. They came to include the Blackfriars (who came into Scotland in 1219) and most notably the Church of the Greyfriars, or Minorites (came into Scotland in the reign of Alexander II), which would become famous as \\"Lucerna Laudoniae\\"- The Lamp of Lothian, the toft of land upon which it stands being granted by King David I of Scotland to the Prior of St. Andrews (to whom the patronage of the church of Haddington belonged).

Scarborough Building Society was formed in May 1846 - It was a member of the Building Societies Association. On 30 March 2009 the building society merged with the Skipton Building Society and now operates under the Skipton brand.Merger with Scarborough Building Society Skipton Building Society History The Society was founded as 'The Scarborough and North and East Yorkshire Permanent Building and Investment Society' and it wasn't until 1903 that the current name was adopted. The Society's initial objectives were to provide a safe haven for investors' money - and the finance to enable people to build or buy their own homes. The original investment rate was 5% and the first mortgage was for ¬£120. In 1939 the Society opened its first Head Office, when York House was built in York Place, Scarborough, providing both office accommodation and a full branch. York Place remained in the business as a branch until 2006 when Scarborough's premier town centre branch was relocated to the former Burger King store in Westborough. The first Scarborough Building Society out of town branch was opened in Bridlington in 1955, and from then onwards new branches were opened throughout Yorkshire and into Teesside and the East Midlands. The present 9-strong branch network continues to be a central part of its expanding business. Prospect House (Head Office) Direct postal and telephone services were embraced in the early 1990s and the Investments Direct Service was created in 1991, taking the Scarborough investment brand to the whole of the United Kingdom. In 1998 direct service for mortgages was formalised with the opening of a Direct Mortgage Centre. The assets now exceed ¬£2.8 billion, making it the 17th largest building society in the UK. In July 2008 Scarborough Building Society announced the appointment of Robin Litten as its new Chief Executive, to replace John Carrier who retires from the post on 31 December 2008.

On 3 November 2008, Skipton and Scarborough Building Societies announced their intended merger in a joint statement: \\"This is a real opportunity for the two North Yorkshire-based societies to create an enlarged Society that is even better placed to deal with any future uncertainties in the financial marketplace. The two societies are well matched, having similar business models, a strong geographical fit and shared commitment to mutuality, their members, their people and their local communities. \\"Scarborough Building Society has seen difficult trading conditions leading to a substantial impact on profit and a resultant weakening capital position. In addition, the board of Scarborough has considered the possible impacts of continuing house price falls and the impending recession in the UK, and has concluded that the effect would be an unacceptable reduction in its capital resources and that, to fully protect the interests of its members, it should approach Skipton Building Society as its preferred merger partner\\". David Cutter will become chief executive of the enlarged Society, which will be called Skipton Building Society and will be headquartered at The Bailey, Skipton. As previously announced, the current chief executives of both societies, John Goodfellow and John Carrier, will continue with their planned retirements on 31 December 2008. The enlarged Society is now the fifth largest building society with approximately 860,000 members and over ¬£16 billion of assets. During the take over, all employees from the original Scarborough Build Society were made redundant and the headquarters was moved to Skipton.

Background Zdravkoviƒá was born in Belgrade in the family of a railroad clerk Du≈°an and his wife ≈Ωivka, n√©e Stani≈°iƒá. He never knew his mother who died only six months after his birth under somewhat mysterious circumstances. His father, a quiet and diligent man who worked hard to support his family, never discussed ≈Ωivka's death with his son. (One version of this tragic event describes ≈Ωivka setting the fire to a stove where her husband had previously hidden a hand grenade brought for the battle field). Thus, Gika spent his early childhood in Kru≈°evac raised by his paternal grandparents while his father was fighting in the Great War and later taken into the German captivity. He returned to Belgrade at the age of four when his father remarried soon after the World War I. His stepmother Jelisaveta was a kind woman who never made any difference between Gika and her own children, son and daughter, from the previous marriage. Gika was educated in Belgrade, first in elementary school Tsar Uro≈° and later in the Fourth Boys Grammar School where his headmaster was Momƒçilo Nastasijeviƒá, famous writer. Nastasijeviƒá's brother Svetomir was a well known composer and they both knew that Gika was attending two schools - general grammar and music school. More importantly they both supported the ambition of the young man. He started playing the oboe at the age of 13, \\"by chance\\" according to his own testimony: \\"Nobody in my surroundings had anything to do with music. As a matter of fact I think that music had no place whatsoever in my home... My father had quite a different idea about my upbringing and future career. He did not believe that Parcae had been on my side. As far as I was concerned, I truly believed more in ancient mythology and Homer. I have always thought that a man can influence the faith by pure will. I trusted my love for music and longed to discover its magical world. I cannot remember though any particular moment when I discovered that love for music. I only know that, as a small boy, I could stand for hours at the fences of Belgrade restaurants listening to the music coming from the inside. I truly can't say how eventually I found myself in a music school. I simply wanted it. Unlike the general grammar school I equally attended at the time, all courses at the music school came easy and natural... Once I had to choose the main course at the school, I had been hesitating between clarinet, flute and oboe until one day when I found out that a musician wanted to sell his oboe. My father bought me the instrument despite the fact that he definitively did not want me to become a musician. He understood my than desire as a pure and temporary caprice. My first teachers were the oboist of the Belgrade Opera Orchestra and later a German musician who played the English horn. The German was a great teacher. He did not only teach me the technique, but insisted on a beautiful tone as well. I must have done well at school as entering the Music Academy Miloje Milojeviƒá wrote a sonata especially for me.

He studied Hebrew and the Talmud with Solomon Marini, author of the Tiqqun 'Olam, and with the poet Moses Catalano. His instructor in secular subjects was Bernardo de Laurentius. He was the nephew of Judah ben Samuel ha-Kohen Cantarini, also a physician and rabbi of Padua. Biography Cantarini was born in Padua, where he received his diploma as physician on February 11, 1664. In addition to following the profession of medicine, he often preached in synagogues. His sermons were frequently attended by Christians, the number of these on one occasion being so great that the Jews had to find seats in the women's gallery. He also taught in the yeshiva, and officiated as cantor, especially on the Day of Atonement. As he had a thorough knowledge of the Talmud, his decisions were often sought in halakic cases. Cantarini had an extensive medical practice, especially among the patricians outside Padua, but at the end of his life, having lost his property through others, he was in straitened circumstances. He died in Padua. Many elegies were written in his memory, among others by his pupil Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (Venice, 1728). His Style In his poetical writings Cantarini based his language almost exclusively on that of the Bible; his sentences containing, in addition to innumerable conceits, allusions to Biblical expressions. The contents of his works must be judged apart from their unpleasing form, being remarkable for pithy sense and elegant definition. The most important of his Hebrew works is Pachad Yitzchaq (The Fear of Isaac), a description of the attack on the ghetto at Padua by the Christian populace on August 20, 1684, published at Amsterdam in 1685. This work contains a detailed account of all the incidents, in most of which he had taken part (Otzar Nechmad, iii. 131); and many documents of the governments of Padua and Venice are therein translated and quoted in Hebrew. An account of the internal condition of the Jewish community, together with statistics, serves as an introduction (p. 10). The author develops entirely modern theories on the causes of these occurrences in the political as well as the physical world (5a et seq.). Noteworthy also is his decided tolerance toward Christians. (See, for instance, pp. 9a, 23g). His Poems The following poems were published by Cantarini; they are nearly all occasional: Pi Sefarim (Mouth of Books), festal songs written when the teachers of the yeshivah decided to include the study of the treatise of Chullin (Venice, 1669). A poem in the form of a psalm, on the delivery of the community from the hands of the populace August 20, 1684, is printed in the Pachad Yitzchaq (p. 51b), which was formerly read every year in the synagogue on the anniversary of the attack (10 Elul). Other poems are printed in his works ‚ÄòEqeb Rab and ‚ÄòEt Qetz (see below), and in the prefaces to the Kebunnat Abraham of Abraham Cohen, and the Ma'aseh Tobiah of Tobias Cohen. Cantarini also wrote a paraphrase of the majority of the Psalms. Many of his poems in manuscript were in Ghirondi's possession. Some of his poems have also been inscribed on the walls of the large Ashkenazic synagogue of Padua, which was built during his life. His ‚ÄòEt Qetz (Time of the End) deals with the time of the advent of the Messiah (Amsterdam, 1710), while the ‚ÄòEqeb Rab (Great Consequence), is a collection of responsa in Hebrew and Italian, concerning the oath which the tax-collectors of the community of Padua took before the wardens (Venice, 1711). The manuscript of his Leb Chakam (Heart of the Wise) was in Ghirondi's possession. His Chayye Besarim (Physical Life), Leb Marpeh (Healing Heart), and Shibat Tishbi (Reply to the Tishbite), a polemic against Elijah Levita's Tishbi were not printed before the twentieth century. Cantarini's Hebrew letters, addressed to the Christian scholar Unger of Silesia, are interesting as containing notices on the Jewish writers of Italy. Halakic responsa of his are printed in Isaac Lampronti's Pachad Yitzchaq and in Simson Morpurgo's Shemesh Tzedaqah. Latin Works In Latin Cantarini wrote the Vindex Sanguinis, a reply to the work on blood accusation of Jacob Geuze (Amsterdam, 1681). Three Latin letters by him have also been published; one of them dealing with natural history, is addressed to his teacher Bernardo de Laurentius (Padua, 1856, ed. Osimo). An Italian responsum of his is mentioned (translated into Hebrew in Isaac Lampronti's Pachad Yitzchaq). Many of his Italian sermons in manuscript were in Ghirondi's possession. There have also been preserved several consulti (partly in Latin) on medical subjects (Otzar Nechmad, iii. 148).

Its common names include kangaroo acacia, kangaroo thorn, prickly wattle, hedge wattle and paradox acacia. Description The large shrub or tree up to tall and has a similar width, it has ribbed branchlets that are often arched downward. It is dense with foliage; the leaves are actually enlarged petioles known as phyllodes. They are crinkly and the new ones are covered in hairs. The erect phyllodes are asymettric and have a lanceolate shape and are around in length and wide. The bush is also full of long spines. It usually flowers between August and November producing an axillary flower-spike with small, bright yellow spherical flower heads and the fruits are brown pods long. The hard black seeds within have an oblong shape and are about in length and half as wide. The spiny stipules that grow at the base of the phyllodes deter livestock from feeding on or too close to the plant. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1813 as part of the work Catalogus Plantarum Horti Botanici Monspeliensis. The species name is from the Greek words para which means near and doxa meaning glory. This probably refers the unattractive and thorny shrub being quite showy when it is in bloom. Many synonyms are known for the plant including; Acacia ornithophora, Acacia undulata, Mimosa paradoxa, Racosperma paradoxum, Acacia armata and Acacia hybrida. Distribution Kangaroo thorn is widely spread across Australia, regenerating from seed after disturbances, such as bush fire. Small birds, including wrens, use this plant as shelter and dwelling, while it is relied upon as a food source for moths, butterflies and other insects, birds also feed on its seeds. It is endemic to south eastern parts of South Australia, much of Victoria, eastern New South Wales and south eastern parts of Queensland. It has become naturalised in parts of Western Australia and Tasmania. The plant has also been introduced to other continents. In the United States, kangaroo thorn is a well-known noxious weed in California. Cultivation The plant is used as an ornamental or as a dense screening plant. It make an excellent habitat and food source for birds. It grows well in full sun or in a partly shaded position. It can be planted in dry to moist well-drained areas. Seeds require pre-treatment such as scarification prior to planting.

He was director and conductor of the Zagreb Opera, Belgrade Opera and professor at the Belgrade Music Academy. In the spirit of a kind of Slavic expressionism, also seen in the works of Jan√°ƒçek and some of the 19th century Russian masters, Baranoviƒá was better than any other Croatian composer of his time in overcoming the discrepancy between the national and the universal to be seen in Croatian interwar music. Biography From 1908 to 1912 Baranoviƒá was studying music in Zagreb. He took private lessons from Dragutin (Carlo) Kaiser and then in the school of the Croatian Music Institute where he studied horn with Fran Lhotka. After that, he went to the Music Academy in Vienna (1912-1914) and later that in Berlin (1921-1922). From 1915 to 1943 he was the conductor of the Croatian National Theatre Opera in Zagreb (and the director of it from 1929 to 1940); at that time it went through one of its finest periods. In the season 1927/28, he was also conductor for the Anna Pavlova ballet troupe on her European tour, and was long-term conductor of the Lisinski Choir. After leaving Zagreb in the first years of the war he was imprisoned in the Stara Gradi≈°ka camp, and then for some time was conductor of the Bratislava Radio Orchestra (1943) as well as being the director of the Bratislava Opera (1945-1946). From 1946 to 1964 he was teacher of conducting and orchestration at the Music Academy in Belgrade, and from 1951 to 1961 director and conductor of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra. From 1954, he was a fellow of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb. Oeuvre In the spirit of a kind of Slavic expressionism, also seen in the works of Jan√°ƒçek and some of the 19th century Russian masters, Baranoviƒá was better than any other Croatian composer of his time in overcoming the discrepancy between the national and the universal to be seen in Croatian interwar music. In his valuable works the ballet Gingerbread Heart (1924), the song cycle From My Hills (to verses of Fran Galoviƒá, 1927) and in the comic opera Sheared-Mown (1932) he drew the authenticity of his idiom from the folk music of Hrvatsko zagorje, the foundation of an artistic transformation of Stravinskyan dimensions. A wonderful master of instrumentation, with a marked feeling for rhythmical structure and a special sense for humour, even of the coarsely grotesque (the ballet Imbrek with a Nose, 1935), Baranoviƒá sidestepped the restorer‚Äôs gesture of neo-Classicism, widening the ranges of inherited expressiveness, particularly in terms of harmony. While Baranoviƒá‚Äôs works after 1943 ‚Äì the orchestral poems From Solitude (to his own words, 1944) and Clouds (verses of Dobri≈°a Cesariƒá, 1963) more thoroughly set free dissonant harmonic sets, his larger vocal and instrumental works of the 1960s and 1970s do nevertheless pay a tribute to the simplifications enjoined by the aesthetics of what was called engaged realism. As symphonic and particularly operatic conductor, Baranoviƒá much enriched reproductive practice. He was the first in Croatia to conduct a performance of Mussorgsky‚Äôs Boris Godunov in 1918 and Shostakovich‚Äôs Katerina Izmailova in 1937, and was the first to put the most important ballets of Stravinsky on the Zagreb stage, the first outside Czechoslovakia to put on Smetana‚Äôs Libu≈°e. He paid a lot of attention to first performances of the most important music theatre works of Croatian composers.

Stroud & Swindon Building Society operated through a branch network of 22 offices and 22 agencies in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Monmouthshire, Devon and Cornwall complemented by a contact centre based in Gloucester. Stroud & Swindon was a provider of both mortgages and savings, as well as offering loans, credit cards and insurance.  History  Former headquarters of the Stroud & Swindon in Rowcroft, Stroud Stroud and Swindon Building Society was originally established in 1850 as the Stroud Provident Benefit Building Society. The first head office was in Rowcroft in Stroud where the offices of Winterbothams solicitors are now and, indeed, Lyndsey Winterbotham was the first Chairman. After transferring for a period to larger premises in Russell Street, the Society moved in 1990 to a purpose built head office, less than away from the original location. Over the years a series of acquisitions of other societies including the Bristol Permanent Building Society and the Frome and Selwood Building Society saw the Stroud Building Society develop and grow. Merger with the Swindon Permanent Building Society in 1986 led to the change of title of Stroud & Swindon.  Community Support  Stroud & Swindon supported non-profit events and voluntary groups located within its region. Donations or assistance tended to be on a one-off basis and in order to make its support as effective as possible it focused on projects in areas where it had branches and could make the most impact. The Society had 22 branches based in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset and Monmouthshire and each branch nominated their own local charity to support for the year. It also supported a number of other local charities which met its overall criteria as well as some major national events such as BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief. Stroud & Swindon also developed affinity savings accounts with Bath RFC, Forest Green Rovers F.C., The Willow Trust and The Cotswold Care Hospice. Merger with the Coventry Building Society Like most of the society's 22 branches, the Melksham office was identified by a distinctive blue, red and white shingle and fascia The Stroud & Swindon merged with the Coventry Building Society on 1 September 2010 following an announcement on 23 March and the approval of members on 16 June. The Stroud and Swindon name continued for a year as a separate and distinct brand. However, the head office functions transferred to Coventry immediately. The former Stroud & Swindon Building Society is now fully integrated with the Coventry.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 4, 2007. The episode parodies The Da Vinci Code. \\"Fantastic Easter Special\\" was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA LV in the United States. Determined to get the real story behind why he has to decorate eggs for Easter, Stan starts asking his Dad some tough questions. The answers lead to an ancient and mysterious secret society created in the Middle Ages to protect the secret of the Easter Bunny. Threats to the sanctity of Easter are imminent from Bill Donohue and the Catholic League. Plot As the Marsh family colors eggs for Easter, Stan questions what it has to do with Jesus. Not satisfied by his father Randy's vague response, Stan storms off and asks the same question to a mall Easter Bunny. The mall bunny tells Stan that it is \\"just Easter\\", and to \\"just go with it\\", then makes a mysterious phone call. Stan soon finds himself being chased by men in bunny suits. When he gets home, he finds that Randy is part of the plot. Randy calls the men off, and tells Stan that he is in a society called \\"The Hare Club for Men\\", who have guarded the secret of Easter for generations. Randy takes Stan to the headquarters of the Hare Club, where he is to be initiated into the group, which reveres a rabbit named Snowball. The Hare Club for Men's building resembles a Masonic Hall. Much of the ritual borrows from the practice of Freemasons. Just as he is about to learn the secret of Easter, Stan's initiation is interrupted as the club is ambushed by a group of ninjas. The Hare Club members rush to protect Snowball, and Randy gives the rabbit to Stan, telling him to run. He escapes with Snowball, and witnesses the ninjas and their leader, Bill Donohue, executing a resisting hare and interrogating Randy. Stan runs off to Kyle's house and tries to extract any knowledge Kyle has of Easter. Kyle, who is Jewish and says he knows nothing about Easter, does not want to be involved in something so dangerous, but Stan persuades him to help. Stan and Kyle manage to track down a man named Professor Teabag (spoof of Professor Teabing), who supposedly knows the secret of the Hare Club. Teabag lets them in his mansion and explains that Leonardo da Vinci was actually a member of the Hare Club and that Saint Peter was not a man, but a rabbit (Peter Rabbit), and reveals that da Vinci originally portrayed Saint Peter as a rabbit instead of as a man in his painting of the Last Supper. Teabag explains that Jesus knew that no human could speak for all Christianity without any acts of corruption, and that rabbits were pure, tolerant, and incorruptible. This is why the Pope's mitre is shaped to accommodate a rabbit's ears. He also explained that the Church decided to bury the secret and put a man in charge. Ever since, \\"The Hare Club for Men\\" society members have decorated eggs for generations to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive. He further explains that Snowball is actually a descendant from St. Peter, and that Stan's father and the members of the Hare Club have been kidnapped by the Vatican, who wish to cover up this secret, viewing it as blasphemy. Donohue's ninja minions then attack again and kill Teabag's butler, but Teabag helps the two boys escape by putting marshmallow Peeps in the microwave. It causes an explosion that destroys the mansion, killing both Teabag and the ninjas. Stan and Kyle go to the Vatican where Stan turns the rabbit over to the Donohue's men, on the condition that the Hare Club members must all be set free and that Snowball remain unharmed. However, Donohue reveals he had actually made the promise on two separate crucifixes, a \\"double cross\\", and plans to make an example of the Hare Club. Pope Benedict XVI opposes this, saying that double- crossing is not considered to be \\"very Christian,\\" something which Donohue responds by saying that it is what Jesus would have wanted. Jesus himself (after resurrecting from being killed in Iraq) then arrives to intervene, answering the prayer of one of the Hare Club members. He tells them that he actually did plan for the popes to be rabbits, citing the current corruption of Donohue. Benedict and his clergy are willing to listen and agree with Jesus, but Donohue refuses to listen and orders Benedict to execute Jesus for \\"going against the Church\\". Outraged to see how arrogant Donohue is, Benedict angrily refuses, saying that killing Jesus is not \\"very Christian.\\" Enraged, Donohue seizes the Pope's mitre, and orders his ninjas to capture everyone including Benedict and Jesus. Donohue declares himself the new Pope. With the clergy unable to stop him, Donohue orders his minions to lock up Kyle and Jesus, whom he calls the \\"two Jews\\", and Benedict to deal with later. Donohue then leads Randy, Stan, and the surviving Hare Club members to the block where there is a gigantic pot for Snowball's execution. In the cell, Benedict apologizes to Jesus for his actions, pleading for forgiveness. Jesus tells Kyle that his \\"superpowers\\" only work when he is dead, and the only way to escape is for Kyle to kill him so he can return to life outside the cell. Kyle is hesitant to kill Jesus, but does so after Jesus promises that \\"Eric Cartman can never know about this\\". As Donohue is about to execute Snowball in front of Randy, Stan, and the Hare Club members, the resurrected Jesus appears in the crowd. Jesus then kills Donohue and everyone cheers for Jesus and Snowball is elected Pope. Because he is a rabbit, Snowball cannot speak or tell people how they should lead their lives, just as \\"Jesus intended\\". Stan reveals that he has learned his lesson through all of his adventures: do not ask questions; just dye the eggs and keep his mouth shut, and Randy is proud of him. Production In the commentary, the creators called it their The Da Vinci Code episode, emphasizing the conspiracy and searching for clues in the eggs. Bill Donohue had been quoted by several news outlets during coverage of previous Southpark episodes \\"Bloody Mary\\" and \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", but \\"Bill Donohue is not the emperor of Catholics.\\" Jesus then kills Donohue by throwing a Glaive (a five bladed sword in the shape of a star), similar to the one featured in the movie Krull. Reception=Critical response= IGN gave the episode a rating of 10, citing it a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"controlled comic chaos that only South Park seems able to manage on such a consistent basis.\\".IGN Episode Review In 2009, Time magazine listed the episode as #10 on their list of Top 10 Jesus Films, praising the conspiracy story and its resemblance to The Da Vinci Code and the lyrics of \\"Peter Cottontail\\" in Latin.http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/10/top-10-jesus-films/slide/south- park-fantastic-easter-special-2007/ Erik Hinton of PopMatters praised the episode saying, \\"they do like killing Jesus, but it‚Äôs in the service of a profound message of religious tolerance and even-handed treatment.\\"PopMatters, South Park Season 11 Review =Donohue's reaction= The real Donohue has a still of himself wearing the papal mitre from this episode displayed in his office. He sums up the plot as \\"In the episode, they have me overthrow the pope because the pope is a wimp, and then I take over the church and give it some guts. ... But in the end, Jesus kills me\\".

The parade has a strong superhero theme and has been the setting for a number of fictional comic book adventures. Local officials maintain that it is one of the largest and longest running Halloween parades in the United States.  History  Tom Fagan (1932‚Äì2008), a local writer and comic book fan, is credited with having a hand in the parade's early development and superhero theme. The parade began as an annual tradition in 1959; Fagan had letters and text pieces promoting the parade published in a number of DC and Marvel titles, including DC's Detective Comics #327 (May 1964) and Marvel's Avengers #88 (May 1971). According to a 2006 Boston Globe article, \\"in 1965 ... the Joker, Plastic Man, and Dr. Strange were roaming the streets of Rutland, along with Batman (presumably Fagan, but like Bruce Wayne, the Caped Crusader wouldn't divulge his identity). More comic book heroes appeared every year. ... \\" According to a 2008 Comics Buyer's Guide obituary of Fagan ... The 2006 Boston Globe story explains that \\"... Fagan was friends with many comic book authors and artists, most of whom hailed from New York. Fagan persuaded some of them to take part in the Rutland Halloween Parade in comic book character costumes. Many creators stayed as guests at Fagan's 24-room mansion outside of Rutland, which has since become the Antique Mansion Bed & Breakfast. Comic book creators known to have attended the parade over the years include Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, Marv Wolfman, Bernie Wrightson, Dennis O'Neil, Roy Thomas, Alan Weiss, Wendy and Richard Pini, Dave Cockrum, and Len Wein.  After Fagan  By the mid-2000s Fagan was no longer directly involved in the planning of the parade. The popular event continued nonetheless, with Fagan and a close personal friend of the 'inner circle', attending as a guest in 2006 and 2007, sitting with the judges. Fagan had planned to attend the parade in 2008 but died on October 21 of that year. An article eulogizing Fagan in the Rutland Herald stated \\"Without Tom, there wouldn't be a Halloween parade in Rutland. ... That's his legacy.\\" The parade celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009. Appearances in comics The Rutland Halloween Parade as portrayed in Avengers #83, by Roy Thomas, John Buscema, and Tom Palmer (Marvel Comics, Dec. 1970). In the 1970s, the Rutland Halloween Parade achieved a degree of fame when it was used as the setting of a number of superhero comic books, in titles published by industry rivals DC Comics and Marvel Comics. The first appearance of the parade was in Avengers #83, published by Marvel with a cover-date of December 1970; this was followed by DC's Batman #237, with a cover-date of December 1971. Tom Fagan was himself featured as a character in a number of stories, usually depicted as an acquaintance of the title characters. Due to the nature of the masquerade parade, these issues often saw people dressed as Marvel heroes appearing in DC publications, and vice versa, marking some of the first (unofficial) intercompany crossovers in comics. Caution was exercised, however, over widespread use of the competition's characters ‚Äî Fagan (who in real life typically hosted the parade dressed as Batman), was usually drawn as Nighthawk in Marvel-published Rutland Halloween stories. In the fall of 1972, writers Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, and Len Wein crafted a loose three-part story spanning titles from both companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein (and Wein's first wife Glynis) interacting with Fagan and Marvel or DC villains (and heroes). Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the Beast hitches a ride from Englehart, who is driving the Weins and Conway to Rutland. The story terminates after Juggernaut attempts to steal Englehart's car. The action continues in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), with Batman and other JLAers wind up leading the parade while attempting to capture Felix Faust. Faust ultimately steals Englehart's car, but is pulled over by the police. In the third part of the unofficial crossover, Thor #207 (by Conway, John Buscema, and Vince Colletta), the three comics creators (and one wife) again visit Fagan, during which visit Englehart's car is stolen by the unseen and unmentioned DC villain Felix Faust, as shown in JLA #103.Amazing Adventures #16 (Jan. 1973), Justice League of America #103 (Dec. 1972), and Thor #207 (Jan. 1973) at the Grand Comics Database In the letters page of What If? #22 (August 1980), a reader asked, \\"Does Rutland, Vermont, annually become a nexus of realities similar to that existing in the swamp near Citrusville, Florida?\\" Marvel editor Mark Gruenwald, writing as The Watcher, responded, \\"While the nexus in Citrusville is a natural aperture, the nexus near Rutland is an artificial one that fluctuates in size and accessibility. For reasons that I have not investigated, it has not been opened in recent years.\\"Gruenwald, Mark. \\"The Watcher Knows,\\" What If? #22 (Marvel, Aug. 1980). In 1986, the parade again appeared in WaRP Graphics' Thunderbunny #5. The town of Rutland was portrayed in DC's Animal Man #50 (1992), but not the Halloween parade itself. Most recently, the parade was featured in Marvel Comic's Generation X #22 (1996) and Superboy and the Ravers #16 (1997) from DC Comics.  Chronological list of appearances  note: Not all of these appearances feature the Halloween Parade.

It is part of the Color Classics series. The cartoon features Professor Grampy, a character from the Betty Boop series; this is the character's only appearance without Betty. Summary Christmas Comes But Once a Year - The Film The short begins in an orphanage, where the orphans are all asleep in the dormitory, awaiting Christmas morning. Just then, the clock chimes, a puppy in the place of the cuckoo jumps out, then slides down a ramp and licks on one of the orphans. The first orphan to wake shouts to the others, \\"Merry Christmas, everybody!\\" They all jump out of bed and make their way to the hall, singing and dancing to the title song where they grab the toys from their stockings, and get ready to play with them. However, they discover the terrible truth that the toys are old, worn and already broken when they completely fall apart when played with. The children are traumatized and burst into tears over losing them and having no other Christmas presents. Meanwhile, Professor Grampy is out riding through the snow in his outboard motor-driven sleigh, singing the title song to himself. He soon hears crying as he's passing the orphanage, so he parks the sleigh, runs to the door and peeps through the window to see the orphans wailing and tearfully heading back to their bedroom. Grampy feels distressed for them and starts to think of a way to give the orphans a better Christmas. He puts on his \\"thinking cap\\" and shortly, the lightbulb on the cap blinks, meaning he has an idea. He sneaks in through the kitchen window and starts making new toys out of household appliances, furniture, and other kitchen paraphernalia (a washboard, a roller shade, the works of an old alarm clock, etc.) While the orphans are still crying in the dormitory, Grampy dresses up as Santa Claus (with bent stovepipes as the boots, a red tablecloth as the jacket, a pillow for the weight, a strop as the belt, a picture frame as the buckle and a red purse as the hat), grabs a dinner bell, and surprises the orphans by ringing the bell and shouting, \\"Merry Christmas, everybody!\\" The orphans brighten up instantly, stop crying, and all rush out excitedly to play with their new toys. Grampy completes the scene by making a Christmas tree out of green umbrellas. He places it on top of a phonograph turntable, decorates it, gathers all the orphans together and they all sing the title song one last time. As they sing, a giant 1936 Christmas Seal stamp appears on the screen, showing Santa Claus and a \\"Holiday Greetings\\" message. Production The orphans were all animated based on a template of one of them, whose toy soldier falls through the sock. The short was directed by Dave Fleischer, it starred Jack Mercer as the voice of Grampy; it was Grampy's only appearance in which Betty Boop did not appear. Along with many of the other Color Classics, Christmas Comes But Once a Year is today in the public domain. On various video copies of the film, it is released with Hector's Hectic Life, and a few other productions by Famous Studios, including Snow Foolin'. Certain prints also contain Jack Frost, a 1934 cartoon produced by Ub Iwerks and released through Celebrity Productions. The film's title song would be slightly rewritten the following year for the New Years-themed Popeye the Sailor cartoon \\"Let's Celebrake\\" where it was sung by Popeye and Bluto at the beginning.

Saint Patrick refers to Focluth in the autobiographical portion of his Confession: > ...I heard the voices of those Irish who live near the woods of Focluth near > the Western Sea. They called out to me with a single voice: \\"We beg you, > holy boy, come here and walk among us!\\" Because Patrick was a native of Roman Britain who was taken to Ireland as a slave, most modern scholarship assumes that Focluth was the site of his captivity.  Focluth's location  Focluth's location is not known with certainty. Patrick's 7th-century biographer, T√≠rech√°n, writing two centuries after Patrick, indicates that Foclut was in County Mayo near the border with County Sligo, near the modern village of Killala. There is no direct evidence for this location, but the circumstantial case is fairly strong. Patrick indicates that during his escape from captivity, he had to travel 200 Roman miles (about 185 statute miles) to find a ship to take him to Britain, i.e., a ship on the east coast of Ireland. Additionally, the Killala area's modern climate, among the coldest and wettest in Ireland, meshes well with Patrick's description of performing slave labor \\"through snow and frost and rain.\\" References Further reading  The Confession of St. Patrick at Calvin College Category:Forests and woodlands of Ireland ","title":"Foclut"},{"id":"10411987","title":"A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar"},{"id":"10412011","text":"The California Supplemental Examination is a professional licensure exam established and regulated by the California Architects Board. In order to become a licensed architect in the State of California, a candidate must pass this exam in addition to passing the required national architect registration exams, and completing all other requirements. The exam was previously delivered in an oral format, but around 2010 it was converted to be a computer-delivered, multiple-choice examination. The exam is administered through a vendor, by permission of the California Architects Board. Upon completion of the Intern Development Program and successful completion of the Architect Registration Examination, a candidate is then permitted to sit for the California Supplemental Exam. The test plan is organized into four separate topics covering a variety of specific aspects of architectural Practice. Exam procedure  The exam was previously a structured oral examination that lasted approximately 1.5 hours. It was administered by a panel of three architects with current California registration. A question was asked to the candidate, with no further clarification of the question allowed. The candidate was to give an answer that is scored by each member of the panel independently. The number of questions was approximately thirty. Candidates were given the opportunity to demonstrate through oral responses their overall understanding of architectural practice, and required to demonstrate at least entry-level competence in the areas outlined in the CSE test plan. A competent entry-level architect is able to discharge the responsibilities incumbent upon him or her in providing professional architectural services to the public. Additionally, a competent entry-level architect must understand the integration of architectural practice and the architect's responsibilities as they relate to architectural practice in California. The exam is based on a hypothetical project and includes graphic and written documents that candidates have the opportunity to review prior to - and have access to during - the CSE. The project description and graphics provide a focus for the examination questions and establish a context for candidate responses. The oral format was phased out in 2010, and the exam is now in a timed computer- delivered multiple choice format. Test plan The test plan has not changed since the format of the test moved from oral to multiple choice on a computer, and is based on the results of a statewide survey of practicing California architects. The intent of the test plan is not to duplicate coverage of general areas of practice already addressed by the national test, the Architectural Registration Examination, but to focus on California-specific aspects of practice; it is therefore neither comprehensive nor representative of the full scope of architectural practice. The exam administered in 2009-2010 was based on a test plan that is divided into four categories of architectural knowledge and abilities important to the tasks that California architects perform, as follows: :1. General Practice :2. Programming/Design :3. Development/Documentation :4. Bidding/Construction The board has a list of reference materials for the 2009-2010 administrations which can assist candidates in preparing for the exam. The list details the resources with which to be familiar and how they may be obtained. Some of the materials are available for a nominal cost, and others for free.

The Russian armies had defeated their opponents and threw them back to the Carpathian mountains. The battle was part of the series of engagements known as Battle of Galicia. The Fourth Army commanded by Moritz von Auffenberg, victorious in the Battle of Komarow, was given order to turn south to aid the Third Army (Rudolf Brudermann) which had suffered heavy casualties. This had created a gap between the First (Viktor Dankl) and Fourth Armies, and the gap was exploited by the Russian Third Army commanded by Pavel Plehve. Near Rava-Ruska (Galicia, today Ukraine) nine Austro-Hungarian divisions clashed with nine Russian divisions. The units commanded by Auffenberg were barely able to escape encirclement for the price of lengthy retreat and large loss of men and equipment. Blame for the defeat was put on Auffenberg though the movement to help the Third Army was an order by Conrad von H√∂tzendorf. Later during the war, Rava-Ruska was re-captured by the Central Powers armies on June 21, 1915. Sources * Nicholas Golovin. \\"The Great Battle of Galicia, 1914: a Study in Strategy\\".

Description The shrub has a dense spreading habit and typically grows to a height of less than . It has ribbed, red to brown coloured branchlets that are asperulate. The pungent, rigid, glabrous, green phyllodes are subsessile and patent to inclined. The phyllodes are straight to shallowly recurved and have a length of and a width of and have 10 to 12 distant raised nerves. It blooms between May and October and produces simple inflorescences simple in groups of one to four situated in the axils. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of and contain over 20 bright yellow flowers. The brown undulate seed pods that form after flowering have yellow margins. The coriaceous seed pods have a length of around and a width of . The dull dark brown to black coloured seeds in the pods have an oblong to elliptic shape and are around in length. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist R.V.Smith in 1957 as part of the work A remarkable new Acacia for Victoria (The \\"Jumping-Jack\\" Wattle) as published in The Victorian Naturalist. It was reclassified as Racosperma enterocarpum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2005. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek words entero meaninf intestines and karpos meaning fruit in reference to the shape of the seed pod. Both Acacia colletioides and Acacia nyssophylla are closely related to A. enterocarpa. Distribution It has a disjunct distribution through parts of south eastern South Australia and western Victoria. It is found on the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula and Yorke Peninsula from around Curramulka and near Bordertown extending eastwards as far as to Nhill in western Victoria. It is often found as part of woodland to open forest communities and grows in sandy alkaline soils as well as neutral yellow duplex to red porous loamy soils and grey cracking clay soils.

Her 1984 doctoral thesis at Cambridge University was entitled \\"Non capitalist land rent: theories and the case of North India\\" under the supervision of Dr. T Byres. Career Ghosh has previously held positions at Tufts University and Cambridge University, lecturing meanwhile at academic institutions throughout India. She is one of the founders of the Economic Research Foundation, New Delhi, a non-profit trust devoted to progressive economic research. (Selections of her columns from the Macroscan, the Foundation's outlet, will be published as Tracking the Macroeconomy.) She is also the Executive Secretary of the International Development Economics Associates (IDEAS), a network of economists critical of the mainstream economic paradigm of neo- liberalism. Ghosh was the principal author of the West Bengal Human Development Report which has received the United Nations Development Programme Prize for excellence in analysis. In addition to her many scholarly articles, she writes regular columns on economics and current affairs for Frontline magazine, Business Line, the Bengali newspaper Ganashakti, Deccan Chronicle, and Asian Age. She also writes a regular column for the fortnightly national magazine Frontline, focusing mainly on economic issues. Ghosh was conferred International Labour Organisation's Decent Work Research Prize along with Professor Eve Landau in February 2011. In Spring Term 2011, she served as the first Ragnar Nurkse Visiting Professor in Development Economics at Tallinn University of Technology's Technology Governance graduate program. Criticisms of the government Ghosh has consistently maintained a pro- student stance. In February 2016, she alleged the NDA government of shutting down student protests against the capital punishment sentence to Afzal Guru. In a lecture enumerating the \\"anti-national policies of the NDA\\", she spoke about the importance of student protests and discussion, and the current government's aversion to the demand for transparency and accountability. In October 2019, Ghosh expressed her belief that the relay of policymakers who were fixed to political dogmas that discouraged more public spending was dangerous to the economy and destabilizing to society. In her co-authored book, Demonetisation Decoded: A critique of India‚Äôs monetary experiment, she criticizes the monetary decision taken by the Modi government as an ineffective and wasteful exercise. In February of 2020, Ghosh criticized the Modi-led government for misrepresenting data in the 2020 Budget which was presented a month earlier than usual. Claiming that the government did not have data post December 2019, she declared Nirmala Sitharaman's pre-budget speech as ineffectual and inaccurate. She also emphasized the lack of attention given to the need for creation of employment in the new budget, stating that there were cuts in almost every employment-intensive sector. By withholding information that by constitutional law should be freely available to the public, she said, the Modi government was able to play caste politics.  Role in 2020 Delhi riots  On 12 September 2020, she along with Sitaram Yechuri, Yogendra Yadav and others was named in the supplementary chargesheet by Delhi Police for her role in 2020 Delhi riots.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/delhi-police-riot-chargesheet- sitaram-yechury-yogendra-yadav-6593798/  Awards and recognitions  * Conference President, Indian Society for Labour Economics, 2013. * Satyendranath Sen Award, Asiatic Society, Kolkata, 2012. * ILO Decent Work Research Prize, Geneva, 2010. * NordSud Prize for Research in Social Sciences, Fondazione Pescarabruzzo, Italy, 2010. * Ava Maiti Memorial Prize, Asiatic Society, Kolkata 2006. * UNDP Award for Excellence in Analysis, (for West Bengal Human Development Report), New York 2006.

It belongs to the LY6/uPAR/alpha-neurotoxin protein family. CD59 attaches to host cells via a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. When complement activation leads to deposition of C5b678 on host cells, CD59 can prevent C9 from polymerizing and forming the complement membrane attack complex. It may also signal the cell to perform active measures such as endocytosis of the CD59-CD9 complex. Mutations affecting GPI that reduce expression of CD59 and decay-accelerating factor on red blood cells result in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Viruses such as HIV, human cytomegalovirus and vaccinia incorporate host cell CD59 into their own viral envelope to prevent lysis by complement.

Policy analysis includes substantive area research (such as health or education policy), program evaluation and impact studies, and policy design. It \\"involves systematically studying the nature, causes, and effects of alternative public policies, with particular emphasis on determining the policies that will achieve given goals.\\" It emerged in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. Policy studies also examines the conflicts and conflict resolution that arise from the making of policies in civil society, the private sector, or more commonly, in the public sector (e.g. government). While policy studies frequently focus on the public sector it is applicable to other organizations (e.g., the not-for-profit sector). Some policy study experts graduate from public policy schools with public policy degrees. Alternatively, experts may have backgrounds in policy analysis, program evaluation, sociology, psychology, philosophy, economics, anthropology, geography, law, political science, social work, environmental planning and public administration. Traditionally, the field of policy studies focused on foreign and defense policies. However, the wave of economic globalization, which ensued in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, created a need for a subset of policy studies that focuses on global governance, especially as it relates to issues that transcend national borders such as climate change, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and economic development. This subset of policy studies, which is often referred to as international policy studies, typically requires mastery of a second language and attention to cross-cultural issues in order to address national and cultural biases. For example, the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College offers master of arts programs that focus exclusively on international policy through a mix of interdisciplinary and cross-cultural analysis called the \\"Monterey Way\\". Examples of academic programs in policy studies include the Balsillie School of International Affairs, Blavatnik School of Government, Sciences Po Paris, Harvard Kennedy School and the LBJ School of Public Affairs.

Career The group formed in Plainfield, New Jersey, United States, in 1964 when singer-guitarist Don Ciccone (February 28, 1946 ‚Äì October 8, 2016) went to see the band in which a friend of his, saxophonist Bob Podstawski, was a member. This local group was the Vibratones, comprising Jim Ryan (lead guitar), Ken Gorka (bass), Jack Decker (drums), and Chris Darway (keyboards) along with Podstawski. Ciccone was impressed by the group and asked Podstawski if he could arrange an audition with them. The group was taken by Ciccone's playing ability and the fact that he also wrote songs. Ciccone was asked to join with the group renaming themselves \\"The Critters\\", in emulation of similar band names like the Animals. The Critters were originally signed to Musicor Records by Jimmy Radcliffe, who also produced their first release \\"Georgianna\\" backed with \\"I'm Gonna Give\\" in 1964. They eventually signed with Kapp Records, and in 1965 recorded John Sebastian's song \\"Younger Girl\\" for their first release. The song was selected for the band by producer Artie Ripp. However, because Ciccone, Ryan, and Podstawski were then all accepted at Villanova University, the record was not completed until late 1965. \\"Younger Girl\\" became a minor pop hit in early 1966, and reached #38 in the UK Singles Chart in July that year. It was followed by Ciccone's song \\"Mr. Dieingly Sad\\", also produced by Ripp, which reached #17 later in the year, and by \\"Bad Misunderstanding\\", which reached #55 still later in 1966. The group had their final chart hit with \\"Don't Let the Rain Fall Down on Me\\" in 1967, at #39. By the time \\"Younger Girl\\" and \\"Mr. Dieingly Sad\\" had their respective chart success, Ciccone had already left the group due primarily to the Viet Nam War and his draft status at the time. He had decided to join the U.S. Air Force, in which he would remain for four years, so he would have some choice as to where he would end up. After recording several singles and one album (Younger Girl), the original band split up when Podstawski and Decker also joined the armed services and Darway left for art college. Ryan and Gorka then attempted to maintain the group with new members for some time, releasing two more albums (Touch 'n Go With The Critters and Critters). Later, Ryan recorded and toured with Carly Simon before working as a studio guitarist. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons, and he was a member of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons (1973‚Äì81). He played guitar, bass and sang lead vocals to the Four Seasons song \\"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\\", and later toured with Tommy James and the Shondells as bassist. Gorka became a booking agent and co-owner of The Bitter End in Greenwich Village; he died on March 20, 2015, at age 68. Ciccone died from a heart attack on October 8, 2016, at age 70. Darway went on to form Johnny's Dance Band, a popular group in the Philadelphia area in the late 1970s, followed by the Chet Bolins Band. Kurt Shanaman of Mountainside, New Jersey filled in on drums on tour and in the studio in 1967. In 2007, the Critters re-formed when Ciccone was asked to join the band Skeezix, which included Albert Miller, Lenny Rocco, and Milt Koster. Their repertoire included classic hits from all the bands Ciccone was involved with (including a slightly retitled \\"Mr. Dyingly Sad\\"), as well as original and cover material. The band performed mostly on the Treasure Coast of Florida. The Critters recorded a new album, Time Pieces, which includes the updated \\"Mr. Dyingly Sad\\" and a new version of \\"Younger Girl\\". The band announced their breakup in the summer of 2013.

In mathematical programming and polyhedral combinatorics, the Hirsch conjecture is the statement that the edge-vertex graph of an n-facet polytope in d-dimensional Euclidean space has diameter no more than n ‚àí d. That is, any two vertices of the polytope must be connected to each other by a path of length at most n ‚àí d. The conjecture was first put forth in a letter by to George B. Dantzig in 1957, pp. 160 and 168. and was motivated by the analysis of the simplex method in linear programming, as the diameter of a polytope provides a lower bound on the number of steps needed by the simplex method. The conjecture is now known to be false in general. The Hirsch conjecture was proven for d < 4 and for various special cases,E.g. see for 0-1 polytopes. while the best known upper bounds on the diameter are only sub-exponential in n and d.. After more than fifty years, a counter-example was announced in May 2010 by Francisco Santos Leal, from the University of Cantabria... The result was presented at the conference 100 Years in Seattle: the mathematics of Klee and Gr√ºnbaum and appeared in Annals of Mathematics. Specifically, the paper presented a 43-dimensional polytope of 86 facets with a diameter of more than 43. The counterexample has no direct consequences for the analysis of the simplex method, as it does not rule out the possibility of a larger but still linear or polynomial number of steps. Various equivalent formulations of the problem had been given, such as the d-step conjecture, which states that the diameter of any 2d-facet polytope in d-dimensional Euclidean space is no more than d; Santos Leal's counterexample also disproves this conjecture., p. 84..  Statement of the conjecture  The graph of a convex polytope P is any graph whose vertices are in bijection with the vertices of P in such a way that any two vertices of the graph are joined by an edge if and only if the two corresponding vertices of P are joined by an edge of the polytope. The diameter of P, denoted \\\\delta(P), is the diameter of any one of its graphs. These definitions are well-defined since any two graphs of the same polytope must be isomorphic as graphs. We may then state the Hirsch conjecture as follows: Conjecture Let P be a d-dimensional convex polytope with n facets. Then \\\\delta(P)\\\\leq n-d. For example, a cube in three dimensions has six facets. The Hirsch conjecture then indicates that the diameter of this cube cannot be greater than three. Accepting the conjecture would imply that any two vertices of the cube may be connected by a path from vertex to vertex using, at most, three steps. For all polytopes of dimension at least 8, this bound is actually optimal; no polytope of dimension d\\\\geq 8 has a diameter less than n-d, with n being the number of its facets, as before. In other words, for nearly all cases, the conjecture provides the minimum number of steps needed to join any two vertices of a polytope by a path along its edges. Since the simplex method essentially operates by constructing a path from some vertex of the feasible region to an optimal point, the Hirsch conjecture would provide a lower bound needed for the simplex method to terminate in the worst case scenario. The Hirsch conjecture is a special case of the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which claims that there exists some positive integer k such that, for all polytopes P, \\\\delta(P)=O(n^k), where n is the number of facets of P.  Progress and intermediate results  The Hirsch conjecture has been proven true for a number of cases. For example, any polytope with dimension 3 or lower satisfies the conjecture. Any d-dimensional polytope with n facets such that n-d\\\\leq 6 satisfies the conjecture as well. Other attempts to solve the conjecture manifested out of a desire to formulate a different problem whose solution would imply the Hirsch conjecture. One example of particular importance is the d-step conjecture, a relaxation of the Hirsch conjecture that has actually been shown to be equivalent to it. Theorem The following statements are equivalent: # \\\\delta(P)\\\\leq n-d for all d-dimensional polytopes P with n facets. # \\\\delta(P)\\\\leq d for all d-dimensional polytopes P with 2d facets. In other words, in order to prove or disprove the Hirsch conjecture, one only needs to consider polytopes with exactly twice as many facets as its dimension. Another significant relaxation is that the Hirsch conjecture holds for all polytopes if and only if it holds for all simple polytopes.  Counterexample  The octahedron is one of the most well-known examples of a spindle. Unfortunately, the Hirsch conjecture is not true in all cases, as shown by Francisco Santos in 2011. Santos' explicit construction of a counterexample comes both from the fact that the conjecture may be relaxed to only consider simple polytopes, and from equivalence between the Hirsch and d-step conjectures. In particular, Santos produces his counterexample by examining a particular class of polytopes called spindles. Definition A d-spindle is a d-dimensional polytope P for which there exist a pair of distinct vertices such that every facet of P contains exactly one of these two vertices. The length of the shortest path between these two vertices is called the length of the spindle. The disproof of the Hirsch conjecture relies on the following theorem, referred to as the strong d-step theorem for spindles. Theorem (Santos) Let P be a d-spindle. Let n be the number of its facets, and let l be its length. Then there exists an (n-d)-spindle, P', with 2n-2d facets and a length bounded below by l+n-2d. In particular, if l>d, then P' violates the d-step conjecture. Santos then proceeds to construct a 5-dimensionsal spindle with length 6, hence proving that there exists another spindle that serves as a counterexample to the Hirsch conjecture. The first of these two spindles has 48 facets and 322 vertices, while the spindle that actually disproves the conjecture has 86 facets and is 43-dimensional. This counterexample does not disprove the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which remains an open problem. NotesReferences *.

Reductions () in Sweden and its dominions were the return to the Crown of fiefs that had been granted to the Swedish nobility. Several reductions are recorded, from the 13th century until this final one of 1680.  Background  The reductions were fought for by gentry, tradesmen, state servants, and peasantry alike, partly as a way to curb the power of the great aristocratic families and partly as a way to make the state solvent and able to pay its debts. One such reduction, () under Charles X Gustav of Sweden in 1655, intended at restoring a quarter of \\"donations\\" made after 1632. However, the outbreak of the Second Northern War prevented its realisation. Only after Charles XI's entry into maturity in 1672, it began to be implemented effectively. It would soon become obvious, that it was not enough to bring public finances into balance. Results It is not known exactly how much the Swedish Crown profited from the reductions. The reductions carried out during the reign of Charles XI seem to have resulted in 1,950,000 daler silvermynt in annual rent of which 700,000 were from Sweden and Finland, the core of the Swedish Empire. The dominions in the eastern Baltic and northern Germany yielded approximately 1,150,000 daler silvermynt, of which 550,000 came from Livonia alone. Swedish Crown Financially, the reduction during the reign of Charles XI resulted in a significant increase of the assets of the Swedish Crown. To a high degree, it contributed to the development of the strong and meticulous organization of the realm's finances and government. The reduction also improved the situation of the landowning peasant's estate, especially since many of the recovered fiefs were sold to peasants during the reign of Charles XII. Sometimes the reduction is claimed to have saved the independence of the peasant estate, but this claim is not substantiated. Nobility The reduction had an enormous effect on the economy and status of the nobility in Sweden. Since the fiefs that were reduced might have changed owners over the course of many generations, the reduction resulted not only in the loss of the fiefdoms but the cancellation of inheritances from times past, purchases, exchanges, etc. This caused a general insecurity with regards to ownership and creditworthiness among the noble families. Politically the reduction meant a complete change in the status of the aristocracy. The old land-owning nobility, which through its land ownership had asserted a certain independence even against royal power, lost its power base and was replaced by a rather dependent nobility serving the state in a bureaucratic capacity. The differences between the estates persisted, however, as did the privileges; among these, land still owned by the nobility was taxed at lower rates than land owned by the peasantry.  The foreign dominions The reductions had major consequences in the Swedish foreign dominions. They affected both Swedes who had received fiefdoms and represented in the Swedish riksdag and native landowners in the dominions. The Swedish Crown demanded fiefdoms in the Baltic provinces that had been given before Swedish suzerainty. Some local nobles claimed that the Swedish Crown thereby ignored the local laws in the dominions. Especially in Livonia, an old feudal state in which all land since the establishment of the Teutonic Order had been in the hands of the nobility, the demands had profound consequences. Serfs on the reduced fiefdoms were now transferred to the Swedish Crown, which caused dissatisfaction among members of the German-Baltic nobility and led, in particular, to Livonian nobleman, Johann Patkul (1660‚Äì1707) conspiring with Peter the Great (1672-1725) of Russia and Augustus the Strong of Saxony (1670‚Äì1733), to start the Great Northern War against Sweden.

He also was a member of the Chicago Blitz and Arizona Wranglers of the United States Football League. He played college football at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. Early years Dennison attended Lancaster High School, where he was a district triple jump champion and finished sixth in the state finals. He played only 2 years of football. He accepted a track scholarship from Kutztown State College, where he set school records in the triple jump with 47 feet and the long jump with 23 feet. As a junior in 1972, he began playing football as a two-way starter at safety and running back. As a senior in 1973, he was leading the division in rushing, when he suffered a left knee injury in the fifth game of the season and was lost for the year. He received second team All-PSAC honors, after finishing the year with 587 rushing yards on 149 carries and 13 receptions for 128 yards. In 1978, he was inducted into the Kutztown Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Dennison was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1974 NFL Draft, after not being selected because of his college knee injury. The NFL players held a strike from July until August, which helped him get an extended look in training camp and eventually become the first NFL player from Kutztown State. As a rookie, he was a contributor in special teams and established himself as the team's short-yardage specialist, registering 4 touchdowns. In 1975, when Calvin Hill left to join the WFL, he was used in combination with Preston Pearson and Charley Young. He started his first three games, finishing the season with 383 rushing yards (third on the team) and 7 rushing touchdowns (led the team). Head coach Tom Landry once said: \\"Doug Dennison is the best guy I know to give a football to on the goal line or short yardage,\\" \\"if you want to make it, you give it to Doug. Dennison is going to give you everything he's got.\\" and \\"Doug Dennison is a warrior,\\", \\"If you had to go to war, you'd want to go with Doug Dennison\\". In 1976, he was named the starter after Pearson missed most of the season with an injury, leading the team in rushing (542 yards) and also scoring 6 touchdowns. He started 10 out of 14 games, alternating later at running back when Pearson returned. In 1977, he was relegated to playing mostly on special teams with the arrival of Tony Dorsett. In 1978, he was placed on the injured reserve list, after suffering a left knee injury while playing special teams in the sixth game against the New York Giants. On August 21, 1979, he was waived to make room for Ron Springs. He finished his Cowboys career with 19 touchdowns on 309 carries and 1,112 rushing yards. Cleveland Browns The Cleveland Browns signed him on October 13, 1979, to replace Greg Pruitt, who was lost for the season with an injured knee. At the end of his one-year contract, the Browns didn't re-sign him after drafting Charles White. Toronto Argonauts (CFL) On March 21, 1980, he signed with the Toronto Argonauts. After injuring his left knee on the first day of camp, he announced his retirement. He later changed his mind and rejoined the team in August, but was waived on September 11, 1980. Chicago Blitz (USFL) After being out of football for three years, head coach George Allen signed him to the Chicago Blitz in 1983, to provide depth behind Tim Spencer. He finished the season with 134 rushing yards on 42 carries and 15 receptions for 166 yards and one touchdown. Arizona Wranglers (USFL) In 1984, the Chicago Blitz and the Arizona Wranglers engineered a swap of assets in which Allen, the Blitz coaching staff and most of the Blitz players moved to Phoenix, while most of the Wranglers roster moved to Chicago, with the exception of Alan Risher, who stayed in Arizona to back up Greg Landry. The agreement allowed the team to move, while keeping a strong roster. Dennison remained a backup before retiring at the end of the season.

Nhu was the brother of South Vietnam's president, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. A former servant of the Ng√¥ family, Tung's military background was in security and counterespionage. During the 1950s, Tung was a high-ranking official in Nhu's C·∫ßn Lao, a secret political apparatus which maintained the Ng√¥ family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen. In 1960, Tung was promoted directly to the rank of colonel and became the commander of the special forces. His period at the helm of South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in repressing dissidents, rather than fighting the Viet Cong insurgents. His best-known attack was the raid on X√° L·ª£i pagoda on 21 August 1963, in which hundreds died or disappeared. Tung's main military programme was a scheme in which Army of the Republic of Vietnam personnel attempted to infiltrate North Vietnam in order to engage in intelligence gathering and sabotage. The program was ineffective; the vast majority of infiltrators were killed or captured. Tung was also reported to be planning an assassination attempt on Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the United States Ambassador to South Vietnam. Following the pagoda raids, the United States terminated funding to Tung's men because they were used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Di·ªám and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup in order to give a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot. ƒê√≠nh tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow of the regime. Early career alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. Tung was born on June 13, 1919 in central Vietnam, which was then the protectorate of Annam in French Indochina. The former servant of the Ng√¥ family was devoutly Roman Catholic,Karnow, p. 123. short and bespectacled. Tung had a military background almost entirely in security and counterespionage, which was an unusual basis for leading the special forces. Tung had first served the French as a security officer in Central Vietnam. He then worked for Di·ªám as a lieutenant in the military security service in Central Vietnam. As a high-ranking official in Nhu's C·∫ßn Lao, the secret Catholic political apparatus which maintained the Ng√¥ family's grip on power, Tung raised party funds by extorting money from wealthy businessmen. Tung was primarily known among colleagues for his unwavering loyalty to Di·ªám.Jones, p. 301. In 1960, he was promoted straight to the rank of colonel and placed in charge of the special forces.Shaplen, p. 190. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarded Tung as the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Di·ªám and Nhu, thereby ranking him as South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.Prochnau, p. 368. Head of special forces Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu (right), shaking hands with then US Vice President alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. Tung had been trained by the CIA in the United States.Karnow, p. 307. A Di·ªám loyalist, he led a force of 1,840 men,Langguth, p. 248. which operated under the direction of Nhu rather than the army command.Jones, p. 390. He did not conduct operations against the communist Vi·ªát C·ªông insurgents, but used his forces mainly in Saigon to repress opponents of the Di·ªám regime.Karnow, p. 309. Tung's most notable attacks occurred during the Buddhist crisis of 1963. During this period, the Buddhist majority engaged in mass protests against the pro-Catholic policies of the Di·ªám regime.Jacobs, pp. 143‚Äì50. On 21 August 1963, Tung's men, acting on Nhu's orders, raided the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda, Saigon's main Buddhist temple. The attacks were replicated across the nation, leaving a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds.Jacobs, pp. 152‚Äì53. The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400 monks and nuns were arrested. The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare martial law. He knew the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers.Hammer, pp. 166‚Äì67. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country.Jones, pp. 299‚Äì309. Following the attacks, U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the special forces unless they were used to fight communists rather than attacking political or religious dissidents.Tucker, p. 227. Another notable religious attack was perpetrated by Tung's men in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of ƒê√† N·∫µng. Local Buddhists began to believe that the fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As more people made pilgrimages to the pond, so disquiet grew among the district chief and his subordinates, who answered to Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, another younger brother of Di·ªám. The officials mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the carp again escaped death. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in Tung's special forces. Tung's men grenaded the pond, finally killing the carp. The killing backfired, because it generated more publicity ‚Äì many newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. ARVN helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.Prochnau, p. 411. Tung also headed a group run by the CIA, in which ARVN personnel of northern origin infiltrated North Vietnam, posing as locals. The objective was to gather intelligence and sabotage communist infrastructure and communications facilities. The recruits were trained in bases at Nha Trang, ƒê√† N·∫µng, and sometimes offshore in Taiwan, Guam and Okinawa. Around eighty groups of operatives, each numbering six or seven men, were deployed in 1963. They entered the north via parachute drops or sampan journeys at night, but nearly all were captured or killed. The captives were frequently used in communist propaganda broadcasts. Tung was criticised for his management of the operations.Karnow, p. 378. At Nhu's request, Tung was reported to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.Jones, p. 393. U.S. sanctions Following the pagoda raids, the U.S. began exploring the possibility of replacing Di·ªám. Cable 243 informed the US embassy to look for alternative leadership if Di·ªám did not remove Nhu.Jacobs, pp. 163‚Äì64. In September, the Krulak‚ÄìMendenhall mission was despatched to South Vietnam to analyse the domestic situation and the war against the communists.Jones, pp. 356‚Äì57. One of the resulting suggestions was to terminate funding of the special forces as an expression of disapproval of Tung and Nhu's actions. Another was to run covert campaigns to discredit Tung.Jones, p. 359. The Krulak‚ÄìMendenhall mission ended in a stalemate, so the Kennedy administration followed up with the McNamara‚ÄìTaylor mission. The second expedition resulted in the suspension of funding for the special forces until they were placed under the command of the army's Joint General Staff (JGS) and sent into battle.Hammer, pp. 246‚Äì47. The McNamara‚ÄìTaylor mission's report noted that one of the reasons for sending Tung's men into the field was because they \\"are a continuing support for Di·ªám\\".Hammer, pp. 235‚Äì36. The Americans were aware that removing the special forces from Saigon would increase the chances that a coup would succeed, thereby encouraging the army to overthrow the president. Di·ªám and Nhu were undeterred by the suspension of aid, keeping Tung and his men in the capital.Hammer, pp. 272‚Äì73. In private talks with US officials, Di·ªám insisted that the army was responsible for the pagoda attacks and that Tung's men were already under the control of the JGS.Hammer, p. 282. Coup and assassination By September, Di·ªám and Nhu knew that a group of generals were planning a coup.Karnow, p. 318. Nhu ordered Tung and T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh ‚Äì a loyalist general who commanded the ARVN III Corps which encompassed the Saigon regionKarnow, p. 317. ‚Äì to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick anti-government dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated.Jones, pp. 398‚Äì99. Another aim was to provide a public relations stunt that would give a false impression of the strength of the regime. Codenamed Operation Bravo, the first stage of the scheme involved some of Tung's loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup. Tung would then announce the formation of a \\"revolutionary government\\" consisting of opposition activists, while Di·ªám and Nhu pretended to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the disguised loyalists would riot and in the ensuing mayhem, kill the leading coup plotters, such as Generals D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, L√™ VƒÉn Kim and junior officers that were helping them. Tung's men and some of Nhu's underworld connections were also to kill some figures who were assisting the conspirators, such as the titular but relatively powerless Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, CIA officer Lucien Conein, who was on assignment in Vietnam as a military adviser, and Ambassador Lodge. These would then be blamed on \\"neutralist and pro-communist elements\\".Sheehan, p. 368. This was to be followed by a fake \\"counter-coup\\", whereupon Tung's special forces, having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting communists, as well as ƒê√≠nh's forces would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to reaffirm the Di·ªám regime. Nhu would then exploit the scare to round up dissidents.Karnow, p. 319. However, Nhu and Tung were unaware that ƒê√≠nh was part of the real coup plot. The III Corps commander told Tung that the counter-coup needed to employ an overwhelming amount of force. He said that tanks were required \\"because armour is dangerous\\". In an attempt to outwit Tung, ƒê√≠nh said that fresh troops were needed,Jones, p. 399. opining: The loyalists were unaware that ƒê√≠nh's real intention was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside where they could not defend the president. Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital of Saigon on 29 October 1963. executed on the way to military headquarters.thumbright150pxalt=Middle-aged black-haired man lies face half-down on the floor, covered on his face and dark suit and trousers with blood. His hands are behind his back. On 1 November 1963, Tung was summoned by the coup organisers to the Joint General Staff headquarters near T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base, on the pretext of a routine officers' lunch meeting.Jones, p. 408. At 13:30, General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, but Tung did not. He was taken away by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung, the bodyguard of General Minh. As he was led away, Tung shouted \\"Remember who gave you your stars!\\" During the early stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace.Jones, p. 410.Hammer, p. 287. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Di·ªám on the phone, telling the president that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Di·ªám loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids.Hammer, p. 290. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning,Karnow, p. 310.Jones, p. 325. having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.Jones, p. 388. At nightfall he was taken with Major L√™ Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã·ªáu, his brother and deputy,Karnow, p. 321. hands tied, into a jeep and driven to edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.Jones, p. 414. The coup was successful, and on the following morning, Di·ªám and Nhu were captured and executed.Karnow, pp. 324‚Äì26.

Early years Anuruddha was the son of Amitodana and brother to Mahanama. Since Amitodana was the brother of Suddhodana, king of the Sakyas in Kapilavastu, Anuruddha was cousin to Siddhartha, (Gautama Buddha). He was a kshatriya by birth, enabling him to be raised in wealth. Gautama Buddha returned to his home town two years after his enlightenment, preaching his ideas to the Sakyan kingdom. Together with his 3 cousins Bhaddiya, Ananda, and Devadatta and their servant Upali, became ordained by the Buddha at the Anupiya Mango Grove. Religious life Anuruddha acquired \\"divine vision\\" (dibba-cakkhu) and was ranked foremost among those who had the ability. Sariputta assigned the eight thoughts of a great man for Anuruddha to use as a meditation topic. Journeying into the Pacinavamsadaya in the Ceti country to practice, he was able to master seven, but could not learn the eighth, which Buddha taught him. Anuruddha developed insight and then realized arahantship. Depiction Anuruddha is depicted in the Pali Canon as an affectionate and loyal bhikkhu, and stood near the Buddha in assembly. At one point, when the Buddha was disappointed with the arguments of the monks at Kosambi, he retreated to Pacinavamsadaya to stay with Anuruddha. In many texts, even when many distinguished monks were present, Anuruddha is often the recipient of the Buddha's questions, and answers on behalf of the sangha. After the Buddha Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusinara. He was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing their future course of action, reminding them of the Buddha's decree to follow the dharma. As the Buddha was reclining and going through the jhanas, Ananda said to Anuruddha: \\"The Exalted One has attained final Nibbana, Venerable Sir.\\" Anuruddha, having divine vision, stated that the Buddha was absorbed in the state of \\"cessation,\\" but had not yet died. Anuruddha was consulted by the Mallas of Kusinara regarding the Buddha's last obsequies. Later, at the First Buddhist Council, he played a notable role and was entrusted with the custody of the Anguttara Nikaya. Anuruddha died at Veluvagama in the Vajji country, in the shade of a bamboo thicket. He was one hundred and fifteen years old at the time of his death. Depictions in the Jataka Anuruddha is frequently depicted in the Jataka, which describes the previous reincarnations of Buddhist figures. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he had been a wealthy householder. Hearing one of the monks declared best among possessors of the celestial eye, he desired a similar honor. He performed acts of merit, including holding a great feast of light in front of the Buddha's tomb. In Kassapa Buddha's era he had reincarnated and was born in Varanasi; one day he placed bowls filled with ghee around the Buddha's tomb and set them alight, circumscribed the tomb throughout the night, bearing on his head a lighted bowl. He was reborn in an impoverished family in Varanasi and was named Annabhara. One day, while working for his master, the banker Sumana, he gave his meal to a Pratyekabuddha, Uparittha. The banker, having heard of Annabhara's pious deed, rewarded him by helping to establish a business for him. The king, impressed, gave him a site for a house, and when the ground beneath was excavated, yielded much buried treasure.

The church that meets there is now called Central. Its full name since 1934 is St Philip and St Jacob with Emmanuel the Unity, although reference to the original church of St Philip exists in records dating from 1174. Historically the 'Mother church of East Bristol', it serves the area known as The Dings. The building St Philip and St Jacob refers to itself as the city's 'oldest place of Christian worship'. The church began as a small priory around AD 900. It was later rebuilt by Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, who also built the nearby priory of St James'. All that remains of the original church is the font, although parts of the chancel and tower date from at least the 13th Century. The building was extended during the Middle Ages to include the present-day nave, the pillars of which are actually Victorian additions, possibly by William Armstrong. The tower contains eight bells dating from 1738 and made by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. Around 1860 new plans were submitted by John Bindon, Richard Shackleton Pope and Thomas Shackleton Pope and accepted for the rebuilding of the church. An extension was also added to the south-east corner of the church during the 1980s, comprising meeting rooms, a kitchen and other facilities. The building is an English Heritage Grade II* listed structure. Archives Parish records for St Philip & St Jacob church, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P. St P&J;) (online catalogue) including baptism, marriage and burial registers. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, overseer of the poor, parochial church council, charities, schools and vestry plus photographs, deeds, pictures, maps and plans. Closure threats During the English civil war the demolition of the church was ordered (along with nearby St Peter's) to prevent its use as a fortress for attacking the city of Bristol. However, reinforcements arriving in the city meant that the building was saved. In the early 1960s, the church was again threatened with closure, but managed to avoid becoming a potato factory due to the vision and determination of its then-small congregation, who adopted both the motto 'Seek First' (from Matthew Chapter 6, verse 33) and, uniquely, the nickname 'Pip 'n' Jay'. The church today Since 1963, St Philip and St Jacob has become one of the leading Evangelical churches in Bristol. In the 1970s it was part of the Charismatic revival in the Church of England. Its vicar was the Revd Canon Malcolm Widdecombe (1937-2010, brother of Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe) from 1974 until his retirement in 2009. He died of metastatic oesophageal cancer on 12 October 2010.Tributes to Malcolm Widdecombe His son, the Revd Roger Widdecombe, is an Anglican priest.Thanksgiving Service at annwiddecombe.com Today, the church supports and sends out many missionaries. The parish has passed Resolution B of the Priests (Ordination of Women) Measure 1993; this means it would not accept a woman as its incumbent. The parish St Philip and St Jacob is one of the original parishes of Bristol. It includes the Old Market area, and extended beyond the original city boundaries to include what are now the Bristol districts of Baptist Mills, Barton Hill, Lawrence Hill, Newtown, Russell Town, St Jude's, St Philips Marsh, The Dings and part of Easton. A growing population in the 19th century led to the building of ten new churches in the east of the parish, seven of which have now closed.

He had attracted the attention of the heir to the throne, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, who had, in spite of much opposition, secured his appointment as Minister of War of the Empire in 1911, where he served until 1912, when he was obligated to resign after only a little over a year. In this position, he tried to modernize the army, obtaining many political enemies in the process. Among his few successes was an increase of military budget. During World War I, Auffenberg commanded the Fourth Army which won at the Battle of Komar√≥w but was defeated by the Russians during the Battle of Rawa (the \\"six days battle\\"). He was blamed for the defeat, dismissed from the command and replaced by the Archduke Josef Ferdinand. Auffenberg never held a command again. On 22 April 1915 Emperor Franz Joseph I awarded him the title of Freiherr (Baron) with the designation \\"von Komarow,\\" in recognition of his victory at this battle. In April 1915, he was arrested, being suspected that, as War Minister, he delivered to an unauthorized person a copy of military instructions with a view to speculation on the stock exchange, but the court acquitted him. Books Auffenberg wrote two books about the war: * Aus √ñsterreich-Ungarns Teilnahme am Weltkrieg (About Austro-Hungarian participation in the World War), Berlin, Ullstein, 1920. * Aus √ñsterreich- Ungarns H√∂he und Niedergang - Eine Lebensschilderung (About rise and fall of Austria-Hungary - a life description), Munich, 1921.

Made to order in south Gyeongsang Province for the Japanese market. Mishima ware refers to different types of imported and adopted Japanese pottery. Mishima originally refers to the shimamono pottery imported from the islands of Taiwan, Luzon, and \\"Amakawa\\". They were characterized by being roughly-made and often uneven, thus epitomizing the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi. In later centuries, it came to refer to imported ceramics (Gohon) from Korea with the slip inlay style. This style was imitated and produced locally in Japan.  Shimamono Mishima  As described in the T≈çkik≈ç, Mishima (literally \\"three islands\\") originally referred to shimamono pottery imported from the islands of indigenous Taiwan, Luzon, and \\"Amakawa\\" (location unknown). Luzon Mishima (Rusuntsubo) were usually made from purple-black clay and usually had a green glaze. Native Taiwanese Mishima (Hagi Mishima) were made from light-colored clay and were decorated with a row of round knobs and had black marks on the bottom. Amakawa Mishima are made from white clay with a gray-colored glaze.  Korean Mishima  In the 17th century, it was applied to the imported Korean slip inlay style pottery from Buncheong (then known specifically as Gohon), made at the instigation of the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu. The style of which goes back to Goryeo (935-1392) when bowls decorated in this way were known as Korai-jawan or Korai tea bowls. It was later imitated by kilns in Yamashiro Province. The copies were often imperfect, which is probably why they were later classified along with the traditional Mishima ware. In Gohon Mishima ware, bowls were inlaid with various motifs such as floral and animal depictions. To create these motifs, a potter would begin by engraving the design in the body. Next, the engravings would be filled with contrasting colored clay (or slip). Finally, the bowl is then covered it with a transparent glaze. This technique peaked in Korea during the 12th and 13th-century Goryeo celadons, deemed \\"first under heaven.\\" It is also referred to as . Another inlay style is called reverse inlay. With this technique, the potter cuts away the background, leaving the design in relief. Then, with the design established, the background is brushed over with a slip.

The village is most famous for the temple Manappullikavu Vela. Sree Manappully Bhagavathy Temple is situated very near to the Palghat Town. It is on the Palghat‚ÄìChittur road and hardly 200 meters away from the NH-47. Earlier the temple was under the private ownership of ‚ÄòKenath Family‚Äô. Now the temple is under Malabar Devaswom Board (MDB). Kariyannur Manakkal Bavathrathan Namboothiripad of Pattambi is the Thanthri (Head Priest) of the temple now. Sri Manappully Bhagavathy Temple has a very ancient history. It is believed that the temple originally belonged to Sri Mattappilly Bhadrakali Mana, a famous Kerala Brahmin family of Kerala. Numerous Bhrahmin families living on the banks of Holi River Sokanasini (Bharathapuzha) used to perform ‚ÄòYagas‚Äô on the river bed. Thus the area came to be known as ‚ÄòYaga-kara‚Äô which later came to be known as ‚ÄòYakkara‚Äô. The eastern part of Yakkara where the temple is located, is called East Yakkara and the other side as ‚ÄòWest Yakkara‚Äô. It is believed that the ‚ÄòMoolasthanam‚Äô of Bhagavathy was at West Yakkara and it was subsequently shifted to the present Sanctum Santorum of the East Yakkara temple. (It is believed that a saintly Brahmin of Yagakkara conducted his prayers in his kitchen which is also called as ‚Äòmadappalli‚Äô. It is considered that in the course of time and usage, the area came to be known as \\"Manappulli\\"). Sree Manappulli Bhagavathi is Bhadrakaali and was born out of the sacred \\"Jada\\" of Lord Shiva during Dakshayaga. She is black in colour, with four hands, each one having Soolam, Kapalam, Gadkam and Khedam. She is with three eyes, two ‚ÄòDhamshtram‚Äô, with ‚ÄòPattudayada‚Äô and valuable ornaments. The Prathishta is in ‚ÄòShanta Bhava‚Äô. During ‚ÄòChandattam‚Äô ceremony She turns to ‚ÄòRudra Bhava‚Äô and becomes ‚ÄòShanta Swaroopini ‚Äòafter accepting the ‚ÄòKadummadura Payasa Nivedyam‚Äô. She is believed to satisfy the desires, hopes and aspirations of her true devotees and also protect them from all evils. According to a legendary myth about the temple, an Asura called Neelan was disturbing the people with his misdeeds and became a menace to them. The people, complained about this to Parasuraman and he in turn sought a remedy from Lord Paramasiva. Paramasiva incarnating his female personality to Bhadra Kali and sent her to Akamalavaram to kill Neelan. After killing Neelan, Kali became Manappulli Bhagavathy showering prosperity to her devotees. The Palghat district where the temple is situated, has mainly paddy cultivation as the main occupation of the people. The district is called the ‚ÄòRice Bowl‚Äô of Kerala. The social and cultural customs of the people are, therefore, one way or other, connected with paddy cultivation. They believe that the Goddesses of ‚ÄòKavu‚Äô (temple) protect them in their ‚ÄòThattakam‚Äô (meaning the area where they live, surrounds the ‚ÄòKavu‚Äô). The people make offerings to the Goddesses in their ‚ÄòThattakam‚Äô in the form agricultural produces having bearing on the seasonal agriculture. The people prayed for good harvest and as an offering for this, they celebrates ‚ÄòKathir‚Äô in the third Friday of the Malayalam month of ‚ÄòVrichikam‚Äô. On this day, a procession carrying ‚ÄòSarodam‚Äô, in a very ornately decorated form is taken out in the evening from the premises of Lord Muniyappan temple, situated at the southern side of the Bhagavathy temple and it culminates at the Manappully Bhagavathy temple at dusk, passing through the streets of Manappullikavu Nair Thara. Another procession from Kenathuparambu, also joins the procession at the Manappullikavu junction and culminates at the temple. An attractive part of this ‚ÄòKathir‚Äô is the procession carrying decorative umbrellas made of palm leaves tied to freshly cut bamboo poles accompanied by ‚Äòdrum beating‚Äô. The Kathir literally announces the ensuing ‚ÄòVela‚Äô festival. The procession also carries ‚ÄòKathir Koodu‚Äô, small balls made of tender palm leaves containing freshly plucked ‚ÄòNel kathir‚Äô (paddy bunches) which are distributed to all the houses in the area and hung in the front yard of each house till the next ‚ÄòKathir‚Äô. These practices continue to be observed even now with great pomp and show. After the ‚ÄòKathir‚Äô, the next preparatory function of the Vela is ‚ÄòKanyar‚Äô (Kodiyettam), which is performed on the first Friday of the Malayalam Month ‚ÄòKumbam‚Äô. The huge freshly cut bamboo pole (flag post) with a typical flag - Koora is hoisted in front of the temple with rituals. This declares and denotes the ensuing Manappully Bhagavathy Vela. Festivals Sree Manapullikavu Vela Some of the major festivals here are Vishu, Onam, Diwali & the great Manapulli Vela. This place is also well known for its temple processions, which would be normally conducted with nearly seventeen tuskers in minimum. The Manapulli Vela is glorified also by the firework displays, panchavadya-performances, Kathakali, Ootam Thullal, Katha Prasangam and various other cultural arts. As mentioned, the Vela is celebrated between last week of February and first week of March based on the Malayalam Calendar year. ‚ÄòKanyar‚Äô is conducted on the Ist Friday of the Malayalam month ‚ÄòKumbam‚Äô and the Vela is invariably conducted on the 14th day after ‚ÄòKanyar‚Äô (Kodiyettam). A Vela Committee is constituted for the proper conduct of the Vela Festival. The entire expenditure for the festival is met from donations received from the devotees. After the Kodiyettam, many cultural events are organised in the evenings for 14 days culminating on the day of Vela, by renowned folk/cultural artists of the state which attract huge crowds. Lot of devotees from various places come and worship Bhagavathy on Vela day. The Vela day starts early with special poojas and in the afternoon, Bhagavathy starts her vela procession. It is considered that on the invitation extended by the ‚ÄòDesakkar‚Äô (locals) with ‚ÄòUpacharam Chollal‚Äô, Bhagavathy comes out of the ‚ÄòSanctum Sanctorum‚Äô for the ‚ÄòVela Procession‚Äô, mixing up with her devotees for uniting her ‚ÄòThattakam‚Äô and eliminating all the evils. It is noted that on Vela day, neither the usual ‚ÄòDeeparadhana‚Äô nor the ‚ÄòAthazhapuja‚Äô is performed, as Bhagavathy is celebrating Vela with the ‚ÄòDesakkar‚Äô. The ‚ÄòDeeparadhana and ‚ÄòAthazhapuja‚Äô of Vela day will be performed on the next day after ‚ÄòSudhi‚Äô (cleansing ceremony). The ‚ÄòChaandh Abishekam‚Äô, one of the important pooja during the Vela day, attracts flocks of devotees. ‚ÄòVedikettu‚Äô (Fireworks) is also an important attractive element of the festival which takes place in the late evening when the Vela procession reaches back to the temple from Fort Maidan and also in the early morning. Bhagavathy is very fond of fire works as she is considered to be born from the Jada of Paramasiva with fire and thunder. On the Vela day the ‚Äònada‚Äô is opened only after Karimarunnu is lit in front of Bhagavathy‚Äô. Annadanam‚Äô (offering of food) is conducted in which thousands of devotees take part. The day of Vela is declared as a local holiday by the government which shows the importance of the festival. Other significant features of the Vela is the other Velas from other desams (areas) such as West Yakkara, Vadakkanthara, Vennakkara, and Koppam which also congregate at the Fort Maidan. While the East Yakkara Manappullikavu Vela remains separate at the fort entrance gate when the ‚ÄòPanchavadyam‚Äô is in full swing. The East Yakkara Manappulli Bhaghavathy Vela consisting of the famous caparisoned Elephants, folk arts, Panchavadyam etc., reach back to the temple. Plenty of chariots (Bullock carts and other motorised vehicles) also form part of the Vela procession. When the Vela return to the temple, the ‚ÄòPanchavadyam‚Äô reaches its mesmerising peak making the people literally dance and jump. After this, the spectacular fireworks starts, leaving the huge crowd spellbound. A vast sea of humanity assembles at the temple premises to witness this spectacular show. After the Fireworks, the renowned ‚ÄòPandimelam‚Äô performed by hundreds of eminent artists begins. At midnight stage programmes will be performed. Early morning, the ‚ÄòRaavela‚Äô starts. The highlight of ‚ÄòRaavela‚Äô is lighting of ‚ÄòKambam‚Äô. ‚ÄòKambam‚Äô is considered as ‚ÄòParamasivas‚Äô Jada and lighting it with ‚ÄòKarimarunnu‚Äô makes symbolic representation of Bhadrakalis‚Äô ulpathi. After this, Bhagavathy enters the Temple. The ‚ÄòKanyar‚Äô pole is plucked by Elephant to mark the end of the festival. Sudhi is performed as Bhagavathy was outside the shrine with the devotees to celebrate her Vela. ‚ÄòEeduvedi‚Äô announces the conclusion of Vela. It is believed that after the evening Aarthi Bhagawathy goes to the Moolasthanam which is behind the present main temple (2 km) and returns to the Main Temple in the Morning. Also the Easwara Pooja for Bhairavar is very special and by performing Muttu at Bhairavar keeps the Evil forces away - The Ultimate Protection. Manappalli Bhagawathy is the family deity and so followers perform the Pooja and do an offering before starting any function such as marriage; after the marriage the newlyweds go to the temple and take the blessings.

A 25-year veteran of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), he is best known for his criticism of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the influence it has played on DEA operations. Levine has claimed the CIA was instrumental in the creation of the Bolvian drug cartel La Corporaci√≥n, which he called the \\"General Motors of cocaine\\".  Career Levine has testified as an expert witness in 500 civil and criminal trials in the US and abroad, and has lectured on Undercover Operations and Human Intelligence for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's advanced undercover seminar, the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Levine's career as an undercover agent first became public with the publication of his DEA-authorized biography in March 1988, Undercover. In March 1988, Levine wrote a letter to the New York Daily News about how he wanted to arrest Howard Stern after Stern had been joking on the radio about drugs being used backstage before his pay-per-view show Howard Stern's Neglige√© and Underpants Party. Special Agent in Charge for the New York City office of the DEA Robert Stutman denied any investigation into Stern and said \\"Levine's letter was written without the agency's knowledge.\\"New York Daily News March 10th, 1988 However, in Levine's follow-up book Deep Cover, Levine claimed that the letter to Daily News as well as the Stern investigation had not only been authorized by DEA and the Department of Justice, but that Stern's media clout had caused the DEA to back down from the investigation.Levine, Michael (1990). Deep Cover: The Inside Story of How DEA Infighting, Incompetence and Subterfuge Lost Us the Biggest Battle of the Drug War, Delacorte Press, New York. ; Also in Deep Cover, Levine claimed that Edwin Meese, the then United States Attorney General, had unmasked a DEA undercover team, posing as a Mafia family, that had penetrated the office of the President of Mexico and was \\"buying\\" Mexican military protection for the transportation of 15 tons of cocaine through Mexico into the United States. In May 2011, Evo Morales, the President of Bolivia, held up Levine's book La Guerra Falsa for the press to photograph, citing it as justification for his expelling the DEA from Bolivia on what he said was the basis of DEA using the war on drugs to manipulate the Bolivian government. La Guerra Falsa, was the Spanish translation of Levine's The Big White Lie. Levine replied in several articles that, \\"if President Morales had read the book he would have welcomed DEA as heroes and booted CIA from his country for betraying both the Bolivian and American people\\". Since 1995 he has co-hosted The Expert Witness Radio Show with musician Mark Marshall on the Pacifica Radio Network station WBAI-FM in New York. On August 11 2008, Levine was featured on The Colbert Report in a segment entitled \\"Nailed 'Em,\\" which pokes fun at the American justice system for law enforcement activity that some would consider trivial or frivolous. The episode focused on a medical marijuana patient who was denied a job for failing a drug test. Levine has also been featured as an expert commentator on Dateline NBC, The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, Inside Edition, 60 Minutes, Crier Report, The Geraldo Rivera Show, Crossfire, Good Morning America, NBC and CBS morning shows, Cold Blood, The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch, Charlie Rose, Bill Moyers' Project Censored, and Contrapunto (Crossfires Spanish language version).

Hans Mattson (December 23, 1832, √ñnnestad ‚Äì March 5, 1893) was a Swedish American politician. He served with distinction as a colonel in the American Civil War (1861-65) and in 1869 became the Minnesota Secretary of State. He later served as United States Consul General in India. Biography Matttson was born on a small farm in the parish of √ñnnestad in Sk√•ne, Sweden. In 1851, he immigrated to the U.S. with a friend. He settled on a farm in an established Swedish community in Illinois in 1853 and brought his family from Sweden to join him. In August 1853, Mattson led a group of several hundred Swedish immigrants to settle in Goodhue County, Minnesota.Vasa: Mattson‚Äôs Settlement (Minnesota Historical Markers) The settlement was soon known as Vasa, and it became home to prominent Swedish Americans including Governor John Lind. Mattson left in 1856 for Red Wing. Shortly after moving to Red Wing, Mattson was financially ruined by the panic of 1857. He and his wife, Cherstin (Peterson) Mattson (1837-1911) had to start over. After getting on his feet again, Mattson was admitted to the Minnesota State Bar and entered public life. He was elected city clerk of Red Wing in 1859 before becoming Goodhue County auditor. At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Mattson raised a company of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants to fight for the Union. Mattson earned the rank of Colonel for his leadership of the 3rd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He returned to Red Wing at the end of the war in 1865. After returning to Minnesota, Mattson began his work as an immigration booster. First he worked for private railroad companies. He started with the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad, where he worked as a protection agent to greet Swedish and Norwegian arrivals in Chicago. Building on his experience, in 1866, Mattson proposed the creation of a state Board of Immigration. The board would recruit immigrants to homestead land in Minnesota. Until the 1880s, immigration to the U.S. was regulated by states rather than the federal government. In 1867, Governor William Rainey Marshall established the board and named Mattson to be its first secretary. The state was especially interested in recruiting Scandinavian immigrants. Mattson returned to Sweden as representative of the Minnesota Immigration Board in 1867 and 1868 to recruit settlers, a successful undertaking. He returned again several times in the 1870s as emigrant agent for the Northern Pacific Railroad. These visits are described in his memoirs Reminiscences: the story of an emigrant, which were published in both English and Swedish in 1891. As a booster, Mattson promoted Minnesota in Sweden and Norway. He also promoted the state to Scandinavian immigrant communities in the Eastern U.S. Mattson recruited immigrants to Minnesota by several means. He wrote for Swedish American newspapers; he encouraged immigrants to write letters to friends and family in Europe; and he published pamphlets about the benefits of Minnesota. During the course of his life, Mattson founded several Swedish newspapers in Chicago and Minneapolis, including the Minnesota Stats Tidning. In 1870, Mattson was asked to run for Minnesota Secretary of State. Scandinavian influence in Minnesota was growing, and the Republican Party sought Swedish and Norwegian immigrants as candidates for office. Mattson was elected, becoming the first Swedish American elected to office in Minnesota. Mattson left the position in 1872, but he was re-elected and served again from 1887-1891. As a politician, Mattson promoted pan-Scandinavian unity, even though Swedish and Norwegian immigrants often were at odds. In between his stints as Secretary of State, Mattson lived outside the U.S. He took his family to Sweden in the spring of 1871. He remained in Sweden for five years as a booster. From 1881-1883, Mattson served as U.S. Consul General in India. President James A. Garfield offered him a diplomatic post because Mattson had become one of the most prominent Swedish Americans in U.S. politics. Aside from these trips abroad, Mattson lived most of his later life in Minneapolis where he died in 1893.\\"Hans Mattson Dead,\\" St. Paul Daily Globe, March 6, 1893.

The book explains the many practical applications of this typological model Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type using four categories of psychological type differences - Extraversion / Introversion; Sensing / Intuition; Thinking / Feeling; Judging / Perceiving. The book also suggests how different combinations of these characteristics tend to influence the ways people perceive the world and how they both respond to and interact with it. Type tables show how type preferences tend to correlate with occupational interests. Profiles of the sixteen types also suggest how people of each type tend to act and relate to people with other type dynamics. Every year over 2.5 million people take the MBTI assessment and it has become the most widely used personality questionnaire in history. Over 150,000 copies of Gifts Differing have been sold.

History Originally started in 1960 by Wellington \\"Duke\\" DeCoursey who moved to Thompson from Dauphin, Manitoba, where he published the Central Manitoba News. DeCoursey started other local newspapers, including the News of the North (in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories) and the Birch River Reporter, as well as authoring books on Canada's north and early Alberta. The newspaper changed from being a weekly publication to printing four editions a week by 1966, before regressing back to a weekly. Duke and Maude DeCoursey published the newspaper until 1971 when it was amalgamated with the Nickel Belt News forming Precambrian Press, which was the DeCoursey family and the Grant Wright family. Duke and Maude moved to Squamish, British Columbia, to develop a mobile home park in 1973, selling their shares in Precambrian Press. Maude died in 1993 and Duke died in 1994. The Nickel Belt News and the Thompson Citizen are the main providers for local news in Thompson. Grant and Joan Wright ran the operation with their kids until a few years back when Grant died. Joan left most of the operations to Carolyn Wright, who was the managing editor for a number of years. On January 2, 2007, Precambrian Press sold the Thompson Citizen to Boundary Publishers of Estevan, Saskatchewan, which was later purchased by Glacier Media. Donna Wilson was named the general manager of the Thompson Citizen and the Nickel Belt News in 2007 by publisher Brant Kersey. Wilson later resigned from the Thompson Citizen in 2010 to join Rogers. On January 2, 2009, the newspaper became free to area residents. In April 2009, the newspaper established a website to accommodate its out-of-town readers and to be able to break news as it happens.

She began her nursing career as a tuberculosis nurse in Baltimore, Maryland, and in 1915 volunteered as one of the first American war nurses to go to Europe and treat soldiers in World War I. In Belgium she served in a French field hospital, keeping a bitter diary detailing the horrors that she witnessed daily. Back in America, she turned her diary into a book, The Backwash of War (1916), containing fourteen vignettes of typical scenes. Despite early success, the brutal imagery was unpalatable and the book was suppressed and not republished until 1934. During her time in Paris during the war La Motte formed a close friendship with the American expat writer Gertrude Stein. Researchers have speculated that Ernest Hemingway's influential unadorned style may have been influenced by La Motte's own writing, through Stein's mentoring. After the war, La Motte travelled to Asia, where she witnessed the horrors of opium addiction. These travels provided her with material for six books, three of them explicitly dealing with the opium problem: Peking Dust (1919), Civilization: Tales of the Orient (1919), Opium Monopoly (1920), Ethics of Opium (1922), Snuffs and Butters (1925) and Opium in Geneva: Or How The Opium Problem is Handled by the League of Nations (1929).

He achieved some fame as an Irish patriot when he was brutally executed for independence activities by a pro-British nobleman in 1798.  Name  Most commonly known as Staker Wallace or The Staker, his first name was most likely Patrick. His nickname was given to him after death. Some sources give his first name as William or Edmond (Edmund), but these are less likely than Patrick. In her 1909 book about her ancestor, Eunice Graham Brandt referred to Staker as William. After being beheaded, his head was put on a stake for everyone to see. Thus, Staker Wallace. The monument in his honour in Martinstown, Limerick, refers to him as Edmond. Unfortunately, contemporary news accounts in the Limerick Chronicle are long-lost. Nonetheless, his correct first name can be established from other sources.Mainchin Seoighe, Staker Wallis: His Life and Times and Death, 1994, pp. 7‚Äì8, 43, 52‚Äì54. According to traditional Irish naming patterns, the first- born son was named after his paternal grandfather. Both of Staker's sons named their first-born sons Patrick. A history of Limerick published in 1866 included a list of sentences passed by the General Court Martial in Limerick on 4 July 1798. Included on the list: \\"Patrick Wallis, for collecting subscriptions for procuring the assassination of Chas. S. Oliver, Esq., to be hanged at Kilfinane, his head to be affixed on one of his own pikes, and placed on the castle.\\" A document on the United Irishmen in Limerick found in the 1940s in the Irish State Paper Office listed prisoners in the new gaol (jail) in 1798. Ten of those listed had been executed, including a Patrick Wallis.Maurice Lenihan, History of Limerick, 1866, reprint 1967, p. 405; Richard Hayes, \\"Some Notes on the United Irishmen and Limerick,\\" North Munster Antiquarian Journal, vol. III, 1942, p. 118; both cited in Seoighe. Wallis and Wallace are interchangeable spellings of his surname. Both were used in County Limerick at the time.Kilfinane and Bulgaden-Ballinvana parish baptism and marriage records, accessed by professional genealogist John McDermot, National Library of Ireland, January‚ÄìFebruary 2009.  Background  Patrick Wallace's extended family had lived in the southeast parishes of County Limerick for generations. He married Hanora Riordan of Glenroe in 1758 and had five children: William, Patrick Jr., Mary, Joan (Jane), and Hanora. Wallace was a small farmer in his 60s when he became involved in revolutionary activities.  Involvement in 1798 rebellion  Wallace was involved in the disturbances leading up to the 1798 rebellion in Ireland, and was hung as a local captain of the United Irishmen. \\"Staker\\" Wallace was arrested in late March 1798. He was charged with being a disloyal revolutionary and plotting the assassination of Captain Charles Silver Oliver. On 21 April 1798, Wallace was publicly flogged at a cattle fair at Ballinvreena. One account makes it sound as though he was hanged, drawn and quartered, and finally beheaded immediately afterwards, when the torture failed to yield the desired results. Another source says he was executed in July 1798. He died in the town of Kilfinane. His nickname may derive from the fact that his severed head was placed on a stake to serve as a warning to others, although it more likely preceded his execution and was linked to stakes used in connection with the commonages. His body was buried at the Abbey burial grounds, Glenroe-Ballyorgan parish, County Limerick. Wallace may have been a local leader of a group known as the Whiteboys. They dressed up in sheets at night and rooted up the hedges with which landlords had enclosed land formerly held in common by the community. This was a change designed to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor. The change was also seen as a further insult to traditional Irish culture perpetrated by those loyal to the British empire. The Society of United Irishmen and the Whiteboys were efforts by Roman Catholics and Irish nationalists to gain independence from the English.  Relatives  In the 1850s, many of Staker's grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and collateral relatives emigrated to Kane County, Illinois, USA, a rural area west of Chicago. They used the \\"Wallace\\" spelling of the name, rather than the \\"Wallis\\" spelling which was often, but not exclusively, used back home. Several are buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Gilberts, Rutland Township, Kane County.http://usgwarchives.net/il/kane/cemeteries/stmarysback.html.  In culture  There is a traditional Irish ballad about Patrick Wallace called \\"Death of Staker Wallace\\" or \\"Lament for Staker Wallace\\" (title variant: Wallis). Its melody is known but only a few of its lyrics survive. It is an air traditionally associated with the uilleann pipes. A version of the air, played by fiddler Eileen Ivers, appears in the soundtrack of the Martin Scorsese film Gangs of New York (2002). However, \\"Lament for Staker Wallace\\" does not appear on the film's original soundtrack CD.

The game centers on Bozo, a drunkard trying to get home safely after spending a night at a bar.  Gameplay  Bozo can run into many obstacles on his journey home; he can fall into trap doors, get caught by the police, run into people, and even run into ghosts and dragons. If Bozo can successfully get home, he drinks five more pints the next night at his pub \\"Gibbo's Joint\\" and this process repeats until the Bozo reaches 60 pints. As Bozo drinks, the controls get looser and he starts to see pink elephants. The effects of increasing difficulty include more pedestrians which the player needs to evade (all of which automatically end the night by either attacking him or jailing him), manhole covers disappear with increasing variation, Bozo staggers more making walking in a straight line near impossible without repeated intervention which in itself is hard. If Bozo cannot successfully get home he loses anywhere from one to five pints, and the game starts over if Bozo runs out of his pints of drunkenness. Getting home with 60 pints (the game does not automatically end at 60 pints) results in the player receiving a \\"Bozo Rotten Liver Award\\" and the game ending on a screen of a hospital bed. Development  Ideas which were considered during development included using a display to indicate how full the character's bladder was, and to require that it would have to be emptied on occasion. References to alcohol were mostly removed from the game with the drinks being described as 'wobble juice', although there were still some names on the high score table which were obvious allusions to well known brands.http://www.the-commodore- zone.com/articlelive/articles/6/4/Is-the-Force-with-Tasksets- Skywalker/Page4.html Bozo's Night Out was bundled with a registration card, which could be mailed back to Taskset for information regarding any future releases from Taskset.

The film had a total of 627,164 admissions in France.http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=9087 While the film does not acknowledge any literary sources, it is loosely based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley. Chabrol's screenwriter, Paul G√©gauff, had adapted the Highsmith novel into Purple Noon in 1960. Les biches switches the gender of the main characters. Plot On the Pont des Arts in Paris, a rich and beautiful woman, Fr√©d√©rique, picks up a penniless female street artist called \\"Why\\". Fr√©d√©rique seduces Why and takes her to her villa in Saint Tropez. The villa is occupied by two gay friends of Fr√©d√©rique, Robegue and Riasis. At a party, Why meets an architect, Paul Thomas.

The organization provides education, support, and resources to activist groups. The Peace Center aims to strategically link organizations to establish \\"structures and relationships that are nonviolent, non-hierarchical, humane and just.\\"Washington Peace Center, History History The Washington Peace Center grew from The Vigil to Stop Biological Weapons at Fort Detrick, which was maintained in Frederick, Maryland from 1959 through 1961. In 1961 vigil coordinator Larry Scott and other vigilers moved to the nation's capital to start the Washington Peace Action Center. Activists from the Peace Action Center vigiled at the White House calling for a ban on all testing of nuclear weapons, a major Cold War issue at that time. The PAC also contributed to local mobilizing for the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Justice. The ratification of the Partial Test Ban Treaty between the US, USSR and Great Britain led to the dissolution of The Peace Action Center in 1963. Left in its place was the Washington Peace Center, a non-profit organization housed (until 1997) in the Friends Meeting of Washington and initially directed by Gelston MacNeil, a Quaker pacifist and activist. The Center sought to educate the public on peace issues through film screenings, discussions, and the publication of a local newsletter. The Peace Center quickly became a hub for organizing against the Vietnam War and helped to coordinate draft counseling in the Washington area. During the 1970s the Center continued its work by supporting the movements against nuclear power and for nuclear disarmament. In the 1980s the Peace Center served as the local nexus for national and international opposition to the arms race and played a vital role in organizing resistance to the Reagan administration's interventions in Central America. The 1990s saw the Center contributing to social justice movements in opposition to racism and for justice for gay, lesbian, and transgender people. In the 2000s, the Center was involved with opposing the invasion and occupation of Iraq, countering military recruiters and attempting to institute a peace curriculum in area public schools, as well as working to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, ending torture and restoring civil liberties at home. Currently, the Peace Center fiscally sponsors several activist organizations in Washington D.C. including Witness Against Torture, the Fort Reno Summer Concert Series, the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Peace Committee, Positive Force, and the Civilian-Soldier Alliance, allowing these groups to raise funds without 501(c)(3) status.Sponsored Projects, Washington Peace Center The Center organizes and hosts monthly skillshares as part of the DC Trainers Network in order to strengthen progressive social movements in Washington D.C.DC Trainers Network Washington Peace Center As the Center's current website states, the summation of all of these efforts is that, \\"We envision a world based on respect for people and the planet that is achieved through nonviolence, peace and social justice.\\"About, Washington Peace Center As a local grassroots organization working in the political milieu of Washington, DC, the Peace Center has always faced the unique challenge of balancing the competing impulses of national organizations oriented toward using Washington as a stage for major demonstrations with the concerns of local activists working to confront the symptoms of global injustice in the environs of DC. Now in its fifth decade the Center is a not- for-profit organization with an eleven-member board of directors. The Center works on a variety of peace and social justice issues locally, nationally, and globally. The Center publishes the \\"Washington Peace Letter\\" bi-annually.Peace Letter Info. Washington Peace Center It distributes the free publication to libraries, coffee shops and other public places throughout the District of Columbia and mails the publication to its members throughout the greater Washington metropolitan area.

He saw service during World War I. Personal life Brudermann was the youngest of the four children of Generalmajor (Major General) Rudolf Johann von Brudermann (1810‚Äì1889) and his wife Gisela von Barbaczy (1815‚Äì1855), who had two other sons, Anton (1847‚Äì1881) and Rudolf (1851‚Äì1941), and a daughter, Gisela Elisabeth (1852‚Äì1917). His brothers also pursued a military career. On 6 March 1886 he married Franziska Juliane (n√©e Strzygowski) in Biala Amalie, with whom he had three daughters and a son. Military career Brudermann began his military training at the Kadettenanstalt (Cadet Institute) in Marburg an der Drau and then, as his two older brothers had done previously, entered the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in 1869. In 1874 he completed his studies at the academy and entered service as a Leutnant (lieutenant) with Uhlan Regiment No. 1. After receiving promotions to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) on 1 May 1879 and Hauptmann 2.Klasse (captain second class) on 1 November 1889 and an award of the Knight's Cross First Class of the Albert Order from the Kingdom of Saxony, he became an instructor at the military riding school ‚Äî the training school for riding instructors ‚Äî on 1 May 1890. He remained there, with the exception of a few interruptions for service with the 1st Uhlan Regiment between 1894 and April 1899 ‚Äî until 20 July 1904. He became a well-known riding instructor, and received both the Military Merit Cross Third Class in 1894 and the Bronze Military Merit Medal (Signum Laudis) in September 1904 for his success as an instructor. He also received a number of awards from foreign governments ‚Äî the Royal Order of the Crown Third Class from the Kingdom of Prussia in April 1893, the Order of the White Elephant Fourth Class from Siam in January 1898, the Order of the Red Eagle Third Class from the Kingdom of Prussia in October 1898, the Officer's Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau from the Netherlands in December 1903, and the Commander's Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy from the Kingdom of Italy in January 1904 ‚Äî in recognition of his horsemanship. After he was promoted to major on 1 May 1897 and to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 November 1900, Brudermann's tour as an instructor at the riding school finally ended when he became the commanding officer of the 2nd Uhlan Regiment at the end of July 1904. On 5 November 1904, he was promoted to Oberst (colonel). As was customary, he received the Order of the Iron Crown Third Class in August 1908 after three years of satisfactory leadership of his regiment. In April 1910, Brudermann took command of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in Marburg an der Drau, and he was promoted to Generalmajor (major general) on 28 October 1910. He was appointed commander of the 3rd Cavalry Division in Vienna in June 1913, and on 3 November 1913 he was promoted to Feldmarschalleutnant (lieutenant field marshal). Achieving this rank and the command of a division was extremely unusual for an officer who had not attended the war college. Under normal circumstances, this achievement would have been the peak of his career and he would have retired after 40 years of service, but the outbreak of World War I extended his military career. First World War After World War I began with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, Brudermann remained the commander of the 3rd Cavalry Division. In June 1916, while retaining command of the division, he also became the commanding officer of Cavalry Corps Brudermann, which was established that month. It suffered terrible losses in combat and was disbanded in August 1916. In October 1916, again while remaining in command of the 3rd Cavalry Division, he raised a new Cavalry Corps Brudermann, but it was disbanded in November 1916, again due to heavy losses. His deteriorating health forced him to give up his command of the 3rd Cavalry Division at the end of 1916 and to apply for retirement, which was approved in March 1917. He retired with the rank of General der Kavallerie mit Titel und Charakter (\\"general of the cavalry with title and character\\"). Later life After retiring, Brudermann withdrew from public life. He lived in seclusion in Vienna near his brother Rudolf ‚Äî also a retired General der Kavallerie and a popular figure at veterans events ‚Äî and became known as ‚Äúthe other Brudermann.\\" He died on 26 October 1945, shortly after the end of World War II.

This reaction provides the largest part of the one-carbon units available to the cell. Structure The structure of the SHMT monomer is similar across prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but whereas the active enzyme is a dimer in prokaryotes, the enzyme exists as a tetramer in eukaryotic cells, though the evolutionary basis for this difference in structure is unknown. However, the evolutionary path taken by SHMT going from prokaryotic dimeric form to the eukaryotic tetrameric form can be easily seen as a sort of doubling event. In other words, the eukaryotic SHMT tetramer resembles two prokaryotic dimers that have packed together, forming what has been described as a ‚Äúdimer of dimers.‚Äù The interaction between two monomers within a dimer subunit has been found to occur over a greater contact area and is thus much tighter than the interaction between the two dimers. Human Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) regulates one-carbon transfer reactions required for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and the regulated switch between dimeric and tetrameric forms of SHMT2, which is induced by Pyridoxal phosphate, has recently been shown to be involved in regulation of the BRISC deubiqutylase complex, linking metabolism to inflammation. The SHMT2 dimer, but not the PLP-bound tetramer, is a potent inhibitor of the multimeric BRISC complex, revealing a potential mechanism for SHMT2 regulation of inflammation A single SHMT monomer can be subdivided into three domains: an N-terminus ‚Äúarm,‚Äù a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù domain, and a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù domain. The N-terminus arm appears to maintain the tight interaction between two monomers. The arm, consisting of two alpha helices and a beta sheet, wraps around the other monomer when in oligomeric form. The ‚Äúlarge‚Äù domain contains the PLP binding site, as seen in other PLP-dependent proteins, like aspartate aminotransferase. The large domain in the eukaryotic form also contains a histidine that is essential for tetramer stability. All four histidines of these residues, one from each monomer, sit at the center of the tetrameric complex, where two histidines from a dimeric subunit engages in stacking interactions with the histidines of the other subunit. Prokaryotic SHMT has a proline residue rather than histidine in the equivalent position, which would in part explain why prokaryotic SHMT does not form tetramers. The active site structure is highly conserved across eukaryotic and prokaryotic forms. The PLP is anchored by means of a lysine, which forms an aldimine Schiff base linkage with the PLP aldehyde. It has been hypothesized that a nearby tyrosine functions as the proton donor and acceptor during the transadimination step as well as the formyl transfer step and that an arginine residue engages the tyrosine side chain in a cation‚ÄìœÄ interaction, which helps to lower the pK of the tyrosine, lowering the barrier for proton transfer. Mechanism The mechanism commonly ascribed to SHMT enzymatic activity is a transamidation followed by a cleavage of amino acid side chain from the backbone. The N-terminal amine of serine makes a nucleophilic attack on the aldimine between the SHMT lysine (Internal Aldimine) and the PLP aldehyde to form a gem-diamine, and then the N-terminal amine lone pair comes down to displace the lysine, forming a new aldimine, this time with the serine (External Aldimine). It is believed that a nearby tyrosine is responsible for much of the proton transfers that occur during the transaldimination. Once the serine is bonded to PLP, PLP triggers the Œ±-elimination of the hydroxymethyl group of the substrate (serine). This group is released as a formaldehyde molecule because a nearby glutamate abstracts the proton from the hydroxyl group. Afterwards, the nucleophilic amine on THF attacks the free formaldehyde intermediate to make the carbinolamine intermediate. In the second case, the nucleophilic amines on THF attack the serine side chain carbon, simultaneously forming a carbinolamine intermediate on the THF and a quinoid intermediate with the PLP. However, THF is not an obligate substrate for SHMT, meaning the cleavage of serine and other √ü-hydroxy amino acids (such as threonine) can occur without the presence of THF and, in this case, the mechanism is a retro-aldol cleavage. Also, it seems that the subsequent dehydration of the carbinolamine intermediate to form the methylene bridge and fully cyclize into 5,10-CH2-THF is not catalyzed by the enzyme and this reaction may occur spontaneously. In fact, this conversion could occur outside the enzyme, but a study shows that this reaction is faster and thermodynamically favourable when occurs inside the SHMT aided by the Glu57 residue. Moreover, the cyclisation of the carbinolamine intermediate to form 5,10-CH2-THF is essential to Glu57 restore its proton that is used to protonate the quinonoid intermediate and complete the catalytic cycle. Clinical significance Folate metabolism has already been the subject of chemotherapeutic strategies, but SHMT inhibition, while researched, had not really been taken advantage of in commercial anticancer drugs. However, because the folates used by folate metabolic and folate dependent enzymes are all very similar in structure and folate mimics already being common in medical use, it has not been difficult to find potential molecular structures that may inhibit SHMT. For example, pemetrexed is already used as an antifolate to treat mesothelioma and was found to be an effective inhibitor of SHMT and screening other antifolates revealed lometrexol as another effective inhibitor of SHMT. SHMT has also undergone investigation as a potential target for antimalarial drugs. Research indicates that the active site environment of Plasmodium SHMTs (PSHMTs) differ from that of human cytosolic SHMT quite a bit, allowing for the possibility of selective inhibition of PSHMT and, thus, the treatment of malaria infections. In particular, certain pyrazolopyran molecules have been shown to have a selective nanomolar efficacy against PSHMTs. Poor pharmacokinetics, however, have prevented these pyrazolopyrans from being effective in living models.  Isoforms  Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus have versions of this enzyme and there appear to be two isoforms of SHMT in mammals, one in the cytoplasm (cSHMT) and another in the mitochondria (mSHMT). Plants may have an additional SHMT isoform within chloroplasts. In mammals, the enzyme is a tetramer of four identical subunits of approximately 50,000 Daltons each. The intact holoenzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 200,000 Daltons and incorporates four molecules of PLP as a coenzyme.  Other reactions  As well as its primary role in folate metabolism, SHMT also catalyzes other reactions that may be biologically significant, including the conversion of 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate to 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate. When coupled with C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase and tetrahydropteroate, cSHMT also catalyzes the conversion of formate to serine.  Role in Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome  Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder that manifests as a complex set of traits including facial abnormalities, unusual behaviors, and developmental delay. It results from an interstitial deletion within chromosome 17p11.2, including the cSHMT gene and a small study showed SHMT activity in SMS patients was ~50% of normal. Reduced SHMT would result in less glycine which could affect the nervous system by acting as an agonist to the NMDA receptor and this could be a mechanism behind SMS.

Later in the century, the famous conductor Hans von B√ºlow would substitute Johannes Brahms for Berlioz. The phrase is generally used in discussions of classical music to refer to the supposed primacy of Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms in the field. Origins In an article in the ', Cornelius introduced Berlioz as the third B, concluding his article with the cheer, \\"Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz!\\" Decades later, B√ºlow composed the following pun to a friend: \\"Mein musikalisches Glaubensbekenntniss steht in Es dur, mit drei B-en in der Vorzeichnung: Bach, Beethoven, und Brahms!\\" B, in German, stands for the note B as well as for the flat sign. The remark may be translated, roughly, as \\"My musical creed is in the key of E-flat major, and contains three Bs [flats] in its key signature: Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms!\\" B√ºlow had been attracted to the idea of a sort of Holy Trinity of classical music for a number of years, writing in the 1880s: \\"I believe in Bach, the Father, Beethoven, the Son, and Brahms, the Holy Ghost of music\\". He further linked Beethoven and Brahms by referring to the latter's First Symphony as Beethoven's Tenth (though Brahms disliked the comparison, thinking it implied plagiarism rather than the homage he had intended). Niccol√≤ Paganini had even earlier (1838) identified Berlioz as the worthy successor of Beethoven.

He was the son of Billy Bates, another notable Yorkshire born cricketer. Life and cricket career Bates was born in Kirkheaton, Yorkshire, England. He played 113 games for his native county between 1907 and 1913, scoring 2,634 runs at 17.32 with a highest score of 81. Although he developed into a fine left arm orthodox spinner, he hardly bowled before World War I, taking two wickets for Yorkshire. He joining Briton Ferry Steel C.C. in 1914, as the War shut down first-class cricket for four years. He served as a sergeant in the Royal Engineers during the war. Bates qualified for Glamorgan over this time, and found a regular spot as a determined opening batsman and useful spinner as cricket resumed after the war. Though he scored a thousand runs in 1923; without reaching a century in 1927, he became the first Glamorgan batsman to record a ton in each innings, with 105 and 111 against Essex. He reached his peak as a batsman in this year, recording a double hundred against Worcestershire at Kidderminster, and another ton against Nottinghamshire to finish the summer with 1,645 runs to his account. He also passed the 1,500 runs mark in 1928, and began a most prolific partnership with a fellow Tyke, Arnold Dyson. The pair took delight in sharing a stand of 233 for the first wicket against Yorkshire, at Sheffield, in 1930. He played 283 first-class matches for Glamorgan, scoring 12,600 runs at 25.97 with ten centuries in all. Bates became a useful left-arm spinner, taking 8 for 93 against Essex in 1928, and was a most reliable fielder close to the wicket. He took 224 wickets for Glamorgan, with a best of 8 for 93, at 37.53. He took 5 wickets in an innings four times. In all first-class cricket, including a game for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, he scored 15,964 runs at 24.4 in 406 matches, and took 230 wickets at 37.7 each. Financial straits, rather than any loss in form, caused Glamorgan to release him in 1931, but he continued to play for Cheshire in the Minor Counties, before turning his hand to coaching and groundsmanship in Ulster where he died in January 1957, aged 72.  Football career  He was also a useful footballer, playing for Bolton Wanderers and Leeds City. His son Ted Bates both played for and managed Southampton.

In 1970, the regiment was amalgamated with the Lancashire Regiment to form the Queen's Lancashire Regiment which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the King's Own Royal Border Regiment and the King's Regiment (Liverpool and Manchester) to form the Duke of Lancaster Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border). History=Formation The Loyal North Lancashire Regiment was formed as part of the Childers Reforms of 1881 by the amalgamation of the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, 81st Regiment of Foot (Loyal Lincoln Volunteers), 3rd Duke of Lancaster's Own Royal Lancashire Militia and the 11th and 14th Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps. The Loyals were one of seven county regiments recruiting in Lancashire. The depot was at Preston, and the regimental district also included the towns of Bolton, Chorley, Farnworth, Hindley, and the Isle of Man. As part of the Cardwell Reforms, the 47th and 81st regiments were linked. The depot for the linked regiment was Fulwood Barracks at Preston. Beginning in 1873, the regiments which would eventually be re-designated as the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment were brigaded together and began moving their depots to Fulwood. However, it would not be until 1877 that the moves were completed when the required facilities were completed. The barracks themselves had been completed in 1848 and served as the station for a number of units between 1848 and 1881. Notably, in the 1860s, it was occupied by the 11th Depot Battalion, which served as depot unit for 11th Hussars and of the 1st/10th, 2nd/10th, 1st/11th, 32nd, 41st and 55th Regiments of Foot. In 1861, Pte Patrick McCaffery, a 19-year-old private soldier with the 32nd (Cornwall) Regiment of Foot shot and killed the Depot's commander, Colonel Hugh Crofton, and Depot's adjutant, Captain John Hanham, with a single shot. The incident began over McCaffery's punishment for failing to vigorously pursue an investigation into some children who had broken some windows at the barracks. McCaffery was tried and convicted at the Liverpool Assizes. He was executed on 11 January 1862. It is claimed that, since that time, his ghost haunts the officer's mess at Fulwood barracks. Boer War, 1899-1902 Robert Kekewich Kimberly. Officers of the 1st Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, c. 1899. In 1899, the Loyal Regiment found itself assigned to South Africa. With hostilities seeming likely in the aftermath of the Jameson Raid, the De Beers company became increasingly concerned with the security of its operations in Kimberly. Although a town guard and other volunteer formations had been raised, the De Beers company and citizens of Kimberly petitioned for additional security measures. On 7 October 1899, an artillery battery and four companies of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment were dispatched to secure the town under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Kekewich. Five days later, with the start of hostilities, Boer forces arrived and began to beisolate Kimberley. For the next 126 days, the North Lancs and the local militias would be cut off and subjected to regular shelling from the Boer artillery. The siege was finally lifted when Brigadier-General Sir John French's Cavalry Division was able to break through the Boer lines on 15 February 1900.George H. Cassar, The Tragedy of Sir John French, (Cranbury, New Jersey: University of Delaware Press., 1985) p. 47-49 With its commander and four of its companies under siege in Kimberly, the balance of the 1st Battalion served with Lord Methuen. Together with the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, 2nd Northampton Regiment, and 2nd King's Own (Yorkshire Light Infantry), they formed the 9th Brigade of the 1st Division. They served with 9th Brigade at the Battles of Belmont, Modder River and Magersfotein. Following the relief of Kimberly in February 1900, the reunited battalion would remain a part of Methuen's command until July, when it was detached to guard Oliphant's Nek. However, on 8 August, they abandoned this task at the orders of Colonel Baden-Powell and left the area unguarded. This allowed Christiaan de Wet to escape the British forces attempting to catch him. Although the Boer escaped, it was ruled that orders received by the Loyals were to blame, and the regiment escaped censure. The end of 1900 found 1st Loyals back with the 9th Brigade. As part of the brigade, they took part in actions around Klerksdorp. Remaining under Lord Methuen's command for the rest of the war, the Loyals provided men to be formed into mounted infantry companies as the war shifted from large engagements into a guerrilla war. The Loyals would continue to serve throughout the guerrilla phase, engaging Boer commandos on a number of occasions until the end of the war with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. Following the end of hostilities, 525 officers and men of the battalion left Cape Town in the SS Carisbrook Castle in September 1902, arriving at Southampton early the following month. Early 20th century The 2nd Battalion had been stationed in the United Kingdom after the amalgamation in 1881, serving in England to 1887, at Jersey 1887-1890, in Ireland 1890-1896, and again in England until 1899. From 1899 there were postings in the Mediterranean, at Malta until 1901, followed by a year at Crete, and from May 1902 at Gibraltar. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and two Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at Avenham Lane in Preston (since demolished) and the 5th Battalion at Fletcher Street in Bolton (both Territorial Force) First World War, 1914‚Äì1918 steel helmets in 1916 Grave Marker in the Cemetery \\"Pr√©mont British Cemetery\\" (France)\\". The Regiment raised a number of extra war service battalions during The Great War. In all the Loyal North Lancs expanded to 21 battalions of infantry for service at home and abroad. Of these, there were the two regular battalions (the 1st and 2nd Battalions), the Special Reserve (former militia) battalion (3rd Battalion), ten Territorial Force battalions (1/4th, 1/5th, 2/4th, 2/5th, 3/4th, 3/5th, 4/5th, 1/12th (Pioneers), 2/12th and 14th Battalions), and seven service battalions of Kitchener's Army (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th (Reserve) and 15th Battalions), as well as a home service battalion (13th (Home Service) Battalion). =Regular Army= The 1st Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 2nd Brigade in the 1st Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. The 2nd Battalion landed at Tanga in German East Africa as part of the 27th Indian Brigade in November 1914 and then moved to Mombasa later in the month for service in East Africa; it was then transferred to Egypt in January 1917 for service in North Africa and to France in May 1918 for service on the Western Front. =Territorial Force= The 1/4th Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 154th Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front.

The 1/12th Battalion (Pioneers) landed at Le Havre as pioneer battalion to the 60th (2/2nd London) Division in June 1916 also for service on the Western Front. =New Army battalions= The 6th (Service) Battalion sailed as part of the 38th Brigade of the 13th (Western) Division to join the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and landed at Anzac Cove on 4 August 1915. After participating in the battles at Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay, the battalion, along with the rest of the division, was withdrawn from Gallipoli and sent to Egypt to refit in January 1916. In February 1916, the division was ordered to move to join the Tigris Corps in its operations to relieve the Anglo-Indian garrison besieged at Kut. As part of the Tigris Corps, the battalion attempted to lift the siege of Kut. Initially deployed along the left bank of the Tigris River, the battalion participated in the Battle of Fallahiya on 6 April 1916 and Battle of Sanniyat on 9 April 1916. The battalion managed to break into the Turkish positions at the Sanniyat, but because follow-on forces were unable to link up with them, they along with the rest of the 38th Brigade were eventually driven back. The battalion were next tasked with seizing the beachhead on the far side of the Diyala River. Approximately 100 men of the battalion were able to make the initial crossing on 8 March 1917. Subjected to multiple counter-attacks through the day, the battalion held on to the beachhead despite the main force being unable to land more troops. They were not relieved until the next day when the Turkish forces retreated. The 7th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 56th Brigade in the 19th (Western) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion and the 9th (Service) Battalion both landed at Boulogne as part of the 74th Brigade in the 25th Division in September 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 10th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 112th Brigade in the 37th Division in August 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 15th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as pioneer battalion to the 14th (Light) Division in July 1918 also for service on the Western Front. Between the wars Even though The Great War ended with the Armistice, battalions of the Loyal Regiment remained active in the early post-war years. The 2nd Loyals were sent to Ireland for service during the Irish War of Independence. The Loyals were dispatched to serve during the Chanak Crisis. Both battalions of the Loyals served in China during the Warlord Era and the Chinese Civil War, protecting the legation in Peking and the international settlements at Tientsin, Canton, and most importantly Shanghai. The 1st Loyals also saw action in policing the British Mandate of Palestine during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Second World War, 1939‚Äì1945Regular Army battalions= Sherman tanks of the 46th Royal Tank Regiment come ashore with infantry of the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) at Anzio, Italy, 22 January 1944. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment were part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, which also included, in addition to 1st Loyals, the 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment and the 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (6th Gordons from early March 1940). The brigade was attached to the 1st Infantry Division. In September 1939 they were sent to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and remained there alongside the French Army until May 1940. The 1st Loyals would participate in the fighting in France and Belgium in 1940, including acting as part of the rearguard for the Dunkirk evacuation during the Battle of Dunkirk. After spending two years on home defence, the 1st Loyals would eventually would see action again as part of the British First Army, fighting in the North African Campaign, in the Tunisia Campaign in early 1943, and Italian Campaign and at the Battle of Anzio where the 1st Division saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war, and 1st Loyals lost a company during a German counterattack but managed to repel them. In May the battalion fought in the breakout of the Anzio bridgehead, Operation Diadem also fought in the battles around the Gothic Line throughout the summer, now as part of the British Eighth Army. The battalion, along with the rest of the 1st Division, were sent to Palestine in January 1945. During the fighting in the Tunisian campaign, in April 1943, Lieutenant Willward Alexander Sandys- Clarke was posthumously awarded the regiment's only Victoria Cross of the war. Bren gun carriers of the 2nd Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) in training, Malaya, October 1941. Upon the commencement of hostilities in 1939, the 2nd Battalion, Loyal Regiment found themselves stationed in the Far East as part of Singapore Fortress's 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the 2nd Loyals fought in Malaya as part of the delaying action during the Battle of Malaya. Eventually, the 2nd Battalion surrendered along with the rest of the Singapore garrison on 15 February 1942. The survivors spent the rest of the war as prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Army. Following the destruction of the 2nd Loyals with its surrender at Singapore, the battalion was reformed in Britain. The 10th Battalion, a hostilities-only battalion created in 1940, was re-designated as the new 2nd Battalion on 28 May 1942.Ordersofbattle.com =Territorial Army battalions= In addition to the two Regular Army battalions, the Loyal Regiment also had two Territorial Army battalions (the 5th and 6th) at the start of the war. The 4th Battalion had been converted to the 62nd Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers before the war. In 1940, it was transferred to the Royal Artillery. In 1943, it became 150th (Loyals) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery and, in March 1944, joined the 9th Armoured Division until it was disbanded and the regiment later served with the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division from August 1944 until March 1945 when it was sent to North- west Europe to join the British Second Army. The 5th Battalion was trained as a motorcycle battalion in the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. The 5th Battalion later was transferred and converted, in 1941, into a Reconnaissance Corps unit for the 18th (East Anglian) Division and re-designated as the 18th Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps.Ordersofbattle.com The 18th Recce was transferred with the rest of the 18th Division as reinforcements for the Battle of Singapore. They arrived at Singapore late in the campaign without much of their equipment and were used as regular infantrymen until the surrender on 15 February 1942. Like the men of the Regular 2nd Battalion captured in Singapore, the men of 18th Recce spent the rest of the war as prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Army. The 6th Battalion was raised in 1939 as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 5th Battalion and served with its parent unit in the 55th (West Lancashire) Division until being transferred to the 59th (Staffordshire) Division soon after the outbreak of war. The battalion, like its parent unit, was also trained as a motorcycle battalion in the 59th Division. Like the 5th Battalion, the 6th Battalion Loyals were also converted in 1941 from their infantry role. The battalion was transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps and converted and re-designated as 2nd Reconnaissance Regiment and joined the 2nd Infantry Division, a Regular Army formation, on 30 April 1941. With the rest of the division, it was transferred in April 1942 to British India, where it would be engaged against the Imperial Japanese Army, notably in India during the Battle of Kohima in 1944 and then as part of William Slim's, commander of the British Fourteenth Army, offensive to re- capture Burma. =War Service battalions= The 7th Battalion was a wartime infantry unit raised at the regimental headquarters, Fulwood Barracks, Preston, on 4 July 1940. The bulk of the battalion's recruits were men from Merseyside, Cheshire and Lancashire, who had been called up for military service. Along with the 8th and 9th battalions it assembled in camp at Caernarfon where, together with 12th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers, they constituted No 15 Infantry Training Group, later 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a home defence formation.Loyals at Regiments.org8 Loyals War Diary, 1940‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/4446.Joslen, p. 378. Training was hampered by the shortage of rifles and equipment, the tented camp became uninhabitable during winter gales, and the battalions went into billets. The 7th battalion went on anti-invasion duties in Liverpool. In February 1941, the brigade transferred to the Durham and North Riding County Division in North East England, guarding the Scarborough coast, Darlington and Redcar against Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion of England, which never arrived.John Downham, 'The Regiments in World War II' at Lancashire Infantry Museum. On 13 November 1941, the 7th Battalion was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 92nd (Loyals) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery and joined the British 3rd Infantry Division, a Regular Army formation. The regiment landed in Normandy with the rest of 3rd Division on D-Day, 6 June 1944, and performed notable service during Operation Tonga in defence of Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge and later fought in the entire North West Europe Campaign.Farndale, Annex M.Routledge, pp. 310‚Äì9.92 LAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. The 8th Battalion was formed on 4 July 1940 at Ashton-under- Lyne, with the majority of the recruits coming from Liverpool and the cadre of experienced non-commissioned officers and men from the Manchester Regiment's Machine Gun Training Centre at Ladysmith Barracks, Ashton-under-Lyne. It also served in 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), and went into billets in disused mills at Biddulph and Huyton during the winter of 1940‚Äì41. Like the 7th Loyals, the 8th Battalion was also transferred to the Royal Artillery, becoming the 93rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, on 15 November 1941. In January 1942, it joined the 42nd Support Group in 42nd Armoured Division (converted from the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division). When the 42nd Armoured was broken up in October 1943, the regiment served in Home Forces, joining 80th AA Brigade to train for an assault role on D-Day. Like the 92nd LAA Regiment, the 93rd LAA Regiment served with the British Second Army in the North West Europe Campaign from 1944 to 1945.93 LAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. The 9th Battalion was also raised in 1940, serving alongside the 7th and 8th battalions in 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). In 1941, the battalion was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps and converted into the 148th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps. However, they continued to wear their Loyal Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, as did all infantry units converted in such a way.Forty, pp. 50‚Äì1. The regiment joined 33rd Armoured Brigade (previously 33rd Tank Brigade) and landed on the beaches of Normandy on 13 June 1944. The regiment fought throughout the Battle for Caen until it was disbanded, due to an acute shortage of manpower, on 16 August 1944, and replaced in the brigade by the 1st East Riding Yeomanry.Joslen, pp. 183 & 206.148 RAC War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/880. The 50th (Holding) Battalion was raised in June 1940. The battalion's purpose was to temporarily 'hold' men who were medically unfit or homeless, awaiting orders, on courses or returning from abroad. In October, it was redesignated as the 10th Battalion and joined the 210th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) and then the 203rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home).Joslen, pp. 366 & 373. The battalion was again re-designated as the 2nd Battalion on 28 May 1942 after the original 2nd Battalion was lost at Singapore in February. The new 2nd Battalion served mainly in the United Kingdom with the 199th Brigade (later 166th Bde) in 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division.Joslen, p. 363. However, in October 1944, the battalion was sent to Italy to fight in the Italian Campaign with the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, 10th Indian Infantry Division, and saw action in Operation Grapeshot, the final offensive in Italy. Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), 1946‚Äì1970 The Loyal Regiment continued to serve during the sunset of the British Empire. Battalions of the regiment served in the Palestine Mandate. The 1st Battalion served in the Malayan Emergency from 1957 to 1959. British and Commonwealth Units that served in the Malayan Emergency retrieved on 2009-07-31 B Company was dispatched to Aden during the Emergency in 1966. A Company was also dispatched followed by C Company prior to the withdrawal of British troops that year. British units serving in Aden 1955‚Äì67 The Regiment was amalgamated with The Lancashire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Volunteers) to form The Queen's Lancashire Regiment at Connaught Barracks in Dover in March 1970.

The first to happen each year was the celebration of the regiment's defence of Kimberley during the Boer War. Annually, the regiment would celebrate this battle honour on 15 February.P.D. Griffin, Encyclopedia of Modern British Army Regiments, (Phoenix Mill: Sutton Publishing, 2006) p.91. The next anniversary on the calendar commemorated the victory at the Battle of Maida, where the 1st Battalion of the 81st Regiment, won the battle honour carried by the Loyals. Annually, the regiment commemorated the battle with a parade and dinner in the mess.Griffin, p. 92. Annually on 13 September, the Loyals commemorated Quebec Day. This celebrated the 47th Regiment's participation in the capture of Quebec under General Wolfe. Men of the 1st Battalion of the Loyals, successors to the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, were eligible to become members of the Wolfe Society. The anniversary was marked by a trooping of the colours while the regimental band played the 47th Regiment's slow march followed by Quebec. On New Year's Eve, the Sergeants' Mess of the Loyals would hold a ball in celebration of Tarifa Day. The ball commemorated the defense of Tarifa by the 47th Regiment in 1811 against a determined assault by the French army. Nicknames The Loyal Regiment inherited its nicknames from its predecessor formations. The regiment's uniform, which was initially scarlet with white facings and the Lancashire rose on their cap badges earned them the name \\"Cauliflowers\\" because of the similar looks. For their service under Wolfe during the Seven Years' War, as well as his earlier service in the regiment, they were known as \\"Wolfe's Own\\". As they recruited and were affiliated within Lancashire, they were also known as the \\"Lancashire Lads\\".Anon., Regimental Nicknames and Traditions of the British Army (London: Gale & Polen, 1916), p. 85. Possessions Over the years, the Loyals, as well as their predecessors acquired a number of possessions which were prized by the regiment. Important to every regiment of the British Army was its silver. In 1958, in honour of the Queen Elizabeth II, the regiment's officers purchased an equestrian statue which was placed in front of the commanding officer's place setting. Before the junior lieutenant's place setting, there was placed a silver fox statute, acquired by the regiment in 1928. Finally, there was the Subaltern's Cup. This was a silver goblet that was part of the place setting of the senior lieutenant of the regiment and used as part of a drinking ritual when the senior lieutenant was finally promoted to captain.Griffin, p. 93. Perhaps the oldest of the regiment's treasures was a snuff box made from a tortoise shell. After the Battle of Maida, the commander of the 1/81st Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Kempt, had a dinner made from a tortoise found near the battle. He turned the shell of the tortoise into a snuff box and presented it to the officer's mess.

Best known for his role in World War I and the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II.  Early life  Nikolai Vladimirovich Ruzsky was born in the Russian Empire on March 6, 1854, into a noble family. His family was of nobility from the Kaluga Governorate, the Ruzsky family's origin traced back to the mayor of the town of Ruza near Moscow during the late 1700s, Aleksei Mikhailovich Lermontov (the Ruzsky family was of the Ostrozhnikovskaya line of the Lermontov family). His father, Vladimir Dmitriyevich, was an official in the 12th Grade. His father died when Ruzsky was a year old and he was put under auspices by the Moscow Custodian Council.  Early career  In 1870, Ruzsky graduated from the Cadet Corps at first class. In 1872, he graduated from the Konstantinovsky Artillery School at first class. In 1877, he participated in the Russo-Turkish War, and was wounded when taking a fortress in Gorni Dubnik. For courage, he was awarded the Order of St. Anna of the 4th degree with the inscription \\"For bravery\\". In July 1878, he attended a reserve battalion in preparation of attending the Nikolayev Academy of General Staff. Ruzsky graduated in 1881, in the first category. During his training in the academy, his teachers were all future ministers of war of future General Aleksey Kuropatkin, Vladimir Sukhomlinov and Aleksandr Roediger, all under the leadership of the prominent general, Mikhail Dragomirov. In December 1881, he was appointed the assistant to the senior adjutant of the Kazan Military District. In 1884, he married a daughter of a retired officer, Zinovia Aleksandrovna Borezovsky, and they together had three children. From March 1882 to November 1887, Ruzsky became the senior adjutant of the headquarter of the Kiev Military District. From 1882 to 1896, he became chief-of-staff to numerous divisions, including the 11th Cavalry Division, the 32nd Infantry Division and the 151st Infantry Pyatigorsk Regiment. In 1896, he became the district quartermaster of the Kiev Military District headquarter. On April 1904, he was appointed the chief-of-staff of the Vilno Military District. During his service in the military district, he enjoyed great reputation and respects from his fellow officers. Russo- Japanese War In the following years, he participated in Russo-Japanese War, in which he commanded the 2nd Manchurian Army. He participated in the battles at Sandepu and Mukden. In the war, he was noticed by fellow officers as one of the best generals and valuable workers in the army. While retreating from Mukden, General Ruzsky was in the rear of the army and was injured from falling off a horse, but he remained in the army. After the war in 1906, he participated in the development of the \\"Regulations on-field command and control of troops in wartime\\" organisation. From May 1907 on, he was a member in the Supreme Military Criminal Court. He investigated the case of the surrender in Port Arthur. In 1909, he was appointed the commander of the 21st Army Corps, but soon was deducted due to poor health. General Nikolai Ruzsky in the army (the tallest man and the only one in the group that wore glass) In December 1909, General Ruzsky became a member of the Ministry of War, and was involved in the development of charters and manuals, and was one the authors of the Field Regulations of 1912. In February 1912, General Ruzsky was again appointed to the Kiev Military District, this time as the assistant commander of the troops in the district. According to the plans of war with Germany and Austria-Hungary, commander of the troops of the Kiev Military District, General Nikolai Ivanov was to be the appointed the commander-in-chief of the army in the Southwestern Front, and General Ruzsky, the commander of army, would be ordered to form the basis of the Kiev Military District.  World War 1  From mid-July to early September, General Ruzsky was in command of the Third Army. In the beginning, despite receiving information about an Austro- Hungarian offensive in Lublin and Holm, he still preserved the offensive against Lemberg. For the battles against the Austrians, and above all, his participation at Lemberg, he was awarded the Order of St. George both the 4th and the 3rd degree (VP in August 1914). And the for his participation in the Invasion of Galicia, he was again awarded the Order of St. George, this time the 2nd degree (VP in October 1914), becoming one of the top three generals (other being General Nikolai Ivanov and Nikolai Yudenich). General Ruzsky gained the name, the ‚ÄúConqueror of Galicia‚Äù, and he also gained great public reputation back in Russia, even his opposition circles. General Ruzsky in 1914 From early September 1914 to mid-March 1915, General Ruzsky was the commander- in-chief of the entire Northwestern Front. Under his command, the forces of the front fought at the Vistula River and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, but despite huge success of the 1st and 10th Armies, he was ordered to retreat, due to a group of German troops commanded by General Reinhard von Scheffer-Boyadel was able to snuck out from the encircling movement. He and his troops also participated in the disastrous battle at the Masurian Lakes. In the latter, General Ruzsky was the one who caused the catastrophe of the 10th Army. As a military leader, he was accustomed in blaming his subordinates for his failures, and particularly, he successfully removed General Paul von Rennenkampf and Sergei Scheidemann from command, at the Sedlets meeting of the Supreme Headquarters, thereby justifying his order to curtail the offensive of his troops from the frontline. However, the activities of these generals weren't expressed groundlessly by the high military commands of the Supreme Command and the Ministry of War. In mid-March 1915, due to poor health, General Ruzsky left the front and handed over the command to the Army Chief of Staff, General Mikhail Alekseyev. In the same year, General Ruzsky was appointed to the State Council. And in May, he was appointed to the Military Council. Sometimes later, he returned to the highest command thanks to a personal decision by Tsar Nicholas II despite General Ruzsky revealed his shortcomings as a military leader to the tsar. The headquarters staff of the Northwestern Front, with General Nikolai Ruzsky in the center, 1917 In late June, General Ruzsky was appointed the commander of 6th Army. And in mid-August, he was appointed to command the whole Northern Front, but on December 1915, he fell ill while commanding the front and left. Then in early August 1916, he recovered from his illness and returned to the front as commander-in-chief, replacing General Kuropatkin. During his time as the commander-in-chief at the Northern Front, his troops were cautious and avoided decisive actions against large-scale enemies.  Russian Revolutions  One of the most active military conspiracy participants was the President of the Imperial Duma, Mikhail Rodzianko, who played an important role in the abdication of Nicholas II. According to the memoirs of the Minister of the Imperial Court Cont Baron Frederiks, who was present at the abdication of the tsar. General Ruzsky brutally and violently forced the wavering tsar the sign the prepared manifesto on abdication. Ruzsky held the tsar by one hand, with the other hand holding the manifesto, and repeatedly said: Nicholas at this point was embarrassed and dejected. A lawyer named N.P. Karabchevsky left his memories about the words by Prince John Konstantinovich's wife, Helena Petrovna. Which when she was being imprisoned in Yekaterinburg, she was visited by the doctor of the Tsesarevich, Vladimir Derevenko, who told the princess about the recall of Nicholas about General Ruzsky. He said: During a conversation with General S. N. Vilchkovsky, General Ruzsky detailed the tsar's resistance to the pressure exerted on the introduction of the new so-called \\"Responsible Ministry\\" (According to the opposition, this ministry was to be submitted not to the Emperor, but the head of the Cabinet, in turn, responsible to the Duma, that is, the conspirators aspired to introduce a parliamentary system in Russia, which was contrary to the existing legislation of the Empire). He argued heatedly about the need of the immediate imposition of the Responsible Ministry. He informed the tsar that his thoughts were wrong, he told Nicholas that it was necessary to adopt the policy: \\"the sovereign reigns, and the government rules.\\" The tsar argued that this policy was too incomprehensible for him, he said that what was necessary was that the people should be educated, or in other words, should be reborn. He disagreed and then argued with the tsar. And about an hour later, Nicholas finally agreed to the Responsible Ministry. It was not understood that why the fact that Nicholas would just all the sudden, he just abandoned his conviction and agreed with Ruzsky. Analysis of the documents leads to the conclusion that, this decision, was made on behalf of the Sovereign, but not by the Emperor himself. After the Revolution, General Ruzsky advocated in maintaining the discipline of the army, which led him into disagreements with the Minister of War, Alexander Guchkov, and army chief of staff General Alekseyev. He was then relieved from command. After which he went South to Kislovodsk.  Demise  In early September 1918, General Ruzsky was arrested in Essentuki by the Reds, and then the Reds offered the general a commander in the army, he rejected it. He referred to the fact that he rejected the war of ‚ÄúRussians against Russians‚Äù. As a result of Ivan Sorokin‚Äôs death on November 1, he was taken by the Reds to the Pyatigorsk Cemetery as a hostage group composed of about 100 tsarist officers, he was then murdered by Georgi Atarbekov.  Legacy  Shortly before his terror demise, General Ruzsky sought to justify himself before his descendants, sharing his memories after the overthrow of the monarchy and the Bolshevik coup d'√©tat. He understood that such a sudden change in the tsar's opinion in favor of the Responsible Ministry, would, in fact, look suspicious. Therefore, General Ruzsky tried to assure that before the tsar gave his consent, he would remark that there had been \\"some kind of change in the sovereign\\". The tsar \\"manifested something like indifference\\". For General Ruzsky, it was important that memory of his descendants would form the belief that everything happened with the tsar's full consent. Ruzsky didn't want to look like a conspirator, but a loyal subject, acting in harmony with his Sovereign.

He accompanied his songs on five-string banjo, guitar, bodhr√°n, and harmonica.  Early years  Bobby Clancy was born in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland to Robert J. Clancy and Johanna McGrath. He was the twin brother of Joan Clancy. Clancy left home in the late 1940s to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) where he travelled all over Europe, including Greece and Egypt where he learned many folk songs. He later joined his older brothers Paddy Clancy and Tom Clancy in New York City, where they worked as actors. The trio would sometimes sing, informally beginning the group later known as the Clancy Brothers. In 1955 Bobby returned to Ireland to settle down and run his father's insurance business. While his youngest brother Liam Clancy took his place in America and officially formed the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem with Paddy, Tom Clancy and friend Tommy Makem, Bobby forged his own solo career, as well as performing the other half of two duos with sister Peg Clancy and an American folk singer named Sharon Collen. Bobby and sister Peg Clancy (also known as Peg Power) recorded two albums together, Songs from Ireland in 1962 and As We Roved Out in 1964 and toured as a duo, appearing on several Irish television programs in the 1960s, such as As Zosimus Said. The other duo, Bobby Clancy and Sharon Collen, appeared on Irish television's Ballad Session in 1965. According to several newspaper articles on Google News Archives they performed some shows in the United States. As a solo, Bobby brought his show to the small screen with his own TV series on Irish television, When Bobby Clancy Sings. He married Moira Mooney, a school teacher in the mid-1960s. Together they had four children; three daughters, Aoife in 1966, Roisin in 1967, and Aideen in 1979, and one son, Finbarr in 1970. Aoife Clancy and Finbarr Clancy followed in their father's footsteps and now tour as Irish folk Singers. In 2007, son Finbarr became a member of The High Kings. The Clancy Brothers When Tommy Makem left in 1969, Bobby took his place and became a member of the Clancy Brothers for the first time. The four brothers, Paddy, Tom, Bobby and Liam released three studio albums, Clancy Brothers Christmas, Flowers in the Valley and Welcome to Our House. The first two albums were produced under Columbia Records while the latter was released under Audio Fidelity Records. Bobby's initial tenure with the Clancy Brothers was short-lived. According to fans who spoke with the group over the years, but unverified in the media, he and Liam got into an argument which resulted in Bobby quitting the group. Bobby resumed his solo work, releasing a solo album Good Times When Bobby Clancy Sings and appearing live on a compilation album from a 1974 German Folk Festival, both in 1974. Living in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts in the early 1970s, Bobby made a surprise cameo on his brothers' Brockton, Massachusetts TV special in 1974 where he led the brothers and current fourth member Louis Killen on \\"Mountain Tay.\\" In 1976, the Clancy Brothers disbanded for a few months. Liam Clancy and Louis Killen left the group and remaining brothers Paddy and Tom decided to go on a hiatus. In 1977 plans went into motion to regroup and Paddy and Tom asked Bobby to join. The three brothers recruited their nephew, singer-songwriter Robbie O'Connell. The quartet toured part- time, performing three-month-long tours each year in March, August and November only in the United States. They released two albums, both live, one in 1982 and the other in 1988, Clancy Brothers and Robbie O'Connell Live! and Tunes and Tales of Ireland respectively. During the remaining part of the year, Bobby continued running the insurance business in Carrick-on-Suir and continued performing solo in Ireland. Youngest brother Liam Clancy rejoined Bobby, Paddy and Robbie in 1990 when brother Tom was diagnosed and later succumbed to stomach cancer in November 1990. The Clancy Brothers and Robbie O'Connell, now Paddy, Bobby and Liam performed more frequently than they had in the 1970s and 1980s, appearing on numerous TV shows in America and Ireland, notably Live with Regis and Kathie Lee in 1991, 1993 and 1995, Bob Dylan's The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration in 1992, and RT√â's Lifelines in 1994. The quartet released the group's first studio album in over 20 years, Older But No Wiser, in late 1995, an album title coined by Bobby's wife Moira. Soon after the album's release, Liam Clancy and Robbie O'Connell left the group. Bobby and Paddy continued performing with Bobby's son Finbarr Clancy and friend Eddie Dillon from Boston. This new line-up toured until November 1998 when Paddy died from lung cancer. Later years and death Now as a trio, the Clancys and Eddie Dillon recorded two live albums, Clancy Sing-a-Long Songs and Once in a Lifetime: An Evening of Fine Irish Music. Bobby Clancy released an additional two solo albums, The Quiet Land and Make Me a Cup, in 1999 and 2000 on the Ark Albums label, a recording studio and company in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. In 1999 Bobby was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and by 2000 he was unable to perform on his feet. The trio had to do all their concerts sitting down. By March 2002, he was unable to perform and had to quit a scheduled tour. On 6 September 2002, Bobby Clancy died at the age of 75. He left behind a twin sister, siblings Peg and Liam, his wife, four children, and two grandchildren.

(1976). Spill in Portugal: A Report of the Jakob Maersk Incident. Environmental Emergency Branch. Environmental Protection Service. pp. 1-2, pp. 6-8, pp. 31-32. Environment Canada Built in 1966, the tanker was owned by Maerskline Navigation Company, a subsidiary of A.P. Moller, and contracted by Shell Oil Company consisting of a crew of seventeen at the time of the accident. Seven of those seventeen crew members died during the explosion. Jakob Maersk was carrying 88,000 tons of crude oil from Kharg Island in Iran while entering the Port of Leix√µes in the northern part of Portugal to discharge the oil to the Sacor Refinery. Receiving aid from tug boats, the ship grounded on a sand bank, causing a huge explosion and subsequent fire that burned for days. The explosion broke the ship apart, spilling crude oil into the water. Oil spill At about 12:25 P.M. on January 29, 1975, the ship was entering the Port of Leix√µes in Portugal, while entering the Danish tanker hit sandbar and cause the ship to spill massive amounts of oil into the ocean followed by a few explosions inside the engine room. The cause of this infamous disaster was because of human error. 7 of those 17 crew members died in that explosion, the majority of deaths were engineers. During the time of explosions, the ship began to sink causing survivors to jump into the water, the tugboat Monte de Luz assisted by rescuing survivors that were nearby.Canelas, L. D., Calejo Monteiro, J. D. (1977). Studies of an Oil Spillage Due to the Jakob Maersk Accident. Industry- tac.org. Retrieved April 22, 2013 Jakob Maersk oil spill was the second largest spill at the time which occurred in the second largest city in Portugal. Out of the 40,000 to 50,000 tons of oil that were spilled consumed either by the fire or the ocean, 20,000 to 25,000 tons of that oil drifted into the sea and about 15,000 tons came to shore due to the wind direction during the first few days. The explosion caused thick black smoke to rise. The ship burned for 58 continuous hours. There were reports of locals being affected by the fire that was caused but it did not escalate into serious effects or injuries. Containment and cleanup Containment of the oil spill began with the placement of a floating boom at the harbor entrance. A straw barrier was placed around the wreck to briefly contain the spill while boats spread dispersants. The owners of the ship and the Shell company met together to decide how the oil spill was going to be cleaned or treated. The cleanup was the responsibility of the Portuguese Navy, Commandant Casquinno was appointed to clean up the oil spill and came up with a plan. The plan was separated into two actions, the first part of the plan was to clean up as much oil as possible that was in the water and the second part of the plan was to clean the oil that washed ashore. A company called Fina Oil Company was nearby and contributed several drums of Finasol. This oil spill unlike others was very lucky due to the fact that there was an immediate response. There were boats readily available both large and small to use as transportation. Equipment was offered of all types especially heavy equipment that was necessary. Hoses and nozzles were provided by the local fire department. Labor was available from skilled to unskilled which was crucial for this operation. The nearby Oporto airport made it easier to deliver specialized equipment within a near proximity. Communication was easily established in a nearby communications facility that was used as the Command Center. The type of shoreline made it an easy accessible area with fairly easy mobility of machinery and personnel. The fire that was caused was in some ways fortunate because it burned most of the fuel and if it had not been for it there would have been an even bigger mess on the shoreline. BP made a huge contribution to the oil spill by contributing a chemical dispersant via airplane with 140 drums of BP 1100x on January 30, 1975, 150 of dispersant on January 31, 1975, provided a team of 5 to clean up the spill as much as possible. It was approximated that 2,000 barrels of dispersant was used to treat the oil spill. The purpose was to try and eliminate the oil on the coast using the waves as assistance to spread the dispersant. Even though it was a somewhat effective method is merely masked the oil in the sand. Later on machinery was brought in to dig up the contaminated sand and clean it using another method.Center For Tankship Excellence. Jakob Maersk. c4tx.org. Retrieved April 22, 2013 from http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/precis.php5?key=19750129_001 The most affected beach was the shore immediately adjacent to the wreck, where cleanup began with the removal of the upper layer of sand and the application of dispersants. It was bunker C oil a heavily residual oil which made it more difficult. This area was left until late in the cleanup and was extremely difficult to clean because the bunker C oil had been spread and untreated for some time. Dispersant was also added and affected very minimally due to the heavily seated bunker C. The ship's prow became stuck on a set of rocks near the Castelo do Queijo monument, remaining there for about 20 years, eventually becoming a landmark of the city until its removal. Ecological effects Ecological damage appeared to be limited. Only half a dozen oiled birds were discovered during the first week on nearby shores. There was no apparent harmful effect on local fish populations, although a temporary difference in taste was observed. Dead seaweed and molluscs were found, but growth resumed shortly thereafter and populations returned to normal levels. The cost of the catastrophe was estimated at 2.8 million dollars by the international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The Sunsetz, led by Makoto Kubota, and Sandii started as separate artists, and each have a separate discography. However, their collaboration provided a particular body of work that is representative of the period, and which successfully blended Eastern, Western and pop influences. Career=Early days \\\\- born Sandra O'Neale - was born in Japan to an American father of Irish and Spanish ancestry and a Japanese mother. Her father was in the U.S. Navy, and she spent her early life in Japan, but moved to Hawaii in her early teens and began to study hula and Pacific dance. After becoming accomplished as a singer and dancer, Sandii released her first record \\"Perusha Neko\\" under the name Sandi Ai. Returning to Japan in 1975 she was befriended by Kyu Sakamoto, who helped her to get a job as a DJ on NHK TV in Japan. Sandii performed during the interval of the \\"World Popular Song Festival\\" in late 1975, and secured a record deal with Toho. Sandii's debut album, \\"Sandi Ai\\", is a mix of Japanese originals and covers of well-known songs by John Lennon and Olivia Newton-John. The album was not a great success, and Sandii left Toho for Discomate Records. In 1976 Sandii performed at the Yamaha World Popular Song Festival as a non-competitor interval act, and the next year she won the prestigious ‚ÄúGrand Prix Best Vocal Performance‚Äù award with the single Goodbye Morning, her best selling record to date. Sandii met Makoto Kubota in 1976, when he was a guest on her NHK TV show and afterward joined his band Yuyake Gakudan (\\"Sunset Gang\\") as a backup singer. Makoto was an accomplished musician with broad influences, and the collaboration went on to be critically acclaimed, though never quite achieving the popular success expected. The music of The Sunset Gang was very influenced by blues, Southern and West Coast rock, but later they became increasingly interested in Hawaiian and Okinawan music. At this time Sandii also became friends with the future members of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, frequent collaborators with the Sunset Gang; Haruomi Hosono naming her \\"Sandii\\" because of the connection with Hawaii. However, until 1980 Sandii used a variety of names for different session work e.g. \\"Sandra Hohn\\", \\"Sandi A. Hohn\\", even \\"Sandy Ayako\\". On the soundtrack of Lupin The Third Sandii performed the songs \\"I Miss You Babe\\" and \\"Love Squall\\"; the latter was a single release paired with the theme of the TV series by Yuji Ohno In 1978 Sandii sang the end title theme for the Japanese release of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile, which became a top 20 hit in Japan. This gave Sandii and Makoto the opportunity to record a follow-up album. With limited time and budget, the album \\"Mystery Nile\\" consists of disco and pop cover versions including \\"Dancing Queen\\" by ABBA. Sandii and Makoto used fake English names on the record - \\"Sandy O'Neil\\" and \\"Theo Layer\\". Other guest appearances include the albums \\"Dead End\\" and \\"Monkey Magic\\" by Godiego plus \\"Melting Pot\\" by Yamamoto Sho, whose backing band became Ippu-Do (including future Japan member Masami Tsuchiya. In 1979, again using the name \\"Sandy O'Neil\\", Sandii released the disco track \\"Hey! King Kong\\", which failed to become a hit. The same year saw Sandii's first guest appearance with the Yellow Magic Orchestra on their album Solid State Survivor. Right at the end of '79 the Y.M.O. and Sandii began to record her debut for Alfa Records, \\"Eating Pleasure\\", featuring lyrics by Yellow Magic Orchestra lyricist, Chris Mosdell, who, as he had done for YMO's Solid State Survivor also wrote the bulk of the lyrics for \\"Eating Pleasure\\". At this point Makoto also wound up the Sunset Gang and Sandii & The Sunsetz were born. The two groups had the same members, but Sandii became lead vocalist. The collaboration with Mosdell would go on to produce some of the band's biggest hits over the next four years. Sandii and Makoto are on record as saying they were influenced by the sound and success of Blondie and later became friends with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein.Bibliography 1980s: The Sunsetz Their first show as Sandii & The Sunsetz was opening for Yellow Magic Orchestra at Budokan in December 1980. In 1981 their next album Heat Scale, again featuring lyrics by Chris Mosdell, was released in 17 countries - most international releases adding tunes from \\"Eating Pleasure\\". From the release of \\"Heat Scale\\" until the next album release \\"Immigrants\\" (with a title song penned once more by lyricist Chris Mosdell) The Sunsetz spent a lot of time in the UK, recording with David Sylvian and Fun Boy Three producer Dave Jordan. Sounds, NME and Melody Maker gave The Sunsetz extensive coverage which gave the group a lot of credibility in Japan, leading to increased record sales. Their live act gained many fans in the international music industry following their support slot on the final Japan world tour. The Sunsetz went on to tour and play festivals with Eurythmics, Inxs, Blondie and David Bowie. Their extensive touring and TV appearances in Australia in 1983 allowed them to achieve the #11 charting hit single \\"Sticky Music\\" (lyrics by Chris Mosdell).David Kent (1993). Australian Chart Book 1970 - 1992. Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W. Sandii & the Sunsetz also wrote songs for pop idol Akina Nakamori, including her hit \\"Babylon\\". Sadly, the group had problems with international distribution and promotion and were unable to replicate that success worldwide, but had an avid cult following. Steve Cropper saw Sunsetz guitarist Keni Inoue play in his distinctive plucking style (as heard on \\"Open Sesame\\") and asked to be taught the technique. In 1985 Sandii & The Sunsetz left Alfa Records for Toshiba-EMI, whose greater financial muscle gave the group a better budget to work with. Following a collaboration with Stephen Duffy (\\"Something Special\\") the group released the rock influenced \\"La La La La Love\\", released as \\"Banzai Baby\\" outside Japan. Although a strong album musically the group were disappointed that it was not promoted internationally, despite following the guidance of the record company, and opted to follow their own creative vision for subsequent releases. This led them to reggae, dancehall and other Jamaican styles which heavily influenced the final Sunsetz albums \\"Rhythm Chemistry\\" and \\"One Love\\". 1990-present: Latter days In 1990, the group had another re-invention, just using the name Sandii, although they would carry on using \\"& The Sunsetz\\" for live appearances well into the 1990s. Sandii and Makoto decided to concentrate on the Asian market and subsequent releases sold in greater numbers, helped by Sandii recording key songs in up to four languages. In 1996 Sandii recorded the first of her \\"Hawaii\\" albums and became increasingly involved in Hula culture. Sandii now runs two Hula schools, in Harajuku, Tokyo and Yokohama and has a TV series on NHK, contributing to the popularity of Hula dance in Japan and allowing Sandii to release roughly two albums a year of Hawaiian and other Pacific style music. In late 2005 Sandii achieved the rank of Kumu Hula and celebrated with an event at a shrine in Ise, with old friend Haruomi Hosono providing the music. Makoto Kubota is still a major music producer in Japan, always exploring new directions in world music.

Early life Webley was born in Clapham, London. His aunt Vera was the fan club secretary for Frankie Laine, who was Webley's godfather on 1 June 1957. His first introduction to music was when Donald Swann attended his primary school to play to all the pupils after the school's music teacher died. Webley later said \\"From the first moment he lifted the piano lid, I knew the direction my life was going to take.\\" Webley left school at the age of 14 to go on the road with a showband. He became friends with and regularly accompanied Herbie Flowers in his late teens after writing to the bassist for advice and was a session bass player until the age of 30. Music career He became a musical director for EMI at 30 and produced dozens of chart records. In 1989, Webley became bandleader on Jameson Tonight with Derek Jameson and Shane Ritchie. He composed or arranged the theme music for the television programmes Have I Got News For You, The Office, Room 101, and Graham Norton as well as play-out music for One Foot in the Grave (for which he claimed he was paid more than the more famous Have I Got News For You theme). Webley also composed numerous other themes for the National Theatre, Arts Theatre, ballet, and radio including Ian McMillan's East Coast Girls, Emma Clarke's Share and Share Alike, and Neil Mossey's Stockport So Good They Named It Once. Broadcasting career Webley began presenting the Saturday late show on GLR in 1994 and continued until 1996 when he suffered a heart attack whilst on the air. He successfully finished the show but was forced to take the next three years off to fully recover. Upon his return in 1999 Webley presented the BBC Two educational series Music File, which won the Prix La Basle award for educational excellence. In 2002 he won the Sony Radio Academy Gold Award for Best Music Presenter whilst on BBC Three Counties, where he launched \\"Cabbie Chat ‚Äì The Rank Opinion\\", which ran every morning on his Milton Keynes Breakfast programme. The idea was to ask the cab drivers of Milton Keynes their opinions on the day's news. It lasted until Webley offended some of the drivers over a news item about taxi drivers. He appeared as an expert musicologist on various TV and radio programmes, including The Big Breakfast, Esther, Kilroy, 5Live breakfast with Nicky Campbell, Radio 4's Today, John Peel's Home Truths, Moral Notes, and Landmark Places with Laurie Taylor. He wrote, presented and/or produced documentaries for Radio 4, including Playing Second Fiddle and Sense of Place. He produced over three dozen parodies, songs and live performances for the Radio 1 Roadshow with Chris Moyles, who described him in his book The Gospel According To Chris Moyles as a genius. He was also mentioned in Angie Bowie's biography Backstage Passes (Life on the Wildside with David Bowie) and in Bruce Thomas: The Big Wheel.  BBC London 94.9 (2006‚Äì2011)  Webley joined BBC London 94.9 in August 2006. He hosted his radio show on BBC London 94.9 for four years. He first presented the 2 am until 6 am slot, Monday to Friday until 2 January 2009. From 5 January 2009 until January 2010 he presented the same type of madcap/serious phone-in show at the earlier time of 10 pm until 2 am, Monday to Friday. In January 2010, he returned to overnight shows on Tuesdays to Saturdays. On his radio show, the show's topics were usually concerned with issues to do with London and the day's news stories. He was known to be witty, enthusiastic about music and to have a fantastic general knowledge. Occasionally he and a listener used to have a little sing-along and have a banter. Webley was known to get a regular pop quiz from some of his callers on a wide range of issues, mainly to do with music. The show attracted a substantial number of listeners outside of the United Kingdom. He was also a regular contributor on Network BBC radio programmes including the Today Programme, Simon Mayo, Paul Gambaccini, and 5Live Breakfast with Nicky Campbell. He presented the BBC London 94.9 overnight show from August 2006, at the time of his death occupying the 2 am until 6 am slot Monday to Saturday. One of the features of the show was the 'moan in', where listeners were given the opportunity to vent their frustrations about various issues. Topics of discussion were generally those dealt with by tabloid newspapers. The format was very much akin to American talk radio.  Live band  His band The G Spot played their first gig on 28 Aug 2010 for Natalie Cassidy at the National Theatre, South Bank, London. The performance was filmed for a reality show to be shown later that year on E4.  Personal life  George Webley was married to Sheila and had two sons Harry, and Twig, two daughters Natalie Jayne and Clare and three grandchildren. At the time of his death Webley was in a relationship with fellow broadcaster JoAnne Good.  Death  Webley died on 7 May 2011, at the age of 53 after collapsing at his family home in Milton Keynes from a heart attack. An inquest at Milton Keynes Coroner's Court resulted in a verdict of death by misadventure after the coroner heard that Webley, who had a history of heart disease, had taken the Class B drug mephedrone prior to the heart attack.

It connects the community of Manette, Washington to downtown Bremerton. Although it is not part of a numbered state highway, it is one of four bridges specifically designated by state law to be maintained by the Washington Department of Transportation.RCW 47.17.960: Local bridges ‚Äî Department responsibility, accessed March 2008 The bridge was above the water, and had a horizontal clearance of between the piers. Ferry crossing Before the bridge was opened in 1930 the trip was made by ferry. Between 1916 and 1930, the Mosquito Fleet ferry Pioneer serviced the crossing between Bremerton and Manette for most of the time. Sometimes the Urania, a passenger-only ferry, filled in. Missing the last ferry meant a long trip around Dyes Inlet through Chico, Silverdale and Tracyton on mostly unimproved roads. Bridge history The bridge was built as the Bremerton-Manette Bridge, a toll bridge constructed by the East Bremerton Improvement Club to assist families in commuting from the eastside of Bremerton, Washington to the westside. Locals went door to door selling stock, raising approximately $200,000 for the bridge. Construction on the bridge began October 1929, by the Union Bridge Company of Portland, Oregon. The bridge was long, high, and 2 lanes. The bridge opened on June 21, 1930, amid much celebration. Among those present was Jane Garrison, the 106-year-old granddaughter of Chief Seattle. Originally the bridge was a toll bridge, with tolls of $.25 per car, and $.05 per pedestrian. The Washington Toll Bridge Authority purchased the bridge in 1937. The tolls generated on the bridge enabled the Washington Toll Bridge Authority to recover the purchase price within a year and a half. George Baker was a toll collector on the bridge from the day the bridge opened until the toll ended. He was said to always have an extra nickel for the young person who lost his toll money. The toll was lifted January 28, 1939. The last person to pay a toll on the bridge was J.C Bartholet, at 3:59 pm that day. The bridge remained toll-free until the nearby Warren Avenue Bridge opened as a toll bridge. Since traffic would use the toll-free Manette Bridge instead, tolls were reinstated from November 25, 1958 to October 24, 1972. In 1949, the timber approaches were replaced with concrete and steel components. The entire timber roadway deck was replaced around the same time. The main span thru truss and deck trusses are from the original 1930's bridge. The Manette Bridge, which was first built in 1930, was listed as structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. In the Spring of 2010, a construction began on a replacement bridge. The new Manette Bridge opened Nov. 10, 2011.Manette Bridge deemed Functionally Obsolete & to be replaced starting 2010.

There is no connection between this Society and the Cambridge Foresters‚Äô Benefit Building Society which was dissolved in 1960 or the Cambridge Peers Economic Building Society which was dissolved in 1972.  History  Having been established in 1850, the Society was based at 6 Post Office Terrace in Cambridge from 1884 until 1967 when it moved to new offices at 32 St. Andrews Street. Ten years after the move the first sub-branch opened in Mill Road. In 1979 the Society's assets reached ¬£50 million and in the following years from 1980 to 1984 another four branches opened. By 1984 assets had reached ¬£100 million. From 1985 to 1991 another six sub-branches opened their doors, while more savings products were launched. By 1991 assets had reached ¬£250 million. The rest of the 1990s saw agency offices becoming full service branches, another five full branch openings, an increased range of products on offer and a move to the present Head Office accommodation. By 2000 assets had reached ¬£500 million and this figure has continued to rise. 2016 saw a number of changes to its branch network. In 2017 The Cambridge announced a ¬£15m investment partnership with The Cambridgeshire County Council Pension Fund through the issuance of Core Capital Deferred Shares ‚Äì only the second building society to do so after Nationwide. In 2017 The Cambridge launched their app to support customers manage their Savings and Mortgage on the go In 2018 The Cambridge announced a new programme 'Making The Difference' to address the challenges faced by First Time Buyers when getting on the property ladder, and following on from this during 2019 the programme was added to, with include 'Rent to Home' In March 2020 The Cambridge expanded its lending area, and now lends across England and Wales  Products and Services  The Cambridge Building Society offers a range of fixed and variable rate mortgages, on properties located across England and Wales. Other products and services available through The Cambridge Building Society include savings, (business and council savings), home insurance and travel money. The products and services from The Cambridge can be managed through their branches, their telephone contact centre and online through their website and their app.  Financial performance  In 2019 The Cambridge Building Society delivered gross lending of ¬£295m and mortgage book growth of 8%. Assets as at 31 December totalled ¬£1.586 billion and profit after tax reached ¬£3.6 million. General reserves were stable at ¬£87.3 million, demonstrating the underlying strength of the Society. In 2018 The Cambridge delivered pre-tax profit of ¬£3.2 million and in 2017 ¬£3.8m.  Branch changes  The Cambridge announced plans for a three year investment programme in 2016 and since then has transformed two branches into vibrant and contemporary stores that combine digital technology with face to face expertise. As part of these plans the Society announced that five of its branches (18 operational at the time) would be closing in June of that year. The villages of Burwell, Soham and Milton saw closures and, in Cambridge, the branches in Mill Road and Chesterton Road were also closed. Five members of staff were deployed elsewhere within the Society. This leaves 12 branches all within a 20 mile radius of Cambridge. 2018 saw a new store open in Central Cambridge 2019 (summer) saw The Cambridge refurbish their Great Shelford branch 2019 (winter) saw The Cambridge refurbish their Ely branch References Category:Building societies of England Category:Banks established in 1850 Category:Companies based in Cambridge ","title":"The Cambridge Building Society"},{"id":"10414029","text":"Obinze is a community in southeastern Nigeria, located near the city of Owerri.

It is a companion to NGC 4654, and the two appear to have interacted roughly 500 million years ago. NGC 4639 is a member of the Virgo Cluster. The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(rs)bc, indicating a spiral galaxy with a weak bar (SAB), an incomplete ring around the bar (rs), and moderate to loosely-wound spiral arms (bc). NGC 4639 has a mildly active galactic nucleus of the Seyfert type 1; one of the weakest known. The compact central source has been detected by its X-ray emission, and is variable on timescales of months to years. There is a supermassive black hole at the core with an estimated mass of . The classical Type Ia Supernova SN 1990N was discovered in this galaxy on June 22, 1990, two weeks before reaching peak brightness. It was positioned east and south of the galaxy core.

Measurement and knowledge of atmospheric water vapor, or \\"moisture\\", is crucial in the prediction of all weather elements, especially clouds, fog, temperature, humidity thermal comfort indices and precipitation. Regions of moisture advection are often co-located with regions of warm advection. Definition Using the classical definition of advection, moisture advection is defined as: :Adv(\\\\rho_m)=-\\\\mathbf{V}\\\\cdot abla \\\\rho_m \\\\\\\\! in which V is the horizontal wind vector, and \\\\rho_m is the density of water vapor. However, water vapor content is usually measured in terms of mixing ratio (mass fraction) in reanalyses or dew point (temperature to partial vapor pressure saturation, i.e. relative humidity to 100%) in operational forecasting. The advection of dew point itself can be thought as moisture advection: :Adv(T_d)=-\\\\mathbf{V}\\\\cdot abla T_d \\\\\\\\! Moisture flux In terms of mixing ratio, horizontal transport/advection can be represented in terms of moisture flux: :\\\\mathbf{f}=q\\\\mathbf{V}\\\\\\\\! in which q is the mixing ratio. The value can be integrated throughout the atmosphere to total transport of moisture through the vertical: :\\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\\\\\! \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\,dz \\\\,=-\\\\int_P^0 \\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{f}}{g}\\\\,dp \\\\, where \\\\rho is the density of air, and P is pressure at the ground surface. For the far right definition, we have used Hydrostatic equilibrium approximation.

It is the 16th largest building society in the UK, based on total assets of ¬£1,091.4m as at 31 December 2019.Leek United The Society has 12 branches and two agencies across Cheshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire. It is a member of the Building Societies Association. History The Society was established as the Leek United Permanent Benefit Building Society on 1 January 1863, under the motto ‚ÄòFirm and Lasting (as the pyramids)‚Äô. The burgeoning building society movement of the mid-19th century saw hundreds of local mutual savings and loan organisations opening up across the country, and at the time of Leek United's incorporation, there were almost 3,000 building societies in existence. Today, \\"the friendlier face of finance\\" remains one of the country's oldest surviving and largest independent mutuals. By 1883, the Society had total assets of ¬£90,000, reserves of ¬£5,000 and a membership of 1,328. It changed its name to Leek United & Midlands Building Society in 1919, and then to Leek United Building Society in 1990. Unlike many of the UK's other building societies, Leek United has never grown through acquisition or merger. In 1999, Leek United was the target of a hostile takeover bid by Murray Financial Corporation, an Edinburgh-based financial group, which tabled a ¬£30.5 million bid for the Society. It was a time when carpetbagging was rife, and the UK's remaining building societies were forced to fight for survival as opportunists sought to strip them of their mutual status and convert them into plc banks. Although Leek United's Board rejected Murray Financial's offer, Murray gained the approval of 100 of the Society's members to call a special general meeting to consider the bid. It was estimated that each of Leek United's 60,000 members could gain an ¬£800 windfall from the sale of the Society. The bid failed, however, when the Society's members rejected the offer by an almost three to one ratio. Leek United remains committed to the principles of mutuality, serving the interests and needs of its members, rather than paying dividends to external shareholders. In 2013 Leek United celebrated its 150th anniversary ‚Äì and in 2017 reached another milestone, when for the first time in its history the Society's assets reached over ¬£1bn.Building Societies Association Community Leek United is actively engaged with local communities across the four counties ‚Äì Cheshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire ‚Äì it serves, and has raised and donated money to many charitable causes and organisations, including: the County Air Ambulance Trust, the Douglas Macmillan Hospice, East Cheshire Hospice, Donna Louise Children's Hospice, Bloodwise, Macmillan Cancer Support, Treetops Hospice, Severn Hospice and The Rossendale Trust. One of its biggest beneficiaries is the County Air Ambulance Trust, which alone has received ¬£227,000 from the Society via its County Air Ambulance Trust Affinity Account since the account was introduced in 2008. Leek United also has strong and longstanding links with the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and the Donna Louise Children's Hospice in Stoke-on-Trent. Both hospices receive donations for every vote cast and, until 2018, for each member questionnaire returned at the Society's Annual General Meeting. (Source: Annual Notice of Annual General Meeting) The Society is also currently main sponsor of the annual Leek & District Show in its Staffordshire Moorlands heartland.

Once in three years, the people of Obazu Mbeiri in Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State gather to celebrate, dressed up as though it were Christmas. The traditional ruler and the elderly come out in their colourful reach-down attires topped off with hats. The women are no less gaily clad. For it is the Fish Day.The Emume Azu is a unique event among the Obazu. The people, at home and in the Diaspora, attend in their numbers, with quite a sizeable number of tourists joining them, some from far beyond the borders. Why will a land-locked community without any river or pond choose to honour an aquatic animal? The answer is not farfetched. The community derived its name Obazu or calabash of fish, from the huge fish trade that flourished there during the pre-colonial era. Obazu was a fish port and the founders were great fish merchants, making great wealth from the trade. Such was prominence the business brought that they dedicated a particular day to fish. That day is one to be merry, eat giant fish and savour not just its nourishment but also the fame that has come with it. The festival is a seven-day event that is characterized by visitations, kindred meetings, cultural dances and masquerade display. During the period, issues bordering on the security, welfare and development of the community are discussed and possible solutions proffered. On the day of the festival climaxes, people from the seven families that make up the Obazu Mbieri assemble at the village square various delicacies made of fish are served. Different sizes and species of fish are prepared and one's affluence and generosity is measured by the size of fish he presents. The fish is served in diverse forms; some are simply smoked, while others are grilled, fried or cooked and there is always enough of it that the visitors will eat to their satisfaction and still have enough to take home  References  .The unique fish festival in mbieri https://thenationonlineng.net/a-unique-fish-feast-in-imo *Place name and co- ordinates verified using GEOnet Names Server, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

It is bounded on the north by Eziama Obiato and Afara communities; on the south and southwest by Ogbaku and Ejemekwuru communities; and on the south and southeast by Ifakala and Afara communities. It is served by the great east-west road, the Port-Harcourt-Lagos Highway. Umunoha is about thirteen kilometers from Owerri, the Imo State capital. It is a small, compact but thickly populated community with a projected 1997 population of twenty- five thousand people. Culture and people Umunoha is known for certain traditions and culture, such as Igwekala shrine, Orie-Amaigwe market, Mmanwu masquerade, and traditional rulership by the Egbuchulam Chimezie royal family. Umunoha's famous Igwekala shrine still in exists, a jungle that covers over 100 acres of land near the center of Umunoha. Igwekala is famous for its healing powers, and people come from all over the continent to receive healing and recover their health. This is also an economic source for some of the and the native doctors who tend the shrine. They are known as \\"Mbranigwe\\", meaning members of the Igwekala cult. Igwekala was combed by the British during Colonial times, and was combed again by the Nigerian Army during the Nigerian Civil war (Biafran Genocide, 1966 - 1970). However, Igwekala shrine still exists. Umunoha has a notable market known as Orie-Amaigwe. This market meets every eight days from 5am to 8pm, and is well attended by buyers from neighboring towns and all over Imo State, and Nigeria at large. The market sells a vast variety of products. Umunoha also has a famous cultural masquerade known as Mmanwu. Every male child of Umunoha born in Nigeria is required by tradition to be initiated into this masquerade cult at puberty, and become an Otigba as they are called. The female children also join the culture, but their membership known as Erere is not as serious as the male children. A male child of Umunoha initiation into Mmanwu signifies and authenticates the child as an Okechi son, or \\"Diala Okechi\\" as they hail and greet each other, meaning real son of Umunoha. History The town's creation myth usually, but not always, claims it was founded by a common ancestor, who begat several children to whom he allocated areas on which to settle. These areas eventually became villages, according to the tradition of origin of Umunoha, an autonomous community in Mbaitoli Local Government Area (LGA) in Imo State. According tradition, a sort of warlord called Nnoha Okechi with vague Aro ancestry, but certainly a peripatetic individual, migrated from Ozuzu in the present Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State, and settled in Umunoha, having decisively defeated the original Isu settlers, who resisted him fiercely. He dispersed the Isu, seized their land, and distributed it among his children according to seniority as follows: Duru, his first son, became the progenitor of the present Umuduru village; Okparaoma, Duru's younger brother from the same mother and the third child, the progenitor of the present Umuokparaoma village. Okparafor, the fourth child and third son from a different mother, the progenitor of the present Umuokparafor village; Durundom, Duru's only sister and Nnoha's second child whom he refused to give out in marriage, remained at home and begat the present Umudurundom village; and Mbara, brother of Okparafor and Nnoha's fifth and last child, begat the present Umumbara village. Later the area so divided and effectively occupied was renamed Umunoha. Here is a case where consangineal relationship is a sine qua non for citizenship. From the beginning of the history of Umunoha to present, the town has been ruled by the royal family of Egbuchulam Chimezie of Okwaraihekuna Obakpu, dating as far back as Colonial time(1800s) when they ruled the Igwebuike Kingdom (A collection of communities in Mbaitoli before the creation of local governments). The third-generation ruler and leader of the royal family, HRH, Late Christopher Nlemchukwu Egbuchulam, Eze Nnoha II of Umunoha who was buried in November 2018, was once the Surveyor-General of Imo State. He left that post to become King, succeeding his father. The present heir to the throne, his eldest son Engineer Chukwuma prepared with the rest of the royal family for his coronation in November 2019 to become the fourth generation traditional ruler. Tradition and law of the land demand mourning for the dead king for one year.

On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North Western University making it the first recognized university in Illinois. While the original founders were devout Methodists and affiliated the university with Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non- sectarian admissions. John Evans purchased of land along Lake Michigan in 1853 and Philo Judson began developing the plans for what would become the city of Evanston. The first building, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855. As a private university that had to raise funds for construction, Northwestern sold $100 \\"perpetual scholarships\\" that entitled the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition. Northwestern admitted its first female students in 1869. Northwestern first fielded an intercollegiate football team in 1882, and later became a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. Northwestern became affiliated with professional schools of law, medicine, and dentistry throughout the Chicago area in the 1870s and 1880s. Enrollments grew through the 1890s, and under Henry Wade Rogers these new programs were integrated into a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, and emphasizing teaching along with research. The Association of American Universities invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917. Under Walter Dill Scott's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in downtown Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers to house the professional schools, the establishment of the Kellogg School of Management, as well as opening new buildings on the Evanston campus like Dyche Stadium and Deering Library. A proposal to merge Northwestern with the University of Chicago was considered in 1933, but rejected by Northwestern. Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II. Franklyn B. Snyder lead the university from 1939 to 1949, and during the war nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure, from 1949 to 1970, was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus with the construction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. Tensions between the Evanston community and the university were strained throughout much of the post-war era given episodes of disruptive student activism, Northwestern's exemption from property tax obligations, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus under the original charter although the latter ban was lifted in 1972. As government support of universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President Arnold R. Weber oversaw the stabilization of university finances and revitalization of the campuses. As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Henry S. Bienen's tenure oversaw the increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, as well as renewed athletic competitiveness. Foundation $100 Perpetual Scholarships granted free tuition to the purchaser and his inheritors. In 1850, Chicago was only a 17-year-old city of 28,000 inhabitants that was increasingly becoming the center of trade for both steamships and railroads. The political and cultural environment of the mid-nineteenth century resulted in individual states granting charters to hundreds of small colleges rather than a few centralized national institutions as was typical in European countries. These colleges were highly sectarian and were motivated by the desire to both increase the quality of ministerial training as well as to discourage its young people from attending schools controlled by rival denominations. On May 31, 1850, John Evans, Grant Goodrich, Henry W. Clark, Andrew Brown, Orrington Lunt, Jabez Botsford, Richard Haney, Richard H. Blanchard, and Zodoc Hall met in a law office above a hardware store at 69 West Lake Street in Chicago and resolved that \\"the interests of sanctified learning require the immediate establishment of a university in the Northwest under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\\" While each of the founders had diverse educational, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds, they were all devout Methodists as well as successful and established businessmen, ministers, and lawyers within Chicago. Despite their evangelism, the founders were committed to the establishment of a non-sectarian institution reflecting both the worldly educational philosophy of the Methodist movement and the political realities of the Illinois state legislature adverse to chartering church-affiliated colleges. Goodrich was adept in drafting the charter and lobbying legislators who shared his abolitionist views and the charter was passed during the first session of the General Assembly and signed by Governor Augustus French on January 28, 1851. Constituted as the \\"Trustees of the North Western University,\\" the new institution was the first university in Illinois and consisted of the founders as well as representatives from the neighboring Methodist conferences. Evans and Lunt initially each donated $5,000 to endow the university which permitted them to purchase 16 lots on the northeast corner of Jackson Boulevard and LaSalle Street for $8,000 as a potential site for the campus. Fountain Square, Evanston, Illinois in 1876. In 1853, the trustees elected Clark T. Hinman as the first president of the university and committed to raising $200,000. Hinman insisted that a university, rather than a preparatory school, be constructed first and that it should be built outside of Chicago. Following Hinman's recommendation, Lunt began to survey for land that was both north of the city and abutting railways for a new university in the areas of Jefferson Park and Ridgeville. Unable to find available land on the north shore up to Lake Forest, the committee was ready to purchase farmland to the west of the city when Orrington Lunt insisted on one final visit to the present location. A parcel of dry, wooded bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan belonging to a Dr. John Foster (unrelated to Randolph S. Foster) was purchased by Evans for $25,000 in August 1853 as a site for the new campus. In 1855, the university charter was amended to declare that university property \\"shall be forever free from taxation for any kind and all purposes.\\" The trustees aggressively used the property-tax-exempt status to purchase more of the surrounding farms and Northwestern land holdings grew as large as . In 1854, Philo Judson, Northwestern's business manager charged with surveying and plotting this real estate nicknamed the land \\"Evanston\\" in honor of founder John Evans. In 1857, the Illinois legislature changed the name of the village from Ridgeville to Evanston and it became an incorporated city in 1863. The university undertook a major development effort to drain the swamps, clear and grade the land, and donated or sold land to permit the construction of streets, parks, schools, waterworks, and churches. Between 1860 and 1870, Evanston's population had grown from 831 to 3,062. Hinman was also a fervent supporter of the nascent university and raised over $63,000 from the sale of the perpetual scholarships. These scholarships, purchased in four installments of $25, entitled the purchaser and his male heirs (after the university became coeducational, female heirs were also recognized) to free tuition in perpetuity and were sold until 1867. The university also sold less-expensive limited term \\"transferable\\" scholarships guaranteeing a certain number of years of free tuition. While Northwestern still recognizes the scholarship, only one family member per generation is entitled to the scholarship and it must be specifically bequeathed to a descendant. Hinman's untimely death in October 1854 resulted in the ad interim appointment of Professor Henry S. Noyes as president until the 1856 election of Daniel Bonbright, a Professor of Latin, and 1857 election of Randolph S. Foster, a Professor of Theology. Noyes would also succeed Foster, and again serve as president between 1860 and 1869. Early years (1855‚Äì1905) University Hall as it appeared in 1877. Northwestern's first building, Old College, was designed by John M. Van Osdel and opened for classes on November 5, 1855. Despite the vacancy in the presidency and only possessing two faculty members, mathematics Professor Henry S. Noyes and Greek Professor William D. Godman, the first class enrolled 10 men in the College of Literature, Arts, and Sciences. Tuition for the first year was $45 annually and living expenses were $2.50 to $3 weekly. The progressive Methodist trustees also petitioned the Legislature to amend their charter so as to prohibit the sale of liquor within of campus under pain of a $25 fine. Among other early faculty members was Professor of Latin Daniel Bonbright who would remain an active teacher for 58 years. Four students received bachelor's degrees at the first commencement in 1859. In the antebellum period, campus literary societies had sponsored debates on secession and slavery although the predominantly Methodist administration, faculty, and student body was staunchly abolitionist. Between 1861 and 1865, classes were curtailed by the Civil War; between 59 and 77 students and staff fought in the Union armies, 2 fought for the Confederacy, and seven ultimately died in the war. Despite the hostilities, Northwestern offered its first masters program (philosophy) beginning in 1863. Sara Rebecca Roland (Class of 1874) was the first woman to graduate from Northwestern. In 1869, the trustees voted to admit women to the university \\"under the same terms and conditions as young men\\" and Evanston resident, Rebecca Hoag, became the first female student to enroll. In 1873, the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern, increasing the enrollments of female undergraduates. Although, Sarah Rebecca Roland, class of 1874, was the first woman to graduate from Northwestern, Ada Kepley received a law degree in 1870 from the School of Law's predecessor, the Union College of Law. The university also established an alumni association in 1881. The Evanston campus experienced dramatic growth during this era. University Hall, designed by Gurdon P. Randall, opened in 1869 both to replace the temporary Old College and to inaugurate President Erastus O. Haven. Memorial Hall opened at the Garrett Seminary in 1884, Dearborn Observatory opened in 1887, and Lunt Library opened in 1894. Despite the growth of the Evanston campus, the trustees sought to establish professional and academic schools within Chicago. In 1870, the Chicago Medical College, located in the south side of Chicago, merged with a School of Medicine founded in 1859. An 1873 agreement merged the Union College of Law and the Old University of Chicago's Department of Law into a School of Law that opened in 1876. A College of Dental and Oral Surgery established was also established in 1886, but closed in 2001. A School of Pharmacy was established in 1886, but folded in 1916. The Conservatory of Music, founded in 1891, became a permanent department in 1895. A \\"Settlement Association\\" was formed in 1892 to do social work in Chicago. By 1890, Northwestern became the first Midwestern university admitted to Phi Beta Kappa and the first Ph.D.s were awarded (in chemistry and philosophy) in 1896. Henry Wade Rogers served as President between 1890 and 1900, and was an ardent supporter of student athletics. By 1900, Northwestern had the third-highest student enrollment of any university in the nation. The Class of 1902 presented a drinking fountain, but what would later become The Rock, to the university as a senior gift. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited campus. Symbols The modern seal. Northwestern's seal, motto, and colors also emerged in this era. The first seal, adopted in June 1856, featured an open book radiating light circumscribed by \\"Northwestern University,\\" much like the modern seal. In June 1890, the trustees adopted the Latin motto \\"Quaecumque Sunt Vera\\" from Philippians 4:8 meaning \\"Whatsoever things are true.\\" The book on the seal was also altered to include the Greek text \\"œå ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±ŒØ Œ¨ŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ\\" (‚Äúho logos pleres charitos kai aletheias‚Äù) from John 1:14 meaning ‚ÄúThe Word‚Ä¶full of grace and truth.‚Äù The university initially adopted black and gold as its official school colors in response to the growing popularity of intercollegiate athletics and the need to differentiate teams, but when it was discovered that several other schools had the same colors, these colors were quickly dropped in favor of royal purple and gold in 1879. In 1892, the official color became only purple in response to prestigious Eastern universities adopting single-color schemes as well. Student activities In September 1860, a Milwaukee-bound steamship, the Lady Elgin, sank off the coast of the campus in stormy weather after colliding with a schooner. Despite being the second-deadliest accident on the Great Lakes, Edward Spencer '62 and other students from the Garrett Bible Institute were credited with rescuing dozens of passengers. Following a public outcry over life-saving facilities and transportation safety, in 1871, the federal government granted the university a lifeboat and later, in 1876, constructed a life-saving station, both of which were manned and operated by students, near the Grosse Point reef and lighthouse. By the time the Coast Guard assumed control of the station in 1916, it had remained the nation's only student-manned life-saving station; Northwestern students were credited with saving more than 400 people. The Lifesaving Crew at their stations. Northwestern was also home to several literary societies predating fraternal societies. The Adelphic, Hinman, and Ossoi societies published periodicals of essays, poems, and news items. These early periodicals were named The Evanstonian, The Academian, Tripod (1871‚Äì1880), and Vidette. In 1881, the Northwestern was published biweekly and ultimately evolved into the modern The Daily Northwestern newspaper. The Northwestern University Press Company published the Northwestern out of the Gymnasium building until the Press moved off-campus in 1888. By 1900, the student newspapers were published out of the basement of Old College, before they were moved to the attic of Memorial Hall in the 1920s. After World War II, the offices of the student newspaper moved frequently until Norris Hall was completed in 1972. Athletics A Football Association was founded at Northwestern in October 1879, and the university played its first intercollegiate football game against Lake Forest College in 1882. The earliest games were played on the meadow where Deering Library now stands. In 1891, Knowlton L. Ames was appointed Northwestern's first football coach and work began constructing a stadium at the north end of campus that would be named Sheppard Field in honor of the University's business manager and lumber donor. football team. By 1892, football leagues began to be formed by Midwestern colleges and Northwestern. In 1895, Northwestern President Rogers joined with university presidents at the University of Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and Purdue to develop regulations for intercollegiate athletics. A year later, the universities agreed to create Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives, later the Western Conference, before ultimately becoming known as the Big Ten Conference after Indiana and Iowa joined in 1899 and Ohio State University joined in 1912. The University of Chicago would ultimately withdraw from the conference in 1946, and would be replaced by Michigan State University. Northwestern won its first Big Ten football championship in 1903, although the sport was banned for two years beginning in 1905 following fan violence. Men's basketball was introduced in 1901. Northwestern also had several athletics teams for women during this era including tennis, field hockey, and basketball teams. Continued expansion (1905‚Äì1939) :Includes the administrations of Abram W. Harris (1906‚Äì1916) and Walter Dill Scott (1920‚Äì1939) The university continued its expansion through the first half of the 20th century; opening several new professional schools, expanding the residential life on the Evanston campus, and establishing a campus for the professional schools in downtown Chicago. Although the University's tax-exempt status came into dispute, a 1908 Illinois Supreme Court removed the tax threat to university property. The original Patten Gymnasium was opened in 1908 to replace its dilapidated predecessor and house the burgeoning athletic programs. In 1914, the North Quads were completed as a part of a $500,000 Fraternity/Men's Dormitory plan. The buildings, designed by Palmer, Hornbostel, and Jones were planned in quadrangles and would house seven fraternities and four residence halls. Harris Hall opened in 1915, opposite University Hall, to house the social sciences and the new department of political science. Dyche Stadium, Northwestern's fourth football stadium, was completed in 1926 and opened with a capacity of 47,000 seats. The Women's Quads were dedicated in 1926 with 2 residential halls and 14 sororities. The Western Episcopal Seminary buildings were opened in 1928, and merged with the Seabury Seminary in 1933 to form the Seabury-Western Theological Seminary. Deering Library opened in 1933 and represented James Gamble Rogers' signature collegiate Gothic architectural style. While Lunt Hall had served as the university's primary library since 1894, by the 1920s the continued expansion of the university and its academic offerings demanded a new repository space. Charles Deering bequested $1 million for a project of the University's choosing after his death in 1927. James Gamble Rogers, having completed the Chicago campus, was retained again to design an expanded library. The Deering Library opened in January 1933, featured Roger's trademark collegiate neo-Gothic style, and had space for 500,000 volumes. The School of Commerce opened in 1908 in downtown Chicago under the leadership of economics professor Willard E. Hotchkiss. The school initially offered evening classes in accounting and business law before starting a bachelor of business administration program in 1912. The school became a founding member of the American Association of Collegiate Business Schools in 1917 and continued to formalize its curriculum over the next decade by introducing a full-time Bachelor of Science in Commerce on the Evanston campus, launching MBA and Ph.D. degrees, and establishing the second business research center in the nation. The College of Liberal Arts began offering evening courses for teachers in 1903 on the Evanston campus and in 1933 the popularity of the program led to the foundation of an evening undergraduate program on the Chicago campus named University College. The Medill School of Journalism was established in 1921 and named in honor of Chicago Tribune owner and editor Joseph Medill. The School of Education was founded in 1926. The Pharmacy school transferred to the University of Illinois in 1917. The Cumnock School of Oratory was renamed the School of Speech in 1921, and the theater department was merged into the same in 1926. The Northwestern University Press was opened in 1922. In 1920, Walter Dill Scott was inaugurated as the first non-Methodist University president and presided over the launch of a $25.3 million fund-raising campaign. The campaign brought several major changes that significantly centralized the university under Scott's administration, including the dissolution of boards of trustees for each of the professional schools, the replacing school-based alumni groups with a general alumni association, and moving forward with plans to purchase land in the Streeterville neighborhood of downtown Chicago to create a campus for the professional schools. By the time Franklyn Snyder replaced Scott as President in 1939, Scott's 19 years in office was more than twice as long as any previous President's tenure. A long-standing campaign to build a student activity center was reinvigorated by the announcement of his retirement and the resulting building was named in his honor. Completed in 1940, Scott Hall was designed by Rogers and featured an auditorium, offices for student and alumni organizations, conference and social rooms, and apartments for university guests. Homecoming became a regular fall event starting in 1911. \\"Go, U Northwestern\\" was written by Theodore Van Etten, a member of the university's marching band, and premiered during the final football game of the season in 1912. The first university student council was formed in 1914 and the first Waa-Mu show opened in 1929. Ken Huszagh was the first Northwestern athlete to participate in the Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the 100 meter freestyle and a silver in the 4 √ó 200 meter freestyle relay at the 1912 Summer Olympics. The athletic department adopted \\"Wildcats\\" as the moniker for Northwestern's athletic teams in 1924. The first NCAA men's basketball championship was held in Patten Gymnasium in 1939 where Oregon defeated Ohio State, 46‚Äì33. Northwestern won the first NCAA Fencing team championship in 1941. Chicago campus The Montgomery Ward Memorial Building on the Chicago campus. Northwestern's professional schools had been founded or affiliated with the university at various times in its history and consequently their facilities were scattered throughout Chicago. In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Scott's capital campaign, of land were purchased at the Corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920. George McKinlock donated $250,000 to have the campus named in honor of his son, Alexander McKinlock Jr. who died in World War I, but his financial losses during the Great Depression prevented him from fulfilling his pledge, so the university forgave his debt and the name defaulted to the Chicago campus instead. James Gamble Rogers was given a commission to create a master plan for the major buildings on the new campus which he designed in a collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to fund the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building to house the medical and dental schools and create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance. The building would become the first skyscraper housing academic facilities in the United States. In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law. The new campus comprising these three new buildings were dedicated during a two-day-long ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorn Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939. University of Chicago merger proposal In 1933, Robert Maynard Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, presented a proposal to Northwestern's Board of Trustees and President Scott to merge the two schools into an organization named the \\"Universities of Chicago\\". Motivated by financial difficulties of the Great Depression, both presidents envisioned the efficiencies to be achieved by merging the eighth-largest university in the nation by enrollments (Northwestern's approximately 14,000 students) with the 15th (Chicago's approximately 12,000 enrollments) and creating a three-campus system with graduate work based out of the Hyde Park campus, professional schools on Northwestern's newly opened Chicago campus, and undergraduate professional and liberal arts education on the Evanston campus. There were significant synergies to be achieved under the proposal, since Northwestern's poorly endowed Graduate School and School of Education would be assumed by Chicago's more prestigious programs while Chicago's unremarkable schools of law, commerce, and continuing education would be merged with Northwestern's more respected programs. The initial proposal was so secret that the investigatory committee was titled the \\"Special Committee on an Important Problem\\" but by November 1933 the proposal had become public knowledge and created a strong backlash among Northwestern students, faculty, and alumni as well as members of the Evanston community. Opponents accused the University of Chicago of attempting to appropriate Northwestern's tax-free charter to avoid $300,000 in annual taxes, while an anonymous author promised a $25 million endowment on the condition that there be only one university in the Chicago area, while still other rumors purported that the merger was a plan for the city of Chicago to annex Evanston. However, a significant stumbling block concerned each university's respective medical schools which differed significantly in their respective approaches to teaching and research. The concerted opposition by the medical school combined with the increasingly vocal concerns of the alumni, deans, and trustees as well as the untimely death of Melvin Taylor, who had led Northwestern's merger committee, caused both universities' boards of trustees to reject the proposal in February 1934. However, the resulting debates highlighted differences in philosophy regarding the scope and practice of undergraduate, graduate, and profession education, the relationship between teaching and research, the role of students, faculty, and alumni in determining a university's identity and mission, and a university's obligation to the city and nation. Despite the failure, both presidents supported the idea; Hutchins later lamented that the merger was \\"one of the lost opportunities of American education,\\" while Scott wrote that the merger's failure was \\"a great regret to me.\\" Swift Hall at Northwestern University (formerly the Swift Hall of Engineering Technological Institute Lakefill. The College of Engineering was initially founded in 1873 with a single degree program in engineering, but folded four years later due to a lack of funding. The program was re-opened in 1909, under the direction of the College of Liberal Arts and was housed in the Swift Hall of Engineering (given by Gustavus Swift) which also opened the same year. The program became an independent school in the mid-1920s and expanded significantly after Walter P. Murphy, a railroad entrepreneur, donated over $35 million in two separate bequests to build the Technological Institute and endow the school. The Technological Institute was designed by Holabird and Root and featured bas-reliefs designed by Edgar Miller \\"depicting man‚Äôs ongoing efforts to conquer nature\\" in Lannon stone. Construction required relocating the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house and Dearborn Observatory and demolishing Patten Gymnasium, which had been designed by George Washington Maher. The gymnasium was rebuilt further north of the Technological Institute. When \\"Tech\\" was completed in 1942, it contained 350 rooms and housing laboratories, classrooms, and offices for the four engineering departments as well as the chemistry and physics departments. Wartime (1939‚Äì1949) :Includes the administration of Franklyn Bliss Snyder (1939‚Äì1949) Antecedents In October 1916, Dr. Frederick A. Besley, a surgeon at the School of Medicine, began organizing a field hospital to support and assist the Allies in World War I. The doctors were drawn from Northwestern, Rush University Medical Center, the University of Illinois and nurses came from Cook County, Mercy, Augustana, and Evanston hospitals. The unit comprised 330 officers, doctors, nurses, and enlisted men and was officially titled the U.S. Army Base Hospital No. 12 (Chicago Unit) but was commonly known as the Northwestern University Base Hospital. The unit landed at Boulogne, France on June 11, 1917, to relieve the British Expeditionary Force's Base Hospital No. 18, making it the second U.S. hospital to reach France. Hospital No. 12 operated a 1,500 bed and is credited with treating 60,000 patients by the time it returned to the U.S. in April 1919. Two of the unit's commanding officers later became Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. 3,606 students served in World War I and 65 died by the 1918 armistice. Navy ROTC (NROTC) was established on campus at the request of President Scott in 1926. The founding of the program coincided with the establishment of NROTC branches at Harvard, Yale, Georgia Tech, the University of California, and the University of Washington. Pacifists disrupted a NROTC parade in the mid-1930s to protest the collaboration of a civilian university with the military as well as militarism in general, foreshadowing the controversies that would erupt during the late 1960s over the military presence on-campus. World War II The United States Navy trained over 36,000 sailors at Northwestern during World War II. Following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Northwestern President Franklyn Bliss Snyder telegraphed President Franklin D. Roosevelt to volunteer the \\"entire resources of the University.\\" The university admitted students who had finished three years of high school as well as instituting summer sessions to allow them to complete their degree requirements before the minimum draft age of 20. Notably, Northwestern switched its academic calendar from a semester to a quarter system to facilitate these changes and this quarter system persisted after the war into the present day. During the war, Northwestern trained 49,725 military personnel through eleven training programs. The existing NROTC program proved to be a boon to the university as the War Department and Navy used Northwestern facilities to train 36,124 sailors over the course of the war, leading Northwestern to be called the \\"Annapolis of the Midwest.\\" The programs included the Navy V-7 Naval Reserve Midshipman's School, V-5 Naval Aviation Preparatory Program, V-1 Accredited College Program, H-V(P) Medical and Dental Program, the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and training schools for cooks, bakers, and radio operators. The scale and importance of these programs led the Navy to cordon off the Lunt Building, Swift Hall, and Shanley Pavilion as well as taking over the dormitories and fraternities on the north campus. The Technological Institute housed training programs for the Radio School and V-12 Unit. The Army also established a signal corps training school on the Evanston campus and a civil affairs training school on the Chicago campus. The Midshipmen's Training School was the largest of these programs and was established in the newly constructed Abbott Hall dormitory on the Chicago campus in 1940. This school graduated 25 classes of \\"90-day wonders\\" (a total of 26,750 ensigns) by the end of the war, including future President John F. Kennedy. Northwestern's medical and dental schools prepared 761 doctors and 478 dentists for Army and Navy service. Additionally, General Hospital No. 12 was reactivated by Drs. Michael L. Mason and J. Roscoe Miller in February 1942 and supported the North African campaign from December 1942 to December 1943 and Italian campaign until the September 1945. Northwestern medical personnel also supported Station Hospital No. 48 which served during the Guadalcanal Campaign. Despite the extensive on-campus activity, enrollments plummeted from 19,691 in 1940 to 13,470 in 1944. In 1942, Snyder ordered that students of Japanese descent be barred from enrolling to comply with his interpretation of government internment policy, although this controversial decision was reversed after an outcry from the press and community. Over 11,000 alumni and 400 faculty and staff members fought in World War II and more than 300 died. 537 major decorations were awarded to Northwestern alumni, including two Medal of Honors awarded posthumously to John L. Jerstad and Walter E. Truemper. Post-war expansion As with other post-war American universities, Northwestern underwent a tremendous expansion to accommodate surging student enrollments. Over 28,000 applications were requested for the 1946 freshman class and by 1949, more than 9,000 students were enrolled on the Evanston campus alone. As early as January 1945, Northwestern had proposed between $17‚Äì28 million worth of new buildings in anticipation of post-war enrollments. Dozens of Quonset huts and other temporary structures were erected near Dyche Stadium, on the meadow in front of the Deering Library, and elsewhere on campus to house the influx of students returning to complete their educations under the G.I. Bill. Post-war transition (1949‚Äì1970) :Includes the administration of J. Roscoe Miller (1949‚Äì1970) Northwestern celebrated its centennial in 1951, and was the occasion to launch an $8.25 million fund raising campaign to build Centennial Hall and Memorial Hall on the Evanston campus and an Evening Study Hall on the Chicago campus. The centennial year celebrations consisted of five formal convocations, six academic conferences, a two-day Centennial Jubilee organized by the city of Evanston, and many other events by groups of students, alumni, and learned societies. In 1948, Melville J. Herskovits, a student of Franz Boas and founder of the University's anthropology department in 1928, launched the first major interdisciplinary program in African and African American studies, titled the Program of African Studies. In connection with this program, he aggressively expanded the existing Library of African Studies until his death in 1963. The library was named in his honor now possesses more than 285,000 volumes, 250 newspapers, and extensive collections of maps, posters, photographs, and other miscellaneous items that make this collection the largest in the world. Between 1949 and 1974, over forty buildings were constructed or remodeled on the Evanston campus. Sargent Hall opened in 1950, Shepard Hall opened in 1952, Kresge Hall, Bobb Hall, and McCulloch Hall opened in 1955, Elder Hall was completed in 1959, Allison Hall in 1960, and Alice Millar Chapel was finished in 1964. The first computer on campus was installed in Dearborn Observatory in 1949 and in 1950 a dedicated Computer Center opened featuring an IBM 650 mainframe computer. A $2 million IBM 709 was installed in July 1961 in the Technological Institute for computing satellite orbits among other problems. The Vogelback Computing Center was the first building to open on the Lakefill campus in October 1964. Starting in 1970, Northwestern's Chess program won eight of the first ten North American Computer Chess Championships. Lakefill campus * 1957 - The Rock first painted by Daily Northwestern staffers. * 1958 - The forerunner of Northwestern's TriQuarterly literary journal is started by English professor Edward Hungerford. * 1961 - Searle Student Health Center opens. * 1966 - Northwestern University Medical Center organized from seven hospitals affiliated with the university. * 1969 - Graduate School of Management formed and undergraduate School of Business discontinued. Associated Student Government formed out of the Student Senate. Big Ten athletics Northwestern received a bid to play in the 1949 Rose Bowl against California because Michigan, the Big 9 Conference champion, was barred from going in successive years. The game was memorable on several counts. Cal had a perfect 10‚Äì0 record going into the game and had averaged 28 points per game over the course of the season while the Wildcats had a record of 8‚Äì2 for the season to finish 2nd place in the conference. Although neither team had faced each other before, Coach Pappy Waldorf had been the Wildcats' head coach from 1935 until he left for the Golden Bears in 1946. NU's Coach Voight, only 33 years old, had played under Waldorf and had been named an All- American in 1938. In the first quarter, Frank Aschenbrenner broke a Rose Bowl record when he ran for a touchdown although the game remained close through the third quarter. Finally, with three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter and down by one point, Northwestern launched an drive including a Statue of Liberty play for a touchdown run to defeat Cal 20‚Äì14. Racial integration While Evanston and Chicago did not have the most oppressive Jim Crow laws in the country, in the post-War era the university and surrounding community remained highly conservative and resistant to changes in traditional social practices. Although as many as five black students were admitted every year, they were excluded from on-campus housing until the 1947 establishment of the euphemistically titled \\"International House\\" opened for black women. For example, when future mayor of Evanston, Lorraine H. Morton attended Northwestern in the early 1940s, she was not allowed to live in on-campus accommodations and had to board in a private home nearby.Northwestern University Archives, Lorraine H. Morton Papers, Box 1, \\"General Biographical Information\\". Retrieved July 16, 2013. Asbury Hall was purchased in 1949 to likewise house black men, but a group of progressive white students also moved in despite the wishes of Snyder's administration to keep the student housing segregated. Asbury would become a center for civil rights activism with its students organizing letter-writing campaigns to recruit more African American and Jewish American students to Northwestern despite the quotas imposed on these groups by the Admissions office. In the fall of 1956, Sherman Wu, son of Taiwan governor K.C. Wu, was granted a bid to pledge at the Psi Upsilon fraternity but was dismissed after his fellow pledges threatened to quit on account of his race. The fraternity stood by the decision to dismiss Wu stating, \\"Having an Oriental in the house would degrade [the fraternity] in the eyes of other fraternities and make it more difficult to get dates from the sororities.\\" Despite coming under increasing pressure after the story broke nationally, the administration asserted that it would not interfere with fraternities' selection processes. Wu received bids to pledge at two other fraternities, but it was not until the mid-1960s that racial and religious discrimination was outlawed in Greek organizations at Northwestern. Between 1966 and 1968, Northwestern increased African American enrollments from less than 50 to 160. After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, African American students on campus began expressing increasingly militant and separatist views demanding the administration increase recruitment activity and provide separate facilities for black students. After the university rejected their demands, on May 3, 1968, a group of 100 African American students identifying themselves as For Members Only and the Afro- American Student Union barricaded themselves the Bursar's Office and began a sit-in, demanding the university implement an admissions quota, increase financial aid, construct an all-black dorm and student center, create a Black Studies curriculum, and desegregate the university's real estate holdings in Evanston. In light of controversy surrounding the student protests at Columbia and Berkeley that spring, negotiations between Dean of Students Roland Hinz and AASU leader James Turner led to the sit-in dispersing peacefully after 38 hours. Although the administration rejected demands for racial preferences in admissions and financial aid, it made several concessions regarding desegregation, increasing student participation in policy matters, and developing a Department of African-American Studies. In March 1969, an incident involving a group of black students raiding the Triangle Fraternity house, a response to racial harassment of a black female co-ed, resulted in subsequent university disciplinary action against the students and led to a hunger strike by the For Members Only group to protest the allegedly unequal punishment of the black students and tacit support of racism on campus. Anti-war demonstrations Northwestern remained a staunchly conservative institution throughout its history and into the 1950s and 1960s; the University of Chicago often referred to its uptown rival as \\"Country Club U\\". A 1952 visit by Senator Joseph McCarthy was met by little protest and much acclaim from both the student body and faculty. However, Northwestern students became increasingly politically active and engaged in protests and strikes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was founded in 1965. Demonstrations mainly stemmed from student opposition to the Vietnam War but also included protests against the draft, Navy ROTC, defense industry corporations, and the Nixon administration as well as supporting affirmative action, environmentalism, women's rights, and other instances of New Left social activism. Despite the size of the protests, the student body was split between professionally oriented and traditional student body and activists. Some fraternities were known to antagonize protesters by playing patriotic music and jeering them from their houses. In addition to anti-war demonstrations, students also protested against the university's alleged complicity in the military industrial complex with regards to corporate and military recruitment on campus, military applications of research, and financial support by corporations and the military. Companies like Dow Chemical were targeted when they came on-campus to conduct interviews because of their involvement in the manufacture or research of war material and Navy ROTC activities were also frequent target of anti-war demonstrations. The Arch at Northwestern's entrance is situated at the intersection of Sheridan Road and Chicago Avenue, the site of the protest barricade After the Kent State shootings, the Northwestern student body and faculty senate voted to suspend classes starting May 6 and join a nationwide strike in protest of the Vietnam war and violence at Kent State. The student protesters demanded that campus security be disarmed, the university endowment divest itself from \\"war stocks\\", and Northwestern's NROTC program be stripped of academic credit and its facilities turned into a childcare center. Much to the consternation of Evanston residents, student protesters also erected a barricade at the major intersection of Sheridan Road and Chicago Avenue, both major thoroughfares in Evanston. A May 8 rally at Dyche Stadium that attracted approximately 5,000 students and community members prompted Evanston city officials to request activation of the National Guard, but this potential conflict was avoided after the Guard were diverted away from the stadium. The Rebecca Crown center, Vogelback computing center, and Lunt Hall (housing the NROTC program) were closed following disturbances by student protestors. On May 13, a group of at least 33 students vandalized the NROTC's headquarters, but this was the only violent episode of the strike. The strike ended and campus re-opened for class on May 13, the longest span of time Northwestern has ever been closed. Retooling era (1970‚Äì1994) :Includes the administrations of Robert H. Strotz (1970‚Äì1984) and Arnold R. Weber (1984‚Äì1994) Miller was promoted from President to Chancellor in March 1969 in the midst of student and faculty protests. The post remained vacant for sixteen months until Robert Strotz, a member of the Economics faculty since 1947 and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences since 1966, was unanimously elected by the trustees to be President in July 1970. While Strotz's appointment was opposed by the Daily Northwestern and the Associated Student Government president owing to his positions opposing the closure of campus and politicization of university classes, he was supported by the faculty. In 1972, students voted to change the name of the athletic teams from \\"Wildcats\\" to \\"Purple Haze,\\" but alumni and athletic directors opposed the change. A plan for a residential college system was proposed in the early 1970s in response to a 1969 faculty committee report recommending the creation of smaller intellectual communities. The first five residential colleges opened in 1972: Urban Studies, Philosophy and Religion, and three multi-thematic colleges Lindgren, Shepard, Willard. The Women's residential college opened in 1976, the Communications college in 1981, International Studies in 1981, Fine and Performing Arts in 1982, Commerce and Industry in 1984, and Public Affairs in 1992. Bernardine Dohrn, former member of the Weather Underground who was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for three years When Arnold R. Weber was elected president in 1985, the university not only was in the midst of a funding crisis after cuts in federal aid but was also suffering from diminished national prestige. In 1976, two years after he was tenured, Professor Arthur Butz published a Holocaust denial treatise titled The Hoax of the Twentieth Century. His controversial views highlighted the difficulties of balancing academic freedom of speech and the university's obligations to support tenured faculty, with the university's public image as Butz has been the subject of departmental censure, University press releases, and student and faculty petitions demanding his resignation. Northwestern also attracted controversy in 1991 for hiring former Weather Underground and FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive Bernardine Dohrn as an adjunct faculty member in the Law School. The tension of this time period was only exacerbated when, in 1990, the Evanston City Council attempted to impose the nation's first tax on college tuition for students studying at colleges in the city (including Northwestern University, Kendall College, Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, and Seabury-Western Theological Seminary) to cover a budget shortfall. The measure failed. The Northwestern football team was ranked first during the first two weeks of the season in 1962 and finished second in the Big Ten in 1970 and 1971. Between September 15, 1979, and September 25, 1982, the Wildcats beat the previous NCAA record losing streak of 28 games by losing 34 games in a row.

Schapiro (2009‚Äì ) David Protess launched the Medill Innocence Project in 1999, after he and students helped demonstrated the innocence of death row members. The Rock was moved to the east as part of a beautification project in the plaza between Harris Hall and University Hall, but cracked after workers dug up its foundation. In 1998, two former Northwestern basketball players, Kenneth Dion Lee and Dewey Williams, were charged and convicted for sports bribery. The players were part of a gambling ring and received money to fix three games against other Big 10 schools during the 1995 season. The football team became embroiled in a different betting scandal later that year when federal prosecutors indicted four former players for perjury related to betting on their own games. In August 2001, Rashidi Williams, a senior safety, collapsed and died during practice from an asthma attack. An autopsy revealed that he had ephedrine, a stimulant banned by the NCAA, in his system which prompted Northwestern to investigate the prevalence of stimulants and other banned substances across all of its athletic programs. Henry S. Bienen, a political scientist and dean of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, was elected president of Northwestern in June 1994. * 1995 - Henry Bienen becomes University President.

It is located near Owerri. The name may be written and pronounced as Iho. The majority of inhabitants of this community refer to it as Iho-Dimeze and are sometimes referred to as \\"Dimeze\\".  Geography  Iho Dimeze is made up of nineteen villages: Umuishi, Ishiafor Okpuala, Amukamara, Umuakpim, Ndiokwu, Obi-Umuori, Umunomo, Umuejike, Akpaka, Umuechem, Nowhere, Umushioke, Ezekwenjo, Umudim, Amaokwe-Okpuala, Umudimoche, Amueje, Umuezeala, and Umuagwu. Iho Dimeze is bordered by Akabo, Uzoagba, Ngugo, Atta (in Ikeduru LGA), Ogwa, and Mbieri (in Mbaitoli LGA).  Facilities  Iho Dimeze has one of the most prominent markets in Ikeduru and Mbaitoli LGAs called \\"Eke Ije Dibia\\" (popularly \\"Eke Iho\\"). Workers from other LGAs and states find it difficult to leave. Workers in other LGAs still live in and commute to and from Iho. Some named their children \\"Ihomezie\\" or \\"Ihomezirim\\", meaning \\"Iho blessed me\\".  Economy  Iho Dimeze people are predominantly farmers, traders and teachers. Ihuo is the headquarters of the Ikeduru Local Government Area. Petroleum exploration in Africa started at Iho-Dimeze, in Igboland by Shell D‚Äôarcy in the 1930s. Iho holds a large deposit of hydrocarbons that have not yet been tapped. The first commercial field was discovered in 1956 at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta.  History  The late ruler of Iho Dimeze was His Royal Highness Eze Ernest O. Onwuegbu Dimeze I of Iho Dimeze. Eze Onwuegbu ensured that traditions were maintained and respected. Ihuo has served as a home for many indigenes. A son of Iho Dimeze, David, commented that in spite of the role played by this community, it has been neglected by various administrations, at both local and state levels. Mazi Obinna Edoziem noted that no son or daughter of Iho Dimeze has been elected or appointed as Ikeduru LG Chairman, or supervisor at the LG level, by either military or democratic administrations, despite the fact that the headquarters of Ikeduru LGA is located in Iho.  Festivals  The people of Iho Dimeze are close-knit and celebrate many festivals and gatherings throughout the year. Many years before, the people of Iho Dimeze celebrated \\"Onwa Asa\\" and villages such as Umuokoro and Umuawom celebrated it as the \\"Orisha festival\\". The influence of Christianity has lessened interest in the festivals. In April of each year, the people of Iho Dimeze celebrate the \\"Isu Achara Festival\\" (Bush Burning Festival), where Okpuala and Amararuru Villages exhibit their traditional right to fix a date for the festival and display their masquerade dance (Igba Nmanwu). This festival attracts visitors from near and far. Many youths look forward to the festival every year and travel from Lagos, Port- Harcourt and Aba. \\"Ukwa\\" (breadfruit), a food presented to guests, is one of the most valuable foods in Igboland. Another event celebrated by Amarauru and Okpuala villages is the \\"Festival of Nmanya Ama\\", or \\"Nmii Ama\\".  Education  Iho Dimeze has one Secondary School, Iho Comprehensive Secondary School, and four elementary schools: Iho Central School, Iho Community School, Iho Community Primary School, and Iho Primary School.  Religion  The major churches are the Holy Trinity Church, Saint Mary's Catholic Church, St. Monica's Catholic Church, Christ Church Okpuala, Cherubim, Seraphim, and Holiness Evangelistic Church.

While the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs were formerly run by contractors on a non-profit basis, Brooks decided to change the contracts to a for-profit basis.

A few years later, former Los Alamos director Sig Hecker testified before Congress about the change, and stated: \\"When we went the direction of contractorization we made a grievous error pushing the laboratories in a direction that simply isn't right for this country and we've suffered from that.

Biography Born in Clusone, near Bergamo. By 1716, he had become an apprentice under Angelo Trevisani, but visited in 1723 the Roman studio of Angelo's brother, the Venetian Francesco Trevisani, and then also studied with Benedetto Luti. Nazari likely knew personally Fra Galgario, the renowned portraitist from Bergamo, and is described by some as a pupil. He returns to Venice in 1724, and is registered with the Fraglia dei Pittori by 1726. In 1744, he traveled to Frankfurt to paint the emperor Charles VII and his family and other members of the court. In 1756, he was inducted into the newly founded Accademia di Belle Arti of Venice. His son Nazario Nazari was also a painter, as was his daughter Maria. Among his patrons were Consul Joseph Smith and the former general Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg (who owned over eight diverse portrait paintings).

It is a member of the Building Societies Association. It was formed in 1975 by the merger of the Ipswich & District Building Society and the Ipswich & Suffolk Building Society. The Ipswich & Suffolk Building Society originated in the Ipswich and Suffolk Freehold Land Society, founded in December 1849. The FLS bought up land they divided up into plots that were big enough to qualify for the 40 shilling franchise that gave people the right to vote. It registered as the Ipswich and Suffolk Permanent Benefit Building Society in 1886 to provide mortgages for people buying land through the FLS.  History =Ipswich & Suffolk Building Society The Ipswich & Suffolk Building Society originated in 1849 as part of the forty-shilling freeholders movement, a project which aimed to make home ownership an option for ordinary people, rather than just the landed elite. Initially called the Ipswich & Suffolk Freehold Land Society, its first land acquisition was the Cauldwell Hall Estate, which it divided into 282 plots, selling each to a society member for ¬£23, following a ballot. It then made similar acquisitions and sales in various towns across Suffolk.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qWLNDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT133 p133 to 135 From 1868 the society started purchasing houses in addition to buying land, its first properties being located on Lancaster Road in Ipswich which it described \\"high quality, 2-bedroom, workman's houses\\". Ipswich & District Building Society The Ipswich & District Building Society was established in 1875 as a Starr-Bowkett Society. It held an inauguration meeting held at the Ipswich Lecture Hall, featuring a speech by Richard B. Starr, one of the architects of the Starr-Bowkett model. Starr stated that the society was not intended to be a rival to other building societies in the area, but to offer a new model of financial assistance for working-class people. Merger The Ipswich & Suffolk and the Ipswich & District merged in 1975, with the new entity trading simply as the Ipswich Building Society, a name it retains today. In 2004, after almost ninety years based in Upper Brook Street, Ipswich, the society moved its headquarters to a new venue at the Ransomes Europark. The old headquarters was retained as a branch, however. By 2011, the society had reached 65,000 members with assets of more than ¬£50,000. In 2020, the Ipswich Building Society launched a proposal for a further rename, to the Suffolk Building Society. It is consulting on the plans and will put it to a vote at the annual general meeting, with a view to implementing the change later in the year. Branches As of 2020, the Ipswich Building Society has nine branches in locations across Suffolk. There are two in Ipswich itself, as well as locations in Hadleigh, Aldeburgh, Halesworth, Haverhill, Saxmundham, Woodbridge, and Sudbury.

To date the Northwestern is the only vessel to have featured on all 16 seasons of Deadliest Catch as well as the pilot series America's Deadliest Season. The vessel is owned and operated by the Hansen family of the state of Washington with Sig Hansen serving as the vessel's primary captain.  History  The F/V Northwestern, a western rigged boat, was constructed in 1977 at Marco Shipyards in Seattle, Washington for the sole purpose of fishing King and Tanner Crab off of the coast of Alaska. It was christened F/V Northwestern on 1977 November 5 by Snefryd Hansen, the wife of then-owner and captain Sverre Hansen. The vessel is currently owned and operated by Sverre and Snefryd's three sons: Sigurd (Sig), Norman, and Edgar Hansen. Sig serves as the vessel's primary captain with his younger brother Edgar, and his daughter Mandy Hansen, also running the boat on occasion. Edgar primarily serves as the Northwestern's deck boss. Edgar also served as relief captain and engineer for several years, before Mandy took over as the full-time relief captain, and Norman took over as the primary engineer. Sig Hansen in front of the F/V Northwestern Edgar Hansen, 2011 In the 1980's the boat was one of the first to fish opilio crab. Throughout the 1980's the Northwestern kept very busy year round, fishing opilio crab, blue king crab, red king crab, and brown king crab at different times of the year. To keep up with the increasing demand for crab in the late 1980's and early 1990's, boats needed to carry more pots (steel box shaped traps that are used to fish for crab). Rather than buy a new boat, the Hansen family decided to have the Northwestern extended twice. Originally built at 108 feet (32.9 m) with the ability to carry 156 pots, the Northwestern was extended to 118 feet (36.0 m) in 1987 to allow for 200 pots. In 1991, when the maximum crab pots a boat could carry was raised to 250, the Hansens again had the Northwestern lengthened, this time to . Today, in the IFQ system, they usually carry no more than 195 pots. The Hansen brothers worked aboard the Northwestern as deckhands throughout their childhood, and all three decided to make fishing their profession, joining a long line of Hansen men making their living as fishermen. Sig, the oldest of the three, took over as captain of the Northwestern full-time in 1990. Under his leadership, the Northwestern boasts an astounding record of never having suffered a death at sea despite its home territory being the dangerous Alaskan crab grounds, where deaths average nearly one fisherman per week during the heart of its productive seasons.  Current status  Today, the Northwestern continues to fish red king crab, tanner crab, and opilio crab; however, it is now one of few boats to engage in pot cod fishing as well, which was filmed for episodes of Deadliest Catch during the 2006 Opilio crab season. The Northwestern was one of the few vessels to fish for blue king crab in 2009 after completing its red king crab season. During the summer, the vessel keeps busy tendering (transporting fish from vessels at sea to floating processors, allowing the fishing boats to stay on the grounds rather than make repeated trips back to port) salmon and herring, usually under the command of Edgar Hansen. The Northwestern is one of the most successful boats in the crab fishing fleet. It continues to meet its quota and bring in money for the crew and family; the vessel won both the tonnage and price titles in both the final king crab derby in 2005 and the final opilio crab derby in 2006, and as a result, her share of the available quota under the new IFQ fishing rules is among the largest in the fleet. The vessel has become popular and very recognizable due to it being prominently featured in the Discovery Channel series Deadliest Catch. In addition to the Hansen brothers, the remainder of the crew includes longtime deckhands Matt Bradley (Edgar's childhood friend), Nick Mavar, Jr. and Nick's nephew, Jake Anderson. Jake earned full-share deckhand status on the Northwestern during the 2009 opilio season, and continued to fish on the boat several more seasons before taking over as captain of the F/V Saga in 2014. Matt would also leave the boat on occasions as well and has since joined Jake on the Saga by the 2019 king crab season. Karl Rasmussen, the grandson of one of the Northwestern's quota leasers, joined the crew in 2014. Sig's daughter Mandy, has fished on the boat during salmon season, and she had been an intermittent crew member during earlier seasons of the show. Before the 2016 red king crab season, Sig's son-in-law, Clark Pederson (Mandy's husband), became the latest to join the Northwestern crew. During the middle of the 2018 opilio season, Mandy has started training under her father to become the Northwestern's relief captain. By the start of the 2018 king crab season, she permanently joined the crew as full-time relief captain and captain-in-training, with Sig grooming her to one day take over the family business. In the summer of 2019, Mandy and Clark alternated to run the boat, for salmon tendering. During the boat's first trip, right before the start of the 2019 red king crab season, Mandy took the boat out by herself for the first time as captain, to set up storage pots out in the fishing grounds, before Sig came up to take control of the boat, for the season. In the summer of 2020, Mandy and Clark once again took control of the Northwestern for salmon tendering season.  Non-Alaskan seafood  The Hansen brothers, owners/operators of the Northwestern, endorsed a brand of Russian King Crab being sold at discount chains such as Walmart. The decision to put the Northwestern name and colors on a non-Alaskan product has caused some controversy in the Alaskan fishing community, which the Hansens addressed in a November 2007 press release.Northwestern Endorses King Crab, press release, dated November 12, 2007; retrieved April 5, 2008. In the press release, the Hansens noted that 50-70 percent of Alaskan King Crab was purchased by Japan and never reached U.S. stores or restaurants; by bringing Russian King Crab to the American market, the Hansens hoped that the increased demand for King Crab would benefit the Alaskan fishing fleet by raising the price of King Crab overall.

She was one of the first thirty women in the United States to earn a PhD in history.Byers, Inzer (1979). \\"Annie Heloise Abel\\". In Mainiero, Lina (ed.). American Women Writers: A Critical Reference Guide from Colonial Times to the Present. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. pp. 7‚Äì9. One of the ablest historians of her day, Abel was an expert on the history of British and American Indian policies. As another historian has put it: \\"She was the first academically trained historian in the United States to consider the development of Indian- white relations and, although her focus was narrowly political and her methodology almost entirely archival-based, in this she was a pioneer.\\"  Early life and education Annie Heloise Abel was born at Fernhurst, Sussex, England. She emigrated to the U.S. in 1885, following her parents who were settling in Salina, Kansas for the second time. Her father worked as a gardener and her mother ran a small family farm. Abel attended Salina High School, graduating in 1893. She immediately began teaching in the Kansas public schools. In 1895, Abel began studies at the University of Kansas, where her undergraduate studies were free.Prucha, F. P. ‚ÄúAnnie Heloise Abel‚Äù in Notable American Women, 1607-1950, E. T. James et al., eds. (1971). After two years of high school teaching, she attended the University of Kansas for her M.A. in History. Under the direction of Kansas historian Frank Haywood Hodder, Abel wrote an M.A. thesis entitled: \\"Indian Reservations in Kansas and the Extinguishment of Their Title.\\"James C. Malin, \\" Frank Heywood Hodder, 1860-1935\\" Kansas State Historical Quarterly 5 (May 1936),115-121. Based on that work, her Kansas advisor there recommended her for PhD coursework at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and Abel began her studies there in 1900.Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, 1922, Annual Yearbook, p. 15. After her potential advisor, Moses Coit Tyler, died, she decided to leave Cornell, and return to Kansas. To pay for graduate tuition, she returned to teaching high school from 1901 to 1903. In 1903, with the encouragement of Kansas faculty, Abel applied for a Bulkley Scholarship in American History to fund her PhD degree at Yale University. When her sister, Rosa Abel, begin PhD work in English Literature at Yale, Abel moved to New Haven to take up her studies at Yale University. She intended to focus on Native Americans and U.S. Indian policy, a topic no professional historians had researched in detail.Max Binheim, ed. \\"Rosa Abel Wright,\\" Women of the West, (Los Angeles, CA 1928), p. 205-206. At Yale, Abel studied with Edward Gaylord Bourne. She was the first person to use and analyze Indian Office records to understand federal policy and the idea of Indian Removal. Her dissertation, entitled ‚ÄúThe History of Events Resulting in Indian Consolidation West of the Mississippi,‚Äù was published in the Annual Report (1907) of the American Historical Association. It became the standard work on federal policies resulting in Indian Removal. Her thorough research of Indian Office and congressional records became a model for the first generation of scholars and Native activists to criticize those policies.  Early career: research and academic achievements  The American Historical Association awarded her the Justin Winsor Prize in 1906 for her early work. That prize, created by the American Historical Association to recognize the best manuscript in the history of the Western Hemisphere, made Annie Abel an authority on national Indian policy. Because only teaching colleges or women's colleges would hire women, it took her some years to find full-time academic work. Abel served briefly as the Historian for the U.S. Indian office and taught part-time at Goucher College, a women's college outside of Washington, DC. She became active in local suffrage politics after she became a citizen in 1910.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington, D.C.; Naturalization records; NAI Number: 654310, Annie Heloise Abel, 1910, Baltimore, Maryland. She was hired as a faculty member at Smith College in Northampton Massachusetts in 1908 and spent 12 years teaching there, moving up the academic ladder. While conducting research in Australia, she met and married George Cockburn Henderson, an Australian historian, in October 1922, in Adelaide, Australia. The following year he had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized in June 1923. Abel then returned to the United States.[8] The marriage was later dissolved.[9] During the 1924‚Äì1925 school year Abel taught history at Sweet Briar College in Aberdeen, Washington. Her parents and several siblings had settled in southwest Washington state in the 1910s where logging and fishing had brought a booming population. After she received the Alice Freeman Palmer Traveling Fellowship awarded by the American Association of University Women in 1925, she resumed her intensive research in England and Australia.  Later career and publication record  In 1928 Abel- Henderson was appointed professor of history at the University of Kansas. She left after only one semester when she received a two-year research grant from the Social Science Research Council. Those funds enabled her to travel to Canada, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis, Missouri, and to continue her studies on British policies toward Australian aborigines. In the 1930s, she retired to Aberdeen, Washington, but continued her scholarship by receiving foundation and library study awards. She wrote four books in the 1930s, but turned her attention to publishing valuable accounts of western travel, the fur trade, and Indian policy that she had unearthed in her research. She edited the letters, diaries, and account books of Francis A. Chardon, a fur trader who had traveled and lived among American Indians on the Upper Missouri from 1834 to 1839. Abel published that rare account of life in the Upper Missouri River in 1932. She and her sister, Rose Abel Wright, also with a Yale PhD, collaborated on translating and editing another trader's account that Abel found among French geographer Joseph Nicollet's papers that ended up in the U.S. War Department Library. This account of a French expedition along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers in 1803‚Äì1805 overlapped with the U.S. Lewis and Clark expedition and left a vital map that remained unknown until Abel and her sister brought it to life. That edition of the Loisel expedition, was titled Tabeau‚Äôs Narrative of Loisel‚Äôs Expedition to the Upper Missouri, and published in 1939. After World War Two ended, Abel-Henderson and her sisters worked with the British-American War Relief Association in Seattle, helping to resettle British families in the Pacific North West. Abel-Henderson also founded a chapter of the Daughters of the British Empire, an organization that supported retirement homes from British emigres. In 1946 the British government decorated her for her work.[3] Annie Abel died of cancer in 1947 and was buried with her parents and sisters in Montesano Washington. When Abel died, she had two books in progress, one a comparative history of British, U.S. and Australian Native policies and the other a comparative history of suffrage. Works Her works include: * Her master's thesis: * Her doctoral dissertation: Chardon's journal at Fort Clark, 1834-1839; Abel's papers may be found in the repository of Washington State University Libraries, in Pullman, WA.

The current bridge was constructed in 1929, and was designated as a nationally Important Cultural Property in July 2004. Outline The current bridge contains six arches and is made of reinforced concrete with granite siding. It is 306.9 meters long, 21.9 meters wide, and has two car lanes in each direction. The Bandai Bridge is a prime example of large-scale concrete arch bridges from the Showa Period, and was strong enough not to collapse during the 1964 Niigata earthquake which destroyed large sections of Niigata. Today the Bandai Bridge is considered the symbol of the city of Niigata and is one of the city's most scenic spots, especially when lit up at night. In April 2004, the bridge celebrated its 75th anniversary by being designated as a national Important Cultural Property. This same year, much of the bridge was reconstructed to resemble the original model. Geography The Bandai Bridge is located on the Shinano River, and is separated from the river mouth by only the Yachiyo and Ryuto bridges. North of the bridge are the Furumachi and Honcho shopping districts, and south of the bridge are the Bandai shopping district, the Niigata West Port (Bandaijima) district, and Niigata Station. Japan National Route 7 crosses the bridge, connecting Niigata Station to the areas south of the Shinano River. First incarnation The first Bandai Bridge was constructed out of wood in 1886, during the Meiji Period, and was the first bridge to cross the Shinano River. Because of the inconvenience of crossing the river by boat between Niigata and former Nuttari, the heads of Niigata Nippo newspaper and Daishi Ginko bank oversaw construction to encourage trade between the two communities. The original bridge was 782 meters long, the longest bridge in Japan at the time, and 2.5 times the current length as the river has grown significantly narrower since. Possibly because of high tolls on the privately owned bridge, in the beginning there were few users. In 1900, the prefectural government took over control of the bridge's finances and made it toll-free. In March 1908, a major fire which destroyed 1,770 houses in Niigata also destroyed more than half of the Bandai Bridge. Second incarnation The second Bandai Bridge was completed in December 1909, and quickly became the transportation hub of the growing city of Niigata. The new bridge was built using planks recovered from the remains of the 1908 fire as a base, and was the same size as the original model. Pieces of the first and second incarnations of the Bandai Bridge can be seen on display in the underground crossing of the Bandai shopping district. Third (current) incarnation Due to dilapidation of the second bridge, a third version was constructed in 1929 using reinforced concrete. Because of water diversion projects along the Shinano River throughout the early 20th century, the water level at the time of construction had decreased from 770 meters to 270 meters since the construction of the first bridge. Because of this, the third bridge was far shorter yet wider in order to allow for easy passage of automobiles. On August 28, 1948, during the Niigata Festival a fireworks accident on the bridge caused over 100 spectators to fall into the Shinano River, resulting in 29 casualties. Since then, all bridges across the river have become off limits to spectators during fireworks shows. On June 16, 1964, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Niigata, causing major damage to nearly all bridges on the Shinano River. Although the base of the Bandai Bridge on both sides sunk approximately 1.2 meters, the bridge was left intact. Because automobiles were still able to cross the Bandai Bridge (and only the Bandai Bridge), it allowed for quick aid to arrive for many on the isolated north side of the river. In 1985, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first bridge, new lanterns were added to the bridge to decorate the night skies. In August 1989, a folk-dance procession across the bridge was started as part as the annual Niigata Festival, and is now one of the festival's trademarks.

Meine was a right-handed pitcher who played for the St. Louis Browns in 1922 and for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1929 to 1934. He was given the nickname \\"The Count of Luxemburg\\" on account of his operating a speakeasy/tavern in the Luxemburg section of St. Louis. He led the National League in wins and innings pitched in 1931 and compiled a 66‚Äì50 record in seven seasons of Major League Baseball. Spitball years Born to parents of German descent and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Meine served in the United States Army during World War I. \\"Henry William Meine was born on May 1, 1896 in an unincorporated area called Luxemburg in the predominantly German neighborhood known as Carondelet bordering the Mississippi River in south St. Louis, Missouri. Meine's parents were both children of German immigrants; Henry (born in 1864) and Louisa (nee Kulhman, born in 1873) married in 1891 and had seven children, Lilly, Henry, Edwin, Arthur, Charles, Ferdinand, and Walter, born between 1892 and 1908.\\" After a tip that Meine, who was playing semipro ball in 1920, threw \\"a good spitball\\", he was signed to play professional baseball for Beaumont in the Texas League. Meine made his professional baseball debut in 1921 at age 25. He entered professional baseball the same year that the spitball, Meine's mainstay, was outlawed. Interviewed in 1963, Meine recalled: > After the Carl Mays-Ray Chapman accident in 1920, baseball outlawed all > freak pitches and trick deliveries. I had one break. Either the news was > slow in reaching Texas or they didn't care what the rest of the world did. > The spitball was still a legal pitch in the Texas League in 1921. I could > use it, but I knew if I wanted to go to the majors I'd have to change over > completely. In the years that followed, Meine was forced to develop new pitches. He became a control pitcher who did not pitch with great velocity, but could hit his spots. Some referred to him as a \\"junk man\\" or a \\"junkballer.\\" St. Louis Browns and minor leagues In 1922, Meine was sold to the St. Louis Browns but he appeared in only one game for the club, pitching four innings in relief. After the 1922 season, Meine spent three years in the minor leagues, pitching for the Syracuse Stars and Kansas City Blues. In 1926, he compiled a 17‚Äì14 record with a 3.27 ERA. Despite the 17-win season, Meine quit baseball after the 1926 season. He recalled, \\"It didn't look like I was going up, and I just retired. I had other income and didn't have to play baseball.\\" Speakeasy operator Meine owned a speakeasy in the St. Louis area. Sportswriter Red Smith recalled spending a few hours there as a young reporter and later wrote: \\"Heinie's store was genteel in a knock-down-drag-out way, and the specialty of the house in those prohibition days was a brand of Moose Milk that would peel the paint off a battleship.\\" He was known through his career \\"The Count of Luxemburg,\\" because he lived and operated his tavern in the unincorporated area south of St. Louis that was known as Luxemburg. When Pittsburgh outfielder Paul Waner showed up smelling of liquor and with eyes squinting for a 1932 game at Sportsman's Park in St Louis, the Cardinals' manager asked if Waner had a rough night. Waner replied, \\"Rough night? What a host that Meine is.\\" In 1930, with Prohibition still in effect, one newspaper account reported that Meine owned \\"a soft drink parlor\\" in St. Louis. St. Louis sportswriter Bob Broeg noted that Meine's tavern was known for its \\"gem√ºtlichkeit.\\" Return to baseball in 1928 Meine later recalled that the patrons at his drinking establishment motivated him to return to baseball: \\"In 1928, some of the boys in the tavern kept riding me, saying that I could win in semipro ball and in the minors, but never in the majors. So I rejoined Kansas City for part of the season and was up with Pittsburgh in '29.\\" Meine compiled a 7‚Äì4 record for the Kansas City Blues in 1928. In 1929, he signed with the Pirates at age 33. He appeared in 22 games, 13 as a starter, for the 1929 Pirates, compiling a 7‚Äì6 record. Second retirement A throat condition limited Meine's playing time during the 1930 season. He had been scheduled to pitch the season opener, but was unable to play due to an attack of tonsilitis. He didn't appear in a game for the Pirates until May 5, when he gave up three runs in relief against the New York Giants. He left the team in mid-August due to illness, and was \\"placed on the voluntary retired list.\\" In December 1930, it was determined that his tonsils had caused his illness, and he had them removed. Having been placed on the retired list, Meine was required to apply to Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis seeking reinstatement. A total of 12 Pirates players, including future Hall of Famers Pie Traynor, Paul Waner, and Lloyd Waner, also had their tonsils removed. An Associated Press story in January 1931 noted: \\"The Pittsburgh Pirates think the reason they didn't finish higher in the National League race last season was because their tonsils were not so good. And if they're right, the boys point out, they should be one of the healthiest teams in the land this year.\\" Comeback in 1931 at age 34 Returning to baseball sans tonsils, Meine had the best year of his career in 1931. Having never won more than seven games in a season for the Pirates, Meine compiled a 19‚Äì13 record for the 1931 Pirates. In his first two games against the 1931 St. Louis Cardinals, he pitched shutouts against the group that went on to win 101 games and the 1931 World Series. He won his 19th game on September 23, 1931, pitching 13 innings in a 3‚Äì2 win over the Phillies. His 1931 performance led the National League in wins (19), innings pitched (284), and batters faced (1,202), and ranked fourth in earned run average (2.98). After the 1931 season, Meine participated in an exhibition game at St. Louis between Max Carey's All-Stars (an all-star team of major leaguers) and the St. Louis Stars of the Negro Leagues. Meine gave up 10 runs as the Stars won 10‚Äì8. The game may have inspired Kevin King's 2007 fictional account of a Negro League team defeating a team of major league all-stars. In King's account, Negro League star Mule Suttles tries to recall the list of major league all-stars who played in the game: \\"Heinie Manush, Heinie Meine, Heinie Schuble. They had Heinies coming out of the hiney, and we kicked their hineys.\\" Holdout season of 1932 In 1932, Meine was a holdout, refusing to accept the contract terms offered by the Pirates and declining to report to spring training in Paso Robles, California with the rest of the team. Meine's holdout continued into May, making him the last player continuing to hold out for better contract terms. On May 16, 1932, The Pittsburgh Press referred to Meine as the \\"obstinate Pittsburgh holdout\\" and reported that the Pirates were trying to strike a deal to send Meine to the Brooklyn Dodgers. Meine ultimately reached terms with the Pirates in late May. After his holdout, Grantland Rice reported that Meine was being paid $11,500 for the year. Rice wrote a column praising Meine: > Meine was the hardest working pitcher in the National League last season. He > hurled 22 complete games, worked 284 innings, won 19 games against 13 lost, > and yielded an earned run average of 2.98. And all of this he did with a > fifth place club. When he led the Pirates to a 2‚Äì1 victory over Brooklyn in June 1932, The New York Times opened its game coverage as follows: \\"Heine Meine came to Ebbets Field with the Pirates yesterday and gave 18,000 fans an exhibition of his very best pitching by holding the Carey clan to five hits in seven innings.\\" Meine compiled a 12‚Äì9 record and a 3.86 ERA in 1932. 1933 and 1934 seasons When Meine signed his 1933 contract with the Pirates in January, the Associated Press noted that \\"such well-known exponents of the art of arguing over salary matters as Floyd Caves Herman and Heinie Meine, meekly came to terms.\\" The New York Times referred to Meine as the \\"ace of the Pirates' pitching staff\\" and reported that his contract was for five figures and was for one year. He opened the season with a record of 5‚Äì0 to lead the National League in late May. When the Pirates honored Honus Wagner with a tribute day in May 1933, Meine pitched a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers. After a mid-season slump, Meine began to turn things around in late July. After pitching three shutout innings in relief to help the Pirates come from behind against the Giants, The Pittsburgh Press reported: \\"Just when all hope was being lost for him, Heinie Meine came back yesterday to confound the critics with a brilliant bit of relief pitching. The Duke of Luxembourg throttled the Giants ...\\" Meine finished the 1933 season with a 15‚Äì8 record and a 3.65 ERA, helping lead the Pirates to an 87‚Äì67 record and a second-place finish in the National League. Meine returned to the Pirates in 1934 for his final year in Major League Baseball. He was the Pirates' starter in the season opener, but allowed seven runs in a 7‚Äì1 loss to the Cardinals at St. Louis. Used increasingly in relief, Meine appeared in 26 games, 14 as a starter. He compiled a 7‚Äì6 record and a 4.32 ERA. When Meine pitched a complete game, 4‚Äì1 victory over the Cubs in August 1934, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported: \\"Heinie Meine, a wobbly old timer who had pitched only one complete game this year, this afternoon felt no aches and pains in standing the Cubs on their heads for nine innings.\\" His final major league appearance came in a 9‚Äì4 loss to the Dodgers on September 18, 1934 at Ebbets Field. Meine pitched one-third of an inning in relief and gave up four earned runs. For his career, he compiled a 66‚Äì50 record in 165 appearances, with a 3.95 ERA and 199 strikeouts. Family and later years Meine was married to Grace Bonds in November 1921. Their son, Howard Meine, pitched in St. Louis municipal baseball for several years. After retiring from baseball, Meine returned to his tavern business. He also operated a baseball school at 153 Lemay Ferry Road south of St. Louis. He constructed a building with locker facilities for 50 to 60 boys. He hired former major league players, including Marty McManus, Vern Stephens, Phil Todt, and Monty Stratton, to work at the school and advertised his courses in The Sporting News. Meine also helped develop the Lemay Baseball Association in St. Louis, building a field next to his tavern and maintaining it himself. Heine Meine Field, built by Meine, remains in use as a baseball field.Our Hallowed Ground, by Christy Marshall, St. Louis Magazine, April 2008. Meine's hobbies in his later years included hunting, fishing and bowling. In March 1968, Meine died of cancer at the Alexian Brothers Hospital in St. Louis.

It belongs to the group of procedures called Atmospheric correction for the process of removing the effects of the atmosphere on the reflectance values of images taken by satellite or airborne sensors. The code operates on the basis of an SOS (successive orders of scattering) method and accounts for the polarization of radiation in the atmosphere through the calculation of the Q and U components of the Stokes vector.

The phrase \\"a satisfactory environment\\" was deleted and replaced by \\"more sustainable settlements and adequate shelter for all\\". This terminology derived from the Habitat Agenda that was agreed at the 1996 UN Habitat II meeting in Istanbul. It reflected the start of an increasingly close link between CAP and UN Habitat. The association produces newsletters roughly three times a year, and holds conferences for planning theorists and practitioners. CAP was led by Heriot-Watt professor Cliff Hague from 2000‚Äì2006, under whom the association played a significant role in developing \\"new urban planning\\" in response to the rapid urbanisation and increased slum settlements in cities across the globe. From 2006‚Äì10 he was Secretary-General of CAP. Since 2010 Clive Harridge has been Secretary- General. CAP works with the Commonwealth Association of Architects, the Commonwealth Engineering Council and the Commonowealth Association of Surveying and Land Economy: these act together as Built Environment Professions in the Commonwealth (BEPIC). CAP also works with other Commonwealth partners as ComHabitat. CAP led the case for the \\"re-invention\\" of planning at the 2006 UN Habitat World Urban Forum, where a book was launched to support this advocacy. The book. Making Planning Work: A Guide to Approaches and Skills was published by Earthscan. In 2010 CAP has produced two Discussion Papers published by the Commonwealth Secretariat.

Image of Lapan- TUBsat, now can only be received by Lapan ground station in Rumpin, West Java, called remote sensing image for West Indonesia. Afterward, ground station in Pare Pare, South Celebes and Biak Island, Papua, will be built to receive image from remote sensing satellite for Middle and East Indonesia. Before this discovery, image input and satellite data for the observation need, are received from other countries‚Äô natural resources satellites, such as Landsat and NOAA (United States), SPOT (France), Radarsat (Canada), JRS (Japan), and also Feng Yun (China).

It is a member of the Building Societies Association. The Society was founded in 1923 by local estate agent John Oliver Watkins and a group of local business men as a mutual organisation to allow purchases of new homes in the aftermath of the First World War. Today it is one of only three remaining building societies based in Wales and the only building society or bank with its headquarters in Wales west of Cardiff. At 31 December 2019, the Society's total assets were over ¬£370m with some 19,750 saver accounts and 1,800 mortgage accounts. The chief executive is Alun Williams. Swansea Building Society benefited from the Icelandic financial crisis in 2009, as local savers looked to invest in a safer institution. The Society has since continued to grow by opening three branches in Carmarthen, Cowbridge and Mumbles in recent years. In 2019, it relocated its main branch to Portland Street in Swansea city centre, retaining and refurbishing its previous premises to host its expanding Head Office functions. The Society remains entirely mutual and independent in its outlook, relying only on funding from its Members through savings accounts and not using any retail funding or HM Treasury funding subsidies. It provides a personalised and face-to-face mortgage service for its customers rather than using automated vetting. This approach delivers flexible solutions and safe lending with Society mortgage provisions (2019) of 0.08% (0.29% industry sector average) and payment arrears of 0.05% (0.69% of peer average). In May 2010, the Society launched a savings account in partnership with Swansea City A.F.C., earning the club additional revenue through commission. The Society is now a sponsor for Swansea City A.F.C. and retains its close links with its community and local charities.

This power transmission system has a capacity of 10.6 gigawatts from east to west, and sends electric power to Southern California's massive population centers of Los Angeles and San Diego from many different sources, including hydroelectric dams (Hoover Dam on the Colorado River), fossil fuel plants (Chuck Lenzie Generating Station in North Las Vegas, Nevada), nuclear plants (Palo Verde Nuclear Plant, near Phoenix, Arizona), and more recently, utility-scale solar plants (Ivanpah Solar Power Facility) Individual power lines of Path 46 Supporting system (230 kV only): *El Centro - Imperial Valley 230 kV *Ramon - Mirage 230 kV *Coachella - Mirage 230 kV Southern System (500 kV only): *North Gila - Imperial Valley 500 kV *Palo Verde - Devers 500 kV No.1 Northern System: *Marketplace - Adelanto 500 kV - although this line is called Path 64, it is part of Path 46. *Eldorado - Lugo 500 kV *Eldorado - Lugo 230 kV lines 1 & 2 *Mohave - Lugo 500 kV *Julian Hinds - Mirage 230 kV *McCullough - Victorville 500 kV lines 1 & 2 *Hoover - Victorville 287 kV Although the Intermountain HVDC line follows the route of the northern system (specifically, the Hoover - Victorville and McCullough - Victorville lines) the DC line is not considered part of Path 46. Instead, the line is a distinct path: Path 27. Route of the 500 kV lines=North Gila - Imperial Valley (SDG&E;) This power line, maintained by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E;), begins at the Imperial Valley substation located northwest of Calexico between the United States-Mexico border to the south and Interstate 8 to the north. The same substation is also the northern end of Path 45, an international power transmission corridor linking the Western US power grid to Baja California, Mexico's power grid. Leaving the substation, the line travels parallel at a distance to the south of the Interstate 8 as both head east through Imperial Valley. Just past the Hwy 98 interchange with the Interstate 8 southeast of El Centro, the line then runs adjacent to Interstate 8, as infrastructure bunches up to cross the shifting sand dunes. For the next 10 miles (16 km), the line is squeezed tightly between the Interstate 8 and the US-Mexico border until both turn northeast. As the Interstate 8 crosses over the All-American Canal, the line spans over and departs the freeway, continuing to the northeast. The line reaches the foothills north of Yuma and turns east. Abruptly, after crossing the Colorado River, the power line turns south and heads into the North Gila substation. Another 500kv line, Palo Verde - North Gila, connects the North Gila substation to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. The section of line east of the Colorado River is referred to as Path 21.Route descriptions are based on Google Earth images. Devers - Palo Verde No. 1 (SCE) Also called DPV1, this power line is owned and maintained by Southern California Edison (SCE). Starting from the Devers substation northeast of the San Gorgonio Pass and north of the Interstate 10, the line runs north of and roughly parallel to the Interstate 10 as both head southeast and passes by Palm Springs. After dropping in elevation to near sea level in the Coachella Valley near Indio, both the line and the Interstate 10 climb about 1600-ft out of the Coachella Valley and into Shavers Valley. Upon entering Shavers Valley, the line crosses over I-10 east of the Cactus City exit and continues to the south parallel with the freeway as both continue easterly across the Colorado Desert region of the Sonoran Desert. Both pass Chiriaco Summit and Desert Center with the line never more than 1.5 miles south of the freeway. About 5 miles after passing the Chuckawalla Valley State Prison, the line leaves the freeway and turns south-east for a few miles before turning east in the Palo Verde Valley and crossing the Colorado River south of Blythe. Like the North Gila - Imperial Valley line, the section of this power line east of the Colorado River is also referred to as Path 21. The power line eventually terminates at the Hassayampa switch yard substation adjacent to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station along with the North Gila - Imperial Valley line mentioned above. A second 500-kV transmission line to be called Devers - Palo Verde No. 2 (DPV2) is planned to run parallel to the existing Devers - Palo Verde line. Mohave - Lugo (SCE) Starting from the Lugo substation in Hesperia, this 500 kV power line heads generally northeast along with the Eldorado - Lugo 500 kV line and two other 230 kV power lines. Both lines cross vast expanses of desert and mountains as they head towards Nevada. Just south of Interstate 40, the Mohave - Lugo line splits from the Eldorado - Lugo line; the Mohave line turns and heads in a more easterly direction than the other power lines. The line roughly parallels Interstate 40 at a large distance up to the California border. The power line then heads northeast to the Mohave Power Station at Laughlin, Nevada. The line terminates there along with another SCE 500 kV line from Eldorado substation. Eldorado - Lugo (SCE) The Eldorado - Lugo 500 kV line follows the same exact path as the Mohave - Lugo 500 kV until south of Interstate 40. The line then continues northeast through the Mojave desert along with other 230 kV power lines. Although the power lines generally parallel Interstate 15 through the Mojave desert, they do so at a very large distance and are completely out of sight. As the set of power lines leaves California and enters Nevada, they rises to an elevation of before turning to head north-northeast and descending into Eldorado Valley. The 500 kV power line then joins two other SCE 500 kV powerlines, one from the Mohave Power Station in Laughlin, and the other an SCE-built extension of Path 21 from Moenkopi Substation in central Arizona. All three lines terminate at the Eldorado substation, which is connected to the nearby McCullough and Marketplace substations via Path 62. McCullough - Victorville lines 1 and 2 (LADW&P;) Both McCullough - Victorville 500kv power lines are maintained by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADW&P;) and leave the Victorville substation heading northeast along with the Hoover - Victorville 287 kV line. The Intermountain 500 kV DC power line also joins the group of three power lines a short distance later. After crossing the Interstate 15 for the first time north of the Dale Evens Parkway interchange, the lines turn and head in a more easterly direction to avoid the Barstow area. The lines then cross the Interstate 40 just east of Dagget for their only time and then cross over Interstate 15 again. The set of four power lines generally parallels Interstate 15 at a distance to the north of the highway for the rest of the path in California. The Marketplace - Adelanto 500 kV power line joins the group of four power lines north of Newberry Springs for a short distance before it turns away eastward and follows Interstate 15 closely instead. After the lines pass Clark Mountain to the north, they enter Nevada adjacent to Primm and Interstate 15. At Primm the group of power lines, along with the Marketplace - Adelanto line which has come back, split and spread out across the desert, with lines spanning over each other. After crossing some mountains, the McCullough - Victorville and the Hoover - Victorville 287 kV lines reunite and terminate at the McCullough substation, while several other lines bypass the substation and terminate in other locations, such as the Intermountain line. Marketplace - Adelanto (LADW&P;) The Marketplace - Adelanto line originates at the Adelanto substation west of the Victorville substation. This same substation is also the southern terminus of the Intermountain HVDC line at the Adelanto Converter Station. As the line leaves the substation, it heads north and parallel with the U.S. Route 395 for a while before turning east at Kramer Junction and then northeast near Fort Irwin before meeting the Marketplace - Victorville lines near Newberry Springs. The line then runs adjacent to the other Marketplace - Victorville lines for a short distance before it crossing over them and heading towards the Interstate 15 where it follows the highway closely until reaching the Ivanpah Valley. The line crosses the freeway again just prior to the Nevada State Line and enters Nevada to the southeast of Primm where it then turns northward and rejoins with the other Path 46 line northeast of the community and continues northeast on the way to the Marketplace substation. Capacity and source of the electricity The entire Path 46 system has a capacity of transmitting 10,623 megawatts (about 10 gigawatts) from east to west. It has no rating to transfer power from west to east and historically this never happens. It sends electric power to the cities of Southern California such as San Diego, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Santa Ana, Temecula, Riverside and Bakersfield.NEAC Strategic Transmission Discussion. Western states map, page 4-6 and 4-9 The sources of electricity are from hydroelectric dams (like Hoover Dam) on the Colorado River, fossil fuel plants (like the Chuck Lenzie Generating Station in North Las Vegas, Nevada), nuclear energy (like the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant), and more recently, utility-scale solar plants (such as the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility and the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm). Expansion= Devers - Palo Verde No. 2  A new 500 kV line called Devers - Palo Verde No. 2 (DPV 2) proposed by Southern California Edison (SCE) was approved by both the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) in the years 2007 and 2005, respectively. The new 500 kV line will follow the existing Devers - Palo Verde - 500 kV from Devers substation in the San Gorgonio Pass pass near Palm Springs in California to the Harquahala Generating Station (near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station) in Arizona and will cost $680 million to build. The new line and associated upgrades to the regional transmission system will bring an additional 1,200 MW of electrical power to the Greater Los Angeles area, which is enough to power 780,000 homes. In June 2007, the Arizona Corporation Commission rejected SCE's application for the line expansion. SCE then appealed to the FERC, and is currently working directly with ACC to find a solution. Construction on the California portion of the line could begin in 2009, but Arizona is not expected to respond before the end of 2009. In 2011, Southern California Edison began construction on a second line anyway between their Valley Substation in Romoland, CA and the new Colorado River Substation near the Chuckawalla Valley State Prison, west of Blythe, which went into service in 2013. This has some use since 750MW of renewable energy generating capacity was being added in the region.http://regarchive.sdge.com/sunrisepowerlink/docs/srpl_whitepaper.pdfhttp://regarchive.sdge.com/sunrisepowerlink/renewable.html A second line continuing into Arizona was not included in Arizona Public Service's most recent (2014) plan, which covers planning up to 2023. Both Devers - Palo Verde 500kV lines are now split into 5 different sections. Devers - Red Bluff 500kV lines #1 and #2, Colorado River - Red Bluff 500 kV lines #1 and #2, and the Colorado River - Palo Verde 500kV line. The Colorado River and Red Bluff substations facilitate different solar projects in the area and allow the opportunity to transmit into each station at 230kV (known as 220kV within Southern California Edison) or lower voltages and step up to the 500kV system. There are Series Capacitor stations between Devers and Red Bluff (known as \\"Cal Caps\\") and in between Colorado River and Palo Verde (known as AZ Caps). SDG&E; San Diego Gas & Electric has also proposed a new 500 kV power line, with its eastern terminus at the North Gila substation and several possibilities for the western terminus and route configuration. Incidents=Wildfires of October 2007 On October 21, 2007 the Harris Fire, part of the California wildfires of October 2007, damaged and disabled an extension of the North Gila-Imperial Valley 500 kV line that heads into San Diego. Power outage of September 2011 The 2011 Southwestern United States blackout that began on September 8, was a widespread power outage which affected parts of western Arizona, northern Baja California, and Southern California. A mistake by an Arizona Public Service employee at the North Gila substation resulted in the loss of a 500 kV line supplying San Diego Gas & Electric's North Gila-Imperial Valley segment on the Southwest Power Link causing one of the largest power outages in history for the Southern California region. Had the utilities affected realized the consequences to the loss of this line, they would have taken steps to eliminate the vulnerability. On April 27, 2012, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation released their report detailing the blackout and its causes. Most of the areas affected were served by San Diego Gas & Electric Company, and left more than 5 million people without power.

(commonly known as SOG) is an American knife and tool manufacturing company famous for their reproduction SOG Knife from the Vietnam era.Pacella, Gerard (2002), 100 Legendary Knives, Iola, USA, Krause Publications, 145. SOG manufactures a variety of knives other than the original military inspired designs, many designed for everyday carry (EDC). The company also produces its own line of multi-tools. History The company was founded in 1986 by Spencer and Gloria Frazer and was inspired in its choice of name by the Joint Services Special Operations unit known as the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG) who developed their own knife during the War in Vietnam. SOG Bowie Changes were made to the original design of the MACV SOG Fighter, like resin- impregnating the leather handle, utilizing thicker stock and new grind lines, Spencer and Gloria launched their product and company with a one-page, black and white ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine for the S1 Bowie, a replica of the SOG Knife used by the SOG groups operating in South-East Asia. They also produced the SCUBA/Demo knife, which is a replica of one of the rarest military knives to date (only 1 of the original 39 knives produced has survived till this day). Author Greg Walker considers knives such as these and many of the SOG models produced prior to the shift of production from Seki City, Japan to Taiwan to be the best knives SOG had ever made. A second \\"maritime\\" version of the Bowie (S2) was made utilizing a black micarta handle and stainless steel blade known as the Trident. It was decorated with the US Navy SEAL emblem as opposed to the Special Forces Crest found on the Bowie. The original S1 and S2 classic bowies were manufactured for SOG by Ichiro Hattori of Seki Japan until 2006. The other models were manufactured by Kinryu Corp. also of Seki until 2007. SEAL 2000 Seal Pup Elite made by SOG Knives SOG manufactures a knife used by the United States Navy SEALs dubbed the SEAL 2000. The SOG SEAL 2000 is a 7\\" bladed fixed blade knife with a polymer handle that was designed for the US Navy SEAL knife trials in 1992. The knife was manufactured from 1995 to 2007 for SOG by Kinryu of Seki Japan. Both the Seal 2000 and the smaller version, the Seal Pup are on display in the knife exhibit at the US Navy SEAL Museum in Ft.Pierce, Florida. Two SOG \\"Seal 2000\\" knives were used in the 2001 Dartmouth College murders. Scabbards left at the scene were crucial in tracing the killers.  Multitools, folding knives and modern fixed-blade knives  The SOG paratool functions as a pair of pliers and contains fold-out blades and other tools. SOG Specialty Knives manufactures an array of tools available for military personnel and casual outdoor users. SOG also makes several other military style knives including a tactical switchblade which is only available to military/law enforcement personnel. SOG has developed fixed blade knives for survival and outdoors such as the Tech Bowie as well as folding knives, many of which feature assisted opening technology such as the Aegis, Twitch and Trident. SOG also manufactures multi- tools including the Paratool, PowerLock, and PowerAssist. Many of SOG's folding knives and multi-tools are made or assembled in the United States, with the higher priced folders being made by G.Sakai in Seki City. The fixed blade models that were originally made in Seki are now made in Taiwan. Some of SOG's lesser priced tools, such as the Fusion line are manufactured in Taiwan or China.

The Ambon or Ambo (, meaning \\"step\\" or \\"elevate\\" Slavonic: amv√≥n) is a projection coming out from the soleas (the walkway in front of the iconostasis) in an Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic church. The ambon stands directly in front of the Holy Doors.\\"Gospel in the Liturgy\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia It may be either rounded or square and has one, two, or three steps leading up to it. History Originally, the Ambon was an elevated platform, somewhat variable in location within the church, where the scriptures were read during the Divine Liturgy. It is still so used for celebrations of the Liturgy of St James. It is a development from the bimah in the Jewish synagogue. In the Russian Orthodox Church, during Hierarchical services, the bishop will stand upon a raised platform (kafedra) in the center of the nave like the bimah of old. Originally used in both the East and West, the structure has almost disappeared in the Western Rites. In early Western churches it was known also as the Gradus, lectorium, or lectricium, and from it has developed the lectern or pulpit, and took the form of a raised stand for preaching and often readings, approached by steps. In the West, there were often two ambons, one on the north (for the reading or chanting of the Gospel) and one on the south (for the Epistle) side of the choir or presbytery.\\"Ambo\\" definition, Answers.com. Remnants of the ambo may be found at the Basilica of St Clement in Rome and St Mark's Basilica in Venice. In the Roman Catholic Church the stand from which the Gospel is read is formally called the ambo (not ambon). It is normally in the form of a lectern or pulpit, and located near the front of the chancel. Usage Ancient Ambon outside Hagia Sophia in (Istanbul, Turkey) The ambon is the platform from which the deacon reads the Gospel and says the litanies, and the priest gives the dismissal during the Divine Services. The ambon is considered to be a part of the altar (i.e., the sanctuary), so normally only the clergy will go up onto the ambon. The exception is that the faithful will step up onto the ambon when they come forward to receive Holy Communion. During the Rite of the Churching of Women, the newborn infant is taken by the priest up onto the ambon (provided the child has been baptized by this time‚Äîotherwise, this ceremony will wait until after the baptism). If the child is female, the priest lays her in front of the icon of the Theotokos; if it is a male, the priest takes the child around the Holy Table (altar). In some Greek Orthodox parishes, there is an ambo to the side (usually the Liturgical North, opposite the Bishop's throne) of the Iconostasis. It retains only a few of the functions of the ancient ambo, whereas the solea retains the other functions. The Epistle and Homily are read from this ambon (similar to a western pulpit), whereas the Gospel is read from the Solea. The practice of vesting the Bishop in the center of the nave is retained in parishes without chairs or pews. If the parish has chairs and pews, then the vesting of the Bishop occurs near the iconostasis, sometimes on the solea/ambon itself. The last public prayer of the Divine Liturgy is the \\"Prayer Before the Ambon\\" (Greek: euche opisthambonos), originally a prayer of thanksgiving said as the clergy descended the ambon at the end of the service. In ancient times, there was a large collection of Prayers Before the Ambon, written for the different Feast Days of the church year and for those occasional services (Weddings, Funerals, etc.) that called for a celebration of the Divine Liturgy. In some Orthodox Churches this more extensive collection of prayers is used.

The name is a reference to Percy Shelley's famous sonnet Ozymandias, which forms part of the introduction. The series was illustrated by Mister X creator Dean Motter and co-written with Mark Askwith. It was later collected as a 208-page trade paperback, with the addition of a new prologue.DC Comics Site Overview Set twenty years after the final episode of the television series, Shattered Visage follows former secret agent Alice Drake as she is shipwrecked on the shores of the Village and encounters an aged Number Six. While the decades-old conflict unfolds between Six and Number Two (as played by Leo McKern in the TV series), secret agents in London have their own plans regarding the intelligence mine that is The Village, as well as the secret lying at its very core. The trade paperback included a two-page text piece that explained the surreal final episode, \\"Fall Out\\" as drug-induced hallucination. The likenesses of McGoohan and Leo McKern were featured for their characters‚Äô returns. ITC Entertainment subjected the comic to a thorough evaluation. The contract required that each page of art and each complete issue be sent to the notoriously critical series creator, Patrick McGoohan, for his signed approval. McGoohan signed off on the material without comment and ITC later informed Motter, \\"He didn't hate it.\\" McKern sent Motter a note saying he was flattered to be a \\"comic book villain\\" for the first time.Mister M: A Career Retrospective with Dean Motter Plot synopsis Former secret agent Alice Drake, now an adventurer, prepares to embark upon a round-the- world sailing expedition. Her daughter, Meagan, is left in the care of her estranged husband Thomas, a secret service officer. Thomas is conducting research on the Village, a retirement facility for British spies that, in 1967, became focused on interrogating Number Six to determine the extent of his secret information and intent. Their final, unsuccessful effort was a surreal, drug-enhanced psychodrama in which Number Two (Leo McKern) staged his own death and resurrection. Shortly afterwards, the Village was evacuated by UN troops, but Six was not among the inmates released and his whereabouts remain unknown. Two was jailed for violating the Official Secrets Act and, while in prison, wrote a tell-all book about the Village which Thomas personally altered to redact classified information. With Two's twenty-year sentence ending, Thomas fears that he will return to the Village and will do something that will expose British covert operations. Meanwhile, Alice runs into a storm and finds herself shipwrecked on the island where the Village is located. Seeking help, Alice explores the Village and enters Two's house, where she finds a giant domed room. In the oval-shaped center chair sits a bearded man who tells her where she is and that she is Number Six. This man is the former, original Six. rightAlice spends the night in Six's living quarters in the Village. The next morning, Six takes Alice on a tour. He says that the other Villagers were \\"free to go\\" while he was \\"free to stay.\\" While Six is mysterious and distant, Alice finds him kind as he catches fish and makes them dinner. Later that night, Alice wanders away and is captured by Rover, which brings her back to meet the newly returned Number Two. Two claims that he has returned to help Six escape, describing him as a valuable and powerful man unjustly punished and driven mad for actions performed on behalf of his country. Alice is appalled at Two's glee and leaves angrily. Back in London, Thomas and his partner, an American agent named Lee West, prepare a private expedition to the Village. Despite the lack of official resources from Thomas' superiors, the two men are convinced that the Village is at the center of someone's manipulations, as a number of people formerly tied to the Village have been assassinated. Meanwhile, Six and Alice are confronted by Two. Six, having been isolated from the modern technology in Alice's possession, voices his suspicions that Two sent her as a scout. Two and Six engage in a fistfight. Their battle takes them inside an old mill where Two gains the upper hand. As Two chokes Six, both fall out a window into the water below. Afterwards, Six enters his residence and begins to cut his beard. Thomas and Lee bring a small handful of associates to the Village, while a group of soldiers sent by Thomas's superior, Director Ross of Operations, also arrive; the motives of both parties are unclear. Entering the dome room, Lee triggers the lift below the center chair, lowering them into the underground chambers. There they are met by Two, who claims that Six is dead. Lee and Thomas also discover several nuclear missiles. As Lee admonishes Thomas for not recognizing the true purpose of the Village, Two triggers the nukes without opening the silo doors. The Village is destroyed in a massive explosion, supposedly killing all who remain. Beyond the reach of the flames, however, Alice's boat, repaired with a Village waterwheel, is seen sailing away. Back in London, Ross receives a report that indicates all the assassinations have one man in common: a mysterious, top-hatted man with a mustache. Ross takes the report to his superior, the Colonel, who has been replaced by the same mustached man. The report is burnt and his resignation demanded. Later that night, Ross is gassed unconscious in his home, loaded into a hearse by two men, and transported to whereabouts unknown, echoing Six's own abduction at the start of the TV series. At a park, Six assures Alice that his secrets are safe and bids her farewell with the Village salute, saying, \\"Be seeing you.\\" The scene is shown on a video monitor in a control room similar to Two's office, located in the Palace of Westminster.  Reception  Shattered Visage received mixed reviews from fans and critics. Howard Foy of The Unmutual fan site called the comic \\"a major disappointment\\" due to its contradictions with the series finale and wrote that \\"surely any sequel to The Prisoner must take as its starting point the closing moments of 'Fall Out.'\\" Foy was particularly displeased by Numbers Six and Two being at odds when \\"Fall Out\\" had ended with them apparently friends, writing, \\"Their return to the Village and their sworn enmity a la \\"Once Upon A Time\\" is a concept that is deeply unsatisfying and one that this reader found almost impossible to accept.\\" The Anorak Zone review also expressed distaste for the comic's \\"revisionist history,\\" asking, \\"If you don't like the source, then why write a sequel to it? Also worrying is that anally retentive need to echo the dialogue of the series, and it doesn't feel particularly original.\\" The content was also described as \\"not exactly dense\\" with \\"over 50 of its 187 pages having no dialogue.\\" Blogger Gordon Dymowski described Dean Motter's artwork as \\"unreadable and needlessly abstract\\" but expressed high regard for Motter and Mark Askwith's writing, calling it \\"superb, drawing disparate elements in a story that often feels like episodes 18 - 22 of the original series.\\" He spoke well of the comic's interpretation of the series finale, saying that \\"the most clever part of Shattered Visage is how it integrates the sloppiness of 'Fall Out' into its story and allows Number Six to truly become a prisoner.\\" Art critic Fr√©d√©rik Sisa, also writing on The Unmutual, found that Shattered Visage demonstrated \\"faithfulness to the characters, an understanding and elaboration of key themes, and a connection to the original series‚Äô essential philosophical core.\\" Sisa disagreed with other reviewers asserting that Shattered Visage depicts a defeated Number Six, writing, \\"Altogether, what we find in Shattered Visage‚Äôs Number Six are the same character traits as in the original series. If he was indeed broken by Degree Absolute, we find no clear sign of it in his behaviour or personality. Someone did break, however, and the case is strong that it was Number Two who fell to pieces.\\" Sisa notes that Thomas Drake's files indicate Six never gave up any secrets and this combined with Number Two's irrational and suicidal actions make Two's account and sanity suspect. Sisa viewed Number Six's presence in the Village as appropriate for a character who was \\"a lone wolf, a man who wanted time to think\\" and found that the comic addressed \\"Fall Out\\" in a respectful fashion, saying, \\"As controversial as it was for Motter and Askwith to revise 'Fall Out' as a hallucinogenic theatrical interrogation, the maneuver makes sense in terms of The Prisoner‚Äòs literal story of a resigned government agent.\\" Sisa wrote that the comic remains in line with the sentiments of \\"Fall Out\\" as Shattered Visage \\"reinforces the view that while the individual may not break and may even triumph over himself, he or she will always be in tension with society.\\"  See also  *List of comics based on television programs References Category:The Prisoner Category:DC Comics limited series Category:Comics based on television series Category:1988 comics debuts Category:Spy comics ","title":"Shattered Visage"},{"id":"10415074","text":"The South African Planning Institute was formed on 1 July 1996 following the amalgamation of the South African Institute of Town and Regional Planners and the Development Planning Association of South Africa.South African Planning Institute Website Its purpose is: :\\"to enhance the art and science of sustainable local, regional and national human and physical development planning, and the theory and practise relating thereto.\\" The South African Planning Institute has regional branches in Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Freestate, Mpumalanga, Kwazulu-Natal, North West, Western Cape, Northern Cape and Limpopo.

The species now also occurs in the Mediterranean, having colonized it as part of Lessepsian migration through the Suez Canal. Fish of this family are characterized by their flat bodies, forked tail fins, and long pectoral fins. Silver pomfrets are usually silver/white in color, with few small scales. They can grow up to a range of 4‚Äì6 kg (8‚Äì13 lb). However, due to overfishing, specimens weighing less than 1 kg (2 lb) are more commonly seen. The silver pompano should not be mistaken for the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus), which is a jackfish found off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, and neither should be confused with true pomfrets, which are of the family Bramidae.  As food  This fish is prized in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region for its taste. Its flesh is soft and buttery when cooked. It is called pamplet or Maanji in Mumbai and vawall in parts of South India. It is called zubaidi in Arabic, which is derived from the word zubdah, which means butter, due to its tender flesh. In Malaysia it is known as bawal putih.

A.) Odhiambo, MBBS, MMed (Surg), FRCS (Edin), FCS (ECSA), FACC, is a Kenyan consultant thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon. He is Kenya's first cardio-thoracic surgeon and a professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the University of Nairobi. He is a founder and former chairman of the Kenya Cardiac Society, and a former president of the Pan African Society of Cardiology (PASCAR). Odhiambo is the chairman of the Kenya Tobacco Control Board. He is also the founder and editor of Medicom, the African Journal of Hospital Medicine. In 1986, Odhiambo was given an award for an outstanding contribution in medicine by the Giant Federation of Kenya, and in 1993 he received another award from PASCAR for his distinguished service to cardiology in Africa. He was the tenth dean of Nairobi University's Faculty, now School of Medicine, serving from 1992 to 1996. During his tenure, he successfully steered the faculty towards cost-sharing through its most difficult period for both staff and students. In 2012, he was given the Mater Hospital Recognition Award, followed, in 2013, by the SSK award for Outstanding Role in Medical Education and Teaching. He conceptualized and then chaired the University of Nairobi Teaching Hospital Project. He has written two books: Tobacco Versus Health and Making Sense of Cessation of Tobacco. Odhiambo has campaigned widely against drug abuse and is at the forefront in the fight for the liberation of tobacco farmers in East Africa. He has steered the Kenya Tobacco Control Board to a successful level enabling the board be legally institutionalized. He has also played a key role in ensuring that the legal mandate of the board is within the laid down legal framework as per the Tobacco Control Act of 2007, thus the Board has all the necessary instruments to operate legally. In 2008, Odhiambo won an award from the World Health Organization for his accomplishments in the area of tobacco control. In 2016 he won the WHO World No-Tobacco Day Award to Board I Chair. He worked tirelessly behind the scenes to create awareness on the dangers of shisha (hookah), and was instrumental in the Kenya government's decision to ban shisha in the country. He is involved in many community projects in his home village of Kanyaluo, found in Rachuonyo District in Western Kenya's Homa Bay County. He is a founder member and chairman of the Karachuonyo Development Society. In 1998, Odhiambo's son, James Ocholla Odhiambo \\"Jordan\\", was gunned down by Kenyan policemen, for no cause, on his way home from the Nairobi Campus of the United States International University, where he was a student. The tragedy, which exposed corruption in the Kenya Police at that time, received wide media coverage and was a major source of motivation for Odhiambo's interest in, and consequent campaigns toward, the efficiency and effectiveness of the Kenya Police. Odhiambo was educated at the Calcutta Medical College, Nairobi University, the University of Edinburgh and McGill University. He resides in Nairobi with his family.

Portrait by Louis Carrogis dit Carmontelle, 1761. Chantilly, Mus√©e Cond√©. Bernard-Joseph Saurin (1706 in Paris - 17 November 1781 in Paris) was a lawyer, poet, and playwright. Biography Saurin was the son of Joseph Saurin, a converted Protestant minister and mathematician who had been accused in 1712 by Jean-Baptiste Rousseau of being the actual author of defamatory verses that gossip had attributed to Rousseau.Rousseau was prosecuted for defamation of character and condemned to perpetual exile. Attracted to literature, and frequenting the Society of the Caveau, he became a lawyer at Parliament, a career which he did not like, but endured for fifteen years in order to support his family. His professional life in the theatre began when he was forty. Neither his comedy Les Trois rivaux (The Three Rivals), nor his tragedy Am√©nophis met with success, which came in 1760 with the tragedy Spartacus and the comedy Les M≈ìurs du temps (The Manners of the Time), which were applauded at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. In the following year, the author was elected a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He attended the literary cafes and the salons of Madame de Sta√´l, Mme de Tencin, Madame Geoffrin and Madame d'√âpinay. Friend of Voltaire, Saint-Lambert, Montesquieu, Turgot and Helv√©tius, he could be regarded as one of the philosophers. He translated some English works into French, and saw some of his works translated in turn into English. Among the better known of his plays was B√©verlei (1768), a tragedy.

Predominantly a boarding school, but with some day boys, it was founded in Honiton about 1515, moved to a new home at Rousdon in the 1930s, and was closed in 1998, after a fall in the number of boys had led to a financial crisis. Although Lyme Regis is in Dorset, the new school site was over the county boundary in Devon. However, the postal address was \\"Near Lyme Regis, Dorset\\", which has led to confusion. History The school was founded about 1515 in Honiton, probably as a chantry school where priests taught boys to read Latin so that they could sing in the choir. Later still it became a grammar school for the sons of the local gentry. Its origins in Honiton are the reason former pupils are still known as Old Honitonians, or OHs. The school was named after its neighbour All Hallows, a roadside chapel for travellers built sometime before 1327 and now the oldest existing secular building in Honiton. By the 1930s there was an increase in traffic through Honiton, which lay on the main route to Cornwall, which became a serious hazard to the school, with premises on both sides of the main road. The headmaster of the day, George Shallow, found a new site in the shape of a large Victorian country house with over 350 acres of land on the coast at Rousdon, a few miles to the West of Lyme Regis. This stood on the cliffs of what was later called the Jurassic Coast, now a World Heritage Site. The house had been built in the 1870s for Sir Henry Peek, 1st Baronet, by the architect Sir Ernest George, who also built Southwark Bridge in London. (Among Sir Ernest's pupils was the even more famous architect Sir Edwin Lutyens). In 1870 Sir Henry purchased the village of Rousdon, rebuilt the church and built the village school. He then commissioned Ernest George to design a mansion to take advantage of the superb position 152.4m/500 feet above the sea. Being a distance from the nearest town, the house had to be self-sufficient with laundry, coach houses, harness rooms, wine cellars, bowling alley, rifle range, china stores, bake houses, larders, museum, observatory, walled garden, tennis courts, farm buildings and numerous cottages to house the estate population, which at the end of the 19th Century extended to about 600. Sir Henry Peek was a governor of Holloway prison, and many of the floors were inlaid with mosaics created by the inmates. Sir Henry's famous collection of stuffed birds reputedly had an example of every bird to have landed on the British Isles. The building was a few hundred yards from the cliff-edge overlooking the massive landslip from 1839 and had extensive grounds, even if the location was remote. Inevitably not all the necessary facilities were there and though improvement work started this was brought to a halt by the Second World War. The school was not to acquire a proper gymnasium, swimming pool or cricket pavilion until some years after the war. In the two decades after the Second World War the school gained a national reputation in shooting, attending Bisley on a regular basis and winning the inter-schools Ashburton trophy several times. This was thanks to the work of James Turner who had been a pupil at the school and then after university joined the staff as chemistry master. During the war he had worked on ballistics and he used this knowledge to train a series of first-class shots. He stayed with the school all his life, ending up with a short spell in the headmaster's chair, and then in retirement raising funds. He was one of several masters who devoted their lives to the school including G. S. Napier ('Nap') who spent over a hundred terms there after the First World War. Around 1970 the school became one of the first public schools to admit girls and it prospered into the 1980s. However, in the 1990s it went into a decline, with the number of pupils decreasing significantly, from almost 300 to fewer than half that number. One reason for this may have been the school's remote location, at a time when parents expected to see a lot more of their children than had been traditional in the old public school era. Closure The school ran into financial difficulty in 1994. A group of Old Honitonians put together a plan and secured some financial backing to attempt a rescue. A new entity, Allhallows College was established as a company limited by guarantee and registered as a charity. The recession of the early 1990s proved severe, and several West Country schools were closed; the same fate befell Allhallows College despite efforts of staff and board of directors. The college was closed in 1998. There is continuing controversy among Old Honitonians as to whether the closure was the best decision for the school or necessary.

Resor is credited as the first woman in American history to design and implement national advertising campaigns (source). She was named #14 on the list of 100 Advertising people of the 20th Century by Advertising Age.  Career  1916 Ladies' Home Journal ad One of several children raised by a single mother who worked as a librarian and real estate agent, Lansdowne Resor followed her mother's example and entered the workforce after her graduation from high school in 1903. After working at a local manufacturer in her hometown of Covington, Kentucky, Lansdowne Resor gained her first advertising experience as a bill auditor for Procter & Collier in the nearby hub of Cincinnati, Ohio. She then moved on to her first creative position, writing retail advertisements for the Commercial Tribune, a Cincinnati-based newspaper. In 1906, Lansdowne Resor became a copywriter at Street Railways Advertising Co. Following her creative success in these positions, in 1907, Stanley Resor of Procter & Collier invited her to return to the agency as a copywriter, where she worked on campaigns for clients such as Red Cross shoes. In 1908, Lansdowne Resor became the first female copywriter at J. Walter Thompson Co.. Only three years later, she was promoted and moved to the agency's New York office, where she helped create the first campaign for Crisco vegetable shortening. In 1916, Stanley Resor bought J. Walter Thompson Co. and became its president. While Stanley managed account service, Helen was responsible for the creative side of advertisement production. One year later, the couple married, solidifying them as a prominent pair in the industry. Lansdowne Resor eventually became a Vice President and director at the agency, where she was active until 1958 after suffering a fall in the office. Both she and Stanley Resor were posthumously inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame for their achievements in 1967.  Industry Contributions  In her decades of service to the advertising industry, Lansdowne Resor is credited with a number of contributions which were pivotal in shaping the industry as a whole. As the first woman to both plan and develop national advertising campaigns, she became a conduit through which many women were able to enter the male- dominated field of advertising. Lansdowne Resor actively mentored young women, creating a women's editorial department within J. Walter Thompson Co. where women were encouraged to speak their minds. These policies established the agency as a female-friendly organization that challenged its competitors to follow in its example. Her dedication to truthfully presenting the feminine experience is realized in her belief that \\"copy must be believable,\\" which thus encouraged her to foster the inclusion of more women into the advertising field. Lansdowne Resor was also deeply involved in the New York suffrage movement. Following President Wilson's ratification of the 19th Amendment, she and her female employees marched in the consequent celebration parade. During the Great Depression, as president of the Traveler's Aid Society, she helped provide shelter to homeless women and their families. Shortly after, during World War II, Lansdowne Resor and her creative team were responsible for the development and execution of a campaign entitled \\"Women must work to win the war,\\" which resulted in three million women entering the workforce by 1943. Moreover, Lansdowne Resor is well known for her contribution to the utilization of sex appeals in advertising through her 1911 print advertisement for the Woodbury Soap Company. The ad, which features a woman with a fair complexion being touched by a man, was accompanied by a headline which read, \\"A skin you love to touch.\\" The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. The body copy presented Woodbury Soap as a product which would beautify skin and foster charm. In addition to its utilization of sex appeal, the advertisement is also a prime example of Lansdowne Resor's innovative \\"feature story\\" writing style, in which advertisement copy came to closely resemble the editorial copy of the magazines in which the ads were placed, taking advantage of visual and textual appeals which related to the audience's emotions. Advertising executive Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on Advertising Age's list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.See \\"Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886-1964)\\" in Advertising Age Sept 15, 2003 See also *Snake River Ranch, Resor's Wyoming vacation home on the National Register of Historic Places. *Their son, Stanley R.

For approximately 40 years the SAITRP was the only professional association of national significance in South Africa. Its position of prominence began to crumble in the 1990s, and this decline coincided with the anti-apartheid revolution in that country. The institute was perceived by some to harbour apartheid prejudice. The Development Planning Association of South Africa (DPASA) was founded in January 1994 by younger planners who criticised the lack of action on the part of the SAITRP in promoting transformation of both South African society.

It aired at both MBS and TBS from October 21, 1983 to September 8, 1984. Plot In the far-flung future of 2058, hostile alien forces (collectively known as the \\"Astrogaters\\") attack the human colony at Clayad, the third planet of the Ypserlon system, which is located 43 light years away from Earth. Because of this, the colonists on Clayad are evacuated from the planet by the human military. During the confusion, some of the human children become stranded from their parents and escape in the training combat space ship, the Janous. With the help of the ship's defense systems, they manage to arrive at Belwick, the fourth planet of the system, where other humans supposedly live. However, upon arriving they discover that the colony at Belwick had already been destroyed by the enemies too. Learning to pilot the VIFAMs and other mecha, the 13 children decide to escape to Earth by themselves. On their way to Earth, they discover a damaged alien ship piloted by a friendly Astrogater. From him they learn that one of the children is actually an alien as well; their parents have been captured and taken to the Astrogater home planet Kukto's artificial satellite, Tuat. After numerous battles with Astrogaters (or Kuktonians as they call themselves), and receiving some help from Earth military forces, they manage to reach Tuat. One of the children is captured and taken prisoner on Tuat where he learns that there is a rebel faction among the Kuktonians and effects an escape with the help of the imprisoned rebels. After liberating the alien prisoners, the children learn that their parents have been moved planet side to Kukto, where they make an attempt to rescue them.

It included mechanical designs by artists Kunio Okawara (who previously designed mecha for the Mobile Suit Gundam anime series) and Mamoru Nagano, as well as character designs by the late Toyoo Ashida (famous for his work in Magical Princess Minky Momo). The show's intro theme, \\"Hello Vifam\\", was composed and sung by Japanese artist David Mann, with lyrics by Jeanette Mann, and performed by the progressive rock band TAO. This theme is one of the first Japanese anime title songs written entirely with English language lyrics. Galactic Drifter Vifam premiered in Japan on Japan News Network's television stations (including MBS and TBS) between October 21, 1983 and September 8, 1984. A remake of the series, , aired on MBS and its affiliated networks between March 21, 1998 and October 3, 1998. The first series was also later re-run in Japan on Animax on December 23, 2006. Video game There was a video game adaptation, also entitled Ginga Hyoryuu Vifam, released by Bandai for the MSX computer platform in 1984. It was an action game and space combat simulator that uses 3D wire- frame graphics. The game allowed the player to explore open space while switching between three monitors, each one displaying a different perspective. The first monitor displays a top-down perspective used mainly for navigation, the second monitor displays a first-person perspective which can be used to explore through space or engage enemies in first-person shooter combat, and the third monitor is used for servicing the player's mecha. The game also implemented an early physics engine where approaching a planet's gravitational field pulls the player towards it; if the player gets caught in a gravity field, they must accelerate out of the gravity field in a close-up view. The game also uses a radar that displays the relative positions of the player and enemies as well as the destination.

Spelling tests are usually given in school during language arts class, to see how well each student has learned the most recent spelling lesson. Typical intervals for spelling tests are one per week throughout the school year, except for spelling bees, which are generally held once per year.  Types of spelling tests  There are generally four types of spelling tests. In an oral spelling test, the teacher pronounces each word out loud and the students write each word down. In a spelling bee-type test (see spelling bee below), each student is asked individually one-at-a-time to spell a (different) specific word out loud. In a proofreading-style test, sentences or paragraphs are given to the student on one or more sheets of paper, and the student must find the incorrectly spelled words and supply the correct spellings in the spaces provided. In a multiple choice spelling test, two or more spellings are given for each word in the test, and the student must place a mark next to the one that is correct. The main difference between most spelling tests at school and a spelling bee is that in a spelling bee the students do not get to know in advance which words will be tested, but for regular spelling tests they do.  Spelling bee  One very difficult kind of spelling test is the spelling bee: a competition where contestants, usually children, are asked to spell English words. The practice originated in the United States and has since spread to elsewhere in the English-speaking world, especially North America. It is not, however, a very familiar concept in the most Commonwealth nations, where, if the term is known at all, it is usually perceived as a peculiar American tradition. Every year in the United States, there is a national spelling bee involving most primary and secondary schools in the country; in addition to being awarded a scholarship, the winners in each age group get to meet the President of the United States.  Preparing for a spelling test  WRAT pre- and post-test results for experimental and control groups  Repetition  In this method, the student typically writes out each word in the current spelling lesson a set number of times each, for example, 50 to 100 times.  Making mnemonics  One of the most effective ways to memorize spellings is to make up mnemonics to help remember them. A mnemonic is a memory trick which associates the thing that is to be remembered with something else to make it easier. For spelling, it can be the exaggerated pronunciation of a word, like indepenDENT. Or it might be a silly sentence or visual image to help remember the word, like \\"the independents all dented their cars with sledgehammers\\". Or it might describe a key aspect of a word to help remember it, like \\"all the vowels in cemetery are the same: three little e's, each on its own little tombstone.\\" See also *Common European Framework of Reference for Languages *WRAT External links ;Free online spelling tests * Free Word Cup vocabulary/spelling quiz, updated weekly with 30 new words ;Another online spelling tests * Spell Words, Numbers, Cities, Phone numbers and letters!

The functional attains stationary value equal to actual scattering T-matrix. The functional is stationary if and only if the two functions satisfy the Lippmann-Schwinger equation.

It consists of quilted nylon with a polyester filling. It is attached to the poncho by means of integral lengths of material which are looped through the poncho's eyelets. Poncho liners were first used by the U.S. military in the Vietnam War. They gained the nickname \\"woobie\\" later; that term is conjectured to have derived from the name for a child's security blanket in the 1983 movie Mr. Mom.  Construction and history  Although it is unclear how this item originated, it was first fielded around 1962 to special forces troops in Vietnam. The poncho liner consists of two layers of quilted nylon encasing a polyester batting. There were tie-cords on the corners and side that could be tied through matching grommets on rain ponchos. They measured 62 x 82 inches. The intent was to field an item which was lighter and faster drying than the standard-issue Army Wool Blanket, which had essentially been rendered obsolete in the wet and tropical environment of Vietnam. The first ones were Olive Drab on both sides and the earliest models featured squared corners. Around 1963, a second model was fielded which was made of WWII duck-hunter patterned parachute fabric. This model required the standard \\"center seam\\" because the fabric wasn't wide enough to produce the entire width. Later, the first camouflaged pattern was produced which was named, \\"ERDL Pattern.\\" This stood for Engineer Research and Development Laboratories and the acronym became the common name for the pattern, which was enlarged somewhat in the 1980s to become the Woodland Pattern used on the BDU uniform and late 1980s poncho liners. The center seam was abandoned in the early 1970s because fabric could be produced in bolts that were wide enough that this sewing pattern was now obsolete. Until the USMC produced their own Digital Woodland Pattern, most poncho liners were produced with the same pattern on both sides. The Marines decided to field one with Woodland Pattern on one side and a solid Coyote Color on the other. There are examples of improved models, which included high-tech 3M fillers (Thinsulate and the like), border and head zippers (there is no hole for one's head on standard issue poncho liners), and a variety of colors and patterns. Brigade Quartermaster, Inc. used to sell a zipper modification kit, which essentially codified and standardized commonly made modifications. Most recently, there have been models produced and issued in the Army's Universal Combat Pattern, the USAF's Environmental Camouflage Pattern, and Multicam/Scorpion II/etc.  Opinions  Opinions among the troops generally hold the poncho liner in high regard, as a very useful piece of equipment, light and packable yet reasonably warm. Even when soaking wet, the poncho liner wrapped around a soldier would trap body heat. Many servicemen and women go through great lengths to find ways to keep their poncho liners as long as possible, even when they leave the service often upcycling or custom tailoring them into smoking jackets, hoodies, blanket coats or robes. The poncho liner found wide acceptance amongst US troops in Vietnam, providing just enough warmth for cool tropical nights but still being light and small. It is especially popular today in the age of 100-pound rucks and bulky Modular Sleep Systems.

It was first published in 1919,Buttel, p. 207 so it is in the public domain. Buttel understands the poem as implementing Stevens's \\"anti-poetic\\" strategy of moving into a poem in an offhand way. He finds that the prose rhythms of the first stanza contrast strikingly with the metrical regularity of the quoted line about the belle undressing. That line is so delicately honest that it almost had to be quoted in order to give the speaker some distance from it. The sturdy epistemic modesty of the first stanza contrasts with the intense opacity of the final stanza. Is it saying that the real tree basks in the illumination of imagination? Is the singer a poet like Walt Whitman, who pushes through what is prosaic (\\"three or four hills and a cloud\\") or beyond his understanding, in order to give full vent to his imagination in, for instance, \\"Song of Myself\\"? See Walt Whitman, \\"Song of Myself\\" Milton Bates speculates that the \\"cloak\\" is probably the cloud and the \\"singer\\" one of the hills.Bates, p. 137 The poem can also be read as one of Stevens's many commentaries on the relation of imagination to reality: the poet's previously written line about the belle undressing (the imagination's formulation) contrasts with the actual scene portrayed in the first part of the poem. To the imagination the color of a tree is easily transformed. The \\"singer\\" in the penultimate line is, by such a reading, the poet who obscures the real world by pulling the cloak of his imagination over his head, enabling him to see the moon in its folds.

It is often featured in religious iconography, theatre and art depicting the ancient history of India. It is a common weapon in Indian martial arts.M. L. K. Murty (2003), p91 Khanda often appears in Hindu, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh scriptures and art. Etymology The word khanda has its origins in the Sanskrit 'Rocky Pendergrass, 2015,Mythological Swords, Page 10. (‡§ñ‡§°‡•ç‡§ó) or ', from a root ' meaning \\"to break, divide, cut, destroy\\". The older word for a bladed weapon, ', is used in the Rigveda in reference to either an early form of the sword or to a sacrificial knife or dagger to be used in war. Appearance The blade broadens from the hilt to the point, which is usually quite blunt. While both edges are sharp, one side usually has a strengthening plate along most of its length, which both adds weight to downward cuts and allows the wielder to place their hand on the plated edge. The hilt has a large plate guard and a wide finger guard connected to the pommel. The pommel is round and flat with a spike projecting from its centre. The spike may be used offensively or as a grip when delivering a two-handed stroke. The hilt is identical to that employed on another South Asian straight sword, the firangi.  History  Early swords appear in the archaeological record of ritual copper swords in Fatehgarh Northern India and Kallur in Southern India. although the Puranas and Vedas give an even older date to the sacrificial knife. Straight swords, (as well as other swords curved both inward and outward), have been used in Indian history since the Iron Age Mahajanapadas (roughly 600 to 300 BC), being mentioned in the Sanskrit epics, and used in soldiers in armies such as those of the Mauryan Empire. Several sculptures from the Gupta era (AD 280-550) portray soldiers holding khanda-like broadswords. These are again flared out at the tip. They continued to be used in art such as Chola-era murtis. There is host of paintings depicting the khanda being worn by Rajput kings throughout the medieval era. It was used usually by foot-soldiers and by nobles who were unhorsed in battle. The Rajput warrior clans venerated the khanda as a weapon of great prestige. Goddess Durga wielding khanda sword, 7th century. According to some, the design was improved by Prithviraj Chauhan. He added a back spine on the blade to add more strength. He also made the blade wider and flatter, making it a formidable cutting weapon. It also gave a good advantage to infantry over light cavalry enemy armies. Rajput warriors in battle wielded the khanda with both hands and swung it over their head when surrounded and outnumbered by the enemy. It was in this manner that they traditionally committed an honourable last stand rather than be captured. Even today they venerate the khanda on the occasion of Dasara. Maharana Pratap is known to have wielded a khanda. The son in law of Miyan Tansen Naubat Khan also wielded khanda and the family was known as Khandara Beenkar. Wazir Khan Khandara was a famous beenkar of 19th century. Many Sikh warriors of the Akali-Nihang order are known to have wielded khandas. For instance, Akali Deep Singh is famous for wielding a khanda in his final battle before reaching his death, which is still preserved at Akaal Takhat Sahib. Akali Phula Singh is also known to have wielded a khanda, and this practise was popular among officers and leaders in the Sikh Khalsa Army as well as by Sikh sardars of the Misls and of the Sikh Empire. The Sikh martial art, Gatka also uses khandas. In Religion In Dharmic religions, Khanda is represented as wisdom cutting through veil of ignorance. Hindu and Buddhist deities are often shown wielding or holding khanda sword in religious art. Notably, Buddhist guardian deities like Arya Achala, Manjushri, Mahakala, Palden Lhamo etc. Gallery File:Manjushri from Rig Sum Gonpo (Lords of the Three Families), view 1, collected by Sven Hedin in 1930, Efi Khalkha temple, Chahar, Inner Mongolia - √ñstasiatiska museet, Stockholm - DSC09304.JPGManjushri wielding Khanda.

Leading Hollywood stars performed adaptations of popular motion pictures. Originating on CBS Radio, it aired under several different titles including The Gulf Screen Guild Show, The Gulf Screen Guild Theater, The Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater and The Camel Screen Guild Players. Fees that would ordinarily have been paid to the stars and studios were instead donated to the Motion Picture Relief Fund, and were used for the construction and maintenance of the Motion Picture Country House. Production The Screen Guild Theater had a long run beginning January 8, 1939, lasting for 14 seasons and 527 episodes. Actors on the series included Ethel Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, Eddie Cantor, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, Bette Davis, Jimmy Durante, Nelson Eddy, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Clark Gable, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Sam Levene, Johnny Mercer, Agnes Moorehead, Dennis Morgan, Gregory Peck, Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, Shirley Temple, and Dinah Shore. The series began with a variety format, with mixed success. The program increasingly came to rely on adaptations of major motion pictures‚Äîpresenting a considerable challenge to writers who had to compress the narrative into 22 minutes. Fees these actors would typically charge were donated to the Motion Picture Relief Fund, in order to support the creation and maintenance of the Motion Picture Country Home for retired actors. A 1940 magazine article noted that The Screen Guild Theater was \\"the only sponsored program on the air which gives all its profits to charity.\\" Nearly $800,000 had been contributed by the summer of 1942. The first three seasons of the CBS series were sponsored by Gulf Oil. With uncertainties in the oil market due to World War II, Gulf dropped the show, and in 1942 the Lady Esther cosmetics corporation assumed sponsorship. The Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater was consistently one of the top ten radio programs. Reverses in the cosmetics industry led Lady Esther to withdraw in 1947, and Camel Cigarettes purchased a three-year contract. Changing time slots and networks brought about a decline in ratings. In the fall of 1950 the series returned to CBS, where it ran until its final broadcast June 30, 1952. The Screen Guild Theater earned a total of $5,235,607 for the Motion Picture Relief Fund. Notable broadcasts \\"A table of highlights would run many pages,\\" wrote radio historian John Dunning, who lists the following notable Screen Guild broadcasts: * The Blue Bird with Shirley Temple and Nelson Eddy (December 24, 1939) * High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart (January 4, 1942) * Sergeant York with Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan (January 19, 1942) * Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney, Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable (October 19, 1942) * Command Decision with Clark Gable, Walter Pidgeon, Van Johnson, John Hodiak, Edward Arnold and Brian Donlevy (March 3, 1949) Shirley Temple's parents declined an offer of $35,000 for her to perform a radio version of The Blue Bird on a commercial broadcast; instead, she presented it on the Screen Guild program without payment. An attempt was made on her life during the show. As Temple was singing \\"Someday You'll Find Your Bluebird\\", a woman in the audience rose from her seat and pulled out a handgun, pointing it directly at her. The woman hesitated and was disarmed. It was later discovered that she had lost a child on the day it was publicly stated that Temple was born, and blamed her for stealing her daughter's soul. The series benefited during its 1950‚Äì51 season on ABC, when it was expanded to a full hour.

Among the female disciples of Gautama Buddha, she was the foremost exponent of the Vinaya, the rules of monastic discipline. She lived during the 6th century BCE in what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India. The story of childbirth and loss below has been attributed to Patacara in some Buddhist texts and in others has been attributed to another woman, Kisa GotamiKisagotami Theri translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2006 http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thig/thig.10.01.than.html Retrieved March 31, 2017  Early life  Patacara was described as the beautiful daughter of a very wealthy merchant of Savatthi, in the Kosala Kingdom. Her previous name was Roopwati, the most beautiful girl of the whole town. Her over-protective parents used to love her dearly and provide her with every luxury. She also had a younger brother named Bharadwaj. Though she had everything, she was unhappy because of loneliness. She falls in love with one of her parents' servants Amarshanath, a young, good-looking and innocent boy, who had a lower social status. But Amarsh did not have any feelings for her initially. One fine day they go to a forest where they have sexual intercourse, after she wishes for it. At the same time, her parents arrange her marriage with Prince Revant, a handsome young man from a neighbouring kingdom. Roopvati finds out that she is pregnant with Amarsh's child. She decides to elope secretly with him. But Amarsh denies to betray his owners. She then requests him to escape with her before she is married off or everyone knows about her pregnancy. As planned, both Amarsh and Roopwati secretly elope from the palace with some money and ornaments, and reach a small village, far away from the palace to lead a simple but happy life. Then they settle down in a hut of a farmer. And they lead a struggling life to earn bread, without any luxury, but love each other very much. Her family gets furious after they come to know that their daughter has a relationship with a servant and both have eloped.  Childbirth  During her pregnancy, Patacara begged her husband to take her to her parents' house to give birth there, as was the tradition. She justified this by saying that parents always have a love for their child, no matter what has happened. Patacara's husband refused, stating that her parents would surely torture or imprison him. Realizing that he would not accompany her, she decided to go by herself. When he found out about this, he followed her and tried to persuade her to return, but in vain. So finally he agreed to accompany her. Before they could reach Savatthi, she delivered a baby boy. As there was no more reason to go to Savatthi, they turned back and resumed their life in the village. After a few years, Patacara became pregnant with her second child. Again, she requested her husband to take her home to her parents and when he refused, she began the journey by herself, taking her son with her. Her husband followed. She went to labour and she asked her husband to find some shelter. A heavy storm had hit the place. He went to search for some wood where he was bitten by a poisonous snake and died instantly. Meanwhile, Patacara gave birth to her second son. The next morning, she found her husband lying dead, his body rigid. Distraught, she blamed herself for his death.  Loss of family  Patacara running naked due to grief, pain and sorrow over loss of her family members She continued on her journey to Savatthi, but when she came to the river Aciravati, it was overflowing due to heavy rain. Unable to wade across with both children, she left the older child on the shore and carried the baby across to the other shore, before returning to take the first son. When she was midway through her return, a vulture swooped on the baby and flew off. Hearing his mother's screaming, the elder son believed Patacara was calling him and entered the water. He was swept off by the strong current. She had lost her husband and both children. She was devastated. Yet, she continued towards the city, in hope of meeting her parents. But on her way she was informed that her parents and brother had been killed after their house collapsed during the storm. Completely shattered and utterly depressed, Patacara becomes insane and then she crazily starts to scream and undress herself. The people used to throw the stones at her, called her crazy woman and tortured her, while nobody recognized who she was previously. She grew more aggressive and insane day-by-day. Whenever any sympathetic person used to try and cover her nude body with clothes, she used to tear those and scream at them. She gradually became unaware of the importance and conduct of clothes which was a great challenge to the norms and values of society. Thus came the name 'Patacara'. People used to hurl abuses at her. She ended up being completely ostracized from the village.  Buddhist life  At that time the Buddha was staying at the Jetavana, Anathapindika's monastery. Patacara, after running through Savatthi naked and disconsolate, prostrated at the feet of the Buddha, describing her family tragedies. The Buddha explained this using Buddhist doctrines, and Patacara immediately understood the nature of impermanence. When she was asked to tell her actual name, she felt awkward as her actual name was 'Roopwati' which means beauty and her condition was completely opposite of her name. Hence, she introduced herself as 'Patacara'. She thus became a sotapanna, the first stage of aryahood. The Buddha said that she was the foremost Keeper of the Vinaya amongst the Nuns, and thus the female counterpart of the monk Upali. Her interest in the \\"Rules of Conduct\\" of the monastic life was attributed to her reflections on her former indulgences. Adaptions * The Nepali novel Patachari, based on Patacara's whole life, was written by Nepali author and artist Ashok Mansingh and published in 2009. It describes the complete life story of Patacara with more original details and some colourful pictures. * The Nepalbhasa film Patachara was released in 2010, the story based on the life of Patacara, starring Nepalese stars Karma and Melina Manandhar. * In Sri Lanka, Sinhalese film Ape Kaalaye Patachara was screened in 2016, where Dulani Anuradha played the role.

Biography Browne was born in Richmond, Virginia. Browne entered the major leagues with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1901. Though he usually spent one or two seasons with a team, he remained with the New York Giants from 1902 to 1907. He was the National League leader in runs scored in 1904 with New York; runs were down across the league and Browne's 99 runs were the lowest total for a league leader until 1915. A member of the 1905 World Series champion Giants, Browne hit .227 with one RBI and two runs scored in the World Series. Moonlight Graham, whose one-inning major-league career became famous through the movie Field of Dreams, replaced Browne in his lone appearance for the 1905 Giants. Browne's \\"World's Champions\\" jersey, which the Giants wore during the 1906 season, was exhibited at the Baseball Hall of Fame. After leaving the Giants following the 1907 season, Browne played one season with the Boston Doves and was sold to the Chicago Cubs; the Washington Senators then purchased him early in the 1909 season. He remained there until mid-1910, when he was sold to the Chicago White Sox. For his career, he compiled a .273 batting average, 303 runs batted in, 614 runs scored, and 190 stolen bases.\\"George Browne Statistics and History\\". \\"baseball-reference.com. Retrieved May 16, 2017. In late 1920, Browne became sick with tuberculosis right as former teammate Christy Mathewson was recovering from the illness. Newspaper accounts highlighted the differences in financial capacity between the former star Mathewson and the lesser-known Browne.

In mathematics, the spherical mean of a function around a point is the average of all values of that function on a sphere of given radius centered at that point. Definition Consider an open set U in the Euclidean space Rn and a continuous function u defined on U with real or complex values. Let x be a point in U and r > 0 be such that the closed ball B(x, r) of center x and radius r is contained in U. The spherical mean over the sphere of radius r centered at x is defined as : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_{n-1}(r)}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\partial B(x, r)} \\\\\\\\! u(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} S(y) where ‚àÇB(x, r) is the (n‚àí1)-sphere forming the boundary of B(x, r), dS denotes integration with respect to spherical measure and œân‚àí1(r) is the \\"surface area\\" of this (n‚àí1)-sphere. Equivalently, the spherical mean is given by : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_{n-1}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\y\\\\=1} \\\\\\\\! u(x+ry) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S(y) where œân‚àí1 is the area of the (n‚àí1)-sphere of radius 1.

The spherical mean is also defined for Riemannian manifolds in a natural manner. Properties and uses * From the continuity of u it follows that the function ::r\\\\to \\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\partial B(x, r)}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-\\\\, u(y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}S(y) ::is continuous, and that its limit as r\\\\to 0 is u(x). * Spherical means can be used to solve the Cauchy problem for the wave equation \\\\partial^2_t u=c^2\\\\Delta u in odd space dimension. The result, known as Kirchoff's formula, is derived by using spherical means to reduce the wave equation in \\\\R^n (for odd n) to the wave equation in \\\\R, and then using d'Alembert's formula. The expression itself is presented in wave equation article. * If U is an open set in \\\\mathbb R^n and u is a C2 function defined on U, then u is harmonic if and only if for all x in U and all r>0 such that the closed ball B(x, r) is contained in U one has ::u(x)=\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\partial B(x, r)}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-\\\\, u(y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}S(y). : This result can be used to prove the maximum principle for harmonic functions.

Shannon was an outfielder over parts of five seasons (1904‚Äì1908) with the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates. He was the National League leader in runs scored in 1907, when he scored 104 runs for the Giants. For his career, he compiled a .259 batting average, 183 runs batted in, 383 runs scored, and 145 stolen bases. After his playing career, he was an umpire in the Federal League during 1914 and 1915 for a total of 177 games. Shannon was an alumnus of Grove City College. He was born in Pittsburgh, and later died in Minneapolis at the age of 65. Minor and Major League Career Spike Shannon made his major league debut on April 15, 1904 at the age of 29. Before then he toiled in the minor leagues, playing for teams like the Richmond BlueBirds of the Atlantic League, The Syracuse Stars of the Eastern League, and the St. Paul Saints of the American Association. With St. Paul he played in 135 games and batted .308 along with 41 stolen bases.https://www.baseball- reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=shanno003wil In September 1903, the St. Louis Cardinals draft Shannon from St. Paul as part of that years Rule 5 draft. In his first season in the big leagues, he played in 134 games and stole 34 bases. He batted .280 in his rookie season. His batting average fell over the course of the next two season,s though he remained a threat to steal on the base paths. On July 13, 1906, the Cardinals traded him to the Giants for catcher/outfielder Doc Marshall and OF/INF Sam Mertes. Despite having a .265 batting average in 1907, Shannon led the National League in runs scored with 104. He also lead the league in at bats and plate appearances as well. 1908 would be his final season as a major league player. He struggled to start the season, and placed on waivers by the Giants. The Pittsburgh Pirates claimed him off waivers and paid the Giants $1,500 for his rights. However, he continued to slump and on September 30, 1908, he played his final game, going one for four against the St. Louis Cardinals, ironically, the very team he'd made his major league debut for a few seasons earlier.https://www.baseball- reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=shanno003wil In 694 games over five seasons, Shannon posted a .259 batting average (677-for-2613) with 383 runs, 3 home runs, 183 RBI, 145 stolen bases and 286 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .974 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. Hoping to catch the eyes of scouts and make his way back to the big leagues, Shannon signed with the Kansas City Blues of the American Association. His batting slump continued and he retired after the 1911 season. Shannon still made another comeback at the age of 38 a few years later, this time for the Virginia Ore Diggers of the Northern League. In 52 games, the best he could muster was a .216 batting average. He retired after the 1911 season.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=shanno003wil After his playing days were over, Shannon returned to baseball again, this time as an umpire in the Federal League, a league that would go on to sue the both the American and National Leagues, accusing them of having a monopoly on major league baseball. The Federal League was hoping to become a third major, but the lawsuit drained the league of revenue and it went out of business.

The boundaries changed from time to time. In present time, the name \\"Tai Wo\\" mostly refers to the area surrounding the Tai Wo station of the East Rail Line and the Tai Wo Estate. However, historically, Tai Wo referred to the area that currently called Tai Po Market. Despite Tai Po Market was also the old name of another area, which currently known as Tai Po Old Market. All three areas are now part of Tai Po New Town ( Tai Po Town or just Tai Po), a satellite town (suburb) that co- jointed with the existing indigenous villages. History=Recent years Entrance of current \\"Tai Wo Market\\" on the G/F of Tai Wo Plaza Tai Po Sports Ground (front), Serenity Park (centre) and Tai Wo Plaza (far left) Currently, Tai Wo forms the north-western part of Tai Po Town. It has its own railway station Tai Wo station of the East Rail Line and a shopping centre. Tai Wo Estate and Po Nga Court are large public housing estates in the area, which they were situated on the northern shore of the Lam Tsuen River. Their shopping centre, Tai Wo Plaza, is adjacent to the Tai Wo station. Part of the ground floor of the shopping centre, was also named \\"Tai Wo Market\\" () as an indoor market. Both Tai Wo Estate and Po Nga Court were the residential projects of the Hong Kong Housing Authority, which initially they were part of the portfolios of rental housing and subsidised home ownership respectively. The authority sold the shopping centre of the housing estate to Link REIT in 2005, which the real estate investment trust renamed the shopping centre from Tai Wo shopping centre () to Tai Wo Plaza () in 2010. Tai Wo Estate and Po Nga Court were completed in 1989. According to an interview of an elder of the Tang clan of Tai Po Tau, some of the land of Tai Wo Estate, were originally farmlands that owned by Tang clan of Tai Po Tau. (Or more precisely, owned the long term land lease, leasing from the government) Government bought back the farmlands for Tai Po New Town development. Ironically, Tang clan of Tai Po Tau, was one of the operators of the original Tai Po Market, now the residential area Tai Po Old Market, while Tai Wo was named after the historic Tai Wo Market, which now known as Tai Po Market. The area of Tai Wo Estate, was planned as an industrial area. However, the plan was scrapped in 1983. Connection of the historic Tai Wo Market and current Tai Po Market Historically, \\"Tai Wo\\" was the name of the current outdoor market area (), which was situated on the Southern shore of the Lam Tsuen River. It was one of the market town of Tai Po and surrounding villages. Fu Shin Street, at that time known as Tai Wo Market ( transliteration Tai Wo Shi) or Tai Po New Market () was developed since 1892 by the (). Which Tsat Yeuk was an inter-village alliance, none of them were from Tang clan. The formation of a new market town, was intended to break the monopoly of the [old] Tai Po Market (, now Tai Po Old Market) formed by the Tang clans of Lung Yeuk Tau () and Tai Po Tau (). The Tai Po Old Market (, transliteration Tai Po Kau Hui) was located on the Northern shore of the Lam Tsuen River. In early Qing dynasty, Tai Po Old Market was known as Tai Po Tau Hui (). Tsat Yeuk also built Kwong Fuk Bridge which connects the two market towns, as well as Tai Po's Man Mo Temple which located in the centre of Fu Shin Street. To add more confusion to the name, government also runs an indoor wet market () in , while its former location (), was redeveloped into a public housing estate , where they are near to the Fu Shin Street. All three locations were belongs to \\"Tai Po Market\\" District Council Election Constituency of 2015 Hong Kong local elections. The headquarters of Tai Po Rural Committee of Heung Yee Kuk, was located in the former school building of the Sung Tak primary school (not to be confused with Sung Tak Wong Kin Sheung Memorial School), which is located at one end of Fu Shin Street. The former headquarters was redeveloped into aforementioned Po Heung Estate. Tai Po Rural Committee supervised some of the matter of the villages of indigenous inhabitants of Tai Po. Tai Wo Shi (Fu Shin Street) was served by [old] Tai Po Market railway station. The accessibility of Tai Wo Shi had made the area as one of the important market town of the New Territories. However, the railway station was closed in 1983 and was replaced by the current Tai Po Market station and Tai Wo station on different locations. To sum up, despite historically known as Tai Wo, area around Fu Shin Street has known as Tai Po Market, and became the town centre of Tai Po, housing various government buildings. Other namesake Lastly, is a public road that start from an area next to the Tai Wo Estate, and then connects to area such as , a privately owned high rise commercial-residential complex, as well as Tai Po Police Station (not to be confused with Old Tai Po Police Station), and ends on the western boundary of Tai Po Waterfront Park. Most part of the road are not part of the historic Tai Wo Market, nor the current Tai Wo Estate. In election boundaries Current map of the election constituencies of the Tai Po District. Tai Po Hui is marked as P01, Old Market & Serenity is marked as P16, Tai Woo is marked as P15 and Po Nga was marked as P14 In 2015 Hong Kong local elections, the name of the District Council Election Constituency that Fu Shin Street (the historic Tai Wo Market) was located, was called \\"Tai Po Hui\\" (), while the large part of Tai Wo Estate was the only residential area of the election constituency \\"Tai Wo\\"; Po Nga Court and other part of Tai Wo Estate were the only residential area of the election constituency \\"Po Nga\\". North of \\"Tai Wo\\" constituency, was the \\"Old Market & Serenity\\" constituency (), where Tai Po Old Market was located. Tai Po Old Market currently a pure residential area, while Serenity Park is another privately owned residential complex. The current Tai Po Market station, was located on the boundary between \\"Tai Po Hui\\" constituency and \\"San Fu\\" () constituency; the bus terminus of the station, which was located on the ground floor and underground level of a commercial-residential complex, (), was entirely inside \\"San Fu\\" constituency. Tai Wo station was located on the boundary between constituencies \\"Tai Wo\\" and \\"Po Nga\\".

William Bradford IV and William Bradford the Younger; 16 June 1624 ‚Äì 20 February 1703) was a political and military leader in Plymouth Colony in the late 17th century. Early life Coat of Arms of William Bradford Major Bradford was the son of Governor William Bradford and his second wife, Alice Carpenter Southworth. Born four years after the Pilgrims arrival in 1620, William was his father's second child, but the first born in the new world. His older half-brother John Bradford had been left behind in Leiden, Netherlands. Military service Bradford was commissioned as the ensign (3rd in command) of the Plymouth militia company on March 7, 1648. He held this position until he was promoted to lieutenant on October 2, 1659. He was commissioned as the major-commandant of the Plymouth Colony militia regiment on June 3, 1673. He succeeded newly elected Governor Josias Winslow who held the position since it was established in 1658. He held the rank of major in the militia and was the commander of the military forces of Plymouth Colony during the King Philip's War. He commanded the Plymouth Regiment, consisting of two companies, at the Great Swamp Fight, in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, on 19 December 1675. During the battle, his eye was wounded and he was hit by a musket ball which he carried in his body to his grave. Political service He later served as the deputy governor of Plymouth Colony under Governor Thomas Hinckley from 1682 to 1686 and from 1689 to 1692 when the colony was merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Bradford was suspended from office during the governorship of Sir Edmund Andros from December 20, 1686 to April 18, 1689. Family Major Bradford was married three times (1st: Alice Richards; 2nd: Sarah ‚Äì, widow of Francis Griswold; 3rd: Mary Atwood, widow of John Holmes) and fathered fifteen children from the three marriages.

The hotel was opened in 1957 and the building, projected by Dragi≈°a Bra≈°ovan, has been declared a cultural monument in 2001.  Location  The hotel is located at the corner of the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and Karnegijeva street, in the municipality of Palilula. North and west of the hotel, in the same block, are the Little Ta≈°majdan, easternmost extension of the Ta≈°majdan park, and the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law, respectively. East of the hotel, right across the Karnegijeva are the Archive of Serbia, Belgrade University Library and the complex of the University's technical faculties: Architecture, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Technology and Metallurgy. Some of the attractions in the vicinity include the Church of St. Mark, the Vukov Spomenik area and the Slavija Square but due to its location, nothing in downtown Belgrade is too distant from the hotel.  History = Congress Center  Projected as the House of the Central Committee of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia, the building was originally envisioned as the \\"largest congress center in the Balkans\\". Construction was part of the vast program of the Youth work actions and began in the summer of 1949. Some 15 youth brigades, with 18,000 people, were employed at the construction site but the works ceased in November 1950.  Hotel  After the idea of the congress center was abandoned, architect Dragi≈°a Bra≈°ovan revised the plans and adapted the structure as the highrise hotel. Construction works were continued in 1954 and, though they were finalized in 1958, the hotel was opened for guests on 20 August 1957. The building was declared a cultural monument in 2001. In 2002 a major fire broke out at the hotel, completely destroying the two last floors. The rest of the hotel, however, remained open until 2008.  Famous guests  In the 1960s and 1970s the Metropol was one of the most popular and elite venues in Belgrade and President of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, organized his New Year's Eve celebrations in the hotel. During the First Summit of the Non- Aligned Movement in 1961, a reception was organized for 30 heads of state or government and over 3,000 guests. VIP guests included: * politics: Haile Selassie, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Jawaharlal Nehru, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, Leonid Brezhnev, Habib Bourguiba, Che Guevara; * literature: Ivo Andriƒá; * film and theater: Anthony Quinn, Brigitte Bardot, Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Jack Nicholson, Kirk Douglas, Robert De Niro, Judith Malina, Julian Beck, Bernardo Bertolucci, Melina Mercouri, Roman Polanski, Alfred Hitchcock; * chess: Bobby Fischer, Tigran Petrosian, Mikhail Tal, Boris Spassky; * astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin; * music: Igor Stravinsky, Louis Armstrong, who was awaited by numerous fans for hours, but he would slip through the back doors. Celebrating re-opening of the hotel and the 55th anniversary, an exhibition was held in the renovated hotel in October 2012 and a monograph on the hotel's history, \\"History of the five stars\\" was published. Among other data, it contains photos of celebrity guests and anecdotes on their time in Metropol.  2008-2012 reconstruction  In 2006, the hotel was purchased by the \\"Sheraton Sofia Hotel Balkan\\" for 27,4 million euros. The complete reconstruction of the edifice, worth over 40 million euros, began in 2008 and was halted twice in the next 4 years. No work has been done at all from 2009 to September 2011 with the various reasons given: European debt crisis, bad relations within the family company which acquired the hotel but the unofficial stories that the Metropol has been resold also circulated. In 2011 the owners promised that the works will be finished in 2012. Additional pressure were the newly adopted penalties for the investors who do not \\"beautify edifices in the city's priority touristic zones\\" by June 2013. Penalty amount by the law, colloquially called \\"the tax on ugliness\\", was set at 2 million euros. The hotel was temporarily opened in June 2012 as the five-star venue under the name Metropol Palace. It began to receive guests on 9 September 2012 while some works remained in progress until the end of the year. On 15 October 2012 it was announced that the Metropol Palace officially joined the Starwood hotels chain, under the Luxury Collection brand-category. The architecture bureau DOMAA, situated in Belgrade, was in charge for the reconstruction of the hotel Metropol Palace. The chief architect and the author of the reconstruction was architect Miodrag Trpkovic, job captain - architect Jasmina Djordjevic and assistant to the job captain was architect Srdjan Gavrilovic. Main arch. technitian was Dragana Dimitrijevic.  Architecture  The Metropol is known for its specific, white fa√ßade, the large stained glass window and the mosaic. Due to the protection as the cultural monument, they were not to be changed during the reconstruction but they were fully restored. In front of the hotel is the fountain with the sculpture \\"The girl takes a shower\\". The lobby has marbled floor and a large wall painting made from the inlayed pieces of differently colored wood. It was especially ordered by Bra≈°ovan for the hotel in 1956. The hotel had a total floor area of which was enlarged to after the 2012 reconstruction. The reconstructed hotel has several restaurants, spa, fitness center, sauna, steambath, massage center, gym and the meeting halls with the capacity of 1,000 guests. An underground, three-level garage with 100 parking spots was built so as the bar on the hotel's flat roof. There are 199 rooms, 130 in the main body of the building while 69 rooms and 40 suites are in the so-called annex, the eastern extension. The suites include the presidential and the royal ones.

He is best known as one of the key figures in the November 1963 coup that led to the arrest and assassination of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, the first president of the Republic of Vietnam, commonly known as South Vietnam. A favorite of the ruling Ng√¥ family, ƒê√≠nh received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favor with Di·ªám and headed the military wing of the C·∫ßn Lao party, a secret Catholic organization that maintained the Ng√¥s' grip on power. At the age of 32, ƒê√≠nh became the youngest ever ARVN general and the commander of the II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical, and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying. In 1962, ƒê√≠nh, whom Di·ªám regarded as one of his most loyal officers, was appointed commander of the III Corps that oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon, making him important to the prospects of any coup. In late 1963, as Di·ªám became increasingly unpopular, ƒê√≠nh's colleagues recruited him into a coup plot by playing on his ego and pitting him against Di·ªám. Di·ªám and his brother and chief advisor Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu were aware of the plot but did not know of ƒê√≠nh's involvement. Nhu planned a fake coup of his own in an attempt to trap his opponents and strengthen the family's regime. ƒê√≠nh was placed in charge of the fake coup and sabotaged it. On November 1 the rebels' actual coup proceeded and the Ng√¥ brothers were deposed and executed. After the coup, ƒê√≠nh became one of the 12 members of the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC), but this lasted only three months before a bloodless coup by General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh. ƒê√≠nh and his colleagues were put under house arrest by Kh√°nh and falsely accused of promoting a neutralist plot. The subsequent military trial collapsed. The generals were convicted of \\"lax morality\\", but were eventually allowed to resume their military service, albeit in meaningless desk jobs. Following Kh√°nh's exile by another group of generals, ƒê√≠nh was appointed to command the I Corps in 1966 and ordered to put down the Buddhist Uprising, but Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ disapproved of his conciliatory policies. K·ª≥ launched a successful surprise attack against ƒê√≠nh, who fled, but was later captured and briefly imprisoned by K·ª≥. After his release, ƒê√≠nh worked in the media and was elected to the Senate in 1967. He served in the upper house until the fall of Saigon in April 1975, when he fled Vietnam. Early years ƒê√≠nh was born in the central highlands resort town of Da Lat on November 20, 1926, into the T√¥n Th·∫•t family of Hu·∫ø that were relatives of the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. In 1943, he took a clerical job at Da Lat Court. He enlisted in the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) of the French-backed State of Vietnam at Phu Bai in 1949, and was first trained as a non- commissioned officer at Mang C√°, Hu·∫ø, before being accepted into the first intake of the Hu·∫ø Military Academy. After one year of training, he was commissioned as a lieutenant. He then trained as a paratrooper and attended Cavalry School in Saumur, France.Sheehan, p. 356. As a captain, he was made the commanding officer of the VNA's Mobile Task Force (GM 2) in Ninh Giang in northern Vietnam, and after graduating at the top of a Military Staff Training Course in Hanoi, was promoted to the rank of major and put in command of the forces in Duy√™n H·∫£i, in the northern coastal province of Th√°i B√¨nh as a battalion commander. In 1952, he was made a lieutenant colonel as appointed to command the 31st Tactical Group (GM 31), based in the province of H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng but also covered the adjoining provinces of Nam ƒê·ªãnh and Ninh B√¨nh. He was the Deputy Commander of Operations for Colonel Paul Vanuxem when the VNA and French Far East Expeditionary Corps withdrew from Ninh B√¨nh to Tuy H√≤a on the South Central Coast as part of Operation Auvergn following the partition of Vietnam. He became a protege of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, a younger brother of Prime Minister Di·ªám. C·∫©n, who unofficially controlled the region of central Vietnam near Hu·∫ø, was impressed by what he considered to be an abundance of courage on the part of ƒê√≠nh. Within six years of enlisting in the military, ƒê√≠nh had risen to the rank of colonel and was made the inaugural commander of the newly formed 32nd Division based in Da Nang in the centre of the country on January 1, 1955. ƒê√≠nh led the unit until November 1956, during which time it was renamed the 2nd Division.Tucker, pp. 526‚Äì33. Di·ªám deposed head of state B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i in a fraudulent referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam, commonly known as South Vietnam.Jacobs, pp. 86‚Äì89. The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, ƒê√≠nh had converted to Catholicism in the hope of advancing his career. The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Di·ªám dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.Jacobs, pp. 88‚Äì95. ƒê√≠nh once described himself as \\"fearless and arrogant\\" and Di·ªám's adopted son;Wright, p. 40. the president was a lifelong bachelor.Jacobs, p. 19. In August 1957, he was appointed commander of the 1st Division based in Hu·∫ø, the old imperial capital and C·∫ßn's base. ƒê√≠nh served there for one year, until he became a one-star general and received a wider-reaching command in August 1958,Karnow, pp. 307‚Äì22. making him the youngest ever ARVN general.Tucker, pp. 288‚Äì89. ƒê√≠nh's favour among the Ng√¥ family saw him appointed in 1958 to head the military wing of the C·∫ßn Lao, the secret organisation of Vietnamese Catholics loyal to the Ng√¥ family that maintained the family's grip on power. Despite the high regard in which the Ng√¥ family held him, ƒê√≠nh had a poor reputation among his colleagues. Regarded by his peers as ambitious, vain and impulsive, he was known mainly for heavily drinking in Saigon's nightclubs,Jacobs, p. 169. and the Central Intelligence Agency labelled him a \\"basic opportunist\\".Prochnau, pp. 442‚Äì43. He was known for always wearing a paratrooper's uniform with a red beret at a steep angle, and being accompanied by a tall, uncommunicative Cambodian bodyguard.Jones, p. 397. Senior Australian Army officer Ted Serong, who worked with ƒê√≠nh, called him \\"a young punk with a gun ‚Äì and dangerous\\".Blair (2001), p. 56. X√° L·ª£i Pagoda In August 1958, ƒê√≠nh was made the commander of the II Corps, which oversaw the Central Highlands region mainly inhabited by indigenous tribes. He was based in the mountainous town of Pleiku and oversaw the surrounding region and the lowlands to the north of the capital of Saigon.Hickey, pp. 100‚Äì01. This put him in control of the 5th, 22nd and 23rd Divisions, one third of the divisions in the country. At the time, the CIA had been training Montagnard tribesmen under the Village Defense Program (later to become the Civilian Irregular Defense Group) with the stated intention of resisting communist infiltration, but ƒê√≠nh regarded it was an attempt to divide and conquer and undermine him. He estimated that 18,000 tribesmen had been armed,Blair (2001), p. 62. and said to Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu ‚Äì one of Di·ªám's younger brothers and his chief adviser ‚Äì that \\"the Americans have put an army at my back\\". CIA officer Lucien Conein admitted years afterwards that ƒê√≠nh's claim was correct; that Nhu and Di·ªám had no previous idea of what the Americans had been doing.Catton, p. 155. ƒê√≠nh wrote to Di·ªám to complain that his units were being weakened by the policy of promoting officers for political reasons,Toczek, p. 45. despite having been a beneficiary himself of this non-merit-based policy. The reorganisation of the corps boundaries in December 1962 created a fourth region. The entire region surrounding the capital, Saigon, came under the purview of the III Corps, whereas the previous arrangement saw two corps controlling the regions to the north and south of the capital. As a key supporter of Di·ªám, ƒê√≠nh was named commander of the III Corps, because the Ng√¥ family trusted him to defend them in the face of any coup attempts. Under the III Corps were the 5th and the 25th Divisions, which were located in Bi√™n H√≤a and Cu Chi, on the north-eastern and north-western outskirts of Saigon respectively. In August 1963, Nhu, who controlled the special forces and secret police, allowed ƒê√≠nh to have a hand in planning raids against Buddhist dissidents who had been organising at the X√° L·ª£i pagoda,Halberstam, p. 181. Saigon's largest.Karnow, p. 301. The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division into the capital.Blair (2001), p. 59. Although the execution of the raids ‚Äì which left hundreds dead ‚Äì was primarily the responsibility of Colonel L√™ Quang Tung, the special forces head,Halberstam, p. 145. ƒê√≠nh privately took responsibility, stating to a journalist, \\"I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [the US ambassador to South Vietnam]. He came here to stage a coup d'etat, but I, T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, have conquered him and saved the country.\\"Halberstam, p. 147. In the aftermath of the raids, Foreign Minister V≈© VƒÉn M·∫´u resigned in protest, shaved his head like a monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India; Nhu ordered ƒê√≠nh to jail him. At the urging of another general, ƒê√≠nh put M·∫´u under house arrest instead.Sheehan, p. 357. During this period, ƒê√≠nh told a dinner guest that he had the pleasure of dining with a great national hero. When the guest asked ƒê√≠nh where the hero was, ƒê√≠nh said \\"it is me\\" and claimed to have defeated the Americans. ƒê√≠nh's ego had been played upon by the Ng√¥ brothers, who had themselves reiterated this point and paid him a large cash bonus after the pagoda raids.Sheehan, pp. 356‚Äì57. In the heady times after the attacks, ƒê√≠nh had a \\"somewhat incoherent\\" debate with his American advisor, claiming \\"he [ƒê√¨nh] was without doubt the greatest general officer in the ARVN, the saviour of Saigon ... and soon he would be the top military man in the country.\\"Catton, p. 203. In a press conference after the raids, ƒê√≠nh claimed to have saved South Vietnam from Buddhists, communists and \\"foreign adventurers\\", a euphemism for the United States. After being questioned sharply, ƒê√≠nh quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International asked him to name the country that he was referring to, but ƒê√≠nh dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero should be able to identify the national enemy, and asked him to call Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, ƒê√≠nh stormed out of the conference.Halberstam, p. 182. Defection and coup Embarrassed by the events at the press conference, ƒê√≠nh returned to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters. His colleagues, led by General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, were plotting a coup against Di·ªám because of the Buddhist crisis, and attempted to play on ƒê√≠nh's ego to convince him to join them. They knew that without ƒê√≠nh's assistance, a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured ƒê√≠nh that he was a national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. ƒê√≠nh's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power.Halberstam, pp. 182‚Äì83. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Di·ªám's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised ƒê√≠nh to ask Di·ªám to promote him to interior minister, D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh to defence minister, and Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Minh to education minister. The other generals hoped that would reject ƒê√≠nh and wound his pride. As a result, ƒê√≠nh and his fellow generals met Di·ªám at the palace, where ƒê√≠nh asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister. Di·ªám bluntly chastised ƒê√≠nh in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of ƒê√† L·∫°t to rest. ƒê√≠nh felt humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his colleagues that he would be successful. The Ng√¥ brothers had been alarmed by ƒê√≠nh's request, and put him under surveillance. ƒê√≠nh found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. ƒê√≠nh agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides. With ƒê√≠nh and the Ng√¥ family's increasing focus on the political usage of the army, the military situation in the III Corps deteriorated badly in the second half of 1963, as personnel were redeployed into the cities. In August, he moved a unit away from B·∫øn T∆∞·ª£ng, which had been portrayed as a model settlement in the Strategic Hamlet Program that was supposed to isolate peasants into fortified villages to keep the Viet Cong out. While the unit was in Saigon cracking down on the Buddhists, the communists overran B·∫øn T∆∞·ª£ng. A year earlier, the American media contingent had been invited to the opening ceremony of the settlement, which was supposed to be the flagship of the hamlet program.Catton, pp. 173‚Äì75. As ƒê√≠nh spent most of October in the capital plotting instead of inspecting the countryside, the communists began to systematically dismantle the strategic hamlets. Plotting a fake coup By mid-October, Di·ªám and Nhu knew of the coup plans, but did not know that ƒê√≠nh was firmly among them, although they were wary of him.Karnow, p. 318. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him.Jones, p. 398. The other generals were still suspicious of ƒê√≠nh, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them and unsure of his true loyalties, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ng√¥ brothers. As part of the generals' plot, ƒê√≠nh sent Colonel Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥, his deputy corps commander, to M·ªπ Tho to talk to the 7th Division commander, Colonel B√πi ƒê√¨nh ƒê·∫°m, and two regimental commanders subordinate to ƒê·∫°m, and the chief of M·ªπ Tho province. Exhorting them to join the coup, he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao, and that ƒê√≠nh would soon join. According to one account, ƒê√≠nh had intended that loyalists would report C√≥'s activities to Di·ªám and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace. Nhu's agents soon reported C√≥'s activities to the palace. When the Ng√¥ brothers confronted ƒê√≠nh with what occurred in M·ªπ Tho, ƒê√≠nh feigned astonishment at his deputy's behavior, crying and vowing to have C√≥ killed.Moyar, p. 265. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted to keep C√≥ alive to catch the plotters and tried to use ƒê√≠nh to this end. Nhu ordered ƒê√≠nh and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command,Karnow, p. 317. to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated.Jones, pp. 398‚Äì99. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime. Codenamed Operation Bravo, the first stage of the scheme would involve some of ƒê√≠nh and Tung's loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents led by apparently renegade junior officers, faking a coup and vandalizing the capital.Hatcher, p. 149. Tung would then announce the formation of a \\"revolutionary government\\" consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to joining the new administration, while Di·ªám and Nhu would pretend to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the disguised loyalists would riot and in the ensuing mayhem, kill the leading coup plotters, such as Generals Minh, ƒê√¥n, L√™ VƒÉn Kim and junior officers that were helping them. The loyalists and some of Nhu's underworld connections would also kill some figures who were assisting the conspirators, such as the titular but relatively powerless Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, CIA agent Lucien Conein (who was on assignment in Vietnam as a military adviser), and Ambassador Lodge. These would then be blamed on \\"neutralist and pro-communist elements\\".Sheehan, p. 368. A fake \\"counter-coup\\" was to follow, whereupon Tung's special forces, having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting communists, as well as ƒê√≠nh's regulars, would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to reaffirm the Di·ªám regime. Nhu would then exploit the scare to round up dissidents.Karnow, p. 319. ƒê√≠nh was put in charge of the fake coup and was allowed the additional control of the 7th Division based in M·ªπ Tho, which was previously assigned to Di·ªám loyalist Cao, who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. The reassignment of the 7th Division gave ƒê√≠nh and his III Corps complete encirclement of Saigon, and would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Di·ªám as he had done during the coup attempt in 1960.Hatcher, pp. 145‚Äì46. Nhu and Tung, however, were unaware that ƒê√≠nh was part of the real coup plot. ƒê√≠nh told Tung that the fake coup needed to employ an overwhelming amount of force. He said that tanks were required \\"because armour is dangerous\\". In an attempt to outwit Tung, ƒê√≠nh claimed fresh troops were needed,Jones, p. 399. opining, \\"If we move reserves into the city, the Americans will be angry. They'll complain that we're not fighting the war. So we must camouflage our plan by sending the special forces out to the country. That will deceive them.\\" The loyalists were unaware that ƒê√≠nh's real intention was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's men in the countryside where they could not defend the president. Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital on 29 October. Not trusting C√≥, Di·ªám put a Catholic loyalist, Colonel L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t, in command of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Ph√°t had to pay the corps commander a courtesy visit before assuming control. ƒê√≠nh refused to see Ph√°t and told him to come back on Friday at 14:00, by which time the coup had already been scheduled to start. In the meantime, ƒê√≠nh had ƒê√¥n sign a counter-order transferring command of the 7th Division to C√≥. The next day, C√≥ took the division's incumbent officers prisoner and used the unit to block loyalists from storming the capital from the south. Di·ªám's downfall On November 1, 1963, the coup went ahead with Cao's troops isolated in the far south and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Di·ªám from the rebel encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Di·ªám and Nhu to make contact with ƒê√≠nh were blocked by other generals, who claimed that ƒê√≠nh was elsewhere. This led the Ng√¥ brothers to think that ƒê√≠nh had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, ƒê√≠nh was allowed to have the final word with Di·ªám before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause. ƒê√≠nh subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ng√¥ brothers. ƒê√≠nh alleged that Nhu's contacts with the communists and threats to make a peace deal with North Vietnam had motivated the coup.Jones, p. 421. When Di·ªám and Nhu were shot dead by the arresting officers against the orders of the generals, ƒê√≠nh claimed he \\"couldn't sleep that night\\".Jones, p. 429. He boasted to the media that he and his troops were responsible for seizing broadcasting studios, the police headquarters, T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base, and the release of hundreds of political prisoners such as monks and students.Wright, p. 41. He also claimed that he led the successful siege on Gia Long Palace, although the 5th Division of Colonel Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu had actually carried it out.Jones, pp. 412‚Äì15.Hammer, p. 299. ƒê√≠nh saved the life of Colonel Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, the commander of the Airborne Brigade, who was a Di·ªám loyalist. Vi√™n's fate had been discussed during the planning phase.Hung, p. 79. ƒê√≠nh, who played mahjong with Vi√™n's wife, convinced Minh to spare the paratroop commander, saying that Vi√™n would not oppose the coup. At the JGS meeting, Vi√™n, who had not known of the plot, removed his insignia and resigned, and was arrested for refusing to join the coup.Moyar, p. 267. Vi√™n was allowed to return to his command a month later, and later became the chief of JGS for eight years.Tucker, p. 62. Post-Di·ªám Following the coup, a Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) was formed, comprising 12 generals including ƒê√≠nh, each of whom had equal voting power. They appointed a cabinet mainly consisting of civilians led by Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, who had been the titular Vice President under Di·ªám.Jones, pp. 99‚Äì100. ƒê√≠nh was initially made interior minister, but Th∆° was said to have personally opposed the appointment. Eventually Minh, the head of the military junta, struck a compromise whereby ƒê√≠nh was made Security Minister and Administrative Affairs, which partially covered the interior ministry. He was the 2nd Deputy Chairman of the MRC behind Minh and ƒê√¥n.Kahin, p. 648. However, tension persisted as Th∆°'s civilian government was plagued by infighting. According to Th∆°'s assistant, Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Huy, the presence of ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. ƒê√≠nh and ƒê√¥n were subordinate to Th∆° in the civilian government, but as members of the MRC they were superior to him. When Th∆° gave a cabinet order with which the generals disagreed, they went to the MRC and gave a counter-order.Jones, p. 437. ƒê√≠nh and the new national police chief, General Xu√¢n, were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty.Shaplen, p. 221. The junta performed indecisively and was heavily criticised, especially Minh, who was viewed as being too apathetic towards his country's situation. During the MRC's tenure, South Vietnam suffered more and more losses to the Vietcong.Blair (1995), p. 91.Shaplen, pp. 220‚Äì24.Karnow, p. 340. Policies ƒê√≠nh was reported to have celebrated his new positions by making conspicuous appearances at Saigon nightclubs and dancing, having lifted Madame Nhu's bans on such activities. He reportedly kissed the bar dancers and ordered champagne for all present. ƒê√≠nh's brash behavior caused public relations problems for the junta. In interviews with the Washington Post and The New York Times, he claimed that he took a leading role in the coup because \\"we would have lost the war under Di·ªám\\" and saying that he participated \\"not for personal ambition, but for the population, the people and to get rid of Nhu\\". He claimed to have been the \\"specialist ... [who] gave the orders in only thirty minutes\\", keeping the plans \\"all in his head\\". In an exclusive interview with Herndon, he said \\"You are the one who started it all, who drove me into making the coup. You are the hero of the revolution.\\" This was a reference to Herndon's sarcastic reference to ƒê√≠nh as a \\"great national hero\\" after the general took credit for the pagoda raids. He also courted controversy with anti-American remarks, stating \\"On August 21, I was governor of Saigon and loyal to Diem; on November 1, I was governor of Saigon and fighting Diem; maybe in the future I'll be governor of Saigon and fighting against the Americans.\\"Jones, pp. 437‚Äì38. ƒê√≠nh and the leading generals in the MRC also had a secret plan to end the communist insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent of the government of North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Di·ªám. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible.Kahin, pp. 648‚Äì50. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.Kahin, p. 653. During his time on the MRC, ƒê√≠nh persistently raised eyebrows with his volatile behaviour. The Americans and his colleagues found him difficult to control. General Paul Harkins, the head of the US military presence in Vietnam, advised ƒê√≠nh to relinquish his control of the III Corps on the grounds that he was already serving as the interior minister and that a corps needed a full-time leader, but ƒê√≠nh refused. As the III Corps surrounded the capital, the most economically productive region in South Vietnam, it had the most scope for corruption and graft.Blair (1995), p. 90. ƒê√≠nh told U.S. embassy officials in December 1963 he was preparing to \\"accommodate himself to a neutralist solution for Vietnam\\".Blair (1995), p. 105. This reportedly perturbed the Americans and was interpreted as a threat to not cooperate with the anti-communist struggle if his power was wound back. US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara criticised the arrangement,Blair (1995), p. 101. and in early January 1964, ƒê√≠nh was relieved by General Khi·ªám, who had been the head of the armed forces until being demoted after the coup against Di·ªám, and he set about overthrowing the MRC.Blair (1995), p. 108. Deposed by Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh ƒê√≠nh's political stay was brief, as General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh, who was disgruntled at not receiving a high position after Di·ªám's removal, deposed the MRC with the support of Khi·ªám on 30 January 1964, without firing a shot. Kh√°nh used the coup to exact retribution against Generals ƒê√¥n, ƒê√≠nh, Xuan and L√™ VƒÉn Kim. Kh√°nh had them arrested, claiming that they were part of a neutralist plot with the French government of President Charles de Gaulle to make a peace deal with North Vietnam that would not end communism. Kh√°nh noted they had all served in the French-backed VNA prior to 1955, although he had as well. He also accused the four generals of discussing such a plan with some visiting politicians from de Gaulle's party during a dinner, although ƒê√≠nh and his accused colleagues denied that the meeting was anything more than social.Kahin, p. 666. The generals were flown to M·ªπ Khe beach, near ƒê√† N·∫µng.Karnow, pp. 350‚Äì51. Kh√°nh presided over their trial of ƒê√≠nh and his colleagues on 28 May 1964.Blair (1995), p. 115. The generals were interrogated for five and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Di·ªám, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in Di·ªám's overthrow, the hearings did not reveal any new information. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Kh√°nh stated, \\"We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody\\".Langguth, pp. 289‚Äì91. The tribunal then \\"congratulated\\" the generals, but found that they were of \\"lax morality\\" and unqualified to command due to a \\"lack of a clear political concept\\". They were chastised for being \\"inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility\\" and of letting \\"their subordinates take advantage of their positions\\". ƒê√≠nh's quartet were allowed to remain in ƒê√† L·∫°t under surveillance. The four generals were barred from commanding troops and offices were prepared so they could participate in \\"research and planning\\". Worried that the idle group would plot against him, Kh√°nh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the U.S. for military study, but this failed.Shaplen, pp. 244‚Äì45.Karnow, p. 355. When Kh√°nh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that ƒê√≠nh and the other generals were innocent and that his charges were dishonest, before going into exile.Langguth, p. 347. Historian Robert Shaplen said that \\"the case ... continued to be one of Kh√°nh's biggest embarrassments.\\" During the period of house arrest, Kh√°nh briefly released ƒê√≠nh and Kim when the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races, known by its French acronym of FULRO, launched an uprising in the central highlands calling for autonomy for indigenous people. ƒê√≠nh and Kim were sent to Ban M√™ Thu·ªôt in an attempt to end the standoff in September 1964, but after negotiations stalled, they conferred with Kh√°nh and decided to order ARVN troops to crush the rebellion, which was carried out successfully.Hickey, pp. 154‚Äì60. 1966 Buddhist protests and senate career alt=Middle-aged man with side-parted black hair and moustache, in a black suit, white shirt and brown tie. To the left is a clean-shaven Asian man with black hair and a green military cap. With the rise to power of Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ ‚Äì head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force ‚Äì following Kh√°nh's departure, returned to a command role in the army. ƒê√≠nh was transferred from his post as Director General of Military Training, and in April 1966, he was appointed to lead the I Corps, based in central Vietnam. ƒê√≠nh was the third commander of the corps within five weeks. This upheaval came about after the dismissal of Lieutenant General Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi due to his sympathies towards Buddhist activists and because K·ª≥ viewed him as a personal threat. In response, Buddhist protesters brought the region to a standstill with anti- American and anti-war demonstrations, some of which descended into rioting. The protests were supported by groups of rebel I Corps soldiers and the mayor of ƒê√† N·∫µng, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Man, who had been appointed by Thi. These anti-K·ª≥ groups formed a coalition known as the Struggle Movement.Topmiller, pp. 39‚Äì43. Thi's replacement, General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Chu√¢n, refused to confront the dissidents or shut them down. He was content to allow protests provided there was no insurrection.Topmiller, pp. 35‚Äì39. Prime Minister K·ª≥ disapproved of Chuan's approach and replaced Chuan with ƒê√≠nh. Prime Minister K·ª≥ felt ƒê√≠nh's aggressive attitude following the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids in 1963 indicated a willingness to suppress Buddhist dissidents. Moreover, ƒê√≠nh was a native of central Vietnam and would have been popular with those who thought along parochial lines. ƒê√≠nh arrived in Hu·∫ø on 15 April and, after a week, announced that he had restored Saigon's authority over the region. He proclaimed that he had regained control of the radio stations in ƒê√† N·∫µng and Hu·∫ø from the dissidents, and that he had convinced the mayor of ƒê√† N·∫µng to remain loyal to Saigon. ƒê√≠nh announced a deal whereby the Buddhists would have regular air time in return for relinquishing control of the radio station. This move was interpreted in different ways. Some felt that ƒê√≠nh was attempting to gain favour with the Buddhists in anticipation of K·ª≥'s fall from power, while Frances FitzGerald felt it was the only sensible government action during the crisis.Topmiller, pp. 57‚Äì58. On 19 April, clashes erupted in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i between the Buddhists and the VNQDƒê (Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which supported the continuation of the anti-communist war, prompting ƒê√≠nh to forcibly restrain the two groups.Topmiller, p. 63. Soon after, K·ª≥ made a surprise attack to assert government control over central Vietnam. He flew out to ƒê√† N·∫µng with his own units, without consulting the Americans or officials in I Corps.Gibbons, p. 315. At this time, ƒê√≠nh was pursuing a policy of reconciliation ƒê√† N·∫µng and negotiation with the dissident I Corps units, and making contact with the Struggle Movement.Topmiller, p. 85. K·ª≥ decided to attack and sent his forces to overrun Dinh's headquarters on 15 May, forcing the latter to abandon his post and flee to the headquarters of U.S. General Lewis Walt. Fearing K·ª≥'s forces would kill him, ƒê√≠nh asked Walt for help and was flown to Hu·∫ø, where the pro-Thi and pro-Buddhist elements were still in control. ƒê√≠nh was then formally replaced by General Cao.Topmiller, p. 86. Walt's assistance to ƒê√≠nh provoked a reaction from General William Westmoreland, the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. Walt and Westmoreland were often in conflict, and the latter responded to his subordinate's evacuation of ƒê√≠nh by imploring K·ª≥ to attack Hu·∫ø. K·ª≥'s surprise attack led to conflict between the ARVN rebels and loyalists, with the American ground forces caught in the middle, effectively creating a civil war within a civil war.Topmiller, pp. 82‚Äì89. K·ª≥ eventually quelled the rebellion and briefly jailed ƒê√≠nh, who claimed he was incarcerated for refusing to back up K·ª≥'s account of the conflict with the Buddhists.Topmiller, pp. 140‚Äì41. ƒê√≠nh left the army and upon the nominal restoration of civilian rule, won election to the newly created Senate in 1967, as part of the Hoa Sen (Lotus) ticket. He was the Chairman of Senate Defence Committee and served as a senator until the fall of Saigon in 1975, later serving as the leader of the X√£ H·ªôi D√¢n Ch·ªß (Social Democratic) bloc. In February 1968, while serving in the Senate, ƒê√≠nh and fellow senator and former junta colleague ƒê√¥n founded a newspaper, C√¥ng Luan,Lent, p. 250. while also serving as head of the Vietnamese Publishers Association.Isaacs, p. 337. On April 29, a day before the fall of Saigon, ƒê√≠nh left for the US, initially settling in Virginia, before relocating to Garden Grove and then Westminster, in the Little Saigon area of Orange County, California. In 1998, ƒê√≠nh claimed he felt remorse for the deposal and assassinations of the Ng√¥ brothers, and also claimed he had opposed their policies of religious discrimination against Buddhists, which had fomented national disunity and the eventual Communist victory.Wright, p. 42. In 1998, his memoirs 20 NƒÉm Binh Nghi·ªáp ‚Äì H·ªìi K√Ω c·ªßa T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh (Vietnamese: 20 Years in the Military ‚Äì The Memoirs of T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh) were published, but they were not launched for another 15 years until June 2013 at an event in Santa Ana that commemorated with the 50th anniversary of the self-immolation of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c during the Buddhist crisis. ƒê√≠nh gave the keynote address at the event, which was organized and attended by several senior members of the Vietnamese American Buddhist sangha. He died at Kindred Hospital Santa Ana on November 21, 2013, where he had been treated for several weeks, and his funeral was conducted in accordance with Buddhist tradition.

As more women became college educated and entered the work force, they began to create new health fields, such as lactation consultation. Today, there are lactivists, women and men who actively promote the health benefits of breastfeeding for mothers, babies and communities, and who protest companies and corporations who discriminate against breastfeeding women. With the development of the internet, individual women can share their breastfeeding experiences, sites can be created that address medical issues, research can be shared throughout the world, and governments can promote breastfeeding as a tool to improve the general health of their entire populations. This list starts small, with the names of the founders of La Leche League, and then links to articles about the most well- known writers and researchers in the field of breastfeeding today. It includes the most authoritative sites with breastfeeding information, and some smaller sites that address important aspects of breastfeeding. The world health community encourages breastfeeding with sites aimed at a national and international audience.

The method consists of first rewriting the equations as a system of differential equations that are first-order in time, by introducing additional variables. The original and the new variables form a vector in the phase space. The solution then becomes a curve in the phase space, parametrized by time. The curve is usually called a trajectory or an orbit. The (vector) differential equation is reformulated as a geometrical description of the curve, that is, as a differential equation in terms of the phase space variables only, without the original time parametrization. Finally, a solution in the phase space is transformed back into the original setting. The phase space method is used widely in physics.

Roman Hippodrome of Beirut The Roman Hippodrome, which occupies 3500 m¬≤ near the Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Wadi Abu Jamil, the historic, Jewish quarter of Beirut, was discovered in 1988.http://stateofmind13.com/2012/03/18/save-beiruts-heritage-the-roman- hippodrome-to-be-demolished/ The Roman Hippodrome of Beirut was the second to be discovered in Lebanon after the Tyre Hippodrome, making Lebanon home to two of the five known Roman hippodromes in the Levant, the other three being in Caesarea in Israel, Jerash in Jordan, and Bosra in Syria. The Roman Hippodrome of Beirut is considered to have been the grandest of the five, having amphitheaters that are several meters high and a race track, which is more than 90 meters long. Preservation In 2009, Culture Minister Tamam Salam, had the site listed officially in the general inventory of historic buildings, ruling that it should be preserved in situ and turned into a tourist landmark. According to an article appearing in the French daily, L'Orient-Le Jour, Gaby Layoun, the Culture Minister at the time, approved in March 2012 plans for a luxury residential complex to be built over the ruins of Beirut's Roman Hippodrome, bypassing the recommendations of three of his predecessors: Tarek Mitri, Salim Ward√©, and Tammam Salam. The three previous Culture Ministers, Mitri, Ward√©, and Salam criticized Layoun's move and reiterated the importance of protecting and preserving the archeological site. A march to protest the destruction of the hippodrome took place on March 24, 2012.https://www.facebook.com/events/395461473816530/ The Association for the Protection of the Lebanese Heritage (APLH) organized the protest as an attempt to reverse the Culture Ministry's decision to allow the building over the hippodrome. Following the litigation brought by the Association for the Protection of Lebanese Heritage (APLH), the court suspended on May 31, 2012 the Culture Ministry's decision, NÀö 849, to dismantle the Roman Hippodrome that would have allowed for the construction of a building project on the site. The site is protected for now. Hippodrome du parc de Beyrouth The current Hippodrome du parc de Beyrouth is a horse-racing facility in Beirut's Horsh district adjacent to Badaro. In 1893 the ‚Äúal-Marmah‚Äù hippodrome was founded, in the town of Bir Hassan. Wealthy Beirutis wished to create a club- complex that included a western style hippodrome and casino. In 1916, the wali of Beirut Azmi Bey, who supported the club project, entrusted its creation to Alfred Sursock, who financed the project. Sursock signed an agreement with the municipality of Beirut for the redevelopment of 600,000 square meters of Beirut pine forest. The project was to include a public causeway, a cinema, a casino, and the hippodrome. The hippodrome was completed in 1921 by Amine and Bahjat Abdelnour while the casino structure became the seat of the French mandate authorities in Lebanon.Mannheim, Ivan.

Woodrell coined the phrase \\"country noir\\" to describe his 1996 novel Give Us a Kiss. Reviewers have frequently since used the term to categorize his writing. (For one example of \\"country noir\\" used in a later review.) Early life and education Woodrell was born in Springfield, Missouri, (for birth date and location) in the southwestern corner of the state. He grew up in Missouri and dropped out of high school to join the Marines. Later he earned a BA from the University of Kansas and an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The University of Missouri Kansas City awarded an honorary doctorate to Daniel Woodrell on December 17, 2016. Marriage and family He lives in West Plains, Missouri in the Ozarks, and is married to the novelist Katie Estill. Career Woodrell has set most of his eight novels in the Missouri Ozarks, a landscape which he knew from childhood. He has created novels based on crime, a style he termed \\"country noir\\", a phrase which has been adopted by commentators on his work. However, William Boyle, an avowed fan and fellow author of literary crime fiction, put Woodrell's work in broader context: \\"this Woodrell guy‚Äôs got double of everything. Language, plot, dialogue, sense of place, energy, tension...He‚Äôs interested in the whole of humanity through the lens of his place.\\" In addition to finding readers for his fiction, Woodrell has had three novels adapted for films. Woodrell's second novel, Woe to Live On (1987), was adapted for the 1999 film Ride with the Devil, directed by Ang Lee. Winter's Bone (2006) was adapted by writer and director Debra Granik for a film of the same title, released commercially in June 2010 after winning two awards at the Sundance Film Festival, including the Grand Jury Prize for a dramatic film. Several critics called it one of the best films of the year and an American classic, and it received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Tomato Red (1998) was adapted for a 2017 feature film by Irish writer and director Juanita Wilson. This was released in Ireland in March of 2017 and went on to be nominated for four awards at that year's Irish Film & Television Awards, including Best Film.

It is a tourist destination and conservation area particularly notable as a refuge for the endangered Indian one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), hosting the largest population of wild Indian one-horned Rhinoceros in the world. The park contains significant stock of three other large herbivores -- the Asian Elephant, the Asiatic Water Buffalo and the eastern subspecies of the Swamp Deer. Kaziranga also has the highest density of tiger in the world and is declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International for conservation of avifaunal species. Wildlife wing of Forest department, Government of Assam is mainly responsible for the administration and management of Kaziranga. However the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India manages the park in the central level along with Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) in the regional level. Kaziranga National Park receives funds from Central Government and State Government under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Central Government provide fund for development of infrastructure and eco-development. The park also receives fund under the Project Elephant from the Central Government. The State Government funds the park for conservation of rhinos in Assam (under R.C. Scheme), development and management of the park and control of poaching. Most of this funding is used in paying wages and salaries of the staff and in anti-poaching measures, only a little sum is left behind for the development of the park. In spite of the funding from the government the park faces shortage of fund. The park received a total of US$ 100,000 in 1997 and 1998 under Technical Co-operation for Security Reinforcement scheme from the World Heritage Fund. The park also receives minor monetary help from various national and international NGOs. There is a plan to generate fund by the money received from the tourist. Every year an Annual Plan of Operation is prepared based on which funding is done. The administrative headquarters of the park is at Bokakhat. The park is led by a Conservator level officer as its Director. A Divisional Forest Officer is the administrative chief executive of the park. There are two Assistant Conservator of Forests and four range forest officers heading park ranges at Ghorakati (Burapahar Range), Baguri (Baguri Range), Kohora (Central Range) and Agoratoli (Eastern Range) respectively. The park is further divided into beats (headed by a forester) and sub beats (headed by forest guard) for administrative purposes. There are three dirt tracks inside the park corresponding to the three forest ranges of the park for patrolling and to view wildlife by the tourists. The Central or Kaziranga range with Kohora as the entry point covers the Daglang and Foliomari area. Some part of this range is the Core Zone of the Tiger Reserve or a Strict Nature Reserve, where casual visitors are not permitted. The Western range has Baguri as the entry point and covers the Monabeel, Bimoli, Kanchanjuri areas. This range is preferred for seeing big game like rhinos and water buffaloes. The Eastern range with Agortoli as the entry point covers Sohola and Rangamatia. This is from Kohora and is preferred for birding. Employment Tourism benefits the people living in the fringe of the park and helps in empowering the local people. About 35 hotels or lodges of various kinds located just outside the park, out of these, four are run by the government. A total of 299 local people are actively employed in these hotels. But, a very few hotels/lodges are owned by the local people. However, some families are offering home stay facilities just outside the park, so that the tourist may get a taste of the local life. People from the adjoining areas own 70 vehicles, which are allowed to be taken into the park, and most of them act as the driver cum guide. On the highway 37, which cuts across the park, 12 local community members own and run public phone booths. There are also 26 shops selling souvenirs etc. that are owned and/or managed by local community members. Many local women also regularly perform traditional dances at some of the larger hotels. Many sell locally handmade woven cloth to the tourist, which act as a money churner. There is tremendous scope for the sale of handicrafts in and around the park. Existing Self Help Groups (SHG) could very well provide a platform for such mechanisms. The Ministry of Tourism, Government of India along with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are jointly supporting rural tourism in village of Durgapur, which falls in the periphery of the Kohora range of Kaziranga along with other initiatives at 31 sites across India. Local people do get some amount of employment from the park in the form of labour and allied activities. Labour requirements for the park include, labour for anti poaching activities and construction of bridges, culverts, etc. Approximately 100 to 200 people are hired per range for removal of Mimosa, a weed which is harmful for the herbivores. The park authorities have also hired15 local people as security guard to protect the tourist jeeps inside the park. The park has developed a very good network of intelligence throughout the villages surrounding the park. There are key informants in every village, which reports about the movement of poachers and are monetarily compensated for information they provide to the park authorities.

With its women-centred savings collectives at the heart of its practice in 34 countries SDI is forging a new system of community organizing that runs in an unbroken thread from the household to the settlement, from the settlement to the city, from the city to the country and from the country to the global stage.\\" Support SDI works closely with the following international agencies: UN Habitat (especially its Global Land Tools Network Program, where SDI co-chairs its International Advisory Board); Cities Alliance (SDI currently serves on its Executive Committee;http://www.citiesalliance.org/exco-reports Union of Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) with whom it has launched the high-profile Know Your City campaign.; the Santa Fe Institute with whom it is developing a data platform of informal settlement information. SDI has an advisory board made up of slum dwellers from India, Philippines, Kenya and South Africa, housing or urban development Ministers or high officials from South Africa, Uganda, India, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Norway and Sweden. SDI'S commitment to work with local and national Governments, bi-lateral and multi-lateral agencies is based on the principal of militant negotiations. This approach comes from a perspective that the problem of urban poverty cannot be addressed at scale without direct collaboration between organised communities of the urban poor and formal actors in the sector, especially local Governments. However certain human rights activists and academics have interpreted this as proof of co-optation by state institutions and international agencies and undermining more rights- based radical social movements.Marie Huchzermeyer, (2011).Cities with ‚ÄòSlums‚Äô: From Informal Settlement Eradication to a Right To The City In Africa University of Cape Town Press, Cape Town To underscore this critique reference is made to SDI's links to these formal institutions and not to its practice and its outcomes. This includes claims that SDI is supported by a number of prominent World Bank intellectuals such as Arjun Appadurai.Culture & Public Action edited by Vijay Rao & Michael Walton, World Bank, 2004, Washington Its role on agencies such as Cities Alliance is also cited as proof of a neo- liberal orientation. Financial support for SDI projects, trans-national learning, global advocacy and the Urban Poor Fund International (UPFI) comes from community savings as well as a range of international donors including but not limited to; Swedish Sida, MFA Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation, Misereor and the Skoll Foundation. Solidarity As a network of networks of communities of the urban poor, SDI is committed to grassroots solidarity at the global and the national levels.SDI Annual Report 2012-13 It has partnerships and memoranda of understanding with Habitat for Humanity, and the Association of African Planning Schools. It retains cordial links with other international networks such as WIEGO and the Huairou Commission. In October 2009, SDI made a statement in solidarity with Abahlali baseMjondolo when a militia affiliated with the ANC attacked the movement in Kennedy Road informal settlement in Durban. Prior to this SDI was accused of supporting the controversial KwaZulu- Natal Elimination and Prevention of Re-emergence of Slums Act, 2007. SDI responded that their working partnership with the Provincial government and the housing department did not mean it supported the Act. 'Know Your City' campaign Know Your City brought together slum dwellers and local governments in 103 cities across Africa, Asia and Latin America, covering 1,238 settlements to partner in community-led slum profiling and mapping. Professor Jos√© Lobo, scientist at Arizona State University and author of a report for the campaign said in 2018: \\"Slums are not undifferentiated seas of poverty and misery, nor are they ‚Äòproblems‚Äô to be fixed. There is a lot of knowledge within poor communities everywhere, and even financial resources to be tapped into (think of savings associations) if the residents are allowed to be involved in the design and implementation of solutions.\\" Researchers from the University of Chicago, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Sam Houston State University and the Santa Fe Institute were also involved.

Primary characters=Dilbert The main character in the strip, Dilbert is a stereotypical technically-minded single male. Prior to October 2014, he was usually wearing a white dress shirt, black trousers and a red- and-black striped tie that inexplicably curves upward; since then, he has worn a red polo shirt with a name badge on a lanyard around his neck. Dilbert received his master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT; he understands engineering well and has good ideas, but has a poor social life. Neither attractive nor blessed with tremendous social graces, Dilbert is capable, but ignored at work and struggles with his romantic life. While he is frequently seen having dates with eligible women, his dates almost invariably end in disaster, usually in surreal and bizarre ways. Dilbert loves computers and technology and will spend much of his free time playing with such things. He had a girlfriend named Liz for a little over two years, but she started dating other men, stating that she will still date Dilbert, but date other men at the same time. Pointy-haired Boss The oblivious manager of Dilbert and the other engineers,Search Results for The Boss and sometimes the main antagonist of the strip; his real name is never mentioned. Scott Adams states that he never named him so that people can imagine him to be their boss. First mentioned on 20th April 1989,Dilbert Comic Strip on 1989-04-20 he was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager with jowls;Dilbert Comic Strip on 1989-07-31 it was not until 21st October 1991Dilbert Comic Strip on 1991-10-21 that he developed his signature \\"pointy hair\\" and the jowls disappeared. He is hopelessly incompetent at management, and often tries to compensate for his lack of skills with countless group therapy sessions and business strategies which usually never bear fruit. He does not understand technical issues but always tries to disguise this, usually by using buzzwords he also does not understand. The Boss treats his employees alternately with enthusiasm or neglect; he often uses them to his own ends regardless of the consequences to them. Adams himself wrote that \\"He's not sadistic, just uncaring\\". His level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs. His utter lack of consistent business ethics, however, is perfectly consistent. His brother is a demon named \\"Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light\\", and according to Adams, the pointy hair is intended to remind one of devil's horns. Wally One of the oldest engineers, Wally was originally a worker trying to get fired to get a severance package. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He often carries a cup of coffee, calmly sipping from it even in the midst of chaos or office-shaking revelations. Wally is extremely cynical. He is even more socially inept than Dilbert (though far less self-aware of the fact), and references to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon. Like the Pointy- Haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work. Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie. Adams has stated that Wally was based on a Pacific Bell coworker of his who was interested in a generous employee buy-out program‚Äîfor the company's worst employees. This had the effect of causing this man‚Äîwhom Adams describes as \\"one of the more brilliant people I've met\\"‚Äîto work hard at being incompetent, rude, and generally poor at his job to qualify for the buy-out program. Adams has said that this inspired the basic laziness and amorality of Wally's character. Despite these personality traits, Wally is accepted as part of Dilbert, Ted, Alice, and Asok's clique. Although his relationship with Alice is often antagonistic and Dilbert occasionally denies being his friend, their actions show at least a certain acceptance of him. He has openly admitted that all his good ideas are about coffee, that sometimes include sabotaging rival companies coffee so they only have decaf. Alice One of the more competent engineers. She is often frustrated at her work, because she does not get proper recognition, which she believes is because she is female, though in reality it is likely because she has a quick, often violent temper, sometimes putting her \\"Fist of Death\\" to use, even with the Pointy-Haired Boss. Dogbert Dilbert's anthropomorphic pet dog is the smartest dog on Earth. Dogbert is a megalomaniac intellectual dog, planning to one day conquer the world. He once succeeded, but became bored with the ensuing peace, and quit. Often seen in high-ranking consultant or technical support jobs, he constantly abuses his power and fools the management of Dilbert's company, though considering the intelligence of the company's management in general and Dilbert's boss in particular, this is not very hard to do. He also enjoys pulling scams on unsuspecting, and usually dull customers to steal their money. However, despite Dogbert's cynical exterior, he has been known to pull his master out of some tight jams. Dogbert's nature as a pet was more emphasized during the earlier years of the strip; as the strip progressed, references to his acting like a dog became less common, although he still wags his tail when he perpetrates his scams. When an older Dilbert arrives while time-traveling from the future, he refers to Dogbert as \\"majesty\\", indicating that Dogbert will one day indeed rule the world...again, and make worshipping him retroactive so he could boss around time travelers. Asok A young intern, he works very hard but does not always get proper recognition. Asok is intensely intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his optimistic illusions becomes frequent comic fodder. He is Indian, and has graduated from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). The other workers, especially the boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs. On the occasions when Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored. His test scores (a perfect 1600 on the old SAT) and his IQ of 240 show that he is the smartest member of the engineering team. Nonetheless he is often called upon by the Boss to do odd jobs, and in meetings his ideas are usually left hanging. He is also seen regularly at the lunch table with Wally and Dilbert, experiencing jarring realizations of the nature of corporate life. There are a few jokes about his psychic powers, which he learned at the IIT. Yet despite his intelligence, ethics and mystical powers, Asok sometimes takes advice from Wally in the arts of laziness, and from Dilbert in surviving the office. As of February 7, 2014, Asok is officially gay, which never impacts any storylines but merely commemorates a decision by the Indian Supreme Court to uphold an anti-gay law.http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2014-02-07/ Ted An engineer who is often seen hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, but he is still seen occasionally now. He is a friend of Dilbert and Wally, but is not seen interacting with Alice or Asok as much. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed down a flight of stairs and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and kids who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Scott Adams refers to him as Ted the Generic Guy because whenever Scott needs to fire or kill someone, he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character. Ted appears in an episode of the series \\"Y2K\\", and is mentioned in \\"the Little People\\". Secondary characters=Loud Howard Another coworker who became a regular character in the TV series, despite appearing in just a few comic strips on 21 April 1995 and 17 March 2006, and again by popular request on 11 October 2006. Loud Howard is incapable of speaking quietly, and in the TV series his overpowering voice often breaks anything and everything around him, including people's eardrums. It has also shattered glass, caused his fillings to vibrate so hard they fall out of his teeth, slammed people against the wall and rendered his sneezes powerful enough to strip a person's flesh from their bones. He lives by an airport, which likely accounts for his loud voice. In the strips, his loud voice is represented by huge lettering and his comically huge mouth (when talking), which takes up most of the available panel space and is therefore difficult to sustain as a running joke. Howard as a recurring character is better-suited to the animated series, where his voice actor, Jim Wise, can speak as loudly as necessary. Loud Howard made a reappearance on May 24, 2012, where he meets Topper and they both have a shouting match right outside Dilbert's cubicle. Carol The bitter secretary of the Pointy-Haired Boss, who hates her boss and all of her co-workers. Initially a minor character in the strip, her character grew enough in popularity over the years that Adams started creating complete storylines for her. Her character was based on all the bad experiences Adams ever had with any secretary.Adams, Scott: Seven Years of Highly Defective People, page 227. Andrews McMeel Publishing, 1997. Several strips feature Carol menacing or attacking co-workers with a crossbow. Carol frequently attempts to put the Pointy-haired boss in situations where he will be killed; she states this to the boss directly on numerous occasions. She has, for example: encouraged him to buy a build-it-yourself helicopter kit; scheduled his business trips via third world countries experiencing rebel insurrections; caused him to crash his car by sending him texts marked 'crisis' so that he will answer them while driving; scheduled 'walking meetings' so that his lack of physical coordination may cause self-injury, for example by falling off a bridge. Carol's two young, poorly behaved children also make appearances in the strip. She is voiced by Tress MacNeille in the animated TV series. Ratbert A rat formerly used as a laboratory test animal. A cheerful character and something of a nitwit though he does make the occasional brilliant observation. He usually gets all the lowest jobs but has been seen as a consultant before. He has made the pointy-haired boss fall under his consultant spell. Dilbert originally disliked Ratbert for being a rat, but Ratbert is later accepted as a member of the family. He was not originally intended as a regular character, but because of his popularity with readers he was kept. Catbert The company's evil feline Human Resources director. Although he was originally just supposed to be around for a few strips, the fans named him and demanded more of him. He derives pleasure from seeing employees worry about their jobs, and particularly enjoys tormenting Wally. Merely mentioning the term \\"layoffs\\" causes him to purr with delight. Unlike Dogbert, Catbert has no apparent owner, but retains all of the qualities of a cat, and frequently purrs or sheds or performs other acts of \\"catness\\", which he uses to torture the employees. He is particularly cooperative and friendly with the Pointy Haired Boss. Dilbert's mother Dilbert's mother (known by fans as \\"Dilmom\\") is a homely and intelligent woman. She used to think Dilbert worked at a railroad because he is an engineer. She is often selfish and openly uncaring towards her son; in the TV series she states that, although she loves him, she does not actually like him (but she does like Dogbert). The comic often shows her and her son passive-aggressively attempting to get out of seeing each other. She has nearly the same level of technical knowledge as Dilbert, although she has him do technical work for her. She is obsessed with Scrabble and has been accused of cheating with \\"counterfeit vowels\\". (This is a reference to Scott Adams' own mother.) She is voiced by Jackie Hoffman in the TV series. Her husband has been missing for years, at a 24-hour \\"All-You- Can-Eat\\" restaurant in the local mall (he will not leave until it is all he can eat); in the animated series, she was touched by a surveillance video of him, given to her by Dilbert and Dogbert. Dilbert's mother's name appears in the April 12, 2006Dilbert comic strip for April 12, 2006 and the May 31, 2009 Dilbert comic strip for May 31, 2009 strips. She is also called \\"Dilmom\\" in the TV series episode \\"Hunger\\", by Dogbert and later a TV announcer. Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light A parody of Satan (the \\"Prince of Darkness\\"), Phil (\\"Prince of Insufficient Light and Supreme Ruler of Heck\\") is a minor demon who punishes people for small crimes by \\"darning them to heck\\" with his \\"pitch-spoon\\". Such crimes include using copier paper for the printer, stealing a chair from another cubicle, and finishing off the last coffee from the coffee maker without making another pot. As a minor demon, Phil's punishments are annoying, rather than tormenting, such as being forced to sit at a secretary's desk and be teased by coworkers, or being forced to sit among the accountants at lunchtime and listen to their boring conversations, or, in one strip, \\"using the spoon\\" (which involved spooning with said person). Phil was eventually revealed to be the Pointy-Haired Boss's brother. Adams is inconsistent with his depictions of Phil, who sometimes has horns and sometimes does not, and sometimes carries a pitchfork rather than a spoon. Adams has stated that the inconsistency is because he sometimes forgets that Phil is not supposed to have a cape or a pitchfork. Bob the Dinosaur A vegetarian dinosaur who tries to avoid using modern technology and seems proud of his low-tech lifestyle. He was found after Dilbert calculated that dinosaurs could not be extinct, and they therefore must be in hiding. Bob was found hidden behind the couch. Bob has a wife (Dawn) and son (Rex), who also live in Dilbert's house, but they are seen far less frequently than he is, since most of his time is spent at Dilbert's office, where his wedgie duty is constantly needed while working with incompetent co-workers, salesmen, or clients. He has also revealed that (being a dinosaur), he is of course mistaken for a COBOL programmer. Bob likes to nap and gobble carrots. Bob appears in the intro of the series and the episode \\"The Little People\\". Mister Garbage Man Dilbert's garbageman is frequently described in the comic as \\"the world's smartest garbageman\\". He appears for the first time in the strip of December 5, 1989. He occasionally solves extremely complex problems for Dilbert and in various strips has developed several futuristic inventions. He once returned Dilbert from the dead by repairing the cloning device that Dilbert had thrown into the garbage. In the TV show, it is revealed that he is the only garbageman for the whole city and is able to collect for all houses through \\"shortcuts\\" (i.e. wormholes). Tina Tina is a technical writer who was introduced both to add more females to the cast and to satirize the technical writing profession of the late 20th century. Tina was portrayed as a frustrated feminist, always on the defensive about her skills and her value to the company.Before the late 20th century, technical writing was dominated by males writing to military specifications. These \\"MIL- SPEC\\" writers gave way to a mixed environment in the late 20th century, when writers began to address the needs of personal computer users. Thereafter, the profession became more gender balanced. She never appears in the TV series, but she appears in some of the animated shorts. Company Lawyer The company's lawyer. He claims he could have been in almost any legal profession, yet still ended up there. The Pointy Haired Boss uses his bitterness to shut down any project he dislikes. Elbonians People from a fictional Fourth World nation, used as a parody of outsourcing. Their culture is radically different from Western culture, and their patriarchy often annoys Alice. Their country is covered in waist-deep mud which they keep wet using expensive bottled water, as revealed in one strip. The main vehicle of their national airline is essentially a giant slingshot. At one point, the French declared war on Elbonia because they tried to launch a satellite with the town slingshot, thereby flattening the French Embassy before Dilbert can intercede; Elbonia ultimately benefited from the war, because the sale of pieces of French bombs became a significant part of the national income. At another time Dogbert lobbied Switzerland to \\"liberate\\" Elbonia's oil. Dogbert once became the king of Elbonia, but Dilbert convinced him to abdicate. Elbonia was first described as an Eastern European nation that had recently overthrown communist rule. Scott Adams stated in Seven Years of Highly Defective People that Elbonia was created to allow for a foreign nation inoffensive to people outside the United States, and is based on the average American's perception of any country without cable television. Accounting trolls Sadistic trolls from the accounting department whose bodies are 95% saliva. As Dogbert shows, their brains are so hard-wired that seeing someone wearing a baseball cap backwards causes their heads to explode (which he called \\"paradigm shifting without a clutch\\"). The trolls' accounting offices resemble a cavernous Hell. They were originally ruled by a witch who turned Dilbert into an accounting troll, but was destroyed when Dilbert, assigned to budget erasing, erased the accounting department's budget. The trolls are rarely given names, but occasionally a troll by the name Nordlaw is referenced. The first troll introduced in the comics was named Bradley. Their original name was Erv. Minor recurring characters=Ming \\"Web Mistress\\", occasionally dates Mordac Mother Nature The ruler of the Earth, who judges the characters (usually Dilbert) about how they treat nature. Dilbert's Ego A tiny being in Dilbert's body. Mordac A senior system/network administrator or manager at Dilbert's company, Mordac the Preventer of Information Services (also known as Mordac the Refuser) strives to make the use of the company's computing resources as difficult and frustrating as possible. In most cases, the ridiculous or over-the-top restrictions he introduces are explained as in line with the company's IT policy (then again, he might be the one writing that policy). In one strip he claimed to have lost the file containing his job description and that he has been \\"winging it\\" for five years. There have however been cases ‚Äî for instance, when he made obscure changes to the network without testing just before allegedly leaving for a three-week vacation on a Russian submarine above the Arctic Circle ‚Äî when his actions could only be explained by malice. His motives are unclear, although his demeanor suggests he simply takes pleasure using his management and technical powers to make the users of \\"his\\" systems suffer. On one occasion, he was attacked while confronting Dilbert by Catbert, as he had made Catbert's personal printer a shared device. In more recent strips he looks different. He has pointed ears and hairstyle much like a Vulcan. He appeared once with a sidekick, \\"Walter the Budget Man\\", in the \\"Merger\\" episode of the animated series. Here he was voiced by Maurice LaMarche. Topper A relatively frequently recurring character in the strip. Whenever anyone mentions in Topper's earshot any difficult task he or she accomplished, he barges into the conversation with a smug facial expression, exclaiming, \\"That's nothing!\\" He then proceeds to top the other's statement with his own, obviously implausible or downright ridiculous, claim (e.g. insulating his house with cheese, implanting himself with insect organs so he can spin silk, or passing a gallstone so big it became the Secretary of Labor in Clinton's administration). He seems to be genuinely offended when the others express disbelief in his purported exploits. He allegedly cannot start a conversation, as he claims that it \\"ruins his system.\\" Dadbert An unseen character in the comic strip, although he does appear in the animated series, in which his face is hidden in a fashion similar to some of the humans from \\"Tom and Jerry\\" or Wilson from \\"Home Improvement\\". He left the family during a trip to the mall in 1992 (1979 in the TV series) in order to visit a 24-hour all-you-can-eat restaurant. He refuses to leave until he is sure he has had all he can eat. Liz Dilbert's girlfriend from 1994 to 1996. He met her at a soccer game, where she rebounded a ball off his head to score a goal. Liz would constantly taunt Dilbert about their comparative levels of attractiveness and his obsession with technology, though Dilbert always took such comments in stride. Adams admitted in Seven Years of Highly Defective People that \\"Liz never really clicked with me\\", and eventually had her break up with Dilbert, after she started dating other men. She is Dilbert's longest relationship. Scott Adams clarified in a user interview that Dilbert is still a virgin and will remain so for a while. Dawn and Rex Introduced in 1989, Bob and Dawn came into the strip after Dilbert figured out that not all dinosaurs could be extinct. Dawn was Bob's \\"mate.\\" Rex was hatched shortly after the introduction of Bob and Dawn. The two characters appeared much less frequently than Bob and have not been seen in a Dilbert strip since September 20, 1997. The C.E.O. The Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) of the unnamed company that Dilbert works at has been shown to be incompetent to some level (though not as much as the pointy haired boss) and often at meetings makes a desperate attempt to seem like, as the pointy haired boss put it, \\"just plain folk\\". Since 2003, the C.E.O. has been drawn as a young bald man with a big head. The Company Robot The Company's Robot was bought by the pointy haired boss to replace Wally. All it was supposed to do was drink coffee and look at inappropriate Web sites, which Wally admitted was all he did. It was hacked by Dilbert and Wally to make it disgruntled, to make sure Wally kept his job. The robot has appeared on occasion since. Bearded suspender guy An old-style computing guy who likes to reminisce about the old days, he's a UNIX user and software architect to whom both Wally and Alice have taken exception. He has appeared with white, black and brown hair, but all appearances include suspenders. He is widely rumored to be based on computer scientist and cryptographer Igor Faynberg (a Bell Labs Fellow), who admits that this may be the case, but has no memory of having met Scott. Zimbu the Monkey A monkey that works at Dilbert's office, who is always a better employee than Dilbert due to his tail, which enables him to be more productive by using his tail to control the mouse and his hands to type. He appears in the episode \\"Y2K\\" voiced by Tom Kenny.

Although non-member space is limited, the harbor offers excellent protection for small boats during periods of rough weather. The privately dredged entrance channel is narrow and has a reported controlling depth of about 3 feet. There are several private piers inside the entrance. It lies near the town of Hansville, Washington adjacent to a group of subdivisions generally called \\"Driftwood Key\\" or \\"Driftwood Keys\\". The bay was originally dredged from a marshy estuary in 1963 in order to facilitate recreational boat access to Coon Bay and residential development. Prior to the development, it was a private duck and black brant hunting area. Over a dozen subdivisions were eventually platted, with both shoreline and upland residential lots. The area is the location of the \\"Driftwood Key Club\\", which provides its members with access to the private marina, boat launch, swimming pool and clubhouse.

History Eckstein Middle School is part of the Seattle Public School District and located on the border of the Wedgwood and Bryant neighborhoods. It was named after Nathan Eckstein, a Seattle businessman, Seattle School Board member, and onetime director of Seattle Public Schools. The school originally opened as a junior high school in 1950 to 790 students. In 1971, it was changed into a middle school, teaching students in grades six through eight. For many years leading up to 2014, when school boundaries changed, Eckstein's student enrollment was about 1300 students. It now serves about 950 students, over 90 of whom are enrolled in the special education program, and employs 44 certificated teachers. Eckstein is known for its academic program, elective offerings, and award-winning music and technology education programs. In 1998, Richard Riley, the U.S. Secretary of Education, chose to deliver the State of Education address in the school's auditorium.Tamra Fitzpatrick, Jolayne Houtz, Why Riley Picked Eckstein For Speech, Seattle Times, February 16, 1998. Accessed 30 September 2008. The building is a designated city landmark. An urban legend exists among the school that a pool exists on the roof, inspired by a sign in the school where \\"Roof\\" is partially scratched off to read \\"Pool\\".  Music Program = Orchestra  Eckstein has three orchestras. They are the Junior, Intermediate, and Senior Orchestras, as well as a chamber group. taught by Brad Smith. The Senior Orchestra goes on an annual retreat to Icicle Creek Music Center for four days at the beginning of February, as of 2019. The Eckstein orchestra program has won a notable number of awards. Band Program Eckstein has five Bands, not including the Jazz Bands. They are all taught by Cuauhtemoc Escobedo, except for the Beginning Band, which is taught by Jean Marie Kent. Beginning Band is for students beginning in the 6th grade instead of Elementary. Junior Band is for 6th graders, who played band in Elementary school and are at an average skill level for their age. Intermediate Band consists of mostly 7th graders, and usually about 0 to 8 6th graders who are above average skill level. Wind Ensemble is mainly for 8th graders, but less commonly obtains 7th graders and more recently, 6th graders. Jazz Band Eckstein has three jazz bands, two of which meet as a class during the school day, and one of which meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays after school. All three Jazz bands are taught by Moc Escobedo. The Senior Jazz Band attends the Monterey Jazz Festival in Monterey, California, and the Reno Jazz Festival in Nevada.Eckstein Middle School cleans up at Reno Jazz Festival. Their main competition is Hamilton International Middle School Jazz Band.

Company Dredge No. 4, also known as the Pedro Dredge and the Chicken Dredge, was originally owned by the Fairbanks Exploration Company (F.E. Co.), a subsidiary of the United States Smelting Refining & Mining Co. (USSR&M;). It was built by the Yuba Manufacturing Company in California, and was shipped to Pedro Creek north of Fairbanks, Alaska in 1938. It was assembled there, and operated until 1958.

The dredge commenced operations on lower Chicken Creek in September and worked for approximately five months every year thereafter until October 1967, when it produced its final cleanup. In 1998, the 500 ton dredge was moved overland to its current location at the Chicken Gold Camp. In 2006, the dredge was added to the National Register of Historic Places and was opened to the public.

It is notable as being the only film featuring Sudirman Haji Arshad, a successful Malay singer dubbed the \\"Singing Lawyer\\" as he was a law graduate from the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur (an academic background almost unheard of among Malay entertainers). The film is written and directed by Patrick Yeoh, who was notable as being the first non-Malay in several decades to direct a Malay film. The film is unusual for its time, not following the conventional Bollywood influenced formula that typified Malay films of the era. Plot The film is about two young runaway teenagers who meet in the city of Kuala Lumpur after leaving their respective homes in different states. Tookoo (Sudirman) the elder of the two, who was first in the city, \\"adopts\\" Din (Zulzamri) and as their relationship develops, is both big brother and father to Din. And as the film progresses we see how Tookoo dreams of being a successful pop singer, and how he and Din survive in the city, collecting recyclable items for sale. We are touched by what these two teenagers go through in the concrete jungle of the city as they are bullied by gangs who rob them of their hard-earned money, cheated by dishonest employers who do not pay them and traumatised by over-zealous police who arrest Tookoo by mistake. Response The film was panned by a generation of Malay film reviewers accustomed to the typical Malay film format. However, three out of four established film critics in the country voted it the best film of the year in Malaysia in 1983. The film represented Malaysia at two international film festivals. Zulzamri who played the character of Din won the Best Child Actor Award at the Malaysian National Film Festival.

Hoboken, NJ, 1992, p146. To this end it has incorporated the wording of Nusach Edot haMizrach, the prayer book of Sephardi Jews, into certain prayers. Nusach Sefard is used nearly universally by Hasidim, as well as by some other Ashkenazi Jews but has not gained significant acceptance by Sephardi Jews. Some Hasidic dynasties uses their own version of the Nusach Sefard siddur, sometimes with notable divergence between different versions. Prayers and customs Some versions are nearly identical to Nusach Ashkenaz, while others come far closer to Nusach Edot Mizrach: most versions fall somewhere in between. All versions incorporate the customs of Isaac Luria. History It is generally held that every Jew is bound to observe the mitzvot (commandments of Judaism) by following the customs appropriate to his or her family origin. For this reason a number of rabbis disapprove of the adoption of Nusach Sefard by Ashkenazi Jews. However, it was a common kabbalistic belief that the Sephardic rite, especially in the form used by Isaac Luria, had more spiritual potency than the Ashkenazi. Many Eastern Jewish communities, such as the Persian Jews and the Shami Yemenites, accordingly adopted the Sephardic rite with Lurianic additions in preference to their previous traditional rites. In the same way, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries many Kabbalistic groups in Europe adopted the Lurianic-Sephardic rite in preference to the Ashkenazi. This was however the custom of very restricted circles, and did not come into widespread public use until the rise of middle to late 18th-century Hasidism. Luria taught that twelve gates of prayer exists, corresponding to the twelve tribes of ancient Israel (and to the twelve Jewish communities that existed in Safed in his lifetime Joseph Davis, The Reception of the \\"Shul·∏•an 'Arukh\\" and the Formation of Ashkenazic Jewish Identity, AJS Review: Vol. 26, No. 2 (Nov., 2002), pp. 251-276 (26 pages), pages 254-256. Davis writes that the twelve communities had their origins in 'Portugal, Castile, Aragon, Seville, Cordoba, the Maghreb, \\"Italy,\\" Calabria, Apulia, the Arab lands, Germany, and Hungary'.), and that twelve nusachs for Jewish prayer (nasachot ha-tefillah) emanated accordingly. In alteration of this Lurianic concept, especially in 18th/19th-century Hasidic Judaism the claim emerged that, while in general one should keep to one's minhag of origin, the Nusach SefardNusach Sefard is the name for various forms of the Jewish siddurim, designed to reconcile Ashkenazi customs with the (believed original) kabbalistic customs of the Ari. See: Wertheim, Aaron, Law and Custom in Hasidism, Ktav Publishing House, Inc. Hoboken, NJ, 1992, p146. reached a believed \\"thirteenth gate\\" (Shaar ha- Kollel) in Heaven for those who do not know their own tribe. Nusach Sefard, with its variant Nusach Ari, became almost universal among Hasidic Jews, as well as some other Ashkenazi Jews, but has not gained significant acceptance by Sephardi Jews. One consequence of this was that, before the foundation of the State of Israel and in the early years of the State, it was the predominant rite used by Ashkenazim in the Holy Land, with the exception of certain pockets of traditional Lithuanian Jews. One reason for this was that Eretz Yisrael was regarded as part of the Sephardic world, so that it was felt that new immigrants should adapt to the local rite. In recent decades, following the immigration of many Ashkenazi Jews from America, the traditional millennia-old Ashkenazi rite has regained a strong following. Today the various sects and dynasties of Hasidic Judaism each use their own idiosyncratic version of Nusach Sfard. Variants Many Hasidic groups have slightly varying versions. Nusach Maharitz Nusach Maharitz, referring to and originating with Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, is the nusach used by most Dushinsky Hasidim. Their nusach is a mixture of Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sefard, incorporating elements from both almost equally.

It is a national organization which brings together multiple communities and their leaders who live in slum settlements around India. NSDF along with Mahila Milan are one of the oldest members of the Urban Poor Fund International Network. Due to the efforts of NSDF, around 90 buildings and 300 toilet blocks have been constructed in Mumbai, providing houses and sanitation to over 35,000 families.http://upfi.info/partners/implementing/national-slum-dwellers- federation-mahila-milan/ Additionally, around 100 toilet blocks have been constructed in Pune. In the 1980s, NSDF formed an alliance with Mahila Milan and SPARC, and this alliance became the basis for establishing Slum Dwellers International in 1996.HabitatJam: SDI Jockin Arputham In 1999, National Slum Dwellers Federation won the UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award.  Background  The National Slum Dwellers Federation was started after the demolition of the Janata Colony in Mumbai. It was one of the largest slums in Mumbai and had mostly a South Indian population. In 1967, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre gave an eviction notice to all residents to vacate the land. Jockin Arputham, who was 18 years old then, was also a resident. To contest the eviction, the residents had to prove that they were permanent residents and have the right to live there. This colony was formed in 1947 and the rent was anywhere between 50 Indian Paise to 2 Indian Rupees. The documentation proved that this was a permanent settlement and a legal settlement thus the residents were not illegally staying there. By 1970, Jockin was travelling all around Mumbai and India to meet other slum leaders and dwellers to help fight the eviction order. All the activists involved worked to make sure that eviction notices could not be served. However, when the eviction notices were finally ordered, the activists went to the district court and won. The Atomic Energy Commission took it to the High Court and won. Finally, the case was taken to the Supreme Court and the acitivists won. However, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was personally interested in that land and one Supreme Court judge, while speaking to Jockin, mentioned how it is too late to stop the eviction due to the Prime Minister. After a long while, a meeting was conducted with Indira Gandhi and a conclusion was reached that there will be no demolition of the slums without the consultation of the slum dwellers and their leaders. Yet, due to the National Emergency declared by Indira Gandhi, fresh eviction orders were given and an arrest warrant for the slum leaders was also issued. A huge demolition took place and all 70,000 people were moved to Cheetah camp. In 1975, the NSDF was formed and multiple slums around India followed this example and formed their own committees.

The role was created by executive producer Gloria Monty and co-head writer Norma Monty. Duke is introduced as the mysterious owner of a local night club who falls in love with police chief Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). Unbeknownst to the rest of Port Charles, Duke is laundering money for the mob but when his criminal ties cost him Anna, he teams with her ex-husband Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) to bring down the mob. Duke and Anna's romance becomes quite popular among fans achieving supercouple status and rivaling Anna's romance with Robert. In 1987, Duke's feud with the Jerome crime family leads to Anna miscarrying their unborn child. Duke and Anna's story comes to a tragic end in 1989 when Duke is presumed dead. The producers would recast the role with Greg Beecroft as Jonathan Paget who was revealed to be Duke with plastic surgery only for the character to be killed off in 1990 ‚Äì dying in Anna's arms due fan disapproval. In 2012, Buchanan reprised the role of Duke and the recast was retconned as Paget is revealed to be an impostor. However, Duke's return turns out to be a similar ordeal when it is revealed that Anna's longtime foe Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) has been posing as Duke in an attempt to seduce Anna. The real Duke is rescued and reunited with Anna and they soon renew their feud with the Jeromes with Duke teaming up with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) to bring down Julian Jerome (William deVry). Duke is killed off in 2015 thanks to a botched hit on Julian's orders leaving Anna devastated and craving justice. Storylines=1986‚Äì1989 Duke is introduced as a night club owner who is immediately smitten with police chief Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). Having fallen for Anna, Duke is torn between their budding romance and his ties to \\"Operating Tumble Dry\\"‚Äîa money laundering operation for the mafia. The arrival of his associate Damon Grenville (Will Jeffries) puts pressure on Duke to eliminate Anna's fellow officer Frisco Jones (Jack Wagner) who has become suspicious of the operation. Duke maintains his innocence when Frisco and his wife Felicia (Kristina Wagner) skip town after the organization frames her for theft. On the orders of one of his superiors Mr. Big‚ÄîDuke proposes to Anna and she accepts only to break it off when her ex-husband Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) exposes Duke's mob ties. Hoping to distance himself from the underworld, Duke appeals to Mr. Big's boss, fellow Scotland native Angus McKay (Guy Doleman) and Guy assures Duke that he will soon be free to marry Anna. Duke proposes to Anna again only for Grenville to bomb her home leading to Duke making a full confession to Anna's co-chief Burt Ramsey (Bob Hastings) ‚Äì who secretly operates as Mr. Big‚Äîhoping to protect Anna and her daughter Robin (Kimberly McCullough). After he is falsely convicted of Ramsey's shooting and imprisoned, Duke teams up with Robert to expose him. Angus arranges for Duke's escape setting him up to be killed. With Robert's help, Duke fakes his death when he gets shot by Ramsey and returns to bring down Ramsey. The final showdown leaves Duke paralyzed. Duke recovers and is released from prison for his cooperation and he shocks Angus by revealing that they are father and son. In 1987, Duke reconnects with his former flame Sister Camellia (Elizabeth Keifer) who turns out to be Duke's half-sister. Meanwhile, Angus appeals to Duke to help him end the mob war with the Jerome family. Angus commits suicide hoping it will end with him, and makes Duke promise to protect Camellia. During their trip to L'Orleans, Canada for Angus's memorial, Anna becomes suspicious of Duke and Camellia's bond. Though Duke implores her not to dig into their past, Camellia discovers she is not Angus's daughter after all and she leaves the convent and schemes to win Duke for herself by contacting sleazy reporter Mark Carlin (Gary McGurk). Carlin exposes Duke's secret past interrupting his wedding to Anna as he is arrested and hounded by the press. Four years earlier, Duke had covered up the murder of Evan Jerome when Camellia killed him in self-defense and blocked out the traumatic event. After standing trial, Camellia and Duke are acquitted and she leaves town realizing Duke will never love her. The ordeal leads to Anna leaving Duke again. The couple is married in a traditional Scottish wedding on October 19, 1987. In 1988, Anna is kidnapped by Grant Putnam (Brian Patrick Clarke) and a desperate Duke turns to mob kingpin and Evan's father Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod) for help. However, Robert gets to Anna first with Duke witnessing their embrace. Duke struggles to keep his associations with the Jeromes secret but things go awry when Victor's youngest son Julian (Jason Culp) takes a bullet meant for Duke and makes a deathbed request for Duke to help Victor legitimize the mob. Meanwhile, Victor's power hungry daughter Olivia (Tonja Walker) sets out to seduce Duke. Realizing she can't steal Duke away from a pregnant Anna, Olivia decides to kill him by trapping him inside a falling elevator only for Anna to fall victim instead and suffer a miscarriage. To further complicate matters, Anna is falsely accused of trying to kill Olivia and arrested. Anna is acquitted when Victor's illegitimate son Dino (Chris DeRose) is revealed to be the culprit. In 1989, when Duke testifies against the mob, knowing they could retaliate against him and his family, Duke fakes his death in an explosion and goes into witness protection. After Victor's death, assuming the danger has passed, Duke decides to come out of hiding. In late 1989, Jonathan Paget (Greg Beecroft) came to town claiming to be Duke with plastic surgery but he is killed by Julian just as he meets up with Anna in early 1990. 2012‚Äì2015 In 2012, Duke is happily reunited with Anna who pushes him away still shaken by her experience with Faison‚Äîas he'd been masquerading as Duke for months. Meanwhile, Anna is torn between her feelings for Duke and her current lover Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary). Duke gives her space and gets a job working for A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) at ELQ Industries. Anna finally breaks it off with Luke and reunites with Duke; they plan to attend Felicia's wedding to Mac Scorpio (John J. York) only for Duke to be left comatose after he falls into a trap set for Anna by Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) ‚Äì the woman who had helped keep him captive on behalf of Faison. Duke awakens and Anna vows to make her pay. When Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) regains control of the company ELQ leaving Duke unemployed, he instead goes to work for media mogul, Derek Wells (William deVry). Meanwhile, Duke receives word that Julian Jerome is still alive. Duke worries for Anna when she leaves town to find Faison and when he tries to find her, he is taken captive by Faison. Anna rescues him and reunites Duke with a presumed dead Robin. The happiness is short lived as Duke learns that Wells is actually Julian and Duke immediately quits his job. Duke secretly partners up with mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) to bring down Julian once and for all. The alliance puts a strain on Duke and Anna's relationship and Duke quits Sonny's organization but they remain friends and Duke provides Sonny with a false alibi for the night of A. J.'s murder. However, Anna is forced to arrest Duke when his statement is revealed to be false. Duke refuses to turn on Sonny and is sent to Pentonville to await trial. Impressed by Duke's loyalty, Sonny makes a plea deal that sends him to prison and frees Duke and Duke agrees to run Sonny's organization in his absence. Duke and Anna split when he calls out her hypocrisy as she had also stepped outside the law to deal with Faison. Though he pines for Anna, Duke starts dating Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring). Sonny's enforcer Shawn Butler (Sean Blakemore) convinces Duke to hire former Jerome employee Jordan Ashford (Vinessa Antoine). However, Duke is disappointed to learn Jordan is an undercover cop and makes plans to eliminate her. Meanwhile, Lucy breaks up with Duke and encourages him to reunite with Anna. After they dance the tango at the Nurses Ball, Duke and Anna declare their love for each other and make plans to run away together and Duke calls off the hit on Jordan. However, before Duke and Anna can leave town, he falls victim to a botched hit from former enforcer Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise). A wounded Duke manages to meet up with Anna only to die in her arms. Anna vows to avenge Duke and bring down Julian once and for all. In March 2016, Doctor Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen) comes to town and takes an interest in Anna. Anna is shocked when Griffin reveals that he is Duke's son. Development=Creation and casting Buchanan read the story of Christ and the Fat Lady from J. D. Salinger's 1961 novel Franny and Zooey for his initial audition tape. Ian Buchanan, had been working as a model for 10 years before he joined the cast of General Hospital in 1986 as Duke Lavery. Buchanan credited the soap as being his first professional acting gig. Buchanan had previously appeared in an episode of CBS's The Equalizer in a role that featured no dialogue The ordeal left him a bit roughed up with Buchanan questioning if he'd made the right choice to give up modeling for acting. General Hospital would change his mind about acting. Buchanan was doing performance art in New York City when executives from ABC saw one of his performances. Buchanan didn't take the network's interest seriously. \\"It's a leading romantic lead\\" Buchanan said of the original character description. According to Soap Opera Digest, the casting process was quite extensive due to executive producer Gloria Monty being so particular about crafting the role. Aside from the audition sides, Monty insisted that the character wasn't truly developed until after Buchanan was cast. They had auditioned nearly a hundred actors and no one caught Monty's eye. Then Monty heard about Buchanan who had been living in New York at the time though her contacts thought he wouldn't fit because of his lack of acting experience. The agent sent in a tape of Buchanan reading a story as a reference. \\"I just thought, there's a terrific amount of magnetism in it\\" Monty said of Buchanan's audition reel. They brought Buchanan in to audition and he got the job. Though impressed by his reading, what appealed to Monty the most was that Buchanan was an unknown. \\"I have always believed in never bringing on someone who has been seen before\\" she said. Buchanan praised Gloria Monty's for guiding him in creating Duke. \\"If she'd told me everything at once, I'd have had a [nervous] breakdown\\" he said. Monty allowed for the slow development and exploration of Duke's history. \\"She's so intuitive\\" Buchanan said of Monty. \\"She allows me to find things on my own\\" he continued. Characterization Gloria Monty described what she initially looked for in the role to Soap Opera Digest. \\"I was looking for a very rough edge to him. Someone who was physically attractive and someone who had style.\\" Co-head writer Monty's sister, Norma Monty said Duke was conceived to be a \\"nightclub person, on the edge of the old times. A thirties type.\\" Also, [Gloria] Monty intended to cast an actor without an accent. Ian Buchanan would describe Duke as a \\"combination good-guy/bad-guy\\" who very \\"complex.\\" While Buchanan said he himself his own personality presents some complexities, Duke's complexities are more \\"extreme.\\" Buchanan further described Duke as having a \\"Good heart and soul.\\" However, he was \\"corrupted by society.\\" Buchanan said he could never be friends with Duke because \\"He's too unpredictable.\\" \\"Duke's changed as I've gotten more comfortable with my acting\\" Buchanan said in July 1987. He continued, \\"I like the way he's developed. A lot of me goes into him.\\" In an interview with The Newfoundland Herald in 1988, Buchanan his views on Duke. \\"I think he is probably a lot like what I would have been if I had stayed in Scotland.\\" He further described Duke as \\"grumpy, groany, bad tempered\\" and \\"always moody.\\" When asked if Duke was \\"good or bad,\\" Buchanan said, \\"I think he is pretty stupid sometimes.\\" Everyone has those moments though \\"he really means well.\\" Buchanan likened Duke to a modern-day Robin Hood. Duke never does anything that is \\"just evil or bad.\\" He always has a reason for the bad things he does. After his 2012 return, Buchanan described the character as a \\"bad boy who fell in love and then wanted to be a good boy.\\" However, it is always a struggle for Duke. He continued that \\"Duke, was always a little duplicitous.\\" Relationships Finola Hughes portrayed Anna Devane, Duke's only major love interest within the series. Their \\"forbidden love\\" garnered fan support quickly and the duo would achieve supercouple status. The character was conceived by Gloria Monty as a romantic interest for Finola Hughes's Anna Devane. Monty was very picky about Anna's next love interest considering the success or her pairing with Robert Scorpio played by Tristan Rogers. \\"I know Anna needed something a little bigger than life\\" Monty explained to Soap Opera Digest. She continued, \\"Whoever we found had to be on par if not a step better than Scorpio...\\" Had Anna and Duke failed, Norma Monty revealed the backup plan ‚Äì \\"Duke would have become a very bad man... Anna would be a heroine and put him in jail.\\" Anna and Duke found success among fans and critics alike. The romance was very melodramatic as Monty had borrowed from one of her favorite movies, the 1941 film A Woman's Face starring Joan Crawford. Monty said the duo are frequently faced with \\"life-and-death\\" and in contrast to other pairings the relationship is \\"forbidden love\\" which is why it's attractive. Buchanan praised the writing for Anna and Duke. \\"The way they told the love story was like an old movie.\\" While Buchanan admittedly didn't see what the big fuss was about the chemistry between Duke and Anna, he believed it was his great relationship with Hughes off screen that had something to do with the duo's success. \\"I'm very comfortable around her\\" Buchanan said of his co-star. As a newcomer to soaps and acting, Buchanan remarked that \\"Working with Finola is a very high point.\\" He continued, \\"We bound off each other really well because there's a great deal of trust\\" he said of their dynamic. Buchanan later said that while \\"I don't make friends easily\\" Hughes was the exception to the rule. Duke also serves as a father figure to Anna and Robert's young daughter, Robin (Kimberly McCullough). Buchanan appreciated the development of the family unit as opposed to the usual action packed plots. \\"It just could be the start of a new kind of trouble,\\" said Buchanan of the duo's impending nuptials in early 1987. The duo's success provided the writers under executive producer H. Wesley Kenney with the opportunity to further complicate Duke and Anna's romance by having Duke \\"pine\\" for Sister Camellia (Elizabeth Keifer) while always feels a strong connection to her first love and father of her child, Robert. Buchanan wasn't really a fan of the multiple triangles for the couple. Camellia is a woman from Duke's past whom he later learns is his half-sister. According to their backstory, Camellia was in love with Duke and they were unaware of the \\"connection.\\" Wesley Kenney admitted that the undoing of Camellia's paternity was to make fans more comfortable with a potential romance. While, Duke and Anna survive the external threats, there were more obstacles to come. In 1988, the series introduced mob princess Olivia St. John (Tonja Walker) who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Duke away from Anna. Of the ongoing conflict and threats to their relationship, mostly because of how Duke makes a living and his past, Buchanan said \\"If it were real life I think she would have told him to go hell by now.\\" While he tried to accommodate to the stories, Buchanan admitted that he struggled with trying to sell Duke as showing interests in other women. \\"It was hard for [Keifer] and Tonja Walker (Olivia) to get between Finola and I.\\" Departure (1989) In the spring of 1989, it was announced that Buchanan would depart the series to do a play in Europe. Head writer Pat Falken Smith revealed that Buchanan had remained under contract with the series. Falken Smith described Buchanan's departure as a \\"very exciting.\\" To facilitate Buchanan's exit, in story, Duke testifies against mobster Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod) putting himself in danger. As Duke was written out in April 1989 in a \\"heroic blaze of glory\\" presumably killed in an explosion, there were no plans to recast or introduce a new love interest for Anna. In a 2010 interview, Buchanan admitted that at the time, he couldn't imagine staying for decades. \\"I was only there for three years but it seemed like 20 years of my life.\\" In 2007 Buchanan revealed to Soaps in Depth that the question he was asked the most was why did he leave. His response: \\"Well I had to do something.\\" In 2010, Buchanan revealed that sudden changes in writers and producers attributed to his departure. \\"I wasn't experienced enough to roll with it. It was too jarring\\" he admitted. Buchanan also had received offers for other work and his manager advised him to take capitalize on the opportunities while he could. On October 27, 1989, Duke was re-introduced under head writer Gene Palumbo hiding out in a safe house. He soon devises a plan that will allow him to reunite with Anna. \\"Duke's journey back into her life will take some incredible turns\\" Palumbo said. Over the course of seven episodes, Duke undergoes plastic surgery to hide his identity. \\"I never really knew how that played out. I did go back and did several shows wrapped up in bandages with little slits for eyes. I'm not sure what that was about\\" Buchanan said of his brief return in 1989. However, Buchanan's return at the time was to facilitate a recast. When asked about how he felt about the decision to recast in 2010, Buchanan said he initially didn't think much of it, but admitted that upon further reflection, he questioned it. For a couple of episodes, Deke Anderson played the bandaged Duke. There was speculation (as indicated by articles in the Bluefield Daily Telegraph & The Index Journal ) that Anderson could possibly carry on in the role as Lavery.Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Friday, December 8, 1989 ‚Äì SOAP SCOOP, Plastic surgery plots don‚Äôt cut it on soaps Page 76The Index-Journal, Sunday, December 10, 1989 ‚Äì Page 53 Plastic surgery plots don't cut it on soaps Duke returned to the canvas on January 19, 1990, with Greg Beecroft in the role using the alias Jonathan Paget. The decision to recast was only made when Buchanan decided not to renew his contract in the summer of 1989. However, the recast was short lived and Beecroft's character was killed off after only seven weeks.  Return (2012)  While Buchanan went on to do other things, he appeared on several other soaps and in 2007 he said he'd be open to reprising the role but, \\"They never asked me, which was the interesting thing.\\" He described himself as \\"totally open\\" to a return but there had never been a \\"serious\\" discussion about it. On August 23, 2012, Soap Opera Network reported on the rumor of Buchanan returning to the series. Buchanan had just made his final appearance as Ian McAllister on Days of Our Lives. Buchanan responded to fan questions about his return on Twitter with the statement \\"My tweets are sealed.\\" Meanwhile, executive producer Frank Valentini teased a huge surprise for the episode airing on Monday August 27. Ian Buchanan reappeared for the first time in 23 years on August 27, 2012 and the 1990 recast was officially retconned with Paget being scripted as an impostor. \\"I've come to the conclusion that's why nobody can use a cell phone in the studio\\" Buchanan said joking to Soaps in Depth in reference to his top secret return. Buchanan didn't even tell his longtime friend and co-star Finola Hughes that he had visited the studio. Buchanan revealed that he was unaware of the story the writers had planned for him when he agreed to return. Viewers quickly realized that something had gone wrong with Duke as he had become quite un-apologetically evil as Duke had suddenly killed Steve Burton's beloved Jason Morgan. Buchanan was afraid of the fan backlash and hesitant about playing the story because it was far removed from the man viewers had come to know and love. However, even this return proved to be not all it seemed to be. On November 12, Duke was revealed to be in impostor once again as super villain Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) had disguised himself as Duke in an attempt to win Anna's affections. Faison had been holding the real Duke captive in a clinic.  Death (2015)  On March 27, 2015, Michael Logan of TV Guide reported that Buchanan's Duke was once again to be killed off. However, the network did not comment on the decision. The April 13 issue of Soap Opera Digest reported that a \\"back from the death character\\" was soon to be killed off as part of cast cuts. Errol Lewis from Soap Opera Network assumed Buchanan's Duke and General Hospital were the character and soap in question due to Logan's previous report. Leading up to Buchanan's exit, Duke is \\"blinded by vengeance\\" the actor explained. He continued, \\"I think [Duke]'s come to the realization that if you revenge, be prepared to dig two graves.\\" The character is killed off on the May 12, 2015 episode‚Äîthe victim of a botched mob hit. Buchanan's final scenes aired on May 14. \\"I have mixed feelings about it, but it is what it is\\" Buchanan said of his departure. Much like viewers, Buchanan himself went through a grieving process. In praise of the writing, Buchanan said \\"[it] was very good right up until the end.\\" Due to the plot direction, Buchanan admitted that he expected his character to be written out and others seemed to catch on as well before Buchanan finally met with Frank Valentini about the developments. \\"The writing's been on the wall!\\" In reference to Duke's \\"out of character\\" actions prior to his death, Buchanan felt \\"justified\\" because the character had always been a \\"loner.\\" Having lost Anna, Duke didn't have anyone to hold him accountable or expect better from him so he didn't do better. While some viewers questioned Duke's loyalty to fellow mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) over Anna, Buchanan appreciated that the writing actually acknowledged it. In just being the character, without questioning the writing, Buchanan was able to identify Duke's motives for himself ‚Äì \\"Duke wanted to be a man again.\\" Buchanan explained that the process was made much more difficult due to the fact that his co-stars always wanted to discuss it. In May 2016, it was announced that Buchanan would briefly reprise his role as an \\"apparition\\" of Duke in scenes opposite Finola Hughes. While he was happy to be invited back, Buchanan admitted \\"I wasn't quite sure what it meant.\\" Buchanan praised the writing for his return scenes as \\"poignant.\\" He continued, \\"it was a really hectic day because it was a [May] sweeps week, and there were some big stunts going on and some big reveals, but of course it was lovely to be part of it.\\" While Buchanan did not get the chance to work with Matt Cohen who had recently joined the cast as Duke's long lost son, the actor said of the plot twist, \\"I think it's very nice.\\" Buchanan made his final appearance as Duke's ghost on Friday, May 27. The actor described the final scenes in which Duke and Anna share one final dance as \\"a way of him setting [Anna] free to move on with her life.\\" Buchanan returned for one episode on March 8, 2017, when his character appeared as a hallucination of the deranged Olivia St. John (Tonja Walker). Reception The character of Duke Lavery received positive reviews from both viewers and critics. During his three years at General Hospital, Candace Havens described Buchanan as one of daytime's \\"hottest commodities.\\" While comparisons to Tristan Rogers' Scorpio was expected, Buchanan quickly amassed a passionate fan base of his own. According to Geoff Meeker, fans initially did not like Duke but they soon warmed up to him. By 1988, Buchanan had become a \\"sex symbol.\\" In 1987, Soap Opera Digest listed the character of Duke Lavery as one of \\"TV's Sexiest Men.\\" Michael Logan described Duke as General Hospital's \\"sly, sophisticated mob front man.\\" Logan declared that Buchanan became a sensation with his sleek, slick, gangsteresque style.\\" A \\"throwback to the matinee idols of the '30s and '40s.\\" Duke was the first of Anna's love interests to \\"really excite\\" viewers according to Jason Bonderoff. Initial plans to make Duke a villain for Anna to bust were abandoned due to fan response. Not everyone approved of Robert and Anna because he was already with another woman. One fan likened the character to Humphrey Bogart.\\" Bonderoff stated that Duke and Anna were the show's most popular duo since Luke and Laura. Damon L. Jacobs of We Love Soaps declared \\"Duke and Anna were a fan phenomenon.\\" In 1988, Buchanan won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer. He was also nominated for Outstanding Hero Award in 1988. Jamey Giddens listed the Greg Beecroft \\"recast\\" of Duke at No. 4 on his list of \\"Daytime's 10 Most Insane Recast!\\" Soap Opera Digest said it would've been easier to just allow Duke to stay dead instead of \\"reuniting\\" him with Anna only to kill him off again. \\"It was a grizzly, terrifying sight ‚Äì and a monumental shock to the couple's loyal fans.\\" Michael Fairman described Buchanan's return as \\"quite simply a stunner\\" considering the character's history. The news of Duke's reappearance spread rather quickly making headlines everywhere. The revelation became a trending topic on Twitter in the United States, as well as internationally. Sara Bibel said Buchanan's unannounced return was quite the \\"shocker.\\" Soaps in Depth categorized Duke's return as a \\"sudden revelation.\\" TV Source Magazine listed Duke's return, along with several other \\"shocking returns\\" as the reason for General Hospital being the most improved show for the year 2012. Mallory from Serial Drama responded with several expletives and the statement \\"OHMIGOD MY HEAD EXPLODED.\\" In reference to the General Hospital's lackluster surprises, Mallory said \\"I thought this big reveal would be neither large or revelatory but oh my WOW, was I wrong.\\" Of Buchanan's initial return, Connie Passalacqua said \\"I actually screamed! And clapped! Finally, a soap keeping a plot twist secret!\\" Mallory further praised the final reveal that Faison had been masquerading as Duke while holding the real Duke hostage. \\"How freaking great was today's episode? What a payoff!\\" On-Air On-Soaps praised the storyline of Robin's presumed death and return as the Best Storyline of 2012 as it featured the shocking returns of both Faison and Duke. News of the decision to kill off Duke was very poorly received by fans and critics. However, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps suggested that Buchanan's departure could potentially propel story considering how little the character was being used. Errol Lewis from Soap Opera Network said Duke's story was ending too soon. \\"Beyond the fact that Ian Buchanan is a phenomenal actor, Duke is a complex character with several possible story directions ahead.\\" Connie Passalacqua of Marlena De LaCroix said \\"I am stunned.\\" She continued, \\"It is just so wrong!\\" Passalacqua hoped the producers would reconsider the decision.

The group works with issues such as housing, sanitation, and grassroots lending schemes. It aims at gaining women equal recognition for improvement of their communities, while indulging in important decision making activities. The loans granted by the group to its members in times of need, are sanctioned in the name of the woman of the house. Interest on loan is easy. Mahila Milan call the 2% charged levied, a two rupees ‚Äòservice charge‚Äô on every hundred rupees. Their recovery process is quite simple too. The women visit the house of the loan defaulter. If it looks like they really are in no position to return the loan, they give them another loan to get them back on their feet and ensure that with the second loan the family stays afloat. If the man of the house dies or is suddenly bedridden with sickness, they write off the loan. These women, who have seen more than enough of their share of grief, are quick to empathise and act. History Mahila Milan was formed in the 1980s, when the National Slum Dwellers Federation (NSDF) agreed to help create a sister organisation complementary to its own, to encourage more women to enter leadership roles in slum development and poverty alleviation, with the assistance of Sheela Patel and her group SPARC.SDI: India Community-based organizations, Mahila Milan and the National Slum Dwellers Federation (NSDF), alongside the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers (SPARC), have been working together since the mid-1980s to improve the housing situation of pavement dwellers in Byculla, an area in central Mumbai. When these three organizations came together to form what is known as the Alliance, pavement dwellers were amongst the worst of inhabitants in the city. Although physically quite visible on the streets, pavement dwellers were entirely invisible in public policy. They could not obtain ration cards, which are identity cards that grant citizens the right to schooling and access to subsidized food, nor could they gain access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. Pavement dwellers, unlike slum dwellers, were also excluded from electoral rolls and any official census taken in the city and throughout the country. Mahila Milan was formed largely in response to a 1985 Supreme Court ruling that granted the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai authority to demolish household structures on the sidewalks of Mumbai. These were the homes of those known popularly as \\"pavement dwellers\\". Many NGOs and community-based organizations planned mass action to confront these demolitions, however SPARC activists found that women from pavement settlements did not want confrontation and preferred to work out a way to coexist with the rest of the people in the city. A survey carried out by SPARC between July and October of 1985 found that pavement dwellers were not transient populations, but people who had lived for over two decades in the city. This was documented and published in We The Invisible, which detailed the background of these people from the poorest districts of India - victims of underdevelopment, communal violence, floods, famines and other crises. There were no evictions, and by March 1987 Mahila Milan was established to help poor illiterate women in each settlement understand the politics of why they cannot get land in the city for their house, and to develop a strategy to present to the city. In 1992, leaders of the emerging South African Homeless People‚Äôs Federation went to Mumbai to participate in a survey and housing exhibition. This fuelled the participation of Mahila Milan and NSDF leaders to visit Durban. There, they conducted the first training for community leaders from five settlements in Piesang River. What started with a survey, ended with a housing exhibition. The alliance formed by the South African Federation and Mahila Milan, along with federations having similar goals, from more than 30 countries, are now united under the umbrella organisation of Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI). Among their many shared practices and objectives, these central hands- on housing design and development processes continue to explore and promise a sector house in the city. SDI gained much more exposure than ever before in the year 2001 when it took a 36-member international team to New York. at the United Nations governing council meetings, the team built a full-size house model and a community toilet block in the UN building. Although, merely five or six years old, the SDI was on its path to pave a way for the urban poor to gain recognition globally and stake their claim in the global habitat-linked discussions. Members of SDI, were however disappointed as only a few cared about what the urban poor had to say in the formal proceedings. Kofi Annan, then the head of the UN, spent over half an hour with the SDI delegation and, before SDI really understood branding and imagery, the house model exhibition in the UN made it known throughout the global community, as delegation after delegation had its pictures taken in front of the SDI house or toilet model. Programs Assisted by the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC), Mahila Milan runs a number of programs. These include: * Milan Nagar, a cooperative designed to seek alternative siting for their housing; * Opening bank accounts establishing saving schemes to assist women towards purchasing new homes * Providing each family with essential food and clothing * Dealing with crises, such as the provision of emergency loans, or assisting with police-related problems. Crisis credit scheme When six pavement dweller groups completed a project in 1987 building shelter for themselves, they realised they needed more than housing. Therefore they created a crisis credit scheme, in which every person contributes 1 or 2 rupees and anyone can borrow a sum when they need it. One year later Mahila Milan was instructing groups across India on how to set up such a scheme and in 1989 the groups were lending to each other. By 2001, there were 25,000 households in the scheme and 5,000 borrowers. Since most of the women were illiterate, Mahila Milan teaches a system where everyone has a pouch in which different coloured pieces of paper represent their savings. The smallest unit is 15 households, all of which know and trust each other. Each group makes its own decisions about lending. Housing Mahila Milan have been active in advocating the earmarking of vacant land for the homeless, and designing strategy to help the poor into their own homes. The organisation became a model for other NSDF-affiliated organisations between 1985 and 1995, providing principles and frameworks to form the basis of discussions between informal settlements and cities. In 1995, the government of Maharashtra integrated pavement dwellers for the first time into the classifications of households entitled to land for relocation in the Slum Rehabilitation Act.University College London: Department for International Development: Urban Government: Capacity Building: SPARC: Demolitions to Dialogue: Mahila Milan - learning to talk to its city and municipality In Dharavi, Mumbai's biggest slum, women joined Mahila Milan and asked for land to build permanent homes on. They designed and built the houses to suit their budget. Sanitation Mahila Milan negotiates with local administrations for women to be able to build their own sanitation units in their own local area. As of 2016, the group has facilitated the construction of 100 toilet blocks.

It is a horizontal karst cave of Ordovician Nealmont/Benner limestone, estimated to be about 500,000 years old. It is the second-largest cave in Pennsylvania and the largest limestone cave. Indian Caverns consists of two sections, originally separated by a 14-foot wall: the \\"Historic Cave\\" and the \\"Giant's Hall\\". The \\"historic\\" part of the cave is generally low-ceilinged and closer to the surface (as shallow as 15 ft) with a couple of wide rooms and extensive speleothem formation. The Giant's Hall area consists of several large passageways, up to 60 feet high, but with fewer speleothems - though it does include the largest sheet of flowstone in the northeast and a substantial rimstone pool. The lowest point of the cave is approximately 140 feet beneath the surface and the cave temperature is a constant 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius). Artifacts found in the cave indicate that it was inhabited as long ago as 8000 BC. The earliest tribe known to have used the cave were the Susquehannocks, circa 1600 AD. It was later used by Algonkian (including Lenni Lenape) and Iroquois (probably Mohawk) tribes through the early eighteenth century. Examples of the artifacts are on display in the cave and include arrow and spearheads, tobacco pipes, tomahawks, punches, banner stones, a bone flute, and pottery shards. They also include a rare effigy of the Algonkian guardian spirit, Mesingw. One room, the \\"Grotto of the Wah-Wah-Taysee\\", features a phosphorescent mineral deposit in the ceiling and walls. It was originally thought to be radium, but has since been identified as zinc sulfide reacting with calcite in the limestone. The cave also contains a \\"musical rock\\", which resounds with a bell-like tone when struck. Indian Caverns was known about by European settlers from the late eighteenth century. From about 1816, it was one of several caves used as a hideout by the outlaw David Lewis until his death in 1820. The entrance and grounds were bought in 1928 by Harold Wertz, Sr., a local entrepreneur, and the cave was opened to the public on June 14, 1929. Wertz opened the cave after two years of excavation and about half a million dollars worth of investments. Wertz, along with his family, moved to Florida during the great depression, but returned each summer to run and upkeep the caves. Before the Indian relics were found inside the first few chambers in the caverns, the cave was planned to be called \\"Franklin Cave\\", but it seemed more appropriate to be called \\"Historic Indian Cave\\". Then in the late 1930s - early 1940s the name was changed to \\"Indian Caverns\\". It was a popular destination during the Early Auto Era due to the Edwardian fascination with the \\"wonders\\" of nature and remained in continuous operation until 2017. In 2017, the Western Pennsylvania Convervancy purchased the property and is currently in the works of naturalizing the cave (returning it to its original state). The Conservancy plans to use the caverns as a bat sanctuary in the coming years and conduct research on the local bat species.

There are two subspecies, the southern S. s. sibilatrix and the northern S. s. fostersmithi. Description The whistling heron measures 53 to 64 cm in length and weighs 521 to 546 g. The southern subspecies is bigger but has a shorter bill in proportion to the body. The overall impression of standing birds is gray, with flying birds showing conspicuous white rear parts (lower back, belly, and tail). In both subspecies, adults' upperparts except the lower back are blue-gray. The feathers of the sides of head, sides of the neck, breast, and scapular area are basically white but are stained gold to buff, perhaps by the powder down typical of herons or by secretions of the preen gland; the color varies from bird to bird. In the nominate subspecies, the crown and crest (separate plumes up to 4 cm long on the nape) are black and the upper wing coverts are cinnamon-colored; the crown and crest are slate-gray and the upper wing coverts are honey-colored (or \\"chamois\\") in fostersmithi. The bill is pink with blue to violet at the base and the distal third black, the legs are greenish and rather short, and there is a fairly big area of bare bluish skin around the eye. Juveniles have the same overall pattern but are duller than adults, with the crown lighter, the breast light gray, and the throat and sides unstained white. Chicks are undescribed. The bird is named for its most common call, a \\"loud, flute-like whistled kleeer-er\\" or \\"a high, reedy, complaining whistle, often doubled or uttered in a ser[ies], wueeee, wueeee,.‚Ä¶, easily imitated\\" or \\"a distinctive, characteristic, far-carrying, melodious whistle\\" that \\"can be rendered 'kee, kee, kee.'\\" It may also give \\"a slow, drawn-out whistle\\" when taking off. The alarm call is a harsh quah-h-h. Unlike other herons, in flight it has fast, duck-like wingbeats and usually does not retract its neck fully. Range and habitat The subspecies fostersmithi inhabits the Llanos and the Orinoco basin of Colombia and Venezuela. The subspecies sibilatrix inhabits eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, western and southern Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and northeastern Argentina. Recent records suggest that it may be expanding its range northward and eastward in Brazil. It makes seasonal movements at least in northeastern Venezuela, where it does not occur from November to January, but remains all year in other areas, such as Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It occurs at altitudes up to 500 m (with a sight record from 2300 m) in seasonally flooded savanna, often in drier grassy situations than other herons, but also in a wide variety of open waterlogged or shallowly submerged terrain. Because it roosts in trees, it particularly likes regions where open areas are mixed with woodlots. It has no objection to human-altered habitats such as pastures and roadsides, and it often perches on fenceposts. Although patchily distributed, it is common in many areas, with no population considered vulnerable. It benefits from deforestation and some agriculture. As a successful heron of dry tropical country, it has been compared to two species originating in the Old World: the cattle egret and the black-headed heron. Behavior=Feeding This species eats any small dryland and marsh animals it can catch, or even pirate (as from an aplomado falcon in one reported incident). It often holds still but also walks very slowly and may use more active techniques, even running after prey or catching flying insects (notably dragonflies) from a standing position. It may allow humans to approach fairly closely rather than leave a good feeding spot. It typically feeds alone or in pairs, but is sometimes seen in groups up to 100, especially before roosting for the night. Reproduction In a courtship display, the birds fly back and forth and glide in circles. A captive pair displayed by raising their plumes. This species nests alone, unlike most herons, which nest in colonies. It may nest in mature trees such as araucarias or exotic trees. One nest in Argentina was loosely built of sticks about 4m up in a eucalyptus. The eggs are pale blue and speckled, about 4.7 √ó 3.6 cm, and the normal clutch is three or four. Incubation lasts about 28 days, and young fledge 42 days after hatching. Egg survival has been measured at 28% and nestling survival at 40%; storms that destroy nests are an important cause of losses. Based on observations of family groups, only two young normally fledge. Unlike most heron species, whistling herons care for young after leaving the nest; juveniles beg for food by hissing with their wings drooped. Taxonomy Skeletal resemblances to the night herons have led to a debate about whether the whistling heron is related to them, but since the 1980s it has been at least provisionally considered a relative of the genus Egretta, with little doubt that it belongs in a genus of its own. Cultural significance Indigenous peoples formerly used its neck plumes as trade items, though not so heavily as to reduce populations.

It is located in Downtown Pittsburgh at 414 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Built from 1915-17 it is the third seat of government of Pittsburgh. Today the building is occupied mostly by Pittsburgh offices with Allegheny County located in adjacent county facilities. It also contains a courtroom for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania when holding sessions in Pittsburgh. History At the start of the 20th century, City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County officials began to realize that the current structure which housed the city and county government offices was insufficient for the city's rapid growth. The offices at that time were located in the Smithfield Street City Hall building, which was built in 1868-1872. The demand for new offices grew exponentially with the incorporation of Allegheny City into the City of Pittsburgh in 1907, which added 130,000 new residents to the city.Allegheny City: A History of Pittsburgh‚Äôs North Side. Dan Rooney & Carol Peterson. University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. In 1909 plans for a new City Hall began. Mayor William A. McGee proposed selling the current offices in the Smithfield Street City Hall and the Public Safety building, and using these funds to buy the Allegheny County Courthouse and use it as the space for construction of a new City Hall.‚ÄúThe Proposed City-County Building Trade‚Äù. The Pittsburgh Press, November 9, 1909. By 1912 the plans moved forward substantially with both the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County approving a joint venture to purchase the land and both occupy the new building. The architect for the new building was to be chosen through a competition, only accepting architects residing and doing business within Allegheny County.‚ÄúApproved Agreement for City-County Building‚Äù. The Pittsburgh Press, May 22, 1912. Regional favoritism was used in the building's construction as well, as in 1914 Mayor Joseph Armstrong claimed that all material for the building should come from manufactures who produce and are located in Pittsburgh, and that all labor employed should be obtained or taken from Allegheny County.‚ÄúHome Industry Favored‚Äù. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, October 2, 1914. The plans for the development of the new building even extended to some of the prominent organization within Pittsburgh such as the Carnegie Library, and the Civic Club of Allegheny County who both had plans for space in the new building.‚ÄúLarge Civic Center Plan is Announced.‚Äù Pittsburgh Daily Post, February 28, 1914.‚ÄúLibrary Branch Offer‚Äù.

The building was nominated in January 2016 to become a City Historic Site by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  In 1914, a competition was held for a new Pittsburgh City Hall. The 16-entry competition led to the commissioning of Edward B. Lee, a respected Pittsburgh architect, with Palmer, Hornbostel, & Jones as associated architects. The completed design was done by Henry Hornbostel. The building was designed in the Beaux Arts style, with elements of the City Beautiful Movement. The City-County building is a representation of a distinctly American extrapolation of the Beaux Arts mode.Leland Roth, American Architecture, p. 287. Hornbostel was known for this architectural style, and architectural historian James Van Trump has stated that Hornbostel kept the principles of the Beaux Arts central with his designs, but also frequently departed from the precepts, and integrated elements of other styles akin to industrially-inspired brutalism.James Van Trump, Art and Architecture in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, Pittsburgh, Pa., 1985, p.144. The design of the building was also influenced by the City Beautiful Movement. This movement featured urban planning with soaring Neoclassical buildings, clean and orderly designs, and included the concept of the ‚ÄúWhite City‚Äù. The City-County Building was one of Pittsburgh's first attempts at incorporating the City Beautiful Movement into its urban design.Walter Kidney, Henry Hornbostel: An Architect‚Äôs Master Touch, Lanham, Md., Roberts Rinehart Publishers., p.141. Some of the most significant design elements of the building include the Grand Lobby, which is a naturally lit atrium with a 47-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The ceiling is held up by bronze columns crafted by Louis Tiffany Studios. They feature at their bases, the Seals of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, frontiersman Guyasuta, and Pittsburgh's oldest surviving building, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse. The rooms ornate elevator doors feature a series of reliefs detailing the previous homes of municipal government. The reliefs age with the building's they clutch, reaching adulthood with the present City-County Building and Allegheny County Courthouse. The building is also unique in that most of the furniture was designed by the building's architect, Hornbostel. The Office of the Mayor, Council Chamber, and Supreme Court Room all feature 1917 furniture still in use today. On the seventh floor of the building is a massive mural completed in 1940 entitled \\"Justice\\" by award-winning artist Harry Scheuch.

The album was in the hook-filled melodic hard rock/pop metal vein, featuring tight vocal harmonies over a strong rhythm section, guitar, and sweeping synthesizer. Stylistically it was like Europe with a bit more bite. \\"Won't Stop\\" was the album's first single, and the track was also released in an extended 12\\" remix version. The album was almost entirely hard- driving rockers, without the power ballads of many other bands of the genre.

After a decade and a half out of print, the album was re-released on CD by independent label MTM Classix in 2004. The re-release includes lyrics and liner notes, including a new thank-you section. The collection ends with two new bonus tracks. he first, \\"Hardcore Romance\\", is in a rawer style, sans the keyboards prevalent throughout the original '80s recording.

It opened a subsidiary plant again in Birmingham and by the 1950s was the biggest manufacturer of stainless steel cutlery in the country. By the 1990s the company had shifted towards provision, supply and branding, rather than manufacture, of cutlery. It has been owned and managed by five generations of the Price family. Company history Arthur Price has been called a traditional English family-owned company. Arthur Price himself was born on 3 March 1865, and as a young man spent two decades employed in the flatware industry before setting up his own company in Aston, Birmingham, in the name of Arthur Price of England, Master Cutlers & Silversmiths. In 1912 the company was commissioned to supply the top-range of cutlery for 's maiden voyage. The company was adaptable in adverse economic conditions, says Bryson. It successfully adjusted its business strategy during the 1940s and 1950s as both the nature of technology and labour changed and consumerism became a growing influence on manufacturing. In the 1940s, he says it was a \\"factory-led\\" company, in that the company was driven by what it could produce. In contrast, by the following decade, there was a growing shift towards a consumer-driven economy. The difference for Arthur Price was that, in the latter period, the company tailored production to what was wanted. By this time, it had become the largest manufacturer of stainless steel cutlery in Britain, and was the first to use chromium plating in its production. In 1964 John Price (grandson of the founding Price) renamed the firm Arthur Price. By the 1970s the company began focusing on high end, rather than popular, cutlery sets. On the one hand, this emphasised the craft skillset the company possessed but conversely necessitated the introduction of new precision techniques and technologies. In 1971 Arthur Price opened a factory in Saltley, Birmingham. The local Community Development Project expressed itself unsure as to the impact the company would make in the area, as it was employing \\"less than 200 workers, and its position seems very insecure\\". At the same time, John Price launched what David Hey has described as \\"a vigorous marketing campaign\\" which emphasised the exclusivity of the company's designs to British department stores. In 1992 the company began importing products for resale; up until that point, everything sold had been made in Sheffield. This, suggests Bryson, reflected the strained market cutlery manufacturers generally‚Äîand Arthur Price particularly‚Äîwere now operating in. Reflecting the fact that, by now, surveys indicated that most consumers were unwilling to pay more than ¬£100 for a six-person set. Arthur Price's entry into the import market followed their competitors; Simon Price‚Äîthe founder's great- grandson‚Äîsuggested that \\"no leading cutler in Europe was without a lower end of imports\\" at the time, and that his firm was no exception in. As a result, Arthur Price products were formed into two divisions and would be hallmarked and marketed as either International‚Äîthose that were imports‚Äîor of England, if they had been made in Sheffield. By this time, one commentator has observed, the company was in effect \\"not a production facility so much as a service\\", as it manufactured to order, on behalf of hotel chains and kitchen designers. The transformation of Arthur Price from an industrial manufacturer to the mass market, to a service provider to other industries, has been used to illustrate the decline of Britain's manufacturing and the growth of its service industry. As of 2018, the company held a royal warrant to supply the Charles, Prince of Wales and was a member of the Cutlers' Company.

During his institutional academic career he was a Federation Fellow, a President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, founding Director of the Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies at the University of Queensland, and Convenor of the ARC Cultural Research Network. Turner gained a master's degree from Queen's University, Canada, and his doctorate from the University of East Anglia, in the UK. He taught at the Queensland Institute of Technology (now Queensland University of Technology), the West Australian Institute of Technology (now part of Curtin University), and was Professor of Cultural Studies in the English Department at the University of Queensland before becoming the founding Director of the Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies in 1999. He was elected an ordinary member of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1997, and was elected president in 2004. From 2001 until 2004 he was a member of the Expert Advisory Panel for Creative Arts and Humanities of the Australian Research Council. In 2004, Turner was successful in his application for the ARC Cultural Research Network, one of only 24 Research Networks funded by the ARC, while in 2006 he was awarded a Federation Fellowship by the ARC to study \\"Television in the post-broadcast era: The role of old and new media in the formation of national communities\\".ARC Federation Fellowship Project In his speech to the National Press Club (Australia) on 3 September 2008, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon Kim Carr announced that Professor Turner, had been appointed to the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC). This makes Turner the only Humanities scholar on the Council, and only the second since the Council's inception (as the Prime Minister's Science Council) in 1989. Turner is one of the key figures in the development of cultural and media studies in Australia. His work is used in many disciplines: cultural and media studies, communications, history, literary studies, and film and television studies. His over-arching research interests include Australian film and media, issues in Australian nationalism, popular culture, celebrity, talkback radio, audience studies, and the role of television in a post- broadcast era increasingly dominated by new media formats such as the Internet. His current research focuses on the transformation of \\"cultural fields\\". In 2015, the journal Cultural Studies published a special issue \\"commemorating and evaluating the contribution of Graeme Turner to the field\\". Edited by Gerard Goggin, Anna Pertierra and Mark Andrejevic, this issue included contributions by Meaghan Morris, Toby Miller, Frances Bonner, Tony Bennett, John Byron, and Melissa Gregg.

Journal rankings are intended to reflect the place of a journal within its field, the relative difficulty of being published in that journal, and the prestige associated with it. They have been introduced as official research evaluation tools in several countries.  Measures  Traditionally, journal ranking \\"measures\\" or evaluations have been provided simply through institutional lists established by academic leaders or through committee vote. These approaches have been notoriously politicized and inaccurate reflections of actual prestige and quality, as they would often reflect the biases and personal career objectives of those involved in ranking the journals; also causing the problem of highly disparate evaluations across institutions. Also, see YouTube video narrative of this paper at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQIDkA-ke0. Consequently, many institutions have required external sources of evaluation of journal quality. The traditional approach here has been through surveys of leading academics in a given field, but this approach too has potential for bias, though not as profound as that seen with institution-generated lists. Consequently, governments, institutions, and leaders in scientometric research have turned to a litany of observed bibliometric measures on the journal-level that can be used as surrogates for quality and thus eliminate the need for subjective assessment. Consequently, several journal-level metrics have been proposed, most citation-based: * Impact factor ‚Äì reflecting the average number of citations to articles published in science and social science journals. * Eigenfactor ‚Äì a rating of the total importance of a scientific journal according to the number of incoming citations, with citations from highly ranked journals weighted to make a larger contribution to the eigenfactor than those from poorly ranked journals. * SCImago Journal Rank ‚Äì a measure of scientific influence of scholarly journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from. * h-index ‚Äì usually used as a measure of scientific productivity and the scientific impact of an individual scientist, but can also be used to rank journals. ** h5-index ‚Äì this metric, calculated and released by Google Scholar, is based on the h-index of all articles published in a given journal in the last five years. * Expert survey ‚Äì a score reflecting the overall quality or contribution of a journal is based on the results of the survey of active field researchers, practitioners and students (i.e., actual journal contributors or readers), who rank each journal based on specific criteria. * Publication power approach (PPA) ‚Äì the ranking position of each journal is based on the actual publishing behavior of leading tenured academics over an extended time period. As such, the journal's ranking position reflects the frequency at which these scholars published their articles in this journal. * Altmetrics ‚Äì rate journals based on scholarly references added to academic social media sites. * diamScore ‚Äì a measure of scientific influence of academic journals based on recursive citation weighting and the pairwise comparisons between journals. * Source normalized impact per paper (SNIP) ‚Äì a factor released in 2012 by Elsevier based on Scopus to estimate impact. The measure is calculated as SNIP=RIP/(R/M), where RIP=raw impact per paper, R = citation potential and M = median database citation potential. * PageRank ‚Äì in 1976 a recursive impact factor that gives citations from journals with high impact greater weight than citations from low-impact journals was proposed. Such a recursive impact factor resembles Google's PageRank algorithm, though the original paper uses a \\"trade balance\\" approach in which journals score highest when they are often cited but rarely cite other journals; several scholars have proposed related approaches. **The Eigenfactor is another PageRank-type measure of journal influence, with rankings freely available online, along with SCImago. * JRank ‚Äì JournalsRanking (JRank) is the digital portal developed by iMaQ Technologies Pvt. Ltd in 2015 containing list of all international journals indexed in ISI- JCR and Scopus-SJR based on the current impact factor (IF) and Quartiles (Q) given by Thomson Reuters and Scopus, respectively. The JRank also gives detailed information about the journal such as country of journal publishing, impact factor history, frequency of journal publishing, active web link etc. All lists of journals based on subjects can also be viewed using JRank portalList of ISI and Scopus Indexed Journals (2015)\\"\\" * NCPPU (Net cost per paid use): a revised measure of the cost per download in a certain institution, which combines various measures of value; offered by Unpaywall Journals and used by library systems such as the SUNY Libraries Consortium to select the top 248 most useful journals to subscribe to from Elsevier's offering instead of its big deal. Critical reflection Negative consequences of rankings are generally well-documented and relate to the performativity of using journal rankings for performance measurement purposes. For example, McKinnon (2017) has analyzed how the ABS-AJG ranking, which in spite of its methodological shortcomings is widely accepted in British business schools, has had negative consequences for the transportation and logistics management disciplines. Universities now increasingly drop the idea that research quality can be measured based on the uni-dimensional scale of a journal ranking. This has, for example, led to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which has now been signed by thousands of researchers worldwide, asking ‚Äúnot [to] use journal-based metrics [‚Ä¶] as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist‚Äôs contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions‚Äù.https://sfdora.org/ The Community for Responsible Research in Business Management (cRRBM) asks whether ‚Äúeven the academy is being served when faculty members are valued for the quantity and placement of their articles, not for the benefit their research can have for the world‚Äù.https://bized.aacsb.edu/articles/2018/05/the-moral-dilemma-to-business- research National rankings Several national and international rankings of journals exist, e.g.: * ERA Australia journal listsAustralian Research Council ranking of journals worldwide * Brazil's Qualis * Colombia's Publindex * DenmarkDanish Ministry of Higher Education and Science (2014)\\"\\" * Finland's Julkaisufoorumi (JUFO)Publication Forum \\"\\" * Norwegian Scientific Index * Germany VHB Index; Link: (economics) * France CNRS ranking; Link: (economics) * Italian ANVUR rankingANVUR Riviste di classe A * The Chartered Association of Business Schools' Academic Journal Guide * List of HEC-Pakistan Recognized Journals * Indian National Academy of Agricultural SciencesNAAS Journal Scoring *Polish ranking of journals They have been introduced as official research evaluation tools in several countries. * DHET List of Approved South African Journals * International: ScimagoJournal & Country Rank \\"\\" See also * * Article-level metrics * Author-level metrics * Citation impact * Impact factor * Journalology References Category:Citation metrics Category:Academic publishing ","title":"Journal ranking"},{"id":"10416795","text":"Lupic√≠nio Rodrigues (Porto Alegre, September 16, 1914 ‚Äì Porto Alegre, August 27, 1974) was a Brazilian singer and composer from Rio Grande do Sul.

Political influence in the United States The largest pharmaceutical companies and their two trade groups, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and Biotechnology Innovation Organization, lobbied on at least 1,600 pieces of legislation between 1998 and 2004. According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, pharmaceutical companies spent $900 million on lobbying between 1998 and 2005, more than any other industry. During the same period, they donated $89.9 million to federal candidates and political parties, giving approximately three times as much to Republicans as to Democrats. According to the Center for Public Integrity, from January 2005 through June 2006 alone, the pharmaceutical industry spent approximately $182 million on Federal lobbying.Pushing Prescriptions - The Center for Public Integrity The industry has 1,274 registered lobbyists in Washington D.C. Controversy in the U.S.=Prescription drug costs in the U.S. Critics of the pharmaceutical lobby argue that the drug industry's influence allows it to promote legislation friendly to drug manufacturers at the expense of patients. The lobby's influence in securing the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was considered a major and controversial victory for the industry, as it prevents the government from directly negotiating prices with drug companies who provide those prescription drugs covered by Medicare. Price negotiations are instead conducted between manufacturers and the pharmacy benefit managers providing Medicare Part D benefits under contract with Medicare. In 2010 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the average discount negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers at 14%. The high price of U.S. prescription drugs has been a source of ongoing controversy. Corporations state that the high costs are the result of pricey research and development programs. Critics point to the development of drugs having only small incremental benefit. According to Marcia Angell, the former head of the New England Journal of Medicine, \\"The United States is the only advanced country that permits the pharmaceutical industry to charge exactly what the market will bear.\\" In contrast, the RAND Corporation and authors from the National Bureau of Economic Research have argued that price controls stifle innovation and are economically counterproductive in the long term.

Johnson Administration in the United States. Earlier he served as Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Relations from 1961 to 1965, initially for President John F. Kennedy. Reynolds was an industrialist, and had been a member of the National Labor Relations Board under President Harry S. Truman. Reynolds was born in Brooklyn, New York, to James Sr., a teacher and later Assistant Superintendent of Schools for the City of New York, and Katherine (n√©e Mahoney). He graduated from Columbia University and worked in finance on Wall Street, co-founding the firm Naumburg & Reynolds, later became Director of Labor Relations in the office of the president of United States Pipe & Foundry. He left when he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II, holding a number of positions before joining the staff of the Under Secretary of the Navy as Special Assistant for labor issues, and mustered out in May 1946 with the rank of Commander. In August 1946, the Senate gave unanimous approval to President Truman's appointment of Reynolds to the National Labor Relations Board. As Undersecretary of Labor for President Johnson, one of Reynolds' most well- known moments came in April 1968. Martin Luther King Jr. had gone to Memphis, Tennessee, to support African-American garbage workers during the Memphis Sanitation Strike. They had walked off the job to \\"protest unsafe conditions, abusive white supervisors, low wages, and to gain recognition for their union.\\" On April 5, the day after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., President Johnson instructed Reynolds to go to Memphis to mediate the conflict and settle the strike. Within two weeks, Reynolds had developed a face-saving solution for Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb to sign a new deal with the union; Loeb had stymied unionization by refusing to authorize automatic payment of union dues from the sanitation-workers' paychecks, so Reynolds suggested that the city allow the workers to designate a portion of their paycheckequal to at least the amount of their union duesas savings deposited to a credit union under federal administration, which then transferred the appropriate amount to the union. Ultimately, the union was recognized and workers received a 5% raise, to $1.90/hour. Reynolds died at Georgetown University Hospital in 1986.

An artificial facet replacement is a joint prosthesis intended to replace the natural facets and other posterior elements of the spine, restoring normal (or near-normal) motion while providing stabilization of spinal segments. It is typically used as an adjunct to laminectomy, laminotomy, neural decompression, and facetectomy, in lieu of standard lumbar fusion. The prosthesis is indicated for back and leg pain caused by central or lateral spinal stenosis, degenerative disease of the facets with instability, and grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis with objective evidence of neurological impairment. History Patents related to facet replacement have been around since the 1980s; more intense research into artificial facet replacement as an effective and marketable prosthesis has been ongoing since the mid-2000s. Prominent researched options include: * ACADIA: a facet replacement implant \\"designed to reproduce facet motion while restoring normal stability and motion,\\" first tested in 2006; also known as the Anatomic Facet Replacement System (AFRS); clinical trials still ongoing as of September 2015 * TOPS: a total posterior arthroplasty system first tested in 2006; clinical trials completed in 2011 * TFAS: the Total Facet Anthroplasty System, a nonfusion spinal implant originally developed by Archus Orthopedics in 2005; clinical trial status unknown since February 2009, when the company was dissolved but then acquired by Facet Solutions, then Globus medical; status unknown Current status and efficacy In 2011, in a retrospective and future analysis of the technology in the International Journal of Spine Surgery, Serhan et al. opined that artificial facet replacement still had much to prove: > In the future, facet replacement devices will require a substantial amount > of validation testing and numerous clinical studies before they can be > considered a viable treatment option for the treatment of spinal disorders. > To date, most pathophysiologic research and thus surgical treatments have > been focused on the disc as a pain generator. A more comprehensive focus on > re-establishing the structure and function of the human functional spinal > unit may include facet replacement. A better understanding of facet function > and facet-mediated pain, possibly through classification of facet > degeneration, may be needed to support the use of such devices. More recently, an August 2014 critique in the journal Neurosurgery has suggested that research aside, at least in the United States the regulatory process has led to \\"time lag inherent in the design, development and implementation of new technologies\\" such as artificial facet replacement, noting that both ACADIA and TOPS were still not FDA-approved within the U.S. In the short-term, study literature has provided \\"insufficient support\\" for the prosthesis, with pessimal results for the procedure. However, more long- term results (such as those from the seven-year follow-up on TOPS implants) have been encouraging, albeit limited by patient sample size.

Set in a fictional town called Namimori in modern Japan, the series' main protagonists are of Japanese descent. However, their connection to an Italian Mafia family results in a majority of other characters introduced being mainly of Italian descent, including most of its antagonists. The story centers on middle school student Tsunayoshi \\"Tsuna\\" Sawada, who finds out that he is the heir to the most powerful Mafia family, the Vongola. The current Vongola boss thus sends his most trusted member, the titular character and infant hitman, Reborn, to train the future boss. Tsuna gradually becomes a more confident person and leader, while Reborn slowly recruits members into Tsuna's own Mafia family, which mostly includes Tsuna's schoolmates. Though they encounter new allies in the form of other hitmen and mafiosi, they also attract attention from those who want to annihilate the future boss of the Vongola Family. Enemies such as the Kokuyo Gang, a group of Mafia criminals, and The Varia, an elite team of assassins, prove to be formidable challenges for Tsuna's new \\"family\\". When the story later shifts into an alternate future, nine years and ten months later, in which some of the characters are transported into, they have to adapt to a world where every Vongola member, as well as their allies, is being hunted down by a powerful rival family of that era, the Millefiore. The characters transported from the past into this future are joined by adult versions of the ones who have yet to be replaced with their younger. Various publications that review manga series have mostly praised the eccentric cast of characters in Reborn!. Some attribute the story's humor to the peculiar characters, with one reviewer positively describing it is as an insane collection of characters. The story's shift into a darker and more serious tone by volume eight garnered even more praise, with some finding the characters being no longer simply used for slapstick comedy pleasing, and that the characters' evolving maturity is gratifying. Creation and conception The Reborn! characters have also appeared in Akira Amano's early versions of the series that were meant for adult readers due to the violence that it contained. Amano has referred to most of her characters as \\"weirdos\\", and mentioned that though she changed the storyline's style starting from volume 8 of the manga, she still kept adding the weirdo characters. Protagonists=Tsunayoshi Sawada , referred to simply as , is the 14-year-old central character of the series. Because of his severely low self-esteem and lack of talent in any activity, Tsuna is known as at his middle school, Namimori. After being informed that he is the heir to the Vongola Family, due in part to him being the great-great-great grandson of the first Vongola boss from 400 years ago, as well as the untimely deaths of the other candidates for the position, he is trained into becoming a mob-boss by the infant Vongola hitman Reborn. Tsuna is often shot by Reborn with a bullet that increases his physical abilities (deathperation bullets) in order for him to fulfill his regrets. That state, which is called the dying will mode, is what gradually makes others see him in a better light. For the most part of the series, Tsuna rejects his position and wants nothing to do with the Mafia, however, due to the results of various conflicts involving himself and his friends, his own power matures and he eventually starts embracing his destiny. He is the Bearer of the Sky Ring. He is voiced by Yukari Kokubun in the anime. Reborn is an Arcobaleno and the holder of the Yellow pacifier of the Sun. The titular character, Reborn is an infant hitman belonging to the Vongola Family. As the Vongola IX's most trusted member, he becomes Tsuna's home tutor and trains him into becoming a Mafia boss using torturous ways. He often shoots Tsuna with special bullets that enhances his abilities; these bullets are created inside his shape-shifting chameleon \\"partner\\" named , who usually sits on Reborn's fedora. No matter how strong the emotion, Reborn always keeps a straight face and handles many situations as calmly as possible. Reborn often says \\"Ciaossu\\" (a mix of the Italian \\"ciao\\" and the Japanese \\"ossu\\", which is a casual male greeting). Later in the manga, this is revealed to be a mispronunciation of his real catchphrase, \\"chaos,\\" developed because he was unable to pronounce the consonants of \\"chaos\\" in his baby form. He randomly appears dressed as \\"another person\\" who no one except Tsuna and Dino recognizes, despite his disguises being obvious to the audience. He is normally voiced by Neeko in the anime but in his short appearances as an adult, Ken Narita voices him. Hayato Gokudera is a 14-year-old transfer student from Italy who was placed in Tsuna's class. Hayato is a dynamite expert nicknamed \\"Smokin' Bomb Hayato\\" („Çπ„É¢„Éº„Ç≠„É≥„Éª„Éú„É† Èöº‰∫∫ Sum≈çkin Bomu Hayato), or \\"Hurricane Bomb Hayato\\" in the anime. He keeps various explosives hidden on his body and uses those explosives liberally by lighting them with a cigarette (or several) held in his mouth. Initially, he comes to Japan in order to test Tsuna's strength, and after the latter risks his life to save Hayato, he devotes himself entirely to Tsuna, having sworn to become his right-hand man. A hot-headed and short-tempered youth, he continuously gets into fights with several of the other characters, especially to those who try to get too close to Tsuna. Despite his personality, he is considered to be a genius, excelling in his academic studies. He is Tsuna's Guardian of the Storm Ring. He is voiced by Hidekazu Ichinose in the anime. Takeshi Yamamoto is the 14-year-old popular baseball star of Namimori Middle School. Despite his carefree and outgoing personality, he initially has no confidence in doing anything other than baseball, even attempting to commit suicide after sustaining major injury to his arm. After Tsuna reassures him, the two become close friends, and Reborn tries to recruit him into the Vongola Family. He hardly takes anything seriously, and is usually oblivious to what is truly happening around him, often tricked by Reborn into participating in Mafia- related events because he thinks that they are all just playing a game. Though he becomes a dedicated and valuable member of Tsuna's family, growing to become a fighter who excels at swordsmanship, he still does not understand the full extent of the situation surrounding the Mafia. He is Tsuna's Guardian of the Rain Ring. He is voiced by Suguru Inoue in the anime. Kyoya Hibari is the leader of Namimori's Discipline Committee, or Prefects, whose members happen to be a group of delinquents loyal to him despite his lack of care for them. Though he mostly speaks in a calm tone, Hibari is an excellent but violent fighter himself, who uses a pair of tonfa as his primary weapons. Though he uses his status to harass others, he actually has great pride in his school and has a soft side toward animals and small children. However, students are not the only ones who fear him, teachers and other town residents know of him as well since he enforces his form of order throughout the entire town. He prefers to be alone, usually beating up those who crowd near him. Despite caring little about the events surrounding Tsuna and his friends, Hibari takes a great interest in Reborn after seeing his abilities, which is reciprocated by Reborn, who wants to recruit him as part of Tsuna's own family. He is Tsuna's Guardian of the Cloud Ring. He is voiced by Takashi Kond≈ç in the anime. Ryohei Sasagawa is the 15-year-old passionate member of the boxing club at Namimori Middle School. He's extremely loud. He constantly asks others he believe are strong to join his club, most notably Tsuna. In response, Reborn wants to recruit him into Tsuna's family. Every time he sees Tsuna and his family doing something strange, he gets fired up and always wants to be a part of it. Because of his energetic character, however, he does not understand the full extent of Tsuna's connection with the Mafia, but still does everything that he can to protect him and fights with as much spirit and confidence as the others. Proficient in hand-to-hand combat, his boxing training lead to his peak physical condition. He has a habit of always saying \\"to the extreme\\" as a single response or as an ending to his sentences. He is Tsuna's Guardian of the Sun Ring. He is voiced by Hidenobu Kiuchi in the anime. Kyoko Sasagawa is a girl Tsuna has a crush on, and Ryohei's young sister. Though she is not fully aware of how much Tsuna likes her, she thinks of him as a good friend. Although, later on in the series it is hinted that she has feelings for him. She is somewhat air headed, and initially thinks that all the events surrounding Tsuna are part of a game. She first sees Tsuna in action after being sent nine years and ten months into the future right when her future self was being attacked by Millefiore members. Growing more suspicious of the others' actions, she and Haru spy on them and learns the truth about them and the Mafia. She is voiced by Y≈´na Inamura in the anime. Lambo is a cow suit-clad 5-year-old assassin from Italy affiliated with the Bovino (\\"Bovino\\" means \\"bovine\\" in Italian) Familia. He has a huge afro (which he stores a variety of objects in, such as snacks and weapons) with horns on the sides of his head. Despite being a hitman, he lacks the emotional maturity and discipline that Reborn has and is also very conceited as well as being a crybaby. In order to prove that he is worthy of becoming his own family's boss, he comes to Japan to kill Reborn, though he only proves that he is no match for the Vongola hitman. He also possesses his family's Ten-Year Bazooka, which replaces his present self with another version of himself ten years into the future. He is Tsuna's Guardian of the Lightning Ring. His child self is voiced by Junko Takeuchi, while his older self is voiced by Kenjir≈ç Tsuda in the anime. Mukuro Rokudo is a 15-year-old Mafia criminal who escaped from an Italian prison, which held some of the most dangerous Mafia criminals, before he was to be executed. Not long after, he, along with his two subordinates, came to Japan, enrolled in Kokuyo Junior High, and started the Kokuyo Gang, which consists of heinous criminals who have recently escaped from prison. Skilled in casting illusions as well as mind control. He attempts to take his revenge on the Mafia by taking over Mafia criminal Lancia's body and using him to wreak havoc. When his plan fails due to Tsuna's interference, he is once again imprisoned.

He is voiced by Toshinobu Iida in the anime. Chrome Dokuro is a 13-year-old Japanese girl who is recruited by Kokuyo Gang. She was originally known as until Mukuro Rokudo saved her life by creating illusionary organs for her when she lost her right eye and some of her internal organs in an accident. Since then she and Mukuro are sharing one body. Chrome is named the holder of the Vongola Mist Ring. After being transferred into the future, her physical condition takes a turn for the worse as several of her internal organs begin to fail. However, under Future Hibari's instructions, she uses the power of her Vongola Ring to sustain her organs via her own illusions, thus avoiding any immediate danger. She is voiced by Satomi Akesaka in the anime. Antagonists=Kokuyo Gang The Kokuyo Gang is a group of Mafia criminals that have escaped from one of the highest-security prison. The gang is led by Mukuro Rokudo and was formed after Mukuro escaped from the prison on the eve of his execution along with several prisoners. The gang then moved to Japan to look for the successor of Vongola and took over Kokuyo Junior High within three days. The members of Kokuyo Gang are as follows; Mukuro Rokudo, Ken Joshima, Chikusa Kakimoto, Lancia, M.M, Birds, and Bloody Twins. Varia The Varia is the Vongola Family's elite, independent assassination team. They are composed of genius assassins who work in the deepest recesses of the Mafia. Each member takes on missions that are said to be impossible to accomplish by humans, however, they do not accept a mission unless they believe there is a 98% chance of success. Those that see them work often say that their high level assassination skills are demonic. Despite lacking loyalty and respect for other members, they are extremely loyal to their leader, Xanxus. The members of Varia are as follows; Xanxus (Sky), Superbi Squalo (Rain), Lussuria (Sun), Levi-A-Than (Lightning), Gola Mosca (Cloud), Belphegor (Storm), Mammon (Mist), and ten years later in the future, Fran (Mist, replacing Mammon). The Varia also appear to have more than fifty subordinates ranged under the command of the main members. The Varia is apparently reclusive, only showing themselves after Iemitsu Sawada disappeared. Millefiore Family The is the Mafia family that is engaged in battle against the Vongola Family in the future. The Millefiore is a result of the merging of two separate Mafia families: the up-and-coming Family led by Byakuran, and the family with as much history as the Vongola, the led by Uni. They are organized into two groups to distinguish their old families, which are then further separated into 17 different squads, each named for a plant or flower. Those originally from the Giglio Nero are the Black Spell and have the tendency to engage in direct combat, while those from the Gesso are the White Spell and specialize in cunning battle tactics. There appears to be animosity between members of the White Spell and the Black Spell, resulting in a lack of communication and sabotage by individual squads. Their organization also possesses the Mare Rings, a set of seven rings on par with the Vongola Rings originally belonging solely to the Giglio Nero. Daemon Spade Daemon Spade was originally the first Vongola Mist Guardian. However, he later betrayed Vongola Primo, Giotto, forcing him to step down as Vongola Boss. After Giotto's resignation as Vongola Boss, Daemon became the Vongola Second Mist Guardian and continued to watch over Vongola for generation to generation by cutting off his attachment with his own body and survive for years by continuously possessing people in order to make sure that the Vongola stay strong. He arranged the battle between 10th Generation Simon Family that led by Enma and Vongola Family that led by Tsuna. He is a dangerous and expert illusionist, for he has the ability to create fake weapons with his real illusions and also has the ability to seal away his enemies into his illusionary world. Vendice The Vendice are the guards of Mafia law who punish those who defy their law without mercy and imprison Mafia criminals in the Vendicare, a prison from which no one before Mukuro had ever been able to escape. They have existed ever since the founding of the Mafia. Each of the Vendice possesses a black flame called the Flame of Night, which allows them to teleport to any place they wish to go. They are led by their boss, Bermuda von Veckenschtein, who's also known as the Arcobaleno with the Clear Pacifier and who used to be known as the strongest Arcobaleno.

They possess the Vongola Rings, seven invaluable rings which have been around since the founding of the Mafia underworld and are usually in possession of the main members known as the Vongola Guardians. They are also rich in various traditions, most notably the Vongola Tournament, a traditional battle in which two groups vie for the seven guardian positions. By the start of the series, a.k.a. is the current head of the Vongola family. It is implied that he is becoming too weak to lead the family, and thus accepted Tsuna as the next head of the Vongola Family. However, Xanxus, his adopted son, deemed himself more worthy to become the next boss, so he kidnapped and replaced IX with a fake, who sanctioned the traditional Vongola Tournament. The real IX was placed within the Gola Mosca machine, gradually draining him of his life energy, until he is saved by Tsuna. Arcobaleno The Arcobaleno (which means \\"rainbow\\" in Italian) is the group of the seven strongest infants, who each possesses a pacifier colored as one of the colors of the rainbow, with each color corresponding with their Dying Will Flame. Their pacifiers will glow when a member nears another Arcobaleno. They were all transformed from adults into their current forms, having sacrificed themselves in order to protect the ultimate power \\"7¬≥\\" (Tri-Ni-Sette). Each of them gained their own \\"curse\\" and specific abilities, and are able to emit the Dying Will Flame throughout their entire body. In addition to Reborn, the Arcobaleno are: *, the first holder of Orange pacifier of the Sky and the boss of Giglio Nero Family. Becoming the Sky Arcobaleno, her curse not only changed her into a baby, but also shortened her life span. Sometimes afterwards, she died and passed her Arcobaleno title to her daughter, .

Both Luce and Aria are voiced by Atsuko Yuya. *, the holder of the Blue pacifier of the Rain. Though he is not part of the original seven Arcobaleno, he attained the blue pacifier after attempting to take the place of a member on the day that they were all turned into babies. A former member of the COMSUBIN, he carries heavy artillery, using an anti-tank rifle as his primary weapon. His animal partner is a falcon named Falco, that usually rests atop his head and it can help him fly to distant places. Colonnello acts like a rival towards Reborn and vice versa, but despite this, he shares many traits with Reborn, like being a merciless tutor, suddenly taking naps, and having a sharp tongue. He is voiced by Daisuke Nakamura in the anime. *, the holder of the Purple pacifier of the Cloud. Skull wears a full leather outfit and a motorcycle helmet reminiscent of the time he was a stunt man. His pet is a giant armored octopus whose tentacles follow his hand and finger movements. He is voiced by Tetsuya Yanagihara in the anime. *, the holder of the Indigo pacifier of the Mist. Viper is a member of the elite assassination team, the Varia, under the name .

Viper also has a black frog named Fantasma that lies on top of his head. By turning into a yellow salamander and biting its tail, which forms into a \\"halo\\" above him, Fantasma can give Mammon the ability to fly. Viper claims to have been trying to break the Arcobaleno curse, and had sealed his pacifier so that other Arcobaleno cannot sense him. Viper has also created a chain that conceals the power of the Arcobaleno pacifiers, as well as the Ring Flames. Viper is voiced by Rumi Shishido in the anime. *, the holder of a corrupted pacifier. She states that she cannot live up to the Arcobaleno name, considering herself to be one of its weakest members. This is due to her curse being incomplete after Colonnello, her former subordinate in the COMSUBIN, attempted to take her place. Also, if she does not use her Arcobaleno powers, her curse would gradually disappear, which is why she eventually becomes an adult again. However, upon using her Arcobaleno powers in the future, her pacifier glows blue, and she states that her pacifier was supposed to be the blue pacifier that Colonnello attained. She is also part of the Vongola's CEDEF, or Outside Advisors. She is voiced by Masami Suzuki in the anime. *, the holder of the Red pacifier of the Storm. He is shown to be one of the wisest and the strongest of the Arcobaleno and also always seems to know what is going on.

He is voiced by Takashi Kond≈ç. *, the holder of the Green pacifier of the Thunder and one of the three creators of the Box Weapons. Appearing as a scientist, Verde is more interested in his studies than he is in the curse of the rainbow, as indicated during the Curse of the Rainbow arc when he reveals he was only participating to give Reborn \\"a good scare.\\" His pet is a green crocodile. He is voiced by Masahiro Kono. =Giotto= Giotto is the founder of the Vongola Famiglia in the late 19th century; thus, its first Boss. He is Italian. He is also the creator of the Zero Point Breakthrough technique. After his retirement, he moved to Japan and started a family, changing his family name to Sawada to ensure no one outside the family knew about his mafia identity. He is the paternal great-great-great grandfather of Tsuna, who has repeatedly been shown to be similar to him, as they have the same weapon and techniques (including the Zero Point Breakthrough), almost identical appearances, and equally unorthodox Famiglias (the First Famiglia included aristocrats, military men, rival mafiosos and religious people). Their Guardians are quite similar as well: Yamamoto, Hibari, Mukuro, Lambo, Gokudera, and Ryohei have already been shown to be very much like their first predecessors in appearance, weapon of choice, and personality. CEDEF Members of the Consulenza Esterna Della Famiglia (Italian for \\"External Consultants of the Family\\") are unofficial members of the Vongola Family. They hold a very important position in the family's structure, in that, during times of crisis, the CEDEF leader becomes the family's second-in-command. They also have as much voting power as the Vongola boss when choosing the family's next boss, and if the two disagree on who the heir will be, the CEDEF leader has the power to split the Vongola Rings. =Iemitsu Sawada= is Tsuna's often absent father, who has supposedly been working abroad at oil fields for the past two years. Tsuna believes him to be a loser father who has nothing to do with the Mafia, but Iemitsu is actually the \\"Outside Advisor\\", which is the second highest position in the Vongola Family, and is known as the Vongola's \\"Young Lion\\". After the fake Vongola IX chose Xanxus as his successor, Iemitsu, who wants Tsuna to become the next boss, protested and refused to give Xanxus the Vongola Rings, traveling around the world while he waited for the IX's reply. He returns to Japan with the real halves of the Vongola Rings, as well as a message from the IX sanctioning the Vongola Tournament. He secretly watches over the training of Tsuna and his family, and during the tournament, Iemitsu goes to Italy with his subordinates, and finds out that the IX that has been giving orders was a fake. Iemitsu usually carries a pickaxe. He is voiced by Masami Iwasaki in the anime. =Basil= Basilicum, commonly known as simply , is Iemitsu's young disciple and subordinate. He possesses the blue, rain attribute flame, and has the ability to go into Dying Will Mode when he consumes special pills made by Iemitsu. Due to being strictly trained since early childhood, he is a very talented fighter. Unknown to Basil, in order for Iemitsu to safely deliver the real halves of the Vongola rings to Japan, he was sent to deliver the fake Vongola Rings to Tsuna. During this, he encounters Superbi Squalo, and is subsequently beat. Despite being used as a decoy, he remains extremely loyal to Iemitsu, and helps train Tsuna in order to help the latter control the Dying Will Flame. The CEDEF later sends him into the future as support for the Vongola, and his box weapon is shown to release a dolphin, which he can telepathically communicate with. Basil also has a habit of speaking in an archaic manner; usually replacing 'You' with 'thou', 'thee', and 'thy', and refers to Tsuna and the guardians with the suffix '-dono'. This unusual habit sometimes interferes in his way of modern speech. He is voiced by Yuka Terasaki in the anime. Cervello The is an organization whose representatives consist of masked women who all seem to look exactly the same and whose names are not known. When one member is beaten or killed, another member can immediately take their place. The organization also appears to possess illusionists. They are proclaimed as the judges for the Vongola Tournament under the (fake) IX's direct orders. In the future, they are working with or in conjunction with Shoichi Irie, and appear to be part of the Millefiore Family's White Spell squad. During the Six Funeral Wreaths's battle against Tsuna's group, the Cervello are appointed as the judges. It was stated that each Mafia family have their own Cervello organisation. Foundation The Foundation is an organization created by Kyoya Hibari in order to gather information on the \\"ultimate power\\". Its members are former members of Namimori High's Disciplinary Committee, most notably , Hibari's subordinate and second-in- command, who always wears his hair in a pompadour. Kusakabe is voiced by Takagi Shun in the anime. Simon Family  The Simon Family has deep ties to the Vongola Family, but vanished at the end of the Vongola Primo's rule because of Daemon Spade. At the beginning of the Simon Arc, the Simon Family were thought to be evil. However, after the truth was recovered, they joined forces with the Vongola X family. =Cozart Simon= is the first boss of Simon Family and Enma's ancestor. He had close bonds with Vongola Primo, Giotto, as close as brothers. He was said to be betrayed by Giotto during a massive mafia war and was killed from limbs to limbs. However, in reality, he was saved by Giotto's Guardians who had seen through Daemon's plan and afterwards along with Giotto, they made a deal with the Vendici that if Vongola and Simon ever fight against one another, the Vendici will deliver the punishment. After the war, he and his Family went back into hiding and never met Giotto or Vongola again for the rest of their lifetime but not before making an oath with Giotto that their Families will stay close until the end of time and believe their descendants will meet and smile at each other again. =Enma Kozato= is the 10th boss of the near-eradicated Simon family. He was introduced as a transfer student at Namimori High with his fellow subordinates. After he shows his timid personality during his introduction, he starts getting bullied. He became friends with Tsuna after an incident. He later decided to leave a letter to Tsuna to test if he really treated him as a friend. Unfortunately, the letter got dumped into the bin by Lambo, which led to the battle between the Vongola and the Simon family. Later he got possessed by Daemon Spade because of his anger and hate and his powers start to go berserk, but Tsuna stopped him for good and the two became friends after the truth was revealed. They later joined forces and defeated Daemon Spade. Other characters=Haru Miura is an eccentric and peppy girl who has a tendency to jump to wild conclusions, and has various odd costumes that she designs herself, as well as a myriad of wild habits. Despite this, she attends Midori Middle School, one of the toughest elite schools to get into in the area. She initially adores Reborn, but after she is saved from drowning by Tsuna, she diverted her adoration towards him instead. She loves and is overprotective of children and is usually the one to babysit Lambo and I-Pin with Kyoko. According to Tsuna, adult Haru has become more feminine, but her way of thinking is still the same. She is voiced by Hitomi Yoshida in the anime. Hana Kurokawa is a classmate of Tsuna and Kyoko's friend. She appears more observant and thoughtful than most of the other characters. Though she does not know the truth, she remains suspicious of Tsuna's and his friends' activities. She has a crush on the 15-year-old Lambo, in the normal time. It is hinted that in the future, she has a relationship with Kyoko's brother Ryohei. At the same time she hates children (especially the child form Lambo), to the point where she gets hives when she gets annoyed by them. She is voiced by Miki Ootani in the anime. Nana Sawada is Tsuna's mother, who, despite caring deeply for him, has fairly little belief in her son succeeding in life. She helps feed all the people that are presently living in her house and does not see anything strange with any of them. She seems to be unaware of the fact that both her husband and her son are part of the Mafia, but is aware they are both up to something dangerous. She is voiced by Rika Fukami in the anime.

Bianchi, known as \\"Poison Scorpion Bianchi\\" in the Mafia underground, specializes in poison cooking. Since she, herself, is immune to her own cooking, she does not see anything wrong with the food she gives others. Even though they seem to have a strained relationship, she has shown great concern for Gokudera if he is injured, fighting, or suffering from stomach aches, which she does not realize are caused by her (except if they do not have eye contact). Before, she was in love in her ex-boyfriend named Romeo, who looks very similar to Adult Lambo. Whenever Adult Lambo appears, she mistakes him for Romeo, and uses her Poison Cooking to destroy him. Currently, she is in love with Reborn, who was a former associate of hers, and wants to kill Tsuna to free up Reborn's schedule, though refuses to kill him for the benefit of others. Bianchi always states that \\"Love\\" is the strongest force of all. In the future, Bianchi returns with crucial information about the Millefiore Family after her travels with Futa. She tries to train Gokudera on how to control the rings and boxes, and is shown to be able to summon scorpions which emanate the Dying Will Flame, called Scorpione De Tempesta (Storm Scorpions). She is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the anime. Doctor Shamal is a crazed womanizer who hits on every cute woman he sees, though often unsuccessfully. He is said to be hiding in Japan after being charged in his own country for putting the moves on 2082 women simultaneously, one of which being a queen. He is both a skilled doctor, albeit one that refuses to treat men, and a renowned assassin known as \\"Trident Shamal\\" who was even asked to join the Varia. His primary means of combat stem from the 666 pills he carries that contain trident mosquitoes, his own breed of genetically altered mosquitoes named for their trident-shaped stingers that infect his enemies with deadly diseases. He claims to be infected with 666 diseases that have no effect on him due to the negating effects of each disease; if he has a disease that rapidly decreases body temperature, then he has another one that increases it, and so on. Shamal also happens to be the one that introduced Hayato Gokudera to bombs when he used to work for Gokudera's family. He agrees to become Gokudera's home tutor during the Vongola Tournament, but only after Gokudera learns that protecting his own life is just as important as defending those around him. He is voiced by Toshinobu Katsuya in the anime. I-Pin is a 5-year-old assassin from Hong Kong. She is regularly transformed into her 15-year-old self by way of Lambo's Ten-Year Bazooka. The 15-year-old \\"Adult I-Pin\\" is now fluent in Japanese, and despite the fact that she is one of the most promising young assassins, she works part-time at a ramen shop ten years later in order to earn money for college tuition, though she still retains her skills. I-Pin's main ability is the usage of Gyoza-Ken, which combines her martial arts abilities with special gyoza buns laced with the scent of garlic, the latter of which numbs the brain and forces the muscles to involuntarily move on their own. Her most destructive ability is the \\"Pinzu-Time Bomb\\", activated whenever I-Pin expresses extreme shyness. Pin-numbers (such as those used in mahjong) appear on her forehead, counting down until it turns her into a human bomb that can create a small crater with its destruction. Due to her near-sightedness, she sees Lambo as the broccoli monster, and often beats him up. She also has a crush on Kyoya Hibari, who bears a striking resemblance to her master, and often activates her Pinzu-Timed Super Explosion after seeing him. She is voiced by Li-Mei Chiang in the anime. Dino is the 22-year-old tenth generation boss of the which is part of the Vongola Family alliance. Dino is a young man with great skills as a fighter and a leader. Reborn's chameleon Leon created his main weapons, a whip and Enzo, which is a turtle which grows in size and rampages when soaked in water. Like Tsuna, Dino, at first, was a klutz who did not want anything to do with the Mafia, but he became a suitable Mafia boss after Reborn became his home tutor. He came to be known as (\\"Bronco Dino\\" in Viz's translation) and fixed the Cavallone's financial problems, turning them into the third most influential family. Dino, however, is so devoted to his family, that when none of his family members are around, his skills decrease dramatically, often accidentally hitting people with his whip and falling down the stairs. Dino becomes Hibari's home tutor before the Vongola Tournament, and travels with him around the country in order to train him. In the future, he advises Tsuna and the others on how to control their box weapons, and is shown to release a horse from his own box. He is first voiced by Kenta Kamakari, and then replaced by Kenn for episodes 34 onward. Futa is a young boy who ranks people by their abilities in a book half his own height. His full name is Fuuta Delle Stelle (Fuuta de la Stella, or Fuuta of the stars). He has an extremely wide range of knowledge on thousands of people and is considered to be a valuable informant for the Mafia, sometimes being paid insane amounts of money for a copy of certain rankings, but due to this, he is often chased by the Mafia. When he ranks people, gravity around him becomes distorted, making objects around him float, and images of stars and galaxies appear in his eyes. It is unknown how he actually gathers his information, some rumours say he talks to a ranking star, and his rankings do become skewed when it rains. He also has to be looking at the person to determine their rankings. He calls Tsuna his big brother referring to Tsuna as Tsuna-ni, and starts living in his house. In volume nine, after he has been controlled by Mukuro Rokudo for quite a long amount of time, it is released that he loses his power to rank, and follows the guardians around while living at Tsunayoshi Sawada's house. In the future, after gathering information with Bianchi, Futa, who now carries a suitcase rather than a book, returns to Japan with crucial information about the Millefiore Family. Futa also reveals that he was Lambo's guardian until three years before Tsuna's arrival in the future, and prefers that Lambo not be endangered. He is voiced by Yuko Sanpei in the anime. Longchamp Naito is the overly hyper, eighth generation boss-in-training from the Tomaso Family. He happens to attend the same school as Tsuna, but they first meet in their second year when they end up in the same class. Unlike Tsuna, Longchamp is optimistic and excited about everything, and though their families are rivals, he constantly befriends Tsuna. Longchamp is known to have a unique taste in women, and is shown with a different one each time. He also has a weird habit of collecting unusual objects, including dead batteries and condiment packets, and his bedroom is covered with junk as a result of his hoarding habits. His family is the creator of the , which, when shot with and revived, will cause a person to grieve about all the terrible things that have happened in their life, making others feel sorry for them. Kawahira/Checker Face Kawahira (Â∑ùÂπ≥ Kawahira) is a man who lives in the future at a real estate firm that belonged to an old lady Haru knew in the past. He is constantly referred to in earlier episodes as a frequent customer of Adult I-Pin's ramen delivery service, but makes his first appearance when Tsuna and company are trying to hide from the Six Funeral Wreaths. He possesses a Segno Hell Ring that can create strong illusions, fake murderous intent, and hides his existence. He does not outwardly state his true motives but claims that Tsuna and his friends owe him one for his help. He is later revealed to be the true identity of Checker Face („ÉÅ„Çß„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº„Éï„Çß„Ç§„Çπ ChekkƒÅfeis≈´), a man with iron hat who is the one responsible for inflicting 'The Curse of The Rainbow' to Reborn and the others, making them Arcobaleno. He appeared in the Arcobaleno's dream and offered them a way to be freed from the curse that had turned them into babies with by creating a battle royale where the Arcobaleno have to choose seven people to be their representatives to fight in their place and the winner will have his or her curse removed. However, this turned out to be a huge lie and his true intention is actually to determine the seven strongest people and intends to turn them into the next Arcobaleno without any intention to free the current Arcobaleno from their curse. As the one who administrates the Tri-ni-sette, he is the one who gave the Vongola Rings and Mare Rings to Yuni's ancestor, Sepira, who in turn entrusted the Vongola Rings to Giotto. For decades, he had selected and tricked seven people in each generation that he considered the strongest through contract job or representative battle and forcefully make them protect the Arcobaleno pacifier, cursing them into babies. After Bermuda's defeat, he appears in front of Tsuna and the others and reveal his true identity as Kawahira. He, along with Yuni, are the last two special races that had been existed even far before humans whose job are to protect the Earth through Tri-ni-set. However, their race died one by one until he, and Sepira are the only ones remained. They decided to split the seven stones of Tri-ni-set into Arcobaleno Pacifiers, Vongola Rings, and Mare Rings and gave them to human race as they alone unable to provide enough flames for the rings. He intended to remove the pacifiers from Reborn and the others and cursed those he had selected, however, Talbot arrives and came up with another solution to keep the Tri-ni-set safe. With Yuni's assurance of the future of the Tri-ni-set, Kawahira agreed to give up the order of the Tri-ni-set to Bermuda and the Vindice, entrusting them to the future generations, and removes the Arcobaleno curse from Reborn and the others. Sepira Sepira („Çª„Éî„É© Sepira) is Yuni's ancestor and the founder of Giglio Nero Famiglia, making her the first boss of the Famiglia. She, along with Kawahira, belongs to a special race that had existed far before humans -their main job is to preserve the Tri-ni-set in order to protect the balance of the Earth. When she and Kawahira were the only two remaining members of their race and unable to provide the Tri-ni-set with enough flames, they split the Tri-ni-set into Arcoblaeno Pacifiers, Mare Rings, and Vongola Rings. Borrowing power from human race, she gave the Vongola Rings to Giotto while she kept the Mare Rings to be passed down within her Family. At the time, she and Kawahira part ways after their opinions conflicted, while she wholeheartedly wished to coexist with humans, Kawahira believed otherwise. Yuni was unaware of her ancestor's true nature since Sepira kept this a secret in order to peacefully lives among humans. Merchandise Several types of merchandise have been produced based on the likeness of the Reborn! characters. Apparels from the series include replicas of the characters' clothes, such as Tsuna's X-Gloves or Reborn's hat. Other merchandise modeled after their likeness includes action figures, plush dolls, key chains, and figurines. Characters are also featured in the series' soundtracks, in which their corresponding voice actors perform songs related to their characters. They are also featured in the various games released for the series, including in video games that are mostly of the fighting game genre, and on trading cards that are part of the Reborn! trading card game. Reception The characters introduced in the Reborn! series have been both criticized and praised in several reviews of the series. With the first seven manga volumes being devoted to introducing various new characters whilst still focusing heavily on the main characters, a reviewer from comicbookbin.com believes that \\"Akira Amano composes each chapter as a separate episode, like a TV series, with a main cast and a guest character appearing each chapter.\\" He describes the ever-expanding cast of peculiar characters as a line-up of eccentrics that fit right in with the main cast, but later comments that the author strains the narrative in the sixth volume due to giving some minor characters like Longchamp Naito too much attention. Still, he positively remarks that the hilariously weird things the characters do has not been done since Seinfeld, and Erin Finnegan of Pop Culture Shock agrees, attributing the story's humor to the characters. Michael Aronson of Manga Life describes it is as the \\"most insane collection of characters thrown together in a single series,\\" while Ben Leary of Mania.com fairly says that \\"many of the plots are dependent on the cute, practically SD characters who would probably be mascots in another series.\\" Though most of the characters' reviews for volumes one through seven are primarily based on their ensuing comedic situations, the tone changes drastically as the series shifts into a more serious mood starting with volume eight. In ComicsVillage.com's Charles Tan's review of volume eight, he notes that the character designs have a \\"simple, iconic feel to them,\\" and that they can easily shift from being super-deformed to having serious expressions. Both in IGN's and mangalife.com's review of volume nine, the reviewers both expressed gratification to the main character's [Tsuna] reform, with David Rasmussen of mangalife.com now seeing Tsuna as a \\"cooler\\" character compared to how he was before. A.E. Sparrow of IGN further comments on how the characters are further developed rather than being simply used for slapstick comedy, but due to that, the readers can find themselves being concerned for their well-being.

It is a prime example of the Polish Cathedral style of church architecture in both its opulence and grand scale. A rare and special designation bestowed on the parish occurred in 1907, when the Vatican proclaimed St. Adalbert a basilica, the first in the USA. The proclamation, as well as its English translation, can be viewed to this day in the basilica's museum room. History Built by Huber and Company in 1890-1891, it was built by Polish immigrants. The building itself is brick, its dimensions are long, wide, nave high, the two towers are high with a dome wide and soaring above the main nave. At that time it was the largest church in Western New York and cost $63,000 without the furnishings. The 36 stained glass windows of the Basilica were produced by Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany. The interior was decorated by Jozef Mazur. Community The St. Adalbert's Response to Love Center, run by Sister Mary Johnice, is located next to the Basilica and provides services for the poor of Buffalo, such as hot meals, a food pantry, toys and clothing for children, GED classes, and basic career-related computer training. In 2016, St. Adalbert's former rectory was transformed into the Mother Teresa Home, a haven for pregnant women operated by the Diocesen Office of Pro-Life Activities. Current Status The last mass was scheduled for November 25, 2007, but had been put on hold due to the parish having filed an appeal to the Vatican. In February 2008 the Vatican's highest Canonical Court upheld Bishop Edward Kmiec's decision to close the church. An appeal was made by the \\"Save St. Adalbert\\" committee, and the process was delayed. Again revisited, The Vatican Congregation for the Clergy has upheld the decision to merge St. Adalbert Parish into St. John Kanty Parish, with St. Adalbert's remaining open for worship. The final weekly Mass at St. Adalbert's was celebrated on Sept. 18, 2011, marking the end of the yearlong observance of the 125th anniversary of the parish. St. Adalbert Basilica remains open to this day for four yearly special masses plus weddings, funerals, baptisms, tours, and other occasions.

Based on their profession, there are two subcastes - Mizhavu Nambiar and Thiyyadi Nambiar. Mizhavu Nambiars are associated with temple art forms like Koothu, Koodiyattam and Ottanthullal, where as Thiyyadi Nambiars are associated with the art form Ayyappan Theeyattu. Nambiars followed the marumakkathayam (matrilineal) system of inheritance. 200px Etymology The Sanskrit name of Nambiar is PƒÅnivƒÅda. 'pƒÅni' means hands and 'vƒÅda' comes from the verb 'vƒÅdanam' meaning playing; altogether meaning the one who plays with hands, since Nambiars are assigned to play the holy drum \\"Mizhavu\\", which they play with their hands only. Nambiars are assigned to play the drum \\"Mizhavu\\" in ritualistic temple performances like Koodiyattam and koothu in Koothambalams inside the temples. These highly refined art forms narrating stories from Hindu epics and puranas, combined with prevailing socio-political events, were originally performed in temples in connection with festivals by members of this community along with Chakyar community. Mizhavu Nambiars The Nambiars who play mizhavu are sometimes called Chakyar Nambiars or Mizhavu Nambiars. Their ladies are called Nangyarammas. While Nambiars were allowed to play mizhavu, Nangyarammas performs lady characters in Koodiyattam along with Chakyar. Another ritualistic performance done by Nangyarammas inside the temple is Nangiar koothu, which is an allied art of Kutiyattam. There were originally 18 Nambyar families (Madhams) in Kerala. Kochampilly, Kalakkattu, Meledath, Villuvatattu, Kuzhuppully, Trikkariyur and Cherumanattu are some among them. Thiyyadi Nambiars There is another group of Ambalavasi Nambiars called Thiyyadi Nambiars. The adjectival word Thiyyadi is used to denote that they are the performers of an art form called Ayyappan Tƒ´yƒÅttu. Their ladies are known as Marumakalammas. Contributions Nambiars are traditionally Sanskrit scholars and held prominent positions in academics. The famous Malayalam satire poet Kunchan Nambiar, who is believed to be the Sanskrit poet Rama PƒÅnivƒÅda, belongs to this caste. The chief contribution of Kunchan Nambiar is the invention and popularisation of a new performing art known as Thullal.

This single image is more informative and accurate than any single source image, and it consists of all the necessary information. The purpose of image fusion is not only to reduce the amount of data but also to construct images that are more appropriate and understandable for the human and machine perception. In computer vision, multisensor image fusion is the process of combining relevant information from two or more images into a single image. The resulting image will be more informative than any of the input images. In remote sensing applications, the increasing availability of space borne sensors gives a motivation for different image fusion algorithms. Several situations in image processing require high spatial and high spectral resolution in a single image. Most of the available equipment is not capable of providing such data convincingly. Image fusion techniques allow the integration of different information sources. The fused image can have complementary spatial and spectral resolution characteristics. However, the standard image fusion techniques can distort the spectral information of the multispectral data while merging. In satellite imaging, two types of images are available. The panchromatic image acquired by satellites is transmitted with the maximum resolution available and the multispectral data are transmitted with coarser resolution. This will usually be two or four times lower. At the receiver station, the panchromatic image is merged with the multispectral data to convey more information. Many methods exist to perform image fusion. The very basic one is the high pass filtering technique. Later techniques are based on Discrete Wavelet Transform, uniform rational filter bank, and Laplacian pyramid.  Multi-focus image fusion  Multi-focus image fusion is used to collect useful and necessary information from input images with different focus depths in order to create an output image that ideally has all information from input images. In visual sensor network (VSN), sensors are cameras which record images and video sequences. In many applications of VSN, a camera can‚Äôt give a perfect illustration including all details of the scene. This is because of the limited depth of focus exists in the optical lens of cameras. Therefore, just the object located in the focal length of camera is focused and cleared and the other parts of image are blurred. VSN has an ability to capture images with different depth of focuses in the scene using several cameras. Due to the large amount of data generated by camera compared to other sensors such as pressure and temperature sensors and some limitation such as limited band width, energy consumption and processing time, it is essential to process the local input images to decrease the amount of transmission data. The aforementioned reasons emphasize the necessary of multi-focus images fusion. Multi-focus image fusion is a process which combines the input multi-focus images into a single image including all important information of the input images and it‚Äôs more accurate explanation of the scene than every single input image. Why image fusion Multi sensor data fusion has become a discipline which demands more general formal solutions to a number of application cases. Several situations in image processing require both high spatial and high spectral information in a single image. This is important in remote sensing. However, the instruments are not capable of providing such information either by design or because of observational constraints. One possible solution for this is data fusion. Standard image fusion methods Image fusion methods can be broadly classified into two groups - spatial domain fusion and transform domain fusion. The fusion methods such as averaging, Brovey method, principal component analysis (PCA) and IHS based methods fall under spatial domain approaches. Another important spatial domain fusion method is the high pass filtering based technique. Here the high frequency details are injected into upsampled version of MS images. The disadvantage of spatial domain approaches is that they produce spatial distortion in the fused image. Spectral distortion becomes a negative factor while we go for further processing, such as classification problem. Spatial distortion can be very well handled by frequency domain approaches on image fusion. The multiresolution analysis has become a very useful tool for analysing remote sensing images. The discrete wavelet transform has become a very useful tool for fusion. Some other fusion methods are also there, such as Laplacian pyramid based, curvelet transform based etc. These methods show a better performance in spatial and spectral quality of the fused image compared to other spatial methods of fusion. The images used in image fusion should already be registered. Misregistration is a major source of error in image fusion. Some well-known image fusion methods are: * High pass filtering technique * IHS transform based image fusion * PCA based image fusion * Wavelet transform image fusion * Pair-wise spatial frequency matching Remote sensing image fusion Image fusion in remote sensing has several application domains. An important domain is the multi- resolution image fusion (commonly referred to pan-sharpening). In satellite imagery we can have two types of images *Panchromatic images - An image collected in the broad visual wavelength range but rendered in black and white. *Multispectral images - Images optically acquired in more than one spectral or wavelength interval. Each individual image is usually of the same physical area and scale but of a different spectral band. The SPOT PAN satellite provides high resolution (10m pixel) panchromatic data. While the LANDSAT TM satellite provides low resolution (30m pixel) multispectral images. Image fusion attempts to merge these images and produce a single high resolution multispectral image. The standard merging methods of image fusion are based on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) to Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) transformation. The usual steps involved in satellite image fusion are as follows: #Resize the low resolution multispectral images to the same size as the panchromatic image. #Transform the R, G and B bands of the multispectral image into IHS components. #Modify the panchromatic image with respect to the multispectral image. This is usually performed by histogram matching of the panchromatic image with Intensity component of the multispectral images as reference. #Replace the intensity component by the panchromatic image and perform inverse transformation to obtain a high resolution multispectral image. Pan-sharpening can be done with Photoshop.Pan-sharpening in Photoshop Other applications of image fusion in remote sensing are available. Medical image fusion Image fusion has become a common term used within medical diagnostics and treatment. The term is used when multiple images of a patient are registered and overlaid or merged to provide additional information. Fused images may be created from multiple images from the same imaging modality, or by combining information from multiple modalities, such as magnetic resonance image (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In radiology and radiation oncology, these images serve different purposes. For example, CT images are used more often to ascertain differences in tissue density while MRI images are typically used to diagnose brain tumors. For accurate diagnosis, radiologists must integrate information from multiple image formats. Fused, anatomically consistent images are especially beneficial in diagnosing and treating cancer. With the advent of these new technologies, radiation oncologists can take full advantage of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Being able to overlay diagnostic images into radiation planning images results in more accurate IMRT target tumor volumes. Image fusion metrics Comparative analysis of image fusion methods demonstrates that different metrics support different user needs, sensitive to different image fusion methods, and need to be tailored to the application. Categories of image fusion metrics are based on information theory features, structural similarity, or human perception.

It is also known as the reddish-bellied parakeet, and in aviculture it is usually referred to as the maroon-bellied conure, reddish- bellied conure or brown-eared conure. It has been suggested that the reddish- bellied parakeet should include the blaze-winged parakeet (P. devillei) as a subspecies based on intermediate specimens from Paraguay. But such hybrids are not common in the wild and the two populations generally maintain their integrity; recent sources are undecided on whether to treat them as one species or two.Juniper & Parr (1998) Description These birds range from 25 to 28 cm (10‚Äì11 in), and are primarily green, with a maroon patch on the belly, a \\"scaly\\" yellow-green-barred breast and sides of neck, a whitish ear- patch often tinged brown, and a maroon undertail. The specific name frontalis is a reference to its dark maroon frontlet ‚Äì a feature which separates it from most similar species. The primaries are blue on the outer webs, green on the inner webs, and dark on the tips. The beak is black. There are two subspecies, with extensive intergradation where their ranges contact: * Maroon-bellied parakeet proper, Pyrrhura frontalis frontalis ‚Äì Brazil from south Bahia to Rio Grande do Sul, and west to Mato Grosso do Sul. :Uppertail greenish-yellow grading into a broad reddish tip. * Azara's conure, Pyrrhura frontalis chiripepe ‚Äì Eastern Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, and far southern Brazil. :Uppertail entirely greenish-yellow. P. f. chiripepe at Cerrito, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil Another subspecies, kriegi, was described from Bahia in 1932, but today it is universally considered a junior synonym of the nominate subspecies. Distinguished by a narrow brownish-red tip to the tail, it constitutes just a morph or an intermediate genotype making up just 20% of the specimens even in the supposed range. The name Krieg's conure is occasionally used in aviculture for such birds, and some breed them exclusively; they are of course perfectly interfertile with individuals of the normal morph however. Ecology The maroon-bellied parakeet is common in woodland, and forest edges. In the northern part of its range, it mainly lives in highlands up to 1,400 m (4,600 ft), but elsewhere it is primarily found in lowlands up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Tolerates disturbance well and even lives in urban parks (e.g., Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo) and feeds in gardens. Flock size is usually only 6‚Äì12 individuals, but up to 40. As other members of the genus Pyrrhura, it primarily feeds on fruits, flowers, and similar plant matter; they rarely participate in mixed-species feeding flock.Machado (1999) It is generally common and not considered threatened by the IUCN.BLI (2008) Though there is little trade in these parrots, captive-bred birds are occasionally available as pets. Maroon-bellied parakeets can learn to talk, although not clearly. They are among the quietest conures, but their shrill voices still irritate some people.

Creating a new life in America Masa arrived in the United States in 1901. In 1915, he settled in Asheville, North Carolina, where he would spend the final 18 years of his life. After initially working for the Grove Park Inn as a bellhop and valet, Masa left the inn to take a position as a photographer in February 1919. Eventually, he founded Plateau Studio (a business he later sold, which is still in operation today). His customers included some of the town's most affluent citizens such as the Vanderbilt, Grove, and Seely families. The Great Smoky Mountains Masa came to love the mountains of Western North Carolina and worked tirelessly for their preservation, often at his own expense. Using his photographic equipment and an odometer he crafted from an old bicycle, Masa meticulously catalogued a significant number of peaks, the distances between them, and the names given to them by the local settlers and the Cherokee. He was a friend of Horace Kephart, and the two of them worked together to ensure that a large portion of the Great Smoky Mountains would be established as a national park. Masa also scouted and marked the entire North Carolina portion of the Appalachian Trail. Death and legacy Masa died in 1933 from influenza. He had desired to be buried next to his good friend Kephart near Bryson City, North Carolina.\\"A hike with a bit of history \\", The Smoky Mountain News, July 13, 2005 However with no surviving family or estate, his burial was organized by his local hiking club, and they did not have the necessary funds to do so.

It is a resident breeder in coastal bush, evergreen forest and dry shrub land in eastern and southern Africa. It is the only member of the genus Andropadus. Taxonomy and systematics Eighteen species of greenbuls originally described in the genus Andropadus were re-classified to the genera Arizelocichla, Stelgidillas and Eurillas in 2010. This has left Andropadus as a monotypic genus with the sombre greenbul remaining as its sole extant species. The sombre greenbul was originally described in the genus Turdus and was later re-classified to the genus Andropadus. Alternatively, some authorities classify the sombre greenbul in the genus Pycnonotus. Alternate names for the sombre greenbul include the sombre bulbul, southern sombre bulbul and southern sombre greenbul. Subspecies Four subspecies of the sombre greenbul are recognized: * Zanzibar sombre greenbul (A. i. insularis) - Hartlaub, 1861: Originally described as a separate species. Includes Frick's greenbul which was also originally described as a separate species. Found from southern Ethiopia and southern Somalia to eastern Tanzania * Transvaal sombre greenbul (A. i. importunus) - (Vieillot, 1818): Found from the highlands of northern South Africa and western Swaziland south along coast to Western Cape * Endoto sombre greenbul (A. i. oleaginus) - Peters, W, 1868: Found in southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique and lowland northern South Africa * A. i. hypoxanthus - Sharpe, 1876: Found in south-eastern Tanzania to central Mozambique, central Zimbabwe and south-central Zambia Former species Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus Andropadus: * Shelley's greenbul (as Andropadus masukuensis) * Kakamega greenbul (as Andropadus kakamegae) * Cameroon greenbul (as Andropadus montanus or Andropadus concolor) * Western greenbul (as Andropadus tephrolaemus) * Olive-breasted greenbul (as Andropadus kikuyuensis) * Mountain greenbul (as Andropadus nigriceps) * Uluguru greenbul (as Andropadus neumanni) * Black-browed greenbul (as Andropadus fusciceps) * Yellow-throated greenbul (as Andropadus chlorigula) * Stripe-cheeked greenbul (as Andropadus milanjensis) * Olive-headed greenbul (as Andropadus olivaceiceps) * Stripe-faced greenbul (as Andropadus striifacies or Andropadus striifascies) * Slender-billed greenbul (as Andropadus gracilirostris) * Little greenbul (as Andropadus virens) * Little grey greenbul (as Andropadus gracilis) * Ansorge's greenbul (as Andropadus ansorgei) * Kavirondo little grey greenbul (as Charitillas kavirondensis) * Plain greenbul (as Andropadus alexandri or Andropadus curvirostris) * Yellow-whiskered greenbul (as Andropadus latirostris) * Joyful greenbul (as Andropadus laetissimus) * Falkenstein's greenbul (as Andropadus falkensteini) * Yellow-streaked greenbul (as Andropadus flavostriatus) Description The sombre greenbul is 15‚Äì18 cm long, with mainly dull greyish olive-green plumage, paler on the underparts than above. There are variations in colour based on habitat range. Individuals located in southern Africa tend to be plain, olive-green. To the north, birds are yellower with greener upper parts. It has a white iris. The sexes are similar in plumage, but juveniles are even duller than the adult and have dark, grey eyes. There is no colour distinction among sexes. The subspecies A. i. hypoxanthus is much yellower below than the nominate subspecies. The sombre greenbul is a vocal species, and the most typical call is a monotonous, ringing phrase starting with a penetrating single whistle weeeewee, followed by a jumbled chortle and ending off with a rather plaintive, drawn out whistle willy. If agitated, a call of peeet peeet peeet repeatedly is likely to be heard. Behaviour and ecology The sombre greenbul is a common bird, which tends to stay hidden in foliage and is more often heard than seen. It is usually found in pairs or small groups foraging for insects, fruit and small snails.

Described as Sydney's \\"iconic eccentric\\", she was known for her contentious relationships with the city's taxi drivers and for her ability to quote any passage from Shakespeare for money. Biography  Born in Ashfield, New South Wales, to Maria Louisa Miles (n√©e Binnington), and the third of five surviving children, she grew up in the Sydney suburb of St Ives. Her father, William John Miles, was a wealthy public accountant and hotheaded businessman who had a tempestuous relationship with his daughter. She studied at Abbotsleigh School and enrolled in an arts course, but opted out, citing a lack of Australian subject matter. Miles also enrolled in medicine, which was unusual for women at that time, but in the first year she contracted encephalitis lethargica. The disease permanently and profoundly changed her personality, but not her intelligence, such that she was unable to finish her studies and became an eccentric and notorious identity in and around Sydney. In 1923, tired of his daughter's bohemian behaviour and lifestyle, Miles' father had her committed to a hospital for the insane, in Glebe, New South Wales where she stayed for two years. After that Miles lived on the street and was known for her outrageous behaviour. She was arrested many times and claimed to have been \\"falsely convicted 195 times, fairly 100 times\\". For a while Miles was living in a cave behind one of the Sydney beaches. It was said that she always carried a A‚Ç§5 note pinned to her skirts, so that the police could not arrest her for vagrancy. Miles' most notorious escapades involved taxi drivers. She regularly refused to pay fares. Some drivers refused to pick her up and she would sometimes damage the cab in retaliation, including reputedly ripping a door off its hinges once. In 1955, Miles took a taxi to Perth, Western Australia and back. This time she did pay the fare, A‚Ç§600. It is also said she would sit in a Sydney bank smoking cigarettes under a sign reading \\"Gentlemen will refrain from smoking\\". Music-lovers who attended the regular free Sunday-afternoon concerts given in the Sydney Town Hall by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra may recall how, just before the performance began, Miles often appeared and wandered down the centre aisle, calling out \\"Ruby? Ruby?\\" Miles was well-educated, and very widely read ‚Äì she was legendary as a fast and voracious reader throughout her life, even in her declining years, and reputedly read an average of two books every day. She spent a lot of time in the State Library of New South Wales reading books, until finally being banned in the late 1950s. Miles was also regularly seen standing on street corners with a sign offering to quote verses from Shakespeare for between sixpence and three shillings. Miles' writings are in the State Library, some in her own handwriting. They are: Dictionary by a Bitch, I Go on a Wild Goose Chase, I Leave in a Hurry, For We Are Young and Free, Notes on Sydney Monuments and Advance Australia Fair. Fiercely patriotic, at twelve years old Miles wore a 'No Conscription' badge to school during the referendum in World War I. In another incident Miles was disgusted when she was severely marked down for an essay about Gallipoli, which she described as a 'strategical blunder', rather than 'a wonderful war effort'. When ill health started to catch up with her, Miles finally stopped living on the streets, spending the last nine years of her life in the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged in Randwick. She supposedly told the sisters that she had \\"no allergies that I know of, one complex, no delusions, two inhibitions, no neuroses, three phobias, no superstitions and no frustrations\\". Miles died on 3 December 1973, aged 71, from cancer. Australian wildflowers were placed on her coffin, while a jazz band played \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" and \\"Advance Australia Fair\\". It was suggested that Miles had renounced her lifelong atheism and become a Catholic before her death, but her family do not support this claim. Miles is interred at Rookwood Cemetery in the family plot. Popular culture and media  As Miles was a well-known figure in Sydney society, in 1961 a portrait of her by Alex Robertson was entered for the Archibald Prize. A musical based on her life, Better known as Bee, was first performed in 1984. The 1985 novel Lilian's Story by Kate Grenville was loosely based on her life; and was turned into a movie in 1995 starring Toni Collette and Ruth Cracknell in the title roles. A fictionalised version of Miles briefly appeared as a minor character in the 1978 Australian drama film The Night the Prowler (which also starred Ruth Cracknell), directed by Jim Sharman with a screenplay by renowned author and playwright Patrick White. The \\"Miles\\" character ‚Äì a cameo role by famous Australian author Dorothy Hewett ‚Äì is not named, and is only briefly seen (in a park at night, talking with the main character), however she is dressed in a manner very similar to Miles' characteristic style, with a large overcoat, tennis shoes and sun visor.  Family legacy  Miles is the great-aunt of Matthew Miles, CEO of MS Research Australia.

Spencer (1921-1998) was a mystery author, best known for his series of comic novels that astutely satirized the private eye genre. Early life Spencer was born in Hughart, West Virginia, raised in Youngstown, Ohio, and moved back to Youngstown before he died. Spencer served with the 37th Infantry Division during World War II, during the Battle of New Georgia, on the , and in the Philippines, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star. After the war, he lived for a while in Chicago where he was an avid fan of the Chicago Cubs. During the \\"Korean Emergency,\\" he reenlisted in the military, this time in the Air Force. Writing career Spencer did not begin writing until after he had a heart attack in his fifties, after which he read a couple of mystery novels which he found amusing. He taught himself to write his special brand of funny mystery novels, beginning with The Dada Caper (1978). David Merrick optioned five of his novels for Broadway, though they never saw the stage. The Chance Purdue series spoofed the private eye genre, and was written with one sentence paragraphs and minimal punctuation, with chapters prefaced by quotes from the fictional pundit Monroe D. Underwood. Spencer was the author of fourteen novels starring hard-drinking Chicago private eye protagonists, including Lacey Lockington, Chance Purdue, Buzz Deckard, Luke Lassiter and Birch Kirby. One New York Times review described his writing as \\"including rat-tat-tat writing in which paragraphs are seldom more than one sentence...[and] the hero is a private eye who is always tailing the wrong people and hitting the wrong guys. Wild, shrewd mad and unexpectedly funny.\\" and \\"Ross H. Spencer has, up until now, been published only in paperback books that demonstrated a wacky humor and an equally wacky writing style. In The Dada Caper (1978) and The Reggis Arms Caper (1979), Mr. Spencer got his style down mostly to one- sentence paragraphs. The prose hurtled along. Neither book was serious, but Mr. Spencer had fun spoofing the crime genre, and he did so with unusual expertise.\\" Close friend, Ross Spencer was a great writer and fiend. A group of writers met at his home on Youngstown's west side. He helped me with my writing and made great suggestions to improve it. That basement, at 551 N. Dunlop Avenue, was a favorite spot for the writer gang, one of whom was Jim Fisher who wrote \\"The Lindbergh Case.\\" He typed all that writing on a word presser with two fingers with a Dutch Master cigar clenched between his teeth. I'd ask for a cigar box for some storage, and he's say, about ten? He gave me many autographed copies of his books, and his knowledge of history, music and many subjects was extensive. He graduated from Chaney High school in Youngstown and never attended college. Working on top of a blast furnace in Youngstown, in the middle of the night, atop the furnace, with a helper, making sure the hopper to feed the furnace was emptied, he threw the shovel over the side and told to his helper - That's it - I quit - I'm going back to Chicago.

He is the son of Cab Kaye, younger brother of Terri Quaye, and older half- brother of singer Finley Quaye. Early career Quaye was a member of local band The SoundCasters (Sound Castles) while at school. Quaye spent several years as a member of Long John Baldry's backing band, Bluesology, which also featured a keyboard player named Reg Dwight, who would soon become known as Elton John. When Bluesology disbanded in 1967, Quaye released a single under the name Caleb called \\"Baby Your Phrasing is Bad\\" b/w \\"Woman of Distinction\\" (1967, Philips Records). In 1969 he served as guitarist for the one-off \\"flower power\\" pop band Argosy (which also included Dwight, Roger Hodgson, and Nigel Olsson) on their single, \\"Mr. Boyd\\" b/w \\"Imagine\\".Joynson, Vernon (1995). The Tapestry of Delights . London: Borderline Books. See entry on \\"Argosy\\". Starting in 1969, Quaye played guitar supporting Elton John at live concerts around the local London area, with what eventually became the nucleus of Hookfoot for sporadic shows. The live support work continued until Elton formed his original touring band in the spring of 1970, the trio featuring Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson. In April 1970, Quaye formed the band Hookfoot with Ian Duck, Roger Pope and David Glover, all of whom were DJM Records house musicians and had backed Elton's earliest live performances. The group's self- titled debut album was a mix of rock and jazz and included songs by Quaye and Duck, in addition to Stephen Stills and Neil Young covers. Quaye played guitar and keyboards on this album. The group's follow-up record Good Times a-Comin' was a more straight-ahead rock album. A third album was Communication and the last album titled Roarin' . A live album called Hookfoot Live in Memphis, recorded in 1973 was released later. The group disbanded in 1974 and Quaye stayed in the United States to work as a session musician. He is credited as a guitarist on Bill Quateman's 1973 debut album, Bill Quateman and toured with Quateman in support of the album. Quaye played guitar, bass and drums on \\"Forever's No Time at All\\", written and sung by Nicholls. It opened I Am, a 1972 album dedicated to Meher Baba also featuring Pete Townshend. Later that year, the song appeared on Townshend's solo debut Who Came First. Quaye played guitar on the original demos for Joan Armatrading's debut album Whatever's for Us, which was released in November 1972. The demos were recorded by Gus Dudgeon at Marquee Studios, London. Subsequently, Caleb Quaye was enlisted by Billy Nicholls to play lead guitar, bass, drums and keyboards on Love Songs, recorded in 1974 and released on GM Records. Elton John Band Quaye first met Elton John in 1965, and in 1967 helped him to get studio time to record demos at Dick James' studio, where he worked as an engineer.Bernardin, Claude & Stanton, Tom (1996) Rocket Man: Elton John from A-Z, Greenwood Press, , p. 80 They played together in the Bread and Beer Band, and Quaye produced John's first solo single. Quaye played off and on for more than 10 years with John, both as a session player and later full band member, appearing on all of his earliest recordings and albums as a session player until the beginning of 1972, as well as being a member of Bluesology during 1967/68. He finally fully joined the Elton John Band in May 1975 for the Rock of the Westies and Blue Moves albums, as well as subsequent 1975/76 Elton tours. In 2019, an old and previously unreleased song he co-wrote with Elton John in the late 1960s, Thank You For All Your Loving, was featured in the film Rocketman. Hall & Oates In 1978, Quaye along with fellow Elton John Band members Kenny Passarelli and Roger Pope joined Hall & Oates. This group recorded Livetime as well as the September 1978 release Along the Red Ledge. Caleb also played on Daryl Hall's first solo album which also featured Passarelli, Pope, and Robert Fripp (King Crimson). Christian faith and music ministry In 1982, Quaye embraced the Christian faith becoming a musician/evangelist. From 1986 to 1995, Quaye was an Associate Pastor, Chief Musician and Staff Evangelist at the Foursquare Church in Pasadena, California. Since 1996, Quaye has served as the National Worship Director for the Foursquare denomination, ministering throughout the United States, England and Europe. Quaye used to serve as adjunct faculty at LIFE Pacific College in San Dimas, California, teaching music and worship leadership. He is also one of the elders in the church that meets in the chapel on campus. In February 2006, Vision Publishing released Quaye's autobiography, A Voice Louder Than Rock & Roll, in paperback. The book is credited to \\"Caleb Quaye with Dale A. Berryhill.\\" From 2008 on, Quaye released two jazz-rock fusion CDs. The first one was One Night in San Dimas, with Out of the Blue as the 2010 follow-up album; both of which he plays his signature model Brazen guitar, loaded with Seymour Duncan pick-ups.

Broadway in the historic Broadway Theater District in Downtown Los Angeles. History This Los Angeles Theatre was constructed in late 1930 and early 1931. It was commissioned by H.L. Gumbiner, an independent film exhibitor from Chicago, who also built the nearby Tower Theatre. Designed by S. Charles Lee, and Samuel Tilden Norton, the theater features a French Baroque interior. With its grand central staircase and gold brocade drapes, it has for many years been considered to be among the city's most lavish landmarks. The opulent interior is said to have been modeled after the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. A crystal fountain stood at the head of the grand staircase, and a restaurant and a ballroom were on the lower level. Construction was completed in less than six months and cost $1.5 million. Charlie Chaplin helped fund the completion so that it would be ready to open with the premiere of his film City Lights in January 1931. With only 30 days to go before the scheduled premiere, the entire theater was constructed off-site and swung in, slotted between the existing buildings. It was the last such movie palace built on Broadway, as the area began to feel the effects of the Depression and faced competition from Hollywood Blvd. as the \\"Great White Way of the West\\". Attendance was strong through World War II, when many factory workers would see shows before and after their shifts. With the postwar suburbanization of Los Angeles, attendance declined throughout the later decades of the 20th century. After closing its doors to the public in 1994, the Los Angeles has sat vacant for many years, although it can be rented as a venue for special events. The theater is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Los Angeles is used most often today as a location for filming, and is frequently seen in commercials, television shows, and feature films. It has been featured in Funny Lady (1975); New York, New York (1977); Man on the Moon (1999); Charlie's Angels (2000) and its sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003); The Lords of Salem (2012); the AMC series Mad Men; among many other films. The theatre was used in the back drop on the set of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and seen in the music video for \\"Safe and Sound (Capital Cities song)\\" (2013), \\"Shake It (Metro Station song)\\" (2008), \\"Jaded\\" by Aerosmith (2000), \\"Black Swan\\" by BTS (2020), and \\"2U\\" by Kang Daniel (2020). The theatre's fa√ßade and marquee design was used as the inspiration for that of the Hyperion Theatre at Disney California Adventure in Anaheim.

Interspersed among the many clips are interviews with Hiroshi Miyauchi, who played Shiro Kazami in Kamen Rider V3, and Kohji Moritsugu who played Dan Moroboshi in Ultra Seven. The final segment of the special is the short film \\"Super Battle: Ultraman vs Kamen Rider\\". The main characters, Ultraman and Kamen Rider 1 appear on the scene separately, each fighting an original kaijin and kaiju, Poison Scorpion Man and Gadoras respectively. When the two monsters are nearly defeated, they merge into a more powerful kaiju; Sasori Gadoras. Ultraman experiences trouble and calls for Kamen Rider 1's help. Kamen Rider 1 is then able to grow to an enormous size to fight alongside Ultraman. Combining their powers, the two were able to successfully destroy the monster.

The event occurred on a reverse fault near the north coast region of Papua New Guinea, from the coast near Aitape, and caused a large undersea landslide which caused a tsunami that hit the coast, killing between at least 2,183 and 2,700 people and injuring thousands.  Earthquake  The earthquake occurred at 6:49pm local time (UTC+10) along the boundary of the Australia and the Pacific tectonic plates. The tsunami was originally thought to have been caused by a vertical drop in the Pacific Plate along a long fault. Later work suggested that in fact a massive underwater landslide had occurred. The tsunami raised awareness among scientists of the potential for small earthquakes to trigger large tsunamis, if they cause undersea landslides. It is now recognised that such events can be very dangerous, as the earthquake may be too small to be felt on land, or detected by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Any resulting tsunami can thus appear without warning. Effects The earthquake consisted of a main shock and several aftershocks that were felt in several towns in the area around the epicenter. The main shock caused some minor damage to the 62-year-old church at the Sissano Mission, and was strong enough that many people in Malol, Arop, and Warapu left their houses because the shaking lasted for so long. Cracks in the ground formed in Arop and Warapu. Computer modelling of the earthquake and resulting landslide A few minutes after the earthquake, many residents reported hearing a loud clap as the tsunami approached the shoreline. The tsunami resulted in at least 2,200 people being killed, thousands being injured, about 9,500 homeless and about 500 missing. The maximum height of the waves was estimated at being 15 m (49 ft) high with an average height of 10.5 m (34 ft). The area worst hit was a coastal strip running north-west from Aitape to the village of Sissano. Several villages in the path of the tsunami were completely destroyed and others extensively damaged. The tsunami wave uprooted entire buildings and transported their foundations from their original location The village of Arop was situated on a narrow spit between the coast and Sissano lagoon. It was directly in the path of the tsunami and was worst hit. Response Immediately after the tsunami the Royal Australian Air Force flew in three C-130 Hercules transport planes with relief supplies. In the days following more relief was flown in and a field hospital was set up in the neighbouring town of Vanimo. The amount of injury and illness due to the tsunami overwhelmed the makeshift hospitals, leaving many victims with wounds that were untreated for several days and led to gangrene. Rotting dead bodies that remained in the lagoon spread diseases and the government sealed off the entire area. After the makeshift hospital in Vanimo was dismantled, the sick people became worse because the nearest hospital was over a day's walk away. Several villages moved their buildings slightly further back from the sea when they rebuilt.Tidal devastation: One year on BBC News July 16, 1999 Scientists from the University of Papua New Guinea initiated a public awareness program for the residents of the coastal area affected by the tsunami, to tell them that scientific models have concluded that the geology of the surrounding area causes the destructive waves to focus their energy on that area, making it a very dangerous place to live. The scientists also recommended that the Papua New Guinea government improve the escape routes for the villages and improve the tsunami warning system.Learning from the Aitape Tsunami The country does not have a communications plan put in place, according to the UN Development Project's country report on Disaster Management.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 17 January 1995. Angie departed in 1996, but she returned for several weeks in 2002, then for her youngest son, Toadie's wedding to Dee Bliss in 2003. The following year, Angie made another brief visit and she made a cameo in the 20th anniversary episode, which was broadcast in July 2005. The character returned again in 2006 and 2008. Baker reprised the role in February 2013, and again in August 2015. After a brief appearance in the Summer Stories webisodes in January 2017, Angie made guest returns in April, December 2017, 12 February 2018 and 11 March 2019. Casting Baker was initially brought into Neighbours for a couple of episodes, but when her character proved popular with viewers, she was taken on full-time. Of her time in the Neighbours, Baker told Jason Herbison of Inside Soap \\"Angie lived in Ramsay Street for two and half years and I had the time of my life. Even now, a lot of people say we were the most realistic family ever to be on the show.\\" In 2002, Baker agreed to return to Neighbours for brief stint as part of \\"emergency storylines\\", which were written to cover Madeleine West's (Dee Bliss) sudden absence. Baker reprised her role for the soap's 20th anniversary episode, which was broadcast in July 2005. Development A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website described Angie as being \\"salt of the earth\\" and a \\"rough diamond\\". They explained that she is \\"a devoted mother and tireless worker\\", though she could often be brash. Inside Soap's Jason Herbison said Angie was the source of much comic relief in Neighbours and he commented \\"Whether pulling sons, Toadie and Stonefish, into line or gossiping with the neighbours, she was always the centre of attention. Baker believed that above all, Angie was a good mother and always had her boys' best interests at heart. She later quipped \\"I just love Angie ‚Äì she's feisty. But, the whole point about her is that she's also absolutely, deadset genuine. She just doesn't have a lot of subtlety in the way she goes about things.\\" A writer for the official Neighbours website called Angie a \\"no nonsense character\\" and the \\"unconventional matriarch of the Rebecchi clan\\". In 2015, Baker admitted that Angie was \\"over the top but also very down to earth\\". She uses her common sense and is \\"warm-hearted\\". Despite being married to Kevin Rebecchi (Don Bridges), Angie had an affair with Mick Andrews (Mike Bishop), a possum catcher. Baker revealed that this was her favourite storyline and she recalled that it gave her the chance to play her first love scene. The actress explained \\"Me and Mike Bishop, who played Mick, both pretended we knew what to do - when neither of us did! When you're teenagers it's fine, but at our age - what do you do?\\" Angie and Mick's affair was short-lived and she eventually returned to Kevin. The BBC writer said Angie's heart always belonged to him and they called the couple \\"soul mates\\". On 12 January 2013, it was announced that Baker would be returning to Neighbours in February for a guest appearance. Baker was pleased to be asked back and commented that Angie was a popular character, who viewers had always identified with. The actress added that she was a little nervous for her first day back and had to watch some footage of her previous performances to get back into character. Of the character's return, executive producer, Richard Jasek, stated \\"Angie is one of those wonderful characters without even being conscious of it, causes strife from the moment she steps through the door and it's always lovely to have Lesley come visit us again.\\" Angie comes to Ramsay Street to visit her new granddaughter, Nell (Scarlett Anderson), causing Toadie to find \\"himself negotiating his way through a minefield of personality clashes.\\" Angie immediately makes her presence felt. She gets off on the wrong foot Toadie's partner, Sonya (Eve Morey), and they clash over their different parenting styles. Baker explained \\"Straight away, Angie starts telling Sonya how to do things with the baby, with the best intentions she always means well. Angie thinks she's more than with it, actually. Of course, she's also so excited to meet her grand-daughter.\\" Angie returned from 17 August 2015 to help nurse Toadie, following an accident that left him paralysed. Baker told Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that she loved bringing Angie back to Neighbours and had no problem getting back into character. Baker explained that Angie would initially be in denial about the severity of Toadie's condition, and that her way of coping was to \\"fix it and not dwell on worst case scenarios\\". Angie and Sonya clashed over Toadie's care. Baker said Angie did not dislike Sonya, but thought they had very different personalities. She said Sonya \\"overthinks things\\", while Angie is the opposite and often acts immediately without consulting anyone. Baker could see that Angie's actions were frustrating to Sonya, but she just wanted to help out and look after everyone. Baker was also joined by Anthony Engelmen, who plays Stonefish, and she commented that it was good to catch up with him and be around her two on- screen sons again. As well as caring for Toadie, Angie also realised that her niece's husband Kyle (Chris Milligan) had developed feelings for Sonya's lodger Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). Angie then clashed with Kyle's grandmother Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) and Baker told Kilkelly that both women wanted to be \\"top dog of the older generation\\". The character returned on 19 April 2017, following the breakdown of Toadie's marriage and elder son Shane's (Nicholas Coghlan) return to Erinsborough. Angie confronts Sonya over her break up with Toadie. She returned again on 11 March 2019 to attend Sonya's funeral. Storylines Angie, her husband Kevin \\"Big Kev \\"Rebecchi, and their three sons; Shane (Greg O'Meara), Kevin Jr. (Anthony Engelman) and Jarrod (Ryan Moloney) move into Number 32 Ramsay Street from West Waratah. Shane is soon uncovered as the Ramsay Street thief much to Angie's shame and the family move back to West Waratah. However, the family frequently appear on Ramsay Street due to the friends they have made and are back living in Number 32 by the end of the year. Angie later takes over the lease of the coffee shop when Mark Gottlieb (Bruce Samazan) relocates to Sydney. During Big Kev's absences due to him being a trucker, Angie finds herself lonely and begins enjoying the company of Mick Anderson, a pest exterminator. Toadie, Angie's youngest son becomes immediately suspicious and confronts her after he learns Mick kissed Angie but she assures him she and Mick are just friends and she still loves his father. After visiting Big Kev up North, Angie takes the decision to move the family to join him to open a roadhouse. Stonie, after splitting up with girlfriend Catherine O'Brien (Radha Mitchell) decides he has nothing lose and is in favour of the move. However, Toadie refuses to budge, Angie is hurt at first but understands and arranges with Karl (Alan Fletcher) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) to have Toadie live with them. Angie and Stonie bid farewell to Erinsborough and Toadie frequently visits them. Six years later, Angie and Kev return to Erinsborough where Toadie has arranged a surprise 30th wedding anniversary party for them at Lou's Place. Problems in the marriage are evident when Angie and Kev argue. Toadie and his housemate Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough) try to mediate the couple's squabbles. Angie later wins the lottery and Kev tries to keep her sweet in order to get his hands on the ticket she keeps in her bra. Kev later claims the winnings and skips town leaving a note saying he will see her in Rio leaving Angie devastated. After Kev suffers guilt over his actions and apologises, Angie plays him at his own game by pretending to run off with the money herself. The couple then buy a camper van and leave to reaffirm their marriage. When Toadie is due to marry Dee Bliss the following year, Kev, Angie and Stonie return for the event. Angie and Dee argue but soon put their differences aside. After Dee is presumed drowned in a car accident, Angie and Kev try to help Toadie out of his depression but are unable to and leave. Several months later Stuart phones Angie to tell her Toadie has gone missing and she returns to Erinsborough. Stuart and Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey) explain about Toadie having problems with his current girlfriend Sindi Watts (Marisa Warrington) previously being a lapdancer, Angie goes over to Number 28 where Sindi is living and confronts her but realizes that Toadie wouldn't leave after a revelation like that. After learning Toadie is safe, Angie prepares to leave but wants her 16-year-old nephew Stingray Timmins (Ben Nicholas) to return with her to Colac so his parents can resume responsibility for him, but Susan agrees to take Stingray on herself as she did with Toadie eight years previously. Angie appears in Annalise Hartman's (Kimberley Davies) documentary about Ramsay Street, praising Susan, Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) for being steadying influences in Toadie's life. A year later, Angie returns to Ramsay Street and helps Harold and Lou battle against Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), who has opened a rival restaurant to their General store. She battles sister-in-law Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney) verbally and later physically in a boxing match where Angie lands the knockout blow after Janelle is distracted. The reason for their animosity is revealed when Janelle mentions she had always resented Angie marrying and taking her big brother, Kev away from her. The two sisters-in-law bury the hatchet. Angie later attends Janelle's re-wedding to her husband Kim (Brett Swain) and helps delay the police when they come looking for Kim over illegal DVD sales. Two years later, Angie and Kev return for Toadie's wedding to Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) which is called off when Toadie realises Steph is not fully committed to marrying him. Angie tries to get Toadie to reconsider but he is adamant he will not. Angie and Kev then leave. Angie comes to Ramsay Street to visit her granddaughter, Nell, and to attend her naming day. Toadie tells Angie that the naming day has been postponed, before leaving her and his partner, Sonya, alone together. Sonya is not happy when Angie interferes and they start to clash over Nell's care, especially when Angie gives Nell formula milk. While she is in Harold's Store, Angie mentions to Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) that Toadie and Sonya have postponed Nell's naming day, so that it will not upset her because her own baby is in the hospital. The naming day goes ahead and afterwards, Toadie reveals that he has to go to Chile. Angie decides to stay longer to help Sonya with Nell, but Sonya feels that she is criticising and undermining her. When Angie spots Sonya taking some pills, she starts to worry that Sonya is on drugs. Sonya later catches Angie going through her bag and confronts her. Angie apologises, but Sonya asks her leave. Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) tries to get them to talk, but Sonya refuses. Angie states that she and Big Kev will not be coming to the wedding, before leaving for Colac. A couple of weeks later, Angie returns for the wedding and she and Sonya apologise to each other. When Angie learns that Toadie has suffered a fall and is paralysed, she returns to help care for him. She immediately starts fussing over her son, despite Sonya pointing out that she can care for her own husband. Sonya introduces Angie to her lodger Amy Williams and explains that Amy is creating a new floor plan to accommodate Toadie's wheelchair. Angie is surprised by the news, as Toadie had led her to believe he would be okay. When she notices the chemistry between Amy and Georgia's husband Kyle, Angie calls Georgia to ask when she will be returning home. Sheila Canning accuses Angie of flirting with her partner Russell Brennan (Russell Kiefel) and they fight. Angie advises Sonya to sue for compensation to help ease the family's financial troubles. After Angie picks Nell up from her first day at childcare, Sonya angrily confronts her and Angie decides to leave. After saying goodbye to Toadie, Angie goes back home. Angie returns after Toadie and Sonya separate, and sends Shane (now Nicholas Coghlan) to check on his brother. She visits again shortly after Shane and his wife Dipi Rebecchi (Sharon Johal) move their family to Ramsay Street. Angie clashes with Sonya and suggests Toadie should go for custody of Nell. Months later, Angie's granddaughter Yashvi Rebecchi (Olivia Junkeer) tells her about Sonya's neighbourhood Christmas party and the variety show, Angie comes to Erinsborough. She is furious to learn that Toadie has reconciled with Sonya. After Dipi tells her that she is in danger of missing out on family events, including Sonya's surprise vow renewal for Toadie, Angie apologises to Sonya and agrees to accept Toadie's decision. Angie attends Sonya's memorial, after she dies from ovarian cancer. When her grandson Callum Rebecchi (Morgan Baker) struggles with his speech, Angie gets up to help him, by saying that Sonya was a good mother. During the wake, Angie remarks to Shane and Dipi that she cannot believe Toadie is going through this again and tells him how upset Toadie was after losing Dee. Shane and Dipi reassure Angie that they are looking after him and the children. Reception When Baker first left the show, fans of her character launched a \\"Bring back Angie\\" petition and she was eventually reinstated.Johnston 2005, p.213. A writer for the BBC said Angie's most notable moment was \\"Kissing the possom man, Mick Andrews.\\" Jackie Brygel from TV Week branded Angie an \\"interfering, larger-than-life character.\\" Dianne Butler, writing for The Daily Telegraph, commented \\"Sonya might have to be careful - her mother-in-law Angie's done time on Prisoner. She'll know how to make a weapon out of soap. If it comes to that. I'm saying nothing.\\" A Sunday Mercury reporter branded the character \\"Awful Angie\\" and said she had a \\"big mouth\\". While Sasha Morris of the Daily Star dubbed Angie a \\"fan favourite\\". Simon Hughes of The Age was \\"enamored\\" of Angie and said that her \\"carborundum voice could strip a ship's bottom.\\" References * External links * Angie Rebecchi at the BBC Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Television characters introduced in 1995 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Angie Rebecchi"},{"id":"10417152","title":"I Want a New Drug"},{"id":"10417165","text":"Nathaniel Gould (21 December 1857 ‚Äì 25 July 1919), commonly known as Nat Gould, was a British novelist. History Gould was born at Manchester, Lancashire, the only surviving child of Nathaniel Gould, a tea merchant, and his wife Mary, n√©e Wright. Both parents came from Derbyshire yeomen families. The boy was indulgently brought up and well educated. His father died just before he was to have left school, and Gould tried first his father's tea trade and then farming at Bradbourne with his uncles. Gould became a good horseman but a poor farmer. In 1877, in reply to an advertisement, he was given a position on the Newark Advertiser gaining a good all-round knowledge of press work. After a few years he became restless, and in 1884 sailed for Australia, where he became a reporter on the Brisbane Telegraph in its shipping, commercial and racing departments. In 1887 after disagreements with the Telegraph management, Gould went to Sydney and worked on the Referee as \\"Verax\\", its horse-racing editor. Later Gould worked for the Sunday Times, and Evening News. Then followed 18 months at Bathurst as the editor of the Bathurst Times during which time he wrote his first novel, With the Tide, which appeared as a serial in the Referee. He returned to Sydney and the Referee and wrote another six other novels for the same paper. In 1891 his first novel, With the Tide, was published in book form in England under the title of The Double Event and was an immediate success; it sold over 100,000 copies in its first ten years and was still in print in 1919. It was dramatized in Australia and had a long run in 1893. In 1895 Gould returned to England; he had been 11 years in Australia and he felt that his experiences had made a man of him. Back in England, Gould returned to writing fiction, for many years writing an average of over four novels a year; about 130 are listed in Miller's Australian Literature. Gould also published in 1895 On and Off the Turf in Australia, in 1896 Town and Bush, Stray Notes on Australia; in 1900 Sporting Sketches; and in 1909 The Magic of Sport: mainly autobiographical. His novels attracted enormous public interest and his sales ran into many millions of copies. He travelled, retained his interest in racing to the end, and died on 25 July 1919. Nat Gould was buried at Bradbourne in Derbyshire on 29 July 1919, and his grave is marked by a stone cross near the churchyard gates. In April 1886 in Brisbane, he married Miss Elizabeth Madelaine Ruska, and there were seven children of the marriage. Gould was a modest man who did not take himself or his work too seriously. His advice to emerging writers was to 'write about men and things you have met and seen; take your characters from the busy world, and your scenes from Nature'. But within its limits his work was very good. He told a simple story exceedingly well in an unaffected way. Many of his books were concerned with horse racing, and no great originality of plot was to be expected, but they were written with such flair and genuine interest that their countless readers took up each book as it was published, confident in their belief that here was another rattling good story.

The characters as well as their names are loosely based upon the characters from the Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. For example, the character Hakufu Sonsaku is based on the historical figure Sun Ce (Sonsaku being the Japanese name for Sun Ce, Hakufu being the Japanese pronunciation for his courtesy name Bofu). The series revolves around Hakufu Sonsaku, a female fighter who attends Nanyo Academy with her male cousin Koukin Shuyu, where seven rival schools fight each other for supremacy in the Kanto region. Main schools=Nanyo Academy is a school named after Nanyang, which based on the Wu Kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period. The top-ranked fighters in Nanyo are known as the , which consists of Shimei Ryomou, Gakushuu, Kouha Kannei, and Genpou Saji. After Kannei's defeat, Koukin Shuuyu becomes one of the Big Four in his place. ; : :The protagonist of Ikki Tousen. A second-year transfer student at Nanyo, she is not terribly bright, but is immeasurably powerful despite being only a D-ranked fighter. Because of her busty physique and high skill, she is known by others as the , and is also known by her predecessor's title, the , due to her fate of conquering all of the rival schools. Hakufu cares little for the politics involved between the fighters, only caring about fighting for the sake of fighting, but is staunchly against unnecessary violence and killing. Lately, however, with trouble brewing all around her, she is beginning to take up the mantle of a leader to protect her friends and family. :Hakufu possesses a unique gift for predicting an enemy's moves very accurately by reading the flow of chi around her opponents, which occasionally makes her seem brighter than she is. For instance, she will put an end to a fight simply by stating the next moves of an opponent with frightening accuracy, breaking his will to fight after he realizes the futility of fighting her. She is also very good at \\"delayed striking\\", where she makes a feint attack in order to leave an invisible \\"chi bomb\\" which detonates moments later while the enemy's guard is down. She is skilled at \\"inner striking,\\" which is another chi attack where she sends her chi into a person, causing damage to manifest at unusual places. She also inherited Master Chosho's knowledge of chi magic, and, while currently unaware of this, is able to use it partially by instinct. Chosho passed it to her spiritually while Hakufu was unconscious; this is how she healed Koukin after she stabbed him; she slept with Koukin and extracted the evil chi from his body into her own (an uncommon method). She still has the evil chi contained inside her, and it appears on her body as a skull-like mark and is slowly creeping up to her heart. :Hakufu harbors a powerful dragon as one of the Three Great Rulers (the founders of the Three Kingdoms, along with Sousou and Ryubi). Before joining Nanyo, Hakufu lived with her mother, Goei, outside of Kanto where she, like the samurai, practiced things like flower arrangement and the tea ceremony while training heavily in martial arts. Goei was hoping to spare Hakufu her fate, but after Hakufu pummeled a traveling fighter looking for easy prey, they moved in with Koukin. She is very girlish and happy-go-lucky but is capable of wisdom despite having very bad luck. For instance, in one scene where she is just about to deliver a finishing blow to Kannei, her panties get caught on a branch, tripping her over. Nanyo has officially declared Hakufu to be their ruler. She learned the Water Dragon Fist attack from Choukou with the help of Rikuson and Saji, but has apparently killed Saji who was under the guise of Ouin. After Saji's death, she has become more \\"leader-like\\", though her airheaded nature still shows. :Hakufu's anime incarnation portrays her as a low ranked and low skilled fighter, and has demonstrated none of her unique fighting gifts or chi powers and is arguably more stupid. In addition to her stupidity, she is more prone to doing dumber things, and either does not mind or is unaware of people harassing or hitting on her. She relies heavily on her dragon or her personal skill alone, and even when possessed by her dragon, she is easily stopped by the other main characters she fights before any damage can be dealt, as opposed to her manga counterpart which is extremely difficult to stop and required the aid of artifacts. She also does not inherit Master Chosho's chi magic (who does not exist in the anime); instead, she undergoes training with Ukitsu's master Chokou. She is possessed by Totaku at the end of the first season but is saved by her dragon who devours him. :In Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny, her role is reduced to a minor character, but became a major player in the Battle of Red Cliffs. She was not portrayed to be as idiotic as the first season, and is actually more of a ditzy character than an idiot. Upset at being the cause for much of the violence in Kanto, she traveled to Kyosho to challenge Sousou to a duel in order to end the conflict. She had to take on Kanu instead, who took Sousou's place,and during the fight, Hakufu became possessed by her dragon. Sousou appeared while in full control of his own dragon and dealt a powerful blow that sent Hakufu flying out of the area, leaving all three schools to think she was killed. Her unconscious body was discovered in a lake by Hakugen, who brings her to Chokou. He performed a revival on Hakufu's body but was only able to wake her dragon. Ukitsu gave her life in order to revive Hakufu's soul. Hakufu thus recovered and gained complete control of her dragon. She returned at the Battle of Chibi to fight Sousou, where she and Ryuubi teamed up and defeated Sousou. At the end of the series, Hakufu and Ryomou now work at a cosplay cafe, dressed as cat maids, and hopes to use the money to go on a \\"battle tour\\" around the world. She returns as a main character in Great Guardians, and is able to resist Genpou Saji's (the \\"real\\" Saji) genjutsu. ; : :Ryomou is a third-year student at Nanyo Academy. She is an odd girl with short blue hair and green eyes, a distinctive beauty mark on her left cheek, and a very strange history, mainly tied to her mysterious left-eye patch, and is always seen wearing fingerless gloves and combat boots. Powerful and a B-rank, she is also one of Nanyo's Big Four. She has a habit of wearing a blue miniskirted French maid outfit, and specializes in submission wrestling moves, throws, and joint attacks which she uses in conjunction with a pair of handcuffs she carries, and is also very proficient in making chi blasts. Her earlier life before she became a fighter is unknown, but is hinted as being tragic and painful. She, Teifu, and Saji have been best friends long before the start of the series, and Ryomou is in love with Saji and cares for Teifu (who loves her). Ryomou has always fought for the fun of it, and considers herself no one's woman. Presumably because of her dragon, she has a minor split personality; one is fairly shy and normal and the other is psychosexual. Her psycho side is not nearly as bad as Ryubi, Sousou and Hakufu. :Three years prior to the start of the series, Ryomou fought Ryuubi when her dragon had awakened, and saved her life right before Ryuubi attempted to rip her own heart out. In the process, Ryuubi's dragon possessed Ryomou's left eye, and now perfectly coexists with her. Its power even healed her completely after being mortally wounded and stabbed through the heart by Teni. No other characters seem to be in harmony with their dragons as much as Ryomou, but she still seals it with her eye-patch and is believed to be dying because of it. Very few are aware of this, and it is not stated whether she shares Ryuubi's dragon or now has her own. While she has it, she is as powerful as the other Three Rulers. Her magical eye may be a reference to the Chinese idiom \\"To look at a person with a new eye,\\" or reevaluate them or not to judge them by their appearance, an idiom attributed to Lu Meng who was as brilliant a scholar as he was a warrior. :In the anime series, Ryomou is much more taciturn and serious than her manga counterpart to the point of being almost unemotional, and is not shy or spoony and acts uninterested in relationships (in one scene, she is not even phased when Saji puts his hand down her shirt and gropes her). Her magatama is also shown as being silver in the first season, and by the second season she is arguably as strong as Kakouen, though she retreats during their first battle in order to protect the Dragon Jade. She does not have a past relationship to Seito and Ryuubi either, instead her dragon appears to be her own, though how she got it remains unknown. She also appears to be closer to Hakufu than she does in the manga, and goes out of her way to help the Nanyo leader whenever she can; in Dragon Destiny, she even went out on her own to find the Dragon Jade to save Hakufu. She was badly injured after being ambushed by Teni until Chouun came to her rescue, but Ryomou awakened her own dragon, defeating Teni. Choun was able to knock out Ryomou, bandage her, and return her to Nanyo after stealing the Dragon Jade. Choun stated that if Ryomou had not been injured during the awakening of her dragon, Ryomou might have been able to defeat her. Ryomou recovered to full strength and played a part in the Battle of Red Cliffs, defeating Kakouen. She is now working along with Hakufu in a cosplay cafe, dressed as a cat-eared maid and wearing a heart-shaped eye-patch, though she and Hakufu lost that job and numerous others in Great Guardians because of Ryomou's clumsiness and beating on customers. Ryomou's dragon, unlike Hakufu's, did not go back into hibernation after Red Cliffs, and it is revealed to be killing her. ; : :Hakufu's rich cousin and a second-year student at Nanyo Academy. He is an attractive pretty boy, as both Kanu (Tokyopop translation only) and Ukitsu have expressed exclusive interest in him (this trait was toned down in the anime). Although only a C-ranked fighter, his lack of confidence and his short resume of victories (or battles for that matter) keep him from becoming A-ranked despite already having the power of one. He has a crush on his cousin Hakufu and is generally shy and well-meaning, making life very difficult for him. Oddly, Hakufu does not seem to mind being naked around him, which shows how much she is really connected with him, but at times she thinks he is a pervert whenever he is caught in an embarrassing situation (such as Hakufu catching him staring at her things). He is now one of Nanyo's Big Four, taking Kannei's place after he was defeated. :Koukin has demonstrated some great power when he defended Hakufu and Kakouton from the Ugan gang, which astonished even Kakouton. He stayed behind to fight and eventually was captured, allowing the other two to escape. While being held captive in Kyosho, he was seduced by three beautiful girls (one of them being Seito's spy, Shokan, who reveals her identity to him afterwards) in an attempt to make Koukin betray Nanyo and fight for Sousou. This is, in fact, part of the plan for the Battle of Red Cliffs; with Koukin personally enacting \\"the plan of bodily harm.\\" Once the Kyosho forces are scattered in the battle he breaks free, easily defeating Kaku and Gakushin. He is currently trying to locate the separated Nanyo and Seito forces in order to take command, as per his fate in the battle. :In the anime, he is the only character whose after- episode biography in the first season poked fun at him, saying that after he got lost in a forest, Hakufu nicknamed him \\"The Lost Koukin\\", and as a child, he was called \\"Crybaby Koukin\\" by other children because he always cried when others bullied him, and Hakufu was usually there to protect him from bullies. Koukin was unable to stop Hakufu's dragon when she fought Ukitsu; instead he got pummeled to near death in the attempt only to have Hakufu stop her dragon on her own. In Dragon Destiny, after hearing of Hakufu's supposed demise, he blames Koumei for manipulating the events that led to Hakufu's fight with Sousou. However, Kanu proved to him that it was Hakufu's choice to challenge Sousou, and her fight with Kanu was one out of respect as fighters and not out of hatred. This led to Nanyo and Seito forming an alliance to face Kyosho. He returns to being a student after the Battle of Red Cliffs. ; / : :A third-year student at Nanyo Academy with blond hair and a light tan, and one of Nanyo's Big Four. He is one of Ryomou's oldest friends (whom he refers to as \\"Mou- chan\\"), and has feelings for both her and Housen Ryofu; even so, he is also a complete womanizer. His actual ranking as a fighter is unknown, as he never actually wears his magatama in public, but in fights he has shown himself to be an A-rank easily. One of his primary goals as Ouin was to remove Totaku from power, which, like his historical namesake, he accomplishes by convincing Ryofu to assassinate him. :In order to further Hakufu's mastery of the Water Dragon Fist, Saji fully donned the magatama and identity of Ouin, granting him great power and also slightly altering his appearance. Engaging Hakufu in deadly combat, he intentionally awakens her dragon, then, using his experience with Ryuubi's dragon three years ago, absorbs the dragon's negative energy into himself, snapping Hakufu back to normal and placing the dragon's power completely under her control, though at the cost of losing one of his arms in the process. Infected with the dragon's evil and knowing he does not have much time left, he declares that he is no longer Saji but Ouin, and that he has already lived longer than he should have. Telling Hakufu not to cry for someone like him, he commits suicide by jumping off a nearby cliff in a manner eerily similar to Totaku's death, his last thoughts of Ryofu. At the same time, even though she was far away, Ryomou is suddenly struck with the knowledge that Saji would not be coming back. :In the anime adaptation, he is more sinister, even going so far as to have Kannei murder Enjutsu in order to take control of Nanyo for himself, the act of which driving Kannei insane. He has the power to hypnotize and control the minds of humans, treating them more like pawns than friends. He is more obsessed with Totaku's demise, and tried to take control of Hakufu as well, but failed when Totaku tried to possess her and was eaten by her dragon. He resolves to atone afterwards, and has secluded himself in the mountains somewhere. He reappears in Dragon Destiny in order to stop Koukin from traveling to Kyosho to stop Hakufu from fighting Kanu. When he returns, he immediately goes back to his womanizing ways, flirting with Ryomou, Ryuubi, Chouhi, and Bashoku at separate points in the anime. He and Ryomou defeat Myousai at the Battle of Red Cliffs, and returns to his womanising ways again at the end of the series. :It is revealed in Great Guardians that there really is another fighter who goes by the name of Genpou Saji, revealing that Saji's name was actually not an alias. The real Saji meets with him and in exchange for reviving Ryofu, wanted to obtain Ryomou's dragon by putting on a lover's \\"act\\" for Ryomou, in order to build up her jealous emotions so that her dragon would be released. Ouin, for the most part, went with the plan. However, it was to save not only Ryomou and Ryofu but Saji himself as well. ; : :Called \\"Gaku-chan\\" by Hakufu, he is a third- year student at Nanyo Academy, a B-ranked fighter, and one of the Big Four. A large, muscular man with a scary face but a very nice personality, he is man of honor to the very core, and prides himself in this and in his rippling muscles, but usually gets beaten by all but the weakest of opponents. He learned how to use chi blasts after Ryomou blasted him through a wall without even twitching. Despite his strength and training, his skill is far poorer than that of Ryomou and Ryofu's, as shown when he blasted Kakouen who still got up afterwards. Though he is helping Nanyo with their alliance with Seito, he is pessimistic about their chances, such as when he commented the plan of bodily harm could not work since Kogai had been killed earlier. He later assists along with Saji and Rikuson to test Hakufu's worth as leader of Nanyo, and has no serious involvement since then. :Gakushuu plays a slightly more important role in the anime than in the manga, serving as a sort of de facto commander when Enjutsu and Saji go silent. He even investigates Enjutsu's odd behavior, and is the first to find out he is dead but is captured by Kannei. He gets beaten even more than in the manga, only to miraculously recover an episode later. He is also shown to have a sweet tooth, and even holds a meeting with Koukin in an ice cream shop. In Dragon Destiny, he becomes a lot tougher and was able to have an even fight with Kakouen. At the end of the series he gets a job in a store, but risks getting fired for throwing a customer through a window when he would not stop harassing a woman. ; :; Jonas Ball (English) :A long-time friend of Saji and Ryomou. He was once a strong fighter and was well respected by others. He often bullied Enjutsu even though it was Enjutsu who was the leader of Nanyo at the time. He has had feelings for Ryomou for as long as they knew each other. Enjutsu got his revenge when he and Kaku tricked Teifu into awakening Ryuubi's dragon, and led Teifu to believe Ryomou would be raped if Teifu would not obey him. :A few years later, Teifu was chosen to be one of Nanyo's representatives for the Grest Fighters Tournament, and suffered a horrible beating in a match that left him in a coma. He would have been killed if Ryomou had not interfered in the match, causing him to be disqualified. Teifu recovered from his coma but is now blind and nowhere near fully recovered. Teifu still jokes about blaming Ryomou for getting him disqualified. When Ryomou is left doubting her abilities after losing to Hakufu, Teifu offers her some much needed encouragement. In the anime, Teifu keeps his injuries and also his feelings for Ryomou. However, he does not appear at all in Dragon Destiny, which is where Ryomou discovered her own dragon. ; : :A cute, bespectacled junior at Nanyo Academy who is skilled in making poisons. She has recently joined the Nanyo gang with the intention of helping them beat Sousou. According to Lu Xun's history (both in the manga and from other sources), Lu Xun is sometimes credited with the defeat of Guan Yu, not Lu Meng. The manga states that Rikuson defeated Kanu and Ryuubi per Ryomou's orders, but history books variably give full credit to either Lu Meng or Lu Xun for coming up with the plan that led to the defeat of Guan Yu's forces (although in any case both are very important to this victory). History also states that Rikuson was Ryomou's proteg√© and eventual successor. Rikuson refers to Ryomou as her big sister in the English translation, although it is not confirmed if they are related. She is currently trying to help the Nanyo/Seito alliance during the Sekiheki battle, but also is slightly panicked due to the forces being separated and not in communication. :In Dragon Destiny, although she is still a student in Nanyo, Hakugen is only seen with Ukitsu and Chokou in the anime, where it is revealed she was also trained by the latter. She was also the person who found Hakufu unconscious in a river after her battle with Sousou. She visits Ukitsu's grave with Chokou at the end of the series, and now helps Chokou train young fighters. ; / : :Anime- exclusive character :An anime-exclusive character who appears in Great Guardians. She is introduced as the younger sister of Hakufu under the name of Chuubo Sonken, but later tells them that her name is in fact Shokyo. She often quotes military strategist Sun Tzu. It is implied that she might have feelings for Koukin, as she is his \\"destined wife.\\" Unlike her sister Hakufu, Shokyo is very polite, shy, gentle, and is very skilled at cooking. It is also pointed out by many characters in the series that Shokyo does not look like her sister at all. She confesses her feelings for Koukin, but he turns her down gently and tells her to not let destiny rule her life. She accepts that very gracefully, also deducing Koukin's love for Hakufu. She joins Hakufu's fight with the real Saji, whom she bravely speaks to and helps get over her problems and traumas. ; :The former leader of Nanyo and once Totaku's lapdog, a complete weakling at that. Kakouen mutilated his face when she attacked Nanyo looking for the Gyokuji. He played a role in Ryubi's first awakening of her dragon three years before the start of the series. Kaku offered to help Enjutsu get revenge on Teifu for pushing him around, and staged a phony video of Enjutsu's henchmen about to rape Ryomou (Kaku in disguise) and showed it to Teifu, threatening they would go ahead with the rape if he would not obey Enjutsu. When Teifu fell for the trick, Enjutsu sent him to assault Seito and attack Ryubi, eventually leading to her dragon awakening. He is currently presumed dead. In the anime, he is killed by Kannei under Ouin's orders prior to the series' start, driving Kannei insane, and only his withered corpse is seen. ; : :One of Nanyo Academy's Big Four. A pervert and a highly dishonorable fighter, he specializes in using a pair of tonfas with hidden blades. Myosai used a pressure point move on him that would kill him in ten days, and promised to remove the effect if Kannei would kill Hakufu but has failed to do this so far. He interrupts the Seito group's attack during the battle, having been possessed by Ryofu's magatama. He shows none of her personality, but has her vicious will to fight. He is finally stopped by Taishiji. :In the anime adaptation, he is crazier than his manga counterpart, and can be best described as a deranged chimpanzee. Ouin drives him insane by making him kill Enjutsu prior to the start of the series. He then hypnotizes Kannei into believing Enjutsu is still alive, and gives him orders which he suicidally follows. He is confined to an asylum at the end of the first season where he still remains. However, after Bashoku's framing of Kannei for the death of Kakuka in Dragon Destiny, he mysteriously vanished from this confinement, which led Koukin and Gakushuu into suspecting Seito may have been involved. ; :A student from Nanyo wearing many bandages, her injuries never explained. She first appears in the manga among the Nanyo gang to announce that Kanu has been captured by Sousou, and comes up with a plan involving Nanyo and Seito to team up and launch a surprise attack on Koushou. She does not appear in the anime adaptation, so far, though she makes a brief cameo in the last episode of the Dragon Destiny OVA and also is seen as a background character in the fourth Xtreme Xcuters OVA. ; :A student at Nanyo who appears in the last chapters of volume 13, when Hakugen calls her to help Hakufu to wake up from her unconsciousness. She is last seen in an animal-carehouse. ; : :The retainer of the Ou Family. In the anime, he is seen in a flashback when Ouin decided to disguise himself as Genpou Saji. Ouin told him that how he escaped the fate (in the novel, after Dong Zhuo's death, Wang Yun and Shisun Rui are killed by his followers Li Jue and Guo Si). ; : :The leader of a perverted sect within Nanyo who had watched the girls come to and from Nanyo everyday, noting from their crude observation of Chubou's breast size and comparing those to Hakufu's. He and his gang appear in a single episode of Great Guardians where they abduct Chubou to lure Hakufu out and take pictures of her. However, when he tries to rape her, he is defeated by Hakufu and her friends. In his backstory, he planned to succeed Enjutsu. Kyosho Academy is a school named after Xuchang, which based on the Wei Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms period. Its leader is Moutoku Sousou. ; : :The eccentric leader of Kyosho Academy, best friend to Genjou and Houkou, and a B-ranked fighter. Until his dragon awoke, he did not care much for the state of affairs, but afterward he became extremely violent, blood-thirsty, and power-mad because due to the dragon's influence. However, he is more interested in controlling powerful fighters than getting precious artifacts such as the Gyokuji and the Hyakuhekito. When Kanu refused to be freed in return for Ryubi surrendering the Gyokuji, Sousou happily accepts Kanu's request and orders the Gyokuji to be returned. Sousou often criticizes Kaku for wearing glasses, telling her she looks cuter without them. Easily the strongest character at the moment. He also has strange dreams involving an old man with writing on his forehead asking Sousou to avenge him. Despite Shibai's plan to keep him away from the Battle of Red Cliffs no matter what, his dragon pulls him forcibly towards the battle, as his dragon strongly desires to combat Ryubi and Sonsaku. :In the anime, he is less sinister a character, and instead seems more like a disturbed and troubled man trying to fight his dragon. He is much calmer and more caring until his dragon awoke. When Kanu was captured and taken prisoner, Sousou broke her out and persuaded her to join him. Kanu proved herself by fighting Hakufu one-on-one. Sousou was watching the fight on top of a nearby building and when Hakufu spotted him, she charged at him using the power of her dragon. Sousou countered with his own dragon and blew Hakufu a great distance away. While in his dragon state he almost killed his best friend, Kakouton. He was chained to a wall while being watched over by Chukou to prevent him from killing anyone else. In the Battle of Red Cliffs, he merged with Shibai's evil powers and he attempts to kill Ryuubi. He was defeated, and presumably killed, by Hakufu and Ryubi. In an episode of Great Guardians, Sousou is revealed to be alive, appearing out of nowhere behind Kakouen. After seeing him, Kakouen breaks into tears and Sousou comforts her, perhaps showing that he really does treasure Kakouen. ; : :A fighter known for his love of using only the most basic moves in combat, abhorring (and perhaps being incapable of) any other kind of combat. An honorable but eccentric young man, and currently studying civil engineering, he goes to great lengths to repair the damage done to any place he fights, patching walls and pavement and believing such a place to be a dojo he must maintain. He is a very good friend of both Sousou and Kakuka and has a crush on Hakufu, who is on very good terms with him. Like his predecessor, Kakouton had his left eye gouged out this time by a kunai-wielding assassin (Xiahou lost his eye to an archer), trying to defend Sousou before his dragon awakened. He is affectionately referred to as by Hakufu. :In the first anime season, Goei told him how to beat Hakufu during the Great Fighter's Tournament, and helped him by distracting her daughter while Kakouton injured her legs. Goei also flirted with him continually, leading most of the fighters to conclude that he likes mature women, a belief he vehemently denies to no avail. He still likes Hakufu, who is jealous of her mother and angry with him because she believes the rumors. In Dragon Destiny, he is portrayed as a much more serious character as compared to the first season. Like his manga counterpart, he has his eye gouged out but by a needle hidden in the assassin's mouth. After being ordered by Sousou to avenge Kakuka's death, he decided to do it his own way instead of attacking in a way that betrays his beliefs. Kakouton had been growing aware of the increasing blood-thirsty behavior of Sousou's Dragon and Sousou becoming extremely violent more often, and decided to confront the \\"Devil King\\". Unfortunately, he was overpowered and was presumed to be killed by Sousou. In the end, Kaku finds him sitting alone in a street, though he is now suffering from amnesia and only remembers Kakuka and Sousou as his friends and allies. :Kakouton is seen trying to regain his memories in an episode of Great Guardians, and meets Ryofu on a bus doing the same. Kakouton decides to go with Ryofu to help her and maybe himself. Kakouton meets Saji/Ouin and tells him that Kakouen can help him with his memories. Ryofu passes out and Kakouton tries to help her but is stopped by Kakouen. Hakufu shows up to stop Kakouen's next attack and triggers some of Kakouton's memories of when they first met. Kakouton finally stands up for himself, throwing away his backpack which has his repair kit in it. Hakufu reminds Kakouton how important that kit is to him and finally remembers everything. Kakouton then defeats Kakouen, telling her that he will find his own way to Sousou. ; : :A third-year student at Kyosho Academy and the best friend to Sousou and Kakouton. He was destined to die of cancer, but somehow was cured. He oddly flickered like a ghost around Kaku, his sweetheart. Reasonably strong and highly manipulative (perhaps even against Sousou himself), he was put into a coma by Yojo Bashoku, who framed Kannei of Nanyo for the attack. In the anime, he did not suffer from cancer and was killed by Bashoku in Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny instead of being put into a coma. He is stabbed in the heart rather than in the back, and dies from his wounds. He was much stronger as well, being able to defeat Ryomou very easily in the first season. Bashoku had to resort to poisoning before being able to kill him. Later in the story, it was revealed that Koumei of Seito, knowing that Sousou would want vengeance, arranged for Kakuka's murder in Kannei's name for several reasons: to divert Kyosho attacks away from Seito, to weaken Kyosho as they attempt to attack both Seito and Nanyo, and to make Nanyo more receptive to the possibility of an alliance with Seito when the time is right. To this day, very few people know the circumstances behind Kakuka's death. Koumei and Bashoku kept their role in Kakuka's death a secret, but Saji of Nanyou guessed the truth. ; : :A third-year student at Kyosho Academy who launched an assault on Seito. She was given one of the Hyakuhekit≈ç to use in battle, but her gang could not get past Kanshou. She tried to distract Kansho by flashing her shorts in front of him but he knocked her out instead, her own men attributing that she looked too boyish for that plan to have worked. Personality-wise, Soujin is a tomboy who easily loses her temper when insulted, especially when her feminity is concerned. :Soujin plays a major role in Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor. In the beginning, she was present at Kyosho during Bachou Mouki's attempt to fight Sousou. Later, she was chosen as one of two Kyosho representatives (the other being Kyocho Chuukou) sent to participate at a tournament on Nanban Island, which was actually a trap. Captured by Nanban fighters, Soujin was the one who identified Teni among the attackers, giving the viewers a clue to the identity of the mysterious Kentei. According to Koukin, Soujin is a B-rank fighter who is in charge of leading and managing low-ranking Kyosho fighters. ; : :A very tall first-year student at Kyosho Academy and one of Sousou's loyal fighters; she was easily able to block a powerful chi blast from Sousou aimed towards Shibai. Although Chuukou plays for Kyosho's volleyball team, she is also part of the school's stitching club and is wanted for the judo club. Chuukou and Sousou used to be in a judo club when they were younger, but due to her staggering height for her age, she was picked on and assumed to be a male by the other male club members. After what could be called an attempted molestation (being that the judo club members used force to reveal whether or not she was male or female), Sousou walked in and his dragon manifested itself. He easily slaughtered all that were there in an attempt to protect his friend. After regaining consciousness, Chuukou embraced Sousou and calmed his rage. Because of this, Chuukou resolved to protect him even if it cost her life to do so. She also possesses the largest bust size of all the female fighters, measuring 99cm in circumference. :In Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny, she is ordered by Shibai to keep an eye on Sousou if he becomes too powerful. Chuukou is one of the participants of the Battle of Red Cliffs. After that battle, she returns to playing for her volleyball team. :In Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor, Chuukou fights Bachou Mouki during her attempt to confront Sousou. When the tournament on Nanban Island is announced, she is chosen as one of two representatives of Kyosho, along with Soujin, for the tournament. When Nanban warriors ambushed the would-be contestants on a boat, Chuukou and Mouki eluded capture and swim to Nanban Island, where the two former opponents gradually make peace with each other as Chuukou describes Sousou to Mouki from her own point of view. Later, Chuukou and Mouki meet with Hakufu during an attempt to rescue the imprisoned fighters. Chuukou helps to fight off numerous Nanban fighters during the final battle and is later seen with Sousou and her comrades when they recover Teni. ; : :A female assassin Sousou once saved, earning her total loyalty. She is extremely skilled, even more so than Ryofu (however this may have been due to Ryofu's illness had reached its final stages at the time they fought), and very durable to the point of seemingly not feeling any pain, and specializes in pressure point attacks. She uses a jade shot attached to a very long metal wire as a projectile and for restraining her foes. She develops a deep respect for Choun when they fought each other, and Choun recognizes that Kakouen is fighting for someone who is very important in her life (Sousou). Kakouen attacks her own allies when they catch Ryubi, claiming that she wanted to capture Ryubi herself, but was stabbed from behind by one of Sousou's fighters. However, Choun defeated the fighter and ordered him to bring Kakouen back to Kyosho safely. :In Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny, it is revealed that Sousou found her years ago in a war zone of a jungle somewhere, presumably in Southeast Asia. Kakouen was dressed in army fatigues, suggesting she was a rebel or revolutionary of some sort, and she was nearly raped by a soldier (she was not wearing any pants and her underwear has been pulled down). The soldier is shown with a bullet wound in his back, which suggests either Kakouen killed him herself or Sousou did to save her (he is not shown holding any weapons, but Kakouen is holding a gun). Sousou was dressed as a tourist at the time he saved her, and it is presumed that he took her back to Japan with him. Kakouen was defeated by Ryomou and Saji in the Battle of Red Cliffs, and was also the only Kyosho fighter whose fate was not revealed in the anime's ending. :In Ikki Tousen: Great Guardians, Kakouen is revealed to be alive and in charge of Kyosho Academy due to the absence of Sousou and Kakouton. In the aftermath of the Battle of Red Cliffs, she seemed determined to restore Kyosho's former glory and power and was desperately searching for any sign of her beloved leader Sousou. When approached by a mysterious girl (the real Genpou Saji) with a deal to recover the missing Kakouton, Kakouen warily accepted. Afterwards, Kakouen worked with Ouin and distracted Kakouton while Ouin made off with Ryofu. As she was about to finish Kakouton, she was interrupted by Hakufu. In the end, Kakouen was defeated by Kakouton, who tells her that he will find his own way to Sousou and return to Kyosho when he is ready. Later, under the influence of the real Saji's genjutsu, she viciously fights Kakouton and Koukin, only to be interrupted by Sousou's return which breaks her hypnotized state. She then returned to Kyosho with Kakouton and Sousou. :Before the events of Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor, Kakouen returned to her home country for unknown reasons. She is seen along with Sousou and others after they recover Teni. ; : :The strategist of Kyousho Academy and arch- nemesis of Koumei. She is paraphelgic, having lost her feet years ago while Ten'i went on a killing rampage, and uses a wheelchair for mobility. She also has a dragon tattoo on her right hand (in the anime, they glow whenever she uses her chi or senses a strong opponent). Teni looked up to Shibai and called her \\"Maria-sama\\" (Lady Maria), treating her as a divine higher power. Shibai is secretly running Kyosho and is also Sousou's lover. She is secretly manipulating Sousou towards an ill-defined goal, and shows no signs of sympathy towards her loyal fighters. For example, she did not show any remorse towards Teni after she was horribly injured by Ryomou during their battle. She was almost killed by Sousou during one of his dragon stages but was saved just in time by Kyocho. :In Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny, she plans to send the world into chaos by using Sousou and other evil spirits. During the Battle of Red Cliffs, she attempted to run over her enemies in a car but crashed. It was during this she revealed that she could still actually walk, her crippleness was thought to be a deception tactic. She attacked Ryubi but was cut down by Kanu. She merged her powers with Sousou and her physical body crumbled away. It is also a thought that after the Battle of Red Cliffs, her spirit was somehow reborn with the ashes around her into the main antagonist of Xtreme Xecutor, Kentei (ÁçªÂ∏ù, the equivalent of Xian Di). This is thought because in an episode, Teni is seen in the Chapel asking for her \\"Maria-sama\\" to return. Seconds later, a cloaked figure appears and Teni says, \\"I knew you would return.\\" :It is later revealed by Kentei in volume 18, chapters 121 & 122 of the manga that Shibai's real name is , the Japanese equivalent of Wei Feng who was a minor figure in Ancient China. ; : :A psychotic powerful archer and assassin barely in her teen years, wearing gothic lolita fashion. She has Catholic beliefs, and believes Shibai to be the Messiah and worships her unquestioningly. Teni was raped by her father as a child, but she killed him in self-defense. She spent her early school life being abused, mostly by most of the other children. Teni then learned how to fight, kill, and play the guitar from Shibai, whom she adores. She tried to assassinate Ryomou and retrieve the Gyokuji but Ryomou's dragon woke up and ripped off her right arm, nearly killing her in the process (this was omitted in the anime). Teni is currently in a coma. She possessed a Hyakuhekit≈ç called the 100-Swing Dragon Blade, hidden inside an electric guitar (she does not possess it in the anime). Instead of fighting Kochu in the anime, she fights Choun instead. According to Soujin, Teni was kept apart from the regular Kyosho fighters and took orders directly from Shibai. Because of this, Ten'i is not well-known within the Kyosho ranks and usually only the high-ranking Kyosho fighters (i.e. Sousou, Kakouton, Chukou, Soujin) have any contact with her. By the end of Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny, she fully recovers and is last seen tending to horses with Choryo. :In Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor, she demonstrated a fervent desire to be reunited with Shibai. When Shibai appears to her in the form of the evil Kentei, Teni again pledges her loyalty to her \\"Maria-sama\\". When the fake tournament at Nanban Island is announced, Teni is assigned as the leader of the Nanban warriors whose mission is to subdue and capture the fighters from Kyosho, Nanyou and Seito sent as tournament representatives. Later in the story, she engages in battle with Bachou Mouki as Kentei fights Sonsaku. Despite the enmity, Mouki seems more interested in saving Teni from her misguided loyalty to Kentei and even attempts to save her life when she is in danger of falling from a great height. In the end, Teni falls into the forest below and is apparently lost. After the battle on Nanban Island, a masked stranger wearing a nun's habit is reported to be killing fighters. Mouki tracks down the killer and discovers that it is Teni, now possessed by Kentei's spirit. Kentei then attempts to corrupt Mouki by bringing up the dark, painful memories of her brother's near-fatal injuries along with promises of revenge against Sousou Moutoku. Sousou himself and his comrades approach from behind and put a stop to Kentei's actions. Sousou then picks up Teni's unconscious body and walks away, presumably with the aim of nursing Teni back to health and sanity. :In the video game Ikki Tousen: Eloquent Fist, taking place after the events of Dragon Destiny, Teni became obsessed with finding Shibai after her disappearance, going as great lengths seemingly in vain which caused her to rampage, where as she almost killed Ryomou and Choun when she thought she had sensed Shibai. ; : :One of Shibai's devoted followers, often seen pushing her wheeelchair. He takes over Kaku's place as the strategist, but keeps Kaku in his group (in the anime, he tells Kaku that it is Shibai who is taking over her position as Sousou's strategist, not himself, which prompted Kaku's determination to fight for herself). He was the one who ordered the Ugan gang to attack Hakufu and Teni to attack Ryomou (he does not command the group in the anime, though). When he visited Teni after her fight with Ryomou, he realizes that Shibai does not care for Teni or himself, as she just using them to reach her goal. At the end of Dragon Destiny, he is last seen with Teni, tending to horses. ; : :A member of the , Kyosho Academy's elite trio of A-ranked fighters. His predecessor had skills that equaled Kanu's 1800 years ago. In the original battle, Jokou had forced Kanu to retreat; in the present, Jokou challenged Kanu and even knocked her out. However, Kanu recovered and was able to defeat him. Jokou took a risk and bluffed about how Kyosho's other fighters had Seito surrounded and were about to hunt down Ryuubi. Although at the time Cho-un kept the school and Ryuubi protected, Kanu decided not to risk Ryubi's safety and surrendered. After the Battle of Red Cliffs in Dragon Destiny, the Three Pillared Gods become a tourist attraction in the mountains. ; : :Another member of Kyosho's Three Pillared Gods with the ability to read an individual's magatama by French kissing them. When she read Kanu's mind, she discovered her love for Ryubi. However, she also had a vision of Kanu's predecessor from 1800 years ago. Gakushin broke down and was left stunned when she realized just how powerful Kanu is when she was reawakened. She also uses her kiss to read Koukin's magatama, discovering the whereabouts of one of the Hyakuhekit≈ç. In the anime, the timing of her reading Kanu's mind is different; in the manga, she does it after Jokou knocked Kanu out, but in the anime she does it after Kanu surrenders and is taken prisoner. ; :The last of Kyosho's Three Pillared Gods to be introduced. He uses his staff to touch Kanu's underwear when she is tied. At the Battle of Red Cliff, he is defeated by Koukin. ; : :One of Sousou's fighters sent to the arena. In the manga, he is beaten by Koukin when trying to take his and Hakufu's magatama. ; :The assassin sent to attack Kanu. He is shown to be perverted when he has fun seeing her clothes torn. However, he is defeated. ; and :Kakouon and Junudo are the guardians of Kyosho. They are sent to defend the area where Choun attacks. As in the novel, Kakouon uses the sword . ; :The stalker who follows Bachou in the pilot chapter of volume 1, but is beaten to run by Kansui. He later receives Ryofu's magatama from Kakuka and Kakouton, and possessed a monstrous strength. He defeated Kansui and Houtoku but was later defeated by \\"Kin\\" Bachou. ; :The girl Ryuubi came to the library with after her fight with Kanu. She actually defected to Kyosho and used a sleeping powder to knock Ryuubi unconscious to make it easier for Kyosho fighters to capture her. ; :A fighter who proclaims he is \\"better than Kyocho in a battle\\". He appears while Koukin escapes from Kaku and was about to stop him, but was defeated after just one blow. Seito Academy is a high school named after Chengdu, which based on the Shu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms period. Its leader is Gentoku Ryuubi. ; : :A third-year student at Seito Academy and was an A-Rang fighter however, after the events of the battle against Soso Motoku and the start of the attack of fighters from the Kansai region under the leadership of Himiko Kan'u became even stronger and is a S-Rang fighter now Ikki Tousen manga, vol. 21 thus making her the strongest fighter of Kanto so far. She wears a variation of her school's uniform, where her shirt only extends to her midriff section, and wears baggy socks, which are common aspects of the kogal and ganguro styles among Japanese schoolgirls. Believed to be the most feared and powerful fighter in the Kanto region, she carries the nearly invincible Blue Dragon Crescent Blade from her predecessor as well as the legendary sword Kusanagi, and also has an overwhelming amount of chi. She believes her destiny is to die protecting Ryuubi. It is believed by many characters that Ryomou will one day kill her. She is presumed to be an old friend of Kakouton and Kakuka. Despite this, however, she seems to have taken an interest in Koukin (this happens only in the English manga, where it is not present in the original manga). She is eventually forced to side with Sousou and plan an attack on Nanyo in order to protect Ryubi from Kyosho's fighters, who would certainly be after her. When she surrenders, she is treated as a prisoner; she is handcuffed, beaten, and stripped of her clothing. When Ryubi submits the Gyokuji for Kanu's release, Kanu refuses to accept the offer and stays as a prisoner under her own will. Sousou respects Kanu's wishes and orders the Gyokuji to be returned to Seito. Kanu is able to break free from her handcuffs, clearly holding back while she was captive. She is now treated more fairly while being kept under Sousou's orders. :In the first anime adaptation, Kanu only appears in two episodes to fight with Ryomou and Hakufu (including Hakufu's dragon mode), with Kanu's overconfidence led to her arm being broken by Ryomou. She then got serious and beats off Ryomou using only her legs and left arm, but still won a second fight against Hakufu while she was in her dragon state. Kanu was expected to win the fighter's tournament before she unexpectedly forfeited after her fight against Hakufu. Animation-wise, this Kanu shows both her eyes, which is a totally different hairstyle/look compared to the manga and second season (she is not completely one-eyed in the second season, though; in a few brief scenes both eyes are shown). The blade part of her weapon was never shown in the first season, but is shown from the second season onwards. The Seito school color also appears to be teal instead of blue. :In Dragon Destiny, Kanu is similar to her manga counterpart in terms of appearance. Like her predecessor in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, she is one of the pivotal characters in the events of the series, as she lives her destiny as Ryuubi's protector and as one of the strongest fighters alive. Being the main character in this sequel, Kanu's invincibility was played down to make her character more believable; she was not portrayed as strong as compared to the manga and the first anime series. Kanu is less flirtatious, less confident, insecure, and her intentions towards Ryubi are more obvious. She even admits her love for Ryubi to Koukin. :When she sides with Sousou and with Hakufu looking to challenge Sousou to a fight, Kanu accepts the fight on his behalf. She is seen with a new dark, yet still revealing costume, possibly acting as a metaphor for defecting to Kyosho's evil leader. However, Kanu's loyalty to Ryuubi does not shake, nor does her superiority over other fighters (as Choun pointed out and later proven by Kanu herself when she broke free of her handcuffs under her own power, she could have just left Kyosho if she wanted to). She made it clear to Kakouton that she will kill Sousou if he attempts to assault Seito or harm Ryuubi in any way. She was told to leave Kyosho by Kakouton and she returned to her own school. However she takes Choun's advice to stay away from Ryuubi, allowing Ryuubi to blossom as Seito's leader. She returned at the Battle of Red Cliffs to protect Ryubi. At the end of the series, Kanu is still with Ryuubi, both as her guardian and close friend. A joke at the end has Ryubi recommending Kanu to read a book called Ikki Tousen. The book is meant to be Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which the series is based on. In Great Guardians, she has finally came into terms with her feelings for Ryuubi (who seems unaware), and often fantisizes about Ryuubi doing intimate things with her on numerous occasions. ; : :A klutzy, ditzy, bespectacled bookworm with seemingly no combat skills; she cannot even swim. Ryuubi is destined to be a great leader, but is presently too timid and carefree to become one. However, she is still more than willing to do her best for her friends. She is best friends with Chouhi and possesses the most destructive dragon seen, which is so evil that it radiates enthropic energy and nearly made her disembowel herself before Ryomou, Chouhi, and Kanu stopped her, resulting in all of them being critically wounded. She seems unaware of this and is prone to occasional highly destructive outbursts when her dragon rouses. These outbursts happen when Ryubi sees her friends get hurt in battle. Ukitsu alluded that Ryuubi shares Sonsaku's capacity to anticipate enemy moves. Exclusively in the Tokyopop manga, Ryuubi has a fear of homosexuals, wondering if she is homosexual herself, and convinced that Kanu and Chouhi are lesbians who are attracted to her. :In the anime, the initial difference is that the timing of her first dragon possession is different. The first time she is overwhelmed by her dragon in the manga was three years before the start of the manga. In the anime, it happens during the second series. When Kanu was forced to surrender to Sousou, her determination to rescue Kanu has her slowly gaining control of her dragon's powers. She realized that her school had to go into battle with Nanyo and Kyosho in order to finally end the conflict. Although she was targeted by many fighters in the battle, she was capable of protecting herself. Kanu's return gave Ryubi more encouragement. She was almost strangled to death by Sousou but was saved by the returning Hakufu. Also in the anime, Ryubi's first encounter with Hakufu was much earlier than it was in the manga (where they had yet to meet), and both Ryubi and Hakufu teamed up to destroy Sousou and win the battle for Seito and Nanyo. She is now back to her normal book-reading self. In one episode, she acts as though she will kiss Kanu, but instead runs away from her. ; : :Ryuubi's best friend and an avid snack-lover who is a first-year student at Seito Academy. Although quite weak and only a C-ranked fighter, history states that she will one day become so powerful that legends will tell of her matching ten-thousand men (just like Zhang Fei himself), which makes her well-known around town. She has already performed such a feat, although on a much smaller scale, when Kyosho first assaulted Seito to search for Ryubi. Kakouen almost killed her during their fight, but she was luckily saved by Chouun. After Hakufu manages to defeat Soso's spirit from 1800 years ago and rescued Kyosho's Soso Motoku from his demonic powers Chouhi is seen again sitting together with Ryubi, Komei and Suikyo-sensei and having some small talk right before Yamato School's Yagyu Mitsuyoshi makes her first appearance and other fighters from Kansai start their attack on Kanto to conquer the East of Japan. Yagyu encounters Chou'un but the two end their battle and Chou'un brings Yagyu to Seito where she reveals that Chouhi used to be a student at Yamato School, this implies that Chouhi originally comes from Kansai or at least lived their for some time before she went to Seito. Yagyu further tells that Chouhi constantly tried to become stronger but failed to do so during her whole time at Yamato School. Being confronted with her past failure again her comrades start to tease her, especially Komei uses those little information about Chouhi's past too make fun of her which ends leads to Chouhi kicking Komei out of the scene a few times.Ikki Tousen manga vol. 19 & 20 Due to Yagyu's stay at Seito Hozoin Inshun (another fighter from Kansai, he is S-ranked) attacks Seito and defeats Yagyu with ease, in the same moment Chouhi enters the scene and wants to take revenge for her old friend and takes on Inshun. Yagyu manages to stand up again and teams up with Chouhi against Inshun. In this scene a flashback is shown which tells about that Yagyu often got bullied by other children and Chouhi helped her but both ended up beaten which forged a friendship between the two girls. Back in the present: Chouhi and Yagyu manage to land a huge hit on Inshun which drives him mad and crazy and he easily defeats them two. Ryubi then makes her enter, her dragon is running wild once again but due to Inhsun being S-ranked he has no struggle to tame Ryubi's dragon with ease and defeats her too which leaves Chouhi speechless while she witnessed the power of Inshun. Chouhi starts to cry because Ryubi is wounded badly after the fight with Inshun however, right in this moment Kan'u makes her step and claims victory over Inshun. In this scene it's also stated that Kan'u is also S-ranged currently, she's even called the strongest of all fighters in rank S, which makes her the strongest fighter judged by power. Chouhi's next seen when Kokin visits Seito to discuss the matter of the attacks of the Kansai fighters and suggests that Seito, Nanyo and Koyhso should cooperate to deal with the situation. Despite the seriousness of the moment Chouhi however, displays her usual comical character and doesn't take the matter too seriously at first, claiming Seito would be strong enough on their own thus Komei drops some teasing comments of Chouhi's immature nature. Ryubi and Komei agree to work together with Kokin, Nanyo and even Soso and Kyosho and afterwards Gentoku suggests they all should visit Kofukuji, Nara in order to train there to become strong enough to deal with the Kansai fighters and so the Seito, Nanyo, Kyosho group plus Goei travel to Nara. Chouhi and the others are then seen bathing in a hot spring fooling around, having a party after their arrival. However, things soon get serious again with the attack of Ashiya Doman, who's another S-ranked fighter and first year student of Yamato School. Ashiya is sent to kill the Seito-Nanyo- Kyosho group and attacks them with ninja like speed and strength, Chouhi however, is barely involved in the battle due to being knocked out very early in the confrontation while the others are still fighting against Ashiya. Chouhi is then taken to Shikyo Shonin, a priest at the Nara castle, who offers Chouhi to train her and strengthen her enough to reach Rank S too much to Chouhi's surprise. However, Chouhi agrees without hesitation and Shikyo begins the training with Chouhi to make her reach Rank S which is very brutal and rough for Chouhi.Ikki Tousen manga vol. 24 With this Ikki Tousen ends and Chouhi's training and progress continues in Shin Ikki Tousen. :Her anime incarnation portrays her as a bossy character, and is frustrated that Ryuubi is not the powerful fighter she is meant to be as Seito's leader. Despite that, she is still best friends with Ryuubi and Kanu. She is strong enough to throw Kanu several stories into the air (probably representing Zhang Fei's roar at Changban when the Shu forces were retreating from Cao Cao). At the end of the series, she is seen in a restaurant with Kochu, hinting that the two could be a couple. ; : :A mysterious new girl from Seito High that is presumed to be Seito's \\"secret weapon\\". Easily a super A-ranked fighter, she wields one of the Hyakuhekit≈ç swords with extreme efficiency. In the Ryuubi assassination attempt, she singlehandedly defeated Myosai Kakouen, supposedly one of the more powerful A-ranked characters in the series, literally with her eyes closed while defending Ryuubi from henchmen. She presents herself with her eyes closed most of the time, and is the only girl in Seito that does not wear the standard Seito Academy girls' uniform. She believes that violence is unnecessary and that bloodshed can be avoided to solve conflicts. She has deep respect for Kanu while their strengths rival one another. :Chouun is arguably the most skilled fighter in both the manga and anime series so far (although she herself refers to Kanu as Seito's strongest fighter). Contrary to her looks, she is very laid back. Instead of being sent by Koumei to save Ryuubi from Kakouen's assassination attempt, Chouun was sent by Kanu to defeat Teni and Ryomou's dragon before claiming the Dragon Jade. There is no way to tell her true potential because of her limited fights and her lack of seriousness in them. So far, no fighter has given her a real challenge or even put a tear on her uniform. At the end of the series, she is seen doing a bad attempt at flower arranging. Though it is not clearly pointed out whether she harbors a dragon or not, it is seen in a few flashes, in between her fight scenes, that her eyes are cat-like when open, very similar to those who harbor their dragons with control. This anomaly is also seen in the last episode of the OVA when she plunges a warning sign at the eavesdroppers outside the hot springs. However, in transitions between scenes for Dragon Destiny, she has been drawn revealing a tiger tattoo on her left shoulder blade. :Chouun has a larger role in Great Guardians. At the beach, when Ryuubi was attacked by sharks, she defeated them with one blow. Chouun's eye color is shown as light blue. ; : :A young girl who appears to harbor a dragon (obviously Zhuge Liang himself, who is released after some major feat at the Battle of Red Cliffs) herself. Quiet and enigmatic, it has been suggested that she has been manipulating many great events throughout the series despite being very young. This was stated by Saji, who may have worked for her. She is very attached to Ryuubi, often staying by her side and preventing others from getting in between them. She is destined to be Shibai's arch-nemesis. In preparation for the Battle of Red Cliffs, Koumei has awakened the spirit of the original Zhuge Liang within her. :In Dragon Destiny, she is completely loyal to Ryuubi to the point that she might have a crush on her, and is set on accomplishing Ryuubi's goals no matter what. At one point, she wanted to be the one who takes a bath with Ryuubi. Among other things, she chose the destination for the Battle of Red Cliffs. At the end of the series, she returns to doing her favorite hobby, fishing. She is fascinated by the size of Ryuubi's breasts, which was shown in the first OVA when she compares the breasts of Chouhi, Kanu and Ryuubi in an open-air bath much to their discomfort, and picks Ryuubi's as her favorite because they are the softest. ; : :A monk that worked alongside Genchoku Josho at Tougenin. He first appeared to block Chouhi when she and Ryuubi went to look for Kanu, who was in turn looking for Koumei. He appears to be quite embarrassed by girls, given that he blushes a lot when he sees female flesh or belongings such as panties. He is very strong, however, being able to fight off Teni with ease by being able to block and break her blades with his bare hands as well as take a shot by Hyakuhekit≈ç to the shoulder and still be able to subdue Ryomou when her dragon was unleashed. It is implied that he will kill Kakouen, just like his predecessor did 1,800 years ago. :In the anime, when he put on the Shinro Stone necklace (which reveals a person's true nature), he began hitting on Kanu and Chouhi, which led to him getting beaten up on occasion. However, since he does not fight Teni in the anime, it is unknown how strong he really is. At the end of Dragon Destiny, he is seen in a restaurant with Chouhi, who could now be his sweetheart. ; : :An assassin sent by Koumei to kill Kakuka and frame Kannei of Nanyo for the crime. Although her fighting skills did not match up to Kakuka's, her early preparation of poisoning her blades led to her victory, causing Kakuka to fall into a coma (in the anime, she ends up killing him). She reappears during Seito and Nanyo's assault and was later attacked by a possessed Kannei. In Dragon Destiny, she travels to Nanyo to tell Koukin, Saji and the others that Sousou defeated Hakufu and captured Kanu. Saji was able to recognize her as Kakuka's real killer and knows it was she that framed Kannei for the murder, though he flirts with her anyway. Her main purpose is to bring in reports on Kyosho and Nanyo to Koumei and to defend Seito with Kochu should Sousou ever invade the school. At the end of the series, she joins Koumei for some fishing. ; : :One of the original main characters when the series was being created. She is similar to Hakufu as a ditzy, yet very strong fighter. Instead of having a dragon state, she had the actual spirit of Ma Chao kept in her magatama. When Mouki found her friends seriously hurt in an attack, Ma Chao awakened and temporarily took over her body. She became very powerful and violent, much like Hakufu in her dragon state. :Mouki makes her first anime appearance in Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor. Like her manga counterpart, she is similar to Hafuku as a ditzy, yet very strong fighter. In her first appearance in the anime, she infiltrates Kyosho, searching for Sousou in order to avenge her brother Kansui (who was apparently fatally injured in a fight against Sousou), and easily dodging or knocking down anyone getting her way, including Soujin. She looks up to Hakufu as a mentor and would sometimes train with her when necessary. She is ultimately defeated by Kyocho after the latter explained that Sousou is not around for Mouki to meet. Mouki is seen later walking despondently after failing to complete her objective and after being caught in the rain, she is found by Ryuubi, who calls her \\"Maa-chan\\". She has a strong fear of snakes, though she would temporarily get over her phobia when she aided Hakufu in beheading a snake when they were on Nanban's lower levels. They would escape and she would battle the Kentei-infused Teni three more times, twice at Nanban and one more back at Kanto when she was browsing through town. She would call Koukin \\"a goldfish shit\\" and acted like she hated him while hiding the fact that she had a semi-mild crush on him, but would treat him a bit nicer when they were at Nanban once she figured out what kind of man he really was. After Kentei's disappearance and her avenging Hakufu's seeming death at the hands of Teni's explosion arrow, she would run into Motoku Sousou himself, though she surprisingly listened to every word he said without fail and due to that, she would join Seito. ; / :A B-ranked fighter and a spy for Seito currently posing as Shiyoku Shokan, a Kyosho student. She is an expert at using medical needles. She was one of the three girls who seduced Koukin in an attempt for him to defect to Sousou's side, and she gave him \\"extra attention\\" afterwards to make sure he would not escape. While Koukin was asleep, she sneaked around the school and discovered Junyu with the Hyakuhekitou sword. Junyu caught her spying on him and the two fought. Houto's clothes were cut to shreds and she escaped naked. She reappeared back in bed with Koukin and gave him a message from Koumei, as well as revealing to him what was going on. In the anime, Houto is seen in the last episode of the Dragon Destiny OVA. ; : :Kanu and Chouhi's master. He often tells them about Ryuubi's fate, and is very fond of alcohol. ; : :Seito's advisor. Once Kanu goes to the forest, he challenges her to a fight and defeats her, then takes Kanu back to Shibaki's house. ; and :Tanfuku's disciples who often travel with him in the forest. ; :A student at Seito who was seen in a special chapter of the manga, where she gives Kanu a present and confesses her admiration towards her. Other schools=Yoshu Academy is a high school led by Seirei Ryuyo. It is named after Yangzhou. ; : :A skilled and honorable fighter of African descent, sporting dreadlocks and dressing in hip-hop fashion. He refused to kill Hakufu despite being ordered to do so, and later tried to stop other assassins from finishing his job, but was stabbed in the back as a consequence, putting him in a coma and paralyzing him from the waist down. However, he seems to be recovering from his injuries. He used to be one of Ukitsu's sparring partners, and it is said that Ukitsu always held back when sparring with Shigi because she liked him, though she was still injuring him in these fights (omitted in the anime). While Shiji was kept in the hospital, a girl from Nanyo often visited him and sat by his side. It turns out that the girl was transferring her chi into Shigi for him to recover from his injuries. He wakes up from his coma in time to join the Battle of Red Cliffs, rescuing several injured Nanyo/Seito fighters and defeating Kannei, who was possessed by Ryofu's bloodlust. In the anime, he does not recover from his coma and is presumed to be dead. ; : :Yoshu's leader. ; : :The first fighter Hakufu fights ever. He reappears in the Kanto Battle fighting for Yoshu. He also is not a real fighter, as told by Shigi when Hannou grabbed a metal object to fight Hakufu with. Rakuyo High School is a high school named after Luoyang, a prefecture-level city in the western Henan province of China and a former capital of China during the Three Kingdoms period. Rakuyo was the first of the schools to fall following Toutaku's death. ; : :The leader of Rakuyo High who, until his death, held most of the other schools in a vise grip, possessing both the manpower and the Gyokuji as well as a Hyakuhekit≈ç. In addition, he possesses Dragon of Hao abilities, yet he is not one of them. He is also a masochist, which is seen through his self-mutilation. Exceptionally powerful and arrogant, he attempted to kill off Hakufu in order to change his destiny. He eventually ends up killing Choshou, and is brought to a near-death state by Ryofu directly after the fight with Choshou. He partially changes his fate by committing suicide instead of letting Ryofu kill him. Though the end results are still the same, he at least died with some self-satisfaction. Three years before the start of the manga, he devised a plan which led to Ryubi's dragon awakening for the first time. :In the anime, he has a somewhat more refined mannerism to his sinister nature, and he is far more skilled as well; he demonstrated the power to split a watermelon and a table with his chi into perfect pieces with just a tap from his fingers, and even poisoned Hakufu with his chi. He was also able to possess her and take control of her body. He also seems to dislike watermelons, supposedly because opening them reminds him of the inside of a human's head. His body is destroyed by Ryofu, who uses a double suicide chi blast, at which point he transmigrates into Hakufu, only to be eaten by her dragon later on. It seems as though he had a change of heart on the brink of his death, revealing to Hakufu the truth about Saji being the mastermind behind all this, and that Genpou Saji is not his real identity. He also uses a bit of his remaining strength after being destroyed by Ryofu's double suicide to remove the Fa Jing curse he had previously lain upon her. ; : :A strong fighter with bluish-green hair styled in bunches, Ryofu has had sexual relations with guys and girls, notably Saji and Chinkyuu. In the manga, she has a love-hate relationship with Saji, who she claims once raped her (Saji only half-denies this, claiming that she was not raped because she enjoyed it). She is afflicted with a terminal illness that would kill her before adulthood, she is manipulated by Saji into attacking Toutaku. When she found out that Chinkyuu was raped, she went in search of revenge as her last living act. She was found by Kakouen, and the two fought each other. Kakouen's skill added with Ryofu's failing health was enough for Ryofu to be defeated. She was saved from Kakouen's killing blow by Chinkyuu. Realizing that she was moments away from dying, Ryofu and Chinkyuu then committed a double suicide, dying happily together as their predecessors did 1800 years before. :In the anime adaptation, Ryofu is a capable fighter, but more promiscuous than her manga counterpart, as shown when she molests Ryomou. She also sleeps with multiple guys and Chinkyuu on the girls side. She avenges Chinkyuu's death by trying to fight Hakufu at Toutaku's place, ending up committing murder suicide with Toutaku with a point-blank chi blast.Ikki Tousen episode 12 In Dragon Destiny, her death is recalled differently as she tackles Toutaku off a cliff. At the beginning of Great Guardians, she and Kan'u fight until she is struck by lightning.Ikki Tousen: Great Guardians, episode 1 She is supposedly dead, however, she reappears to Ryomou without any memory of her past.Ikki Tousen: Great Guardians episode 3 she went to Rakuyo in search of clues regarding her past, there being abducted by Ouin and brainwashed by the real Genpou Saji, thus gaining a more cheerful but visibily false persona. From there on, she played with Ouin so as to fill Ryomou with jealousy until Saji herself was discovered, when she was turned into a frenzied berserk as a mean of halting Hakufu and her companions. The last episodes also reveal that, in fact, this Ryofu is actually much like a living dead, a spirit partially resurrected by Saji that, after regaining her senses, fades again from this world, bidding farewell to Ryomou. Still, one last line from her can be heard when Saji is praying at her tomb (\\"Thank you\\"). ; : :Ryofu's childhood friend and lesbian lover, and a C-rank fighter with great potential. While Ryofu was battling Totaku, Chinkyuu knocked out Kaku to prevent her from interfering. Kaku got her revenge when she caught Chinkyuu stealing the Gyokuji and got Chizen Rikaku to rape her. When Chinkyuu recovered from her injuries, she saves Ryofu from being killed by Myosai. However, she realizes that Ryofu is moments away from dying due to her illness. Since she was loyal and in love with Ryofu, Chinkyuu decides to stay by her friend's side and commits suicide with her instead of surrendering to Sousou. In the anime, she dies in the hospital from injuries inflicted when she was raped. She also tried to steal the Gyokuji on her own accord, rather than being ordered to do so by Ryofu, and wanted to present it to Ryofu as a gift before she died. ; : :A bespectacled, long raven-haired beauty who was once Totaku's second-in-command. Intelligent, seductive, and manipulative, her power lay in manipulating others into doing her dirty work as she is otherwise an average fighter. She helped set up the events that led to Ryubi's dragon being awakened three years before the start of the series, and offered to help Enjutsu get the respect he should have had as Nanyo's leader at the time. Knowing Teifu's feelings for Ryomou, Kaku disguised herself as Ryomou and faked a video in which she was about to be raped by Enjutsu's henchmen. Teifu fell for it and was forced into attacking Seito and look for Ryubi in order to protect Ryomou. In reality, the entire plan was devised by Totaku in order to see how powerful Ryubi's dragon was. After Totaku's death, Kaku switches sides and joins Sousou at Kyosho Academy, who accepted her with open arms. She became (or always has been) Kakuka's lover, plotting to take advantage of Sousou's power. She was genuinely in love with him until he was taken out of action. However, she gets into a sexual relationship with whomever she plots with (Totaku, Kakuka and now currently Junyu). She is aware of Koukin's crush on Hakufu (although it is possible that everyone in the series knows it), and also teased him by taking off her underwear in front of him before three other Kyosho girls seduced him in an attempt to make him defect from Nanyo. She suspected Koukin's plan of bodily harm, but failed to plan accordingly. :Kaku's anime counterpart is portrayed as more submissive than her manga counterpart, but is also more trusting and trustworthy. She is less seductive and does not act as calculating or as cunning. Towards the end of the first season, she switches from Rakuyo Academy to Kyosho Academy.Ikki Tousen season 1 episode 11 In fact, she seems almost caring towards Sousou and his friends, leading them to trust her more, or at least be less suspicious of her. As the strategist Chuutatsu Shibai continues to gain power within Kyosho Academy, Kaku gradually finds herself being kept out of the loop. During this time, some of the more ruthless low-level Kyosho fighters begin to openly mock her. Hearing about the Dragon Jade, she feels that this would be what she needed in order to get back in Sousou's good graces. After informing Kakouen about Kakuka's murder, Kaku orders the assassin to recover the artifact. She could have been working for her own needs after she was told by Sousou that she was no longer necessary for his plans. She was the only Kyosho officer not invited to the Battle of Red Cliffs. She does not appear again for the rest of the series until the end, where she meets an amnesiac Kakouton. :Her henchmen in Rakuyou include Chizen Rikaku (ÊùéÂÇï Á®öÁÑ∂), Kayuu (ËèØÈõÑ) and Kousei (‰æØÊàê), the Japanese equivalents of Li Jue, Hua Xiong and Hou Cheng respectively. That Kousei betrayed Ryofu and attacked her with his group in Chinkyuu's hospital was based on that Hou Cheng (with two other generals) betrayed L√º Bu for Cao Cao. Gogun High School is a high school named after Wu Commandery, roughly modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), which is led by Ukitsu. ; : :A dark-skinned girl and the leader of Gogun High who is destined by her magmatama to kill Hakufu, as her predecessor did 1800 years ago. She wears extremely heavy body weights on her wrists and ankles, and is an amazing fighter who has mastered nearly every type of martial arts in existence, using them instinctively and masterfully with nearly no chi whatsoever. She is also tomboyish, as she tends to use \\"boku\\" (the male equivalent of \\"I\\") when referring to herself. She is nicknamed \\"Genius Ukitsu\\" because of her talents and knowledge of martial arts. Since she does not use her chi to fight, Hakufu had a major disadvantage against her; she was unable to predict Ukitsu's moves by reading her chi. Ukitsu's views on fighting are similar to those of Hakufu. She loves to fight and is motivated by taking on stronger opponents (which rarely happened before facing Hakufu). Hakufu's Dragon state easily overpowered Ukitsu and nearly killed her until she was unexpectedly saved by Koukin. Ukitsu became depressed while she was recovering from the fight and has kept a low profile lately. She had a vision of Hakufu's dragon flying through the skies towards Nanyo, which should inspire her to return to action. :Ukitsu plays a more important role in the anime adaptation. She first appears saving Hakufu from two perverted men in a karaoke bar (Hakufu was oblivious to their intentions), and is continually seen watching over Hakufu, as her master Chokou intends to help Hakufu harness her dragon. Ukitsu willingly follows Chokou's orders and challenges Hakufu to a fight several times, but each time Hakufu passes out for some other reason. They finally fight at the end where, unlike the manga, Hakufu manages to tame her Dragon before she can injure Ukitsu. The two become friends and agree to fight again, this time as friends and not as fighters, and seal their bond by removing their magatama. :Ukitsu also appears in Dragon Destiny, this time trying to fully revive Hakufu, where it is revealed that she is also friends with Hakugen. According to Chokou, Ukitsu is the only person who is able to revive Hakufu because it is her destiny to kill her. Since Ukitsu is the one who's fate is to kill Hakufu, then theoretically she can also save her. Chokou also mentioned that her defeat at the hands of Hakufu in the past affected her greatly, an event that was interpreted differently in the first season. So it is possible that the first season's ending is not considered to be canon. This would explain why Ukitsu and her school never helped Hakufu and Nanyo in the war despite the fact that the two schools formed an alliance at the end of the first season. Ukitsu was successful in reawakening Hakufu but died shortly afterwards, sacrificing her life to save Hakufu's. She was buried near a waterfall where she trained. ; :A fighter sent by Ukitsu to fight Hakufu. He uses Muramasa, the Sword of Calamity, as his weapon. He is defeated by Hakufu after his arms and legs were strained. ; :A B-ranked fighter sent to receive Hakufu at the gate. He is easily defeated by her. ; :The Vice President of Gogun Academy's Student Council. He meets Hakufu at the entrance of Gogun and tells her to pull back, but was quickly defeated in a similar fashion as Hikei was. ; :A B-ranked fighter who bears a close resemblance to Bruce Lee. He fights Hakufu when she goes to find Ukitsu for the first time, but is quickly defeated along with Chokei. Yoshu Private School is a school named after Yuzhou City, a city located in the central Henan privince in China. ; :A student at Yoshu Private School. He does not make his full appearance in the manga, as he only sent Koshaji to kill Sousou and Kakouton. In the anime adaptation, after Koshaji died, Yoshu is immediately attacked by the Three Pillared Gods of Kyosho led by Kaku. After the deaths of Ganryo and Bunshu, Honsho surrenders to Sousou, but was killed when Sousou orders Kaku to kill everyone to avenge Kakouton's lost eye. ; : :An assassin sent to kill Sousou while he was injured from a gang battle. She blinded Kakouton's left eye with a hidden needle attack, which caused Sousou to unleash his Dragon and kill Koshaji for revenge, although we do not see him kill her. In the anime, after Sousou defeats Koshaji, he grabs her by the head and smashes her face-first into a wall, killing her instantly. ; : :An aggressive fighter who even attacks Kouran, his schoolmate, to get the chance to fight for his school. He was defeated by Ryomou. ; : :A powerful fighter who battled Teifu. He almost killed him until Ryomou attacked him to protect Teifu. ; :The advance guard of Yoshu Academy. She is arranged to the only fighter of Yoshu in the battle against Nanyo, but Ganryo beats her up to fight in her place. ; :The strategist of Yoshu. He arranges only Kouran to fight Nanyo because he thinks there is no fair fight using five A-ranked fighters to fight two B-ranks. Other schools=Ryoshu Academy is a high school named after Liangzhou, a district located in Gansu that is part of the Wuwei prefecture in China. The students of Ryoshu were the original main characters when the manga was first being planned. Although the original and final manga designs have similarities, there were some differences in the story. An example is that it was only the magatamas that originally had the spirits of past warriors and the characters were not modern-day equivalents of important warriors from 1800 years ago, so it was likely that character's destinies would not be featured in the storyline. A few other characters, like Kakouton and Kakuka, appeared, with Kakouton having a much different personality, while Ryofu's magatama was used to turn a fighter named Ritsu Buntatsu into a violent maniac. The pilot chapter is included in volume 1 of the Ikki Tousen manga. ; : :One of the original main characters when the series was being created. She is similar to Hakufu as a ditzy, yet very strong fighter. Instead of having a dragon state, she had the actual spirit of Ma Chao kept in her magatama. When Mouki found her friends seriously hurt in an attack, Ma Chao awakened and temporarily took over her body. She became very powerful and violent, much like Hakufu in her dragon state. ; : :One of the original main characters when the series was being created. He is friends with and also a protector of Mouki. He and Teigin fight together against Ritsu, who possessed Ryofu's magatama, but lost. In the current storyline, he is seen in volume 3 fighting for his school. :In the anime, he makes a brief cameo in the first season, but makes a full appearance an episode of Xtreme Xecutor during one of Mouki's flashbacks, at which he was portrayed as her older brother. He looks exactly the same as he was in the manga, aside from being a little older. Throughout the past, he has always protected his sister from any trouble. He no longer protects Mouki after he was apparently fatally injured in a fight against Sousou, causing his sister to start to search for Sousou to avenge his death. But to him, he does not want her to take revenge of his fallen action (death), and wants her to start something new in her life. He had taught Mouki that the courage of believing herself is the key of being the bravest. At the end, she remembers what he had said to her. He wishes that he saying will help for Mouki (sister) in her future. ; :One of the original main characters when the series was being created. She, along with Kansui, is a protector of Mouki. She and Kansui fight together against Ritsu, who possessed Ryofu's magatama, but lost later. ; Nanban High School is a high school named after Nanman tribe, which is led by Moukaku and Mouyu. Briefly appearing in the first anime adaptation, in which Kanu defeated them in the tournament hosted by Rakuyo High School, they appear again in Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor.. ; : :One of the leaders of Nanban High. Prior to the start of the series, she, along with her sister Mouyu, attempted to conquer the entire Kanto region. However they were stopped due to the emergence of the Nanyo, Seito and Kyosho leaders. At the start of Xtreme Xecutor, she forms an alliance with Kentei. Moukaku wears a very revealing outfit, consisting of yellow shorts, a sleeveless yellow jacket exposing her bra, a yellow peak hat and yellow boots. Personality-wise, Moukaku is very condescending, adding the word at the end of her sentences. She fights using a modified Chinese ring, which she uses for hand-to-hand combat as well as a throwing weapon. She, along with Mouyu, would experience a change of heart, and decided to re-evaluate how they viewed life and competition before leaving the series completely. ; : :The second leader of Nanban High and the level-headed and honorable one of the duo. She went to great lengths to try to kill Gentoku Ryubi, in which she had her meeting with a nude Choun who matched Mouyu's strength and force her to retreat. Mouyu later returns to fight Choun again and was trumped by her sheer power, and opted to take her own life only to be saved by Ryubi's fluctuating power which forced her to change her perspective of ruling Kanto. She would eventually shift sides and aid Seito in the destruction of Kentei's lair (within Nanban) and causing Kentei's full-fledged revival to cease. ; : :A beastman that was conned by Kentei into accepting a power that would effectively strip him of any humanity that he once had. He appears within Seito's wooded lands to trap and capture Gentoku Ryubi, but is stopped by Mouyu who was then viciously beaten by him. He then tried to force his will on Ryubi and Koumei, who were saved by Gakushu and Hakufu, and was swiftly defeated by them. He, however, would accept even more power from Kentei, buffing him considerably and proving to be a match for everyone until he inadvertedly triggered Ryubi's dragon, which shredded him into ribbons while turning her into a semi-comatose dragon. Video game characters ; : :A video game-only character who first appears in the PS2 game Ikki Tousen: Shining Dragon, and is allied with Rakuyo High School. Compared to her Three Kingdoms counterpart, Chousen is much more aggressive and brash, and carries a sword as her main weapon. She does not have the same romantic feelings for Ryofu (as the Original Diao Chan did for Lu Bu), but is still on friendly terms with her. Also, Chousen desired to awaken her own Dragon Potent to crush Hakufu and Ryubi (which explains why she shapeshifted into various Nanyo and Seito representatives, which varies among whom's storyline one plays as). :A few months later after suffering a humiliating defeat (presumably to Kanu) in Shining Dragon, Chousen returns in the PlayStation Portable game Ikki Tousen: Eloquent Fist, scathing from her last loss and hell-bent on vengeance, but loses her motivation after Kanpei snaps and mows her down with relative ease which sets up her being manipulated by Kyosho (namely Shibai this time) for a second time, but snaps back to normal after being trumped by her close friend, Ryofu. Chousen does have a Dragon ability (albeit a Light-type based Dragon), and either refuses to use it under her own volition or simply does not know how to. Also, Chousen has been relegated to that of a minor bad guy who seemingly seeks revenge for her plans being halted, and sided with Kyosho to seek revenge on Nanyo/Seito when in reality, she was only siding with Kyosho just to stop Sousou from integrating Kanpei into himself. However, it seems that after being defeated by Kanu, she is broken free of a mind control (presumably Sousou's as he comes out to chide Chousen directly after she loses). Like Kanpei's crush on Kanu in Eloquent Fist, Ekitoku has a not-so-intimate girl-crush on Chousen, even going as far as to call her \\"big sister\\" in the scene before she fights her Dragon state. ; : :The heroine of Ikki Tousen: Eloquent Fist. She is seemingly a member of Seito (wearing the Seito colors), but, like Chousen (who wore Rakuyo colors), she, too, does not have a legitimate school home, and is only interested in the Dragon Potent (though her true desire is towards saving Kanu, which implies that she does have a girl crush on Kanu). She, too, harbors a dragon, which was seen at the end of Chapter One with her going berserk after either Kanu or Hakufu defeat Sousou. Come to find out that Kanpei was possessed by her dragon during those times where she was the enemy intruder, as noted by the end of the Seito chapter where she returns and becomes a legitimate member of Seito (albeit just to bring her closer to the woman she's vowed to protect). :In a mission-mode based storyline, Kanpei winds up running into Chousen, who demands that she fight her, in which Chousen would have won except for the fact that Kanpei (like Ryubi) has absolutely no control over her dragon, thus snapping and easily defeating a weakened Chousen. After this, she vowed to defeat all the people who stand in between her and her precious Kanu, which brought her to Ryubi, whom she is jealous of because Kanu has admiration (and legitimate feelings for) and that Kanpei rarely got noticed by Kanu until she'd snap. After Kanpei defeated Ryubi, her dragon seemingly woke up and not only defeated Kanpei, but trashed the Koumei dojo as well. Only when Kanu sacrificed her well-being for Ryubi did Kanpei realize the fate of the two and their relationship. Though Kanpei left dejected because Kanu wanted to be with Ryubi, she did leave with the satisfaction that Kanu was protected by someone with such a strong resolve and thus drops out of sight. :In the Nanyo Arc, Kanpei was merely playing the role of the bad guy to attest the Sho Ha≈ç (Hakufu's) true ability and see if she was in fact good enough to face Sousou. After Hakufu won her battle, Kanpei seemingly leaves the Kanto region for a long period of time, attesting that all three schools had amazing potential. After the events of Eloquent Fist, she joins with Chousen in China to train and enjoy the hot springs there. She returns as a playable character in Xross Impact. ; : :Game-exclusive character :The childhood friend of Ryubi Gentoku and the destined \\"hero\\" of Kanto, or so she believes. Appearing exclusively in Ikki Tousen: Xross Impact, she is first introduced when a bunch of Nanyo students spot her on top of Nanyo making her bold proclamation that the Battle Range Hunting (\\"the Second Great Tournament\\") has commenced and the fate of the region will be determined. Seemingly stupid and childish, Ato would prove that she is actually quite intelligent, and was merely playing a role so that no one would take her seriously, which worked so incredibly well she even fooled Shibai Chuutatsu, who is one of the great revered strategists, along with Ryofu Housen and her follower, Chinkyu Koudai. :During the Nanyo arc, she even manages to convince Ryubi to help her stop the advancing Nanyo fighters from taking over the Seito Theatre (when in reality, Nanyo had no intentions of taking over the Theatre, they were unknowingly going to dispel Shibai's forces there). While Ato and Ryubi lost horribly to Hakufu and Ryomou, Ato learned, just like Kanpei before her, that Nanyo (and more specifically, Hakufu herself) is a true ally to Seito's cause. Her fighting style reflects her spiritual abilities, having her cape being able to transform into a variety of things, such as a priestess- styled kimono, a swimsuit (as evident in one of her super arts), and also the cape can be used to protect herself from potential damage. :During the Seito arc, Ato desired to commence the Battle Range Hunting to become a hero and \\"save the day\\". When in reality she was possessed by Demon Shibai just like Ryofu and Chinkyu was until they broke free after Chousen joins the opposing army [either teaming with Kanu or Hakufu]. She also had called out Kanu to see if she was worthy of being with her friend Ryubi but after losing horribly and having to ask for Kanu's forgiveness, she tones down a bit while maintaining her \\"rivalry\\" with Kanu and becoming a member of Seito as well. Other characters ; : :Hakufu's widowed, extremely promiscuous and flirtatious mother. She is a strong fighter and a loving, yet strict mother who is not above getting drunk at parties with her daughter or pummeling her into the floorboards. She unexpectedly moves in with Koukin and Hakufu. While she teases Koukin for his crush on her daughter, she is against the idea of Koukin and Hakufu being in a romantic relationship. She accepts Hakufu's fate and shows no resistance whenever her daughter faces her apparent doom. However, when she found out that Kakouton protected Hakufu from the Ugan gang, she becomes more optimistic about everyone's attempts to change their fates. In the manga she is quite seducing especially when she is under influence of alcohol, in one chapter this even made her flirt with Saji Genpo/Oin Shishi which he surprisingly took as a compliment while the rest of the characters reacted with disgust about this moment. Despite her strong love for her dead husband Sonken Bundai it's a running gag in the series (both in manga and anime) that she often fantasizes about other men and what she could do with them in a sexually manner. Goei is also somewhat perverted which was displayed in one bonus chapter in manga vol 9 where she was asked by Kokin about her favorite bath additives to which she replies with 'men's juice' much to Kokin's disgust.Ikki Tousen manga vol. 9 :In the anime, she is depicted as a much stronger fighter, and punishes Hakufu on a regular basis, especially when Hakufu calls her an old hag. These punishments are usually spankings, but can sometimes be something more violent (in one scene, she throws Hakufu through a door). Despite being an inactive fighter, she is still very skillful, as she was able to defeat Tototsu and his Ugan gang after they attack Koukin and Hakufu outside their home. She is attracted to Kakouton, and flirts with him whenever they meet, leading Kakouton's friends to think they are in a relationship. Also, she seems to approve of Koukin's crush on Hakufu more; in the first series, she once took Koukin's pillow, then puts it in Hakufu's bed and encourages him to sleep next to Hakufu, much to his embarrassment. ; :Goei's deceased husband and Hakufu's father. He originally had possession of Hakufu's magatama. In the anime, while Hakufu was unconscious after her defeat by Sousou, she met up with her father in a vision. Sonken appeared dressed as a warrior leading an army, and encouraged Hakufu to reach her destiny. ; : :An old man who trained Hakufu when she was a child. He is an old friend of Goei, and he possibly trained her too, and has also trained Ukitsu and Rikuson. He explains to Goei about Hakufu's fate to be killed by Ukitsu. When Ukitsu was recovering from her fight with Hakufu, Chokou mentions that her loss to Hakufu was a necessary sacrifice needed to awaken Hakufu's dragon. He is currently trying to teach the Water Dragon Fist to Hakufu with the help of Rikuson and Saji. :In the anime, he is referred by Hakufu as \\"Grandfather\\" (it may just be a title, as elderly family friends are called grandfathers in Japan), and he helps train Hakufu and Ryomou at his hot springs. He is also shown to be slightly perverse, as seen during one sparring session when he purposely knocked both Hakufu and Ryomou into a lake just to see them wet. In Dragon Destiny, he is the one who performs a revival on Hakufu's body where he only manages to awaken her dragon, but was able to keep her dragon under control. He tells Ukitsu that only she is able to revive Hakufu's spirit. We find out that he also trained Hakugen. At the end of the series, he and Hakugen are seen attending Ukitsu's grave, and he gives thanks to Ukitsu for sacrificing her life in order to save Hakufu, thus changing the fates of many fighters for the better. ; : :An old woman with the appearance of a young girl, Choshou is in charge of the Hyakukeit≈ç, a set of 5 legendary Chinese jian made of jewels supposedly made by Cao Cao in ancient China. All five were embedded in a large boulder on Chosho's property and sealed with chi, making them impossible to remove. Totaku was the first person to train under her to obtain the Hyakuhekitou, then Kanu, Ryomou, and Hakufu, with Hakufu the last one to seek training from her. Totaku went berserk in a blind sight of rage after Chosho lectured him about being weak. Hakufu tried to save her but fell unconscious after a jumping from a cliff turning to get to the city faster. Chosho gave Hakufu a gift through a kiss. It is possible that she is dead after giving Hakufu her gift, and it is not yet said what her gift was. Chosho appeared in episode 8 of Great Guardians, where she is seen training Ryomou. ; : :The talented doctor living near Hakufu's place. He takes care of her many times when she gets injured after battles. He is also responsible for making the talisman-enchanted eyepatches for sealing in Ryomou's dragon. ; :A fighter from , a school named after the Wuhuan, a nomadic people that once inhabited northern China. He was ordered by Sousou to attack Hakufu while she was resting, but was defeated when the others come to help her. ; : :Anime- exclusive character :A character who appears exclusively in Ikki Tousen: Great Guardians (and so far is an anime-exclusive character like Chubou), and is the main antagonist of the series. She is first introduced as a mysterious cloaked girl (Red Hood in the English version) with a crystal ball who would often show up and speak to Ryomou, and true identity was not revealed until several episodes later. She is a fighter with a tragic past. As a child, she was shunned by others out of fear or disgust because of her unique powers. She was also frequently bullied and harassed for being different with only one girl (most likely Chubo based on her voice) who ever tried to stand up for her, but to no avail. She is capable of using genjutsu, as shown by her revival of Ryofu, and has shown mind-controlling abilities (she controls some of the stronger fighters in the series, most noticeably Ryofu, Ryubi and her friends [excluding Kanu], and even Hakufu herself). However, prolonged use of mind control causes her to suffer great pain. She hates all forms of love and friendship, and goes to great lengths with her powers to break them up, wanting everyone to suffer as she had in the past, believing that obtaining Ryomou's dragon will give her the power to do so. She has a crush on Ouin (the \\"fake\\" Saji), believing him to be the only one who understands her. ; : :The main antagonist of Ikki Tousen: Xtreme Xecutor. He appeared one day to the leaders of Nanban High and offered his aid in conquering the Kanto area in exchange for swearing allegiance to him. It was Kentei's plan to divide and conquer the Kanto superpowers (Nanyo, Seito, and Kyosho) by luring their most powerful warriors to a fake tournament on Nanban Island while sending assassins to murder the leaders while their defenses were down. He also planned to resurrect thousands of vengeful dead warriors using the blood spilled by the fighters in his captivity. To do this, he manipulated the fighters by focusing on their darkest, most evil emotions. For example, Kentei brought forth within Kanu the raging hatred and need for vengeance the historical Guan Yu felt for L√º Meng in his last moments of life. :Given Kentei's strong ties to the spirits of the deceased, it is likely that Kentei is an undead amalgam of several deceased, yet strong-willed, individuals, including Shibai and the historical Xian Di. Driven purely by ambition, hatred, and vengeance, Kentei will not stop until the entire world falls into anarchy and chaos. Although he would never admit it, Kentei is particularly afraid of those who can conquer destiny, especially Hakufu. :Kentei makes his first appearance outside the anime in volume 18 of the manga (albeit taking the form of a young mature girl). Unlike his anime counterpart, the female Kentei is the other force that is vying to change the fate of the fighters (the other being Shibai who is trying to destroy the world, while Kentei is trying to save it). She appears during Hakufu's fight with the past Sousou, and saved her from a deathblow where she tells her how to save the present Sousou and defeat his past counterpart. Hakufu affectionately refers to her as Ken-chan. She is also the one to reveal that Shibai is not her real name and that her real name is Gifu who happened to be a minor figure in Ancient China, which could explain Shibai's hatred of fighters and why she was luring the Fate dragon into her body. However, Gifu's plot would be stopped when Teni stabbed both herself and Gifu. ; : :A third-year student of Daiwa Institute, who came to Kanto alongside other Western warriors to challenge the Fighters. She's also and old acquaintance of Ekitoku, since they went to the same middle school. :She first appears in the Extravaganza Epoch OVA, challenging Chou'un to a sword fight with the intention of taking her Magatama. Confident in her skills, she even wears an eyepatch to give her opponent a leverage. At the end of the fight, when her opponent slices her eyepatch, she realizes that Chou'un was not fighting with her own sword, making her come to respect Shinryu, postponing the duel. Before she can leave, Mitsuyoshi notices that she forgot her wallet, and ends up asking Chou'un for money. She's invited by Chou'un to Seito and reveals that Himiko sent them to take as many Magatamas as possible, but unaware of her endgame. She ends up fighting alongside Ekitoku against Inshun to pay an old favor, only to be poisoned by the monk. ; : :A very powerful monk who was sent to collect as many Magatamas as possible, branding his defeated opponents with the seal of his clan. He targets Seito and fights Ekitoku and Mitsuyoshi, defeating both of them using a poisonous technique to immobilize them. Even Gentoku's Dragon was useless to defeat him, but before he could brand her, he was stopped by Kan'u. Despite being injured, he eventually overpowered his enemy. :Born with his current S-Rank, Gentoku showed him his memories and how because he was always told he was powerful and different, he became alienated from his peers, eventually becoming ruthless, depraved and obsessed with power. When Kan'u recovered her strength and ascended to S-rank, she confronted him on how deep down, he simply wanted companions. Despite being overpowered and with his weapon broken, Inshun refused to give up, until he was brought down by Unchou. ; : :A second year student of Yamashiro Academy who debuts in the anime during Extravaganza Epoch OVA, sent to attack Kyosho alongside Yoshitsune under orders from Himiko. She fights Chuukou until she cannot move anymore, but before she can finish her, she realizes that all the other students are willing to put their lives on the line to protect Sousou, expressing envy towards their bonds. ; : :Another student of Yamashiro Academy who debuts in the anime during the Extravaganza Epoch OVA, who attacks Sousou while Benkei distracts the other students. She uses a very long katana and slices Sousou's eyes before he can react. She keeps taunting her opponent until Sousou learns to read her movements, defeating her despite being blinded. She's picked up by Benkei, but ended achieving her objective, stealing Sousou's Magatama. ; : :The mysterious leader of Yamashiro academy, who came to the east alongside several other warriors in order to gather as many Magatamas as possible for an unknown purpose. She sent several fighters to attack Hakufu and when she was distracted, she knocked her out with a kiss and took her Magatama. At the end of the OVA she was seen with Yoshitsune and Benkei atop a building, with Sousou and Hakufu's Magatamas in her hands.

Built in the late 1940s the old kiosk has been replaced by a new futuristic structure.  History  In May 1940 Commander Coakley took his two Thames 'little ships' to rescue men stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk. One little ship was lost and the other badly damaged. To enable Commander Coakley to earn a living after the war the Port of London Authority (PLA) rented him a small piece of land on the Victoria Embankment. It was here that Coakley erected a kiosk from which to sell tickets for riverboats. In 1960 Coakley wished to retire and contacted one of his relatives, Kate Stanton, to enquire if she would be willing to run the kiosk for him. Kate ran it with her other business interests for a year or two, and increased sales substantially. In 1964 Kate's daughter, Julia Stanton, took over the running of Cleopatra's Kiosk and has been there ever since. In 1998 it was reported that the kiosk had not been closed since shortly after the Second World War apart from Christmas Days. To help construction of the Golden Jubilee pedestrian Bridge (Hungerford Bridge) Westminster City Council at first proposed that the kiosk should be removed and issued a compulsory purchase order but later agreed that the kiosk would be moved to a nearby temporary location to allow the business to continue whilst the footbridge construction works were in progress. Owing to the move, the fabric of the kiosk deteriorated.  Architectural competition  It was agreed by Westminster City Council that the area between the base of the brick railway pier and the steps leading from Embankment pier through the listed river wall will be leased to Samuel Alexander Ltd (the owners of the kiosk). A new structure was planned to be designed and constructed on this site. Following an international architectural design competition held in 2003 by RIBA Competitions, in which over 200 of the world's leading architects competed, the old kiosk was replaced by a new highly modernistic one designed by the Italian firm Bianchini e Lusiardi associati with the work projected to take up to five years. It was actually completed in July 2007 with the cost of the project amounting to ¬£160,000. The site is located to the north west of the Golden Jubilee Bridge on the Victoria Embankment opposite the Embankment Tube Station.

Reflex anoxic seizures are not epileptic seizures or epilepsy. This is usually a consequence of a reduction in cerebral perfusion by oxygenated blood. It can be a result of either a sudden reduction in the blood flow to the brain, a drop in the oxygen content of the blood supplying the brain, or a combination of the two. Syncope can have different meanings ranging from transient loss of consciousness, usually accompanied by a decrease or loss in postural tone (the principal manifestations of ‚Äúsimple faints‚Äù), to tonic and myoclonic events and nonepileptic spasms. Signs and symptoms A minor bump to the head is the most commonly reported precipitant. Usually the toddler trips and falls; the child's caregiver may hear the bump. Most commonly, the child does not cry, although some parents give descriptions of the child ‚Äútrying to cry‚Äù (Stephenson 1978), or there may be a gasp or a sob. Syncope rapidly ensues. Indeed the short latency between the stimulus and the attack has been emphasized as an important distinction from the more familiar (at least in older children and adults) vasovagal syncope. The child loses awareness and postural tone, falling to the ground. There may be down- beat nystagmus. The child is likely to be pale, sometimes described as ‚Äúdeathly white,‚Äù which is entirely appropriate given that they are likely to be asystolic; however, it is important to note that not all children go pale (or at least are perceived as going pale by their caregivers). Doctors have recorded descriptions from parents of ‚Äúblue or purple lips,‚Äù ‚Äúyellow patches through the blue,‚Äù and of no noticeable color change. In some attacks, the child rapidly returns to normal following the limp or pallid phase. However, more usually there is a convulsive phase. This is usually manifested with tonic stiffening, often amounting to opisthotonus, and often includes clenching of the jaw and hands. Video recordings of other forms of anoxic seizures (vasovagal syncopes) suggest that there may be marked asymmetry. Parents may report the eyes to have rolled or to be ‚Äúpopping out of the head.‚Äù A few clonic jerks of the limbs or spasms are often noted. Urinary incontinence is not uncommon. Any initial limpness may be so short that the whole attack is dominated by the convulsive components. Recovery Recovery is often rapid, but usually the child is sleepy after the attack, and there may be persisting pallor. Doctors reported that the length of the postictal stupor reflected the duration of the asystole up to a maximum of 3 minutes of stupor. Some cases recorded took longer to recover. Cause Reflex anoxic seizures are a particular type of anoxic seizure, most commonly seen in young children in whom an anoxic seizure or syncope is provoked or precipitated by a noxious stimulus (hence ‚Äúreflex‚Äù). Various precipitants have been identified, but the most common is an unexpected bump to the head. Breath-holding attacks have been recognized for centuries. However, it is only relatively recently that their pathophysiology has begun to be understood, and in consequence, their separation from reflex anoxic seizures has been recognized. Indeed, the distinction between the two may not be complete. Although minor bumps to the head are reported as the most common precipitants to reflex anoxic seizures, many other stimuli may also be involved. Doctors emphasized the importance of minor injuries and sudden fright. They noted that occipital blows to the head appeared to be particularly provocative. Pain, especially from emotion (surprise, fear, annoyance, frustration, and excitement), crying, and fever were provocative factors. Fever was reported as a provocative factor in 14% of cases. Some cases of fever-induced reflex anoxic seizures are likely to be misdiagnosed as febrile (epileptic) seizures, as has been emphasized by a number of authors. Many, if not most, cases of venipuncture fits are reflex anoxic seizures. When one considers the vast range of situations in which a child (or adult) can be surprised, frightened, upset, or merely excited, it is easy to understand how reflex anoxic seizures can occur in special settings, such as bathing and water immersion; in the anesthetic room; when witnessing ‚Äúblood and gore‚Äù; at the dentist office, school, place of worship, or the hairdresser's; and whilst watching television. The precipitants and the manifestations of reflex anoxic seizures may change with age. Hence, in unsteady toddlers, minor bumps to the head are likely to predominate, whilst in the older child, adolescent and adult factors such as the sight of blood or venipuncture are likely to be more relevant. The adult physician is likely to classify such events as vasovagal syncopes rather than as reflex anoxic seizures and indeed progression through reflex anoxic seizures to vasovagal syncope is recognized. In this regard, note that beyond the toddler stage, children with reflex anoxic seizures may report out-of-body experiences with a dream-like quality.http://www.medlink.com/medlinkcontent.asp Types Numerous types have been described. The best known, if not necessarily the best understood, is the ‚Äúsimple faint‚Äù or vasovagal syncope. At least in infants and children, breath-holding attacks are also widely recognized as reflex anoxic seizures. Other types include cardiac syncope (including long QT disorders, other cardiac arrhythmias, and structural cardiac disease), syncope due to standing (see orthostatic hypotension), hyperventilation, compulsive Valsalva maneuvers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and imposed upper airway obstruction(suffocation). In addition, anoxic seizures are a feature of both hyperekplexia and familial rectal pain syndrome. Finally, there are likely to be other types of anoxic seizure or syncope not yet characterized. Epidemiology There is considerable variation in the frequency of reflex anoxic seizures. Some subjects undoubtedly only ever have a single attack whilst other well-documented cases have multiple daily attacks. The attacks have been reported to generally reach a peak in frequency towards the end of the first or beginning of the second year of life. Reflex anoxic seizures occur in otherwise normal children, although there is no reason to suppose that children with disorders such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation are protected from them. They usually start in infancy or early childhood. Presumably because the precipitants to the attacks generally require a degree of mobility, descriptions of reflex anoxic seizures before the age of 6 months are rare. Also, there are many descriptions of attacks starting in later childhood and in adult life, although in such cases, the precipitants tend to be different, for example, involving bloodletting (Roddy et al. 1983) or dental extractions.

He is a left-handed opening batsman. Career=Domestic career Adam Lyth collecting the 2008 Yorkshire County Cricket Club Young Player of the Year award from Stewart Regan. Born 25 September 1987, Whitby, North Yorkshire, Lyth made his first- team debut for Yorkshire in a Pro40 match in 2006, and his first-class debut in May 2007, against Loughborough UCCE. He was with the England Under-16 squad to South Africa, and the England U-19 squad to Malaysia and India, and home against Pakistan. In the 2008 season, he scored 645 runs in the County Championship, won the Yorkshire County Cricket Club Young Player of the Year award, and signed a three-year contract with Yorkshire at the end of the season. On 24 August 2010, Lyth was awarded his county cap on his home ground at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough, before the start of Yorkshire's County Championship match against Hampshire. At the County Championship match against Leicestershire at Grace Road in July 2012, Lyth created a county record, by becoming the first Yorkshire batsman to score over 200 runs, whilst carrying his bat through an entire innings. He also totalled a first-class career best of 248 not out. On 17 August 2017, Lyth scored the highest ever individual score in the T20 Blast. He scored 161 from 73 deliveries, which consisted of 20 fours and 7 sixes, against Northamptonshire. He built an opening partnership of 127 runs with Tom Kohler-Cadmore. Yorkshire won by 124 runs. International career In March 2015, Lyth was named in the England Test squad for the tour of the West Indies, but did not play in the series, with Jonathan Trott being preferred instead. He made his Test debut for England against New Zealand in May 2015 and scored his first Test run off the first ball of the game. He failed to make a significant score in either innings, being dismissed for just seven in the first innings and then losing his wicket while on 12 in the second. Despite this, England went on to win the game by 124 runs to go 1‚Äì0 up in the series. In the second Test, Lyth top scored for England with 107, helping them to post 350. However, he could not follow this up in the second innings, being dismissed for 24 as England lost the game by 199 runs to draw the series 1‚Äì1. Lyth was selected as England's opener for the 2015 Ashes series. Lyth was subsequently dropped from the Test side after the Ashes series after gaining a total of 111 runs from 9 innings. Outside cricket Lyth's brother Ashley was also a cricketer and footballer, representing Yorkshire 2nds at cricket and making over 100 appearances for Scarborough. A broken leg put paid to a career with Leicester City. Lyth himself also had football trials as a youngster, with Manchester City. He played football at semi professional level for Whitby Town F.C. in the Northern Premier League. His only appearance was coming on as a substitute against Runcorn in 2006 in a 4‚Äì0 victory.

Their traditional lands cover from Crooked River in the north to Clyde River in the south, from the coast (Roseby Park) in the east to the mountains in the west (Braidwood, New South Wales). It includes the areas of Shoalhaven which include Jervis Bay, Culburra Beach, Orient Point, Greenwell Point and Shoalhaven Heads. History Contemporary Jerrinja descend from those peoples who gathered or were gathered into the Roseby Park Aboriginal Reserve around the early 1900s. In 1983, following on from the provisions of the recent NSW Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983, ownership of the Roseby Park was transferred to the Jerrinja Local Aboriginal Land Council. Many Jerrinja people have been strongly involved in the Aboriginal Land Rights struggles for more than fifty years.

Design and development The Aichi E16A originated from a 1939 specification for a replacement for the Aichi E13A, which at that time had yet to be accepted by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS).Francillon 1979, p. 284. Disagreements about the requirements in the 14-Shi specification prevented most manufacturers from submitting designs, but in 1941 a new 16-Shi specification was drafted by the IJNAS around the Aichi AM-22 design which had already been made by Aichi engineers Kishiro Matsuo and Yasuhiro Ozawa. The first AM-22, which first got the experimental designation Navy Experimental 16-Shi Reconnaissance Seaplane and later the short designation E16A1, was completed by May 1942 and was a conventional, low-wing monoplane equipped with two floats and had the unusual (for a seaplane) feature of being equipped with dive brakes, located in the front legs of the float struts, to allow it to operate in a secondary role as a dive bomber.

Davis was previously the head coach at Middle Tennessee. His head coaching experience also includes brief stops at Idaho (twice) and Texas A&M.; Early life and family Davis's father, Kermit Sr., was the head coach at Mississippi State University for seven seasons, ending in 1977. He was an alumnus of the school and was promoted to head coach at age 34 after four years as an assistant for the Bulldogs. In his first season in 1971, he was named SEC Coach of the Year. The younger Davis graduated from high school in 1978 and then played at Phillips County Community College in Arkansas for two years, and transferred to hometown Mississippi State, where he played two seasons and earned a bachelor's degree in 1982 and a master's in 1984 while a graduate assistant. He and his wife, Betty, have two daughters, Ally and Claire. Daughter Claire is an Oakland High School (Tennessee) graduate and business major at Mississippi State University. On June 10, 2017, Claire married Fletcher Johnson. Fletcher is a Tupelo High School graduate and the 2010 State Amateur Golf Champion. Fletcher, like his wife, attended Mississippi State University where he majored in Finance and played for the Mississippi State Bulldogs on the golf team. Coaching career When promoted from assistant to head coach at Idaho in 1988 at age 28, Davis was the youngest head coach in NCAA Division I. He had been an assistant for two seasons with the Vandals under new and first- time head coach Tim Floyd, who left for New Orleans. Floyd had rejuvenated the program and under Davis, Idaho had consecutive 25‚Äì6 () seasons in 1989 and 1990, winning the Big Sky regular season and tournament titles to make the NCAA tournament both years. Davis left the Palouse for Texas A&M; of the Southwest Conference in March 1990, but resigned a year later after an 8‚Äì21 () first season in which he committed rules violations that landed A&M; on two years probation and resulted in a two-year show-cause order against Davis himself. After three years at Chipola Junior College and two seasons as an assistant at Utah State, Davis returned to Idaho as head coach in March 1996, then left a year later to become associate head coach under John Brady at LSU. Davis became head coach at Middle Tennessee in 2002. He led winning records in his first four seasons but first made a postseason tournament in 2010 at the CollegeInsider.com Tournament. Middle Tennessee followed that with appearances in the 2012 NIT and 2013 NCAA Tournament. Middle Tennessee moved from the Sun Belt Conference to Conference USA for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Following an appearance in the 2015 CollegeInsider.com Tournament, Middle Tennessee made the 2016 NCAA Tournament by way of winning the C-USA Tournament. In the first round of the NCAA Tournament as a #15 seed, Middle Tennessee upset #2 seed (and AP-ranked #2) Michigan State 90‚Äì81. Middle Tennessee then lost the second-round game to #10 seed Syracuse 75‚Äì50. The following season Middle Tennessee made it to the second round a second consecutive year by upsetting #5 seed Minnesota, but again losing in the second round, this time to #4 seed (and AP-ranked #21) Butler. At the conclusion of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Davis was named the head coach at Ole Miss. Davis led the Rebels to the NCAA Tournament in his first season, where they lost to Oklahoma in the first round.
