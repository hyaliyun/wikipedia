The episode was originally aired on the CBS television network on December 13, 2012. The story was created by Chuck Lorre, Eric Kaplan and Steve Holland, and turned into a teleplay by Steven Molaro, Jim Reynolds, and Maria Ferrari. Mark Cendrowski directed the episode. The series depicts a group of male friends employed at the California Institute of Technology, and their relationships with others. In this episode, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) runs a Christmas-themed Dungeons & Dragons game for his friends. Meanwhile, Penny (Kaley Cuoco) and the girls take Raj (Kunal Nayyar) to a club. \\"The Santa Simulation\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics, with comparisons being made to other shows such as Arrested Development and Community due to the relationships and the Dungeons & Dragons game. The episode was viewed by 16.77 million viewers and received a 5.4/17 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking first in its timeslot. The Big Bang Theory was also ranked as the highest-rated program of the night. Plot Leonard, Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Howard (Simon Helberg) each inform their girlfriends that they are participating in a game of Dungeons & Dragons and that the girls are banned from participating, while Raj informs Stuart (Kevin Sussman). The game begins at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, with Leonard as the dungeon master, who reveals the game has a Christmas theme by giving Sheldon a scroll in a Christmas stocking and telling them that their characters have to save Santa Claus from hungry ogres. Sheldon is not happy, but the game begins with Raj's character dying in the first room of the dungeon after walking into a trap. The girls enter the apartment and do a runway show for the boys in sexy dresses (with the exception of Amy (Mayim Bialik), who has a dress Penny describes as from \\"Forever 63\\") in an attempt to persuade their boyfriends to go with them to the bar. None of the boys pay any interest except Raj, who wishes to go as his character is already dead. After the girls initially refuse, they allow Raj to go with them. When the girls and Raj arrive at the club, they decide to find a girl for Raj, who initially says that he requires someone physically attractive before admitting that he would take anyone. In the game, a trapped room requires the singing of the carol \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" to prevent all the characters from being crushed to death. Although he only needs to sing the first verse, Sheldon insists on finishing the song. Raj returns to the girl's table with a fake email address from a girl. Disappointed, he complains that he cannot find anyone and laments about how he used to fancy both Penny and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Amy suggests that at some point he had found her attractive, to which he responds that he never has, despite encouragement from both Penny and Bernadette to agree. Leonard tells Sheldon that he is pleased to see he has found his holiday spirit, and the two discuss their childhood Christmas experiences. Amy and Raj connect over their failed love lives, and Raj suggests that he would like to find someone like her. Satisfied, she leaves the club with the others in tow. Raj laments to Penny that he may now find Amy attractive. In the game, the latest puzzle results in the boys playing \\"Jingle Bells\\" on bells in order to lower a drawbridge. Their characters find Santa and are about to release him when Sheldon double crosses the group, paralyzing the other characters and throwing away the only key to Santa's shackles. Sheldon explains to \\"Santa\\" that Sheldon's maternal grandfather (whom he called \\"Pop-Pop\\") was the only member of his family who supported his scientific pursuits. \\"Pop-Pop\\" died when Sheldon was five and Sheldon asked Santa, that Christmas at a mall, that the only thing he wanted for Christmas was for Santa to bring \\"Pop-Pop\\" back, but instead received a set of Lincoln Logs, so Sheldon does not save Santa but instead leaves him in the dungeon to be eaten by ogres. The episode ends with Sheldon dreaming that Santa (Dakin Matthews) is visiting him in his apartment. He explains that bringing back Sheldon's grandfather was outside of his powers and apologizes for not being able to do so. However, he then surprises Sheldon by firing a cannon at him in revenge for leaving him to be eaten by ogres. After Santa states \\"Ho-ho-ho, you big dork!\\", Sheldon wakes up from the nightmare. Production \\"The Santa Simulation\\" marks the second appearance of Dungeons & Dragons in a Big Bang Theory plot. It previously appeared in season 5's \\"The Wiggly Finger Catalyst\\". Broadcast and reception Ratings \\"The Santa Simulation\\" originally aired on CBS on December 13, 2012. The episode was viewed by 16.77 million viewers and received a 5.4/17% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. It was top in its timeslot, ahead of the Fox Network's reality television singing competition The X Factor which received a 2.4/7 percent rating and an episode of the ABC drama series Last Resort, which received a 1.0/3 percent rating. The Big Bang Theory was also the highest rated television show of the night. Reviews The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sara thought that the episode made Sheldon more sympathetic, while changing the dynamic between Raj and Stuart to something similar to Tobias F√ºnke and Michael Bluth from Arrested Development. He hoped that the writers would commit to answering the question finally on whether or not Raj is homosexual, and gave the episode an overall grade of \\"B\\". IGN writer Jesse Schedeen enjoyed both halves of the episode, but felt that the girls' bar scenes needed more time. While he compared the use of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in the episode to \\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\\" that of the series Community, he said the \\"results were characteristically brilliant\\", but that the \\"D&D; adventure was more of a loose framing device in this case\\". He compared Sheldon's breakdown in the episode to that of Pierce Hawthorne in the Community episode, and thought that Sheldon's family revelation was dealt with in a silly manner rather than something \\"overly depressing\\". He also enjoyed the beginnings of a new bond between Raj and Amy. He summarised the episode by saying \\"Season 6 has generally been underwhelming after a fairly strong start. This was the first episode in a while that I genuinely enjoyed without any real reservations.\\" Carla Day of TV Fanatic doubted she would have enjoyed the episode more if she was a Dungeons & Dragons player. She was left disappointed by the girl's bar scenes, and thought the \\"only entertaining moment was when Raj and Amy bonded over their youthful woes with the opposite sex\\". She thought the boy's side of the episode fell flat, with the exception of Sheldon singing and the bell scene. ScreenCrave's Candace Butler enjoyed the manner in which Leonard had tailored the experience, saying \\"we like how his desire to save Santa mimics our desire to retain holiday traditions of caroling, presents or a holiday-themed mocha at Starbucks\\". She gave the episode an overall score of 9/10, and said, \\"The Santa Simulation\\" was a thought- provoking and humorous Christmas-themed episode. Big Bang Theory did not disappoint when exploring Christmastime, gender roles and innuendo.\\" Maane Khatchatourian for Entertainment Weekly thought that it wasn't as good a Christmas episode as season 2's \\"The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis\\", but that \\"it was hilarious and heartfelt, nonetheless\\". They were pleased with Raj getting more attention in the episode, but also felt that the two sides of the episode reaffirmed the stereotypes of the characters.

The stories had all previously been published in various anthologies and magazines; they may be described, somewhat interchangeably, as science fiction, fantasy literature, metafiction and macabre. Stories *\\"An Infinite Summer\\" (1976) *\\"Whores\\" (1978) *\\"Palely Loitering\\" (1979) *\\"The Negation\\" (1978) *\\"The Watched\\" (1978) The material in the collection may be divided into two types: the first, namely \\"An Infinite Summer\\" and \\"Palely Loitering\\" are more straightforward works of science fiction involving time travel, while the other three are early parts of Priest's \\"Dream Archipelago\\" sequence, described by John Clute as \\"intensify[ing] the sense that Priest's landscapes had now become forms of expression of the psyche, and are of intense interest for the dream-like convolutions of psychic terrain so displayed.\\" Priest would later revisit the setting at length in novels such as The Affirmation and, in 1999, these early stories would be revised and reassembled with other material as The Dream Archipelago. \\"An Infinite Summer\\" was originally published in the anthology Andromeda 1 (1976, ed. Peter Weston, ). A time travel story, it was reprinted in later anthologies, such as Trips in Time (1977, ed. Robert Silverberg, ), and in translation. It was selected for The Best Science Fiction of the Year 6 by editor Terry Carr. Priest says that he interrupted the writing of his 1976 novel The Space Machine (\\"somewhere in Chapter 13, to be precise\\"), and chose to publish the story separately \\"because there was one strong feeling that would not fit in the novel: the sense that layers of time exist, that places do not change so much as people.\\" In August, 1940, protagonist Thomas Lloyd daily visits the Thames Bridge in Richmond, London, England. He spots \\"freezers\\" around the park; freezers is his term for people from an unknown future who, for unknown reasons, will occasionally use a device to freeze people out of time. These frozen people remain visible only to the freezers and to others, like Thomas, who were once frozen. In June, 1903, Thomas was frozen at the very moment of proposing to a lovely young lady, Sarah, who accepted him. Thomas remained frozen in this tableau until 1935, after which he finds that the frozen are considered, by their contemporaries, to have vanished. He is now disinherited and poor; he learns that freezing may \\"erode\\" after minutes or years; and he finds what work he can in the vicinity so that he may visit Sarah, in her radiant immobility, every day. \\"Thomas Lloyd, of neither the past nor the present, saw himself as a product of both, and as a victim of the future.\\" After long, patient waiting, he sees Sarah unfreeze during The Blitz. The freezers have watched Thomas; when Sarah awakes, blissful but baffled by the bombing, they restore their tableau, presumably so that the lovers will wake again in a kinder future. If so, this is one of Priest's happier endings. \\"Whores\\" was written immediately prior to his novel A Dream of Wessex. It was originally published in the anthology New Dimensions: Science Fiction: 8 (1978, ed. Robert Silverberg, ). It was reprinted in later anthologies and in translation. It was selected for Best Science Fiction Stories of the Year: Eighth Annual Collection (1979) by Gardner Dozois. \\"Whores\\" is a nightmare from the vagina dentata school of folk tales. It is narrated by a soldier, recovering from a blast of \\"the enemy's synaesthetic gas\\", who is sent to the Archipelago island of Winho to convalesce. There he hopes to find a young prostitute whom he had loved, Slenje, but she is dead. He is seduced by Elva, who has been \\"experimented upon\\" when Winho was occupied by enemy troops. According to her, their enemies are the real whores, not prostitutes like herself. He enjoys the sex, but several incidents disturb him beyond his momentary flashes of synesthesia: Elva's legs are bizarrely scarred, her teeth have been filed into points; when her year-old boy in the next room cries because he has hurt his hand, Elva soothes him by sucking his little hand into her mouth; while Elva pleasures the soldier, he \\"visualized her as some monstrous animal, chewing into my gut. It was the most hideous image of woman.\\" The next day, boarding a ferry, the soldier realizes that Elva had teased his torso with her teeth; these are now becoming open wounds. When he reaches into his pocket to pay the ferryman, a tiny child's hand, severed at the wrist, seizes his fingers and will not let go. In his Introduction, Priest writes that he wrote the story at Christmas. \\"There the resemblance to good cheer ends, as you will discover, and in retrospect think I must have eaten too much plum duff.\\" \\"Palely Loitering\\" was originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in the January 1979 issue; Priest reaped the cover illustration by Ron Walotsky. Anthologist Terry Carr selected the story for The Best Science Fiction Novellas of the Year #2 (1980; ), and Mike Ashley chose it likewise for The Mammoth Book of Time Travel SF (2013; ). The story has been translated several times. The title is harvested from the ballad La Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats; the relevant lines run: > 1 O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, > 2 Alone and palely loitering? > . . . > 41 I saw their starved lips in the gloam, > 42 With horrid warning gap√®d wide, > 43 And I awoke and found me here, > 44 On the cold hill's side. > 45 And this is why I sojourn here, > 46 Alone and palely loitering... \\"Palely Loitering\\" earned the BSFA Award for Best Short Fiction in 1979. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1980, and was further nominated for the 1980 Locus Award for Best Novella. Priest remarked of \\"Palely Loitering\\" that it \\"was written soon after I returned from a long and very happy stay in Melbourne, Australia. It was an attempt to think myself back into a European sensibility; visiting Australia is like seeing the past and future simultaneously, and the familiar and unfamiliar at once.\\" \\"The Negation\\" was originally published in Anticipations, a 1978 anthology edited by Priest; it has been collected here in An Infinite Summer and in his The Dream Archipelago (1999). In French translation, it has been anthologized in Le livre d'or de la Science-Fiction: Christopher Priest (1980) and L'Archipel du R√™ve (1981). Of his collection An Infinite Summer, Priest wrote, \\"'The Negation' also fits into the [Dream Archipelago] series, although in a slightly different way.\\" Dik, an eighteen-year-old policeman, looks eagerly forward to the visit of novelist Moylita Kaine, author of The Affirmation (the title of Priest's own 1981 metafictional novel). From her and from the events surrounding her visit, he learns more about the nature of his world and about the limitations that even novelists may face. \\"The Watched\\" was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in the April 1978 issue; it was nominated for the 1979 Hugo Award for Best Novella and the 1979 Locus Award for Best Novella. Anthologist Terry Carr selected the story for The Best Science Fiction Novellas of the Year #1 (1979; ). Priest has said that he wrote \\"The Watched\\" immediately after finishing A Dream of Wessex.

In 2015, Borris joined Ballengee Group. Education Borris earned his bachelor degree in political science from California State University, Northridge and a Juris Doctor from Southwestern Law School. Borris was an adjunct professor of sports law at Southwestern Law School from 1993 to 2001. Personal Borris was born in Los Angeles and raised in the San Fernando Valley.

He is best known as a founder and director of Defense Distributed, a non-profit organization that develops and publishes open source gun designs, so-called \\"wiki weapons\\", suitable for 3D printing and digital manufacture. He is a co-founder of the Dark Wallet bitcoin storage technology, and currently serving a felony probation sentence. Defense Distributed gained international notoriety in 2013 when it published plans online for the Liberator, a functioning pistol that could be reproduced with a 3D printer. Wired Magazines \\"Danger Room\\" named Wilson one of \\"The 15 Most Dangerous People in the World\\" in 2012. In 2015 and 2017 Wired named Wilson one of the five most dangerous people on the Internet, and in 2019 named him one of the most dangerous people on the Internet of the decade. Early life and education Originally from Little Rock, Arkansas, Wilson was student body president at Cabot High School in Cabot, Arkansas; he graduated in 2006. Wilson graduated from the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) with a bachelor's degree in English in 2010, where he had a scholarship. While at UCA, Wilson was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and was elected president of UCA's Student Government Association. He traveled to China with UCA's study-abroad program. In 2012, he studied at the University of Texas School of Law, but left the university in 2013. Career Defense Distributed In 2012, Wilson and associates at Defense Distributed started the Wiki Weapon Project to raise funds for designing and releasing the files for a 3D printable gun. At the time Wilson was the project's only spokesperson; he called himself \\"co-founder\\" and \\"director.\\" Learning of Defense Distributed's plans, manufacturer Stratasys threatened legal action and demanded the return of a 3D printer it had leased to Wilson. On September 26, 2012, before the printer was assembled for use, Wilson received an email from Stratasys suggesting he was using the printer \\"for illegal purposes\\". Stratasys immediately canceled its lease with Wilson and sent a team to confiscate the printer. While visiting the office of the ATF in Austin to inquire about legalities related to his project, Wilson was interrogated by the officers there. Six months later, he was issued a Federal Firearms License (FFL) to manufacture and deal. In May 2013, Wilson successfully test-fired a pistol called \\"the Liberator\\" that reportedly was made using a Stratasys Dimension series 3D printer purchased on eBay. After test firing, Wilson released the blueprints of the gun's design online through a Defense Distributed website. The State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance demanded that Wilson remove the files, threatening prosecution for violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). In October 2014, Defense Distributed began selling to the public a miniature CNC mill named Ghost Gunner for completing receivers for the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. On May 6, 2015, Defense Distributed and the Second Amendment Foundation filed Defense Distributed v. U.S. Dept. of State, a constitutional challenge of the ITAR regime used to control their speech. On July 10, 2018, the State Department offered to settle this lawsuit and Wilson again began the work at DEFCAD. While under indictment for sexual assault in September 2018, Wilson briefly resigned from Defense Distributed, again assuming the role of director in 2019. Dark Wallet In 2013, Wilson, along with Amir Taaki, began work on a Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet called Dark Wallet, a project by which he planned to help anonymize financial transactions. He appeared on behalf of the Dark Wallet project at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas in 2014. Bitcoin Foundation On U.S. election day, November 4, 2014, Wilson announced in an interview that he would stand for election to a seat on the Board of Directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, with \\"the sole purpose of destroying the Foundation.\\" And Wilson stated: \\"I will run on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation and will begin and end every single one of my public statements with that message.\\" Hatreon Wilson launched a website in 2017 to provide crowdfunding and payment services for groups and individuals who were banned from platforms such as Kickstarter, Patreon, PayPal, and Stripe. His site went live in August 2017 and attracted high- profile alt-right and neo-Nazi figures, including Andrew Anglin and Richard B. Spencer. While Wilson said that Hatreon clients included \\"right-wing women, people of color, and transgender people,\\" Bloomberg News reported that most of the donations went to white supremacists. According to Hannah Shearer, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hatreon users were inciting violence contrary to Hatreon's terms of service, which forbid illegal activity. The site claimed to have received about $25,000 a month in donations, an amount that was \\"doubling from month to month.\\" Hatreon took a 5-percent cut of donations. Within several months of Hatreon's launch, the site's payments processor, Visa, suspended its financial services. Without the means to process payments, the site became inactive. Political and economic views Wilson claims an array of influences from anti-state and libertarian political thinkers, including left-wing market anarchists such as mutualist theorist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, paleolibertarian anarcho-capitalists such as Austrian School economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, and classical liberals such as Frederic Bastiat. His political thought has been compared to the \\"conservative revolutionary\\" ideas of Ernst J√ºnger. Jacob Siegel wrote that \\"Cody Wilson arrives at a place where left, right‚Äîand democracy‚Äîdisappear\\" and that he oscillates \\"somewhere between anarch and anarchist.\\" Wilson is an avowed crypto-anarchist, and has discussed his work in relation to the cypherpunks and Timothy May's vision. He frequently cites the work of post-Marxist thinkers in public comments, especially that of Jean Baudrillard, whom he has claimed as his \\"master.\\" Asked during an interview with Popular Science if the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting affected his thinking or plans in any way, Wilson responded, \\"... understanding that rights and civil liberties are something that we protect is also understanding that they have consequences that are also protected, or tolerated. The exercise of civil liberties is antithetical to the idea of a completely totalizing state. That's just the way it is.\\" Wilson is generally opposed to intellectual property rights. He has indicated that although his primary goal is the subversion of state- structures, he also hopes that his contributions may help to dismantle the existing system of capitalist property relations. In a January 2013 interview with Glenn Beck on the nature of and motivations behind his effort to develop and share gun 3D printable files Wilson said, \\"That's a real political act, giving you a magazine, telling you that it will never be taken away. ... That's real politics. That's radical equality. That's what I believe in. ... I'm just resisting. What am I resisting? I don't know, the collectivization of manufacture? The institutionalization of the human psyche? I'm not sure. But I can tell you one thing: this is a symbol of irreversibility. They can never eradicate the gun from the earth.\\" Legal issues On December 28, 2018, Wilson was formally indicted for sexual assault after an encounter with a minor he met on SugarDaddyMeet, a website that matches older men with younger women. He was accused of committing a second-degree felony for paying a 16-year old girl $500 for sex in a hotel room in Austin, Texas in August 2018. When the police issued a warrant for his arrest, Wilson was overseas in to Taipei, Taiwan. Wilson was deported by the Taiwanese National Immigration Agency (NIA), charged with an immigration violation, and his passport was revoked by the U.S. government. After he was returned to the U.S. by the United States Marshals Service on September 23, 2018, he was released on $150,000 bond from Harris County Jail in Houston, Texas. On August 9, 2019, following his formal indictment in December 2018, Wilson pleaded guilty to a single, third-degree felony charge of injury to a child. He was sentenced to seven years of probation, during which time he may be required to register as a sex offender, 475 hours of community service, and ordered to pay a $1,200.00 fine.Mattisse, Nathan (January 3, 2019) \\"Texas indicts Cody Wilson on multiple counts of sexual assault of a minor.\\" ArsTechnica.

The other lists attest to a single language, though the dialect of the Tamar River region (North Midlands tribe) is divergent, and Dixon & Crowley consider it to be a distinct language.

Says the author: \\"All the characters and villages of Christian settlers were in my mind long before I began thinking about writing Ayussinte Pusthakam. The characters are based on people I met during my course as a school teacher in a village in Kasaragod. I wrote Ayussinte Pusthakam at a time when I was going through an emotionally difficult period; my relation with my father was strained and I was feeling very lonely. Ayussinte Pusthakam is about loneliness. The book is also about sin and sadness, written in a style and language that have been judiciously borrowed from The Bible.\\" The protagonist in this novel is Yohannan, and the plot revolves around his ambiguities concerning sexual desire.\\"Book of life\\"  References  Category:2009 Indian novels Category:Indian plays Category:Malayalam novels ","title":"Ayussinte Pusthakam"},{"id":"37976895","text":"Sonqorabad (, also Romanized as SonqorƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Saruq Rural District, Saruq District, Farahan County, Markazi Province, Iran.

In 1969, he was appointed to NASA's Safety Advisory Group for Space Flight. In 1974, he was honored with NASA's Silver Snoopy Award, presented by Brigadier General Thomas P. Stafford, veteran astronaut of the Gemini 6A, Gemini 9A, and Apollo 10 space programs. In 1983, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the National Transportation Safety Board, where he pioneered the concept of multiple causation of accidents. Following his appointment to the NTSB, he was appointed to serve as a member of the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee. In 1997, Vice President Al Gore requested his assistance and expertise on the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. Following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, Grose testified before the US Congress on behalf of the NTSB, presenting findings of the Board's formal investigation into the attacks. Grose has served as an executive and consultant with several organizations and corporations. , he serves as the Chairman of Omega Systems Group in Arlington, Virginia. He has provided keynote addresses and lectured in academic, government, and religious settings for over 50 years. He has also served as a member of the faculty, adjunct professor, and guest lecturer at universities throughout the world, including Germany, Mexico, China, Spain, and the US. In 1969, he garnered national press, when he addressed the California State Board of Education regarding science guidelines for teaching science and evolution in the public school system. He successfully proposed academic guidelines that supported teaching creation as a scientific theory, alongside the teaching of evolution. As a result of the Board of Education's decision to incorporate alternative scientific theories into their curriculum, other states throughout the US followed suit and revised their academic guidelines accordingly.  Personal background  Vernon Leslie Grose was born on June 27, 1928, in Spokane, Washington. He is the son of Wesley and Pearl (n√©e Quantz) Grose.Grose, Vernon L. (2006). Science But Not Scientists, AuthorHouse, page 50. His father was an automobile mechanic, while his mother was a telephone operator for the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company. His siblings include sister, Lois, and brother, Gerald.\\"Pearl Grose\\", Spokane Daily Chronicle, February 21, 1989, page 10. Grose was raised in northwest Spokane, graduating from North Central High School in 1946. In 1997, Grose was honored as an inaugural recipient of the North Central High School Distinguished Alumnus Award. Fellow recipients included Spokane Mayor, Jack Geraghty; US Congressman, George Nethercutt; Jerry Sage, WWII prisoner of war portrayed by Steve McQueen in the movie, the Great Escape; and musician Don Eagle, who toured with the USO during WWII and appeared in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (with fellow-Spokanite Bing Crosby), Night Has a Thousand Eyes (with Edward G. Robinson), and The Strip (with Mickey Rooney). Following high school, Grose enrolled at Whitworth University in north Spokane, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1950. He served as a member of Whitworth's Alumni Association Board of Directors from 1968 to 1970. Whitworth University honored him with the 2013 Distinguished Alumni Award. He earned the Master of Science degree in Systems Management in 1967, from the University of Southern California. In 1973, Grose received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Southern California College, for his work in \\"forcing re-examination of scientific objectivity regarding the origin of the universe, life and man\\". In conferring the degree, the school president, Emil A. Balliet stated of Grose, \\"He has the rare and unusual ability to discern the broad issues in the world at many levels and he has the skill to go directly to the heart of the problem. Most impressive has been his leadership role in establishing the case for design as opposed to the case for chance in the study of origins in California State public school textbooks.\\" Grose graduated from Whitworth University three weeks before North Korea's invasion of South Korea. In 1951, following his graduation, he began serving with the United States Air Force. In 1952, he was commissioned as an Electronics Officer, later serving in Technical Intelligence with the Air Force Reserve. He retired in 1972 with the rank of Captain.2001 Who's Who in the World, 18th Edition, Marquis Who's Who, 21st Century Editions, He married Phyllis Jean Heine in Spokane on April 14, 1951, at the First Assembly of God church.\\"Couple Are Wed\\", Spokane Daily Chronicle, May 1, 1951, page 46 Together, they had six children, Rhonda Susan Chumley, Brenda Ruth Tutmarc, Lynnda Lorelle Owens, Wesley Paul Grose, Bradley Wayne Grose, and Nanette Jill Shotwell.Grose, Vernon L.

They relocated to the Washington D.C. area in 1983, when he was sworn into public office with the National Transportation Safety Board. , Grose and his wife reside in Arlington, Virginia.  Professional background   Aerospace engineering  In 1952, following his graduation from Whitworth University, Grose joined the staff at Boeing, working with the Applied Physics department. While at Boeing, he wrote the test documentation for the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic thermonuclear missile. He was also responsible for Boeing's initial testing, which utilized three separate and dynamic environments at the same time. He remained with Boeing through 1959. After working with Boeing, Grose joined the staff of Litton Industries in Woodland Hills, California, where he served as the Director of Reliability and Program Manager of Project SPARR, an Air Force program designed to address general and applied research problems related to space systems. He was responsible for overseeing an applied research space systems risk management program on behalf of the United States Air Force. Grose joined the staff of Northrop Ventura in Rancho El Conejo, California, in 1962, serving as the Director of Applied Technology. In this role, he was responsible for test activities for the engineering department. He participated in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo projects of the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), overseeing the chemistry, metallurgy, reliability, configuration management, and value engineering of the program. In 1964, he transferred to Rocketdyne, which was a division of Rockwell International. At Rocketdyne, located in Van Nuys, Grose was named the Chief of Reliability, where he continued to focus on North American aviation, specifically participating in the development of the Gemini and Apollo space programs.  Academia and public speaking  Grose has provided keynote addresses and lectured in academic, government, and religious settings for over 50 years. In 1967, he was named the Vice President of Tustin Institute of Technology (now known as Technical Training, Inc.), located in Santa Barbara, California.\\"Technology Can't Solve Man's Problems ‚Äì Man Must Change\\", Kokomo Tribune (Associated Press), October 28, 1970, page 39 He was responsible for the development of management curricula and system technology studies. While serving as Vice President of the school through 1981, Grose provided training for management of eight NASA field centers, including Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Lewis Research Center, Langley Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He has served as a member of the faculty, adjunct professor, and guest lecturer at universities throughout the world, including Germany, China, Spain, and the US. He served as an adjunct professor with USC in Los Angeles from 1967‚Äì1969. He taught Physics and Chemistry of Aircraft & Missile Propulsion at the University of Southern California (USC) Graduate School at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, in 1967. He then taught Space Technology and Management of Research, Development, Test & Evaluation from 1968 to 1969, at Torrej√≥n Air Base in Madrid and Mor√≥n Air Base in Seville, Spain, again on behalf of USC's Graduate School. In 1968, Grose began teaching Continuing Education courses in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., remaining there for 15 years. During this time, he taught classes in Risk Management, System Safety, Medical Risk, Systems Management. In 1981, he was invited to lecture students in Systematic Management of Risk at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the People's Republic of China.\\"Vernon Grose\\", The Modesto Bee, May 10, 1973, page 10 He taught for UCLA in its Mexican Institute of Development course in Mexico City in 1976. () As California governor, Ronald Reagan, appointed Grose to several state government committees, councils, and boards focusing on a range of issues from the implementation of technology to addressing and resolving socio-economic and judicial problems. Appointments were made to the Governor's Select Committee on Law Enforcement Problems, serving from 1972 to 1973; the California Council on Criminal Justice, serving from 1971 to 1973; and the Board of Directors of the California Crime Technological Research Foundation, serving from 1972 to 1975. In 1972, he was appointed to the California Curriculum Development Commission, which is responsible for approving textbooks and curriculum for public schools throughout the state. He served on the Commission through 1975. From 1980 to 1991, Grose served as an expert consultant and lecturer on behalf of the American Society of Safety Engineers of Des Plaines, Illinois. In addition to academic settings, Grose has spoken at local and regional religious conferences on behalf of the Assemblies of God, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, and the Full Gospel Businessmen's Fellowship International.  Safety and risk management  As a result of his background and expertise in aeronautical and aerospace risk management and analysis, Grose has received presidential and federal appointments to various panels and committees addressing risk and safety measures related to aircraft and maritime disasters. In 1969, Wernher von Braun, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center, appointed Grose to serve a two-year term on NASA's Safety Advisory Group for Space Flight in Huntsville, Alabama. Under von Braun's leadership, he served as a member of the team that designed the Saturn V booster rocket, which served as the launching vehicle on the Apollo spacecraft, enabling the first landing of men on the Moon. Grose was appointed to the Panel on Human Error in Merchant Marine Safety in 1972, by the National Academy of Sciences. Six years later, in 1978, he was appointed to the Committee on Research Needs to Reduce Maritime Collisions, Rammings, and Groundings. That same year, he was also appointed to the Panel on Causes and Prevention of Grain Elevator Explosions.National Research Council Panel on Causes and Prevention of Grain Elevator Explosions, National Research Council, National Materials Advisory Board, National Academy of Sciences (1982). Prevention of Grain Elevator and Mill Explosions, National Academies, page 133 He was honored with NASA's Silver Snoopy Award in 1974, in recognition of professional service related to spaceflight safety and mission success, specifically for providing \\"interesting and highly motivational insight into the management aspects of system safety as applied to space programs\\". The certificate awarded additionally thanks Grose for support provided to the NASA astronauts through his lectures and was presented at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, by Brigadier General Thomas P. Stafford, veteran astronaut of the Gemini 6A, Gemini 9A, and Apollo 10 manned spaceflights, as well as the Apollo-Soyuz joint US-Soviet space mission. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Grose to a two-year term as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in recognition of his professional background and comprehensive knowledge of air, land, and sea modes of travel and transportation. As a member of the NTSB, he oversaw the organization's investigation of major accidents. From 1984 to 1985, he served through the White House as an expert consultant assigned to NASA's Chief Engineer in Washington D.C. In 1985, he was assigned to serve as a consultant to the EPA Associate Administrator for Research and Development. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Grose to the National Highway Safety Advisory Commission, which serves under the direction of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Grose founded Omega Systems Group in 1995. He served as the chairman of the organization from 1981‚Äì83, and again from 1986 to the present. The organization offers consulting in risk management and loss prevention, along with providing expertise witness services. Omega Systems Group is known for developing management risk methodology for use by organizations in a variety of fields. Under the guidance of Grose, the organization designed and developed a risk management methodology, known as SMART (Systems Methodology Applied to Risk Termination). The technique is a corporate budget system for addressing and mitigating legal, political, social, economic, and technological loss. The system has been used by AT&T;, Exxon, NASA, and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. () In 1984, SMART was successfully utilized to combat terrorism at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. () In 1997, Vice President Al Gore requested his assistance and expertise on the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, which was established by President Bill Clinton following the TWA Flight 800 disaster over the Atlantic Ocean on July 17, 1996. Also known as the Gore Commission, the study was organized and designed to review and implement strategies to improve civil aviation safety, ensure aviation security, and modernize air traffic control policies, standards, and technologies. After gathering recommendations, which primarily focused on increasing security measures, the Commission finalized its report and forwarded it to President Clinton, eight months after the disaster. As a result of the study, Congress earmarked over $400 million to enhance commercial airlines with improved security measures and new explosives detection technology. ()  California Science Framework  Another wave of controversy occurred during this period, and that was the teaching of evolution in the public schools, and other science concepts and ideas that touched on beliefs, religion, values and morals (e.g. teaching human sexuality, human reproduction, and birth control in biology classes, for example). But it was Darwin's evolutionary theory that resulted in court cases, and laws being passed to regulate the teaching of evolution (such as giving equal time to \\"creation science\\" if \\"evolution science\\" was presented in a science class. A phenomenon that reached its pinnacle during this time was the general scrutiny of textbooks, especially in biology, Earth science, social studies, and literature. In the 1960s, when BSCS, whose textbooks emphasized Darwin's theory of evolution (in contrast to many high school biology texts as the time), submitted its books for state adoption in the lucrative market of Texas, serious trouble surfaced. The Reverend Ruel Lemmons led a protest (that reached the Texas Governor's office) to the get the BSCS textbooks banned claiming the books were pure evolution, completely materialistic and atheistic. The books were not banned, but there were changes made to lighten their evolutionary emphasis. Nelkin reports that BSCS had to specify that evolution theory was a theory, not a fact, and that it had been modified, not strengthened by recent research. This was just the tip of the iceberg. A group of fundamentalists began to develop a world view of creation based on the story in Genesis in the Holy Bible. The creationists rejected the notion of a 5 billion year old Earth, instead claiming that biological life began approximately five to six thousand years ago. One of the forceful voices in the creation science movement was Henry Morris. In an article published in the American Biology Teacher, he set out the differences, from his point of view, between the creation model and the evolution model. Essentially the creationists \\"theorized\\" that all living things were brought about by the acts of a Creator. The evolutionary model proposed that all living things were brought about by naturalistic processes due to properties inherent in inanimate matter. The creationists, in their literature, set the creation model alongside the evolutionary model, and insisted that good science education would provide alternative views on the same topic, and let the students evaluate them to form their own position. In 1969, the California State Advisory Committee on Science Education, appointed by the California State Board of Education, compiled and presented a set of recommendations and proposed curriculum guidelines for public school science courses. This report was entitled \\"The Science Framework for California Schools\\". The Science Framework on Science for California Schools sets forth the guidelines for the adoption of science textbooks (currently over $40 million are spent on science books in California during the science adoption year). Grose wrote and presented a document arguing that evolutionary theory was biased and should be taught only if alternative views were presented. He convinced the board of education to modify its position on the teaching of evolution. The Board modified the Science Framework on Science for California Schools so that the theory of creation would be included in textbooks. The board inserted the following statement into the framework: The \\"evolutionists were incredulous that creationists could have any influence.\\" A number of individuals and groups such as National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT), the National Academy of Science, and the Academic Senate of the University of California protested and lobbied against the state board's ruling. The solution to the creation - evolution issue resulted only after the state board had received numerous complaints about the earlier decision. In 1972 the California Board of Education decided to approve a statement prepared by its curriculum committee by proposing neutrality in science textbooks. Dogmatic statements in science books would be removed, and replaced with conditional statements. Textbooks dealing with evolution would have printed in them a statement indicating that science cannot answer all questions about origins, and that evolution is a theory, not a fact. Some textbooks, even in the 1990s, contain statements to this effect, usually printed on the inside cover. The effect of this policy change prevented textbook publishers from having to include in science books, a section on \\"creation science.\\" The board's decision, which was called the Antidogmatism Statement, caused publishers to rethink the way they were presenting science information in textbooks. Grose spoke before the California State Board of Education in 1969, addressing science guidelines for teaching science and evolution in the public school system, specifically in regards to teaching evolution as fact, while failing to consider or include other theories within the curriculum. In response to the encounter and resulting publicity, he established The Alpha Foundation, which serves families and the academic community by researching and publishing scientific materials in correlation with teaching creation as a scientific theory, alongside the teaching of evolution. As a result of the California State Board of Education's decision to incorporate alternative scientific theories within the student curriculum, other states throughout the US followed suit and revised their academic guidelines. In accordance with the Board's decision, the following content was added to the California Science Framework, affecting the teaching of science in K-12 classrooms in public schools throughout the US: > All scientific evidence to date concerning the origin of life implies at > least a dualism or the necessity to use several theories to fully explain > the relationships between established data points. This dualism is not > unique to this field of study, but is also appropriate in other scientific > disciplines such as the physics of light. While the Bible and other > philosophical treatises also mention creation, science has independently > postulated the various theories of creation. Therefore creation in > scientific terms is not a religious or philosophical belief. Also note that > creation and evolutionary theories are not necessarily mutual exclusives. > Some of the scientific data, for example the regular absence of transitional > forms, may be best explained by a creation theory, while other data, for > example transmutation of species, substantiate a process of evolution. In order to recoup its position as an active force in science education, the NSF prepared a report in 1980 entitled Science and Engineering Education for the 1980s and Beyond to the Carter administration. Unfortunately (for NSF) Carter was defeated, and the new president, Ronald Reagan rejected the reports recommendations, and tried to eliminate the science education section of NSF, and during the early 80s, the influence of NSF in science education was limited to college faculty improvement and graduate student fellowships in the basic sciences.

It was dismantled during the 1820s and replaced with New Altstadt Church. History The originally Roman Catholic parish church of Saint Nicholas was built in Altstadt south of K√∂nigsberg Castle in 1264 and then rebuilt from 1504 to 1537. The Antonine monk Johann Amandus began preaching a Protestant sermon at the church in 1523, but was expelled the following year for being an agitating iconoclast. Johannes Poliander became pastor in 1526 following the creation of the Duchy of Prussia and the parish's conversion to Lutheranism. Johann Funck served as pastor before becoming court preacher in 1549. Andreas Osiander was interred at the church in 1552, as was Hans Luther, Saxon privy councilor and son of Martin Luther, in 1575. Paul Siefert was organist at the church in 1611. Because of the growing size of Altstadt's parish, Neurossgarten Church was constructed in the 1640s to the northwest. Georg Riedel was a cantor at the church from 1709 to 1738. A new organ was designed for the Altstadt Church by Adam Gottlob Casparini in 1763. The church's nearby square, Altst√§dtischer Kirchenplatz, was developed in 1803. Because the church had begun to sink and crack, it was dismantled from 1826 to 1828. The last sermon was held there in 1824, with services temporarily moved to Neurossgarten Church. The replacement New Altstadt Church built northwest of the castle was dedicated in 1845. Its pulpit, choir, and altar were transferred from or based on its predecessor. After the dismantling of the original church, the parish converted the Altst√§dtischer Kirchenplatz into an enclosed garden; the developing square was renamed Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz in 1897.

This, Tyler's seventh novel, followed Celestial Navigation and Searching for Caleb and preceded her award-winning novels Morgan's Passing, Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist, and Breathing Lessons. Plot Thirty-five-year-old Charlotte Emory has felt trapped her whole life in Clarion, Maryland‚Äîfirst by her embarrassingly eccentric parents, then by her preacher-husband whom she married too young, and eventually by \\"his variously afflicted brothers, a daughter who won't answer to her own name, a house full of refugees, an impossible clutter.\\"Leonard, John (May 3, 1977) \\"Earthly Possessions,\\" New York Times She finally decides to run away from it all, rid herself of her \\"earthly possessions,\\" and start over. When she goes to the bank to withdraw funds for her escape, she gets taken hostage during a holdup. Prison escapee Jake Simms forces Charlotte into a stolen car and they head for Florida. \\"Earthly Possessions‚Ä¶contains a chilling portrait of a habitual criminal, Jake Simms, Jr., who blames every destructive and chaotic act of his own on someone else. He kidnaps our heroine, the surpassingly amiable Charlotte Emory because while he was robbing a bank a bystander happened to produce a gun. ‚ÄúI could be clean free,‚Äù he tells his victim, ‚Äúand you safe home with your kids by now if it wasn‚Äôt for him. Guy like that ought to be locked up.‚Äù As the chase continues, and the kidnapping lengthens into a kind of marriage, he persuades himself, ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt me keeping you it‚Äôs them. If they would quit hounding me then we could go our separate ways‚Ä¶‚Äù This is perfect loser psychology, the mental technology of digging a bottomless pit; but Anne Tyler would have us believe that Jake is saved from falling in by the doll-like apparition of a wee seventeen-year-old girl he has impregnated, Mindy Callender.‚ÄùUpdike, John, (June 6, 1977) \\"Loosened Roots,\\" New Yorker, pp. 130-134. Jake Simms‚Äô mission‚Äîbesides avoiding arrest‚Äîis to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù Mindy from a ‚Äúhome for wayward girls‚Äù where she is preparing to have his child. If Mindy is the essence of pure innocence, then Charlotte Emory is the earthbound mooring for this homeless couple‚Äîat least for a time. One irony here is that, when she was taken hostage, Charlotte herself was in the process of withdrawing her savings to run away from her own family and home. This is not the first time Charlotte has intended to run away, with no real plan or expectations. Charlotte has escaped one trap to find herself in another, but perhaps this \\"adventure\\" will provide her a new perspective. Reviews In 1977, John Leonard wrote, \\"That part of Earthly Possessions spent on the road--gas stations and junk food-- amounts to a Rabbit, Run without the Updike epiphanies. The rest is skillful flashback....I admit not being entirely sympathetic to the wry fatalism she proposes, to the notion that we travel enough in our heads to make leaving home almost redundant. Celestial Navigation (1974) and Searching for Caleb (1976) were more satisfying novels. But a taste of Anne Tyler, once acquired, is a splendid addiction.\\" John Updike reviewed the novel in The New Yorker: \\"Anne Tyler, in her seventh novel, 'Earthly Possessions', continues to demonstrate a remarkable talent and, for a writer of her acuity, an unusual temperament....Small towns and pinched minds hold room enough for her; she is at peace in the semi-countrified, semi-plasticized northern-Southern America where she and her characters live. Out of this peace flow her unmistakable strengths‚Äîserene firm tone; her smoothly spun plots; her apparently inexhaustible access to the personalities of her imagining; her infectious delight in ‚Äúthe smell of beautiful, everyday life‚Äù; her lack of any trace of intellectual or political condescension‚Äîand her one possible weakness: a tendency to leave the reader just where she found him....Charlotte Emory...belongs to what is becoming a familiar class of Anne Tyler heroines: women admirably active in the details of living yet alarmingly passive in the large curve of their lives‚Äîriders on male-generated events, who nevertheless give those events a certain blessing, a certain feasibility.\\" Adaptation for TV * Earthly Possessions (TV) (1999) stars Susan Sarandon, Stephen Dorff, and Elisabeth Moss. \\"The eventual romance [between Jake and Charlotte is] an element invented for the movie. [It] doesn‚Äôt disrupt the original sentiment of the story, but could easily have been left out without compromising the emotional development of the characters.\\" Fries, Laura (March 17, 1999), \\"Review: Earthly Possessions,\\"Variety.

It opened in November 2012 and is operated by Spire Healthcare, the second largest provider of private healthcare in the United Kingdom. The hospital is located in a large and \\"distinctive Edwardian commercial building\\" designed by prolific local architects Clayton & Black between 1899 and 1904. Originally built for local department store Hanningtons as a furniture depository, the \\"magnificent red-brick building\\" was converted into offices for the Legal & General insurance company in 1972. Six years after that firm moved to a new site in Hove, Spire Healthcare bought the empty building and spent ¬£25 million converting it into a hospital. History of the building The building (pictured in 2007) was put up for sale in 2005 after Legal & General moved out. Refurbishment took place in 2011‚Äì12. Hanningtons, Brighton's oldest and most famous department store, was opened in a single shop unit in the town's North Street in 1808. By the end of the 19th century it had expanded substantially and had floated on the stock market. More buildings were acquired throughout the town as the business grew, and by the 1860s Charles Smith Hannington (who had inherited the business from his father) had established a furniture storage and removals division for the benefit of people moving to the many villas and large houses built in Brighton and neighbouring Hove in that era. As this sideline expanded to cover removals from all parts of Britain, larger premises were needed. In 1898, Hanningtons found a suitable site in Hove, then a smaller town adjoining Brighton to the west, and commissioned architects Clayton & Black to draw up a plan for a furniture depository. Clayton & Black (Charles E. Clayton, Ernest Black and their sons and various partners) were a prolific local firm who at the time were also based in North Street, Brighton. Their commissions there included extensions to the Brighton Friends Meeting House and the Theatre Royal, but much of their early work was in Hove, where they designed residential buildings including Gwydyr Mansions and most of the Vallance Estate. The \\"imposing site\\" chosen by Hanningtons was at the junction of Davigdor and Montefiore Roads, near the Brighton boundary. On 16 March 1899, Hove Council gave their approval to the proposal; but work was delayed for more than two years until the land could be bought from the estate of the Goldsmid family. This transaction was completed on 11 November 1901 at a cost of ¬£3,750 (¬£ as of )). Work on the depository continued until 1904. Clayton & Black were again commissioned to extend the premises in 1915 and 1925; the latter work consisted of a workshop and stables, which were added to the northeast (Montefiore Road) side. Hanningtons occupied the building until 1972, when it was sold to the Legal & General Assurance Society. Architects Devereux and Partners undertook an \\"elegant\\" conversion of the premises on behalf of the insurance firm, including reglazing the windows while restoring their arched surrounds to their original condition. In its new form, it was the earliest in a succession of large office buildings on the north side of Davigdor Road. Legal & General occupied the building until 2005, when the new City Park office development next to Hove Park was completed and the company moved its offices there. The Davigdor Road building was bought by the Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, an asset management company, and stood empty for six years. In early 2011, it was stated that Spire Healthcare‚Äîa major operator of private hospitals in Britain‚Äîhad acquired the building and would spend ¬£25 million converting it into a hospital. Construction was expected to take 15 months. Renovations, which involved preserving the exterior features while removing all the old interior fittings and installing facilities such as operating theatres and consultation rooms, were carried out by Nightingale Architects with oversight from the hospital's director. The work received a \\"Best Refurbishment\\" award in the Acumen Commercial Property Awards held in Brighton in April 2012, at which the achievement of a \\"very good\\" BREEAM energy efficiency rating was noted. As well as Nightingale, a local firm, other companies involved with the project were A.F. Pilbeam and Mansell Construction (building work) and EMC Management Consultants (project management). When the project was announced, a summer 2012 opening date was anticipated, and Spire Healthcare later announced 29 October 2012 as the first day of operation, but The Montefiore Hospital eventually opened in November of that year. The name of the hospital comes from the philanthropist Sir Moses Montefiore. Hospital facilities Private facilities established at The Montefiore Hospital since it opened include the Sussex IBS Clinic, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, and the Spring Orthopaedic Centre. Consultations and treatments are offered for many other conditions and specialisms, such as dermatology, gynaecology, rheumatology and cosmetic surgery. In September 2012, an MRI scanner was installed at a cost of ¬£1 million. There are three operating theatres, 21 private en-suite bedrooms and facilities for outpatient treatment.

Their work encompassed a great variety of architectural styles and a wide range of building types‚Äîalthough they specialised in commercial buildings. They provided for Hanningtons \\"a magnificent red-brick building embellished with white stone and fine arched windows\\". Situated on an \\"imposing\\" corner site, it was given further prominence with a \\"handsome\\" corner dome. The Davigdor Road (south) and Montefiore Road (east) elevations were and long respectively, and there was of storage space inside, spread over five floors. These were stepped upwards from south to north because of the slope of the land, and load-bearing walls divided the interior into six sections. This meant the building was not well suited to the open-plan layout preferred in modern offices: \\"little interest\\" was shown by prospective commercial buyers during the years it was on the market.

The plot concerns the experiences of an advertising executive and a lawyer in Sedona, Arizona. Released theatrically in 2012, the film's cast includes Frances Fisher, Seth Peterson, Barry Corbin, Christopher Atkins, Lin Shaye, and Beth Grant. Plot The film contains two stories that take place in Sedona, Arizona. One story involves a successful advertising executive named Tammy (Frances Fisher) who, on her birthday, is driving from Portland to Phoenix to land the biggest client of her career until a wrong turn gets her lost and takes her into Sedona by mistake, where she is run off the highway by a tour plane making an emergency landing and right in the middle of town, and so she is forced to wait in Sedona while her damaged car is being repaired. Across town, a lawyer named Scott (Seth Peterson) is hiking in the woods with his partner Eddie (Matt Williamson) and their two young sons. Eddie brought the workaholic Scott to Sedona for some rest and relaxation, but wind up in an unexpected adventure when 7-year-old Denny (Trevor Sterling Stovall) gets lost. The ensuing frantic search for Denny sends Scott into a profound life- changing journey that forces him to examine his own priorities and determine what's truly important in his life. Meanwhile, Tammy unwittingly begins a spiritual transformation of her own as she encounters an array of the townspeople, each of them touching her in different meaningful ways. A chain of coincidences spirals her out of control, leaving her haunted by her past and forcing her to face her demons head on. Letting her guard down, she confronts the implausible possibility that she has been brought to Sedona for a reason.

He has published several books, most recently The Business of American Theatre (Oxford, UK: Routledge, 2020). He is also the author of numerous book chapters, articles in scholarly journals, reviews of both books and productions, and has presented dozens of papers at scholarly conferences both in the United States and abroad. Biography William Grange was born in Cincinnati and attended Thomas A. DeVilbiss High School in Toledo. During 1964 and 1965, DeVilbiss High School won two state titles and 1965 senior class president Randy Wertz nearly captured the state championship in tennis. The state championships awarded to DeVilbiss were in high school radio announcing (sponsored by Ohio State University) and in competitive patriotic speech (sponsored by the Sons of the American Revolution). Grange won the state championship in both contests. Theatrical career William Grange performed with the Light Opera of Manhattan and the Public Theater in New York while still attending Columbia University. He later acted with the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, TheatreWorks USA (New York), National Theatre Company (New York), Mark I Dinner Theatre (Florida), Haymarket Theatre Lincoln, and Nebraska Repertory Theatre. He has been a member of Actors' Equity Association since 1972.Actors' Equity Association Academic career Grange graduated in 1970 from the University of ToledoLC Authority File with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1972 he received a Master of Fine Arts degree from Columbia University in New York City, with a thesis titled \\"The Role of Tusenbach in Chekhov's 'The Three Sisters.'\\" WorldCat He received a doctorate from Indiana University in 1981 with a dissertation titled \\"The Collaboration of Carl Zuckmayer and Heinz Hilpert.\\". WorldCat Florida Southern College At Florida Southern College, a small liberal arts institution in Lakeland, Florida and affiliated with the United Methodist Church, Grange chaired the Department of Theatre Arts and taught both academic and performance courses. He encountered difficulties with College officials when he staged the musicals Cabaret and Grease, because some considered the shows too racy for a Methodist institution. His productions of Shakespearean comedies and dramas by Henrik Ibsen, along with the Humperdinck opera Hansel and Gretel with mezzo-soprano Beverly Wolff met with approval. College administrators were nevertheless pleased when he left Florida Southern to accept a position at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Marquette University Grange chaired the Performing Arts Department and directed numerous musicals at Marquette University, a Roman Catholic institution in Milwaukee, Wisconsin affiliated with the Jesuit Order. Among them were Happy End and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. He also directed new translations of dramas by Bertolt Brecht. He ran afoul of numerous Roman Catholic strictures at the Jesuit institution, though he published two books and several articles, and won fellowships from the German government and the National Endowment for the Humanities with full support from the Jesuit fathers. Other Roman Catholics, however, were glad when he departed in 1996 for the University of Nebraska. University of Nebraska At the University of Nebraska since 1996, Grange has published several books, scholarly articles, and received numerous international awards for his scholarship and teaching, including three Fulbrights and five fellowships from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (German Academic Exchange Service). The Actors' Fund of America cited Grange in 2014 with its \\"Encore Award\\" for his \\"contributions to the acting profession.\\" He has also received university awards from parents of Nebraska students. In the University's Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Emerging Media, he has taught mostly academic courses in theatre history, script analysis, film technology, and seminars on various film actors and genres. While serving as Chairman of the Graduate Committee in the Johnny Carson School, his colleagues elected him their representative to the Faculty Senate for several three-year terms. After terms in the Faculty Senate, he has served as a consultant for several European publication and institutional boards. Honors In 2010, Grange was Guest Professor at the University of Heidelberg; in 2007, he held the Fulbright Distinguished Chair in Humanities and Cultural Studies at the University of Vienna, teaching in German. He also taught in German during 2000-2001 as Fulbright Guest Professor at the University of Cologne. He has received five research fellowships from the German Academic Exchange Service; the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center; the National Endowment for the Humanities; the Dorot Foundation in Providence, Rhode Island; the Mellon Foundation, the International Institute of Education, the Hixson-Lied Trust Endowment, and the Jane Harrison Lyman Research Trust Fund.

The think tank is registered as a non-stock corporation in Washington, DC, and located in Arlington, Virginia, U.S.A. Founded in 1984, CESJ studies, promotes and develops programs embodying a free enterprise approach to global economic justice through expanded capital ownership. CESJ calls its approach ‚Äúthe Just Third Way.‚Äù The organization describes itself as politically and religiously pluralistic. Mission and Philosophy CESJ's stated mission is to ‚Äúdevelop and disseminate a strategy and series of approaches by which people can understand and practice the moral values, central principles and logic behind a free enterprise theory of economic and social justice.‚Äù Its approach is based on a synthesis of the social doctrine of Pope Pius XI as analyzed by CESJ co-founder the late Reverend William J. Ferree, S.M., Ph.D., detailed in The Act of Social Justice (1943)Ferree, Rev. William J., The Act of Social Justice. Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 1943. and Introduction to Social Justice (1948),Ferree, Rev. William J., Introduction to Social Justice. New York: Paulist Press, 1948. and the economic justice principles developed by lawyer- economist Louis O. Kelso and Aristotelian philosopher Mortimer J. Adler in their two books, The Capitalist Manifesto (1958)Adler, Mortimer J., and Kelso, Louis O., The Capitalist Manifesto. New York: Random House, 1958. and The New Capitalists (1961).Adler, Mortimer J., and Kelso, Louis O., The New Capitalists. New York: Random House, 1961. CESJ considers the subtitle of the latter ‚Äî ‚ÄúA Proposal to Free Economic Growth from the Slavery of Savings‚Äù ‚Äî to be particularly significant in its challenging of the fundamental assumption of Keynesian economics that the only way to finance new capital is to cut consumption and accumulate money savings.John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), II.6.ii. Many CESJ members and supporters do not agree that the terms ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù and ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù accurately describe the system Kelso and Adler framed. Karl Marx and the socialists, they claim, invented these terms to condemn what they saw as the inherent greed, exploitation, and injustices inherent in a system where the powers and profits of land and productive assets became concentrated within a tiny elite of private owners. To remedy the abuses of concentrated capital ownership, Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto (1848) declared, ‚Äú[T]he theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: the abolition of private property.‚ÄùMarx, Karl, and Engels, Friedrich, The Communist Manifesto. London: Penguin Books, 1967, 96. In contrast, Kelso turned the socialist's central assumption around by asserting that private property, far from being the problem, is essential for creating a truly just free market global economy. An economically just economy is one in which every citizen can be a capital owner without taking property away from the currently wealthy (whom the system allowed to monopolize ownership of increasingly productive labor displacing-technologies). CESJ defines ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù as a system in which proprietary rights to profits and control over capital assets is concentrated in a small private elite, and ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù as a system in which capital ownership or control is vested in the State. In both systems most people are dependent on wages and welfare for subsistence. CESJ prefers the term ‚ÄúJust Third Way‚Äù to describe the Kelsonian alternative. According to CESJ, the Just Third Way is a system based on equality in which capital is broadly owned instead of concentrated, and everyone has equality of opportunity to gain personal income from private property rights both from one's human (or labor) contributions and one's non-human (or capital) contributions to the productive process. CESJ bases its policies and programs on respect for human dignity and ‚Äúsovereignty of the person.‚ÄùCESJ Core Values, http://www.cesj.org/about/corevalues.htm , accessed November 14, 2012. This is realized through empowering every individual economically and politically with non-coercive means to acquire direct ownership of capital. Citing the example of leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), CESJ points out how capital can be and has been acquired by new owners through personal access to capital credit designed to be repayable with the future earnings of the capital itself. Access to such credit and other non-redistributive social means can be universalized by reforming specific institutions of society (see the section below under ‚ÄúCapital Homesteading‚Äù). The Principles of Economic Justice CESJ describes its policies and programs are applications of the three principles of economic justice Kelso and Adler explained in Chapter 5 of The Capitalist Manifesto: :‚Ä¢ Participation. ‚ÄúParticipation‚Äù or ‚Äúparticipative justice‚Äù is the input principle that promotes the fundamental human right of every person to equal opportunity to live in a system that promotes their dignity and access to social means for empowering them to contribute their labor as well as their capital, to the production of marketable goods and services. : :‚Ä¢ Distribution. ‚ÄúDistribution‚Äù or ‚Äúdistributive justice‚Äù is the out-take principle ‚Äî based on the exchange value of one‚Äôs economic contributions ‚Äî that all people have a right to receive a proportionate, market-determined share of the value of the marketable goods and services they produce with their labor, their capital, or both. : :‚Ä¢ Harmony (Limitation/Social Justice). ‚ÄúHarmony‚Äù or ‚ÄúSocial Justice‚Äù is the feedback principle that balances ‚Äúparticipative justice‚Äù and ‚Äúdistributive justice‚Äù when either essential principle is missing or is violated by the system. Kelso and Adler referred to this principle as the ‚Äúprinciple of limitation,‚Äù arguing that, since everyone has a right to own capital, no one should own so much as to inhibit or prevent others from owning.Kelso and Adler, The Capitalist Manifesto, op. cit., 68. Norman G. Kurland and Dawn K. Brohawn of the Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ) argue that, since economic justice is a subset of social justice, there should (consistent with the principle of participationibid. be less emphasis on class warfare politics based on redistributing wealth of all persons favored by the current system, and more emphasis on reforming economic institutions to ensure equality of opportunity to acquire capital.Kurland, Norman G. and Brohawn, Dawn K., ‚ÄúKelso‚Äôs Vision for the 21st Century,‚Äù Owners at Work, Winter 1999/2000. History Alexandria Tire Company (Egypt) In 1990, Norman G. Kurland, CESJ's president, headed the team that implemented the world's first ESOP (called a ‚ÄúWorkers Shareholders Association‚Äù under a new Egyptian law) in a developing country for the Alexandria Tire Company using funds provided by USAID. Writing to The Wall Street Journal, Melanie Tammen of the Competitive Enterprise Institute cited the Alexandria Tire Company as the sole worthy achievement in USAID's record of aid to Egypt.Melanie Tammen, ‚ÄúInept Aid to Egypt,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal, 01/24/89, A21. Capital Homesteading In 1982 Norman G. Kurland (later president of CESJ) wrote a concept paper on the ‚ÄúCapital Homestead Act‚Äù at the request of Dr. Norman Bailey, then-Chief Economist for International Affairs of the National Security Council. Conceived as a ‚ÄúNew Marshall Plan‚Äù for stimulating rapid, non-inflationary growth, the proposal contained Federal Reserve, tax and other expanded capital ownership reforms intended to enable each citizen to accumulate a ‚Äúcapital homestead‚Äù of income- generating assets sufficient to meet ordinary living expenses, and reduce over time the growing costs of unsustainable Federal entitlement spending. The Capital Homesteading concept was an expansion of the ‚ÄúSecond Income Plan‚Äù (later called ‚ÄúThe Industrial Homestead Act‚Äù) developed by Louis O. Kelso and Walter Lawrence in 1965. Referring to Kelso's ideas, then-Governor Ronald Reagan declared in 1974 that ‚ÄúLincoln signed the Homestead Act. . . . We need an Industrial Homestead Act.‚ÄùSpeech in July 1974 at the Bohemian Grove encampment, and to the Young Americans for Freedom meeting in San Francisco, California. The Kelso Plan to make every citizen an owner was renamed the ‚ÄúCapital Homestead Act‚Äù in CESJ's Capital Homesteading for Every Citizen (2004).Cf. McClaughry, John M., ‚ÄúRonald Reagan‚Äôs Vision of a Human-Scale Future,‚Äù The Futurist, December 1981. :‚Ä¢ In 1992 Kurland was invited by then-U.S. Democratic Congressman and Majority Whip-at-Large Mike Espy (later appointed Secretary of Agriculture by President Clinton) to speak on a panel workshop of the Congressional Black Caucus. C-Span televised the presentation of the Capital Homestead agenda.Congressional Black Caucus, ‚ÄúPolitics of Diversity,‚Äù C-Span2, September 24, 1992. At the invitation of Secretary of Agriculture Espy, CESJ representatives participated in the 1994 Senior Policy Retreat for 75 top-level USDA officials. Norman Kurland served as a ‚Äúchallenge speaker,‚Äù and delivered a white paper on a new expanded ownership thrust for U.S. agricultural and rural development policy. : :‚Ä¢ In February 2001 CESJ received a grant from the William H. Donner Foundation to develop an expanded ownership strategy to address the crisis in the U.S. Social Security system. The report was released in December 2002. : :‚Ä¢ On January 1, 2004, CESJ published an expanded version of the strategy paper under the title Capital Homesteading for Every Citizen: A Just Free Market Solution for Saving Social Security.

Publications Beginning with the 1986 orientation book for the Presidential Task Force on Project Economic Justice (below), Every Worker an Owner, and the Task Force Report, High Road to Economic Justice, CESJ has published books on public policy and monetary and tax reform, as well as compendia of previously published articles. Curing World Poverty: The New Role of Property (1994) was published in a joint venture with the Central Bureau of the Catholic Central Union of America in St. Louis under the ‚ÄúSocial Justice Review‚Äù imprint. Capital Homesteading for Every Citizen: A Just Free Market Solution for Saving Social Security (2004), a ‚Äúpolicy manual for change,‚Äù was published under CESJ's ‚ÄúEconomic Justice Media‚Äù imprint. With the 2012 publication of The Restoration of Property: A Reexamination of a Natural Right, CESJ began a series of ‚ÄúParadigm Papers‚Äù to address specific issues. CESJ has also published three titles in its ‚ÄúEconomic Justice Classics‚Äù series: annotated editions of William Cobbett's The Emigrant‚Äôs Guide (1829), William Thomas Thornton's A Plea for Peasant Proprietors (1848, 1873) and Harold G. Moulton's The Formation of Capital (1935). Political Stance CESJ has no official political stance, being multi-partisan in its outreach. Its members come from every political affiliation from ultra-liberal to arch-conservative, and belong to both major parties and a number of third parties. The ‚ÄúAmerican Revolutionary Party‚Äùhttp://www.amercianrevolutionaryparty.us/ has adopted CESJ's ‚ÄúJust Third Way‚Äù as part of its platform. In 2011 members of CESJ formed the Coalition for Capital Homesteading to advocate the passage of a Capital Homestead Act.http://www.capitalhomestead.org/ References Bibliography Adler, Mortimer J., and Kelso, Louis O., The Capitalist Manifesto.

It was built as a replacement for the dismantled medieval Altstadt Church. History The original Altstadt Church, which dated from 1264 and was located south of K√∂nigsberg Castle, was dismantled from 1826 to 1828 because of cracks and sinking. Services were temporarily moved to Neurossgarten Church. The replacement church's site was chosen as the intersection of Kreytzenscher Platz and Junkerstra√üe north of the castle. Construction began in 1838 based on plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Although the original design had to be reduced in scale because of cost, the Brick Neo-Gothic church was praised for its columns. The New Altstadt Church was dedicated in 1845, with its pulpit, choir, and altar transferred from or based on its predecessor. A highlight of the church was its 13 m tall high altar. It included a wooden carving from 1606 by an unknown master of the crucifixion of Jesus, John the Apostle, Mary of Nazareth, Mary Magdalene, and the thieves Dismas and Gesmas. The carving was moved to a massive barn near Arnau in 1943, but was subsequently lost during World War II. Also notable was a deer chandelier with Mother and Child from c. 1500. Its confessional was designed by Isaak Riga the Younger. The church was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and was not rebuilt by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad after the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. The remnants of the outer walls were dismantled in 1959 and columns from its portico are included in the entrance of Kaliningrad's Baltika Stadium.

Grave Robbery NoteTitle seen on manhua edition of the story. and The Lost Tomb,Title seen on serial edition of the story. is a novel series about the grave-robbing adventures of Wu Xie, a young man hailing from a family that had been tomb-raiders for centuries. Written by Xu Lei () who is better known by his pen-name Nan Pai San Shu (). It was first serialized online at Qidian China (), a Chinese website for publishing, writing and reading novels. Written over a span of five years and published as nine separate novels, it is one of the most popular novel series in China from 2007 with several million fans and over 20 million copies sold. The author has also written two sequels, Zang Hai Hua () and Sha Hai () which continued the leading character's story, neither of which were finished at the time of the author's announcement to retire from writing on March 22, 2013. Along with Ghost Blows Out the Light, Daomu has contributed greatly to creating a craze and subsequent market in the Greater China area for novels focusing on grave- robbing that also deal with the supernatural. Plot 50 years ago, a group of Changsha grave robbers dug out manuscripts of the location of treasures from Warring states, but an encounter with an undead rendered almost the whole group dead. In the present, the young grandchild of the sole survivor, Wu Xie, discovers a secret within his grandfather's notes. Together with his third uncle, Wu Sanxing, and a few other experienced tomb robbers, to search for the treasure. But what no one expected to find the intriguing mysteries that accompanied their tomb robbing adventure - just who was the owner of that tomb? Will they be able to find the real coffin? And just where will these puzzle lead the group? Embarking on eight-volume's worth of adventures, as Wu Xie slowly unravels millennium-old mysteries, he sees the deterioration of his naive world as he discovers the people around him are not what they seem and that he could trust no one in this tomb robbing world of deceit and lies. Main characters Wu Xie (): The point-of-view character and primary protagonist. He is from the Hangzhou Wu family, one of the Changsha Old Nine, a group of families who have been grave-robbing for centuries. At the beginning of the first book he joins his uncle Wu Sanxing to experience grave- robbing for the first time, setting off the series of events to come in later books. His name is a homophone with \\"innocent\\" (ÁÑ°ÈÇ™, also pronounced \\"Wu Xie\\"), indicating his gullible nature. Zhang Kylin (): A man with a mysterious past whose story leads the last few volumes of the chronicles. He is often hired as an assistant to many grave-robbing endeavors and is highly competent at it; very little is known about him, even his real name. \\"Fatty\\" Wang (): Nicknamed \\"Gold Getting Xiao Wei\\", he is a northern grave-robber (as opposed to Wu Xie, from the south) and teams up with both Wu Xie and Zhang Kylin throughout the books; together they are referred to as the \\"Iron Triangle.\\" Wu Sanxing (): Wu Xie's third uncle. An experienced grave-robber with a few well-kept secrets. Pan Zi (): Sansheng's right-hand man, who had served in the Sino-Vietnamese War prior to becoming a grave-robber. A'ning (): A grave-robber and the first major female introduced in the series, her motives are unclear but she seems to be working against the protagonists. Yun Cai: A Yao girl who helps Fat Wang and Wu Xie during their adventures in Yunnan. Adaptations In 2011, a serialized manhua, drawn by Dongdong and Yuelu, was published. After the fifth volume, the author of Daomu Biji had an argument with Dongdong and Yuelu. This, unfortunately ended the manhua series. There is also an American serialized graphic novel.

Career After beginning his career with Udoji United, Ofodile first came to Europe with the Belgian club Eendracht Aalst. After spending two years on loan with German amateur club SC Kapellen- Erft, he signed for 1. FC Magdeburg of the Regionalliga Nordost in 1999. Magdeburg finished 10th in Ofodile's first season with the club, which, due to a restructuring of the Regionalliga, meant relegation to the fourth tier NOFV- Oberliga S√ºd. Magdeburg had a hugely successful 2000‚Äì01 at this level - with a frontline including Ofodile, Josef Ivanovic, David Mydlo and Vlado Papic, they won the title, and promotion, scoring 120 goals, and had a memorable cup run, beating 1. FC K√∂ln, Bayern Munich (who would go on to be European champions) and Karlsruher SC before losing in the quarter-finals to eventual winners FC Schalke 04. Ofodile left Magdeburg in the summer of 2001, moving to England to sign for First Division side Walsall. After a disappointing year, in which he only made one league appearance, as a late substitute for Darren Byfield in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Crystal Palace, and one in the Football League Cup, he returned to Germany to sign for FC St. Pauli of the 2. Bundesliga. Ofodile scored twice on his debut for St. Pauli, after coming on for Tobias Kurbjuweit in a 7‚Äì1 over Eintracht Braunschweig, but only made ten further appearances, all in the first half of the season, without getting on the scoresheet, and left the club in July 2003. He spent two years with Hallescher FC and one with Gr√ºn-Wei√ü Piesteritz before returning to Nigeria. In 2012, he returned to Germany for a brief spell with SC Herford of the seventh tier Landesliga Westfalen.

He was also a theologian, an author, an internationally known iconographer and an expert in the design of church furnishings. He was the inspiration for Canon Tallis in Madeleine L'Engle's young adult novels and was Madeleine's spiritual mentor. He was a graduate of Boston University and the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church. He was an Officer of the Order of the British Empire; an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau; a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor; and a Knight Commander of the Royal Order of St. Sava. Early life and education West was born in Boston and graduated from Boston University in 1931. After graduating from the General Theological Seminary he was ordained a deacon in 1934 and was ordained a priest in 1935. Career He served as curate and then rector of Trinity Church in Ossining, New York, from 1934 to 1941 and was then named the Sacrist at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. He was named Canon Sacrist in 1943 and Sub Dean of the cathedral in 1966. As Sub Dean, he was responsible for cathedral life when the Dean was absent or, as was often the case, when the position was unfilled. He retired in 1981 as Canon Sacrist. Authority on Liturgical Art He was also an authority on liturgical art and designed and painted the iconostasis, or altar screens, of the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava in Manhattan. He also created the official emblem of the worldwide Anglican Communion, designed the coat of arms for the Diocese of Albany, as well as Episcopal rings, stained glass windows, altar frontals, processional crosses and religious vestments. Spiritual influence and Practice Canon West was a high church Episcopalian attuned to both Anglican and Eastern Orthodox culture and practice. He was a huge fan of writer Fyodor Dostoevsky and was especially fond of, and fashioned his mission akin to the character Father Zossima in the Brother's Karamazof (a starets, or Christian guru without high political ranking but the go-to person for advice among the people in his community.) Role in assisting Jewish refugees in World War II Canon West assisted with the resettlement of Jewish refugees in World War II. For his services and those of the Cathedral of St. John as a whole, the Cathedral was given two giant menorahs by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the New York Times. These stand today before the Cathedral's high altar. Mentor to writer Madeleine L'Engle Canon West was a spiritual mentor and a literary adviser to writer Madeleine L'Engle. The two had a long and close relationship, always platonic, which carried with it both a formality and informality at the same time. Madeleine became the Cathedral's librarian and his office was adjacent to his, with a door that went from the library to his office. The two also shared a love of dogs, and together cared for Irish Setters. The two together also served as mentors to many of people who were part of the Cathedral community and otherwise References External links *Obituary from The New York Times *Bibliographic directory from Project Canterbury Category:1909 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Sava Category:Boston University alumni ","title":"Edward Nason West"},{"id":"37977466","text":"Pat Harrison Waterway District (PHWD) is a Mississippi State Agency with headquarters in Hattiesburg. The agency was created in 1962 with a directive of flood control in southeastern and east central Mississippi. History and mission Pat Harrison Waterway District Headquarters in Hattiesburg, MS When the Waterway District was created in 1962, its main mission was flood control for rivers and their tributaries along the Pascagoula River Basin in southeastern and east central Mississippi. In addition to flood control, the agency‚Äôs mission expanded to include water management and recreation. The District derives its name from Pat Harrison, who served Mississippi as U.S. Representative (1911‚Äì19) and Senator (1919-41). Funding Funding for PHWD comes from ad valorem taxes collected in member Counties, park recreation fees, timber sales, and interest from investments. PHWD is governed by an 18 member Board of Directors, with one Director appointed from each of the 15 member Counties and three Directors appointed by the Governor of Mississippi. Full-time employees are located at the central office in Hattiesburg and at the District‚Äôs eight water parks.

Early years Born in Budapest, Hungary, Teszler spent his early years in hospitals in Budapest being treated for club feet, but after several years of treatment, was able to enter school.Funeral Notice, Spartanburg Herald-Journal, July 26, 2000 Wofford College Press Release, July 24, 2000, Wofford College Archives After attending high school in Budapest, he studied textile engineering at the University of Chemnitz, in Germany. As a Jew, Teszler was unable to attend university in Hungary because the quota of Jewish students had already been filled.[Memoirs of Sandor Teszler, Chapter 1, https://www.wofford.edu/academics/library/archives-special- collections/college-archives/digital-archives/chapter-1-youth Early career Following his graduation from the University of Chemnitz, he joined his brother's textile company in Zagreb, Croatia in 1925. In 1929, the firm merged with another firm and moved to Cakovec, Croatia. The textile industry in Yugoslavia was almost nonexistent at this point, because most textile firms had been in the Czech part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By 1941, it had become a large, vertically-integrated firm, with spinning, dyeing, weaving, knitting, and apparel manufacturing.Memoirs of Sandor Teszler, Chapter 1, https://www.wofford.edu/academics/library/archives-special- collections/college-archives/digital-archives/chapter-1-youth World War II Following the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the area in which his factory was located came under Hungarian control. The factory continued to produce textile goods for the Hungarian government. For three years, the Teszler family, including his wife and two sons, was unharmed. When the German army occupied Hungary in 1944, the situation for Hungary's Jews deteriorated rapidly. The intervention of factory workers themselves kept the Teszler family from being deported, but resulted in their being virtually imprisoned on the factory grounds for six months. Later taken with his family back to Budapest, he was able to go into hiding, but in November, was taken to a death house. On the verge of committing suicide by taking cyanide tablets, they were saved by the intervention of the Swiss consul, who was responsible for Yugoslav citizens in Budapest.Memoirs of Sandor Teszler, Chapter 2, https://www.wofford.edu/academics/library/archives-special- collections/college-archives/digital-archives/chapter-2-productive-years- europe After they were liberated by the Soviets, the Teszlers tried to rebuild their lives. The Yugoslav government seized their factory, claiming they had collaborated with the Germans. Teszler was one of three experts in textiles who helped to rebuild Hungary's textile industry, but deteriorating conditions and the pending takeover of Hungary's government by Communists led him to leave for Great Britain, where his sons were in school. Years in America In January 1948, Teszler emigrated to New York City, where he began managing one of his brother's textile factories on Long Island. His sons followed, and both enrolled at North Carolina State University to study textiles and chemistry. In 1960, his son Andrew Teszler moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina to start the Butte Knitting Mill, and in 1961, Sandor Teszler sold his plant on Long Island and moved to Spartanburg. He started a textile factory in nearby Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and because of his experience with discrimination in Europe, he intentionally integrated his plant. In 1965, he sold his plant to Reeves Brothers and began working with Andrew Teszler in Spartanburg.Memoirs of Sandor Teszler, Chapter 3, https://www.wofford.edu/academics/library/archives-special- collections/college-archives/digital-archives/chapter-3-productive-years- america In 1971, Andrew Teszler, a member of the Wofford College Board of Trustees, contributed funds to Wofford in honor of his father, and the college's new library, opened in 1969, was named the Sandor Teszler Library in his honor. In that same year, Andrew Teszler left Butte Knitting and started a new company, called the Olympia Mill, and after his sudden death in May 1971, Sandor Teszler became chairman of that company. He continued to work there until his retirement in 1979, after Monsanto had taken ownership. Retirement and legacy In retirement, Sandor Teszler traveled and audited courses at Wofford College. After the death of his wife of 54 years, Lidia, in 1981 and the death of his son Otto in 1990, he became a fixture on the Wofford campus, attending courses and reading books in the library that bears his name.Memoirs of Sandor Teszler, Chapter 4, https://www.wofford.edu/academics/library/archives-special- collections/college-archives/digital-archives/chapter-4-retirement In those years, he audited over fifty classes at the college, particularly ones in the humanities, art history, philosophy, and history. Students took to calling him \\"Opi,\\" a Hungarian word for grandfather. The college awarded him an honorary doctor of humanities degree in 1987.Sandor Teszler: History in the Flesh, Spartanburg Herald-Journal, July 7, 1997 In 1996, when he was 93 years old, the faculty of the college voted to make him a professor in the humanities.

It performs primarily with Western instruments, sometimes performing alongside traditional Korean soloists. The orchestra has a concert hall, the Unhasu Theater in Pyongyang, dedicated for its use. Ri Sol-ju, the wife of Kim Jong-un, was a singer in this group. Performances On 14 March 2012, the South Korean conductor Myung-whun Chung led the combined orchestras of Unhasu Orchestra and the Radio France Philharmonic in the Salle Pleyel concert hall in Paris, France. The pan-Korean folk song called \\"Arirang\\" was played. Rumored executions and alleged disbandment On August 29, 2013, The Chosun Ilbo reported, based on anonymous sources in China, that key members of the Moranbong Band and Unhasu Orchestra were made to watch the execution by firing squad of certain members of the Unhasu Orchestra, including violinist Mun Kyong-jin, members of the Wangjaesan Light Music Band, and the singer Hyon Song-wol (since seen alive on NK television in 2014), on the orders of Kim Jong-un. According to the Chosun Ilbo report, the Unhasu Orchestra was then disbanded. The executed members of the band have been named by the music journalist Norman Lebrecht as the concertmasters Moon, Gyeong-Jin, and Jung, Sun-Young. Other reporters are skeptical of The Chosun Ilbo report, such as Chad O'Carroll of NK News, a North Korean analyst website. O'Carroll told Business Insider, \\"You've got to remember that a lot of the time the source is South Korean and it's in their interest to distort or perhaps weave the truth every now and then.\\" John Delury from the Yonsei University in Seoul, told The Guardian, \\"This stuff gets planted regularly in media outlets and then quickly goes viral. There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true ‚Äì but a great deal of it is probably not.\\" Delury also added: \\"The normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'It's North Korea ‚Äì no one knows what's going on in there. Hyon Song-wol, the focus of many of the reports, was later shown to be alive and well. Alejandro Cao de Ben√≥s said that the news was false and the orchestra would perform on September 9, 2013. However, the orchestra were not present at the Day of the Foundation of the Republic celebrations on September 9, being replaced by the Korean People's Internal Security Forces Song and Dance Ensemble, leading to further speculation and concern about the fate of Unhasu Orchestra members. Nam Jae-joon, the chief of the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), said, on 8 October 2013, he was aware that \\"about 10 members of the Unhasu Orchestra were executed for involvement in the scandal.\\" A performance by the orchestra was broadcast by North Korean radio in October 2013.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/17/north-korean- singer-rumoured-executed-appears-tv Rumors of executions resurfaced in 2015 when South Korean lawmaker Shin Kyung-min revealed NIS' findings on recent executions. According to NIS, four top members of the orchestra were executed in March 2015 for spying for South Korea. Among them was the unnamed director general of the orchestra who was identified as a \\"Russian-trained composer and producer in his late 60s who came from Japan's pro-North Korean community\\". According to one of NIS' sources, the four were stripped naked before they were executed with machine gun fire. The execution took place in Pyongyang and four to five hundred members of Pyongyang's artistic community were forced to witness it. The execution was described as unusual with respect to both its cruelty and the fact that the families of those who were executed were reportedly spared from repercussions.

Michael Doebel the Elder was the sculptor. Ludwig Ernst von Borowski, who later became a Protestant archbishop, served as the church's pastor beginning in 1782.

April 2010 Coast Guard and Mineral Management Services investigation  On 22 April 2010, the United States Coast Guard and the Minerals Management Service launched an investigation of the possible causes of the Deepwater Horizon explosion; they obtained and analyzed the blowout preventer, a crucial piece of evidence as to the cause of the explosion and spill. In a 23 December letter, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board asked the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (formerly called the Minerals Management Service) to discontinue its investigation of the blowout preventer, which began 16 November at a NASA facility near New Orleans, until dealing with conflicts of interest. The board said Transocean and Cameron International, maker of the blowout preventer, had more access than the board did, and that Det Norske Veritas, which led the testing, should be removed or monitored more closely. Transocean said the board's \\"accusations are totally unfounded.\\" On 8 December, Joe Keith, a senior Halliburton manager, said to the U.S. Coast Guard-Interior Department panel in Houston that he left his post aboard Transocean‚Äôs rig to smoke a cigarette on the night of the April disaster in the Gulf. While he was away from his monitors, charts entered into evidence showed that pressure data indicated the well was filling up with explosive natural gas and crude. Halliburton shares immediately fell on the New York Stock Exchange when news of his testimony emerged. On 23 March 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard published the forensic examination report prepared by U.S. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Columbus, the contractor that performed the examination. The report concluded that the primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe trapped between the shearing blocks. This happened because the drill pipe elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the drill pipe during loss of well control, consequently, drill pipe in process of shearing was deformed outside the shearing blade surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire pipe cross section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the drill pipe trapped between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.See page 5 of In September 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard published its final investigative report on the accident. In essence, that report states that the main cause was the defective cement job, and Halliburton, BP and Transocean were, in different ways, responsible for the accident. The report consists of two volumes. Volume I contains the report of the US Coast Guard. That volume states that, although the events leading to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout, the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies, and acts and omissions by Transocean and its Deepwater Horizon crew, that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster. These included poor maintenance of electrical equipment that may have ignited the explosion, bypassing of gas alarms and automatic shutdown systems that could prevent an explosion, and lack of training of personnel on when and how to shut down engines and disconnect the MODU from the well to avoid a gas explosion and mitigate the damage from an explosion and fire. These deficiencies indicate that Transocean‚Äôs failure to have an effective safety management system and instill a culture that emphasizes and ensures safety contributed to this disaster. This investigation also revealed that the oversight and regulation of Deepwater Horizon by its flag state, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), was ineffective in preventing this casualty. By delegating all of its inspection activities to ‚Äúrecognized organizations,‚Äù without itself conducting on board oversight surveys, the RMI effectively abdicated its vessel inspection responsibilities. Volume II of the report cited above contains the report of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). That volume states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of a cement barrier in the production casing string, a high‚Äêstrength steel pipe set in a well to ensure well integrity and to allow future production. The failure of the cement barrier allowed hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout. The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‚Äêminute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform. BP, as the designated operator under BOEMRE regulations, was ultimately responsible for conducting operations at Macondo in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment. Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon, was responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel on board. Halliburton, as a contractor to BP, was responsible for conducting the cement job, and, through its subsidiary (Sperry Sun), had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well. May 2010 National Academy of Engineering investigation  On 11 May the Obama administration requested the National Academy of Engineering conduct an independent technical investigation to determine the root causes of the disaster so that corrective steps could be taken to address the mechanical failures underlying the accident. On 16 November, the independent 15-member committee convened by the National Academy of Engineering released a report stating BP and others, including federal regulators, ignored \\"near misses\\". University of Michigan engineering practice professor and committee chairman Donald Winter said that sealing the well continued \\"despite several indications of potential hazard\\". For example, tests showed the cement was not strong enough to prevent oil and gas from escaping. Also, BP lost drilling materials in the hole. According to Donald Winter, the panel of investigators could not pin the explosion aboard the rig on a single decision made by BP, or anyone else, they found that the companies' focus on speed over safety, given that the well was behind schedule costing BP $1.5 million a day-helped lead to the accident. As Donald Winter told The New York Times, \\"A large number of decisions were made that were highly questionable and potentially contributed to the blowout of the Macondo well... Virtually all were made in favor of approaches which were shorter in time and lower in cost. That gives us concern that there was not proper consideration of the tradeoffs between cost and schedule and risk and safety.\\"On \\"Oil Spill: The National Academy of Engineers Spreads the Blame Around\\" ‚Äì by Brian Walsh ‚Äì Ecocentric ‚Äì 17 November 2010 ‚Äì Time Inc. An unused Oil Spill Commission slide obtained by Greenwire, outlines 11 decisions that BP and its contractors ( Halliburton Co., Transocean Ltd. and MI Swaco) made before the disaster that may have increased risk on the rig. At least nine of the decisions saved time, and the majority were made on shore, mainly by BP.\\"Missing Oil Spill Commission Document Shows BP Made Risky Decisions in Gulf to Save Time\\" ‚Äì by Katie Howell ‚Äì The New York Times ‚Äì 23 November 2010. May 2010 bipartisan National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling investigation  On 22 May President Obama announced that he had issued establishing the bipartisan National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, with former Florida Governor and Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly serving as co-chairs. The purpose of the commission was to \\"consider the root causes of the disaster and offer options on safety and environmental precautions.\\" On 8 November, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig. However, the panel said a day later that there had been \\"a rush to completion\\" on the well, criticizing poor management decisions. \\"There was not a culture of safety on that rig,\\" co-chair Bill Reilly said. One of the decisions met with tough questions was that BP refuted the findings of advanced modelling software that had ascertained over three times as many centralizers were needed on the rig. It also decided not to rerun the software when it stuck with only six centralizers, and ignored or misread warnings from other key tests, the panel said. On 5 January 2011, the White House oil spill commission released a final report detailing faults by the companies that led to the spill. The panel found that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean had attempted to work more cheaply and thus helped to trigger the explosion and ensuing leakage. The report states: \\"Whether purposeful or not, many of the decisions that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time (and money).\\" BP released a statement in response to this, saying, \\"Even prior to the conclusion of the commission‚Äôs investigation, BP instituted significant changes designed to further strengthen safety and risk management.\\" Transocean, however, blamed BP for making the decisions before the actual explosion occurred and government officials for permitting those decisions. Halliburton stated that it was acting only upon the orders of BP when it injected the cement into the wall of the well. Halliburton also blamed the governmental officials and BP. It criticized BP for its failure to run a cement bond log test. In the report, BP was accused of nine faults. One was that it had not used a diagnostic tool to test the strength of the cement. Another was ignoring a pressure test that had failed. Still another was for not plugging the pipe with cement. The study did not, however, place the blame on any one of these events. Rather, it concluded with the following statement blaming the management of Macondo: The panel also noted that the government regulators did not have sufficient knowledge or authority to notice these cost-cutting decisions. The report advises Changing Business as Usual June 2010 Department of Justice investigation  On 1 June, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that he opened an investigation of the oil spill.Attorney General Eric Holder on Gulf Oil Spill. U.S. Dept. of Justice. 1 June 2010. According to Holder, the Justice Department would be interviewing witnesses as part of a criminal and civil investigation. Besides BP, the investigation could apply to other companies involved in the drilling of the damaged well. June 2010 Congressional investigations  The United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted a number of hearings. On 30 April, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked Halliburton to brief it as well as provide any documents it might have related to its work on the Macondo well. Attention has focused on the cementing procedure and the blowout preventer, which failed to fully engage. A number of significant problems were identified with the blowout preventer: There was a leak in the hydraulic system that provides power to the shear rams. The underwater control panel had been disconnected from the pipe ram, and instead connected to a test ram. The blowout preventer schematic drawings, provided by Transocean to BP, did not correspond to the structure that was on the ocean bottom. The shear rams were not designed to function on the joints where the drill pipes were screwed together or on tools that were passed through the blowout preventer during well construction. The explosion may have severed the communication line between the rig and the sub-surface blowout preventer control unit such that the blowout preventer would have never received the instruction to engage. Before the backup dead man's switch could engage, communications, power and hydraulic lines must all be severed, but it is possible hydraulic lines were intact after the explosion. Of the two control pods for the deadman switch, the one that was inspected had a dead battery. Employee Tyrone Benton told the BBC on 21 June that a leak was spotted on a crucial piece of equipment in the oil rig's blowout preventer weeks before the accident, and that Transocean and BP were emailed about it. According to the testimony of Doug Brown, the chief mechanic on the Deepwater Horizon, on 26 May at the joint U.S. Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service hearing, a BP representative overruled Transocean employees and insisted on displacing protective drilling mud with seawater just hours before the explosion. One of the BP representatives on the board responsible for making the final decision, Robert Kaluza, refused to testify on the Fifth Amendment grounds that he might incriminate himself; Donald Vidrine, another BP representative, cited medical reasons for his inability to testify, as did James Mansfield, Transocean's assistant marine engineer on board. On 17 June, Tony Hayward testified before the Committee. The heads of Anadarko and Mitsui's exploration unit will testify before the Committee 22 July. In a statement made in June the Committee noted that in a number of cases leading up to the explosion, BP appeared to have chosen riskier procedures to save time or money, sometimes against the advice of its staff or contractors. In an 18 June statement, Jim Hackett, the CEO of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, said research \\"indicates BP operated unsafely and failed to monitor and react to several critical warning signs during the drilling. ... BP's behavior and actions likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct.\\" BP responded by strongly disagreeing with the Anadarko statement and said that, despite being contractually liable for sharing clean- up costs, Anadarko is \\"refusing to accept responsibility for oil spill removal costs and damages\\". BP has sent Anadarko a bill for $272.2 million; Anadarko is \\"assessing our contractual remedies\\". According to the US Congressional investigation, the rig's blowout preventer, a fail-safe device fitted at the base of the well, built by Cameron International Corporation, had a hydraulic leak and a failed battery, and therefore failed. On 19 August, Admiral Thad Allen ordered BP to keep the blowout preventer to be used as evidence in any court actions. On 25 August, Harry Thierens, BP's vice president for drilling and completions, told the hearing that he found that the blowout preventer was connected to a test pipe, rather than the one conveying oil to the surface. He said that he was \\"frankly astonished that this could have happened.\\" August‚ÄìSeptember 2010 BP reports  In late August, BP released findings from its own internal probe, which it began immediately after the spill began. BP found that on 20 April managers misread pressure data and gave their approval for rig workers to replace drilling fluid in the well with seawater, which was not heavy enough to prevent gas that had been leaking into the well from firing up the pipe to the rig, causing the explosion. The investigation also questioned why an engineer with BP, the team leader overseeing the project, ignored warnings about weaknesses in cement outside the well which could have prevented the gas from escaping. The conclusion was that BP was partly to blame, as was Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. On 8 September, BP released a 193-page report on its web site.BP. September 8, 2013. Deepwater Horizon Accident Investigation Report The report identified 8 key findings with respect to the cause of the accident. 1) The day before the accident, cement had been poured to fill the gap between the borehole (the actual hole in the ground) and the casing (the outermost pipe), and this cement failed and oil moved into that space from the reservoir. 2) Oil then entered the production casing (an inner pipe) although two barriers (one made of cement called a \\"shoe track\\"Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary Shoe Track definition) were supposed to prevent this. 3) A test was conducted as to whether the well was sealed (a negative pressure test), conducted by temporarily replacing heavy drilling mud with lighter seawater. This is controlled unbalancing of the well. The test was considered successful, although it was not, since oil was actually moving out of the reservoir. The report names the Transocean rig crew and the BP staff on hand as having made this error. 4) When the test was completed, the seawater was replaced with mud, which was brown stopping the flow. But later, when preparing to temporarily shut down the well, mud was again replaced with seawater, allowing oil to flow up the riser toward the rig. This flow was detected by pressure sensors on the rig. The report blames the rig crew for missing the increased pressure readings. 5) When the flow was noticed, the crew activated the blowout preventer and diverted the oil to a mud separation system rather than diverting it into the ocean; diverting it into the ocean may have spared much of the damage. 6) The design of the mud separation system allowed the oil to keep coming and gas carried by the oil to be vented onto the rig. 7) The venting system allowed the gas to move into areas of the rig where it would be in contact with electrical equipment. 8) The blowout preventer failed in several ways; controls on the rig were disabled by the explosion; an automatic shutoff system within the blowout preventer failed, probably due to failure of two components - a solenoid and battery; when a submersible was able to activate a blind shear within the blowout preventer, the blind shear functioned but failed to seal the well. Transocean, responding to the report, blamed \\"BP's fatally flawed well design.\\" References Category:Deepwater Horizon oil spill ","title":"Deepwater Horizon investigation"},{"id":"37977876","text":"Darius Hamilton (born December 29, 1993) is an American football defensive end who is currently a free agent.

It was directed by Claire Cowperthwaite and written by Tom Ceraulo and Matt Hubbard. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 17, 2013. The episode received generally positive critical reviews and was watched by 3.44 million viewers. Plot Liz and Jack are both torturing themselves, Liz because a conversation with Tracy has made her feel like she isn't exciting and spontaneous enough, and Jack over his mother's sarcastic and condescending final words, that she only wanted him to be \\"happy\\". The pair travel to Florida to settle his mother's estate, but receive a shock when her live-in nurse Martha (Lynda Gravatt) speaks of what a kind and loving person she was, something which contradicts everything Jack knew about her. Liz pokes around, only to discover that the pair had shared a bedroom, the walls of which are adorned with pictures of the two of them together, indicating that they were in a lesbian relationship. However, when she attempts to relay this to Jack, he refuses to believe her and dismisses their bed-sharing as being perfectly normal between two friends. Meanwhile, Tracy and Jenna have been left in charge of TGS and quickly run into trouble when a lawyer, Martin Lutherking (Tim Meadows), arrives to tell them that Hazel (Kristen Schaal) has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the show, citing inappropriate behaviour on the part of most of the staff. He explains that Hazel regularly sues shows that she has been sacked from, and that all they need to do is get everybody on the crew to sign an affidavit to deny that there has been any inappropriate behaviour. The only holdout is Kenneth, who, having already lost his page job and his girlfriend in the past year, doesn't want to lose his integrity too by lying. Tracy and Jenna are uninterested and tell him to sign anyway, which he reluctantly does. In Florida, Martha makes up a double bed for Liz and Jack, having mistaken them for a married couple. Liz sees an opportunity and challenges Jack to share the bed with her, since he is so determined that it had been perfectly ordinary between his mother and Martha. As the pair lie together, Liz wonders aloud why nothing has ever happened between her and Jack, since they have spent so much time together, and there had been occasions in the past when they'd both gotten drunk together and been on the rebound at the same time. She questions whether it was because she is uninteresting and unspontaneous, but Jack dismisses her, explaining that their half-friendship, half-mentorship is more interesting than a relationship would have been. The pair then get into an argument when Jack criticizes Liz for having made a visit to his late mother's house about herself. At TGS, Kenneth begins acting strangely as a result of having been forced to sell out his soul, and Tracy and Jenna soon begin to feel guilty. Finally, they let him tell the truth and he explains to Lutherking all of the inappropriate things that have gone on at the show. Back in Florida, Jack rescues Liz from the police station at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, when she gets into trouble trying to be spontaneous, and she resigns herself to the fact that she'll never change. Jack counters this, admitting that his mother had been in a lesbian relationship with Martha, and saying that if somebody like her could have a complete turnaround at eighty-five, so could Liz. Jack then realises that his mother's last words, that he should be \\"happy\\", were not meant sarcastically, but wonders if he has fulfilled them. Liz reminds him that he has, having finally achieved his goal to become CEO, which was what he had always wanted. Liz arrives back at TGS and receives a phone call from Bev (Megan Mullally) at the adoption agency, informing her that she can have two children right away, a brother and sister. Having only wanted one, Liz is taken aback, but decides to be spontaneous and agrees to have them. At that moment, Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) arrives to inform her that as a result of the controversy Hazel's lawsuit has stirred up, his last act as CEO is to cancel TGS. Reception \\"Florida\\" was watched by 3.44 million viewers and earned a 1.3 rating/4 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 4 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. \\"Florida\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, opined that \\"[it] wasn't necessarily one of the strongest episodes of this victory lap season of 30 Rock, in that I think there was probably an entire episode's worth of material in both stories, and having to split time made both feel only partially baked.\\" However, he concluded that \\"the episode was packed with so many great throwaway jokes that I could just spend this review listing them all.\\" Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- and particularly enjoyed the scene with Liz and Jack in bed, commenting: \\"For many viewers, the sight of these two in bed together has been a long time coming, and 30 Rock plays it off flawlessly and with a few meta winks to the audience. Liz asks Jack \\"why didn‚Äôt anything ever happen between us?\\" [...] Jack puts it best, both to Liz and the audience, when he responds that their current relationship is more interesting than them dating.\\" Roth Cornet of IGN scored the episode an 8.0 out of 10 and summarised \\"The show continues to deliver the wacky antics we desire, yet stay streamlined and propel the plot forward. What sometimes felt like an overly kinetic series of sketches and subplots in the early part of the season, has nicely coalesced into a push toward the sad, but inevitable, end.\\" Whitney Pastorek of Vulture was less favorable, giving the episode a 2/5 and commenting: \\"tonight‚Äôs 30 Rock served two purposes: to satisfy the shippers who always wanted Jack and Liz to sleep together, and to explain why TGS ‚Äî and thereby this entire series ‚Äî would soon be coming to an end. Truthfully, neither resolution was entirely satisfying. After last week‚Äôs volley of one-liners and intrigue, this week‚Äôs [episode] landed like a lead balloon\\". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic was positive, scoring the episode a 3.5/5 and commenting: \\"There were a few good Tracy bits along the way - asking Tim Meadows what kind of dinosaur is grandfather was, and saying that because he was a lawyer in a movie he knows all about winning your son's love back thanks to a magic camera come to mind - but it wasn't a laugh-heavy episode overall. That doesn't mean that it wasn't a good installment. They didn't try very hard for guffaws, which is surprising for 30 Rock, but is also better than attempting and failing all half hour long.\\" References External links * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:30 Rock (season 7) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Florida pt:Florida ","title":"Florida (30 Rock)"},{"id":"37977934","text":"Karl Peter Andreas Faber (12 August 1773 - 19 January 1853) was a Prussian archivist and historian.

A week of career training followed the 18 weeks of technical training. The program took students with little or no prior programming experience and taught them the fundamentals of computer programming. The program's goal was to develop the necessary skills within the students to make them job-ready for an entry-level developer position. According to Hoover, applicants to the 2013 Chicago programs had varied backgrounds, ranging from students who have master's degrees in computer science to a Starbucks barista. The program valued learning by building and doing; in contrast to traditional classrooms, Dev Bootcamp students worked through a series of programming challenges, usually working in pairs or small groups, which culminated in a final group project.About. Dev Bootcamp. The tuition costs were $13,950 in the New York and San Francisco locations, and $12,700 for the Chicago, San Diego, Austin, and Seattle locations for the 9-week, 40-hour-per-week program. Core class hours were weekdays 9am-6pm in San Francisco and 8am-5pm in Chicago. However, most students stayed nights and weekends, which amounted to an approximate 70‚Äì80 hours per week. Dev Bootcamp organized hiring days for technology companies to interview students. They then collected a referral fee from employers that hire their graduates, and they passed along part of that fee to the graduate in the form of a hiring bonus. In 2015, Dev Bootcamp tested a remote teaching model in a pilot program in Columbus, Ohio, which was canceled after the first round even though four of its 14 enrollees had already found jobs. The company announced it was closing its doors on July 23, 2017 via a press release. Phases The program was divided into three core phases, each lasting three weeks. In the first phase, students learned some of the fundamentals of computer programming in Ruby, including algorithms and database querying. The next phase introduced front-end technologies and combined them with previously learned material. The final phase brought everything full-circle with the Ruby on Rails framework. In this phase, students built a web application from scratch.FAQ \\"Dev Bootcamp FAQ\\" Students were also required to remotely complete 9 weeks of preparation material before the on-location courses began. Reception After its founding in 2012, Dev Bootcamp was featured in The Chicago Tribune, Fast Company, Business Insider, TechCrunch, and Inc. Magazine.

It consisted of documents from the state of the Teutonic Order, the Duchy of Prussia, and East Prussia. Most of it is now part of the Prussian Privy State Archives in Berlin-Dahlem. History For centuries the archive was held in the oldest part of K√∂nigsberg Castle, the western north wing. Documents were stored in oak drawers from the Teutonic era. In 1810 it became supported by the Oberpr√§sident of East Prussia. The first scientific archivists were Karl Faber and Ernst Hennig. Other archivists included Friedrich Adolf Meckelburg, Rudolf Philippi, Erich Joachim, Hermann Ehrenburg, and Paul Karge. The archive moved to a new building at Hansaring in Mittelhufen, constructed by Robert Liebenthal from 1929 to 1930. The last director of the archive was Dr. Max Hein. Most of the collection, including its most valuable documents, were evacuated from K√∂nigsberg before the end of World War II and stored in a salt mine at Grasleben. Troops in the British occupation zone then brought them to the Imperial Palace of Goslar. From 1953 to 1979 the collection was stored in G√∂ttingen. The evacuated K√∂nigsberg collection, about 85% of the pre-war documents, has been in the possession of the Prussian Privy State Archives in Berlin since 1979. It consists of almost complete collections from the Teutonic and ducal eras. There are numerous documents from the 18th century, but fewer from the 19th and 20th centuries. Other documents from the original collection which were not evacuated are in the possession of the Archiwum Pa≈Ñstwowe w Olsztynie in Olsztyn, the Lietuvos moksl≈≥ akademijos biblioteka and Lietuvos centrinis valstybƒós archyvas in Vilnius, and the Gosudarstvennyj Archiv Kaliningradskoj Oblasti in Kaliningrad.

Coming from a religious family, Bliss originally sought to become a minister. After giving up these aspirations, he attended Yale University and became a teacher. He then went to medical school and began his career as a physician in China. During his time in Shaowu, located in the Fujian province of China, Bliss provided general care and also performed research on the rinderpest virus. He remained in China throughout many significant political conflicts throughout the early 1900s before returning to the United States in 1932. A biography of Bliss ‚Äî Beyond the Stone Arches: An American Missionary Doctor in China, 1892‚Äì1932 (2001) ‚Äî was written by his son, journalist Ed Bliss. Early life Family Edward Lydston Bliss was born December 10, 1865 in Newburyport, Massachusetts.Bliss, Edward, Beyond the Stone Arches: An American Medical Missionary in China, 1892‚Äì1932. New York: Wiley, 2001. He was the second child of Charles Henry Bliss, a wholesale dealer for Schleicher and Sohne needles, and Emily Lydston Bliss. One of seven children, Edward Bliss had three sisters ‚Äî Clara, Marian and Mary ‚Äî and three brothers ‚Äî George, Charles and Will. The Blisses were a religious family that attended a Congregational church twice every Sunday. Charles Bliss served as superintendent of the Sunday school, which the children attended each week after morning service, and Emily Bliss worked on the missionary committee. Ambitions Bliss's religious upbringing influenced his early ambitions. He sought to become a minister and, in his early childhood, Bliss showed signs of this ambition. As early as age four he was found standing upon a tree stump, preaching the words, \\"Will 'ou, oh will 'ou be dood.\\" At age six he signed a card at Sunday school, reading, \\"I, the undersigned, hope I have found Jesus to be my precious Saviour, and I promise with his help to live as His loving child and faithful servant all my life.\\" Throughout his childhood and young adulthood Bliss remained active in the ministry. He spoke frequently at Christian Endeavor meetings and at adult services. He received overwhelming positive feedback for his preaching and therefore he believed ministry was indeed his calling. However, Bliss eventually realized that preaching was not his passion and he gave it up. While Bliss's first goal was to become a minister, during his adolescence he also experienced influences for the missionary work he would eventually take on. In high school, Bliss's neighbor, General Adolphus Greely, left for the first of his Arctic expeditions. This inspired Bliss so that he read many exploration books, including Henry Morton Stanley's story of Daniel Livingstone in Africa. Education Bliss attended Yale University for his undergraduate education. While in school, he studied under famed professors such as Noah Porter, Edward Salisbury Dana and William Graham Sumner. Bliss took a variety of courses ranging from Latin and Greek to physics and chemistry. He was involved in the Pundits, a Yale literary society, and also enjoyed attending baseball and football games as often as he could. Bliss graduated from Yale in 1887 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin and Greek. Early work After giving up his hopes of preaching, Bliss set his sights on becoming a teacher. After graduating from Yale he took a position as principal, sole teacher and janitor at the high school in Granby, Massachusetts. While teaching at Granby, Bliss discovered that teaching, like preaching, was not his passion. He then remembered the adventure stories he read when he was younger and concluded that he wanted to work abroad as a missionary. He said, \\"As soon as it was settled in my mind to become a missionary, I asked myself in what way I could best serve. The answer I thought was to become a doctor.\\" Before Bliss could attend medical school, however, he wanted to repay a debt he had to his father. He took a new teaching position in Chicago at the Harvard School for Boys, where he stayed for one year. Medical school After completing a year of teaching work at the Harvard School for Boys, Bliss returned to Yale and began medical school. While there he worked as an assistant to Dr. Herbert Smith, studying water quality in New Haven. Bliss completed the three-year course of study in two years and graduated second in his class in June 1891. Missionary work 1892‚Äì1932 On April 23, 1891, Bliss wrote to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, applying to be a medical missionary. Bliss requested commission to China reportedly because he believed in \\"the probability that, at no distant day, it will occupy the position of supreme influence among nations of the East.\\" He received a post as the physician for the mission in Shaowu, China. Bliss departed from San Francisco aboard the SS China on September 27, 1892. On February 8, 1893, four months after departing the United States, Bliss reached Shaowu. When Bliss arrived he immediately began studying the native dialect under the instruction of a teacher named Shi Xiansheng. Because many of the Chinese still utilized traditional medical practices, he did not have very many patients at first and he often studied the language for six and a half hours a day. Several months after his arrival, Bliss opened a small dispensary, equipped with medicine cabinets and a small operating table. He also planned to build a modern hospital as, at the time, the closest hospital was 150 miles away. Even then, Bliss had few patients, sometimes only one and at most five or six, in an entire morning. Finally, after breaking up a dogfight in the street using a long pole with a rag doused in ammonia on the end, Bliss received more patients. By April 1894, he was seeing 50 patients a day. This new workload created a need for a newer, larger dispensary, for which he requested funds from the American Board. The appeal was denied due to an American economic depression following the Panic of 1893. However, in 1896 building on a new dispensary began anyway, funded with Bliss's own money and \\"about 50 dollars or so\\" donated by friends. The First and Second Congregational Churches of Waterbury, Connecticut contributed $180, making the building of a new hospital possible in 1897 as well. Building was completed in 1898. Bliss finally returned home on furlough in 1898. He returned to China in 1900, where he remained except for his furloughs in 1908 and 1916. Bliss's work in Shaowu consisted of general medicine. He treated conditions such as leg ulcers, scabies, erysipelas, consumption and malaria, but was unable to perform major surgery. Furthermore, the size of the mission and his workload both increased over time. By 1920, the mission has expanded threefold and Bliss sometimes saw 100 patients per day. Therefore, Bliss needed assistance and starting in 1915, he requested the appointment of another physician. However, it was not until 1925 that the Missions Board answered his requests and assigned Dr. Walter Judd, a surgeon, to Shaowu. Cooperative It was Bliss's belief that in China \\"much of the disease is attributable to poverty\\" and that there was \\"a way to raise the living standards\\" of the Chinese. The \\"way\\" he was referring to was through a cooperative. He persuaded several Chinese Christians to form an association and buy a plot of land to use for agriculture. However, this project failed due to political instability in the region in the early 1900s and the resulting uncertainty of potential investors. Furthermore, many who had already invested demanded their money back because they were unsatisfied with the progress of the project. Although Bliss argued that it was long-term project, the investors persisted and the project was ended. Rinderpest work Bliss spent much of his time in China focusing on the immunization of cattle against rinderpest. Rinderpest is a virus of the Morbillivirus subgroup of the Paramyxovirus group, which also contains measles, influenza and polio.Prins and Weyerhaeuser, H.H.T. and F. J. (1987). \\"Epidemics in populations of wild ruminants: Anthrax and impala, rinderpest and buffalo in lake manyara national park, tanzania\\". Oikos, 49(1), 29‚Äì30. Bliss's battle against rinderpest began with his desire for milk, which he considered essential for good health. However, the Chinese did not raise cattle for dairy, but rather for plowing. Therefore, far less milk than was needed was available. When there was a rinderpest outbreak, this milk supply was depleted. Bliss raised his own cattle and goats in China and experimented with rinderpest prevention. He found that serums for immunization were available in Shanghai, but realized that the serum used for this was unattainable and unaffordable for farmers in regions like Shaowu. Bliss sought to find another method of immunization that was within the means of Shaowu. He built off of the discovery of Robert Koch, who found that if the bile from a rinderpest gall bladder were diluted with an equal amount of pure glycerin, it would lose its virulence and would be safe to inject after 10 days. This would provide immunity lasting several months. Bliss then deducted that if a cow was injected with a small quantity of rinderpest blood ten days after being injected with the bile, it would have immunity. He tested this and found he was correct. Bliss also discovered that the calves of immune cows had a temporary immunity that decreased as they aged. He found that if they were injected with a small amount of rinderpest blood within their first month of life, they would have immunity. Impact of Chinese medicine In his early years in Shaowu, Bliss considered one of his biggest difficulties to be competition with native medical practitioners. Traditional Chinese medicine in the early 1900s consisted of purely superstitious practices, such as charms and magic, or medicine practiced by the Chinese physician, who was usually unlicensed and gained his position through heredity.Cadbury, W. (1912). \\"Medicine as practiced by the Chinese\\". Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 39, 124‚Äì129. Rather than coming to the hospital at Shaowu for Western medical care, many Chinese still sought medical attention from such practitioners. Bliss witnessed practitioners who treated cancer by puncturing the skin with gold and silver needles, eyesores with bile from bear gallbladders, malarial fever with uncooked pears, rheumatism with snake meat, and many ailments with ginseng root. Political context =Early anti-foreignism= In the early years of the Shaowu mission, foreign hostility was common. The first doctor who arrived, Dr. Philip Osgood, was stabbed in the foot by a spear. Another early missionary was shot in the shoulder. Furthermore, the Chinese would not sell the missionaries any land to build on for two years. However, over time, hostility decreased and the people of Shaowu became more open to Western medicine and Christianity. In fact, Bliss stated in a letter home, \\"You must remember that Shaowu people are different from many of the Chinese in their attitude toward foreigners. Never since I came here have I seen any indication that the people don't wish us here.\\" =First Sino-Japanese War= In summer 1894, China and Japan went to war over control of Korea. A peace treating was signed on April 17, 1895, which required China to surrender the island of Formosa, present day Taiwan, and a section of Manchuria, the Liaodong Peninsula. There was then European interference, ending with new loans forced on China. This led to growing antiforeign feeling and the massacre of several missionaries in Gutian, just 200 miles from Shaowu. Therefore, Shaowu missionaries, including Bliss, were advised to retreat to Fuzhou, a port city with a large mission, for safety. Bliss remained at Fuzhou for two months until the danger passed. =Boxer Rebellion= While on furlough in 1900, Bliss received news of war in China. The Boxer Rebellion had just occurred. The conflict began as early as the late 19th century, when a rebel group in the Shandong Province began expressing resentment toward foreign missionaries. In 1897 they killed two German missionaries in the province.Mackerras, C. (2008). China in transformation, 1900‚Äì1949. (2nd ed.). Pearson Education Limited. Anti-foreign sentiments increased and led to killing of foreigners and Chinese Christians. In fact, in the Shanxi province, more than 200 missionaries were killed. While, the Fujian province experienced less conflict than many other regions, there was still a significant impact and Bliss received notice that the Shaowu mission had undergone some damages. He returned to China in 1900 to find his house empty and stripped of all doors and window frames. The hospital was damaged, as well. Its doors and window frames were also stolen and the waiting rooms were destroyed. All of the medicines and Bliss's microscope were stolen from the dispensary. The missionaries rebuilt the damaged buildings that year. =Xinhai Revolution= The Xinhai Revolution or the Revolution of 1911 was a nationalistic movement against the Manchu or Qing Dynasty. The impact of this movement was felt even in the Fujian province. Starting on October 31, 1911, and continuing until November 8, 1911, there was a widespread evacuation from Fuzhou. Women in children of the mission board in Fuzhou were evacuated to a foreign settlement outside of the city, near the United States consulate. Men remained in Fuzhou with protection from soldiers from the USS Bainbridge. The artillery battle between the rebels and the Manchus in Fuzhou began on November 9, 1911 and ended with a rebel victory. Rebel brigands also took control of the area just 25 miles south of Shaowu, where the missionaries now feared an impending outbreak. Bliss noted a \\"peculiar air of excitement\\" in the city, as if before a storm. The people of Shaowu were taking precautions, closing down and shuttering shops, as well as placing barricades in the streets. The imperial troops had left the city and there was now an almost complete breakdown of law enforcement. Bliss and the other missionaries began to take their own precautions, instituting a nightly watch. Then, on November 16, 1911, the Shaowu prefect declared the city's alignment with the Revolution and business returned to normal in the city. While Bliss believed there was no danger for the mission in Shaowu, the United States consul insisted that all Americans in the interior Fujian province retreat to Fuzhou. Bliss remained in Fuzhou for over seven months. In this time period, the Qing dynasty ended and the Nationalist Party founded a new government, the Republic of China. Thousands of young men joined the defense of this government. In fact 300 boys quit the Shaowu middle school in order to join. Two of Bliss's students became medical officers in the Revolutionary Army. Instability persisted as changes in political power, including the change of the leader from Sun Yat-sen to Yuan Shikai and the change of the capital, occurred. =Warlord period= From 1916 to 1928 instability existed in the newly founded Republic of China. In this era, many different warlords assumed power throughout Chinese regions. Reunification only occurred when Jiang-Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) led the Northern Expedition of 1927, setting up a government in Nanking led by the Nationalist Party or Kuomintang. The instability associated with China's unification affected Shaowu, where opposing armies invaded, took over, and then withdrew many times. In Fujian province, Bliss and all other missionaries in the region were evacuated to the Fuzhou mission. In this time period, anti- foreign feeling increased. British economic interests were heavily criticised and the United States perceived ambivalence toward Japanese attempts to gain Chinese territory were also flash points. Christianity again became a topic of protest.Lutz, J. (1976). \\"Chinese nationalism and the anti-christian campaigns of the 1920s\\". Modern Asian Studies, 10(3), 395‚Äì416. Two women working near Shaowu at an Anglican mission were kidnapped for ransom and then executed. Beginning in 1927 with the onset of the Chinese Civil War, there was a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. Southern Communist Revolutionary forces captured both Bliss and his colleague Judd at separate times. In both cases, the men were released because the local people, who knew the men and their work, interceded on their behalf. By 1928 however the situation in Shaowu appeared relatively safe, as Jiang and the Nationalists had gained control of the province. However, within the next two years, Jieshi‚Äôs control diminished as the Communist party gained power and set up their own state in Jiangxi. There were rumors that the communists would attack Fujian next so the women and children of the Shaowu mission were evacuated to Fuzhou. The Communist army finally invaded Shaowu in 1932, and would later set up a short lived Fujian People's Government. Bliss was forced to evacuate as the army reached city gates of Shaowu. He returned to America. Personal life Bliss met Minnie May Bortz on January 26, 1901. Bortz was employed in a teaching position at Pagoda Anchorage, 10 to 12 miles from Fuzhou. Bliss proposed on July 23, 1902. The couple married on September 22, 1902, and remained together until Bliss's death. They had three children together ‚Äî two daughters, Ruth and Beth, and a son, Edward Lydston Bliss Jr. Post-China life After returning to the United States, Bliss and his wife lived in Oberlin, Ohio, a town with long-standing connections to the China mission movement. May Bortz Bliss developed pernicious anemia and required care from her husband. When Bliss was 81 years old, the couple moved to his hometown, Newburyport. They lived there until September 1958, when they moved to Boston to live with their oldest daughter, Ruth. Death A malignant tumor was found in Bliss's throat in early 1959. He died in his sleep on January 22, 1960, at the age of 94. His wife, May Bortz Bliss, died seven years later in 1967. Legacy Bliss considered some of his most important work in China to be his medical training of many young men. He usually taught them materia medica and anatomy for about two years. After this, most became \\"druggists\\" who ran their own dispensaries, or \\"barefoot doctors\\" who practiced medicine in the countryside. Some went on to Nanjing for additional study. Three of his students went on to study in medical school. Bliss's legacy was also preserved through a book, Beyond the Stone Arches: An American Missionary Doctor in China, 1892‚Äì1932, written by his son, journalist Edward Bliss Jr., in 2001. Kirkus Reviews praised it as \\"a rousing account of a New England missionary doctor who worked for 40 years in China. ‚Ä¶ His exploits are chronicled from the last days of Imperial China through the various republics that arose in the wake of the 1911 revolution to the appearance of the Communists and the coming of WWII. Although it is common practice nowadays to view missionaries as agents of western imperialism, Bliss comes across well in his son's account‚Äîcompassionate without being paternalistic, and instructive without being domineering ‚Ä¶ an exemplary man whose faith and devotion provide a refreshing tonic against the ambivalence and cynicism of later ages.\\" References Category:1865 births Category:1960 deaths Category:People from Newburyport, Massachusetts Category:American Protestant missionaries Category:Christian medical missionaries Category:Christian missionaries in Fujian Category:American expatriates in China Category:Protestant missionaries in China ","title":"Edward Bliss"},{"id":"37978450","text":"Ashna Khvor Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Khomeyn County, Markazi Province, Iran.

He sped to the lead, dueled inside with Basmati. He inched away on the turn and drew off in the stretch to win by lengths. He was ridden by Rafael Bejarano. The horse made his stakes debut in the Jack Goodman Stakes on October 11, 2011 going six furlongs at Santa Anita Park. He had speed between foes, then stalked the pace a bit off the rail, came out three deep into the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch, inched away. Was ridden along to widen past the furlong marker while drifting in and was under a long hold late. The final time was 1:08.27. Secret Circle's next start was the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Sprint, on November 4, 2011 at Churchill Downs. He bumped with Shumoos leaving the gate, quickly recovered and forced a sharp pace in about path two, dueled with a slim advantage mid turn, shook clear of Trinniberg in upper stretch, widened his margin with a furlong remaining, wandered out towards the center of the track near the sixteenth pole, was guided back down and held on to win by a length.

The company is headquartered in Jerusalem, and has ten other offices around the world. In October 2015, Ex Libris was acquired by ProQuest and is now a ProQuest company. History Ex Libris started as an internal project at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1980 to develop a new library management system, as no system at the time was able to handle both Hebrew and Latin character sets as required by the University. The software was called Automated Library Expandable Program or ALEPH-100 (\\"Aleph\\" is also the name of the first letter of many Semitic alphabets). In 1983, Yissum (the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University) founded Aleph-Yissum Ltd., a new company to commercialize the software. Yohanan Spruch, the original developer of ALEPH, became the company's chief technology officer. Between 1983 and 1988, all of the eight universities in Israel bought the program and linked up in a network. In 1986 Ex Libris Ltd. was founded by technology entrepreneur Azriel Morag to market the software overseas. In 1993 ALEPH was deployed by the seventeen libraries of the Vatican and 200 libraries in 27 countries had bought it by 1995. In 1995 Aleph-Yissum merged with Ex Libris Ltd. and reorganized as the Ex Libris Group, headed by Azriel Morag as the group's chief executive officer. In July 1997, Ex Libris acquired Dabis, a leading vendor of automated library systems in the German speaking countries. In 1998, venture capital funds Walden Israel and Tamar Ventures invested over $4m in Ex Libris. In February 2000, Ex Libris acquired the rights to SFX, an OpenURL link server software, from the University of Ghent. Ex Libris popularized OpenURL, which later became the ANSI/NISO Z39.88 standard in the information industry. In July 2000, Ex Libris launched MetaLib, a federated search system that conducts simultaneous searches in multiple information resources such as library catalogs, journal articles, newspapers. In August 2002, Ex Libris launched DigiTool, a full function, digital asset management system designed for libraries and information centers. In 2004, Ex Libris launched Verde, an electronic resource management system that manages the acquisition and licensing of electronic resources. In July 2006, Francisco Partners became the sole owner of Ex Libris Group. In November of that year, Endeavor, the developer of the Voyager integrated library system, was merged into Ex Libris. In May 2007, Ex Libris launched the Primo library discovery and delivery service. In August 2008, Leeds Equity Partners acquired Ex Libris Group. In May 2009, Ex Libris launched the bX recommender service, which provides library users with recommendations for scholarly articles. Also in 2009, Rosetta was introduced as a digital preservation and asset management solution. In January 2011, in collaboration with four development partners, the company released the Ex Libris Alma library management solution, the first SaaS cloud-based library services platform, representing the company's shift from an on-premise to a SaaS technology provider. Golden Gate Capital acquired Ex Libris in 2012. Ex Libris acquired oMbiel and its product campusM, a mobile campus platform, in April 2015, marking the company's expansion to EdTech solutions outside the library. Leganto, the company's reading list management application, built on the Alma cloud platform, was launched in 2015, and was Ex Libris' entry into the teaching and learning domain. In December 2015, ProQuest acquired Ex Libris. It was announced at that time that Ex Libris would also manage the products of the Workflow Solutions division of ProQuest, such as Intota, Summon, and 360 Link. In February 2018, Ex Libris partnered with five universities across the US to collaborate on the development of a new research services platform, Ex Libris Esploro. It was the company's first step into the research services market. The company provides services to thousands of customers in more than 90 countries. As of 2015, Ex Libris served 43 of the 50 top universities in the world. Over 40 national libraries use Ex Libris solutions. In August 2018, Ex Libris acquired Research Research Limited (known as *Research), which offers coverage of funding opportunities and publishes news and analysis of research politics and funding in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

Follett \\"The Giving of Orders\\" is a 1926 essay by Mary Parker Follett.Follett, Mary Parker. \\"The giving of orders.\\" Scientific foundations of business administration (1926): 29-37. In it, she addresses issues of authority in business management, specifically how managers can gain influence over informal groups that naturally form in the workplace.Nohria, Nitin. \\"Mary Parker Follett‚Äôs view on power, the giving of orders, and authority: An alternative to hierarchy or a utopian ideology.\\" Mary Parker Follett‚ÄìProphet of Management (1995): 154-62. She found that people respond better to situations than to top-down orders and managers should give people the means and willingness to respond to given situations instead of merely giving orders: \\"My solution is to depersonalize the giving of orders, to unite all concerned in a study of the situation, to discover the law of the situation, and obey that.\\"  Background  As a young girl, Mary Follett faced many struggles. Her sister died while she was young and her father was in and out of her life. She was always involved in government and recent issues going on throughout her community. Although she had limited access to research funds and other resources, she was able to write two influential books;\\" The New State\\" and \\"Creative Experience\\" which were insights gained by twenty years of civic and professional work in Boston's immigrant neighborhoods. By commuting everyday from her home in Boston to Roxbury, she recognized the difference between both cities and decided to make changes in Ward 17. With so much involvement throughout her lifetime, she started a revolution.  Interpretation  By addressing the way managers gain influence over informal groups, Follett explains that training the employee can not only help them better understand their job description, but also helps the employer to be better understood. She argues that \\"orders should be the composite conclusion of those who give and those who receive them; more than this, that they should be the integration of the people concerned and the situation; more even than this, that they should be the integrations involved in the evolving situation.\\".Follet, M.P (1926), \\"The Giving of Orders\\", in Dynamic Administration; The Collected Works of Mary Parker Follet. Henry C. Metcalf and L. Urwick, Eds. New York: Harper and Brothers Publishers, 1941: 65-66 Follett found that workmen respond better to \\"the order integral to a particular situation\\", which is arrived at by \\"joint study of the problem\\". She argued that when \\"orders are simply part of the situation, the question of someone giving and someone receiving does not come up. Both accept the orders given by the situation.\\" In all, Follett cautions managers to avoid giving orders but rather to look with others to the situation at hand to determine an appropriate response.Massie, Cynthia (1995). \\"Teaching Introduction to Public Administration via the Case Method\\". Journal of Public Administration Education: 102-115 Follett felt that depersonalizing orders would foster collaborative decision making, in which managers and employees would \\"discover\\" the most appropriate decision. Follett developed the circular theory of power, distinguishing between \\"power-over\\" and \\"power-with\\" (coercive vs. co-active power), while also advocating for power sharing and employee participation.Hopen, Deborah (2010). \\"The changing role and practices of successful leaders.\\". The Journal for Quality and Participation, 33(1), 4-9. Contemporary context While Follett's writings were popular during her time period, they were nearly forgotten within ten years of her death. Scholars speculate that this could be due to gender discrimination and the fact that her ideas were too ahead of her time. Even though her perspective on voice is much more extreme than contemporary researchers, there has been renewed interest in her writings in the last couple of decades.Barclay, Laurie (2005). \\"Following In The Footsteps Of Mary Parker Follett: Exploring How Insights From The Past Can Advance Organizational Justice Theory And Research\\". Journal of Management History. Follett's work came during the height of Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management movement, which advocated the \\"one right way\\" for tasks to be performed, and Max Weber's view that direct hierarchy was the best form of leadership for larger organizations. The Giving of Orders challenged both of these paradigms and presented an alternative to purely top-down hierarchy in management. Many consider Follett ‚Äúthe Prophet of Management‚Äù because her ideas have affected the field of management for the past six decades.Mendenhall, Marsh, Mark E, W.

Design and development The AN.1 was a two-seat reconnaissance aircraft built primarily to explore the suitability of diesel engines in tasks requiring long endurance flying. In the early 1930s, diesel engines seemed to offer several advantages in such situations, particularly better reliability because of greater mechanical simplicity and lower fuel consumption, because of greater thermodynamic efficiency. Additionally, heavy oil fuel posed no fire risk and was at the time a fifth of the price of petrol. The AN.1 used a Fiat-built engine of the same name, much of which was based on the Fiat A.12 petrol engine, but with a new compression ignition upper half. It was a conventional biplane design, though little is known of its details. It first flew in 1930. Operational history After some short test flights at Fiat's Turin works, the AN.1 made its first long-distance flight to Rome, a distance of about 510 km (315 mi), piloted by Renato Donati in June 1930.

Often referred to by using popular brand names, such as the 'Happy Hut' or the 'Snuggle Sack', a parrot tent is typically hung from the roof of the parrot's cage using two or more clips. Several designs of tent are commercially available, for example soft canopies that sit over an existing perch, open-ended tubes and prisms, or fully enclosed teepee or dome-shaped bags with a single opening. Care must be taken to ensure that the parrot does not consume pieces of the tent or accidentally become entangled and trapped in frayed threads, both of which may occur if the bird's natural chewing instincts compel it to gnaw upon the fabric. The parrot may also come to view the tent as a potential nesting site, which may trigger unwanted behaviours in a pet bird, such as egg-laying and aggression in defence of the tent, although this varies from individual to individual. For these reasons, some avian experts advise entirely against the use of parrot tents.

Kaijage (born 1947) is a social worker who advocates for those infected with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Kaijage works to raise awareness about the disease and tries to assuage the negative social implications that accompany the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Kaijage is also the founder and director of the Tanzanian non-governmental organization, WAMATA, which educates and provides counseling services to those with HIV/AIDS. Education and career At the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Kaijage received a Bachelor of Arts in education in 1978. She then went on to receive a master's degree in Social work from Washington University in St. Louis in 1985. In 2004, Kaijage got her PhD in Social Work and Masters of Public Health from the University of Pittsburgh. Kaijage began her career as a school teacher in Tanzania and from there she became a Fulbright Scholar. After losing many friends and family members to HIV/AIDS, Kaijage saw a trend in the familial and social ostracism that accompanied the grim diagnosis. It was then that the vision of WAMATA emerged. Kaijage now dedicates her life to those with HIV/AIDS. She became a vital component in the battle to educate and trying to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Kaijage was especially important during the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) summit. During the UNAIDS summit, Kaijage proposed that mothers who are HIV positive should not breastfeed, but they should find alternate methods of feeding their infant. This caused great stir among the world health leaders who advocate that breastfeeding is the best way to feed infants in developing nations, even if the mother is HIV positive. This did not resonate well with Kaijage and she tried very hard to change this. In 1997, UNICEF and the WHO changed the guidelines on breastfeeding. Now mothers with HIV should avoid breastfeeding only when alternate means of nourishing the infant is acceptable, feasible, safe, affordable and sustainable. WAMATA WAMATA is a Swahili acronym for the phrase \\"Walio Katika Mapambano Na AIDS Tanzania\\" which means \\"People in the fight against AIDS in Tanzania\\". Kaijage opened her home to a young woman, infected with HIV and her child who was not infected. Kaijage observed that breastfeeding took a lot of energy from the mother; she would get out of breath and pass out. Kaijage would frequently have to rush her to the emergency room. Kaijage and the mother she took in sought out alternatives to breast milk. After the mother stopped breastfeeding, she became much healthier. She had more energy; she thrived and the baby thrived. This is what catalyzed Kaijage to invest all of her energy into WAMATA. A main goal of WAMATA is to empower women with their reproductive rights, as well as to provide information on mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Through counselling sessions offered by WAMATA, infected women learn about the risks of breastfeeding and alternative feeding methods, such as spoon feeding beans and juices, to ensure the long-lasting health of the child. With WAMATA, Kaijage seeks to \\"break down the barriers in health care by bringing AIDS care to the homes of those unable to leave their beds.\\" Kaijage does not only want to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS locally, but globally. The organization has received funding from the Clinton Foundation and the Global Fund in order to reach greater lengths and depths.

Because the church burned down in the great fire of 11 November 1764, it was rebuilt under the direction of Karl Ludwig Bergius and dedicated in 1769.

A timber company owns a majority of the surrounding property which it uses as timber farms.  History  Escambia County used the landfill 1950‚Äì1984. The landfill was operated in two sections, bisected by the Coffee Creek, with the northern section accepting normal municipal waste. The southern section initially accepted industrial waste, in addition to industrial waste. This waste was buried in unlined cells, anywhere between four and thirty five feet deep. In 1968, the southern section began accepting domestic sludge and sewage, and municipal sludge leftover from wastewater treatment operations. This waste was buried in unlined holding and drying ponds, which were later filled with construction and demolition debris when they became saturated. The ponds were covered over in 1976, however the following year sludge was again deposited on top of the ponds.

History Originally a Roman Catholic church known as \\"St. Barbara auf dem Berge\\", the church was built from 1334 to 1352 and then expanded in 1474. The top of its steeple was destroyed in a storm in 1497 and was rebuilt with four turrets. It was converted to Lutheranism after the 1525 establishment of the Duchy of Prussia. In 1608 Pastor Christoph Mirau wrote his Lobspruch der Stadt K√∂nigsberg. After a lightning strike destroyed the church's steeple in 1695, it was rebuilt in 1702 with a gallery and four turrets. Seven people died after the church's vault collapsed in 1717. The church was destroyed during the great fire of L√∂benicht on 11 November 1764; the steeple fell upon L√∂benicht's school, setting it ablaze. Johann Ernst L√∂ckel led the church's reconstruction, which was completed in 1776. In 1818 a storm damaged the flag and adornment atop the bell tower. The church was decorated with bright colors in the Rococo style. Its combined pulpit/altar (Kanzelaltar) was carved by Friedrich Suhse in 1776. The organ was built by Johann Preuss (1722‚Äì90) in 1782 and was decorated with Rococo carvings, music-playing angels, and the crowned Prussian eagle. The church was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and was not rebuilt by the Soviet Union after the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Pastor Link managed to bring a 1681 silver book cover from the church's collection with him to Hamburg in 1948. The church's remnants were demolished by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad, Russia, in 1970.

History At the beginning of the 17th century the Lutheran residents of Tragheim attended L√∂benicht Church and were buried in Steindamm's cemetery.Gause I, p. 411 Because L√∂benicht Church was too small for the growing community, Duke George William sold to Tragheim a square containing an old brick or tile manufactory on 23 May 1624. The Tragheimers moved their cemetery to their new square and constructed a small chapel from 1626 to 1632. The new church was dedicated in 1632 and received its own pastor in 1636.Albinus, p. 318 The first five pastors of the church were non-Prussians: Johann Benedikt Reinhardi was from Erfurt, Mauritius Karoli was from Brandenburg, Wolfgang Springer was from Holstein, Daniel Erasmi was from Frankfurt (Oder), and Thomas Masecovius was from K√∂nigsberg in der Neumark. In 1696 Jacob Heinrich Ohlius (1650-1725) became the first native of Prussia to be pastor in Tragheim. Because the original church collapsed in 1707, a new church was constructed from 1708-1710 according to designs by architect Joachim Ludwig Schultheiss von Unfriedt (1678-1753), with patronage from Friedrich Kupner. Its Baroque steeple was completed in 1723. When Tragheim Church burned down after a lightning strike in 1783, it was rebuilt the following year according to Schultheiss von Unfriedt's original design, under the direction of Johann Samuel Lilienthal (1724-1799)Johann Samuel Lilienthal (October 25, 1724 - November 7, 1799) was born and died in K√∂nigsberg. He was an Oberbaudirektor (Senior Building Director) and a Kriegs- und Dom√§nenrat (War and Domains Councillor). and Johann Ernst Jester.Johann Ernst Jester was a Prussian architect and surveyor. His most important publication is titled Praktische Abhandlungen zur Civil-Baukunst: oder aus Erfahrungen und Gr√ºnden gesammelte Anweisungen, welche bey allen b√ºrgerlichen Baulen als nothwendige und unentbehrliche Kenntnisse im Bauwesen und im gemeinen Leben vorkommen (K√∂nigsberg in Preussen: Gottlieb Leberecht Hartung, 1785) (440 p.)

Richard Wagner married Minna Planer (Christine Wilhelmine Planer) in Tragheim Church on 26 November 1836. The church was heavily damaged in the Bombing of K√∂nigsberg (1944) and in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg (April 6-9, 1945).

Sights The church contained a Rococo chancellery and pulpit with beautiful carvings made in 1784 by tischlermeister (master carpenter) Carl Johann Grabowski of K√∂nigsberg. The neoclassical altarpiece was created by the wood-carver Christian Benjamin Schultz from Heilsberg, and donated to the church by the apothecary Johann Sigismund Tiepolt and his wife Susanne (n√©e Bulle), who both died in 1800. The organ was designed in 1793/1794 by orgelbaumeister (master organ-builder) Christoph Wilhelm Braveleit (1751-1796). The church also contained an oil painting of E. A. C. Wasianski by Johann Friedrich Andreas Knorre (1763 - May 11, 1841), a distinguished portrait painter who was Director of the Provinzial-Kunst-und Zeichenschule (Provincial Art and Drawing School) in K√∂nigsberg from 1800-1841.

History Ausstellungshallen am Zoo (left) and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, postcard The Neo-Romanesque building at Hardenbergstra√üe was designed as an exhibition hall by architect Carl Gause (1851‚Äì1907), an alumnus of the Bauakademie who had also drawn plans for the Hotel Adlon. Like the Romanisches Haus nearby, the design followed the model of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at Auguste-Viktoria-Platz (present-day Breitscheidplatz), built in 1891‚Äì1895 according to plans by Franz Schwechten. The development of a \\"Romanesque forum\\" met the demands of Emperor Wilhelm II who even set guidelines for the design of streetlights and tram power lines.Romanisches Forum - Berlin.de Construction work took place from 1905 to 1906; the building complex initially hosted the Ausstellungshallen am Zoologischen Garten exhibition halls, named after the adjacent Berlin Zoo. In 1912, Arthur Biberfeld converted the western hall into a theatre. In 1913-15, projection facilities were installed by Oskar Kaufmann for the premi√®re of the film Quo Vadis, produced by the Italian Cines company, and from 1913 to 1914, the theatre was called the Cines-Palast.Ehemaliger Ufa-Palast am Zoo, Lexikon: Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf von A bis Z, Bezirksamt Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, City of Berlin, retrieved 19 December 2012 The other section of the building housed a caf√© and variety theatre called the Wilhelmshallen.Rudolf Woelky, EIN ETWAS ERLEBT ETWAS: ...

In 1925, the cinema was again rebuilt by Carl Stahl-Urach; it was enlarged to 2,165 seats by the addition of a balcony, the lighting was improved, and an illuminated cinema organ was added.Ken Roe, Ufa Palast am Zoo, Cinema Treasures, retrieved 20 December 2012.

Ufa-Palast, Memorial Church and Gloria-Palast, view from Zoo station, August 1926 The reopening on 25 September 1925 was overseen by Ern√∂ Rap√©e, a former employee of the American cinema impresario \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel who was brought over by Ufa together with Alexander Oumansky, who had been ballet director at Roxy's Capitol Theatre, to introduce US-style cinema shows to Germany. They were given an 85-member orchestra plus a jazz band, and Roxy himself came to offer assistance. The New York Times reported that the American \\"combination of symphony concert, ballet and film\\" had been successfully imported to Germany for the first time. Rapee stayed on for almost a year as manager and as Ufa's senior music director, in which role he arranged music to accompany several films; he left after supervising the opening of Ufa's new Gloria-Palast across the square.Ross Melnick, American Showman: Samuel \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel and the Birth of the Entertainment Industry, 1908-1935, Film and culture, New York: Columbia University, 2012, , pp. 253-54.

Following the renovation, the exterior was used for advertising, designed by Ufa's scenic designer Rudi Feld. This began with light displays and large posters and progressed to complete transformations of the appearance of the building. For example, for Spione in 1928, a gigantic stylised eye stared out of the centre of the fa√ßade and the letters of the title, written across the whole width of the central bay, became pupils which emitted searchlights;Ward, p. 171.Photo in Steven Heller, Mirko Iliƒá, The Anatomy of Design: Uncovering the Influences and Inspiration in Modern Graphic Design, Minneapolis, Minnesota: Quayside, 2009, . for Frau im Mond in 1929, the fa√ßade was draped in lights to evoke stars, and above the entrances skyscraper cities jutted out, from the centres of which model spaceships travelled to a moon globe and back;Ward, p. 169, Fig. 41, p. 170. and for Asphalt, also in 1929, a huge transparency of a street scene--taken from the credits--was mounted on the front of the building, with speeding cars in the foreground, and alternately lighted and darkened; wooden gates swung closed in front of it, with the title written on them in letters blazing with light.Ward, p. 157, Fig. 37. p. 158.Kreimeier, p. 117; photographs following p. 152. The exception was Fritz Lang's Metropolis, which received a double premi√®re on 10 January 1927: the gala premi√®re at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo was attended by President Hindenburg but advertised only by a sign above the entrance reading Welturauff√ºhrung (world premi√®re), while the smaller premi√®re, primarily for the press, took place at the smaller Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz (Germany's first purpose-built cinema, dating to 1912), which for the occasion was painted silver and illuminated \\"gleam[ing] like a beacon into the night\\", as a contemporary reviewer put it, and had a gong mounted over the main entrance; the film's brief German run continued there.Aitam Bar-Sagi, \\"'Metropolis' around the World\\", The Film Music Museum, 6 November 2010, retrieved 23 December 2012.Ward, pp. 166-67, Figure 40 p. 168.Review in Der Kinematograph, 16 January 1927, in translation in: Michael Minden and Holger Bachmann (eds.), Fritz Lang's Metropolis: Cinematic Visions of Technology and Fear, Studies in German literature, linguistics, and culture, Rochester, New York: Camden House, 2000, , pp. 82-83.\\"1927: Art & Culture\\", Starr Figura and Peter Jelavich, German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse, exhibition catalogue, New York: Museum of Modern Art / Distributed Art, 2011, , p. 280. Under the Nazis, for important occasions like the 1935 premi√®re of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph des Willens and the March 1943 celebration of Ufa's own 25th anniversary, Albert Speer modified the fa√ßadeSteven Bach, Leni: The Life and Work of Leni Riefenstahl, New York: Knopf, 2007, , p. 138. and it was dressed with large numbers of swastika flags spotlighted from below and with a huge eagle.Kreimeier, p. 254.Kreimeier, p. 322. For the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Speer designed a false front in simplified classical style. The following year, the remainder of the fa√ßade was similarly covered and heavy masonry pylons evoking the entrance to the Olympic Stadium set on either side of the entrance;Bach, Leni, p. 164. one architectural historian has noted that except for the lack of windows and the decoration with film posters rather than government symbols, the building then looked very like Speer's New Reich Chancellery.Kreimeier, p. 254, citing Dieter Bartetzko, Illusionen in Stein: Stimmungsarchitektur im deutschen Faschismus: ihre Vorgeschichte in Theater- und Film-Bauten, Rororo Sachbuch, Kulturen und Ideen, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1985, .

It is the first food-and-drug treatment model to be established in Africa. The program seeks to provide comprehensive HIV care services through its three-way mission: care, research, and training; It currently serves 3.5 million people, with over 60 urban and rural clinics in Western Kenya.  History  AMPATH began in 1989 as an educational medical partnership between Indiana University Medical School (IUMS) and Moi University to collaboratively improve health services, partake in health research and develop leaders in health care in the United States and Kenya. IU assisted in founding Moi University School of Medicine in 1990, Kenya's second medical school, and also consequently helped set up the healthcare system in western Kenya. In 2001, in the face of the deadliest pandemic in human history, the partners joined forces to create one of Africa's largest, most comprehensive and effective HIV/AIDS control systems. The eight members are Indiana University School of Medicine, Brown University School of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Lehigh Valley Hospital, Providence Portland Medical Center, Purdue University, University of Utah School of Medicine, and University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine. Today, in partnership with the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the United States government, AMPATH is expanding from an HIV focus to address the critical needs for primary health care, chronic disease care, and specialty care. Mission In AMPATH's definition of \\"healthcare,\\" the focus is on the patient, not the disease. If a patient is hungry, or without a job, or is the victim of discrimination or abuse, AMPATH will respond, a commitment that leads inexorably toward holistic care. Therefore, AMPATH not only treats over 140,000 HIV-positive persons at over 60 urban and rural clinic sites throughout western Kenya. It also partners with the UN World Food Programme to feed 31,000 HIV-affected persons daily, provide school fees, nutrition, and other assistance over 20,000 children left orphaned or vulnerable due to HIV/AIDS, and has enrolled 10,000-plus patients in income security programs, including agricultural extension services, micro-finance and small business initiatives. The program also conducts prevention and early treatment programs that demonstrate a community-based effort that can virtually halt the spread of HIV/AIDS. Local leadership is the key to sustainability of any global health effort, so all of AMPATH's programming is led and implemented by Kenyans. Sustainability is a core component of AMPATH at every level, as evidenced by the use of an advanced electronic medical record system to enable cost savings through task-shifting in clinical care (over 100 sites globally now host the AMPATH-originated Open Medical Records System, OpenMRS), overall program integration with the Kenyan government through a new partnership with the Ministry of Health, and a focus on developing income security for patients who will one day be able to pay for the care they receive. Nearly 1,000 Kenyan and American medical students have been trained through this program, and AMPATH has received over $59 million in funding from large groups like NIH and the Gates Foundation. Programs Agriculture & Nutrition For many patients, anti-retroviral drugs alone are not enough for full recovery, because of malnutrition and food insecurity. The partnership made the effort to ensure the full health and prosperity of its patients by setting up food support, agricultural, and nutrition programs. In conjunction with the World Food Program (WFP) and United States Agency for International Development, high-production farms were established in order to advance local self- sustainability in addition to mere food distribution. Additionally there is a nutrition program offering nutrition assessment, education and counseling. A comprehensive electronic system designed by the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University called Nutritional Information System (NIS) is used to record, organize, and assist effective food distribution. =Food Distribution= The WFP/AMPATH partnership began in 2005, and currently has distributed more than 250 metric tons of food, feeding over 30,000 people and 7,000 households per day. Each patient receives 6 kg of maize, 1.8 kg of pulses, and 0.45 kg of vegetable oil per month. The partnership feeds all of its nutrition-deficient patients (including those with tuberculosis and cancer), orphans, and HIV+ prisoners (who meet certain eligibility criteria of having a BMI less than 18.5)http://www.ampathkenya.org/ Dry foods like maize, beans, lentils, palm oil, RUTF, and fortified corn-soy blend are provided by the WFP and USAID, and fresh vegetables are provided by production and training farms. Production Farms There are 4 high-production farms and 2 teaching model farms, which produce approximately 6 tons of vegetables per week, with capacity to produce 11 tons/week. With a continuous source of water, these farms are able to produce a reliable, year-round supply of fresh vegetables. In addition to actual food production, the partnership stresses sustainability, and teaches modern farming techniques to its recovering patients so they are able to grow their own food. A new \\"client feed client\\" model of farming was introduced, in which clients given monthly food prescriptions simply walk to the nearest AMPATH farm and collect their prescribed amount at their convenience. This food is produced by other clients, giving them income. Children's Services The Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) program provides access to education, protection, shelter, food security, psychosocial support, medical care and economic security to any orphans or vulnerable children within the AMPATH catchment area. There are over 20,000 children registered in this program, in seven main clinic areas: Eldoret, Burnt Forest, Iten, Kabarnet, Mosoriot, Port Victoria and Turbo. Clinical & Public Health Services A number of partnerships to improve the clinical and public health services in Kenya with members of the AMPATH consortium are focused on different areas of health, including but not limited to: dentistry, emergency medicine, orthopedics, surgery, anesthesia, radiology, medicine, family medicine, and palliative care. Many of these programs are focused on training, but also centers such as the Drug Information Centre (DIC). Communicable Diseases =Household Counseling and Testing Program (HCT)= HCT workers enroll every individual in each community and register them in a database. In addition to testing for HIV, they also screen for tuberculosis and other chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, treat children for intestinal worms, deliver treated bed nets to prevent malaria, and provide nutritional counseling. It costs $1.50 per person to provide all of the services that are covered with HCT, except for the cost of the treated bed nets. =Maji Safi (Safe Water)= The Maji Safi program aims to make safe, clean water accessible for all, in both the community and the household. It supplies water treatment packets that are designed to kill cholera and typhoid fever bacteria. They are sold through the local shops (dukas). The community water wells and a hand washing curriculum are also being developed. The program hopes to ultimately expand the program to provide safe and available water for the 2 million living in the AMPATH catchment area. Family Preservation Initiative The purpose of the Family Preservation Initiative (FPI) is to provide financial support for its clients, whilst avoiding financial dependence. FPI offers income-generating programs that offer self-sustainable opportunities for its patients: capacity building services including business and agricultural training courses, business and agricultural consultancy, and access to loans and savings. Also FPI develops a number of different enterprises, including Valley Orchards, Green World Nursery, Cool Stream Restaurant, and Imani Workshops. =Imani Workshops= Imani Workshops is a handmade crafts business that reinvests 100% of its income to benefit its employees, all of whom are HIV+ patients in Western Kenya. During and even after recovery, many patients struggle with financial security and independence, made even more difficult by the social stigma associated with HIV+ individuals. Formed in January 2005, Imani Workshops is a part of The Family Preservation Initiative, aiming to give their patients, focusing on women, income-generating opportunities in order to be self sustainable and support their families. Imani Workshops creates workshops with jobs for these women to produce high quality handmade jewelry, accessories, clothing, bags, and other accessories. Maternal & Child Health AMPATH has partnered with the Kenyan government to provide improved access to primary healthcare to all children and extensive medical care to over 22,000 HIV-infected or exposed children. The program targets those children who have been infected or exposed to HIV from HIV- infected mothers, and offers HIV testing, antiretroviral medicines, preventative medicines, nutritional support, disclosure counseling, and adolescent support groups in 55 different locations in Western Kenya. =Reproductive Health= Formed in 2007 between the University of Toronto, Duke University, and Indiana University, the Reproductive Health program aims to improve reproductive health in Western Kenya through the ALARM international program and the Cervical Cancer Screening and Treatment Program. The ALARM (Advances in Labor and Risk Management) international training program is a five-day training program mainly targeting health professionals designed by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. The main purpose of the program is to help reduce death and injury caused by pregnancy, childbirth and unsafe abortion. The program emphasizes discussion of sexual and reproductive rights as well as hands-on practice of clinical procedures. The Cervical Cancer Screening Program (CCSP) began in 2008, aiming to ultimately reduce the amount of cervical cancer in Kenya. Since then, over 1,100 women have been screened, 80 have gone through curative treatment for cervical dysplasia (LEEP), and 19 have had hysterectomies performed on them. =Riley Mother and Baby Hospital= Riley Mother and Baby Hospital (RMBHK), the vision of Dr. James A. Lemons of Indiana University School of Medicine, opened April 29, 2009 in Eldoret, Kenya, and is part of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. RMBHK is focused on providing services for pregnant mothers as well as their babies through education, training and research. The hospital accommodates 12,000 deliveries a year, serves as the teaching hospital for nearly one-third of all doctors in Kenya, and includes the first and only neonatal intensive care unit in East Africa. Primary Care & Chronic Diseases The partnership will deliver comprehensive primary healthcare to a target population of 500,000 people through 5 innovation sites, emphasizing essential health care at the community, dispensary, and health centres. Its HIV clinics are transitioning into more comprehensive clinics that address many other chronic diseases, including a diabetes program, an oncology center, and cardiovascular and pulmonary care. Research The AMPATH Research Network was founded in 1998, overseeing research projects aimed to improve the health and health care systems of Kenya. Over 170 publications have resulted from these collaborations between more than the 19 universities have taken part in the research program, which include Brown, Yale, Columbia, UCSF, Duke, Purdue, Stanford, NYU, and University of Toronto. The program has received over $67 million in direct costs in research grantshttp://medicine.iu.edu/ampathresearch/ Social Health There is also involvement in a number of projects geared towards social work, with 35 social workers serving over 100,000 people. The B-Fine Women's Project (Burnt Forest Initiative for the Empowerment of Women) is designed to reduce HIV risk of commercial sex workers in the Burnt Forest area, offering diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI), HIV testing, counseling, cervical cancer screening, and gynecology care. In addition to the B-Fine Women's Project, there are mental health services and a women's shelter (Amani Women's Shelter). Current Work There are currently over 60 urban and rural clinic sites. This map shows some of the various sites across the country and the details of the involvement and work. The work in relieving its HIV+ patients continues, but the partnership has also become research-oriented in the past years, with its main strides in cancer research. The program is also making full use of modern-day technology, using Google‚Äôs open source mobile operating system (Android) as a data collection tool in its Home-based Counseling and Testing (HCT).

It was the 125th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the second for that year. While the chipmunks are usually antagonists of Donald Duck, they have pestered Pluto before, in Private Pluto (1943) and Squatter's Rights (1946). It is one of the few Disney shorts directed by Jack Hannah not to star Donald Duck, although Donald does make a cameo at the end. Plot Mickey and Pluto are searching for a Christmas tree, while Chip and Dale are looking for acorns in the forest. Once the chipmunks see Pluto, they hit him with acorns and scurry from his chasing. Once Pluto is distracted, they hide in a tree. Mickey chops down that very tree, unaware that the two are in it. Once they get home, Mickey and Pluto decorate the tree and Pluto admires it, but then he notices a light going on and off; his nose is near the light Dale was playing with. Pluto and Dale bark at each other and Dale throws some ornaments down for Pluto to catch. Mickey comes by and takes the ornaments from him to put back on the tree. Pluto chases Dale up to the top of the fireplace with Santa candle figures and gets the hat and beard from a figure near him. Pluto notices the strange figure, but he does not get a chance to expose him to Mickey. Pluto knocks the other figures away except Dale. Chip then notices from the tree what is going on. He rescues Dale and heads for the tree. Pluto gets his feet stuck in presents and has difficulty following the chipmunks up the ladder. While Pluto is barking, the chipmunks cause the ladder to fall and drop the star on top of the tree onto Pluto's tail. While the chipmunks laugh in victory, Pluto, finally pushed beyond his patience, angrily dives in the tree to attack the chipmunks. Mickey notices Pluto and tries to pull him out, but gets pulled in instead until the tree is stripped of its decorations and leaves. Mickey scolds Pluto for what he did, but notices Chip and Dale with only a few decorations and all of the branches bare, finally realizing what's really going on. Pluto starts barking at the chipmunks for the trouble they caused until Mickey tells him to stop, saying that it's just the holidays. At the window they see Donald, Goofy and Minnie singing \\"Deck the Halls\\". While the three are singing, Chip and Dale join in and then Pluto howls in. Chip and Dale find it annoying, and therefore put a sticker that says \\"DO NOT OPEN TIL XMAS\\" over his mouth.

The group was formed in the late 1990s during the reign of Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the cartel, to provide security to the organization's leaders as the cartel's armed wing. The leader of Los Metros, Mario Ramirez Trevi√±o, alias X-20, was arrested on 17 August 2013. Fight with Los Rojos In the late 1990s, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas. Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo. The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf cartel began in 2010, when Juan Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez, nicknamed El R-1, was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to the \\"Frontera Chica,\\" an area that encompasses Miguel Alem√°n, Camargo and Ciudad Mier ‚Äì directly across the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez wanted was given to Samuel Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos. Unconfirmed information released by The Monitor indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez and Rafael C√°rdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego. C√°rdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n (Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010. Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were \\"too soft\\" on the Gulf cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas. When the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas split in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas. InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to the C√°rdenas family stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros. Originally, the Gulf cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf cartel triggered when Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011. When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retain control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas.

Its patron saint was John the Baptist. History As part of his investiture as Duke of Prussia in Warsaw in 1611, Elector John Sigismund agreed to the building of a church for Catholics in mostly Protestant K√∂nigsberg. The church was built in Sackheim from 1614 to 1616, but burned down during the great fire of 11 November 1764. It was rebuilt from 1765 to 1776 under the direction of Johann Samuel Lilienthal, who also constructed the chaplain's Kaplanei northwest of the church from 1770 to 1772. The rebuilt Baroque church was dedicated in 1777. In 1810 Max von Schenkendorf led an obsequy for the popular Queen Louise at the Propsteikirche with music by Johann Friedrich Reichardt. The church was taken over by the Old Catholics in 1876. In 1868 Julius Dinder was appointed provost of K√∂nigsberg in Prussia, and by 1889 the church had been reverted to the Holy See. In 1886 Dinder became Archbishop of Gniezno (Gnesen-Posen). The church was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. The Soviet administration in Kaliningrad demolished the remnants in the 1960s.

The Mosul Vilayet was part of the Ottoman Empire until the end of World War I, when it was occupied by Britain. After the Turkish War of Independence, the new Turkish Republic considered Mosul one of the crucial issues determined in the National Pact. Despite constant resistance, Britain managed to bring the issue into the international arena, scaling it down to a frontier problem between Turkey and Iraq. The League of Nations Council appointed an investigative commission that recommended that Iraq should retain Mosul, and Turkey reluctantly assented to the decision by signing the Frontier Treaty of 1926 with the Iraqi government in 1926. Iraq agreed to give a 10 percent royalty on Mosul's oil deposits to Turkey for 25 years. History English and Ottoman officials meet in northern Iraq during November 1918 Near the end of World War I, on October 30, 1918, the debilitated Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom signed the Armistice of Mudros. The agreement stipulated a cessation of hostilities effective October 31, 1918. For the British, \\"It was most desirable that Mosul should be occupied by the British force and General Marshall should send a detachment to Mosul to accept the surrender of the Turkish garrison.\\"V.H. Rothwell: Mesopotamia in British War Aims, in: The Historical Journal, Vol. 13, No. 2 (1970), p. 291. After discussions with Ali Ihsan Pasha, the local Turkish commander, and communications between London and the Ottoman government, where the British justified their intent by reference to Clause 7 of the agreement as well as their intent to proceed in any event, the local commander was instructed to withdraw and the British occupied Mosul on 10 November, 1918. In August 1920, the Treaty of S√®vres was signed to end the war, however the Ottomans still contested the British right to Mosul as being taken illegally, post-Mudros. Even when the Lausanne Treaty was signed between Turkey and Britain in 1923, Turkey maintained that Britain was controlling the Mosul Vilayet illegally.The Geography of the Mosul Boundary \\"The Geographical Journal\\" by H.I. Lloyd 1926 British officials in London and Baghdad continued to believe that Mosul was imperative to the survival of Iraq because of its resources and the security of its mountainous border.\\"The Creation of Iraq: 1914-1921\\" by Reeva Spector Simon and Eleanor H. Tejirian, New York: Columbia University Press 2004 Turkish leaders were also afraid that Kurdish nationalism would thrive under British Mandate and start trouble with the Kurdish population in Turkey. In order to reach a resolution on the conflicting claims over Mosul, the League of Nations was called on to send a fact-finding commission to determine the rightful owner. The commission investigated the region and reported that Turkey had no claim to Mosul, and it belonged to the British and no one else had any rightful claim to the area. Britain was highly influential in the League of Nations. The Secretary of the War Cabinet, Maurice Hankey, had already decided that Britain needed to have control over the whole area because of their oil concerns for the Royal Navy, before the commission's work was completed. Because Britain also wanted to soothe Turkish anger over the League of Nations decision, they gave them a portion of the oil profits. By having control over the oil and the Iraq Petroleum Company, the British stayed in control of the resources of Mosul even though they had given political control back to Faysal. Another area of contention between Britain and Turkey was the actual boundary line. There was a 'Brussels Line' which had been decided by the League of Nations as the true border of Iraq, and a British line which was the division line the Britain had used as reference in the past. When this was brought up to British leaders, both Percy Cox, the British High Commissioner of Iraq, and Arnold Wilson, the British civil commissioner in Baghdad, urged Lloyd George, who was the Prime Minister, to use the Brussels line because they did not think there was that large of a difference between the two line boundaries.The Geography of the Mosul Boundary: Discussion \\"The Geographical Journal\\" 1926 Other claimants Kingdom of Iraq The Mosul Vilayet was not just contested by external powers, i.e. Britain and Turkey; Faysal ibn Husayn, the Hashemite ruler who had become the king of the newly created state of Iraq by the British in 1921, also wanted to claim the Mosul Vilayet as his. The British liked, and respected Faysal because of all of the assistance he had given to them; the British also felt that they could trust him to do what they wanted. In this belief, Britain was both right and wrong. Faysal was a brilliant diplomat who was able to balance what the British wanted and the true needs of his people into a very complex system. However, one of the things he wanted most was the unification and strong status of Iraq and he did not believe that was possible without having control of the Mosul Vilayet. Prior to the League of Nations decision, Faysal had continually petitioned the British government to give control of Mosul to him so that he could succeed in his aim of unification. Finally, after the League of Nations decision, the British agree to let Faysal have control over Mosul in return for important resource concessions. The British founded the Turkish Petroleum Company which they later named the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC). Kurds Another internal group that wanted control over Mosul was the Kurds. The Kurds were the natural inhabitants of the Vilayet and made up over 60% of the population in the region, they did not want to belong to any other government other than their own. They had long fought against being integrated into Iraq because they wanted independence. Most Kurds did not consider themselves as a part of the new country of Iraq. Various Kurdish leaders rallied Kurdish groups who already had their own firepower and had been helped by different imperial powers on occasions when it suited their needs. Furthermore, many Kurds felt betrayed by promises the British had made to them in earlier times and subsequently not kept. Faysal wanted to integrate them because, as by a majority Sunnis, he needed them to balance out the Shiite population. Britain used both the Kurdish firepower and Faysal's desire for a united Iraq in order to keep a stranglehold over him, and later Iran used the Kurds and their firepower in order to keep unrest in Iraq during the reign of Khomeini. The Kurds did not want to be integrated into Iraq; however they did support the continuance of the British mandate in the area. Demographics The vilayet had an Arabic speaking population, a large Assyrian Syriac speaking population and a Kurdish speaking population, and in contrast to Mosul's neighbors, it was much more directly integrated into the Ottoman Empire.\\"A History of Iraq\\" by Charles Tripp, New York: Cambridge Press 2007 With regards to the religious communities, it was predominately Sunni with notable communities of Turkmen, Kurds, Assyrian Christians and Jews with a total population of about 800,000 people in the early 20th century.The Mosul Dispute \\"The American Journal of International Law\\" by Quincy Wright These communities and their respective leaders were heavily influenced by the political hierarchy, trading networks, and the judicial system of the Ottoman Empire, even though they considered themselves on their own and not completely controlled by the empire. Economic resources An 1876 sketch of Mosul During the period of Ottoman rule, Mosul was involved in the production of fine cotton goods. Oil was a known commodity in the region and it became critically important during World War I and continuing until today. Mosul was considered a trading capital of the Ottoman Empire because of its location along the trade routes to India and the Mediterranean; also it was considered a political sub-capitol. Local politics The leadership was constantly plagued with accusations of corruption and incompetence, and leaders were replaced with an alarming regularity.\\"Ottoman Administration of Iraq 1890-1908\\" by Gokhan Cetinsaya New York: Routledge, 2006 Also, because of these problems, the administration of Mosul was entrusted to Palace and notable favorites, where the high official's careers were usually determined by tribal issues within their states.

Misaskim provides moral support and bereavement assistance to individuals experiencing crisis or tragedy. This is achieved by providing vital community services, which include safeguarding the dignity of the deceased, assisting the bereaved by providing free shiva-related services and supporting individuals during these times. History Misaskim was founded in Brooklyn in 2004 by a group of Hatzalah (volunteer ambulance) members and other community activists who perceived the need to help families during the painful time when a loved one dies. The small group decided to set up an organization with a twenty-four-hour hotline. They named it Misaskim, which is the Ashkenazi pronunciation of a Hebrew word which means 'attendants', a term used for members of a Chevra Kadisha (Jewish burial society). Over time, additional programs and projects were added to Misaskim's original services of helping the bereaved.Yated, September 22, 2010 Misaskim is directed by Yankie (Jack) Meyer, one of the organization's founders, and Meir Weill. Services During major catastrophes or accidents with Jewish casualties, Misaskim dispatches a team of volunteers to any location in the United States on a moment‚Äôs notice. Misaskim‚Äôs mourners' services ensure that the week of shiva (mourning) is a little bit more comforting and comfortable by providing aveilim (mourners) with necessities, from low chairs to Torah scrolls, from folding beds to fax machines. Care for the dead Misaskim safeguards the dignity of the deceased by advocating to prevent autopsies and/or cremation, and educating government officials and coroners regarding respect to the Jewish departed. Mourner's needs Misaskim provides items needed for observing Shiva after the death of an immediate family member. They provide low chairs, Siddurim, Sefer Torah, folding chairs, guide to the customs of Shiva, and many other items needed. They deliver these items free of charge. Crisis relief When disaster or tragedy strikes, Misaskim deals with the situation in a professional, efficient manner that is acceptable to the law and respectful to the deceased. Trained volunteers clear crime scenes upon request by local law enforcement, find burial plots and arrange for the funeral, when necessary, and assists other Hebrew burial societies, providing sound systems, generator-powered lights for nighttime burials and solving many logistical problems in order to arrange a funeral in a timely manner. Other services Misaskim reaches out to the orphans of the recently deceased with a plethora of age-appropriate services, trips, gifts, and counseling, when necessary.

It contains a single species, Ardeadactylus longicollum, which was originally thought to be a species of Pterodactylus, as P. longicollum. History Only two specimens of Ardeadactylus are known to exist currently: SMNS 56603 (earlier SMNS 5802) found in 1874, a specimen from Nusplingen initially thought to belong to the species Pterodactylus suevicus (currently Cycnorhamphus),Fraas, O., 1878, \\"√úber Pterodactylus suevicus, Qu., von Nusplingen\\", Palaeontographica, 25: 163-174 and the neotype of the species, JME-SOS 2428, a specimen held at Jura Museum in Eichst√§tt.

The original holotype, consisting of the skull, neck and anterior torso, had been found near Eichst√§tt in 1853 and was that year acquired for the Herzoglich Leuchtenbergische Naturalien-Kabinett by Professor Ludwig Frischmann. Its destruction motivated Peter Wellnhofer to assign a neotype in 1970.Wellnhofer, P., 1970, \\"Die Pterodactyloidea (Pterosauria) der Oberjura-Plattenkalke S√ºddeutschlands\\", Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Mathematisch- Wissenschaftlichen Klasse, Abhandlungen 141: 1‚Äì133 Description Ardeadactylus is suspected to be a heron‚Äìlike, long‚Äìnecked long‚Äìlegged piscivore. It was similar to Pterodactylus antiquus in its general body form, but seems to have been larger. Bennett (2013) estimated the wingspan of the neotype specimen to be ; the referred specimen from the Jura Museum is more or less 10% larger.

Influenced by his experience in the Panic of 1837, he became an early advocate of fiat money. His ideas later influenced the Greenback movement and the Populist Party. Life and career After a brief stint in business in Norwalk, he relocated to New York City and established Edward Kellogg & Co., a wholesale dry goods firm, which he operated until 1837. By that time, he was heavily invested in real estate in Brooklyn and moved his family there to facilitate the management of his properties. This, together with his financial studies, would occupy most of his time for the remainder of his life.Freepages section of Ancestry.com  Economic ideas  Following the Panic of 1837, he began to think about the monetary system and what he believed its faults were. He was especially concerned about interest, which could often reach usurious levels. His first proposal was that all paper money should be issued by the government. (At that time, most banks issued their own private paper notes.) The government's notes would be low interest and backed by real estate. Simultaneously, the government would issue bonds (at the same interest rate) that could be exchanged for the notes. This, he believed, would keep interest rates tied to actual economic growth. The notes could also be redeemed for gold or silver, twice yearly, and would be insured by a National Safety Fund. In 1843 Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, convinced Kellogg to publish his opinions. They were issued in tabloid form under the title \\"Usury: the Evil and Remedy\\". With a few additions and changes, it was reprinted the next year as a pamphlet, under the pseudonym Godek Gardwell, and renamed \\"Currency: the Evil and Remedy\\". In 1849, it was given the title \\"Labor and Other Capital\\" and published as a book. His daughter put out a new edition in 1861 and it was retitled again, as \\"A New Monetary System\\",Los Angeles Public Library and various entries from the Library of Congress  Influence on later movements  During his own lifetime, Kellogg's ideas garnered interest from Greeley and some other public figures, but they never came close to being adopted. Kellogg's proposals gained new attention during the American Civil War, when the United States began printing banknotes as a matter of wartime necessity. After the war, Alexander Campbell adopted aspects of Kellogg's proposals, calling for the permanent usage of fiat money. Campbell's works served as the intellectual basis for the rise of the Greenback movement and would later influence the Populist Party.The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.

He initially started his work through the London Missionary Society in Hankow in 1875. In Hankow, he treated patients in the London Missionary Society hospital, learned Chinese, and engaged in evangelism. The majority of the cases he treated were eye disease, opium addiction, and cases involving surgery. In 1878, MacKenzie transferred to Tientsin due to the failing health of his wife. In Tientsin, MacKenzie constructed and ran a hospital with the help of the Viceroy's patronage and also established the Tientsin Medical School. MacKenzie also helped in the organisation of the Medical Missionary Association in China and the editing of the Medical Missionary Journal. He employed evangelism in many parts of his work but died an early death in 1888 due to smallpox. Early life John Kenneth MacKenzie, an English medical missionary to China, was born in Yarmouth, England on 25 August 1850. His father, Alexander Mackenzie, was a Scotsman from Ross-shire and his Welsh mother, Margaret Mackenzie, was from Breconshire. Both sets of grandparents were extremely religious. After moving to Bristol when he was an infant, John MacKenzie's father became deeply attached to Reverend Matthew Dickie at the Presbyterian Church. This created a very religious environment at the MacKenzie household. John was described to be reserved but easily provoked as a child, as well as having a sympathising heart. After attending a private school in Bristol, he wasn't fond of studying so he left school at age fifteen and became a clerk in a merchant's office. MacKenzie started to regularly attend the meetings of the Young Men's Christian Association in Bristol. Even though he stopped attending the meetings, Christianity was still a very strong influence in his life. MacKenzie spoke to his friend Colonel Duncan about how he had an urge to engage in the Lord's work in foreign fields so Colonel Duncan recommended that MacKenzie read a book entitled, \\"The Double Cure; or, What is a Medical Mission?\\" After reading his book, MacKenzie decided to ask his parents if he could quit his job and begin to study medicine with the goal of going to China as a medical missionary. MacKenzie's parents agreed and he quickly enrolled into medical school. Education In October 1870, John Kenneth MacKenzie enrolled in the Bristol Medical School and received his M.R.C.S. London and L.R.C.P. Edinburgh diplomas in four short years. While in Edinburgh, MacKenzie met Dr. Lowe, a member of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. MacKenzie had already expressed interest in travelling to China from reading memoirs of Burns and Henderson, but Dr. Lowe strengthened his desire by explaining China's great need of a medical missionary to take charge of a hospital in Hankow. Thus, MacKenzie decided to offer his services to the London Missionary Society for medical missionary work in Hankow. He set off to China on the S.S. Glenlyon on 8 April 1875. Medical missionary work in China Hankow On 8 June 1875, MacKenzie was welcomed to Hankow by Mr. and Mrs. Griffith John as well as Mr. Foster, his future colleagues. Hankow, previously known as the \\"Heart of the Empire\\", is large and situated in the middle of the central province of Hupeh where the Yang-tse River and the Han River meet. In Hankow, MacKenzie assisted Dr. Reid at the local missionary hospital and dispensary. In addition, MacKenzie also took daily Chinese lessons after work in the hospital. He faced tremendous prejudice because many of the Chinese did not trust the medicine of the foreign on the part of the Christians living in Hankow. But after MacKenzie successfully attended the chief deacon of the Hankow Church, the distrust was alleviated. In August, MacKenzie suffered heavily from Malaria, but recovered in a month and he soon became head doctor at the hospital. Although he was very busy in the hospital, MacKenzie felt the urge to help the surrounding villages in the country-side surrounding Hankow. He and Mr. Joh, a colleague, visited a number of villages where eye disease was the most prevalent cases. At some of the villages they met physical hostility toward foreign Christians, but after meeting with the chief magistrate of the district, the magistrate issued a proclamation through the district and the villagers were much more welcoming the second time around. Word of the foreign doctor soon spread all across the province of Hupeh. John MacKenzie cured hundreds of opium smoking patients and thousands of other patients. He discovered that many Chinese doctors were coming to him with questions and he realised that they had little to no knowledge of anatomy of physiology. He began his plans to construct a medical school with the hopes of teaching the Chinese how to perform surgery. In December 1876, Dr. MacKenzie travelled to Shanghai to marry Miss Travers, the woman he met while doing Christian work in Bristol. They returned to Hankow and continued their daily work; MacKenzie worked at the hospital and cured an average of 100 patients each day and Miss Travers began to learn Chinese. There was a cholera outbreak that MacKenzie treated and there was also an increase in surgeries, indicating the building trust of the Chinese to western medicine. Tientsin In March 1879, Dr. MacKenzie and his family moved stations from Hankow to Tientsin. This move was due to family matters for the health of his wife was failing and he believed a change in environment would be best. At this time, Dr. MacKenzie also had a daughter named Maggie. Tientsin is located in the North very close to the capital, Beijing. It was the port of the capital at that time. Upon his arrival at Tientsin, the city had no hospital or foreign drugs, only a small dispensary ran by Mr. Pai. MacKenzie used his own money to buy foreign drugs to dispense to people in need but only a few showed up each day. After curing a general one day, he discussed with him his plans of building a new hospital. This information was passed onto the Viceroy of the province who decided to help fund the construction and running of the new hospital. After the completion of the hospital, residents of Tientsin and the surrounding areas came in great numbers to be treated. MacKenzie treated many cases of eye disease, performed many surgeries, and gave out thousands of vaccines. He was assisted in 1887 and 1888 by Dr. Fred Charles Roberts, who would end up succeeding Mackenzie after his death. Chinese Medical School Even though MacKenzie was struggling to keep up with the hospital, he still had the goal of creating a medical school in China to teach the Chinese of western medicine. His proposition was accepted by the government and thus, he received eight students who were to be used as medical officers by the government after their education with MacKenzie. His small medical school was officially opened in December 1881. The structure of the school mirrored that of western schools, with textbooks, exams, and papers. MacKenzie took a break from China in 1883 for five months to return to England to visit his wife and daughter who had moved back after Ms. MacKenzie's health continued to decline. When he returned, six students graduated from the Tientsin Medical School in 1884 after three years of study. MacKenzie withdrew from being involved in the medical school because he didn't want to spend his time raising pupils up to be Government workers. Late life In the autumn of 1886, it was decided that all of the medical missionaries in China should come together and form a society called the Medical Missionary Association of China. MacKenzie was a prominent part in organising this society and also helped edit the society's journal entitled, Medical Missionary Journal. He contributed to the journal a few times. He died on Easter Day, 1888 from smallpox contracted from a patient.

It was a medium-sized mosasaur, reaching up to in length. Discovery and naming aigialosaur-style limbs The holotype (MTM 2011.43.1) and referred specimens have been collected from the alluvial sediments of the Csehb√°nya Formation from various exposures at the Ihark√∫t open-pit bauxite mine, Bakony Hills, Western Hungary since the discovery of the locality in 2000. A single vertebra has been collected in 1999 from the Ajka Coal Formation at the waste dump of the coal mines next to the town of Ajka, 20 km from Ihark√∫t. Currently more than one hundred bones of Pannoniasaurus, sourced from a large number of individuals of differing age classes, are known from the alluvial flood-plain deposits that comprise the Csehb√°nya Formation. All specimens of Pannoniasaurus are currently housed in the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, Hungary. Description Holotype quadrate (MTM 2011.43.1) of Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus Pannoniasaurus was a medium-sized mosasauroid, estimated to grow up to a maximum of in length. It exhibited a combination of primitive characteristics, such as having no predental rostrum, the premaxilla-maxilla suture ends anterior to or level with the midline of the fourth maxillary tooth, a nearly straight frontoparietal suture, and a shallow quadrate alar concavity. It also had elongated stapedial pit that was at least three times longer than it was wide. Tethysaurus is the type genus, as it is the best-represented genus of the subfamily, known from multiple partial skeletons. Thus the subfamily name derives from the name of its type genus. Pannoniasaurus is known from various material, including 2 isolated premaxillae, 3 maxillae, 2 postorbitofrontals, 2 quadrates, 3 dentaries, 3 splenials, 3 angulars, a coronoid, 2 surangulars, an articular, 91 isolated teeth, 20 cervical, 40 dorsal, 4 sacral, and 18 caudal vertebrae, 34 vertebral fragments, 3 ribs, 2 humeral fragments, and 4 ilia. Since all remains are isolated bones, the basis for the referral of this material to Pannoniasaurus is based on similar methods used by other authors, such as Houssaye et al. in their study of Pachyvaranus crassispondylus in 2011. The paratypes are known by MTM V.01.115, a left quadrate, and MTM 2007.31.1, a fragmentary left quadrate. Though all remains (including the holotype) of Pannoniasaurus are isolated bones, the density of the specimens, the various size classes, the large number of similar elements from individual animals, and their unique characters, make it possible to link them together into a single taxon. The preserved part of the maxilla bears 12 tooth sockets but the original maxillary tooth count might have been much higher. A number of isolated teeth were attributed to Pannoniasaurus that are similar to Halisaurus, being conical and curved posterolingually, bear crowns with fine anastomosing longitudinal striae, and have a strong mesial but weaker labiodistal carina. A single vertebra of Pannoniasaurus (MTM V.2000.21), as well as a variety of fish and crocodile teeth, were collected from the waste dump of the subterranean Ajka coal mine. The Ajka Coal Formation interdigitates with the Csehb√°nya Formation, the depositional environment of the latter was a floodplain, while the Ajka Coal Formation was formed in the accumulation basin of the same river system. Both of these facies were formed in the same paleogeographic area, which itself might have been part of a larger, but isolated landmass. Classification Phylogenetic tree of Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus Analysis by Mak√°di et al. found three equally most parsimonious trees that placed Pannoniasaurus in a new clade, the Tethysaurinae. The three trees reconstructed Pannoniasaurus as the sister taxon to the clade that includes Tethysaurus nopcsai, Yaguarasaurus columbianus, and Russellosaurus coheni. Tethysaurinae was reconstructed at the base of a clade that includes the aigialosaurs Carsosaurus, Komensaurus, and Haasiasaurus, and the clades that include conventional marine mosasaur-grade mosasauroids such as halisaurs, tylosaurs and plioplatecarpines. The concept of a monophyletic clade of aigialosaurs from within which a polyphyletic Mosasauridae arises (two major lineages of a grade of paddle-bearing marine mosasaurs), is supported, and provides further support for the hypothesis of convergent aquatic adaptations in paddle-bearing mosasaurs. The discovery of Pannoniasaurus indicates that, similar to some lineages of cetaceans, mosasauroids quickly radiated into a variety of aquatic environments, with some groups reinvading available niches in freshwater habitats, and becoming highly specialized within those ecosystems. Paleobiology Geochemical and isotopic data are most compatible with Pannoniasaurus having lived in a predominantly freshwater ecosystem, and evidence suggests strongly that Pannoniasaurus was not a seasonal migrant from marine waters into fresh, but rather that ecologically it was a permanent member of a freshwater fauna. With the discovery and description of Pannoniasaurus, mosasauroid evolution is now understood as also having involved important and unsuspected adaptations to freshwater ecosystems. The size of Pannoniasaurus makes it the largest known predator in the waters of this paleoenvironment. Additionally, the crocodile- like flattened skull (as indicated by the premaxilla and maxilla) was a useful adaptation for water-level ambush hunting of terrestrial and shallow water prey. Limbs Size of Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus compared to human It is difficult to estimate how the unknown girdle and limb elements of Pannonisasaurus may have looked. It had a primitive vertebral column, a posteriorly oriented ilium and an elongated humerus with a distal epiphysis, all most similar to aigialosaurs. These suggest that P. inexpectatus had an overall aigialosaur-like postcranial morphology (including plesiopelvia and plesiopedia). However, Dallasaurus, for example, has an anteriorly oriented, hydropelvic ilium in combination with primitive-looking proximal limb elements, and therefore a flattened, derived distal limb morphology is not entirely impossible for that taxon. For Pannoniasaurus a primitive morphology of the complete limbs in correlation with the primitive axial skeleton and pelvis is more probable, but far from certain. It is possible that the retention of a robust sacrum, pelvis and possibly non-paddle-like limbs were used to help to propel the body forward from the bottom during prey-capture in shallow water, similar to extant crocodiles.

Members of the subfamily are informally and collectively known as \\"tethysaurines\\" and have been recovered from North America and Africa. Only two tethysaurine genera are known, Pannoniasaurus and Tethysaurus. The genera Yaguarasaurus and Russellosaurus were previously considered tethysaurines until they were grouped with Romeosaurus in the new subfamily Yaguarasaurinae. A possible member of this clade (subfamily) is a mosasaur specimen known from a maxilla fragment, found in 1960 in the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), in Doln√≠ √öjezd near Litomy≈°l.https://dinosaurusblog.com/2020/04/14/morsky-drak-od-litomysle/ Like the closely related yaguarasaurines, all tethysaurines were plesiopedal (meaning primitive and not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs). They generally retained relatively small sizes compared to later giant mosasaurs. The tethysaurines appeared during the Turonian and went extinct in the Santonian, possibly outcompeted by more derived mosasaurs. The etymology of this group derives from the genus Tethysaurus (Tethys from the Greek goddess of the sea and sauros, Greek for \\"lizard\\").  Description  The known skeletal remains and a skeletal restoration of Pannoniasaurus. Tethysaurines were primitive and comparatively small to medium-sized mosasaurs that lived during the earlier stages of mosasaur evolutionary history. Tethysaurus itself is approximately 3 metres long, whilst Pannoniasaurus might have reached lengths of 6 metres. They had a plesiopedal limb condition, meaning that they were not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs and probably kept to shallow bodies of water. Pannoniasaurus is the only known mosasaur recovered from freshwater deposits. Mak√°di et al. (2012) originally diagnosed the Tethysaurinae as all mosasaurs descended from the recentmost common ancestor of Tethysaurus nopscai and Russellosaurus coheni. By this definition, the Yaguarasaurinae would be sunk into this subfamily since Russellosaurus is now considered a yaguarasaurine. Unambiguous character states were listed as follows: \\"predental rostrum absent; premaxilla-maxilla suture ends anterior to or level with the midline of the fourth maxillary tooth; nearly straight frontoparietal suture; quadrate alar concavity shallow; elongated stapedial pit (at least three times longer than wide); quadrate distal condyle saddle-shaped, upward deflection of quadrate distal condyle absent; mandibular glenoid formed mainly by articular; cervical synapophyses extend below ventral border of centrum; dorsoventrally compressed centra in precaudal vertebrae; two sacrals with large ribs/transverse processes subcircular/oval in cross-section; facet for ilium on tip of sacral transverse processes; very elongated (two times longer than wide) pontosaur-like caudal centra; anteroposteriorly narrow scapula; ilium with posterior iliac process with compressed dorsal end bearing longitudinal grooves and ridges, and spoon- shaped preacetabular process overlapping the pubis\\".  Phylogeny  The subfamily name is derived from Tethysaurus due to Tethysaurus being the best- represented genus of the subfamily and being known from multiple partial skeletons. The original definition of the Tethysaurinae was as all mosasaurs descended from the recentmost common ancestor of Tethysaurus nopscai and Russellosaurus coheni. The cladogram below follows Mak√°di et al. (2012) and the then assumed internal relationships of the Tethysaurinae. Yaguarasaurus and Russellosaurus are today considered part of the Yaguarasaurinae instead, which is defined as the most recent common ancestor of Russellosaurus, Romeosaurus, and Yaguarasaurus, and all of its descendants.

Background The library developed from the personal collection of Johannes Poliander, who donated it to the town council of Altstadt in 1541. J. Lomoller donated 300 predominantly legal works in 1594. It was housed in Altstadt's pauper house after its construction in 1628. To it was added the collection of vice-mayor Heinrich Bartsch (1627‚Äì1702). His son, city secretary Heinrich Bartsch Jr., created a librarian position in 1714, made the collection public in 1718, and added his own Bible collection. The first librarians were Johann Jakob Quandt and Gottlieb Siegfried Bayer. The library moved from the pauper house to the Altstadt Latin school in 1737 and then to the Altstadt Town Hall in 1773. In 1810 it moved to the K√∂nigshaus in Neue Sorge, which also housed the royal and university libraries at the same time. Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger donated another collection in 1837. Into the 20th Century By the second half of the 19th century, the public library was disorganized and in financial difficulties. It moved to the old campus of the University of K√∂nigsberg in Kneiphof in 1875 and was administered by August Wittich from 1875 to 1897. The councilor August Wilhelm Hensche donated his private collection in 1889. When the magistrate considered closing the library, Wittich focused on reorganizing the library and hiring a chief librarian, Ernst Seraphim. Seraphim energetically developed the library after Wittich's 1897 death and had the library rebuilt. Rudolf Reicke donated 2,150 volumes to the library in 1907. Two years later Seraphim and the library began publishing seven volumes of scientific publications with the title Mitteilungen. Directors and destruction Directors of the library included pastor Michael Lilienthal (1728 to 1748), Christian Jakob Kraus (1786 to 1804), Friedrich Adolf Meckelburg (1844 to 1875), August Wittich (1875 to 1897), Ernst Seraphim (from 1900), Christian Krollmann (from 1923), and Fritz Gause (from 1938).

The \\"firewall\\" phenomenon was proposed in 2012 by physicists Ahmed Almheiri, Donald Marolf, Joseph Polchinski, and James Sully as a possible solution to an apparent inconsistency in black hole complementarity. The proposal is sometimes referred to as the AMPS firewall,Borun D. Chowdhury, Andrea Puhm, \\"Decoherence and the fate of an infalling wave packet: Is Alice burning or fuzzing?\\", Phys. Rev. D 88, 063509 (2013) an acronym for the names of the authors of the 2012 paper. The use of a firewall to resolve this inconsistency remains controversial, with high-energy physicists divided as to the solution to the paradox.Astrophysics: Fire in the hole! The motivating paradox According to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, a single emission of Hawking radiation involves two mutually entangled particles. The outgoing particle escapes and is emitted as a quantum of Hawking radiation; the infalling particle is swallowed by the black hole. Assume a black hole formed a finite time in the past and will fully evaporate away in some finite time in the future. Then, it will only emit a finite amount of information encoded within its Hawking radiation. Assume that at time t, more than half of the information had already been emitted. According to widely accepted research by physicists like Don Page and Leonard Susskind, an outgoing particle emitted at time t must be entangled with all the Hawking radiation the black hole has previously emitted. This creates a paradox: a principle called \\"monogamy of entanglement\\" requires that, like any quantum system, the outgoing particle cannot be fully entangled with two independent systems at the same time; yet here the outgoing particle appears to be entangled with both the infalling particle and, independently, with past Hawking radiation. In order to resolve the paradox, physicists may eventually be forced to give up one of three time-tested theories: Einstein's equivalence principle, unitarity, or existing quantum field theory. Originally published in Quanta, December 21, 2012. The \\"firewall\\" resolution to the paradox Some scientists suggest that the entanglement must somehow get immediately broken between the infalling particle and the outgoing particle. Breaking this entanglement would release large amounts of energy, thus creating a searing \\"black hole firewall\\" at the black hole event horizon. This resolution requires a violation of Einstein's equivalence principle, which states that free-falling is indistinguishable from floating in empty space. This violation has been characterized as \\"outrageous\\"; one theorist has complained that \\"a firewall simply can't appear in empty space, any more than a brick wall can suddenly appear in an empty field and smack you in the face.\\"  Non-firewall resolutions to the paradox  Some scientists suggest that there is in fact no entanglement between the emitted particle and previous Hawking radiation. This resolution would require black hole information loss, a controversial violation of unitarity. Others, such as Steve Giddings, suggest modifying quantum field theory so that entanglement would be gradually lost as the outgoing and infalling particles separate, resulting in a more gradual release of energy inside the black hole, and consequently no firewall. Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind have suggested in ER=EPR that the outgoing and infalling particles are somehow connected by wormholes, and therefore are not independent systems; however, , this hypothesis is still a \\"work in progress\\". The fuzzball picture resolves the dilemma by replacing the 'no-hair' vacuum with a stringy quantum state, thus explicitly coupling any outgoing Hawking radiation with the formation history of the black hole.S. Mathur (2009). \\"The information paradox: A pedagogical introduction\\", Class. Quantum Grav., Vol. 26 No. 22 (2009)Steven G. Avery, Borun D. Chowdhury, Andrea Puhm, \\"Unitarity and fuzzball complementarity: 'Alice fuzzes but may not even know it!'\\", JHEP 09 (2013) 012 Stephen Hawking received widespread mainstream media coverage in January 2014 with an informal proposal to replace the event horizon of a black hole with an \\"apparent horizon\\" where infalling matter is suspended and then released; however, some scientists have expressed confusion about what precisely is being proposed and how the proposal would solve the paradox. Characteristics and detection The firewall would exist at the black hole's event horizon, and would be invisible to observers outside the event horizon. Matter passing through the event horizon into the black hole would immediately be \\"burned to a crisp\\" by an arbitrarily hot \\"seething maelstrom of particles\\" at the firewall. In a merger of two black holes, the characteristics of a firewall (if any) may leave a mark on the outgoing gravitational radiation as \\"echoes\\" when waves bounce in the vicinity of the fuzzy event horizon. The expected quantity of such echoes is theoretically unclear, as physicists don't currently have a good physical model of firewalls. In 2016, cosmologist Niayesh Afshordi and others argued there were tentative signs of some such echo in the data from the first black hole merger detected by LIGO; more recent work has argued there is no statistically significant evidence for such echoes in the data.

The area began to develop as a commercial center during the last decades of the twentieth century, basically with the advent of supermarkets, shops and some restaurants whose owners are Chinese. Description The Paseo de los Estudiantes area is located in the southern part of the city on 9th Street between 2nd Avenue and 18th Avenue, beginning at the Iglesias de La Soledad and culminating in the facilities of Liceo de Costa Rica. It is named in honor of high school students from Liceo de Costa Rica, the Colegio Superior de Se√±oritas and Colegio Seminario de San Jos√© who opposed the dictatorship of Federico Tinoco Granados (1917-1919), who made the square located in front of the church the center of their protests. In 2012, the Municipality of San Jose built a Barrio Chino (Chinatown) on the same site, the first of its kind in Central America, with the aim of reviving the capital's trade, although the name Paseo de los Estudiantes is still used interchangeably. On April 28, 2016, a monument to student civic movement of 1919, the work of Costa Rican sculptor Edgar Zuniga opened. Culture Barrio Chino de San Jos√© The Chinatown was officially opened on Wednesday 5 December 2012, after nearly ten months of work, with funding from the government of China to promote friendship between the two countries. It is expected to become a new area of touristic interest in the city. Works began in February 2012, but the planning and design began in 2009 as a result of political negotiations between the governments of Costa Rica and the People‚Äôs Republic of China, to create a neighborhood in San Jose to represent Chinese culture. After a little discussion about the most appropriate location and that have the least impact on traffic flow, they chose the central 9th street, popularly known as \\"Paseo de los Estudiantes\\" (\\"Students Walkway\\"). The area includes the square of the Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de La Soledad (Church of Solitude) and a little music amphitheater. The neighborhood is an area of about 550 meters long and 8200 meters¬≤ building, in an area of twelve city blocks between 2nd Avenue and 14th Avenue (north to south) and between 7th and 11th Street (in west to east direction). The central axis constitutes a boulevard or stamped concrete walkway in red and yellow colors (symbolizing good luck and prosperity respectively in Chinese culture), along 9th Street. Undoubtedly, its most notable architectural work is the arched entrance, similar to others located in other cities around the world. The work was performed by employees of a Chinese company, linked to the Beijing Bureau of Antiquities and is estimated to cost approximately $500,000. The bow is made of reinforced concrete, is 10 meters high and 15 wide, with enough internal space for a firetruck to pass, in case of emergency. Although inspired by the Tang Dynasty, is also integrated eight areas of concrete spheres symbolize existing Pre-Columbian art of Costa Rica, as a way to symbolize the union of cultures. The boulevard ends at 14th Avenue with a statue of Confucius in human size, located on a small pedestal. Although it was initially announced that it would build a second arc at the end of the boulevard (with the support of the Chinese community in Costa Rica), this was finally dismissed for reasons that were disclosed. The works also involved a new sewer and installation of underground electrical wiring. Initially, the work was estimated at a cost of around CRC 600 million colones (just over a million US dollars). He said that this work was done with the donation of $1 million provided by the government of China, and ¬¢200 million from the Municipality of San Jos√©. Finally, although precise figures were not provided, the total cost of the buildings is estimated between $1.5 and $2 million, contributed mainly by the Chinese government. The creation of this area was controversial from the very beginning. One common criticism was the comparatively low presence of Asian property owners in that area of the city, despite the fairly significant concentration of local citizens of Asian origin. However, the Asian population remains mixed with Costa Ricans, who are the majority. This trend is expected to change over time. Another point of contention was the creation of the neighborhood on a street popularly known as \\"Paseo de los Estudiantes\\" (Students' Walk), which begins at the emblematic Church of Our Lady of Solitude. Some conservatives questioned whether the project promoted disrespect for the character and religious traditions that have been rooted in the church for more than a century. Furthermore, the original street name has historical significance to Costa Ricans, because it refers to students of Liceo de Costa Rica who fought against dictatorship and corruption. The name also refers to the daily transit of thousands of young people on their way to their schools for over a hundred years. A final point of contention was the impact on the road network of the city, which was already swamped with traffic. 9th Street was an important artery of transportation to the southern end of the capital, and its absence has caused an increased traffic in the surrounding streets, especially during rush hour.

Each of four virtual orators displays a black and white animation from a contemporary mass uprising: Tank Man near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989; the assassination of Neda Agha-Soltan, who was gunned down in the streets of Tehran during the 2009 Iranian election protests; scenes from Tahrir Square in Cairo during the 2011 Arab Spring; and the 2011 Occupy Wall Street uprising. Each of these images is juxtaposed, in montage, with frames from the Odessa Steps scene of Sergei Eisenstein‚Äòs historic Battleship Potemkin film. When touched, the virtual objects play sound from the uprising. The stands call up both the resurgence and nostalgia of current worldwide political idealism as they re-imagine the museum plaza in the function of the public square. Commissioned by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Artists Respond program, Orators, Rostrums, and Propaganda Stands has also been exhibited at Kunsthallen Nikolaj, as part of the Conversations exhibition during the 2012 Copenhagen Art Festival and at Triennale di Milano in Milan, Italy, as part of the No Need for Real exhibition in 2012.

In 1976, the Marion County Engineer decided to remove the bridge from its original location in order to build a new bridge at its original location. Instead of destroying it, the engineer's office moved it to Caledonia, where village officials arranged for its placement across the Olentangy River in order to provide access to a community park. Four years later, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in Ohio's history and as an example of historically important methods of construction.

Its name honored Albert I, Duke of Prussia (1490‚Äì1568), an early supporter of Lutheranism. By the early 20th century, the churches of Tragheim and Neurossgarten were too far away for the growing population of K√∂nigsberg's Maraunenhof quarter, so a new church was planned in 1908 at Maraunenhof's K√∂nig-Ottokar-Platz. Construction of the Neo-Romanesque building, designed by the architects H. Mattar and E. Scheler, began on 19 May 1911, with its dedication as the New Tragheim Church (Neuer Tragheimer Kirche) occurring on 12 January 1913. It became known as the Maraunenhof Church (Maraunenhofer Kirche) in 1928 when the parish became independent from Tragheim. It was also sometimes known as the K√∂nig-Ottokar-Kirche, after King Ottokar II of Bohemia, namesake of the city and nearby square. In 1933 during celebrations of the 450th anniversary of the birth of Martin Luther, the church was renamed the Herzog-Albrecht-Ged√§chtniskirche zu K√∂nigsberg-Maraunenhof. The interior of the church held life-size bronze figures of Saints John and Paul. The wooden crucifix was created by Georg Grasegger. The memorial church was heavily damaged during the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. The Soviet administration in Kaliningrad demolished its remnants in 1972. The rectory was maintained, however, and was used first as a movie theatre and now as a children's music school named after E. T. A. Hoffmann.

She began her work by setting up a dispensary in Kwai Ping, then continued by working with the Canton Hospital. Dr. Fulton set up a college to train women in medicine, the Hackett Medical College for Women, and served as the dean there. In addition, she preached the Presbyterian faith and ultimately began a multi-denominational Christian congregation in Shanghai. There she also translated English medical volumes into Chinese. She died in Pasadena, California at the age of 72.  Early life and education  Mary Hannah Fulton was born in Ashland, Ohio on May 31, 1854. She was born to John. S Fulton, a native Pennsylvanian and prominent attorney in Ohio, and Augusta Louise Fulton, a native of Seneca, New York. Her parents moved to Ashland in 1840, and her father was a prominent attorney there. Fulton had two brothers; Reverend Albert Andrew Fulton and Harmon H. Fulton. Fulton attended Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, where she completed her freshman and sophomore years. She completed her education and received her B.S. degree in 1874 at Hillsdale College, and then received her M.S. degree in 1877 from the same college. After teaching in the public schools of Indianapolis, Indiana for three years, Fulton entered the Woman‚Äôs Medical College of Pennsylvania, which was noted for training medical missionaries. She graduated in the spring of 1884. Her graduation thesis was written on the topic of Elephantiasis Gracecorum-leprosy, a disease especially common in central and southern China.James and Sicherman 1971, p. 685. Early work in China Work in the Guangxi Province The Presbyterian Church began their missionary missions to China in 1838.Barr 2012, p. 6. Fulton was appointed as a missionary to South China in May 1884 by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. Upon arrival, Fulton joined her brother and his wife in their quest to evangelize China. Together, they set up an outpost in Kwai Ping in the Guangxi province, an anti-foreigner region where no missionaries had previously ventured. Mary Fulton rented two rooms in a mud house that served as a dispensary for medication and a treatment room, while Albert Fulton preached and his wife opened a school for girls. In order to communicate with the locals, Fulton hired an assistant, Mrs. Mei Yagui, who had trained at the Canton Hospital, to serve as her translator and assistant. By 1886, Mary and Albert Fulton had succeeded in raising the funds necessary to build a new hospital building. However, before the opening, a violent gang attacked the missionary outpost, incited by Confucian scholars who were against the mutilation of human bodies for the sake of medicine. The missionaries escaped without serious injury, but never again returned to Kwai Ping.Guangqui 2011, p. 140. In the same year, the Medical Missionary Association of China was founded in Shanghai. Fulton was admitted as one of the original thirty-four members.Wong 1973, p. 114. Canton Hospital Birds Eye view of the Canton Hospital, in Guangzhou, China. Fulton continued her work at the Canton Hospital, which was started by Dr. Peter Parker in 1835 and run by John G Kerr. The Canton Hospital, a treatment and training facility, also ran dispensaries in the area. In 1888, Fulton opened a dispensary for women near the hospital. In 1891, she opened another dispensary for women with the help of Dr. Mary Niles. She used these dispensaries to provide medical treatment to villagers who were not able to travel to the hospital.Guangqui 2011, p. 143. Fulton performed medical services ranging from regular treatment to common surgical operations free of charge to those who could not pay. When patients insisted on paying her, citing Chinese tradition, she used the gifts to support the patients‚Äô families, and cash was contributed to the hospital. In 1879, John G. Kerr admitted two women to the training program at the Canton Hospital. By 1888 there were 37 female pupils training at the hospital. In 1897, Fulton resumed responsibility for the women‚Äôs work of the hospital. When Kerr resigned from the hospital in 1898, no provisions were made for the female students. Fulton began collecting funds at once to set up training for women medical professionals.Chen 2004. Hackett Medical College for Women Necessity for a women‚Äôs college Due to the strict social etiquette in China that forbade physical contact between men and women, women were reluctant to consult doctors or receive medical treatment. A male practitioner could not even put a finger on a female‚Äôs wrist to feel a pulse; women pointed to a figurine to show where their pain was instead of point to a body part or removing pieces of clothing.Lovejoy 1937, p. 231. Therefore, there was a high demand for female medical professionals who would be able to treat women and girls. Facilities Fulton opened her first training facility, called the Kwangtung Medical School for Women, in 1901. It was housed on the ground floor of the Theodore Cuyler First Presbyterian Church in the western suburbs of Canton and consisted of 11 female students. The building was not sufficient as the students were forced to have their meals in the outpatient room.Guangqui 2011, p. 174. With three thousand dollars raised by the Fulton and Presbyterian mission, a special hospital for women and children, called the David Gregg Hospital, was built as a teaching facility for the school. Theodore Cuyler and David Gregg were pastors of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, which commissioned and underwrote much of Fulton's work in China. Archives of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, New York In 1903, Mr E A Hackett donated enough money to build a special building to house the college, and it was renamed the Hackett Medical College for Women. Three years later, in 1906, another gift from Hackett allowed a second building to be built to house lecture and laboratory rooms. The first building became dorms. Fulton‚Äôs impact The goal of the college was to distribute Christianity and modern medicine, as well as to elevate the social status of women in China. With Fulton‚Äôs recommendation, the curriculum was taught in Cantonese in order to train women to be most effective to the surrounding areas and provide them with greater professional opportunities. The curriculum included attending clinics, helping to lance boils, and practical assistance in childcare and delivering babies. Graduates were instantly employed at mission hospitals and several government institutions.Guangqui 2011, p. 201. Under Fulton‚Äôs guidance, Hackett College provided free medical services to the poor. The women who were trained at the Hackett College were considered fine educated women, and thus highly demanded as wives for the upper class. Therefore, Fulton made a strict restriction that women set to be married were prohibited from studying there. Fulton remained dean of the college for 16 years. Retirement to Shanghai At the request of the Medical Missionary Association of China, Fulton moved to Shanghai in 1915 to commence the translation of medical books.Wong 1973. She presented the Publication Committee of the Chinese Medical Society with a supply of her translation, which included Dr. Anna M. Fullerton‚Äôs ‚ÄúNursing in Abdominal Surgery and Disease of Women‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúDiseases of Children‚Äù and ‚ÄúNursing in Abdominal Surgery‚Äù. Many Chinese general practitioners and medical teachers adopted her Cantonese translations of important English-language textbooks on general and surgical nursing. In Shanghai, Fulton organized an independent congregation that included nine denominations. She raised money to build the Cantonese Union Church of Shanghai, also called the Augusta Fulton Memorial Church in memory of her mother. This became the center for Christian activities in Shanghai.James and Sicherman 1971, p. 686. Death In May 1918, poor health forced Fulton to return to the United States. She died in Pasadena, California at the age of 72, and was buried in the Inglewood Cemetery in California. Her death was attributed to cardiac decomposition, the result of chronic asthma.

Biography Pikler received his musical training in his native Budapest, first under Eugene Ormandy, then at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, principally under N√°ndor Zsolt and Jen≈ë Hubay. As a violinist he toured extensively in Central Europe, prior to taking his own orchestra to India in 1934. For the next eight years he appeared as director of the orchestra and as soloist in important concert and radio work in the Far East. In 1946, following three years of internment in a Japanese camp during World War II, he took up residence in Sydney. The same year, he became leader of the original Musica Viva Chamber Music Players founded by Richard Goldner, giving concerts throughout Australia and New Zealand.Borer, p. 130 In 1952 he accepted the invitation from Sir Eugene Goossens to become the principal viola of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, a position he filled with great distinction for 14 years. Meanwhile, chamber music occupied much of his time outside orchestral duties. During a four-month absence from Australia in 1962, he visited the United States, England, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Hungary and Austria. Leaving the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1966, he became Artistic Director and viola player for the Sydney String Quartet. At the same time he began teaching at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music. The Sydney Conservatorium Chamber Orchestra which he founded in 1966 was the first Australian ensemble to undertake a tour of South East Asia on behalf of the Department of External Affairs. Pikler received the Britannica Award in 1972 for his services to Australian music and in 1974 was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He died in 1984, shortly before turning 75. In 1980 he made various recordings devoted to Leopold Stokowski's orchestral arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach as conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

Its territory is now part of the Leningradsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History The estate Maraunenhof, originally Maraunen, was located in the forest west of the Oberteich and north of Tragheim since 1571.Gause II, p. 405 It was named after an Old Prussian farmer named Maraun, who acquired the land from L√∂benicht in 1605.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 95 In 1651 it was reacquired by L√∂benicht.Albinus, p. 209 In 1798 it was documented as the Gasthaus Maraunenhof. Part of the estate of Maraunenhof was transferred from the rural district of K√∂nigsberg (Landkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.) into the city of K√∂nigsberg (Stadtkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr) on 1 April 1905, with the remainder following on 10 June 1927. A break was made in K√∂nigsberg's city walls near the Wrangel Tower (Wrangelturm) in 1906 to allow construction of a road north through Tragheimsdorf to Maraunenhof. The K√∂nigsberger Terrain- Aktiengesellschaft Oberteich-Marauenhof, a private development company, built Maraunenhof into a suburb of upper class villas along the northern shore of the Oberteich ca. 1911.Gause II, p. 652 Parks in Maraunenhof included Max- Aschmann-Park, named after the merchant Max Aschmann,Albinus, p. 94 and the scenic Stadtg√§rtnerei, established by Garden Inspector Paul K√§ber (1869-1919). The quarter's mostly Protestant residents attended the Herzog-Albrecht- Ged√§chtniskirche at K√∂nig-Ottokar-platz, named after King Ottokar II of Bohemia; in 1934 the square was renamed Herzog-Albrecht-Platz after Albert, Duke of Prussia. In 1935 a military hospital was opened near Max-Aschmann-Park for K√∂nigsberg's garrison. The quarter Tragheimer Palve developed just west of Maraunenhof. The football club VfB K√∂nigsberg played its home games at the Sportplatz des Vereins f√ºr Bewegungs Spiele near the Stadtg√§rtnerei, aside from 1940-41 when they played at the Sportplatz am Friedl√§nder Tor between Haberberg and Rosenau.

Individually-performed, chiefly but not exclusively by women, dancers move by throwing or thrusting their hips back or shaking their buttocks, often in a low squatting stance. Twerking is part of a larger set of characteristic moves unique to the New Orleans style of hip-hop known as \\"bounce\\". Moves include \\"mixing\\", \\"exercising\\", the \\"bend over\\", the \\"shoulder hustle\\", \\"clapping\\", \\"booty clapping\\", \\"booty poppin\\", and \\"the wild wood\\"‚Äîall recognized as \\"booty shaking\\" or \\"bounce\\". Twerking is but one choreographic gesture within bounce. As a tradition shaped by local aid and pleasure clubs, block parties and second lines, the dance was central to \\"a historical situating of sissy bounce‚Äîbounce music as performed by artists from the New Orleans African-American community that [led to] a meteoric rise in popularity post-.\\" In the 90s, twerking had widespread appeal in black party culture throughout the hip-hop/rap region known as The Dirty South, including New Orleans, Memphis, Virginia Beach, Miami, Atlanta, and Houston. In 2013, it became the top \\"What is\\" search on the Google search engine. (video) Backup dancers twerking at a Pharrell Williams concert in Japan, 2015 Etymology The Oxford English Dictionary defines an 18th-century use of the word as a blend of \\"twist\\" and \\"jerk\\", which was reported by the BBC in conjunction with the black cultural context, but this seems to be an erroneous connection or a false cognate. The Oxford Dictionaries blog states, \\"the most likely theory is that it is an alteration of work, because that word has a history of being used in similar ways, with dancers being encouraged to \\"work it\\". Local bounce practitioners attribute the term to a contraction of \\"to work\\" or \\"twerk\\". Background The earliest use of the word \\"twerk\\" on record was the 1993 song ‚ÄùDo the Jubilee All‚Äù by DJ Jubilee.https://www.nola.com/300/2018/05/dj_jubilee_bounce_new_orleans.html The word specifically originated from the inner-city of New Orleans and was used frequently in New Orleans Bounce music by rappers and DJ hosting block parties in the housing projects. The word became popular in the 2000s, when it was used by Atlanta rapper Lil Jon and The East side Boys. A Google Trends search reveals that interest in the word \\"twerk\\" arose in November 2011. The diffusion of the dance phenomenon began earlier via local parties and eventually strip clubs often associated with mainstream rap music and video production aired by video cable television shows, that featured rap music and R&B; music. Popular video-sharing channels such as YouTube amplified interest since the advent of digital social media platforms. In 2013, the dance became a viral sensation beyond black culture. Miley Cyrus used the dance in a video that was uploaded first on Facebook and then YouTube in March. Though twerking began trending as a web search in November 2011, and despite its origins in the bounce culture of New Orleans in the late 1980s, the word twerk would be added to the Oxford Dictionary Online and attributed to Cyrus following her appearance at the MTV VMA Awards in August 2013. It became the number one \\"What is\\" Google search that year as those outside the culture questioned the popularity of the dance. The word was a runner-up to \\"selfie\\" in the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2013.  Linked to Africa and the African diaspora  Historically and currently, similar styles of booty-shaking are found throughout the continent of Africa as well as the African diaspora. Similar styles of dance are known as mapouka in Ivory Coast, leumbeul in Senegal, Ditolobonya, a dance in the Sesotho language of South Africa and other styles can be found in Tanzania, Southeast Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya to name a few. This style of pelvic- and hip-isolated dancing is known as perreo or sandungueo associated with Reggaeton from Puerto Rico. Twerking can be said to be indirectly linked to African cultural dancing without any direct connections between people from Africa. Without knowledge of its historical or cultural roots in New Orleans and links to a diaspora of styles of dance, the trend was discussed in ahistorical ways. Twerking has been linked to the dance \\"Whining\\" which is defined as \\"Thrusting or rotating of the pelvic girdle in a rhythmic pattern.\\" In the recording industry  First time on record  The word \\"twerking\\" first appeared on record in \\"Do the Jubilee All\\" by DJ Jubilee in 1993, in which he chanted, \\"Twerk baby, twerk baby, twerk, twerk, twerk.\\"  Rise to national attention  Twerking first received national recognition in the United States in the early 2000s, when the song \\"Whistle While You Twurk\\" (2000), by Southern hip hop duo Ying Yang Twins, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs component chart. It was later referenced in their later track \\"Say I Yi Yi\\" (2002), in which the lyrics \\"she got her hands up on her knees and her elbows on her thighs / she like to twerk and that's for certain I can tell that she fly\\" are heard. In Silkk The Shocker's 2001 Song \\"That's Cool\\", which reached number 8 in the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs the chorus features the line \\"Somebody that's off the chain / who could twerk that thang\\". The first mainstream artist to use the word in a song occurred in 2001 when American recording girl group Destiny‚Äôs Child in the song Jumpin‚Äô, Jumpin‚Äô.  Billboard charts  In 2006, the song \\"Pop, Lock & Drop It\\", by American rapper Huey, reached number six on the US Billboard Hot 100. Also in 2006, the hit single \\"SexyBack\\", by American pop singer Justin Timberlake, featuring Timbaland, from the former's second studio album Futuresex/Lovesounds, featured Timbaland rapping the lyrics \\"Let me see what you're twerking with / Go ahead, be gone with it, Look at those hips\\". In 2014, \\"Anaconda\\" by Nicki Minaj peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, which references twerking many times. During her tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Eve Torres would twerk before performing a standing moonsault on her opponent. In November 2018, the City Girls released a song called \\"Twerk\\" featuring Cardi B which peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 29. The song is based around twerking which is great for the party scene. The lyrics to the song (\\"Twerk-twerk-twerk-twerk- twerk-twerk with her\\") is self-explanatory as to how the City Girls wanted to grab the attention of their female audience. The music video currently has over 130 million views on YouTube.  In the media  In 2011, the Twerk Team, a group of female dancers who have posted several videos of themselves twerking on YouTube, were mentioned during the song \\"Round of Applause\\" by Waka Flocka Flame featuring Drake, in the line \\"Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team\\". Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has incorporated twerking into her live shows since 2011. In July 2012, during the Workaholics episode \\"The Lord's Force\\", Anders Holm says \\"Let's just, uh, put on some twerk videos or something, right?\\". The 2012 single \\"Bandz a Make Her Dance\\" by Juicy J contains the lyric \\"Start twerking when she hear her song\\", while French Montana questions the ability of a girl to twerk by asking \\"What you twerkin' with?\\" in his 2012 single \\"Pop That\\" featuring fellow rappers Drake, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross. The aforementioned songs, along with \\"Express Yourself\\" by Nicky Da B and Diplo, \\"made twerking the most popular dance move since the Dougie\\". In March 2013, American pop singer Miley Cyrus posted a video on Facebook which featured her performing a twerking routine while wearing a unicorn suit, to the 2011 single \\"Wop\\" by J. Dash. The popularity of the video, along with parodies and responses made by fans, influenced the song's re-emergence on the Billboard Hot 100. Miley Cyrus's \\"Wop\\" video would go to become viral. By April 9, 2013, copies of the video had amassed over 4 million views on YouTube. Also in March 2013, Mollie King, an English singer- songwriter and lead vocalist of British-Irish girl group The Saturdays, was seen twerking when her bandmate Rochelle Humes uploaded the footage on YouTube. American actress and singer Vanessa Hudgens was also seen twerking in March on American late-night talk show The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In September 2013, Hudgens was later seen twerking, this time to the song \\"Bubble Butt\\", during her performance at Bootsy Bellows in West Hollywood, with her girl group YLA. Hudgens was again seen twerking in a video for Shade 45's radio show Sway in the Morning. American actress and singer Ashley Tisdale can also be seen twerking in a video for Shade 45's radio show Sway in the Morning. On July 9, 2013, a video was posted on the Twitter-owned video sharing service Vine entitled \\"Twerk Team\\", which featured a group of five women provocatively twerking to \\"Don't Drop That Thun Thun\\". The clip was shared by users over 100,000 times, and users created their own responses and parodies featuring the song, collected under the hashtags \\"#dontdropthat\\" and \\"#thunthun\\". The viral popularity of the Vine clips led to an unexpected increase in sales for the song; prior to the posting of the \\"Twerk Team\\" clip, only 4,000 copies of the song had been sold; in the following weeks, sales went up to 34,000, then to over 72,000. By late July, \\"Don't Drop That Thun Thun\\" had reached #5 on Billboard's R&B;/Hip-Hop Digital Songs chart, and it eventually peaked at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Both \\"Wop\\" and \\"Don't Drop That Thun Thun\\" have been cited as examples of how viral and user-created videos can bring renewed interest to songs; Spin writer Jordan Sargent considered \\"Wop\\" to be rap music's \\"Harlem Shake moment\\", but not a meme to the same extent as it. In April 2013, American rapper Danny Brown released the song \\"Express Yourself\\", inspired by music producer Diplo's song of the same name. The song, produced by Trampy, features a fast-paced electronic beat and is a composition about the popular dance craze twerking. Brown dedicated the song \\"to all the ladies that like to turn up and have fun,\\" in which he raps \\"Toes on the wall and her ass in the air / And she twerk that thing like she ain't have a care\\". In the music video for Barbadian singer Rihanna's single \\"Pour It Up\\", which was released in May 2013, the singer can be seen twerking. In June 2013, American rapper Busta Rhymes released a Jamaican dancehall- inspired single titled \\"Twerk It\\", featuring Nicki Minaj, who has been featured on several other \\"twerking songs\\", including \\"Shakin' It 4 Daddy\\" by Robin Thicke, \\"Dance (A$$)\\" by Big Sean and \\"Clappers\\" by Wale. Minaj can be seen twerking in all four of the aforementioned songs' respective music videos. Minaj can also be seen twerking in the music videos for American rapper Nelly's single \\"Get Like Me\\" and American singer Ciara's single \\"I'm Out\\". In August 2013, the song \\"Twerk\\", by Lil Twist, featuring pop singers Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber, was leaked online. On July 14, 2013, Showtime broadcast Season 1 Episode 3 of the series Ray Donovan, entitled \\"Twerk\\", in which actor Jon Voight's character enters a college library and pays a student to give up his computer terminal so that he can watch online videos of women twerking. A YouTube video of the scene has more than 38,000views. In August 2013, Juicy J announced via Twitter, that he would give out a $50,000 scholarship for the girl who can twerk the best. The competition is inspired by the track \\"Scholarship\\" on his third album Stay Trippy, which contains the lyric \\"Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship.\\" In early September 2013, a video titled \\"Worst Twerk Fail EVER - Girl Catches Fire!\\", began circulating around online; the video went on to become viral with over 9 million views, and received media coverage. The following week, American comedian and television host Jimmy Kimmel revealed the video was a hoax that he and his team had devised, on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In April 2014, the video won the Webby Award for best viral clip of the year. Also in September, \\"Twerk\\" from the MTV VMA show was named the Top Television Word of the Year (Teleword) of the 2012‚Äì2013 TV season by the Global Language Monitor. In October 2013, American actress Beth Behrs, of American television sitcom 2 Broke Girls, was seen twerking on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

The seventh episode of the second season of the American reality television series Bad Girls All-Star Battle, which aired February 25, 2014 and was titled \\"Twerk It Out\\", featured the contestants twerking as fast as possible with pedometers on their back. In August 2013, American recording artist Miley Cyrus, generated controversy following a sexually provocative performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, in which Cyrus twerked during a medley of her track \\"We Can't Stop\\", \\"Blurred Lines\\" and \\"Give It 2 U\\" by Robin Thicke. Cyrus also received criticism for \\"stealing\\" African American culture, also known as cultural appropriation. In August 2014, American recording artist Taylor Swift, featured twerking in the music video to her single \\"Shake It Off\\". This caused some controversy with American rapper Earl Sweatshirt saying that the video was \\"perpetuating stereotypes\\". In October 2017, Valerie Dixon who is 27 years old, was arrested in Lake County, Florida because she was twerking and speaking foul language in front of a school bus.

The estate Propsthof, in the broad Hufen region between Altstadt and Lawsken, was established by the Teutonic Knights.Gause I, p. 30 In 1533 Altstadt Church sold Propsthof to the Altstadt councilor Bernhard Betner. The estate was subsequently known as Ratshubenhof and then Ratshof; it is unknown if it was renamed in honor of Betner himself or the Altstadt town council (Rat).Gause I, p. 232 It was also known as Altst√§dtischer Ratshof to differentiate it from Kneiph√∂fischer Ratshof near Rosenau in southern K√∂nigsberg. In 1586 Ratshof was owned by Urban Rodemann. Over centuries Ratshof functioned as an iron forge, a farming estate, an upper class establishment, and a children's nursing facility.Albinus, p. 253 Also in the vicinity were the Hammerteich pond and the beloved Hammerkrug inn. In 1806 the estate was acquired by the bailiff Wendland of Kaporn, who expanded it with land from the nearby Wilky forest and converted Ratshof into a large estate in 1817. From 1843 to 1883 it was owned by the Batocki family.Gause II, p. 404 In 1849 the Hammerkrug inn was purchased by councilor Tortilowicz von Batocki- Friebe. At the end of the 19th century, Allgemeine-Wohnungs-Bauverein, a private development company, developed Ratshof into a Gartenstadt according to the garden city movement. By 1905 the growing suburb was incorporated into the city of K√∂nigsberg (Stadtkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.). In 1916 the Kunstakademie K√∂nigsberg moved from Neue Sorge to Ratshof. The quarter's stadium, Sportplatz Hammerteich, hosted the football club SpVgg ASCO K√∂nigsberg. Ratshof Church was constructed in 1937. In southern Ratshof on the northern shore of the Pregel River were the Waggonfabrik factory of L. Steinfurt, warehouses, a pulp mill, and a chemical factory.

The book was first published in the United States by Harvard University Press. The book received positive reviews, and was discussed in a dedicated issue of Politics & Society. However, reviewers described Roemer's conclusions as controversial. A General Theory of Exploitation and Class is considered part of analytical Marxism. Summary Roemer aims to \\"embed the Marxian theory of exploitation in a more general theory of exploitation which will be capable of specializing to cases other than capitalism\\", and in particular to socialism. He argues that this would make it possible to \\"propose a theory of exploitation and class for socialism which can provide a basis for a materialist political theory of socialism.\\" He also discusses the labor theory of value. Publication history A General Theory of Exploitation and Class was first published by Harvard University Press in 1982. Reception A General Theory of Exploitation and Class received positive reviews from Mrgaret Levi in the American Political Science Review and Trond Petersen in Acta Sociologica, and a mixed review from Michael A. Lebowitz in the Canadian Journal of Economics. Levi described the book as \\"extremely ambitious and important\\" but also controversial. She credited Roemer with providing an alternative to traditional ways of thinking about exploitation and class, and praised his \\"grandeur of vision\\" and \\"brilliance of argument and insight\\". However, she believed that the book also had \\"serious failings\\", noting that they had been discussed in Politics & Society, where Roemer had been criticized by the sociologist Erik Olin Wright, the philosopher Andrew Levine, and the social and political theorist Jon Elster, as well as from Levi herself. Petersen described the book as \\"a novel and controversial contribution to the Marxian theory of exploitation and class\\", noting that it had received praise from political scientists, sociologists, mathematical economists, and philosophers and that Politics & Society had devoted an entire issue to it. He believed that its results would challenge both Marxist and non-Marxist social science. However, he noted that the assumptions underlying Roemer's methodology were open to question. He compared Roemer's views to those of the sociologist Max Weber. Lebowitz wrote that Roemer employed elegant models and techniques and offered admirable discussions of many issues. However, he considered Roemer's conclusions about the Marxian theory of exploitation, and \\"the character of modern socialist states\\", controversial, and questioned Roemer's treatment of both subjects, arguing that they rested on flawed assumptions. Nevertheless, he concluded that Roemer had taken, \\"the consideration of exploitation on to a new, promising terrain.\\" A General Theory of Exploitation and Class is considered a representative work of analytical Marxism, comparable to the philosopher G. A. Cohen's Karl Marx's Theory of History (1978) and Elster's Making Sense of Marx (1985). The book is the classic reconstruction of theories of exploitation and class within analytical Marxism, and forms part of a highly influential body of work on exploitation. However, Roemer noted that after the publication of A General Theory of Exploitation and Class, several good criticisms had been made of the \\"property-relations definition of capitalist exploitation\\" he advanced in the work, and that he had revised his thinking in response. Wright and Levine, writing with the philosopher Elliott Sober, noted that Marxists tend to define classes in terms of the mechanisms by which surplus products or surplus labor is appropriated, rather than by property relations as such. They credited Roemer with presenting \\"an important dissenting view in which a property relations definition of class is defended in Marxist terms\\".

Life Murphy was the son of Francis D. Murphy, who was for upwards of thirty years head of the South of Ireland Transport of Convicts Department. Francis was born in Cork, Ireland, in 1809, and after being educated in his native city, entered at Trinity College, Dublin, as a medical student, ultimately being admitted M.R.C.S. of London. In June 1836 Dr. Murphy emigrated to Sydney, New South Wales, and was immediately nominated by the Governor Sir Richard Bourke to a position on the staff of colonial surgeons. On appointment he proceeded to take charge of a portion of the southern district in the county of Argyle, but soon afterwards being led into agricultural pursuits, he resigned his official position, and finally discontinued practice as a medical man. After leaving the Government service, Dr. Murphy purchased a considerable quantity of land at Argyle, and soon became the largest grain-grower in the district. He married in 1840 Agnes, eldest daughter of Lieutenant David Reid, R.N., of Inverary Park, N.S.W., and in 1847 went to Victoria, where he purchased a station on the Ovens river, in the Beechworth district. Dr. Murphy was returned to the partially elective Victorian Legislative Council for the Murray district at the first election which took place after the separation of Victoria from New South Wales. He was for some time Chairman of Committees, and in 1852 he sold his pastoral property and went to reside permanently in Melbourne. In 1853 he was re-elected for the Murray, and resigned the chairmanship of committees to become President of the Central Road Board, which latter position he relinquished in November 1856. He was acting Speaker in the Council during the absence, on account of illness, of Dr. (later Sir) James Frederick Palmer in March 1855. When responsible government was conceded, Murphy was elected to the first Legislative Assembly of Victoria for the Murray Boroughs, and appointed the first Speaker of the House in October 1856. To this post he was re-elected in 1859, 1861, 1864, 1866, and 1868, and held it continuously till the dissolution of Parliament on 24 January 1871, when he resigned, having in the meantime been knighted in 1860. In 1866, Sir Francis Murphy left Murray Boroughs and was returned for the Grenville electorate till 1871, when he was defeated, and was out of Parliament till the next year, when he entered the Upper House as member for the Eastern Province. Murphy was in 1861 a member of the commission on the Burke and Wills expedition, and in 1863 chairman of the league directed against further transportation. He was chairman of the National Bank of Australasia and director of other companies. Murphy was one of the three Australian commissioners tasked by the Government of New Zealand with choosing a new capital for that country. Together with Joseph Docker (New South Wales) and Ronald Campbell Gunn (Tasmania), he recommended for the capital to move from Auckland to Wellington. Murphy resigned his seat in council in 1876, and resided for some time in England. He died on 30 March 1891, at his residence, St. Kilda Road, Melbourne, and was buried in Boroondara cemetery. Family In 1840 Murphy married the daughter of Lieutenant Reid, R.N., a settler in his neighbourhood. He left six daughters and three sons, one of whom, Frank Reid Murphy, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland.

VI, 2007, p. 156 »ôi 174 circus artist, aeronautics pioneer, engineer and theatre manager of Moldavian-Romanian descent.  Life   Early life  Iordache Cuparencu (Cuparentco, in the Polish newspapers: Jordaki Kuparentko/Kupare≈Ñko, or as in his autographs - Kuparenko) was born in 1784 in the vicinity of Iasi into a wealthy family. According to Orgelbrand's Encyclopedia (1864), tired of being bullied by his brothers, he left his family in 1798, working as a decorator artist at the theatre in Iasi. Around 1800, he joined J. Kolter's French traveling circus that was performing in Moldavia at the time. During the tour he fell in love with the owner's daughter, whom he married in 1804. Cuparencu become a co-owner of the circus troupe, although the couple divorced in 1808. While touring in Poland, he fell from a height during a tightrope act and broke his leg severely. It turned out to be the end of his professional career as a stunt performer and tied him to Warsaw for the rest of his life, although he was an active entrepreneur of the circus later on.  Engineering and aeronautics career  Poster of Kuparenko's third flight in Warsaw in Polish and French (1808) Soon after a partial recovery from the accident, Cuparencu found his new venture, engineering, and experimented with constructing and piloting hot air balloons, taking inspiration from successes heard from abroad. The first two of his designs were made partly of paper; between 1806 and 1808 he flew publicly three times over Warsaw and Vilnius, rousing public interest. Despite some dangerous accidents, his flights were a commercial success, drawing large audiences and earning him recognition as an inventor. In fact, during his very first public balloon launch in June 1806, the balloon burst into flames at the height of a church tower; he saved himself by descending quickly and landing safely in Warsaw's Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie. His second flight on 6 December 1806 in Vilnius, using the same type of construction, passed without incident despite strong winds, achieving a \\"high altitude\\" and a distance of 1.5 \\"miles\\" long (which could be up to 13 km, if interpreted as contemporary Polish miles). During his third flight on 24 July 1808, which started at 8 p.m., he used a new, fully fledged balloon construction, \\"having spared no expense or effort\\", as he claimed in the event's poster. Although ticketed, the flight was also of a scientific nature, and he carried out some meteorological measurements with equipment delivered from Warsaw. The experiment showed 3,882 French feet (1,320 meters) in height and a temperature of \\"several degrees\\" [Celsius], \\"so the observer [Mr. Cuparencu] felt cold\\", while the temperature of the air near the ground was reported as 23 degrees Celsius. According to the official poster, a sample of air was planned to be taken. The flight was successful but also featured an emergency landing, as a sudden, strong wind started to tear the balloon apart only minutes after the favorable conditions that had enabled data to be collected. The balloon then began to fall and eventually ignited near the ground. Nevertheless, Cuparencu did not leave the basket and landed safely near Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Cemetery, after a flight of less than 15 minutes, with the bottom of the basket serving as a parachute. He was assisted by two French bystanders and transported in good health back to the city, much to the excitement and relief of his audience. Cuparencu and these incidents are now listed in the Guinness World Records as the first survivor of an air crash and the first successful use of a parachute in action.  Puppet theatre and other activities  One of Cuparencu's other great interests was the art of puppeteering. From 1816 he was known as a theatre owner and manager, establishing his headquarters four times in different places in Warsaw, one of them in the chambers of the National Theatre. The first of his creations was a shadow theatre, the first permanent theatre of this kind in Warsaw. He constructed and managed a mechanized puppet theatre named Pitoresque, which officially premiered in 1830 (upgraded in 1842), and was well received in the city; it was even exhibited in Paris. It also featured optical-mechanical illusions, where the visitor could witness dioramas and panoramic \\"pictures of diverse places\\". According to a 19th-century encyclopedia, \\"sunsets, sun in the midday, sundowns and nights were witnessed\\", accompanied by realistic sound effects, such as thunder and rain. Cuparencu was also a Polish army soldier since 1811, reaching the rank of a lieutenant (of the artillery); he spent the rest of his life in Poland. Among his other inventions were: * A barrel organ, consisting of 27 brass trumpets that played arranged music, including fragments from the opera Der Freisch√ºtz by Karl Maria von Weber. * During one of his ticketed exhibitions he demonstrated his repeating gun, which he described as \\"a gun that, after one loading, shoots 10 times\\". It is sometimes seen as a prototype of the machine gun. In 1808 he married for the second time with Anna Henrtietta Teiflin, the daughter of the owner of the Heca amphitheatre; he subsequently took over management of the theatre, and eventually bought it in 1821. His biography is listed in the first edition of Polish encyclopedia by Samuel Orgelbrand. Iordache Cuparencu is buried at the Orthodox Cemetery in Warsaw.

After the gunman entered the school, Soto hid her students, then the students ran from their hiding places and she died trying to shield and protect them, and has since been hailed as a hero. She is a posthumous recipient of the Presidential Citizens Medal. Plans and petitions to honor her by name via scholarships, roads, and schools were announced in late 2012 and 2013.Victoria Leigh Soto Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund. Retrieved January 11, 2013. The Stratford Town Council unanimously approved a resolution to name a school after Soto and the city of Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico, birthplace of Soto's father, is planning to name a public facility after her. Biography Soto was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Carlos Soto, a native of Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico, and Donna Fagan-Soto, of Irish-American descent. Her father worked for the Connecticut Department of Transportation as a crane operator and her mother was a nurse at Bridgeport Hospital. Her family moved to Stratford, Connecticut, and she graduated from Stratford High School in 2004. In 2008, she earned bachelor's degrees in both education and history at Eastern Connecticut State University. She then enrolled in graduate school at Southern Connecticut State University.  Death  On December 14, 2012, Soto was teaching her first grade class at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when Adam Lanza made his way into the school, and began to shoot staff and students. After killing fifteen students and two teachers in the first classroom, Lanza entered Soto's classroom. Media reports state that Soto had hidden several children in a closet, and when Lanza entered her classroom, Soto told him that the children were not there and that they were in the school gym. When several children ran from their hiding places, Lanza began shooting at the students. Soto was shot after she \\"threw herself in front of her first grade students.\\" A later police report was unable to verify this turn of events. A photograph of Soto's sister awaiting news of her sister on her cell phone was taken by Associated Press photographer Jessica Hill and widely reproduced across the globe. Some news outlets labeled the photograph \\"iconic\\" and said that it has come to symbolize the tragedy. Funeral A memorial service was held on December 15, and funeral services took place on December 19 at the Lordship Community Church. American musician and songwriter Paul Simon performed at the funeral services and sang \\"The Sound of Silence\\". On December 20, she was interred at Union Cemetery Stratford, Fairfield County, Connecticut. The Connecticut State Police honor guard saluted Soto's hearse en route. Legacy Presidential Citizens Medal In December 2012, Eastern Connecticut State University announced the creation of the Victoria Leigh Soto Endowed Memorial Scholarship Fund, awarded to students who aspire to become teachers. In December 2012, residents started a petition to rename North Parade in Stratford, Connecticut, to \\"Victoria Soto Way.\\" On December 17, 2012, the Stratford High School Class of 2003 established the \\"Victoria L. Soto Memorial Fund\\" in her honor. The fund will use the donations made to help pay for the funeral services and for the creation of a memorial at Stratford High School and a scholarship fund in the name of Soto, a former classmate who belonged to the Class of 2003. On January 14, 2013, the mayor of Stratford proposed the naming of a local school as the Victoria Soto Elementary School, with construction starting in 2013. The mayor's proposal was unanimously approved by the Stratford Town Council. The mayor also stated that a fund will be set up to accept donations from those who want to contribute to a memorial, which may include a statue of Soto. In 2013, the Victoria Soto ACERO High School, located at W 51st Street, opened in Chicago, Illinois. It was designed by Wight & Co. The Victoria Soto ACERO High School is a public, charter school with grades ranging from kindergarten to the 12th grade.Soto ACERO schools Lee Bey, Southern Exposure: The Overlooked Architecture of Chicago's South Side (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2019), p. 78, photo on p. 81. The City of Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico is planning to name a public facility after Soto, whose paternal family was originally from Puerto Rico's second-most populous city. On February 15, 2013, Soto and the other five adult teachers and administrators, who were killed, were posthumously awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal. The medal honors Americans who have performed \\"exemplary deeds of service\\" for their country or fellow citizens. The medal is commonly recognized as the government's second-highest civilian award and was presented to the families of the victims by President Barack Obama at a White House ceremony. The Nutmeg Big Brothers Big Sisters organization created the \\"Victoria Soto Volunteer Award\\" in honor of Soto, who was a former Nutmeg mentor. On April 25, 2013, Ana Robles, a Nutmeg mentor, became the first recipient of the award. In June 2013, a playground in Long Brook Park in Stratford was named the \\"Victoria Soto Memorial Playground\\" in her honor. In 2015, the Victoria Soto School was inaugurated and opened, with a ribbon cutting ceremony, in Stratford, where she attended high school. The school, which was named in her honor, served students from pre-kindergarten through second grade.

It has symbiotic relationship with termites. Described as new to science in 1979, it is found in India. The specific epithet heimii honors French mycologist Roger Heim. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) produced by the fungus are edible. Description Macroscopic features The cap has a diameter of 8 to 12.5 centimeters with a smooth, silky white surface. It is gray in the middle, and turns brownish over time. It is arched convex to flat arched (plano-convex) with a distinct hump. The edge is curved. The up to 8 millimeters wide lamellae are free, white, turns pink over time with a sawn edge. Lamellettes are available. The stem is up to 19 inches long and up to 2 inches thick, white, smooth, cylindrical, not hollow with a pronounced ring . It is extended like a root (pseudorhiza). Microscopic features The hyphae in the pulp are interwoven, thick-walled and up to 18 micrometers wide. The top layer of the hat consists of radially arranged hyphae up to 5 micrometers thick. The basidia are club-shaped, 19.5 to 21 micrometers long and 5.5 to 7 micrometers wide and have 2 to 4 sterigms . Pleurocystidia are rare, if present they are club-shaped, 46 by 18 micrometers in size. The spores are elliptical, smooth, translucent , inamyloid, and grow to 7 to 8.4 by 4.2 to 5.6 micrometers in size. There are no buckles . The spore print is pink. Ecology Like other Termitomyces species, the fungus lives symbiotically in and on termite nests. It can be found on forests as well as cocoa, oil palm and rubber tree plantations, and also in gardens, orchards and pastures where termites of the genus Odontotermes occur. It grows in groups, often with more than 300 specimens, rooted in a single termite nest that can accommodate up to 40 or more mushroom chambers. The termites literally breed the mushroom, plant mushroom gardens and use it as food. The gardens are laid out in special chambers using excrement pills containing spores. The mycelium grows through the substrate (the accumulations of feces), and after a few weeks the fungus begins to form vegetative nodules that serve as food for the termites. Distribution Termitomyces heimii is common in South Asia. Systematics and taxonomy Termitomyces heimii was first described by K. Natarajan in 1979 . He found it on the Madras University campus . The specific epithet honors the French mycologist Roger Heim . The generic name refers to the close association of the fungus with termites. Use as food For sale in a Chinese marketplace Termitomyces heimii is considered to be one of the most sought-after wild mushrooms. It is mainly collected and sold in India, China, Malaysia and Nepal.

History The Musical Clock was designed by the sculptor Fritz Tiefenthaler for the first award ceremony in 1969. It is a relief gilt iron plate with a historical music box. The left side reads \\"Schallplattenpreis Fl√∂tenuhr\\", or \\"Record prize Musical clock\\", and the right reads \\"Mozartgemeinde Wien\\", or \\"Mozart Society of Vienna\\". It was originally presented annually, but for several years has only been presented every second year. The suggestion for the design was made by the then honorary chairman of the Mozart Society, inspired by Mozart's late compositions for music boxes and mechanical organs (for example, K. 594 and 608). Until 1982, the record company was awarded a replica of the Viennese Musical Clock, while the artist was given a certificate on which was shown the Leipzig musical clock, which was the model for the Viennese version. Since the late 1980s, the tradition of awarding a replica of the clock has been dispensed with for financial reasons. From the 1990s, the artists have been rewarded directly. As part of a long-standing tradition, each prize is presented in a 'winner's concert'. Today, the original Viennese musical clock, along with the archives of the Mozart Society, reside in the Vienna City and State archives.

Early life Henry Kiliaen Van Rensselaer was born on July 25, 1744. He was the eldest son of nine children born to Col. Kiliaen Van Rensselaer (1717‚Äì1781) of the 4th Albany Regiment of Militia, by the former Ariaantie Schuyler (1720‚Äì1763). Among his siblings were brothers Philip K. Van Rensselaer and Killian K. Van Rensselaer. His paternal grandfather was Hendrick van Rensselaer, who built Fort Crailo. Military experience Burgoyne Ticonderoga Henry van Rensselaer engaged in a fierce battle near Fort Anne, acting on orders from General Philip Schuyler. He was given at least two objectives: hold the enemy at Fort Anne in order to facilitate the removal of cannon and armaments at Fort Amsterdam, to a place of safety; and assist Colonel Pierse Long with his retreat from the 1777 Battle of Ticonderoga. Colonel John Hill and his British troops pursued the Rebels of the Crown from Lake Champlain up Wood creek to a point North East of Fort Anne. As planned, Van Rensselaer met Long and his regiment from New Hampshire to assist in their retreat. Their objective was to slow British movement. They assessed a numerical advantage over the British. Meanwhile, what appeared to be an American traitor, tricked Colonel Hill into believing there were twice as many as the true amount of Rebel troops. This news may have made Hill act more cautiously than he had planned, knowing his reinforcements have not arrived and otherwise not wanting to be spotted in an unprovoked retreat. A series of retreats and advances by the Patriots and the British culminated into a two sided bombardment. Van Rensselaer led an advance on British troops when he was shot in the thigh through to his knee, shattering his femur. As he lie near the British troops, he could hear little noise. He was confident the British were in retreat as he ordered his troops to \\"Attack! ...Attack\\"! Colonel van Rensselaer is credited for this critical decision in the battle of Fort Anne, July 8, 1777. Not only were the British delayed, but forced into retreat after Van Rensselaer launched a decisive assault, spanning 2 hours of all-out battle. Nearly all munitions from both Patriots and British alike were exhausted on their opposing forces. The British were so overwhelmed, when the battle ended, they were left little choice - but to retreat and abandon several of their wounded on the field to be taken prisoner. Neither the Patriots nor the British knew their opponent's supplies were crucially low. The Patriots proceeded to Fort Anne with their prisoners, two injured and two men who gave the ultimate sacrifice for liberty; Sgt. Isaac Davis and Ens. Christopher Walcutt. Their stay at Fort Anne was short. They were looking forward to a 14-mile - seven-hour journey, munitions were nearly depleted, rain was on its way and food was in short supply. As they left they were determined in preventing the British from making use Fort Anne, it was set ablaze and Van Rensselaer's regiment placed every conceivable obstacle behind in their path by felling trees and rolling boulders into the road to hinder any British advance as the Rebels made their way to Fort Edward.

When a suspension is total, a cleric is deprived of the exercise of every function and of every ecclesiastical rite, and can also be temporarily deprived of Communion. The principal grounds on which suspension is incurred in the present discipline of the Church are found in the Decrees of the Council of Trent.  Catholic Church  The earlier mentions of the suspension come from the times of Saint Cyprian (d. 258). The clerics were deprived of the income and suspended from performing a pastor's functions for which they were ordained.  Orthodox Church  In the eastern orthodox church, the suspension is called Deposition. When a cleric is deposed, he stops serving as a member of the clergy and it's forbidden to him to continue serving as one. Deposition is performed only by the clerics holding bishop's ranks.

It states that the geometric mean of the two segments equals the altitude. Theorem and applications Construction of ‚àöp by setting q to 1 If h denotes the altitude in a right triangle and p and q the segments on the hypotenuse then the theorem can be stated as: :h=\\\\sqrt{pq} or in term of areas: :h^2=pq. AM-GM inequality The latter version yields a method to square a rectangle with ruler and compass, that is to construct a square of equal area to a given rectangle. For such a rectangle with sides p and q we denote its top left vertex with D. Now we extend the segment q to its left by p (using arc AE centered on D) and draw a half circle with endpoints A and B with the new segment p+q as its diameter. Then we erect a perpendicular line to the diameter in D that intersects the half circle in C. Due to Thales' theorem C and the diameter form a right triangle with the line segment DC as its altitude, hence DC is the side of a square with the area of the rectangle. The method also allows for the construction of square roots (see constructible number), since starting with a rectangle that has a width of 1 the constructed square will have a side length that equals the square root of the rectangle's length.*Hartmut Wellstein, Peter Kirsche: Elementargeometrie. Springer, 2009, , pp. 76-77 (German, ) The theorem can be used to provide a geometrical proof of the AM‚ÄìGM inequality in the case of two numbers. For the numbers p and q one constructs a half circle with diameter p+q. Now the altitude represents the geometric mean and the radius the arithmetic mean of the two numbers. Since the altitude is always smaller or equal to the radius, this yields the inequality.Claudi Alsina, Roger B. Nelsen: Icons of Mathematics: An Exploration of Twenty Key Images. MAA 2011, , pp. 31‚Äì32 () chord theorem: CDDE=ADDB \\\\Leftrightarrow h^2=pq The geometric mean theorem can also be thought of as a special case of the intersecting chords theorem for a circle, since the converse of Thales' theorem ensures that the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle is the diameter of its circumcircle. The converse statement is true as well. Any triangle, in which the altitude equals the geometric mean of the two line segments created by it, is a right triangle.  History  The theorem is usually attributed to Euclid (ca. 360‚Äì280 BC), who stated it as a corollary to proposition 8 in book VI of his Elements. In proposition 14 of book II Euclid gives a method for squaring a rectangle, which essentially matches the method given here. Euclid however provides a different slightly more complicated proof for the correctness of the construction rather than relying on the geometric mean theorem.Euclid: Elements, book II ‚Äì prop. 14, book VI ‚Äì prop. 8, (online copy) Proof Based on similarity Proof of theorem: The triangles \\\\triangle ADC and \\\\triangle BCD are similar, since: * consider triangles \\\\triangle ABC, \\\\triangle ACD, here we have \\\\angle ACB=\\\\angle ADC=90^\\\\circ and \\\\angle BAC=\\\\angle CAD, therefore by the AA postulate \\\\triangle ABC \\\\sim \\\\triangle ACD * further, consider triangles \\\\triangle ABC, \\\\triangle BCD, here we have \\\\angle ACB=\\\\angle BDC= 90^\\\\circ and \\\\angle ABC=\\\\angle CBD, therefore by the AA postulate \\\\triangle ABC \\\\sim \\\\triangle BCD Therefore, both triangles \\\\triangle ACD and \\\\triangle BCD are similar to \\\\triangle ABC and themselves, i.e. \\\\triangle ACD \\\\sim \\\\triangle ABC \\\\sim \\\\triangle BCD. Because of the similarity we get the following equality of ratios and its algebraic rearrangement yields the theorem:. : \\\\frac{h}{p}=\\\\frac{q}{h}\\\\,\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\,h^2=pq\\\\,\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\,h=\\\\sqrt{pq}\\\\qquad (h,p,q> 0) Proof of converse: For the converse we have a triangle \\\\triangle ABC in which h^2=pq holds and need to show that the angle at C is a right angle. Now because of h^2=pq we also have \\\\tfrac{h}{p}=\\\\tfrac{q}{h} . Together with \\\\angle ADC=\\\\angle CDB the triangles \\\\triangle ADC and \\\\triangle BDC have an angle of equal size and have corresponding pairs of legs with the same ratio. This means the triangles are similar, which yields: :\\\\angle ACB=\\\\angle ACD +\\\\angle DCB=\\\\angle ACD+(90^\\\\circ-\\\\angle DBC)=\\\\angle ACD+(90^\\\\circ-\\\\angle ACD)=90^\\\\circ Based on the Pythagorean theorem Proof with the Pythagorean theorem In the setting of the geometric mean theorem there are three right triangles \\\\triangle ABC , \\\\triangle ADC and \\\\triangle DBC , in which the Pythagorean theorem yields: :h^2=a^2-q^2, h^2=b^2-p^2 and c^2=a^2+b^2 Adding the first 2 two equations and then using the third then leads to: :2h^2=a^2+b^2-p^2-q^2=c^2-p^2-q^2=(p+q)^2-p^2-q^2=2pq. A division by two finally yields the formula of the geometric mean theorem.Ilka Agricola, Thomas Friedrich: Elementary Geometry. AMS 2008, , p. 25 () Based on dissection and rearrangement File:Geometrischer H√∂hensatzbeweis.svg Dissecting the right triangle along its altitude h yields two similar triangles, which can be augmented and arranged in two alternative ways into a larger right triangle with perpendicular sides of lengths p+h and q+h. One such arrangement requires a square of area h2 to complete it, the other a rectangle of area pq. Since both arrangements yield the same triangle, the areas of the square and the rectangle must be identical. Based on shear mappings The square of the altitude can be transformed into an rectangle of equal area with sides p and q with the help of three shear mappings (shear mappings preserve the area): Shear mappings with their associated fixed lines (dotted), starting with the original square as preimage each parallelogram displays the image of a shear mapping of the figure left of it References  External links  *Geometric Mean at Cut-the-Knot Category:Area Category:Articles containing proofs Category:Euclidean plane geometry Category:History of geometry Category:Theorems in plane geometry Category:Triangle geometry ","title":"Geometric mean theorem"},{"id":"37981518","text":"Joseph Goodall (1760‚Äì1840) was an English cleric and Provost of Eton. Joseph Goodall, engraving by Henry Edward Dawe Life He was born on 2 March 1760, in Westminster, the son of Joseph Goodall, and after attending Eton College he was elected to King's College, Cambridge in 1778. There he gained Browne's Medals in 1781 and 1782, and the Craven Scholarship in 1782. He graduated B.A. in 1783 and M.A. in 1786. In 1783 Goodall became a Fellow of King's and assistant-master at Eton. In 1801 he was appointed headmaster of the school, which kept up its numbers and reputation under him. In 1808 he became canon of Windsor on the recommendation of his friend and schoolfellow Marquess Wellesley. In 1809 he succeeded Jonathan Davies as Provost of Eton. Goodall's discipline was mild, but he is said to have been an insuperable obstacle to any innovations at Eton. In 1827 he accepted the rectory of West Ilsley, Berkshire, from the chapter of Windsor. He was also rector of Hitcham, Buckinghamshire, where Charles Goddard served as a curate. Goodall was one of those noted as a pluralist by John Wade, in his Extraordinary Black Book (1832). Death and legacy William IV once said \\"When Goodall goes I'll make [Keate] provost\\"; to which Goodall replied, \\"I could not think of 'going' before Your Majesty.\\" He died on 25 March 1840, and was buried in the College Chapel on 2 April. A statue in the College Chapel was raised to his memory by a subscription headed by the Queen Dowager. He founded a scholarship of ¬£50 a year, to be held at Oxford or Cambridge.

The book received mixed reviews. Summary Vogel examines the European and North American socialist movements' treatment of the \\"woman question.\\" She examines what contemporary North American socialist feminist authors have said about women's oppression and how it is related (or not) to class society and the capitalist mode of production. She also discusses key debates within the North American feminist movement. She argues that Marx's views on women's issues are inadequately under-developed, but that they contain insights that are useful for struggles against female oppression within capitalist class society and the capitalist mode of production. She argues that Marx's work on individual consumption, the value of labour-power and the industrial reserve army, provided a useful basis for further work on the issue of social reproduction. In contrast, Vogel finds Engels' work defective because of its utopianism and its reliance on a dual system theory of women's oppression vs. class oppression. She acknowledges, however, that the work of Engels was very influential in socialist debates despite its theoretical weaknesses. Vogel examines the socialist movement around the time of the Second International and the Russian Revolution in order to analyse what leading activists had to say. She critiques much of what was written as a conflation of utopianism, liberalism and dual systems theory. However, she does find that Vladimir Lenin's work and German SPD leader Clara Zetkin's work both represented much more pragmatic attempts to seriously address women's oppression and involvement in revolutionary activity. Vogel outlines two contradictory tendencies in the socialist debate about women's oppression - one which uses a dual systems analysis and the other which is rooted in social reproduction. She argues in favour of the social reproduction approach and elaborates her own theory of women's oppression from that perspective. Publication history The book was first published in the United States in 1983 by Rutgers University Press. It was published in the United Kingdom by Pluto Press. In 2013, the work was republished by Brill Publishers, with a new introduction by the political scientist David McNally and Susan Ferguson, and as part of the Historical Materialism Book Series. Reception Marxism and the Oppression of Women received mixed reviews from the sociologist Johanna Brenner in Contemporary Sociology, Gilda Zwerman in the American Journal of Sociology, Bonnie J. Fox in the Canadian Journal of Sociology, and Scarlet Pollock in the Canadian Review of Sociology & Anthropology. The book was also reviewed by Hester Eisenstein in Science & Society, Carol A. Brown in Qualitative Sociology, and Mary Margaret Fonow in Signs, and in Choice. Brenner credited Vogel with providing a \\"clear and lively presentation\\" which demonstrated that \\"classical marxist theory grappled with key questions for today's feminists\\". However, she wrote that Vogel's analysis \\"remains at such a high level of abstraction and generality that it never quite addresses the central issues that socialist-feminist theory has been engaging for more than a decade\\", and criticized Vogel for failing to explain \\"why the outcome of this class struggle seems to be almost universally a family system in which men exercise power over women\\", and for her neglect of the work of the anarchist Emma Goldman and the Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai. Zwerman considered Vogel's strategy for \\"demonstrating the power of Marxist theory\\" to be \\"interesting and intelligent\\". She credited Vogel with demonstrating that \\"those texts used most often by socialist feminists as representative of a Marxist perspective\\" are seriously flawed. However, she added that \\"there is far more to women's oppression than can be accounted for by their relationship to production\\" and wrote that Vogel \\"provides neither conceptual nor empirical tools for studying and understanding the significance of variations in women's domestic arrangements.\\" Fox credited Vogel with providing a \\"useful review of socialist analyses of women's subordinate position\\", and with showing that Lenin's analysis has not been substantially extended by subsequent socialist feminist writers, who unlike Lenin have neglected non-economic issues. However, she criticized Vogel for focusing on 19th-century theorists and ignoring more recent writers, and despite considering some of her ideas, such as those concerning women's child-bearing role, promising, found her attempt to provide \\"a theoretical framework for understanding women's oppression\\" unsuccessful because it ignored the radical feminist insight that \\"a theory of women's subordination must analyze the social relations between men and women (with their material base in sexual relations) which organize personal life.\\" She criticized Vogel for failing to see the merits of views such as those of Nancy Chodorow, and wrote that her book was \\"discordant with the reality of North American women's daily lives\\" and \\"fails to touch on their dreams and visions for the future.\\" Pollock welcomed Vogel's attempt to rework Marxist theory, and her criticism of \\"the tendency in earlier work to analyze gender and class relations separately.\\" However, she maintained that it left unresolved questions and problems, noting that while Vogel argued that, \\"Women's oppression is rooted in the function which their biology serves in terms of generational replacement in class relations\\", she was left with the need to \\"explain theoretically why the fact of different functions equals oppression\\" and also had to \\"find some way to account for the evidence of women's oppression prior to class-based societies as, theoretically, it has been made non-existent outside of the needs of the class struggle.\\" The 2016 edition of Marxism and the Oppression of Women received a positive review from Jessie Muldoon in International Socialist Review. She considered Vogel correct to acknowledge contributions made by Marx, Engels, August Bebel, Zetkin, and Lenin, though she considered it debatable whether Vogel was correct to make sharp distinctions between Marx's views and those of Engels. She credited Vogel with creating a framework to make possible a theory of women's oppression by developing the implications of partially developed insights elaborated by Marx in Das Kapital (1867‚Äì1883), thereby completing Marx's work in this field, with discrediting Mariarosa Dalla Costa's view that \\"domestic labor produces surplus value\\", and with demonstrating that \\"capital depends as much on reproduction as it does on production\\". She wrote that Vogel's \\"emphasis on material conditions and the biological differences between men and women ... may strike some readers as overly rigid\\" and dated, but she considered Vogel's \\"insistence on the material roots of both and the concomitant need for a united working-class force that can challenge both simultaneously\\" a \\"huge contribution to the building of a feminist movement rooted in Marxism\\" and concluded that Vogel's book \\"deserves to be recognized as a classic, indispensable companion to be read alongside Capital.\\" The political theorist Terrell Carver described Marxism and the Oppression of Women as a founding text of Marxist feminism. McNally and Ferguson argued that the book had only a small number of supporters, due to being published at \\"a moment of acute disarray for the socialist-feminist movement\\", but that its originality prevented it from being forgotten completely. In their view, the book was \\"arguably the most sophisticated Marxist intervention in the theoretical debates thrown up by socialist feminism\\", and the contemporary \\"resurgence of anti-capitalist struggle\\" made its republication timely.

Brands and publishers, for example, Newsmedia websites, are able to engage their audience on-site by surfacing their own editorial content that they have published in the past, displayed conspicuously as \\"You May Also Like...\\" or \\"We Recommend\\" often leading unsuspecting users into thinking of click-bait advertisements as original editorial content. These take the form of tracked links that are routed through Outbrain's servers. The Outbrain \\"From Around the Web\\" tool also provides a way for publishers to buy and sell traffic by providing third- party links to remotely relevant and unverified content. Reception Outbrain has often been compared with competitor Taboola. One way that Outbrain claimed to distinguish itself from Taboola was that it tried to pre- filter spammy links before displaying them, whereas Taboola had a feature called Taboola Choice, where users can offer feedback on what recommendations they do not like. Both Outbrain and Taboola have been described by Internet commentators as alternatives to Google AdSense that content publishers could consider for revenue streams. In November 2012, in response to criticism of it for showing spam links, Outbrain decided to cut off showing spam links and stated that doing so would cause it a 25% revenue cut, but that it was important for its long-term reputation with publishers and users. However, there has been continued criticism of the quality of recommendations offered by Outbrain. In August 2014, an article in Fortune noted the fierce competition between Taboola and Outbrain and both of their problems with spam recommendations and nearly all their clients promoting known scams.

She is a national outdoor and indoor champion for the pole vault, and also, a bronze medalist at the 2009 European Athletics Under-23 Championships in Kaunas, Lithuania. Film career Vandy is currently working as a film director and cinematographer.https://www.vanessavandy.com/about/ Her style lies in her ability to move people, to capture their attention and to evoke an emotion. Her first short film, Farewell, was selected as a finalist in One Screen 2017 Film Festival's Free The Bid - new female director category.http://www.onescreen.org/ Athletic career Born in Auckland to a New Zealand father and Finnish mother, Vandy holds a dual citizenship, and chose to represent her mother's birthplace Finland at numerous sporting events, including the Olympic games. At age ten, Vandy moved with her family to Vaasa, Finland, where she began pole vaulting at age 13. She eventually became a member of, and trained full-time at Vasa Idrottss√§llskap, under her personal and head coach Johan West√∂. In 2007, Vandy made her international debut at the European Junior Championships, where she achieved a seventh-place finish in the women's pole vault. She also set her personal best of 4.15 metres by winning the bronze medal at the Finnish Elite Series in Lahti, ahead of her teammate Minna Nikkanen, who flew over 4.05 metres. Shortly after the series, she continued to beat Nikkanen at the Sweden-match in Gothenburg, and most importantly, at the Finnish Indoor Championships in Joensuu, where she claimed her first ever career title in the pole vault. The following year, Vandy reached her breakthrough season by vaulting her personal best of 4.31 metres at an athletics meet in Sopot, Poland. She also finished sixth at the 2008 IAAF World Junior Championships in Bydgoszcz, and won her second career title at the national outdoor championships in Tampere, which gave her a qualifying berth for the Olympics. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Vandy successfully cleared a height of 4.00 metres in the women's pole vault, an event which was later dominated by world-record holder Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia. Vandy, however, failed to advance into the final, as she placed thirty-second overall in the qualifying rounds, tying her position with Tunisia's Leila Ben Youssef. In 2009, Vandy extended her personal best of 4.36 metres by finishing second at the Elite World Championships in Lapua, behind her teammate Minna Nikkanen. She also won the bronze medal at the European Athletics Under-23 Championships in Kaunas, Lithuania, with a satisfying height of 4.35 metres. In early 2011, Vandy announced her retirement from pole vault to focus on and pursue her career in filmmaking, having suffered knee problems for the past few years.

He was Southampton's first player signed as a professional. Football career Dollin was born in Southampton and had started his football career with Freemantle. In the close season of 1892, he joined Southampton St. Mary's. At the time of his signing, the club made no announcement about his professional status and this was kept secret for several years, probably to avoid the club being ostracised by other clubs. Speaking in 1948, Dollin revealed that he had been \\"paid ¬£1 a week and found a job\\". Described as a \\"versatile\\" player who could be \\"unpredictable in front of goal\\", Dollin played at outside-left in the qualifying matches in the 1892‚Äì93 FA Cup, defeating Newbury 4‚Äì1 (with three goals from Bob Kiddle) before crashing out with a 4‚Äì0 defeat against Maidenhead on 29 October 1892. In the Hampshire Senior Cup, Dollin scored in 2‚Äì0 wins over the Royal Engineers from Aldershot and a side from Portsmouth, helping the \\"Saints\\" to reach the final against Dollin's former side, Freemantle. In the final, Freemantle took an early lead before Dollin equalised. With the score 1‚Äì1 and only a few minutes left to play, a Freemantle forward, Horton, was about to score past Ralph Ruffell in the Saints' goal when he was tripped by William Stride. Although the Saints protested that the foul was outside the penalty area, the referee awarded a penalty to Freemantle, which was converted by Shirley Hawkins, thus preventing St. Mary's from claiming the trophy for the third consecutive year. By the end of the season, Dollin had suffered injuries to both knees and decided to revert to amateur status and returned to Freemantle. He later joined Eastleigh Athletic for whom he played until the mid-1900s.

This can involve increasing resilience by substituting local inputs for imported inputs, the smuggling of goods and an increase in barter trade. A country may even attempt to turn these pressures into opportunities. In some ways sanctioned economies bear some resemblance to an economy on a war or emergency footing. \\"Iran develops economy of resistance\\" by Najmeh Bozorgmehr in Isfahan; Financial Times; September 12, 2012 Measuring economic activity in nations under sanctions requires different techniques than those used for other countries. Terminology This phrase first used by Ayatollah Khamenei Supreme Leader of Iran during a meeting with Iranian entrepreneurs as a response to the Western sanctions and subversion policies against Iran in 2011.  History  Gaza The term was used in relation to the Gaza strip. In September 2007 Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza, focused on weapons and construction materials that could be used for terrorist purposes. At its height, the blockade also limited agricultural imports and exports via Israel. Imports and exports via Egypt have been subject to varying Egyptian policies, with Egypt at times also greatly restricting traffic as an \\"anti-terrorist\\" measure.A Multi Criteria Crop Planning Model Based on the \\"Resistive Economy\\" Characterizing the Situation in Gaza Strip.

In detail, it encourages increased exports of electricity, gas, petrochemicals, and oil byproducts instead of crude oil and other raw materials, expansion of the production and exportation of knowledge-based products, increase in domestic production of strategic goods, development of markets in neighboring countries, reforming consumption patterns and fighting corruption.http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13921213000830http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940118000995 =Policies of resistance economy= The ‚ÄúResistance Economy‚Äù is a concept declared originally by the Supreme Leader of Iran. In his June 2012 speech, he claims 'A few years ago, I proposed the idea of 'economy of resistance'\\". According to this speech he first talked about resistance economy on the 21. March 2007. While he does not explicitly mention the term economy of resistance or resistance economy here (on the English translation), he does mention key aspects of what he will later refer to as resistance economy such as the criticism of extravagant consumption. In his August 2012 speech he explains that resistance economy aims to promote economic self-reliance, a strategy that would defeat the US-led efforts against Iran via economic and trade sanctions. ‚ÄúThe Resistance Economy is an inspiring pattern of the Islamic economic system and a good chance to make an economic epic,‚Äù said Ayatollah Khamenei. In his March 2014 speech, Khamenei specifies the ten main aspects of the economy of resistance: 1\\\\. Creating dynamism 2\\\\. Resistance against threatening elements 3\\\\. Reliance on domestic capacities 4\\\\. Adopting a jihadi outlook 5\\\\. Making the people the pivot 6\\\\. Security for strategic and fundamental goods 7\\\\. Reducing oil dependence 8\\\\. Reforming the norms of consumption (no decadence and waste) 9\\\\. Combatting corruption 10\\\\. Promoting a knowledge-based economy According to the Center for Preserving and Publishing the Works of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei stressed, \\"Following an indigenous scientific pattern, rooted in the revolutionary and Islamic culture, will lead to defeat of enemies and their withdrawal from an imposed economic war against the Iranian nation\\". ‚ÄúThe Resistance Economy will also present an inspiring pattern of the Islamic economic system for the growing international crises and can prepare the ground for creating an economic epic.‚Äù The 24-point general policies of Iran‚Äôs Resistance Economy were set based on the Article 110 of the Constitution and after consulting with the Expediency Council. The ideology of the Resistance Economy, with its core concepts of self-sufficiency, proclaims that the Islamic Republic can survive ‚Äî and indeed flourish ‚Äî despite the US-led sanctions.

Kuhns is an author, artist, businessman, venture capitalist and investment banker. His published fiction takes place in both domestic and foreign settings, while much of his business career has been in the alternative energy industry. He has founded and taken five companies public. In addition to the United States, Kuhns also has established companies and developed projects in Argentina, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, England, Honduras, India, Ireland, Mexico,Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Wales. Kuhns has been interviewed for CNBC, Reuters Insider, Fox Business, Forbes, Bloomberg Law, and most recently as the cover story Journey to the East by The Edge, on the business and economic climate in China and Southeast Asia. Education Born in Lake Forest, Illinois to college professors, Kuhns spent his formative years in Takoma Park, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where he was educated in the public schools. A member of the Class of 1972 at Georgetown University, he graduated from with an A.B in Sociology and in Fine Arts. Kuhns was a four-year starter at middle linebacker on the Georgetown varsity football team. Leading the team in tackles for two years, and the second leading tackler in his other two campaigns, Kuhns was elected a team captain in his senior year. He was inducted into the Georgetown University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. A sculptor, Kuhns received a scholarship to study fine arts at the University of Chicago in 1973 after a Georgetown professor, without Kuhns‚Äô knowledge, submitted his art portfolio to the school. He graduated with a Master's in Fine Arts degree in 1975. Subsequently, he attended Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts, graduating with a Master's in Business Administration degree in 1977. During his summer between years at business school, he worked on the bond trading desk at the investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers in its Boston office. Career Kuhns‚Äô career as an investment banker began when he joined Salomon Brothers in New York in 1977 in its public finance department, working on publicly owned electric utility projects. Later, he left with a group of Salomon Brothers partners to form J.J. Lowrey & Co., a bond trading and project finance investment bank, where he was a general partner. In 1986, Kuhns acquired control of the Laidlaw, Adams & Peck investment bank, one of the oldest continuously operated financial firms in the United States, and changed the firm's name to Kuhns Brothers & Laidlaw. Under his direction, Kuhns Brothers has financed many companies, including the IPO for CalEnergy, one of the world's largest geothermal power corporations. Kuhns has focused on financing domestic alternative energy companies, power technology ventures and infrastructure companies, as well as many foreign issuers, mainly from China, since 1989. As an entrepreneur, Kuhns has taken 5 of his own companies public. In 1981, Kuhns founded Catalyst Energy Corporation, one of the first publicly traded independent power producers in America. In 1986, the company completed its IPO and became listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol . Catalyst became the largest independent power company generating electricity for sale to utilities in 1988. The company became known for its ability to take advantage of loopholes, such as buying a St. Louis steam generator, and leasing the generator's distribution pipes from the state of Missouri. Because Catalyst did not own the distribution pipes, it was exempt from many regulations. In 1984 while CEO of Catalyst, Kuhns made his first visit to China, going to Chengdu to purchase hydroelectric generating equipment, and becoming the first American to do so in the process. In 1987, Kuhns supervised the IPO of Catalyst's steam power affiliate‚ÄîCatalyst Thermal Energy Corporation. By 1988, Catalyst had revenues of $417 million and assets worth $1 billion, and was the fastest-growing public company in America from 1982 to 1987 according to Inc. Magazine. Kuhns continued to develop and invest in alternative energy and renewable energy projects throughout China and other parts of the developing world. In 1992 he founded and was the chairman and CEO of The New World Power Corporation, a wholly renewable-based independent power producer. His work with New World focused on alternate energy. At New World, he developed and financed hydroelectric projects in Costa Rica, China, Argentina, and Mexico, and wind farms in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2006 as chairman and CEO, Kuhns formed China Hydroelectric Corporation, an owner and developer of hydroelectric projects in China. China Hydroelectric Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. Kuhns organized the China Hand Fund, which invested in companies in China, in 2007. In 2012, Kuhns became executive chairman of NanoFlex Power Corporation (formerly Global Photonic Energy Corporation), a developer of intellectual property which holds over 600 patents worldwide in advanced solar technology. Kuhns had been an investor and board member of the company since 1999. NanoFlex went public in 2013. In 2016, Kuhns established and funded Bougainville Fund Management, LLC, a private equity fund management company organized to make and manage investments in Bougainville, an island archipelago in the South Pacific. Currently an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea, Bougainville‚Äîwhich possesses billions in gold, copper and silver‚Äîis scheduled to conduct a referendum vote on its independence on June 15, 2019. Bougainville Fund Management's initial investment is the Bougainville Gold Exchange Limited, a business established and licensed to buy, deal in and export gold, which is now the largest on Bougainville. Subsequently, the company, together with a customary landowner partner, was granted a license to conduct mechanical alluvial gold mining. The license was the first such gold mining license to be issued on Bougainville. Books Kuhns first novel was loosely based on his hydroelectric business in China. China Fortunes was released in 2010 by Wiley. The book follows a protagonist named Jack Davis, \\"an American financier lured by the spectacular promise of the confusing land, from early success and a meteoric IPO that seems too easy, to treachery and loss, and triumphant financial and emotional renewal.\\" Jing Daily described it as a \\"vivid illustration\\" of \\"the opportunities and obstacles experienced by foreign businesspeople in the early days of China‚Äôs sometimes uncomfortable embrace of capitalism‚Ä¶China Fortunes manages to tread the fine line between entertainment and education, never losing sight of the adventure and mind- expanding aspects of living and working in China as a foreigner.\\" The book received positive reviews with Terry McDonell, the former managing editor of Sports Illustrated calling it, \\"a smart and stylish take on what business really is in modern China. Kuhns knows both cold, and most important, he can tell a great story‚Ä¶ironic, fast moving and sharply observed. It will lock you in.\\" Kuhns' second novel, Ballad of a Tin Man, was published in 2016 by Post Hill Press. Once again the story line involves business, but the setting changes from China to South Florida, and this time protagonist Jack Davis needs help from some notable underworld figures. Kuhns' third novel, South of the Clouds, a story about smuggling jade over the Sino-Burmese border in China's southwestern province of Yunnan, was published by Post Hill Press in 2018. \\"An engaging novel with a protagonist who remains appealing, even as he tiptoes into shady territory,\\"‚ÄîKirkus Review. Ballad of a Tin Man and South of the Clouds have been optioned by Los Angeles-based film producer RainMaker Films.

Football career Verney joined Southampton St. Mary's in 1888, three years after they had been founded. Described as \\"a tenacious half- back\\" who persisted \\"in his efforts to challenge for every loose ball\\", he linked up well with William Stride. In March 1889, Verney was part of the St. Mary's team that played four matches to get past Cowes in the semi-final of the Hampshire Junior Cup, with the opening goal in the third replay resulting from his corner-kick, which he followed up by scoring the second goal when his shot went past the goalkeeper who had been charged by another player. The \\"Saints\\" won the match 4‚Äì1 and went on to win the cup with a 3‚Äì0 victory over Christchurch in the final. They retained the trophy by defeating Lymington 2‚Äì0 in the following year. In January 1891, St. Mary's entered the Hampshire Senior Cup for the first time. In the second round, they met Geneva Cross, a team from the Royal Victoria Military Hospital at Netley. The match was played at the Antelope Ground on a pitch that was frozen in places with \\"ankle deep mud\\" at the Infirmary End, but St. Mary's emerged victorious with Verney scoring one of five goals. St. Mary's progressed to the final where they defeated a team from the Royal Engineers, based at Aldershot, by a 2‚Äì1 margin. The success in local cup competitions prompted the club committee to enter a national tournament for the first time ‚Äì in the First Qualifying Round of the FA Cup on 3 October 1891, they played at Warmley near Bristol, winning comfortably 4‚Äì1, with Verney playing at left-half. In the next round, St. Mary's defeated Reading 7‚Äì0, with Verney scoring one of the goals, but the match was awarded to Reading following an FA enquiry into the eligibility of two St. Mary's players, Jock Fleming and Alexander McMillan. In March 1892, St. Mary's retained the Hampshire Senior Cup, with an easy 5‚Äì0 victory over a Medical Staff team. In 1892‚Äì93, Verney played in both FA Cup matches, with the Saints going out 4‚Äì0 to Maidenhead and in all three Hampshire Senior Cup matches, losing 1‚Äì2 to Freemantle in the final. In the following year, he was again ever-present in both cups, with St. Mary's going out to Reading in the second qualifying round of the FA Cup and losing the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup to the Royal Engineers. In 1894, St. Mary's were founder members of the Southern League. Although Verney remained with St. Mary's until 1896, his last two seasons were spent in the reserves and he made no Southern League appearances. After leaving the Saints, Verney turned out occasionally for a minor local side, Cranbury Avenue.

The copper plates were found mostly in Panchakhanda pargana where historians opined that actual granted lands are located. This Sanskrit inscription contains the names of donees which are more than two hundred in numbers. The inscriptions recorded by Bhaskaravarman in different parts of India provide a detailed account of his rule and associate events. It was customary among the kings of Kamarupa to issue seals for every major event related to the kingdom be they giving land grants to Brahmins or winning a war. Discovery The copper plates were discovered on 29 December 1912, in the village of Nidhanpur in Panchakhanda near what is now Sylhet in Bangladesh. They were discovered by a cultivator during the process of building a buffalo shed. Thinking that they were a clue to the location of a hidden treasure, he took the plates to a local landholder who recognised them for what they were and brought them to the attention of authorities in Silchar in present-day Assam, India. Translation The following is the translation of the inscription by Padmanath Bhattacharya Vidya Vinod: Since after the burning of the plates, these newly written letters are (obviously) different in form (from the letters of the earlier grant) they are not (to be respected as) forged.'

The Garden is relatively small and houses an enormous diversity of plants, both indigenous to South Africa and introduced species. It is open to the public. History The history of the Stellenbosch University Botanical Garden dates back to 1902 when lecturer Augusta Vera Duthie grew plants next to the then Main Building on campus for research and student practicals. The Botanical Garden's current site dates back to 1922 when Gert Cornelius Nel, professor of botany at the time convinced the University Council to allocate land for the establishment of the Garden. Hans Herre was appointed as the first curator of the Garden in 1925. Curators of the botanical garden included Hans Herre (1925‚Äì1962), Wim Tijmens (1962‚Äì1999), Deon Kotze (1999‚Äì2012), Martin Smit (2013‚Äì2018), and Donovan Kirkwood (2018-). Key functions and activities The Stellenbosch University Botanical Garden fulfills many functions within the university and the local community. The garden supports research and training of students within Stellenbosch University, and increasingly has a strong conservation focus with work on species on the brink of extinction. In 2018 the garden was accredited as a Conservation Practitioner by Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI). The local community and other visitors also utilize the garden for both relaxation and education. Some facilities in the garden include: The Botanical Garden Shop, which functions as a visitor center but also sells various books, seeds and local plant products; A small specialist nursery and the Katjiepiering Restaurant. The garden itself is also utilized for sculpture exhibitions. Plant collections Western Cape Bonsai Heritage Collection at Stellenbosch University Botanical GardenWelwitschia mirabilis, growing in one of the succulent greenhousesStellenbosch is located in a valley at an average elevation of 136m above sea-level. It has a Mediterranean climate with dry warm summers. Winters are cool and rainy. During spring and autumn daytime temperatures hover in the 20¬∞C's. This mild climate allows the garden to grow an incredible diversity of plant species. Various plants indigenous to the Cape Floral Kingdom and southern Africa, many of them rare, threatened or endangered species, can be found in the garden. Even some indigenous species now classified as extinct in the wild, such as Erica verticillata, can also be found in the garden. The garden also has various theme gardens and various specific plant collections. Bonsai The Western Cape Bonsai Heritage Collection is probably the biggest publicly accessible collection of bonsai in South Africa and features trees from well-known South African bonsai enthusiasts such as Becky Lucas, Gerjo van der Merwe and Louis Nel. Ferns A large collection of ferns can be found throughout the garden, especially in the two ferneries. Several species of ferns and tree ferns (especially the genus Cyathea) along with other closely related plants such as horsetails (Equisetum) are among the genera represented in the collection. Insectivorous plants Several insectivorous plant species are grown in the garden, including pitcher plants (Nepenthes and Sarracenia) and sundews (Drosera). Medicinal plants Medicinal plants and herbs from all over the world and southern Africa can be found in the garden. Some indigenous medicinal plants found in the collection include: boegoe (Agathosma), cancer bush (Lessertia frutescens), wild rosemary (Eriocephalus africanus), Pelargonium peltatum and Tetradenia riparia to name a few. Oxalis The collection was started in 2001 and has grown to currently include about 70% of southern African species. It acts as both a reference and research collection, and houses almost all specimens included in the species-level molecular phylogenetic reconstruction of southern African Oxalis. Succulents and xerophytes A wide variety of succulent and xerophytic plants from especially southern Africa and Madagascar can be found in the two arid houses and throughout the garden. Some interesting succulents and xerophytes on display include Welwitschia mirabilis, Aloidendron dichotomum (quiver tree), Xerosicyos danguyi (silver dollar vine), Dioscorea elephantipes (elephant's foot) and Pachypodium namaquanum (halfmens). Rare vygies such as Herreanthus meyeri (named after Hans Herre), Meyerophytum meyeri and Fenestraria aurantiaca are also on display. Trees Some interesting trees that can be found in the garden include Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia - the biggest tree species on earth), Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood - thought to be extinct until 1948) and Sequoia sempervirens (Californian redwood - the tallest tree species on earth). Other trees of interest vary from olive trees (Olea europaea) grown from cuttings taken from the Garden of Gethsemane, to various trees indigenous to southern Africa such as Nuxia floribunda (forest elder), to subtropical trees such as Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon).

The episode, written by executive producer Tim Minear and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, originally aired on January 23, 2013. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). In the episode, Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson) is interviewed about her career, including shutting down Briarcliff, exposing now-Cardinal Howard (Joseph Fiennes), and the fates of the surviving patients Jude (Jessica Lange) and Kit (Evan Peters). After the interview, she is confronted by Johnny (Dylan McDermott), who intends to kill her. Plot 2012 Johnny breaks into the boarded-up asylum, listening to an audiobook called Tales from Briarcliff, written and read by Lana. He imagines her telling him she could not wait to give him up and that he should never have been born. As she relates via audio that Oliver Thredson was an \\"unspeakable monster\\", Johnny imagines Thredson telling him that he loved him and that Lana kept them apart. Then, Leo and Teresa enter the asylum as seen in \\"Welcome to Briarcliff\\". They end up at the cell where Johnny waits inside. He puts on the Bloody Face mask, pulls out a machete, and chops off Leo's arm holding the camera-phone. 1971 Lana has become a television investigative reporter. She and her camera crew sneak into the asylum via the tunnel to film Briarcliff Exposed. She plans on rescuing Sister Jude after learning she was still alive. They film in the former kitchen, where an attendant catches them. Lana asks about Jude and imagines rescuing her, when, in reality, Jude had already been released. Lana goes to the office, searching through files scattered on the floor, to find Jude's file. She then goes to Kit Walker's residence after learning he was the one who got Jude out of Briarcliff. He relates to her what happened to Jude after he brought her home. Kit helped Jude through detox of the asylum medication. She then relapsed into an insane authoritarian and chases his children, Thomas and Julia, with a broom. He tried to send the kids out of the room to protect them, but instead they both lead Jude by hand out to the nearby woods. Later, with her mind inexplicably healed, Jude bonds with the family, becoming a surrogate grandmother to the children. Jude is truly happy for the first time in her life. Six months later, Jude suddenly dies due to a kiss from the Angel of Death, which she is finally ready for. 2013 Lana is getting ready for a television interview about her career. The interview is held in her spacious New York City apartment where she lives with her new life-partner Marian, a famous opera singer who leaves for work. The young interviewer, April Mayfield, wishes to begin by discussing Oliver Thredson, but Lana refuses by saying he has become a \\"household name\\" and is undeserving of further mention. They instead discuss Lana's career change from print to television and her expos√© of Briarcliff. April praises her for shutting down the asylum but Lana wished for a different ending to the piece by finding Jude there. Lana momentarily stops the interview and asks for water, which is delivered by a member of the crew ‚Äì Johnny. The interview resumes about Lana's exposing of Timothy Howard in the 1970s, (he has since been anointed as the Cardinal of New York) with his knowledge of Dr. Arden's experiments and the general mistreatment of the asylum patients. Howard denied the allegations on camera, but later kills himself at home by slashing his wrists in a bathtub. April listens as Lana admits to lying in her book about her baby's death as well as certain details about her life and sexual orientation. Lana mentions saving Johnny as a boy from a bully in the 1970s. She chose not to stay in touch with him, but often thought about him. Lana also mentions Kit developing pancreatic cancer in the 1980s, and that one day he just disappeared, never to be seen again. It is shown that Kit was in fact taken from his home by aliens. April ends the interview for the day and she and her crew leave Lana alone in the apartment, but Lana pours two drinks. She knows someone has stayed behind ‚Äì Johnny. She knew who he was after the police previously showed his picture to her. They were investigating someone breaking into Thredson's former house in Massachusetts, killing the occupants, and living in it. Johnny tells her that he knew she was his mother after she approached him that day on the playground when he was a boy. His hatred for his mother began when he purchased Thredson's taped confession to her online, and Thredson begging Lana not to abort the pregnancy. He puts a gun to her head, but she convinces him that he is not a killer like his father. He lowers the gun and breaks down in tears, admitting that he's hurt people. Lana tells him that it's not his fault before turning the gun on him, insisting that it's her fault and proceeds to blow his brains out, killing him. 1964 Flashing back to the events of the season premiere, shortly after Lana visited Briarcliff, Sister Jude cautions Lana about her desire to question a killer coming into the asylum. Prior to both of them leaving, Jude states, \\"If you look in the face of evil, evil's going to look right back at you.\\" Lana simply looks at Jude and smiles. The Virgin Mary statue is seen while Sister Jude smiles and \\"Dominique\\" begins playing. Production \\"Madness Ends\\" is written by executive producer Tim Minear and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. In a January 2013 interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy spoke about his original vision for the episode, \\"When I pitched this season, the original final episode was all just going to be Act One. It was gonna be a longer version of that. The original finale was gonna be Sarah Paulson now free, a Jacqueline Susann / Truman Capote type, gets a kick in her conscience from Kit and goes back in and shuts that down. And we were gonna have the whole last hour be a documentary of her doing that. But I think when we were working on that I thought, 'I don't want to see feces smeared people for an hour. It's so grim.' So we abandoned that around Episode 10. We thought, 'Let's give Jude a happy ending. Let's make that one act. But let's really make the last act Paulson vs. \\"Bloody Face\\".' So we broke that out early on but kept the original idea. I was thrilled with the changes. I was very thrilled with how emotional it was. Some of that was [FX Network president] John Landgraf who felt very strongly that Kit needed to go back in and get Sister Jude out not for himself but for his children. That dialogue was all sort of John's that I thought was very beautiful. Tim [Minear] did a breath-taking script. It just all came together.\\" Reception \\"Madness Ends\\" received a 1.3 18‚Äì49 ratings share and was watched by 2.29 million viewers in its original American broadcast, slightly lower than the previous episode. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 88% approval rating, based on 17 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"The unexpectedly subtle \\"Madness Ends\\" provides a satisfying ending to Asylum with a twisted sort of empathy and sensitivity, though attempts to underscore its harrowing socio-medical commentary prove unsubstantial.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, \\"These last two episodes haven't so radically changed my opinion of American Horror Story as to blind me to its weird storytelling lurches and haphazard character development, but they have increased my belief in what this show is capable of. Where once I saw a goofy lark that could occasionally turn out a fun, twist-laden episode, I now see a show that has ambitions beyond simply trying to make people laugh and/or shriek in equal manner.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN commented, \\"\\"Madness Ends\\" did that unexpected thing of making you realize that you cared about characters you never knew you cared about so much. Not everything about Asylum worked, but this final chapter made me glad I spent quality time with lunatics.\\" References External links * * \\"Madness Ends\\" at TV Guide.com Category:Fiction set in 1964 Category:Fiction set in 1971 Category:American Horror Story: Asylum episodes Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Filicide in fiction ","title":"Madness Ends"},{"id":"37982247","text":"Florin Ionu≈£ Ilie (born 18 June 1992) is a Romanian footballer who plays as a centre back for Liga I side UTA Arad.Cinci dintr-un foc!

He was one of the co-founders of the F+F Schule f√ºr experimentelle Gestaltung in Zurich and known for his German translations of the works of Marcel Duchamp. Stauffer can be considered to have pioneered art as research.Michael Hiltbrunner: Einf√ºhrung. In: Helmhaus Z√ºrich (ed.): Serge Stauffer, Kunst als Forschung, Zurich: Scheidegger & Spiess Edition, 2013, pp.7‚Äì9. Life and work From 1952 to 1955, Stauffer trained as a photographer under Hans Finsler and Alfred Willimann at the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich KGSZ. During this period, he met his future wife Doris Stauffer-Kloetzer. Stauffer first became known for his German translation of Eug√®ne Ionesco's play The Bald Soprano, which premiered at the Klein-Theater Bern in 1956 (among other actors, its cast included Daniel Spoerri) and was published by Luchterhand in 1959.See Eug√®ne Ionesco: ¬´Die kahle S√§ngerin¬ª. Translated from French by Serge Stauffer. In: Eug√®ne Ionesco: Theaterst√ºcke. Band 1. Darmstadt: Luchterhand Edition, 1959 As a photographer, Stauffer worked for Josef M√ºller-Brockmann‚Äôs graphic design studio, before returning to the KGSZ in 1957 to teach photographics and experimental photography. From 1957 to 1964, he designed exhibitions, catalogs, and posters. Among other projects, he worked on Dokumentation √ºber Marcel Duchamp (1960), an exhibition organised by Max Bill at Zurich‚Äôs Museum of Design.See Hans Fischli und Willy Rotzler (eds.): Dokumentation √ºber Marcel Duchamp. (Wegleitung 234 des Kunstgewerbemuseums der Stadt Z√ºrich), [Exhibition Catalog]. Z√ºrich: Kunstgewerbemuseum, 1960. Stauffer‚Äôs early work includes the playful object Jardin public (1960), which was published as an edition at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1961. In the period 1962‚Äì1964, he undertook comprehensive studies on optical illusions, which he called geometrical- optical illusions (g.o.t), using geometrical drawings and photogrammes.See [Serge Stauffer]: Autobiographie. In: Marcel Duchamp: Interviews und Statements. Gesammelt, √ºbersetzt und annotiert von Serge Stauffer, ed. Ulrike Gauss. Stuttgart: Graphische Sammlung Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 1992. pp. 243f, esp. p. 243. From 1964 to 1965 Stauffer taught at the Bath Academy of Art, in Corsham, England. In 1964, Stauffer and Hansj√∂rg Mattm√ºller laid the foundation for an experimental arts class. A year later, in 1965, the class opened its doors as the F+F (short for \\"Form und Farbe\\", i.e., form and colour) at the KGSZ.See Hans-Rudolf Lutz, Hansj√∂rg Mattm√ºller, Serge Stauffer (eds.): Experiment F+F 1965‚Äì70. Z√ºrich: Verlag H.R. Lutz, [1970]. Following a move to abolish the F+F course on Teamwork, established by Doris Stauffer, and to introduce \\"unacceptable teaching conditions\\", in March 1970 a council of students and teachers jointly decided to dissolve the F+F and to dismiss all teaching staff.See Lutz et al., 1970, unpaginated (Pappelmann-Rapport, K√ºndigungsschreiben der Klasse F+F vom 13. M√§rz 1970). Following this decision, Bendicht Fivian, Peter Gygax, Peter Jenny, Hansj√∂rg Mattm√ºller, Doris Stauffer, and Serge Stauffer established the F+F Schule f√ºr experimentelle Gestaltung, a privately run art school, in January 1971.See Stauffer 1992, p. 244. One of their rolemodels for a liberated art-education was the Summerhill School in Leiston, Suffolk, England. Tom Holert, the German art historian, has described how artists like Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Asger Jorn, and the artist and philosopher Piero Simondo had been exploring possibilities for conducting artistic research since the 1950s and 60s.See Tom Holert: K√ºnstlerische Forschung: Anatomie einer Konjunktur. In: Texte zur Kunst, no. 82, Jahrgang 20, Juni 2011. pp. 38‚Äì63, esp. pp. 39‚Äì41. Already while teaching at the KGSZ, Stauffer had started elaborating concepts for art as research. In 1968, he delivered a paper at the conference of the Schweizerische Werkbund (SWB) on the artist as researcher. In 1976, he presented his Thesen zu Kunst als Forschung [Theses on Art as Research] within the context of an F+F exhibition held in the lobby of the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich.See Stauffer 1992, p. 244. Reprinted in: Hansj√∂rg Mattm√ºller (ed.): F+F Z√ºrich. Das offene Kunststudium. Bern: Benteli Verlag, 1991. p. 252f. In 1978‚Äì79, Stauffer lectured on \\"Art as Research\\" at the Department of Art History of the University of Zurich. In 1981, he published an essay on \\"Art as Research\\" in the book Genie gibt‚Ä≤s ‚Äì Die siebziger Jahre an der F&F; Schule f√ºr experimentelle Gestaltung.Serge Stauffer: Kunst als Forschung.

From 1956 to 1967, Stauffer entered into a lengthy correspondence with Marcel Duchamp, whose work he explored in great detail. His extensive research on Duchamp led to the publication in 1973 of the book Ready Made ‚Äì 180 Ausspr√ºche aus Interviews mit Marcel Duchamp. This was followed in 1981 by Die Schriften ‚Äì Zu Lebzeiten ver√∂ffentlichte Texte mit √ºbersetzten und faksimilierten Texten von Marcel Duchamp, which Stauffer co-edited with Theo Ruff. The volume Marcel Duchamp: Interviews und Statements was published posthumously in 1992.See Stauffer 1992 Stauffer maintained a lifelong friendship with the Swiss artist and poet Andr√© Thomkins, which resulted in an extensive correspondence. Their friendship is documented in Thomkins‚Äôs monograph Oh! Cet Echo! (1985).See Andr√© Thomkins: ¬´oh! cet √©cho!¬ª. andr√© thomkins an serge stauffer. dokumente einer freundschaft mit echo.

The incident took place when Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern, was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was travelling with her male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died two days later. The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country. Since Indian law does not allow the press to publish a rape victim's name, the victim was widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning \\"fearless\\", and her struggle and death became a symbol of women's resistance to rape around the world. All the accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody from possible suicide on 11 March 2013. According to some published reports, the police say Ram Singh hanged himself, but defence lawyers and his family allege he was murdered. The rest of the accused went on trial in a fast-track court; the prosecution finished presenting its evidence on 8 July 2013. The juvenile was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility, as per the Juvenile Justice Act. \\" Fast Track court awards death sentences to convicts of Delhi Rape case \\" , Ramalingam.Va, Le Journal International, 14 septembre 2013 On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death by hanging. In the death reference case and hearing appeals on 13 March 2014, Delhi High Court upheld the guilty verdict and the death sentences. On 18 December 2019, the Supreme Court of India rejected the final appeals of the condemned perpetrators of the attack. The four adult convicts were hanged on 20 March 2020. As a result of the protests, in December 2012, a judicial committee was set up to study and take public suggestions for the best ways to amend laws to provide quicker investigation and prosecution of sex offenders. After considering about 80,000 suggestions, the committee submitted a report which indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. In 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee, several new laws were passed, and six new fast-track courts were created to hear rape cases. Critics argue that the legal system remains slow to hear and prosecute rape cases, but most agree that the case has resulted in a tremendous increase in the public discussion of crimes against women and statistics show that there has been an increase in the number of women willing to file a crime report. However, in December 2014, two years after the attack, the victim's father called the promises of reform unmet and said that he felt regret in that he had not been able to bring justice for his daughter and other women like her. A BBC documentary titled India's Daughter based on the attack was broadcast in the UK on 4 March 2015. Indian-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta's 2016 film Anatomy of Violence was also based on the incident, exploring the social conditions and values in Indian society that made it possible. \\"Anatomy of Violence examines the men involved in the Delhi attack\\" . The Globe and Mail, 8 September 2016. On 9 July 2018, the petition filed by the convicts in Supreme Court to reduce their death sentence to life imprisonment but SC upheld its earlier decision. The summary of the case is as follows: \\"The men convicted of raping and torturing a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012 will hang, the Supreme Court ruled today, confirming its earlier decision and rejecting the request of three of four convicts for their sentence to be reduced to a life term.\\" The convicts were executed by the state on 20 March 2020. The Netflix original 2019 TV series Delhi Crime is based on the Delhi Police's search for the culprits of this case. Incident The victims, a 23-year-old woman, Jyoti Singh and her male friend, were returning home on the night of 16 December 2012 after watching the film Life of Pi in Saket, South Delhi. They boarded the bus at Munirka for Dwarka at about 9:30 pm (IST). There were only six others on the bus, including the driver. One of the men, identified as minor, had called for passengers telling them that the bus was going towards their destination. Her friend became suspicious when the bus deviated from its normal route and its doors were shut. When he objected, the group of six men already on board, including the driver, taunted the couple, asking what they were doing alone at such a late hour. During the argument, a scuffle ensued between her friend and the group of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked unconscious with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti to the rear of the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. A medical report later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle. According to police reports Jyoti attempted to fight off her assailants, biting three of the attackers and leaving bite marks on the accused men. After the beatings and rape ended, the attackers threw both victims from the moving bus. One of the perpetrators later cleaned the vehicle to remove evidence. Police impounded it the next day. The partially clothed victims were found on the road by a passerby at around 11 pm. The passerby called the Delhi Police who took the couple to Safdarjung Hospital, where Jyoti was given emergency treatment and placed on mechanical ventilation. She was found with injury marks, including numerous bite marks, all over her body. According to reports, one of the accused men admitted to having seen a rope-like object, assumed to be her intestines, being pulled out of the woman by the other assailants on the bus. Two blood-stained metal rods were retrieved from the bus and medical staff confirmed that \\"it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines\\". Victims Jyoti Singh was born and raised in Delhi, while her parents were from a small village in the Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh. Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview, he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. \\"Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed to never deny my children of education, so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge.\\" He said : \\"It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school.\\" In compliance with Indian law, the real name of the victim was initially not released to the media, so pseudonyms were used for her by various media houses instead, including Jagruti (\\"awareness\\"), Jyoti (\\"flame\\"), Amanat (\\"treasure\\"), Nirbhaya (\\"fearless one\\"), Damini (\\"lightning\\", after the 1993 Hindi film) and Delhi braveheart. The male victim was a software engineer from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, who lives in Ber Sarai, New Delhi; he suffered broken limbs but survived. Delhi police registered a criminal case against the editor of a Delhi-based tabloid, Mail Today, for disclosing the female victim's identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code. Shashi Tharoor, then a union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, with a view to showing respect for her courageous response by naming future laws after her. Speaking to a British press reporter on 5 January, the victim's father was quoted as saying, \\"We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.\\" Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father's reported quote and the victim's name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name. However, the following day Zee News quoted the father as saying, \\"I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one.\\" During a protest against the juvenile convict's release on 16 December 2015, the victim's mother said that the victim's name was Jyoti Singh and she was not ashamed of disclosing her name. Medical treatment and death On 19 December 2012, Singh underwent her fifth surgery which removed most of her remaining intestine. Doctors reported that she was in \\"stable but critical\\" condition. On 21 December, the government appointed a committee of doctors to ensure she received the best medical care. By 25 December, she remained intubated, on life support and in critical condition. Doctors stated that she had a fever of 102 to 103 ¬∞F (39 ¬∞C) and that internal bleeding due to sepsis was somewhat controlled. It was reported that she was \\"stable, conscious and meaningfully communicative\\". At a cabinet meeting chaired by Manmohan Singh on 26 December, the decision was taken to fly her to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore for further care. Mount Elizabeth is a multi-organ transplant speciality hospital. Some doctors criticised the decision as political, questioning the need to transfer an intensive care unit (ICU) patient for organ transplants that were not scheduled for weeks or even months later. Government sources indicate that the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, was personally behind the decision. Hours earlier, Union Minister P. Chidambaram had stated that Jyoti was not in a condition to be moved. An anonymous source quoted by The Sunday Guardian stated that the decision to move her was taken \\"when it was already clear that she would not survive the next 48 hours\\". During the six-hour flight by air-ambulance to Singapore on 27 December, Jyoti suddenly went into a \\"near collapse\\", which a later report described as a cardiac arrest. The doctors on the flight created an arterial line to stabilise her, but she had been without pulse and blood pressure for nearly three minutes and never regained consciousness in Singapore. On 28 December, at 11 am (IST), her condition was extremely critical. The chief executive officer of the Mount Elizabeth Hospital said that the victim suffered brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection, and that she was \\"fighting for her life.\\" Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she died at 4:45 am on 29 December, Singapore Standard Time (2:15 am, 29 December, IST; 8:45 pm, 28 December, UTC). Her body was cremated on 30 December in Delhi under high police security. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the country's main opposition party at that time criticised the high security levels, stating that they were reminiscent of the Emergency era, during which civil liberties were suspended. Arrests Police had found and arrested some suspects within 24 hours of the crime. From recordings made by a highway CCTV vehicle, a description of the bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants with the help of the male victim, and used a mobile phone stolen from the two victims to find one of the assailants. Six men were arrested in connection with the incident. They included Ram Singh, the bus driver, and his brother, Mukesh Singh, who were both arrested in Rajasthan. Ram and Mukesh Singh lived in Ravidas camp, a slum in South Delhi. Vinay Sharma, an assistant gym instructor, and Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, were both arrested in UP and Bihar. A seventeen-year-old juvenile named Mohammed Afroz, from Badayun, Uttar Pradesh, was arrested at the Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi. The juvenile had only met the others that day. Akshay Thakur, who had come to Delhi seeking employment, was arrested in Aurangabad, Bihar. According to reports, the group had been eating and drinking together and \\"having a party\\" earlier in the day. Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers or even to operate in Delhi because of its tinted windows, they decided to take it out \\"to have some fun\\". A few hours before committing the gang rape, the attackers had robbed a carpenter. The carpenter was 35-year-old Ram Adhar, who boarded the bus that was being driven by Mukesh Singh. The juvenile convict had lured him into the bus saying it was going to Nehru Place. He was then beaten up and robbed of his mobile phone and 1500 in cash. After robbing him, the group dumped him at the IIT Flyover. Ram reported about the group in the bus robbing him to three police constables: Kailash, Ashok and Sandeep, who were passing nearby. They refused to take any action in response, saying that the crime scene wasn't under their purview as they were from the Hauz Khas police station, and that he would have to report the incident to the station in Vasant Vihar. Shortly after the attacks, Pawan Gupta said he accepted his guilt and should be hanged. Mukesh Singh, who was placed in Tihar Jail after his arrest, was assaulted by other inmates and was kept in solitary confinement for his own protection. Ram Singh was presented before the Metropolitan Magistrate on 18 December 2012. He refused to participate in an identification process. Investigation revealed a history of frequent drinking that resulted in \\"blinding rage\\", \\"bad temper\\", and quarrels with employers, that had led friends to call him \\"mental\\". On 11 March, Ram Singh was discovered hanging from a ventilator shaft in his cell which he shared with 3 other prisoners, at about 5:45 a.m. Authorities said it was unclear whether it was a suicide or a murder. Trial The male victim, Awindra Pratap Pandey, testified in court on 19 December 2012. Pandey recorded his statement with a sub-divisional magistrate at the Safdarjung Hospital on 21 December, in the presence of the Deputy Commissioner of police. On 21 December, the government promised to file the charge sheet quickly and seek the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the perpetrators. Following public outrage and a demand for a speedy trial and prosecution, on 24 December, the police promised to file the charge sheet within one week. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs met on 27 December to discuss the issue, and Union Home Secretary R. K. Singh and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar were summoned to appear. The Delhi High Court approved the creation of five fast-track courts to try rape and sexual assault cases. The first of the five approved fast-track courts was inaugurated on 2 January 2013 by Altamas Kabir, Chief Justice of India, in Saket court complex in South Delhi. On 21 December, the Delhi High Court reprimanded the Delhi police for being \\"evasive\\" in a probe status report providing details of officers on patrol duty in the area covered by the bus route. A further court hearing on the matter was scheduled for 9 January 2013. The following day, the Delhi Police initiated action against three Hauz Khas police station personnel for their inaction in responding to the robbery of the carpenter that took place earlier on the bus in the day. On 24 December, two Assistant Commissioners of Police were suspended for failing to prevent the gang rape incident. Juvenile defendant The juvenile defendant was declared as 17 years and six months old on the day of the crime by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), which relied on his birth certificate and school documents. The JJB rejected a police request for a bone ossification (age determination) test for a positive documentation of his age. On 28 January 2013, the JJB determined that he would not be tried as an adult. A petition moved by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy seeking the prosecution of the minor as an adult because of the violent nature of his alleged crime was rejected by the JJB. The minor was tried separately in a juvenile court. A verdict in the case was scheduled to be announced on 25 July, but was deferred until 5 August and then deferred again to 19 August. On 31 August, he was convicted of rape and murder under the Juvenile Justice Act and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility, inclusive of the eight months he spent in remand during the trial. The juvenile was released on 20 December 2015. For the rehabilitation and mainstreaming of the juvenile as mandated by the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 management committees are set up before the release of juvenile convicts. Accordingly a 'post-release plan' was submitted to the Delhi high court in December 2015. The plan, was prepared and submitted by the management committee, headed by the officer of the District Child Protection Unit, and had recommended that \\"the juvenile should lead a new life with a new identity provided by the appropriate government as applicable in his case if permissible to avoid any backlash or violent reaction\\". According to the report, the juvenile had learnt cooking and tailoring while staying in the reform house. Report further said that the juvenile would need a tailoring shop, a sewing machine and other tailoring equipment. The report also mentioned that a one time grant of from the government should be sufficient to support him initially. The department of women and child development (WCD) of the government, stated that it would provide the money and would arrange the machine from an NGO. The juvenile's family had ostracized him for the crime and refused to accept him. However, after his release it was reported that he was working as a cook. Adult defendants Five days after Jyoti's death, on 3 January 2013, the police filed charges against the five adult men for rape, murder, kidnapping, destruction of evidence, and the attempted murder of the woman's male companion. Senior lawyer Dayan Krishnan was appointed as the special public prosecutor. Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta denied the charges. Some of the men had confessed earlier; however, their lawyers said that their clients had been tortured and that their confessions had been coerced. On 10 January, one of their lawyers, Manohar Lal Sharma, said in a media interview that the victims were responsible for the assault because they should not have been using public transportation and, as an unmarried couple, they should not have been on the streets at night. He went on to say: \\"Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect.\\" He also called the male victim \\"wholly responsible\\" for the incident because he \\"failed in his duty to protect the woman\\". The Delhi police filed a charge sheet against the defendants on 13 March in the robbery of Ram Adhar. The four surviving adult defendants went on trial in a fast- track court. The prosecution presented evidence including witness statements, the victim's statement, fingerprints, DNA testing, and dental modelling. It completed its case on 8 July. Conviction and sentencing On 10 September 2013, in the fast track court of Delhi, the four adult defendants were found guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence.State (Government of NCT of Delhi) vs. Ram Singh & Ors, S.C. No. 114/2013, Judgment The four men faced the death penalty, and demonstrators outside the courthouse called for the hanging of the defendants. The victim's father also called for the defendants to be hanged, stating, \\"We will get complete closure only if all the accused are wiped off from the face of the earth.\\" Lawyers for three of the four stated that their clients intended to appeal the verdict. The four men were sentenced on 13 September to death by hanging.State (Government of NCT of Delhi) vs. Ram Singh & Ors, S.C. No. 114/2013, Order on Sentence Judge Yogesh Khanna rejected pleas for a lesser sentence saying the case has \\"shocked the collective conscience of India\\" and that \\"courts cannot turn a blind eye to such crimes.\\" The victim's family was present for the sentencing and her mother expressed satisfaction over the verdict saying, \\"We were waiting with bated breath, now we are relieved. I thank the people of my country and the media.\\" After the verdict was delivered, the people waiting outside the courtroom applauded. On 13 March 2014, the Delhi High Court found each of the defendants guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence. With the verdict; the High Court confirmed death sentence for the four men convicted in September 2013. The court noted that the crime, which stirred widespread protests over sexual crimes against women in the country, fell into the judicial system's \\"rarest of rare category\\" that allows capital punishment. The lawyers of the four men said they would appeal to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court appeal On 15 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India stayed the execution of two of the four convicts, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta, to allow them to make their appeal against their conviction on 31 March. This was further extended by the court to the second week of July. On 2 June, the two other convicts, Sharma and Thakur, also asked the Supreme Court to stay their execution to allow them to make an appeal of their convictions. On 14 July, their execution was also stayed by Supreme Court. On 27 August 2015, Vinay, Akshay, Mukesh and Pawan were convicted of robbing Ram Adhar and were later sentenced to 10-years imprisonment. On 5 May 2017, the Supreme Court rejected the convicts' appeal and saying they had committed \\"a barbaric crime\\" that had \\"shaken society's conscience,\\" the court upheld the death sentence of the four who had been charged in the murder. The verdict was well received by the family of the victim and the civil society. According to legal experts, the convicts still had the right to file a review petition to the Supreme Court. On 9 July 2018, the Supreme Court rejected a review petition by three of the convicts. In November 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed a review petition from Akshay pleading for mercy. In doing so, the court retained the death sentence. After the verdict, Akshay's lawyer told the Supreme Court that he would appeal to the president. For this, he should be given three weeks time. In January 2020, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court rejected the curative petitions of convicts, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh. On 7 January 2020 a death warrant was issued for the Nirbhaya rapists by a Delhi court, setting an execution date of 22 January 2020 at 7:00a.m. IST in Tihar Jail. Government authorities and the victim's mother alleged that the four convicts were \\"intentionally delaying\\" and \\"frustrating\\" the legal process in this case by filing their pleas in stages, so that the execution could be postponed. Under the prison rules, if a case has more than one convicts awaiting death penalty and one of them moves a mercy plea then the execution of all the convicts would need to be postponed until a decision is made on the pending mercy plea. Mercy plea to the President of India Convict Mukesh filed a mercy plea. The Delhi government made a recommendation to reject the plea and forwarded it to the Lieutenant Governor. Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia stated that this action was taken at \\"lightning speed.\\" On 17 January 2020, the President of India rejected the mercy plea of the convict Mukesh Singh. The home ministry had recommended the president that the plea should be rejected. Second and third death warrants On 17 January 2020, hours after the rejection of the mercy plea, a Delhi court issued a second death warrant for the convicts to be hanged after a mandatory fourteen- day gap on 1 February at 6a.m. The fourteen days' reprieve was provided in accordance with law which states that the convicts awaiting an execution must have a reprieve after their mercy plea is rejected. During the same hearing, the court also rejected a plea by the convict Mukesh to postpone the execution. On 17 January, convict Pawan appealed to the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court order that rejected his claim that Pawan was a juvenile during the crime in 2012. On 31 January, a Delhi court stayed the death warrant. The judge did not issue a fresh warrant for their execution. The lawyer cited Rule 836 of the prison manual which says that in a case where more than one person has been sentenced to death, the execution cannot take place unless all the convicts have exhausted their legal options. On 17 February 2020, a third death warrant was issued by the court with the execution date as 3 March 2020 at 6:00a.m. On 4 March 2020, a fourth death warrant was issued by court with the execution date as 20 March 2020 at 5:30a.m. Numerous pleas and appeals were made by both the families of the convicts and the convicts themselves, including three of the convicts moving the International Court of Justice for a stay on the death sentence; however, the date for the execution remained the same. Execution of convicts On 20 March 2020, at 5:30a.m. IST, the four adult convicts were executed by hanging at Tihar Jail, on a gallows specially designed for four people. According to prison officials, the four convicts refused the offer of a last meal and new clothes prior to their execution. The four were blindfolded and did not resist as they were led to the gallows; however, Vinay Sharma suffered a breakdown prior to his hanging and began pleading with the guards.https://www.rediff.com/news/report/revealed-how-nirbhaya-convicts- spent-last-moments/20200320.htm The four were declared dead after hanging for 30 minutes.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/nirbhaya-convicts-didn-t- resist-when-taken-for-execution-vinay-broke-down-tihar- official-1657957-2020-03-20 Mukesh Singh reportedly requested to donate his organs.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/nirbhaya- convicts-last-wishes-mukesh-seeks-to-donate-organs-vinay-gives-his-paintings- to-jail-super/articleshow/74725240.cms?from=mdr Public protests After the incident Students protest at Raisina Hill, Rajpath, New Delhi Public protests took place in New Delhi on 21 December 2012 at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the latter being the location of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. Thousands of protesters clashed with police and battled Rapid Action Force units. Demonstrators were baton charged, shot with water cannon and tear gas shells, and arrested. Similar protests occurred throughout the country. More than 600 women belonging to various organisations demonstrated in Bangalore. Thousands of people silently marched in Kolkata. Protests occurred online as well on the social networking sites Facebook and WhatsApp, with users replacing their profile images with a black dot symbol. Tens of thousands signed an online petition protesting the incident. Yoga guru Baba Ramdev and former Army chief General Vijay Kumar Singh were among the demonstrators who clashed with Delhi Police at Jantar Mantar. On 24 December, activist Rajesh Gangwar started a hunger strike, saying about the accused men, \\"If my death shakes the system and gets them hanged, I am ready to die\\". Gangwar ended his fast after 14 days, saying, \\"My fight to demand a strict law against rape will be continued in the future... I have dedicated myself for this cause\\". Middle Finger Protests, a Chandigarh-based pressure group and NGO headed by human rights and social activist Prabhloch Singh, also played a key role in the agitations and protests in New Delhi. Police used water cannon and tear gas to attempt to break up the protestors. Seven metro rail stations in New Delhi were closed on 22 December to discourage protesters from gathering at Raisina Hill. On 24 December, police blocked roads leading to India Gate and Raisina Hill to prevent possible mass protests, and closed nine metro stations, affecting thousands of transit patrons. News reporters were not allowed to reach India Gate and Raisina Hill. In addition to CrPC section 144, which disallows assembly of groups larger than five, curfew was imposed near the presidential residence. The Hindustan Times accused police of using excessive force against the protestors, reporting that 375 tear gas canisters were used at India Gate and elsewhere in Delhi to disperse the crowds. An article in First Post criticised the Indian government as well, saying that they failed to act positively or give credible assurances to the protesters and instead used police force, lathi-charging, pushing the media out of the scene, and shutting down metro rail stations. Police stated that peaceful protests had been \\"hijacked\\" by hooligans and political activists. During one protest, a police constable named Subhash Tomar collapsed and later died in hospital. Two witnesses claimed that Tomar collapsed without being hit by any protesters, while a third disputed this. Hospital doctors and the post-mortem gave contradictory reports: he died due to cardiac arrest, but it is not known if the heart attack was caused by blunt-force injuries that he suffered to his chest and neck. Some experts state that his chest injuries may have been a side effect of the administration of CPR. The Delhi Police arrested 8 young men and charged them with Tomar's murder and rioting at India Gate. Later in March 2013, the police admitted in the High Court they had no evidence against the eight and gave them a clean chit. The youths said the move by the commissioner of police to charge them with murder had been \\"irresponsible\\". After the victim's death People in Bangalore protesting outside Bangalore Town Hall on 30 December 2012 After Jyoti Singh's death on 29 December 2012, protests were staged throughout India, including Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam. Many of the mourners carried candles and wore black dress; some pasted black cloth across their mouths. Google published a special Doodle to pay tribute to the victim The following day a large number of people staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area. One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered during the previous week were out of bounds to the public. Some of the protesters drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement. The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on crime against women. New Year's celebrations were scaled down to a large extent, with the Indian armed forces and some clubs and hotels in Delhi cancelling their New Year parties. The Indian protests also sparked protests across South Asia, including marches and rallies in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. In Nepal, hundreds of demonstrators in Kathmandu called for legal reforms and an overhaul of attitudes to women. In Bangladesh the human rights group Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) said the protests in Delhi had given fresh impetus to protests against sexual violence. According to an ASK spokesperson, \\"although previous demonstrations on similar issues were largely dominated by women, men were now protesting too. The protests had also drawn people from a broad range of society.\\" Bidhannagar (\\"Salt Lake City\\") in Kolkata on 29 December 2012 In Paris, people participated in a march to the Indian embassy where a petition was handed over asking for action to make India safer for women. An author for the South Asia Analysis Group explained the protests as expressions of middle-class angst arising out of a collapse of a social contract between them and the liberal state. New Delhi has the highest number of sex crimes among India's major cities. Police figures show a rape reported on average every 18 hours; reported rape cases rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. Only one of the 706 rape cases filed in Delhi in 2012 saw a successful conviction against the attacker. Between 16 December and 4 January 501 calls for harassment and 64 calls for rape were recorded by the Delhi Police, but only four were followed up by inquiries. The regional programme director for U.N. Women South Asia said, \\"There are rape cases in almost all cities and rural areas, where the victim dies immediately because of the brutality of the crime ... This time, it was like, 'Wake up.'\\" Reactions Members of the Indian parliament demanded severe punishment for the perpetrators. The then Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, stated: \\"The rapists should be hanged\\". Chairperson of the then ruling United Progressive Alliance Sonia Gandhi visited the Safdarjang Hospital and met doctors on duty in the anaesthesia and surgery departments for an update on the woman's health. Bahujan Samaj Party chief, Mayawati, said that proper investigation was required, and that \\"action should be so strict that no one should dare to act in such a manner again\\". Actress and member of the Rajya Sabha, Jaya Bachchan said that she was \\"terribly disturbed\\" over the incident, and felt \\"ashamed\\" sitting in the House, feeling \\"helpless\\" for \\"not being able to do anything\\". Meira Kumar, the then Speaker of the Lok Sabha, told reporters a \\"new law should be brought in and must get passed to ensure the safety of women.\\" She went on to say: \\"The laws at present are not enough, we need stricter laws.\\" Sheila Dixit, who at that time was the Chief Minister of Delhi, said that she did not have the courage to meet the victim and described Delhi as a \\"rape capital\\" in interviews. She said that senior police officials should be held accountable for the failure to take adequate measures to stop such incidents and called for \\"immediate setting up of fast-track courts to try rape cases and to get justice in a time-bound manner\\". The three constables who had refused to take action upon Ram Adhar's complaint of robbery were suspended for dereliction of duty. On 24 December 2012, in his first official reaction after the incident, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm, stressing that \\"violence will serve no purpose\\". In a televised address, he assured that all possible efforts would be made to ensure the safety of women in India. Singh expressed empathy, saying: \\"As a father of three daughters I feel as strongly about the incident as each one of you\\". As a tribute to Nirbhaya, the prime minister cancelled all his official events to celebrate the new year. Then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, announced a package of financial assistance and a government job to her family. Speaking out against the protesters, President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit Mukherjee argued that the women protesters did not appear to him to be students, saying, \\"What's basically happening in Delhi is a lot like Egypt or elsewhere, where there's something called the Pink Revolution, which has very little connection with ground realities. In India, staging candle-lit marches, going to discoth√®ques ... I can see many beautiful women among them ‚Äì highly dented-painted ... [but] I have grave doubts whether they're students ...\\" The remark was widely condemned as sexist. His sister Sharmistha said that she and their father the president both disapproved. Then Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan also expressed disapproval. Abhijit quickly withdrew his comment and apologised. Spiritual guru Asaram Bapu also provoked extensive criticism from the public by saying that the victim was also to blame for her own assault because she could have stopped the attack if she had \\"chanted God's name and fallen at the feet of the attackers\\". International The American embassy released a statement on 29 December 2012, offering their condolences to Nirbhaya's family and stated \\"we also recommit ourselves to changing attitudes and ending all forms of gender-based violence, which plagues every country in the world\\". Nirbhaya was posthumously awarded one of the 2013 International Women of Courage Awards of the US State Department. The citation stated that \\"for millions of Indian women, her personal ordeal, perseverance to fight for justice, and her family's continued bravery is helping to lift the stigma and vulnerability that drive violence against women.\\" The crime of rape became a capital offence in India following the rape. Indian politician Mulayam Singh Yadav opposed this change in the law, saying that \\"Boys will be boys. Boys commit mistakes\\". Two years later, in response to these comments and another incident of rape that took place in Uttar Pradesh where Yadav's party was governing, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said \\"We say no to the dismissive, destructive attitude of, 'Boys will be boys'\\". and stated, \\"Violence against women must never be accepted, never excused, never tolerated. Every girl and woman has the right to be respected, valued and protected\\". UN Women called on the Government of India and the Government of Delhi \\"to do everything in their power to take up radical reforms, ensure justice and reach out with robust public services to make women's lives more safe and secure\\". Students voice for women after the 2012 Delhi gang rape In the wake of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US commentators exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder was a turning point in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India at the time of the rape and murder and she commented: > After having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual > violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke > through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every > paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the > college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. > And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for > the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. > They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of > patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence. Tourism In the aftermath of the rape case the number of female tourists fell by 35% compared to the period the previous year according to an industry survey by ASSOCHAM. The Foreign Office of the UK modified its travel advice and advised women against travelling alone. In 2014, Finance minister Arun Jaitley commented that one small incident of rape in Delhi' advertised world- over is enough to cost us billions of dollars in terms of lower tourism\\". Results of protests In the view of widespread protests, governments at the centre and various states announced several steps to ensure the safety of women. The Government of Karnataka announced the launch of a 24/7 dedicated helpline (1091) to be operated by the state police to register sexual abuse complaints from women. It also is checking the possibility of setting up fast- track courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women. The Government of Tamil Nadu also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials. The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual abuse cases in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted fast-track courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels. The Jammu and Kashmir government also announced plans to change the state's laws against sexual offences and gender crimes. The Government of Himachal Pradesh decided to set up state and district-level committees to review progress of all cases of crimes against women. Justice Verma Committee and changes in law On 22 December 2012, a judicial committee headed by J. S. Verma, a former Chief Justice of India and one of India's most highly regarded Chief Justices and eminent jurists, was appointed by the Central government to submit a report within 30 days to suggest amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with sexual assault cases. The committee urged the public in general and particularly eminent jurists, legal professionals, NGOs, women's groups and civil society to share \\"their views, knowledge and experience suggesting possible amendments in the criminal and other relevant laws to provide for quicker investigation, prosecution and trial, and also enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault of an extreme nature against women.\\" The Committee held its first meeting on 26 December 2012; it had received more than 6,000 emails with suggestions by then. The Justice Verma Committee report was submitted after 29 days, after considering 80,000 suggestions received during the period. The report indicated that failures on the part of the government and police were the root cause behind crimes against women. Suggestions in the report included the need to review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) in conflict areas, and setting the maximum punishment for rape as death penalty rather than life imprisonment. The committee did not favour lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16. On 26 December 2012, a Commission of Inquiry headed by former Delhi High Court judge Usha Mehra was set up to identify lapses, determine responsibility in relation to the incident, and suggest measures to make Delhi and the wider National Capital Region safer for women. On 1 January 2013, a task force headed by the Union Home Secretary was established to look into women's safety issues in Delhi and review the functioning of the city police force on a regular basis. On 3 February 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by President Pranab Mukherjee. It provides for amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences. The ordinance provides for the death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalisation of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law. In a December 2013 interview, Nirbhaya's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, said they were trying to get the juvenile law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court. The juvenile defendant was sent to borstal youth detention for three years and then released. He was just short of 18 years when he committed the crime. In a March 2015 interview with The Tribune, Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi said that Government is going ahead with a law treating juveniles as adults in grave crimes. On 22 December 2015, Rajya Sabha passed the Juvenile Justice Bill, which proposed that the accused who are above 16 years of age will be treated as an adult in the court of law. Legacy Anniversary memorials On 16 December 2013, the anniversary of the attack, activists held memorials throughout New Delhi in memory of the victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning \\"fearless\\". Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where Nirbhaya and her friend Pandey boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place. At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: \\"... whatever you will want in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future\\". The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe \\"has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them\\". In December 2014, the two-year anniversary of the attack, referring to a woman who was raped in a car operated by an Uber driver, the parents remarked to the press that not much had changed: \\"Nothing in India has changed since December 16, 2012. All promises and statements made by our leaders and ministers have turned out to be shallow. Our suffering gives them their moment in limelight. My daughter asks me what I have done to get her justice. She asks what am I doing so that many more like her get justice and I wake up to realise how helpless and trivial I am...\\" \\"Nirbhaya Chetna Diwas\\", a public event organised by women's and citizens groups, candle light vigils, prayer meetings, and other events were held on 16 December 2015 at the Jantar Mantar to pay homage to Jyoti on the third anniversary of her death. In what was called \\"a brave homage to her daughter\\", Jyoti's mother, Asha Devi, said, \\"My daughter's name was Jyoti Singh and I am not ashamed to name her. Those who commit heinous crimes like rape, their heads should hang in shame, not the victims' or their families'.\\" Devi spoke out against the upcoming release of the juvenile and put forth four demands for justice: > On the third death anniversary of our death, we are seeing the release of > the juvenile convict. Where is justice in that? I do not know whether he is > 16 or 18. I only know that he has committed a brutal crime and there should > be no age limit for punishment; [...] the juvenile convict should be > sentenced to death, fast-track courts be set up in all the courts to offer > speedy justice to sexual assault victims, amendments to the Juveniles > Justice Act be passed and utilisation of Nirbhaya Fund for setting up high > quality forensic labs in all states. Changes to the legal system The outpouring of anger and grief following the rape and murder gave rise to hopes for change in India. The government responded with the passage of several new sexual assault laws, including a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for gang rape, and six new fast-track courts created solely for rape prosecutions. As an indicator of the scope of the problem of rape prosecution, the \\"Nirbhaya\\" case was the only conviction obtained among the 706 rape cases filed in New Delhi in 2012. Between 16 December 2012 and 4 January 2013, Delhi police recorded 501 allegations of harassment and 64 of rape, but only four inquiries were launched. However, it appears that the \\"Nirbhaya\\" case has had an effect on the willingness of rape or molestation victims to report the crime; police records show that during the final nine months of 2013 almost twice as many rape victims filed a police report and four times as many allegations of molestation were made. A recent report released by the National Crime Records Bureau shows that 95 percent of the cases brought to the police were classified as a crime. However, there is a large backlog of cases with fewer than 15 percent of those charged tried in 2012, leaving 85 percent waiting to come to trial. On 16 December 2013, the one-year anniversary of the rape was commemorated in London with a public memorial to honour the victim. Speakers included Meera Syal, whose parents are from New Delhi. Speaking of the anger that was expressed at the time of the rape, she said, \\"We need to hold onto that anger and demand that the Indian Government enforces all the promised changes of its recent Criminal Law Amendment Act, which changed laws to expand the definition of rape and incorporated new offences including acid attack, sexual harassment, voyeurism and stalking\\". She also said that activists need to act in solidarity with other organisations to stop violence against women and girls around the world. Following the incident the government set up the Nirbhaya Fund to address violence against women. The Fund is administered by Department of Economic Affairs of the finance ministry. However, as of March 2015, very little of the funds have been spent to ensure women's safety. Public discussions about violence against women Observers agree that the victim's ordeal has brought a change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests at the time of the rape said a year later, \\"A welcome change is that the taboo on discussing rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes.\\" She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw \\"absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant.\\" She added, \\"I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure\\". A poll in October 2017, the first of its kind in the world, which was published by Thomson Reuters Foundation, found that Delhi was the fourth most dangerous city in the world for women and it was also the worst city in the world for women when it came to sexual violence, rape and harassment. Nirbhaya Trust In December 2013, the family of the victim along with social entrepreneur Sarvesh Kumar Tiwari established the Nirbhaya Trust, an institute formed to assist women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance. Due to the fact that Indian laws do not allow the publishing of a rape victim's name, it was named Nirbhaya which means fearless in Hindi, after the name used by the media. The victim's father stated, \\"So many people supported us, so ... we want [to] help those girls who have no one.\\" BBC Storyville: India's Daughter India's Daughter (2015) is a documentary film directed and produced by Leslee Udwin, and is part of the BBC's ongoing Storyville series. It was scheduled to be broadcast on International Women's Day, 8 March 2015, in India on NDTV 24x7 and in UK on BBC Four. On 1 March, it was revealed that the filmmakers had interviewed one of the rapists while he was being held in the Tihar jail. Soon, the news was picked up by Indian media outlets. The Indian government blocked its broadcast in India by obtaining a court order on 4 March. The BBC said it would comply with the order and did not broadcast the film in India. In the UK however, the BBC moved the transmission forward to 4 March, and it was shown on that date. The film was also uploaded on YouTube and soon went viral with various shares on social media. On 5 March, the Indian government directed YouTube to block the video in India and YouTube complied with the order. The film has generated a great deal of controversy in both India and worldwide. Because India does not permit a rape victim's name to be published, the victim was called \\"Nirbhaya\\", which means fearless, because of her efforts to fight off her rapists and her insistence on making a detailed statement to the police before she died. However, following the death of their daughter, the parents were quoted in several media articles as saying they had no objections to using their daughter's name. In the film the father states he is \\"happy\\" to reveal her name, Jyoti Singh, and on 5 March the father was quoted as saying he thought \\"everyone should watch the documentary, which showed 'the bitter truth' about attitudes to women in India\\". Even still, on 6 March, the news outlet The Hindu ran an article \\"Father objects to revealing gangrape victim's name in 'India's Daughter'\\" in which they quoted the father as saying that he planned to take legal action because her name was used. The film's director and producer Leslee Udwin said that it was the courage and bravery shown by the unprecedented numbers of men and women who protested the rape and murder that inspired her to make the film. Speaking in an interview, Udwin said: > Courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of India braved the > December freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers, withstanding an > onslaught of teargas shells, lathi charges [baton charges] and water canons, > to make their cry of 'enough is enough' heard. In this regard, India led the > world by example. In my lifetime, I can't recall any other country standing > up with such commitment and determination for women's rights. In reference to the actual film, Nirbhaya's father, Badrinath Singh, has stated that India's Daughter \\"holds up a mirror to society\\", and that the screening of the film holds a significance in the sense \\"that the struggle that my daughter was part of continues.\\" Singh has also stated that since the death of his daughter \\"every girl on the street is [now] like a daughter\\" to him and his wife, and that people in general need to understand that their sons need to be taught to respect women. Speaking on 5 March, Singh said: > My wife and I brought up our children with the sole intention of making them > good citizens. I can proudly say that we have achieved that. Our daughter > has shown society its true face. She has changed the lives of many young > girls. She remains an inspiration even after her death. She fought back > those devils. We are proud of our daughter. In the media Richie Mehta, a Canadian filmmaker, made a seven part web television series titled Delhi Crime in 2019. It was based on the aftermath and the subsequent manhunt of the perpetrators of the case. Starring Shefali Shah, Rasika Duggal and Adil Hussain, the series was released on Netflix. Literary works Wo desh ki beti' (The daughter of the Nation), poems written and narrated by Sunil Kumar Verma, depicting the national pain at the gang rape of its daughters Motivated by Jyoti's rape and murder, Ram Devineni, Lina Srivastava, and Dan Goldman released the comic book Priya's Shakti. The storyline of the comic focuses on Priya, a human woman and ardent devotee of the Goddess Parvati, who has experienced a brutal rape and the social stigma and isolation resulting from it. Inspired by the goddess, Priya fights against gender-based sexual violence in India and around the world, supporting the movement against patriarchy and misogyny. A book on the Nirbhaya case titled Courting Injustice: The Nirbhaya Case and its Aftermath was authored by Rajesh Talwar, and published by Hay House in 2013 On 5 September 2014, Bandaru Dattareya, a member of Parliament and BJP National Vice President, inaugurated \\"Wo Desh Ki Beti\\" (Nation's Daughter), a social event at Hyderabad showcasing a collection of sixteen poems authored by Sunil Kumar Verma which depicted the pain of a nation at the gang rape of its daughters.

Description The property is stocked with approximately 12,000 head of Brahman cattle, with a capacity of 15,000 and is broken up into 28 paddocks with an average size of . Litchfield shares 12 holding paddocks, 6 permanent steel yards, 15 bores and a bitumen airstrip with neighbouring Tipperary. There numerous watering points in the form of creeks, springs and swamps scattered around the property which can dry up before the onset of the wet season, making the cattle dependent on bores for a small part of the year. A floodplain that contains para grass and marine couch backed onto the Daly River mouth makes up part of Litchfield. The forested higher country is bound by the Reynolds River which is the boundary of Litchfield National Park. History Litchfield was acquired by Melbourne- based barrister Alan Myers QC in 2003 for 50million along with the 80,000 cattle. Myers also acquired Tipperary, Fish River and Elizabeth Downs stations. The Australian Agricultural Company offered 105 million to acquire Tipperary and Litchfield stations along with the 60,000 head of cattle in 2009, but the shareholder voted against the acquisition at an extraordinary general meeting held three months later. In 2011, Australian Agricultural company purchased the Tipperary group's cattle herd of 53,000 head for 26 million, and also entered a one-year agreement to use the station group for agistment purposes with options to extend. David Warriner, the head of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, is still managing the group in 2012 which was stocked with 70,000 cattle raised for live export to Indonesia.

Andy McKeague of Monsters and Critics felt that the film is genuinely unsettling and morbidly fascinating at the same time. Mike Bracken of IGN criticized the film, saying that EM Embalming's greatest failure is that it often tries to be too many things at once and the film itself is almost as schizophrenic as its antagonist. However, he felt that several sequences of the embalming process are gruesome and extended conversations between Miyako and the black market organ harvester are eerily intriguing. Meanwhile, Mark Schilling of The Japan Times said: \\"While verging on a black comic turn, Toshio Shiba's performance as Dr. Fuji is the film's strongest; his dark night of the soul is not just another fashionably blank attitude, but the genuine article, forged in the satanic mills of anger, loathing and despair.\\" References External links * * Category:Films directed by Shinji Aoyama Category:1990s psychological horror films Category:Japanese horror films Category:Japanese films Category:1999 horror films Category:1999 films ","title":"EM Embalming"},{"id":"37982627","text":"Abu'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla () was the third Hamdanid ruler of the Emirate of Aleppo. He succeeded his father Sa'd al-Dawla in 991, but throughout his reign real power rested in the hands of Sa'd al-Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu', to whose daughter Sa'id was wed. His reign was dominated by the Fatimid Caliphate's repeated attempts to conquer Aleppo, which was prevented only by the intervention of the Byzantine Empire. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued existence as a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in January 1002 Sa'id al-Dawla died, possibly poisoned by Lu'lu', and Lu'lu' assumed control of Aleppo in his own name.  Life and reign  Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty Sa'id al- Dawla's father, Sa'd al-Dawla, had only with difficulty managed to first secure a measure of control over his domains, and then to maintain a precarious autonomy by manoeuvring between the Byzantine Empire, the Fatimids of Egypt, and the Buyids in Iraq, alternating between warfare and recognizing the suzerainty of each power in turn. The once-proud emirate, which under Sa'id al-Dawla's grandfather Sayf al-Dawla included all of northern Syria and much of the Jazira, had now shrunk to the region around Aleppo. Sa'd al- Dawla's domestic position was precarious, and his state was impoverished and militarily impotent. After the Byzantine‚ÄìFatimid peace of 987/8, he came to depend once more on the Byzantines, and it was Byzantine troops that helped him defeat a Fatimid-sponsored attempt to seize Aleppo by the former Hamdanid governor Bakjur in April 991. Following Sa'd al-Dawla's death in December 991, his young son Abu'l-Fada'il, known by the laqab of \\"Sa'id al-Dawla\\", succeeded him as emir. Sa'id al-Dawla was under the influence of his chief minister and later father-in-law, Lu'lu', who continued to support the alliance with the Byzantines. Many of his rivals, resenting his power, defected upon Sa'd al- Dawla's death to the Fatimids, who now resumed their attacks on Aleppo. As M. Canard writes, \\"the history of [Sa'id al-Dawla's] reign is almost exclusively that of the attempts of Fatimid Egypt to gain the emirate of Aleppo, which were opposed by the Byzantine emperor\\". Encouraged by the Hamdanid defectors, the Fatimid caliph al-Aziz launched a first attack in 992, under the governor of Damascus, the Turkish general Manjutakin. The Fatimid general invaded the emirate, defeated a Byzantine force under the doux of Antioch, Michael Bourtzes, in June 992, and laid siege to Aleppo. He failed to pursue the siege with vigour, however, and the city was easily able to resist until, in the spring of 993, after thirteen months of campaigning, Manjutakin was forced to return to Damascus due to lack of supplies. In spring 994, Manjutakin launched another invasion, again defeated Bourtzes at the Battle of the Orontes, took Homs, Apamea and Shayzar and besieged Aleppo for eleven months. The blockade was far more effective this time and soon caused a severe lack of food. Sa'id al-Dawla suggested surrendering to Manjutakin, but the determined stance of Lu'lu'allowed the city's defenders to hold out until the sudden arrival of the Byzantine emperor, Basil II, in Syria in April 995. Basil, who had been campaigning in Bulgaria, had responded to the Hamdanids' plea for aid, and crossed Asia Minor in only sixteen days at the head of an army 13,000 strong; his sudden arrival caused panic in the Fatimid army: Manjutakin burned his camp and retreated to Damascus without battle. Sa'id al-Dawla and Lu'lu' prostrated themselves before the emperor in person as a sign of gratitude and submission, and he in turn released the emirate from its obligation to pay an annual tribute. Basil's interest in Syria was limited, however, and after a brief campaign that saw an unsuccessful attack on Tripoli, returned to Constantinople. Al-Aziz on the other hand now prepared for all-out war with the Byzantines, but his preparations were cut short by his death in October 996. The Byzantine‚ÄìFatimid contest over Syria continued, however, with alternating success. In 995, Lu'lu' made terms with al-Aziz and acknowledged him as Caliph, and for a few years Fatimid influence over Aleppo grew. In 998 Lu'lu' and Sa'id al-Dawla tried to seize the fortress of Apamea, but were thwarted by the new Byzantine doux, Damian Dalassenos. Dalassenos' defeat and death in a battle with the Fatimids shortly after caused another intervention by Basil in the next year, which stabilized the situation and strengthened Aleppo's security from Fatimid attack by placing a Byzantine garrison at Shayzar. The conflict ended with another treaty in 1001 and the conclusion of a ten-year truce. In January 1002, Sa'id al-Dawla died, although according to a tradition recorded by Ibn al-Adim, he was poisoned by one of his concubines at the behest of Lu'lu'. Along with his son Mansur, Lu'lu' now assumed direct power, at first as ostensible guardians over Sa'id al-Dawla's sons Abu'l-Hasan Ali and Abu'l-Ma'ali Sharif, until, in 1003/4, he had them exiled to Egypt. At the same time, one of Sa'id al-Dawla's brothers, Abu'l-Hayja, fled, disguised as a woman, to the Byzantine court. Lu'lu' was a capable ruler who maintained the balance between Byzantium and the Fatimids, but after his death in 1008/9 Aleppo gravitated increasingly towards the latter. A Hamdanid restoration attempt, led by Abu'l-Hayja, failed, and in 1015/6 Mansur ibn Lu'lu' was in turn deposed, ending the last vestiges of the Hamdanid rule in Aleppo.

He is the prototype of the new gentleman in the 19th century: a self-made man who makes his fortune by hard work rather than inheritance. Character Over eight years before the novel opens, Frederick Wentworth travelled to Somerset after being made commander in consequence of the British naval action off St Domingo (1806). He was not immediately sent back to sea, but went to stay with his brother, Reverend Edward Wentworth, ashore as the curate of Monkford. Frederick and Anne fell in love and got engaged. Later, Anne broke off the engagement on the advice of her godmother, Lady Russell, who saw him as an unsuitable choice due to his lack of fortune and connections, as well as his enrollment in a dangerous profession. Further, Anne was young and might have more choices in her future. Disappointed and resentful, Wentworth left the area. Captain Wentworth returns from the Napoleonic Wars in 1814, successful, and with prize money of 25,000 pounds to his credit. Anne's conditions have also changed as her father, a spendthrift baronet, has to lease his country house, Kellynch Hall, to Admiral and Mrs Croft, and move to Bath to lower his expenses. Anne currently is visiting her married younger sister, Mary Musgrove, at Uppercross. Mrs Croft is sister to Frederick Wentworth, and he visits her once she and her husband are settled. Captain Wentworth has not forgiven Anne. Without much thought, he is sociable and most gentlemanly with both Musgrove sisters, Henrietta and Louisa, sisters to Mary's husband Charles, seeing Anne often as part of the Uppercross social circle. Henrietta re-connects with her fianc√©, Charles Hayter. Wentworth talks about a firm mind, influencing Louisa to be more demanding than usual. When others talk to him as if his engagement to Louisa is all but announced, he realizes from honour that he must marry her if she so wishes. Captain Wentworth is aware of Anne, and listens to what others say about her. He learns that she turned down an offer of marriage from Charles Musgrove about five years earlier, which startles him. Anne guards her emotions for each encounter with Frederick in the group of friends at Uppercross. A trip to Lyme with the Musgrove family to meet Captains Harville and Benwick changes everything. There Louisa meets with a serious accident; Anne's immediate help and level-headed behaviour makes Wentworth realize his folly of letting appearances get ahead of his intentional choices. Once Louisa is settled for her long recovery with the Harvilles, Wentworth goes off for a long visit with his now-married brother Edward in Shropshire. He begins to realise that his pride, hurt by the rejection by Anne, may be blocking his best chance, and his love for Anne is allowed to surface again. Benwick residing with the Harville family, having been engaged to Harville's sister who died before they could marry, stays while Louisa slowly recovers. When Louisa is recovered, the news spreads that Captain Benwick is engaged to her. Safe and independent, Frederick Wentworth goes to Bath to win Anne back, only to spy a competitor in Mr Elliot, the inheritor of Kellynch Hall. They meet at a few gatherings, with brief moments to speak with each other. At a gathering of the Musgroves in a Bath hotel, he overhears Captain Harville and Anne talk about the relative faithfulness of men and women. Deeply moved by Anne's words he writes her a letter and makes sure she sees it. They reconcile and renew their love and engagement. He learns in those discussions that when he had come ashore in 1808 (\\"the year eight\\"), after winning his step to Captain and with his first prize money, had he written to her, would she have replied? Yes, she would have replied and renewed the engagement. He realises how he has been his own enemy in this. In the end they marry and live a happy life. Nothing remains to blight their happiness other than a future war, when the Navy might call him back to a ship. Literary significance Captain Frederick Wentworth is the prototype of the 'new gentleman.' Maintaining the good manners, consideration, and sensitivity of the older type, Wentworth adds the qualities of gallantry, independence, and bravery that come with being a well-respected Naval officer. He has made his own fortune through hard work and good sense, in direct contrast to Sir Walter who has only wasted the money that came to him through his title. Without land or high birth, Captain Wentworth is not the traditional match for a woman of Anne Elliot's position. But in true Austenian fashion, his fine personal qualities are enough to surmount the divide which separates his social position from that of Anne. In the novel, Captain Wentworth's character develops, eventually overcoming his resentment at being once refused, in order to make another ardent overture to his chosen bride. This development is sign of a promising future for their relationship. Like Admiral Croft, who allows his wife to drive the carriage alongside him and to help him steer, Captain Wentworth will defer to Anne throughout their marriage. Austen envisions this kind of equal partnership as the ideal marriage, within the limits of 18th century social customs. Margaret Wilson sees Wentworth as combining the dynamic character of Austen's earlier diversionary men and the steadfast qualities needed in a husband. Wentworth's love letter The love letter written by Captain Wentworth is notable: \\"I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W. \\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never.\\" The letter comes near the end of the novel, leading Anne and Frederick to renew their love.

It was previously well known as a condom manufacturer but sold that division in 2017. History  Early years  Ansell was formed as Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company of Australasia Ltd in 1899, when the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company of the United Kingdom incorporated its Australian branch, formed in 1893, and floated it on the Australian stock exchanges. In 1906 the company changed its name to the Dunlop Rubber Company of Australasia Ltd, and in 1929 changed it again, following a merger with the Perdriau Rubber Company, to Dunlop Perdriau Ltd. At this time the company's main business was the production of automobile tyres. The company expanded into other rubber products, including footwear in 1948. In 1967, the company changed its name to Dunlop Australia, and continued to diversify. In 1969 Dunlop Australia acquired the Ansell Rubber Company, which had been founded in 1929 (originally as E. N. Ansell & Sons) by Eric Norman Ansell, at the time a worker for Dunlop Rubber Company of Australasia. Ansell started out developing condoms before moving into other areas such as gas masks and weather balloons as well as developing the first mass-produced disposable latex gloves. Dunlop Australia continued to expand. In 1980 it acquired a competitor and became known as Dunlop Olympic, and in 1986 changed its name to Pacific Dunlop, reflecting its geographic expansion. In 1986 it entered into a joint venture with Goodyear Tire to manufacture and distribute tyres in Australasia. Pacific Dunlop diversified into clothing, batteries, healthcare products and food, and by the mid-1990s was one of the 20 largest companies in Australia, with operations in 20 countries. In the later 1990s, Pacific suffered from falling profits and a high debt burden. It began a programme of divestment, selling its food and battery businesses. The clothing and footwear businesses were floated off as Pacific Brands in 2001, and the company determined to focus on the healthcare products of its Ansell subsidiary. Finally, in 2002, the company changed its name to Ansell Limited.

Her tenure as minister was marked by significant efforts to reform key sectors within the healthcare system including notably the health insurance sector. One key priority was to secure the re-establishment of a unitary system of public health insurance. Zvolenska announced her resignation on 3 November in response to a controversy regarding financial irregularities.  Early life and education  Zuzana Zvolensk√° was born 27 January 1972 in Bratislava, then apart of Czechoslovakia. In 1995 she graduated from the Law Faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava and started working in the banking and insurance sector.  Early career  In 2002, she joined the National Health Insurance (). In 2006 she was promoted to deputy Director General, as well as promoted to the Board of Directors. At the General Assembly that same year, in September 2006, she was elected as President of the Board and General Director. In 2008, she was appointed Director-General and the Chairperson of the Board of the state-owned main health insurance provider General Health Insurance Company (). Since October 2010 she was a member of the Official Board of Insurance Trust, and from February 2011 she worked at the Office of the Adviser for Health Surveillance. Following the 2012 elections, President Ivan Gasparovic appointed her Minister of Health on 4 April 2012 as part of the government of Robert Fico. Zvolensk√° was not a member of the Smer-SD party and she was nominated for the ministerial post as an expert from outside.  Minister of Health   Labor disputes  Immediately after her appointment as health minister, her department inherited several ongoing labor disputes, primarily with doctors and nurses in the public health service. As her ministry set about with far- reaching reforms, with the stated goal of improving insurance coverage as well as reducing overall health-care costs for patients, hospital employees unions voiced their anger over low salaries. The dispute was a continuation from the previous administration, who in late 2011 declared a state of emergency when industrial lockouts and wildcat strikes at public hospitals threatened to shut down the health sector. The situation flared up again in December 2012, when doctors at Zilina University Hospital launched a new strike, where they en masse handed in their resignations, with hundreds more across the country threatening to do the same, should the situation go unresolved. Responding to the incident, Zvolenska said the decision to strike was \\"immoral and un- ethical\\", and said \\"the right to strike does not exceed the right to healthcare nor the right to life\\". She also confirmed that the health ministry was considering legal action against the strikers. In January 2013 the health ministry agreed to raise the salary of doctors by 20%, calming the dispute. This was given final approval by the Cabinet in April. A raise in nurses salaries was also approved, but was struck down by the Constitutional court. In the aftermath of the dispute, Zvolenska's ministry introduced a law, which made dodging work, or going on phony sick-leave punishable by up to three years in prison. Although this was later reduced to a ‚Ç¨3,300 fine, after yet another round of dispute with the health worker unions.  Health insurance reform  A plan to reform Slovakia's health insurance system, from a plural system into a singular system with one National health care provider had been on the books with the Smer party since their previous term ending in 2010. The plan involved the state purchasing or expropriating all the private health insurance operators on the market and uniting them into one, which would then be run by the health ministry under Zvolenska. On October 31, 2012, the cabinet of Robert Fico gave the \\"unitary health insurer project\\" tailored by the Zvolenska its blessing. Zvolenska listed three ways in which it can create a single health insurance company: acquiring the shares of the private health insurance companies, taking over the management of the private insurers‚Äô client portfolios, and expropriating the private health insurers for an appropriate sum, with the first option cited as the best alternative. If the government reaches an agreement with the private insurers about the sale of their shares, the single health insurer could be launched as of January 1, 2014. In the event of expropriation, the single insurer would not emerge until July 2014. Not unexpected, the plan faced massive resistance from the private sector insurance companies. The plans caused controversy when Achmea, a Dutch private insurance group, filed a lawsuit against the Slovak state, after legislation was passed prohibiting it from extracting profits. The international court of arbitration ruled against Slovakia, and awarded Achmea ‚Ç¨30 million. After running into further legal and financial setbacks, the time-line of the project was revised to last through 2015 at the earliest. According to economical and political analysts, the poor state of government finances was the reason for the delays. In February 2014, the reform plan was pushed back indefinitely. The plan had already hit a raw nerve with the two private health insurers operating on the Slovak market, Zvolenska said the project was ready but it would not progress until the funding is secured. In response, Finance Minister Peter Ka≈æim√≠r said ‚ÄúAs the manager of the state treasury I have to say today that we do not have the money for it.\\"  Primary health-care reform  In April 2013, Zvolenska's ministry introduced a law which reintroduced the system, in which patients were required to visit their primary physician first, in order to be referred to a specialist. This was in order to avoid situations were patients visited several outpatient clinics for a single problem, thus duplicating examinations, as well as to improve the general quality of the health-care service. The parliamentary opposition, namely the SDKU said the changes amounted to \\"bullying\\" () and \\"harassment\\" of the patient. This was denied by Zvolenska.  Controversies   \\"CT-scanner case\\" and resignation  On 30 October 2014, the private news outlet Mark√≠za reported that the Alexander Winter Hospital in Pie≈°≈•any had sought in 2012 to purchase a CT-scanner produced by Siemens for ‚Ç¨1 million, but the tender was stopped after the March 2012 parliamentary elections due to the change of the top management. The new management, which included top Smer- SD officials, announced a new round of bidding and subsequently chose another device produced by Philips for ‚Ç¨1.6 million. The price was approximately three times higher than similar devices in neighbouring Czech Republic; for example, a hospital in the Czech town of Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod had recently bought a similar CT scanner for around ‚Ç¨540,000. The Hospital management did not explain why the new CT scanner was so expensive and its secretariat responded that hospital director was on vacation and unable to comment. Zvolenska responded by replacing all the members of the managing board of the hospital nominated by the Health Ministry, arguing that they have not informed her properly about the proceedings in this hospital. She has also filed a complaint with the Supreme Audit Office (NK√ö) and the Public Procurement Office (√öVO) to check whether the tender was in line with the rules. On 4 November, just days after the story broke, prime minister Fico publicly called for Zvolenska's resignation along with Deputy Speaker of Parliament Ren√°ta Zmajkoviƒçov√°, who was chairperson of the board of directors at the hospital. Fico stated \\"The process of the [public] procurement of the CT device in Pie≈°≈•any raises doubts and it is not enough to react to those doubts by sacking the members of the board of directors, which has already happened, the one who manages these people must also leave\\". On 6 November Zvolenska offered her resignation and was replaced by state secretary Viliam ƒåisl√°k.  Personal life  She is married to Ladislav Zvolensk√Ω and together they have one son, named Juraj, who currently attends elementary school. She is fluent in English and Russian.

He is the author of a non-fiction book titled India Becoming, which was selected by The New Yorker and The New Republic as a Best Book of 2012; by Newsweek as one of its three Must Reads on Modern India; and by the New York Times Book Review as an \\"Editors' Choice.\\" The book was short listed for the Shakti Bhatt Prize, and an episode from the book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine. In 2018, Kapur was awarded a Whiting Nonfiction Grant for work on his upcoming book, titled Better to Have Gone (Scribner). Early life and education Kapur was born to an Indian father and American mother and raised near Auroville. He attended boarding school in the United States when he was sixteen. Kapur graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University with a major in Social Anthropology. He has a DPhil in Socio-Legal Studies from Oxford University (Nuffield College), which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar. He also attended the SAIIER (Sri Aurobindo International Institute of Educational Research) school in Auroville, where he grew up, and Phillips Academy, Andover. Career Writing and Journalism Kapur has published in a variety of newspapers and magazines, including The Atlantic, The Economist, Granta, The New York Times, Outlook, The New Yorker, and Time magazine. He is the former \\"Letter from India\\" columnist for the International New York Times. In 2010, his columns for the New York Times received an \\"Honorable Mention\\" award by The Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA), which praised Kapur's \\"brilliant accounts of developments in modern India.\\" In Time magazine, Pico Iyer wrote that India Becoming was \\"impressively lucid and searching\\" and added that, \\"In his clarity, sympathy and impeccably sculpted prose, Kapur often summons the spirit of V.S. Naipaul.\\" In 2018, Kapur was awarded a Whiting Nonfiction Grant for his work on an upcoming book. The book, titled Better to Have Gone, is due to be published by Scribner. In its citation, the prize jury stated: \\"This book is a moving fusion of memoir, history, and ethnography that will inject new life into these forms. As an investigation into an unsolved mystery, it is compelling; as a meditation on the promise and the limitations of utopianism, it could have global resonance. The writing is unornamented, plangent, and affecting. By evoking the everyday in precise detail, Kapur brings utopianism as lived practice to technicolor life. In attempting to locate the shifting border between extremism and idealism, he has written a book rooted in memory but in dialogue with the present day.\\" Kapur has spoken several times on NPR radio in America, public radio in Australia, and NDTV in India. Kapur speaks fluent French, and has also spoken on several radio and TV programs in France, including on France 24, France Inter, and Radio France Internationale. India Becoming was published in France in mid-2014, under the title L'Inde de Demain (Albin Michel). In addition to writing on India, Kapur has also written on a variety of other issues. His travel writing has appeared in Conde Nast Traveller and The Atlantic, and includes reports from Romania, Poland, Turkey Switzerland, and Thailand.  Utopia  Kapur grew up in the utopian community of Auroville and his writing has increasingly addressed the topic of utopia and the search for alternatives. In an article in The New Yorker magazine titled \\"The Return of the Utopians,\\" he has expressed skepticism about the potential of lasting change being achieved through utopian movements, calling instead for a focus on incrementalism and \\"meliorism.\\" However, in an article from The Financial Times on the possibility of achieving a universal basic income, he expresses a less skeptical approach, citing utopia's value as a means of diagnosing the ills of society. Kapur is reported to be working on a narrative book about utopia set in Auroville. In 2018, he published a collected anthology of writings from Auroville, titled Auroville: Dream and Reality, which examines the utopian ambition and its realization in the community. The book's publication coincided with Auroville's fiftieth anniversary. In an interview about the book with Conde Nast Traveller, Kapur writes of his increased interest and faith in the idealism associated with utopia. In an interview for The Indian Express, he says that: \\"Appreciating Auroville requires a certain duality in perspective. It means recognising and cherishing the ideals, while at the same time recognising that the city as it exists today.\\" Technology and Society Kapur's PhD thesis at Oxford focused on the effects of new technologies on economic and social development. He has consulted for a variety of organizations on related topics, including the United Nations Development Program and The Markle Foundation. Recently, he was named a non-residential Senior Fellow at The GovLab, New York University, an organization that explores the intersection of technology and governance. He is also a member of the Academic Council of Krea University, a new university in India that seeks to reimagine liberal arts for the twenty first century.

In his job at bd Systems, Parkin developed PC-based programs for simulating Earth orbit surveillance, launch vehicle performance, SDI particle-beam targeting, missile-warfare scenarios, and ASAT coverage. bd Systems was a provider of aerospace engineering and information technology (IT) services. In the 1980s he worked at National Technical Systems where he set up and ran one of the few approved solar thermal panel testing facilities in the United States. Parkyn's technical expertise was wide-ranging and included the fields of: nonimaging optics, optical engineering, thermal engineering, solar energy and patent drafting. Parkyn was a prolific inventor and his list of patents is extensive. He was one of the inventors of the modern TIR (Total Internal Reflection) lens as exemplified by US patent 5676453 issued in 1997 with his co-inventor Dr. David Pelka. He and Dr. Pelka collaborated on a number of inventions over a period of several decades. Parkin was also a co-inventor with the famous Dr. Roland Winston (US 6177761) on a patent to better extract and radiate light from LEDs. Parkyn collaborated on many inventions with researchers at the company Light Prescriptions Innovators (USA and Spain) and Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid from 2000 to 2012. Overall, Parkyn held 23 patents.http://www.patentbuddy.com/Inventor/Parkyn-Jr- William-A/7198199;jsessionid=38309E4C02F63C74F03CB97826A4AF50 His personal interests were also varied and included world history, astrophysics, economics, cell biology, political philosophy or philosophy of the mind and Vikings and their written language or runes.

It was developed from the Mercedes-Benz W02 first seen in 1926, and the W11 shared its chassis and bodywork with the W02, but the W11 came with a larger more powerful engine, a new name and a wider list of ‚Äústandard bodies‚Äù from which customers could choose.Oswald, pp 217 & 219 The new car was also sold as the Mercedes-Benz 10/50 PS and as the Mercedes-Benz Typ Stuttgart 260. It continue in production till early 1934, although by then its replacements, the slightly smaller Mercedes-Benz W21 and the slightly larger Mercedes-Benz W18 had both already been in full-scale production for nearly a year.Oswald, pp 217 & 219 A light van based on the Mercedes-Benz W11 was also offered, and carried its own works number, being identified as the Mercedes-Benz W37  Naming conventions  The manufacturer applied the widely followed German naming conventions of the time. On the Mercedes-Benz 10/50 PS the ‚Äú10‚Äù defined the car‚Äôs tax horsepower, used by the authorities to determine the level of annual car tax to be imposed on car owners. The ‚Äú38‚Äù defined the manufacturer‚Äôs claims regarding car‚Äôs actual power output as defined in Horsepower#Metric horsepower (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks, ch). In Germany tax horsepower, which had been defined by statute since 1906, was based on the dimensions of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the cylinder stroke, and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower. Reflecting the manufacturer‚Äôs new naming strategy, the car was also sold as the Mercedes-Benz Typ Stuttgart, the Mercedes-Benz Typ 260 and as the Mercedes-Benz Typ Stuttgart 260 In retrospect sources tend to use the internal works number whereby the car was identified as the Mercedes-Benz W11. This reduces the risk of confusion with other cars from the same manufacturer incorporating the name ‚ÄúStuttgart‚Äù and / or the number ‚Äú260‚Äù in their names.  10/50 PS Typ Stuttgart 260 (W 11)  The car was offered in bare chassis form for customers wishing to purchase a car body from an independent coach builder. Standard bodies from the manufacturer started with a Torpedo-bodied ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù and included 2 or 4-door ‚ÄùLimousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon) bodies. There was also a choice from (initially) three different Mercedes-Benz cabriolet bodies, carrying according to the number of seats and of side windows, and listed respectively as the ‚ÄúCabriolet A‚Äù, the ‚ÄúCabriolet C‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCabriolet D‚Äù.Oswald, p 219 In 1933 the manufacturer also produced a Mercedes-Benz W11L with its wheelbase lengthened by to . Intended to accommodate longer six- seater Pullman-bodied cars. There is no record of Mercedes-Benz having offered from their own Sindelfingen coachworks a Pullman body for this vehicle, so customers would have needed to follow the old tradition of arranging bodywork separately with an independent coachbuilder. Only 50 of the long-wheelbase cars were producedOswald, p 206 but the development provided a useful precedent for the long-wheelbase version of the newer Mercedes-Benz W21 which proved a winner with taxi operators and of which more than 6,000 examples would be produced between 1934 and 1936. The side-valve six-cylinder 2,581 cc engine delivered a maximum output of at 3,400 rpm which translated into a top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph). Power was transmitted to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission, the fourth speed being effectively an overdrive ratio of 1 : 0.76 while the more conventional ‚Äútop‚Äù 1 : 1 ratio was achieved by selecting third gear. The wheels were fixed to a rigid axle suspended from semi-elliptic leaf springs. The braking applied to all four wheels, mechanically controlled using rod linkages.Oswald, p 219  L 1000 Express (W 37)  From 1929 the manufacturer also offered the commercially targeted Mercedes-Benz L 1000 Express which shared the technical elements of the Mercedes-Benz W11 and was known by its internal works number as the W37. Known versions include a flatbed truck, a box van (illustrated), an ambulance and a small ten seater bus. Between 1929 and 1932 the \\"10/50 PS / Typ Stuttgart 260\\" and the less powerful but broadly similar ‚ÄúTyp Stuttgart 200‚Äù were the mainstays of the Mercedes-Benz range. The period was a particularly difficult one for the German auto-industry with passenger car sales badly depressed. The 5,640 cars produced in 1929 represented 66% of the manufacturer's output.Oswald, pp 206 ‚Äì 209: Note that in some editions the totals at the foot of Page 208 are misaligned, apparently due to the omission of totals for 1926. Otherwise there is no plausible explanation for the mismatch between five column headings at the top of Page 208 and the four column totals at its foot. Corresponding figures (excluding van and military versions ) for the next three years are: ::1930: 4,453 cars / 69%, ::1931: 2,320 cars / 70%, ::1932: 885 cars / 15% (1932 saw the launch of the all-new and smaller W15 model. ) Production of the 2,581 cc Mercedes Benz Typ 260 / W11 ended with a trickle in 1934, by which time 6,807 had been produced. (If the volumes are combined with those for the less powerful W02 the total comfortably exceeds 20,000.) The replacement W21 model was introduced in 1933, by which year the auto-industry faced a much less bleak immediate-term outlook. Not included with these passenger car statistics are 1,507 \\"K√ºbelwagen\\" (military quasi-Jeep) versions of the model which continued to be produced until 1935Oswald, pp 206 & 207 or 1936.

R. Rahman. The single was released under Sony Music on 20 December 2012 and was recorded to \\"instill faith and optimism in people\\" prior to the predicted doomsday on 21 December 2012. The song was also released in Hindi, titled \\"Behad Pyaar\\", which translates to \\"Infinite Love\\" in English. Rahman, Indian rapper Blaaze along with Gil Levy wrote the lyrics for the English version, whereas lyricist Irshad Kamil worked on the Hindi lyrics. Development Initially, several reports in September 2012 came up that Rahman's son A. R. Ameen would feature in his maiden production venture which would be a film. Though Rahman confirmed the reports not to be a film but claimed kids to be a part of this project and so his son. In December 2012, Rahman announced that he has finished composing a song to \\"instill faith and optimism in people\\" facing a prediction that the world would come to an end on 21 December 2012. After his last non-film work of patriotic album Vande Mataram released in 1997, post 15 years Rahman came up with this single. For this project, he collaborated with global industrialist Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani's production Reliance Industries Ltd.. Rahman stated that he personally interacted with his fans and tapped into their perspectives on topics such as creating a borderless world, understanding of karma and the importance of being human. Infinite Love had developed keeping a global audience in mind. The base concept of the song evolved when Rahman recollected a story about an elephant, wandering into a village of the blind people. Each person touches a different part of the elephant, the trunk, the tail, the tusk, and each one feels what the creature is. Rahman said in one of his interviews that he had started working on the concept two years back in 2010 but due to his busy schedule, he could pay attention to it only after a year. He also wanted to make project kid-friendly which would provide kids \\"exciting content to watch\\". Music video A music video is directed by Paul Boyd who has worked with artists like Sting, Shania Twain, Kylie Minogue, Celine Dion, Bryan Adams and INXS. The video is choreographed by Longinus Fernandes, whose work in the 2012 Bollywood film Barfi! was lauded by critics. The video was shot in late- September 2012 at various locations including Mumbai, United States, Jamaica and Hong Kong. The video footage was shot across four different countries in 20 days over six months by Boyd, featuring children from Africa, Hong Kong, USA and India. A cloaked figure was also featured which would be indicated to bring healing to the world. Rahman wrote that the music video would serve \\"as a reminder\\" for everybody \\"to be open to change and the incredible ways we can come together in the world.\\" Rahman's son A. R. Ameen who made acting debut with \\"Infinite Love\\", had taken three days acting course before the shooting commenced. The music video involved around 200 people and had CGI effects which were finished in three months. The shooting footage of 30 hours was then edited to seven minutes short film to highlighted the making of video. Release The song was unveiled on 20 December 2012 at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Mumbai. The song was officially released on the same day through YouTube and iTunes. According to Rahman, writing in the Huffington Post, he was \\"excited to share\\" his new single video which would celebrate \\"the similarities and differences\\" of \\"all the great facets of life and culture around the world\\". Rahman wanted the song released like an album as he was involved in multiple roles for his project. In addition to creating the concept for the project, Rahman also acted as a producer, and he described the whole project as a \\"learning process\\" for him. He expressed to extend the concept to an extended play, \\"if not a complete album\\". References Category:2012 singles Category:Indian songs Category:Music videos Category:Songs with music by A. R.

They left her bound and gagged, which caused her to suffocate. The two were almost sentenced to death by the court, but were given a stay of execution and sentenced to prison instead. After the incident Morgan's Corner gained a reputation for being haunted. Morgan's Corner Morgan's Corner is a bend on Nuuanu Pali Drive that connected Honolulu to KƒÅne ªohe before it was superseded by Hawaii Route 61. The bend is after a hairpin turn from the Honolulu side of the bend. Morgan's Corner became referred to as a \\"corner\\" because the bend curves the road perpendicularly so that from Honolulu one enters the bend from the north and exits to the east or from KƒÅne ªohe one enters the bend from the east and exits to the north. The namesake came from Dr. James Morgan, who built his villa on the inside of the bend in the 1920s. Wilder's house was opposite Morgan's, south of the bend. The Murder At the time of the murder the area was a semirural rainforest. Petty criminals James Majors (19) and John Palakiko (21) escaped a prison work crew on March 10, 1948. The next day they intended to get supplies by burglarizing a neighbor of Therese Wilder (68), widow of William Wilder. The pair were hungry and when they smelled Wilder's cooking they decided to rob her instead. The two men attacked, bound, and gagged Wilder, then left her on her bed. During the struggle Wilder had her jaw broken. She suffocated when she was gagged with a broken jaw. Five days later on March 16 Wilder's gardener Isabelo Escalante and maid Miya Matayoshi found her body. Outcomes The Honolulu Board of Supervisors offered a reward for the capture of those responsible for the murder. A few days after the murder, Majors and Palakiko were apprehended. On April 16 they were charged with first-degree murder in the court of Judge Carrick Buck. Majors pleaded not guilty and Palakiko requested to postpone his plea. On June 18 the jury found the men guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced them to death by hanging. Some Native Hawaiians, local Chinese, and Japanese thought that their sentence showed a double standard in Hawaiian society. In the Massie Case Grace Fortescue, a white woman, had only served an hour-long sentence for the premeditated murder of a Hawaiian man, while Majors and Palakiko did not intend to kill Wilder and were sentenced to death. On September 13, 1951, Governor Oren Long issued a stay of execution two minutes before the execution when attorney Harriet Bouslog presented evidence the men gave forced confessions. In 1954 Governor Samuel King commuted the men's sentences from death to 90 years in prison. On December 21, 1962 Governor John Burns commuted the men's sentences to probation. Palakiko violated parole and was sent to prison for three years where he died on September 11, 1974. Majors completed parole on December 20, 1968. After the murder, Morgan's Corner gained a reputation for being haunted. Stories about the road are often variations on the urban legend known as \\"The Hook\\".

Background and education Mountaineers in the Tasman Valley of New Zealand (from left): Matthias Zurbriggen, Fizgerald, Arthur Ollivier, George Edward Mannering and Jack Adamson FitzGerald was born in 1871 at Litchfield, Connecticut, and was the third son of William John FitzGerald, barrister, a British subject, and Mary, daughter of Eli White, of New York. He was educated at St Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1890 but did not graduate. His elder brother was Augustine (called Austin), a painter, and his elder sister was Caroline, a poet. Mountaineering He joined the Himalayan explorer Martin Conway for a walk across the Alps in 1894, where he met the Swiss guide Matthias Zurbriggen. Sufficiently impressed, FitzGerald decided to hire Zurbriggen as his guide for the next five years. In 1894/95 FitzGerald travelled to New Zealand, intending to make the first ascent of Mount Cook, but local climbers, alarmed their highest mountain might first be climbed by foreigners, climbed it a few days after FitzGerald's arrival. He and Zurbriggen made the first ascent of Mount Sefton, and with the New Zealander Jack Clarke (who had made the first ascent of Mount Cook), made first ascents of Mount Sealy, Mount Silberhorn, Mount Tasman and Mount Haidinger.FitzGerald, Edward. Climbs in the New Zealand Alps. T Fisher Unwin, 1896 Aconcagua expedition In 1896/97 FitzGerald personally financed and led a large expedition to South America to complete scientific surveys and make first ascents of some of the highest peaks in the Andes. The expedition included a geologist, surveyor, engineer, and naturalist, and six alpine guides led by Zurbriggen. After reconnoitering the Vacas valley approach to Aconcagua, FitzGerald made a base camp at around in the Horcones Valley, where several attempts were made to reach the summit via what is now known as the Normal Route.Secor, R.J. Aconcagua: a climbing guide. The Mountaineers Books, 1999 Five attempts were made over six weeks before Zurbriggen reached the summit alone on 14 January 1897. FitzGerald had been with Zurbriggen during the ascent, but on all attempts became nauseous at around . Eventually, fearing he would never reach the summit and the first ascent of Aconcagua would not be made, he sent Zurbriggen on alone. A period of heavy snow followed Zurbriggen's ascent, during which no further attempts could be made, but FitzGerald continued the siege a month later. Again he became ill during the ascent, but on 13 February 1897, the Englishman Stuart Vines and Italian guide Nicola Lanti also reached the summit.

The book centers on a time-traveling Depression-era drifter who must murder the \\"shining girls\\" in order to continue his travels. The Shining Girls was published on 15 April 2013 by the Umuzi imprint of Random House Struik in South Africa, on 25 April 2013 by HarperCollins in the United Kingdom, and on 4 June 2013 by Mulholland Books in the United States. HarperCollins had won the international rights to the book in a bidding war with several other publishers. Unlike her previous novels, which are set in South Africa, The Shining Girls takes place in Chicago. Beukes said that because the story steps back and forth through history, she felt South Africa would not be a suitable setting because \\"then it would become an Apartheid story\\". Beukes added that race issues appear frequently in her work, but \\"Apartheid would have overwhelmed everything else I wanted to do with the novel\\". In August 2013, The Shining Girls was short-listed for UK based Crime Writers' Association 2013 Goldsboro Gold Dagger award. Plot In Depression-era Chicago, a drifter named Harper Curtis finds a key to a house that opens on to other times. But it comes at a cost. He has to kill the shining girls: bright young women who burn with potential. He stalks them through their lives across different eras until, in 1989, one of his victims, Kirby Mazrachi, survives and starts hunting him back. Criticism and reviews The Shining Girls received positive to mixed reviews from critics. Writing for NPR, American writer and critic Alan Cheuse called The Shining Girls \\"a triumph\\" and \\"a marvelous narrative feat that spans the history of Chicago from the 1930s to the 1990s\\". He complimented Beukes on her in-depth research into Chicago's history, and described the plot as a \\"well-made, though extremely complex temporal creation\\". A reviewer in the National Post described The Shining Girls as \\"a thoroughly satisfying thriller\\" and said that Kirby's charm is \\"irresistible and irrepressible\\", while Harper reminds one of the 1890s Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. American writer Julia Keller wrote in a review of the book in the Chicago Tribune that she was pleased that The Shining Girls deviates from traditional serial-killer fiction in that it does not glorify the killer. Beukes presents Harper as \\"greedy and seedy and opportunistic\\", rather than \\"scintillatingly brilliant and alluringly damaged\\". While the book's time-travel theme \\"stretches scientific plausibility\\", Keller said that the book's strength comes from Beukes's \\"audacious imaginative vision\\", and that she has made \\"delicate and redemptive magic\\" out of \\"something horrific and inexplicable\\". Simmy Richman wrote in The Independent that while the book has good ideas, it is \\"ultimately another high-concept novel that suffers in the execution\\". He said that the back-and- forth time travel results in the story \\"feel[ing] all over the place\\". Richman added that Beukes's characterization of Harper's victims was good, but felt that she does not give the killer the same attention. American author Charles Finch writing in a review in USA Today also felt that The Shining Girls is \\"not entirely successful in its execution\\", but added that because Beukes is \\"so profusely talented ‚Äì capable of wit, darkness, and emotion on a single page\\", the book should still be a \\"blockbuster\\". Finch said that while Beukes \\"successfully defines and limits her story's magical elements\\", the magic \\"come[s] apart at the seams\\" during the final showdown between Kirby and Harper. In a review in The New York Times, American journalist and critic Janet Maslin wrote that Beukes has made The Shining Girls more than \\"a standard serial-killer story\\" by \\"load[ing] it with acrobatic twists\\", and said it is a \\"strong contender for the role of this summer's universal beach read\\". Maslin added that a strong point of the book is \\"the emotional effect of the victims' unusual virtue\\" that Beukes creates, but complained about the book's lack of information about Harper. Maslin also criticized the fact that all the story's \\"occult power\\" rests in the House, which \\"has a mind of its own, but we never find out how it works\\". Alison Flood wrote in a review in The Guardian that if you accept Beukes's \\"time-travel conceit\\", The Shining Girls is a page-turner that will \\"take some beating this summer\\". Flood defended Beukes's decision not to explain how the House works, saying that \\"The [H]ouse just is\\", and that Harper's underdeveloped character is what makes him an enigma. She complimented Beukes on her victims, calling them \\"vivid, glowing characters\\", and described Kirby as \\"one of the sarkiest, most resilient heroines you're likely to meet this year\\". Adaptations In May 2013 it was announced that MRC and Appian Way, Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, have bought the television rights to The Shining Girls. In July 2020, Apple announced it would greenlight a straight-to-series order for \\"Shining Girls,\\" launching exclusively on Apple TV+.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on December 11, 2012. The episode is written by Steven D. Binder and directed by Arvin Brown, and was seen by 17.65 million viewers. Diane, the ex-wife of Gibbs and Fornell, returns in the middle of an NCIS investigation. Plot FBI Agent Tobias Fornell is attacked by a gunman at a drive-thru, but is protected by a bulletproof vest and manages to return fire and kill the shooter. Since the shooter is identified as a Navy Seaman, Gibbs and the NCIS team are called in to investigate. The sailor, Tyler Brown, had Fornell's car license number written on a matchbook, indicating that he was deliberately targeted. The matchbook leads Gibbs and Fornell to a bar where Tyler moonlighted as a bouncer. While they are questioning the bartender, their mutual ex-wife, Diane Sterling, emerges from the bathroom. She claims to be conducting an audit for the I.R.S., but the bartender speaks up, saying she had expressed interest in buying the bar. Gibbs and Fornell arrest her on a charge of lying to federal agents, but Director Vance steps in and informs them that Diane is now a Special Agent for the I.R.S.'s Criminal Investigation Division, and she was on an undercover assignment at the bar, investigating a massive tax fraud case - someone has been stealing hundreds of identities, submitting false tax returns in their names and collecting millions in illicit refunds. She was using her old I.D. from her marriage to Fornell (because of \\"budget cuts\\") and sheepishly admits that was probably why Brown was ordered to kill him. Vance then informs Gibbs, Fornell and Diane that they have been ordered to work on the case together - to their shared horror. The team guesses that Seaman Brown was responsible for stealing the identities of patrons at the bar, and acted as hired muscle, but someone else is the mastermind. Their first suspect is an accountant named Oliver Lambert. When they raid his house they find a number of freezers, one of which contains the body of another patron of the bar. After Lambert himself (who was helping smuggle the fake IDs to Asia inside fish shipments) turns up, only to end up dying from stab wounds, they realize the real killer is Gordon Freemont, one of Lambert's clients. Freemont was actually running a smuggling operation. They catch up to him at a wedding reception, where he tries to kidnap Diane, which Gibbs averts by delivering a fake proposal to his ex-wife. A subplot of the episode is the way Diane interacts with the team. She tells Ziva she is taking a break from her husband, Victor Sterling, but lets slip to McGee that Victor is leaving her. She and McGee also fall asleep while talking, so rumors circulate that they slept together, infuriating Fornell and amusing DiNozzo. Fornell also tells Gibbs that Diane specifically requested transfer to his jurisdiction. Diane visits Gibbs in private and thanks him for saving her life. They both refer to their last private conversation, during the events of \\"Devil's Triangle\\", when she said that Gibbs never loved any woman except his first wife, Shannon, but Diane loved him just as much. She now admits that she might have been wrong to say Gibbs never loved her at all. Gibbs advises her to forgive Victor for being himself and not someone else; their marriage failed because he couldn't let go of his attachment to Shannon, and hers will fail if she doesn't let go of her attachment to him, \\"and the last thing you want to be is me.\\" Diane agrees to consider this advice, and asks Gibbs how he feels about living his life alone. He replies, \\"I‚Äôm not alone.\\" Production \\"Devil's Trifecta\\" is written by Steven D. Binder and directed by Arvin Brown. The episode marks the return of Gibbs' ex-wife Diane Sterling (Melinda McGraw), first seen in the season nine episode \\"Devil's Triangle\\". On October 16, 2012, TV Line reported the return of both Diane Sterling and Tobias Fornell (Joe Spano), where Sterling \\"has to work undercover\\" with Gibbs and Fornell\\". In Diane's first episode, she comes to Gibbs and Fornell for help in finding her missing husband, but in this episode the writer wanted to \\"put her on more even footing - to even make her an equal, if possible. [...] The thought of her throwing a badge in Fornell‚Äôs face was too good to pass up.\\" Reception \\"Devil's Trifecta\\" was seen by 17.65 million live viewers following its broadcast on December 11, 2012, with a 2.8/8 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Devil's Trifecta\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. The spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 15.12 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"Gone\\", \\"Devil's Trifecta\\" was down in both viewers and adults 18-49. Mary Powers from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.7 (out of 5) and stated that \\"If there is an episode that features Gibbs and Fornell, you can almost guarantee it to be a hoot-feast, and tonight's episode was no exception. As serious as the episode began with Fornell almost being killed, it quickly turned into one laugh right after another when the center of the entire mess turns out to be Gibbs and Fornell's mutual ex-wife, Diane Sterling (Melinda McGraw).\\" References Category:2012 American television episodes Category:NCIS (season 10) episodes ","title":"Devil's Trifecta"},{"id":"37983054","text":"Julian Charles Porteous (born 5 June 1949) is the Catholic Archbishop of Hobart, Tasmania.

The Park was established in 1990. It covers an area of . Botswana borders it to the west and is surrounded by communal area conservancies. The Kwando River forms the western border with Botswana. Various communal area conservancies and community forests surround Mudumu National Park. The area is an important migration route from Botswana to Angola for large game species such as African elephant. There is no boundary fence, and Mudumu forms a crucial trans- boundary link for wildlife migration between Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia. It is in the centre of Africa‚Äôs largest conservation area, the Kavango-Zambezi Trans-Frontier Conservation Area (KaZa TFCA).  History  Mudumu National Park was created in 1990, shortly before Namibia's independence. Although the approved size of the park is , the actual size is .  Climate  Average annual rainfall is between and per year, with the peak rainy period arriving in January and February. In years of heavy rainfall, flooding can be extensive, although Mudumu is drier than her sister park, Nkasa Rupara.  Geography and access  thumbnail The Park is situated approximately south of Kongola, bordered by Botswana to the west, and various communal area conservancies. The entire park is flat, with no hills or mountains. A fossilized river course - the Mudumu Mulapo ‚Äì lies in the centre of the park. This is a seasonally dry, open channel that drains the primarily Mopane woodlands of the hinterland to the east. There is no formal entrance gate and the park is unfenced. A graded track, called a cutline, separates the park from neighbouring communal farmland. C49 (D3511) road runs through the park linking the villages of Kongola and Sangwali.  Biology and ecology  Mudumu National Park is situated in the tree and shrub savannah biome. Vegetation types are north-eastern Kalahari woodlands, riverine woodlands and islands, Caprivi mopane woodland and Caprivi floodplains. The Kwando River floodplain, grasslands, riparian woodlands and dense mopane woodland shelter woodland fauna and flora.  Flora  Mopane (Colophospermum mopane), wild syringa (Burkea africana), leadwood (Combretum imberbe) and mangosteen (Garcinia livingstonii) are common trees.  Fauna  Mudumu has a large African elephant population. Other animals include Cape buffalo, lion, leopard, spotted hyena, cheetah, Cape wild dog, hippopotamus, crocodile, sitatunga, meerkats, red lechwe, sable antelope, eland, giraffe, common impala, Burchell‚Äôs zebra, wildebeest and spotted-necked otter. There are no black or white rhinos in this park. Sable antelope, giraffe and eland were re- introduced into the area. Tiger fish and tilapia are common fish species. 430 bird species have been recorded, including African fish eagle, African skimmer and western-banded snake eagle. Fire  Natural fires caused by lightning and human-made fires burn large sections of the park each year. Firebreaks are made during the wet summer months. An early burning programme has been introduced in the dry winter months from May‚ÄìJuly.  Recreation  Walking, bird watching and game viewing are the main tourism activities. The Namibian Government has divided the park into various areas, called concessions. These create zones for various activities. Two privately managed lodges are in the park. No permits are needed for travelling on the C49 road that connects the villages of Kongola and Lizauli. Permits are required on all other roads and tracks within the park. Most roads require four-wheel drive vehicles. During the rainy season from November to April it is recommended to drive in a convoy of at least two vehicles. Mudumu is located within a high-risk malaria area.  Kavango-Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area  Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe have agreed to manage trans-boundary conservation through the Kavango‚ÄìZambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area (KaZa TFCA). Mudumu is situated in the centre of the Kaza TFCA and forms a corridor for elephant, buffalo, roan and sable antelope movement from Botswana into Angola and Zambia. KaZa includes numerous proclaimed national parks (including Mudumu), game reserves, community conservation areas, forest reserves, and iconic tourism destinations such as the Victoria Falls and Okavango Delta. KaZa aims to broaden the protected areas network, increase biodiversity, expand historical game migration routes and attract tourists to the area. In a place where local people often bear the costs of living with wildlife, KaZa aims to make the protection of wildlife and wild places economically more attractive to rural communities.  Park Management  Mudumu National Park is one of five national parks in north-eastern Namibia. It is managed as a unit with Bwabwata National Park, Khaudom National Park, Mangetti National Park and Nkasa Lupala (formerly Mamili National Park). Since 2006, the NamParks Project (formerly BMM Parks Project), co-funded by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW, has helped develop these parks. Funding has been used to set up tourism, business and management plans, improve infrastructure, translocate animals back into their natural habitat and develop partnerships between Government and communities to manage parks with other land units. Mudumu National Park forms part of the Mudumu North and Mudumu South complexes. Complexes group formally protected areas, conservancies and forestry management areas into single units to manage resources across park and conservancy boundaries. Stakeholders work together on law enforcement and anti-poaching, fire management (early burning), game monitoring and wildlife translocations. This approach is known as integrated park management.  Park development  The Ngenda Ranger Station is the park headquarters. Staff offices, entrance gates and housing were built as part of the cooperation. NamParks has helped introduce park-friendly land-uses in the surrounding areas and collaborative management structures. Mudumu serves as a core wildlife area, supplying wildlife to neighbouring conservancies that can encourage tourists. Trophy-hunting is practiced in the park under strict conditions.

It is one of the oldest of the London dining clubs and frequently meets in Lambeth Palace. Its motto is Pro Ecclesia et Rege. History The club, often referred to simply as Nobody's Friends or Nobody's, was founded in honour of William Stevens and first met on 21 June 1800 at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand. Its inaugural dinner consisted of thirteen men who would later form the movement known as the Hackney Phalanx. In the late 1880s Nobody‚Äôs occasionally met at the Freemasons' Tavern, which served as a meeting place for a variety of notable organisations from the eighteenth century until it was demolished to make way for the Connaught Hotel in 1909. 1891 menuStevens was a wealthy hosier who became a writer and philanthropist, leading figure in the High Church movement, and Treasurer of Queen Anne's Bounty. He wrote theological pamphlets under the nom de plume of Nobody which gave the club its curious name. The club grew to consist of 50 members, half clergymen and half laymen, and met three times a year. Between 1800 and 1900 membership included three archbishops, forty-nine bishops, twenty Cathedral deans, many peers and baronets, and members of the House of Commons. It also included privy councillors, judges, and fellows of both the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. A Nobody's menu from 1891 shows a club dinner at the Hotel Metropole, London consisting of ten or more courses, standard at that time in formal Victorian dining. It may be assumed that presentation of the courses was in the service √† la russe tradition. Recent times It is recorded that in 1962. a former bishop of Norwich, Launcelot Fleming, left Nobody's the \\"worse for wear\\" and was later found by friends singing \\"I‚Äôm a space Bishop\\" whilst wearing a motorbike helmet he had acquired on the journey home. The story may be apocryphal, but it is said that he met his future wife among the friends who discovered him in this state. Writing in his diaries The Old Boys' Network, John Rae the celebrated headmaster of Westminster School said of a 1984 dinner: It is believed that women have since been admitted as members, but this is not known for definite. In 2005, Conservative peer Lord Brooke speaking in the House of Lords on the death of Lord Belstead said In 2014, the retired bishop of Bath and Wells, Rt Revd John Bickersteth, when asked how he had become a bishop described how after being 'spotted' at Nobody's, \\"You used to have lunch at the Athenaeum.\\" Though he recalled that in his case, the luncheon leading to episcopal elevation took place at The Commonwealth Club. The current President of Nobody's is believed to be Sir Philip Mawer, former Secretary General of the Church of England's Synod and current chair of Allchurches Trust. He was President in 2015. It is not known whether he has been replaced. IICSA In 2018 the club was subject of a question in the IICSA hearing into abuse in the Church of England. Lord Lloyd had sent a letter of influence in the Peter Ball case to Archbishop Carey prefaced with the phrase \\"May I presume on a brief acquaintanceship at dinners of Nobody's Friends?\\" When asked about the club in his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Lloyd described Nobody's Friends as \\"simply a club, half consisting of the clergy, members of the clergy, and half consisting of members of the laity, which dine together probably twice a year, very often in Lambeth Palace.\\" The IICSA counsel pointed out that the Daily Mail had once described it as \\"centred on a strong core of bishops, ex-Tory ministers and former military top brass, a highly secretive, all-male group representing Britain's most entrenched professions and institutions.\\" Lord Lloyd replied, \\"That's a typical Daily Mail description of something they don't particularly like, but I can assure you that Nobody's Friends is a perfectly ordinary dining club...\\" The same article that IICSA drew upon in the hearing indicated that Prime Minister Tony Blair had been keen to join the club in 2003. Stephen Parsons commented in an influential blog, following the IICSA hearing, that the forum Nobody‚Äôs Friends provided for influence in the Peter Ball case suggested a ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù in the Church of England.

Early life Josef Auchentaller attended the Technical College in Vienna from 1882‚Äì1886. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna starting in 1890, and there he excelled and won several awards. In 1885, he fell in love with Emma Scheid, the daughter of a prosperous manufacturer of silverware and jewelry. The couple married in 1891 after her father was convinced of Auchentaller's social and financial suitability. They had a daughter, Maria Josepha, and a son, Peter. Career Beginning in 1895, he contributed art nouveau designs for his father-in-law's company, G.A. Scheid. From 1892‚Äì1896, the Auchentallers lived in Munich, where he studied under Paul Hoecker, a founder of the 1892 Munich Secession. Auchentaller contributed to Jugend, the German Secession review established in 1896. Vienna Secession In 1897, the Vienna Secession was formed by artists who had left the Association of Austrian Artists. The Auchentallers returned from a vacation in Italy to take part. Between 1898‚Äì1904, Auchentaller showed his work in 10 Secessionist shows. Auchentaller designed the poster and the catalog covers for the Seventh (1900) and Fourteenth (1902) exhibitions. He also played a role in the Secession's organizing committee from the Fifth to the Tenth Exhibition (1899‚Äì1901). In 1905, he left the Secession along with Gustav Klimt due to differences of artistic opinion. Auchentaller was a contributor to the magazine Ver Sacrum, a Secessionist publication, and sat on its editorial board between 1900‚Äì1901. For this magazine, he contributed two title pages and many graphics. His work consisted primarily of floral motifs and linear drawings influenced by Japanese woodcuts which were the popular during that time (see Japonisme). The eighth issue of Ver Sacrum was entirely devoted to Auchentaller. His family connections to the Scheids and Thonets continued to provide him with further work. For Georg Adam Scheid's company, G.A.S. Silver Jewelry Manufacturers, the artist designed jewelry heavily influenced by the Art Nouveau and Jugendstil movements. Auchentaller also produced numerous billboards and posters for companies including Aureol (1898), Schott and Donnath, Kath Reiners Kneipp barley (1899), Continental pneumatic (1900), International Fisheries Exhibition, and G.A.S. Silver Jewelry Manufacturers (1902). Grado, Italy Pension Fortino in Grado, 2009 Advertisement poster Seebad Grado In 1903, he moved with his wife and children to Grado, Italy, seeking a better climate and financial stability. From 1904, the Auchentallers spent every summer in Grado, where they contributed significantly to the growth of tourism in the Adriatic seaside resort town. He provided ornamentation for a new pensione, the \\"Pension Fortino,\\" designed by the architect Julius Mayreder. His wife, Emma, later installed a steam laundry and bought an island where fruit and vegetables were grown for the town. Grado soon became a popular holiday destination of the Viennese bourgeoisie and for Auchentaller's circle of artist friends, including Carl Moll, Alfred Roller, Wilhelm List, Max Kurzweil, and the architect Otto Wagner. In 1906, Auchenteller designed the advertisement poster Seebad Grado, which endures as one of his most famous art nouveau works. Although he spent winters in Vienna, Auchentaller became increasingly isolated from the Austrian art world after leaving the Secession in 1905. Increasingly, he began to paint moody landscapes and portraits. His family life became strained: his daughter, Maria Josepha, committed suicide in 1914, and there were rumors that his wife was involved with another man in Grado. In 1914, war was declared and the Auchentellers moved back to Austria. In 1919, the Auchentallers took Italian citizenship and moved to Grado for good. Emma died in 1945, and Auchentaller died four years later in 1949. Legacy Bunte B√§nder (Portrait of Maria) (oil on canvas, 120 cm √ó 110.5 cm), 1912, Archivio Auchentaller, Italy. Auchentaller was a substantial contributor to the Vienna Secession and the Art Nouveau style. However, many of Auchentaller's works remain in private collections or were lost. In 1920s, a sizeable collection of his oil paintings bound for a retrospective in Argentina disappeared. A large frieze he painted entitled \\"Joy, Fair Spark of the Gods\\", created for the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna, is lost as well. In 2008‚Äì2009, a traveling exhibition entitled \\"Josef Maria Auchentaller (1865-1949): A Secessionist on the Borders of the Empire\\" was curated by Roberto Festi. Over 300 of his works were displayed at the Palazzo Attems-Petzenstein, in the Musei provinciali of Gorizia, Italy; the Galleria Civica in Bolzano, Italy; and the Leopold Museum in Vienna, Austria. In 2013 two portraits of his daughter Maria, including Bunte B√§nder ('colourful ribbons'), were shown at the National Gallery, London exhibition Facing the Modern: The Portrait in Vienna 1900.

Overview  T-122 Rocket Pods on Display As part of the modernization drive undertaken by the Turkish Military in the 1980s and 90's several new rocket systems were developed for the needs of the Turkish army. Prototypes of the system were revealed in 1995 with the first vehicles undertaking trials and evaluation in 1996. Production commenced in 1997. The system consists of two pods of 122-mm launch tubes which are hydraulically traversed and elevated. It is equipped with a state-of-the-art fire control system which calculates firing data automatically for rockets with different warheads and is capable of storing up to 20 target coordinates. The vehicle can fire rockets singly or in salvo, with a full forty rocket launch taking less than 80 seconds and blanketing a target area of 500 m √ó 500 m. In addition the later versions of the T-122 features an integral hydraulic crane which allows reloading of rockets pods within five minutes. The rockets for the system were developed and manufactured by MKEK and ROKETSAN, though the T-122 can fire 122mm rockets from the BM-21 and associated systems. Indigenous rockets are available with HE-FRAG or cluster warheads which can contain either anti-personnel or anti-tank submunitions. Maximum range of fire with extended-range rockets is up to 40 km. Variants *TR-122 *TRB-122 *TRG-122 First production models of the T-122 Sakarya launcher vehicle were based on the German MAN 26.281 heavy utility truck. An improved variant of the system was revealed in 2005 which is based on the MAN 26.372 truck which is also used as the launcher vehicle for the J-600T Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m short-range ballistic missile. The improved system is fitted to use factory-sealed disposable rocket pods that are specifically designed to be maintenance free, resistant to handling and environmental conditions and allow rapid reloading.

Over the course of more than fifty years, Langs developed a revised version of psychoanalytic psychotherapy, currently known as the ‚Äúadaptive paradigm‚Äù.Langs 2004a; Langs 2004b; Freud 2010 This is a distinctive model of the mind, and particularly of the mind‚Äôs unconscious component, significantly different from other forms of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy.  Overview  Langs treated psychoanalysis as a biological science, subject to the laws of evolution and adaptation.Langs 1996 As with any living species, coping with environmental threats‚Äîand the resultant stresses and psychological traumas‚Äì must lie at the heart of human life including human psychological life. Langs‚Äô research led him to posit the existence of a mental module he termed the ‚Äúemotion- processing mind,‚Äù a psychic function which evolved to ensure the survival of the species. Langs contended that it had done so at the cost of adaptive failures and with devastating emotional consequences. He maintained that he had identified the assets and limitations of the emotion processing mind clinically and shown how the insights from this approach can help correct adaptive deficits, allowing more fulfilling lives, both individually and collectively.Langs 1996; Langs 2004a Langs therefore rejects the prevailing belief among psychoanalytic traditions that sexual or aggressive wishes and fantasies, the need for sound relationships with and affirmations from others, or self-actualization are the main issues in emotional life (see psychoanalysis). For Langs, the latter may be significant in any given clinical situation but precisely to the extent that they raise issues associated with emotional adaptation. Langs revamped the psychoanalytic view of the unconscious mind, in accordance with his evolutionary approach. According to him, the unconscious mind operates on the basis of perceptions outside of awareness ‚Äì subliminal or unconscious perceptions ‚Äì much as the conscious mind operates on the basis of conscious perceptions, i.e. perceptions within awareness. The unconscious mind evolved, according to Langs, due to the development of language acquisition, which brought with it the uniquely human awareness of the future and, correspondingly, the sense of our own mortality and other death-related issues. This realization of mortality is often evoked by traumatic incidents and, thus, the anxiety- provoking ramifications of those experiences are barred from consciousness, though perceived unconsciously and then adaptively processed towards resolution. In contrast to classical psychoanalytic theory, which tends to view the unconscious mind as a chaotic mix of drives, needs, and wishes (see psychoanalysis), Langs sees the unconscious mind as an adaptive entity functioning outside of direct awareness. Because the conscious mind finds death-related traumas and stresses unbearable, it tends to deny the anxiety- provoking meaning of traumatic events but thereby also loses the potential wisdom that the traumatic experience might confer. According to Langs, the conscious mind thereby adapts, by surviving the event that seemed unbearable, but simultaneously fails to adapt, by leaving unconscious what it might have gained from the experience. Thus an important goal of adaptive therapy is to access the wisdom of the unconscious mind, which is denied at the conscious level due to the pain and anxiety associated with the traumatic event. According to Langs, the activities of unconscious processing reach the conscious mind solely through the encoded messages that are conveyed in narrative communications like dreams. He maintains that, as a rule, dreams are responses to current traumas and adaptive challenges and that their story lines characteristically convey two sets of meanings: the first expressed directly as the story qua story, while the second is expressed in code and implicitly, disguised in the story‚Äôs images. We can tap into our unconscious wisdom by properly decoding our dreams, i.e. by linking the dream to the traumas that have evoked them‚Äîa process Langs calls ‚Äútrigger decoding‚Äù. This process, according to Langs, is the essence of self-healing based on deep insight. Langs' work also expanded beyond individual therapy into social issues. For example, Langs‚Äô focus on how human beings cope with reality and traumas resulted in his identifying three forms of unconsciously experienced death anxiety and in his showing how each form can mark a universal or archetypal path to devastation, not only individually but collectively.Langs 2004a; Langs 2004b; Langs 2008; Langs 2010; White 2012 Langs‚Äô work also moved into questions of spirituality, in part because so much of religion deals with death-related phenomena.Langs 2008 Langs developed ways of recognizing what triggers death anxieties and also ways of neutralizing their destructive effects.Langs 2004a; Langs 2004b; Langs 2010 In summary, Langs' approach to psychotherapy is deeply rooted in the psychoanalytic tradition, but differs from mainstream psychoanalysis in significant ways: he (1) draws his approach from evolutionary biology and the principle of adaptation; (2) treats the unconscious according to adaptive principles; (3) roots psychic conflict fundamentally in death anxiety and death-related traumas.  Life and work  Langs was born in 1928 in Brooklyn, New York. His undergraduate education was at the University of Pennsylvania (1945‚Äì1948), and his graduate medical education at the Chicago Medical School. He worked in various internships and residencies at the US Public Service Hospital in Staten Island, The Albert Einstein College of Medicine, The Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, and The Research Center for Mental Health at New York University (1953‚Äì1965). His psychoanalytic training was at the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York, from 1959 to 1968, where he supervised with Jacob Arlow. Langs has held numerous professional and academic positions. He was also an Honorary Visiting Fellow at the School of Psychotherapy and Counselling, Regent‚Äôs College, London, England.Langs 2004a; Langs 2010 Langs has authored, co-authored or edited more than 175 scholarly articles and 47 books, ranging over many distinct genre. Among these genre are systematic psychoanalytic investigations, training texts, substantive transcripts from supervision sessions, popular books of applied psychoanalysis, plays, historical- analytical studies. His publications have been translated into the major Western European languages, as well as Russian and Japanese. Langs was also editor of the International Journal for Psycho-Analysis from 1972 to 1983. Dr. Langs wrote and lectured all over the world on dreams, emotions, unconscious communication, and the science of the mind. His last speaking engagement was at the Library of Congress. He was a visiting professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City and an honorary visiting fellow with the School of Psychotherapy and Counseling, Regents College, London. He is the founder of the \\"communicative-adaptive\\" school of psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy. \\"New Overview of Robert Langs' Communicative-Adaptive Model of Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy\\" Retrieved on 09 Jan 2018 Langs is best known for his rigorous emphasis on establishing and maintaining a secure frame for analysis, his development of the concept of the bi-personal field, and his extensive documentation of encoded transference derivatives in the analytic interaction. It is useful to divide Langs‚Äô publishing career into four more or less distinct phases, based on the central themes of interest in each, though themes from earlier phases tend to re-emerge in new ways in the later periods of Langs' career. Since there is a major shift between the second and third phases, discussion of reactions to Langs' work will come after the second phase and again after the fourth phases below. He and his wife had a house on Bell Place in Amagansett. He and Ms. Raphael were married in 1990. They had lived in Plainview and Roslyn.  First phase  In the first phase, from about 1968 through the mid-70's Langs worked with a classical psychoanalytic approach, focused on the transference and on the analysis of dreams, dreams being interpreted in terms of disguised wishes and fantasies.Langs 1973; Langs 1974 he was already concerned at this date with the distinction between intrapsychic fantasies and experiences of reality. This distinction, according to him, cuts across both conscious and unconscious realms, thus permitting a careful look at unconscious perceptions (as opposed to unconscious fantasies). Unconscious perceptions became crucial for Langs' psychoanalytic psychotherapy because, whereas most classical psychoanalytic notions of the unconscious mind suggest that unconscious contents are purely intrapsychic fantasies, Langs insisted that some unconscious experiences are unconscious perceptions of reality, a point with substantial implications for therapeutic practice. For example, if there are unconscious perceptions, one would expect the unconscious mind of a patient to communicate (among other things) the experience of erroneous interventions on the part of the therapist. In the latter case, the therapist could not assume that such experiences were mere fantasies on the part of the client. Rather, the therapist must assume that there could be some validity to the patient's unconscious perception and therefore that the patient may be perceiving the truth of the matter in experiencing therapist errors.Langs 1976; Langs 1977; Langs 1978 From early on, Langs analyzed this connection between psychic experience and reality in terms of \\"adaptation,\\" suggesting that psychic phenomena should be interpreted in terms of the goals of adaptation in the individual, an adaptive process which refers not only to the patient's life outside of the consulting room but also and especially to the patient's experiences within the consulting room. There are striking parallels here between Langs' and some of Carl Jung's earlier work, which also emphasized adaptation, though Langs appears to have come to this conclusion independently of any knowledge of Jung's ideas. Though some classical Jungian thinkers emphasize adaptation,Adler n.d. Langs appears to put adaptation more at the center of his work than either Jung or most Jungians.  Second phase  The focus on unconscious perception in the client led Langs to a focus on therapeutic technique, one of the salient characteristics of his second phase, extending from the mid-70s through the 80s. This phase is characterized by a number of supervision transcripts published in book form, where Langs develops a number of ideas that came to be essential to his approach.Langs 1976a; Langs 1976b; Langs 1976c; Langs 1977; Langs 1978; Langs 1978a; Langs 1979; Langs 1980 Langs' study of dreams led him to recognize analogies with his earlier clinical research, such that he could distinguish between two different kinds of dream interpretation: those interpretations which read dreams purely in terms of fantasy and thus in isolation from the patient's experience of reality versus those interpretations which read the dream as intimating something of the client's experience and adaptation to reality. Langs generalized this distinction to the therapeutic relationship, where he focused on what he termed the \\"adaptive context,\\" i.e. the motivating adaptive experiences which provoked or \\"triggered\\" certain types of dreams, fantasies, etc. Langs notes that this distinction allows for two different ways of interpreting a patient's experiences and communications: as products of purely intrapsychic fantasy or as products of a patient's attempt to adapt to (the experience of) reality. Clinically, Langs developed a complex and sophisticated understanding of so- called \\"derivative\\" or \\"disguised\\" or \\"unconscious communication\\"i.e. those communicative expressions which include implicit reference to unconscious experiences. Though awareness of derivative communication was not new to psychoanalytic clinical theory, he made listening for derivative communication a centerpiece of his theory of analytic practice. Langs differentiated \\"Type 1\\" derivatives, which refer solely to the client's internal experiences, and \\"Type 2\\" derivatives, which arise from the patient's attempts to adapt to reality, at times evoking psychic conflict. Over time, he would focus almost exclusively on \\"Type 2\\" derivatives, especially as they are discovered in the therapeutic relationship.Langs 1978; Langs 1981 In particular, Langs would use unconscious derivative communications from the patient as a way of validating or invalidating therapeutic interventions, an element of therapeutic practice he retains to this day. It is at this point that Langs began to call his approach the \\"communicative approach,\\" highlighting thereby the specific way of listening to clients' unconscious communication, as experienced in the therapeutic field. At times he would also term the approach \\"adaptational- interactional,\\" again focusing on (1) the adaptive character of psychic experiences and (2) the communication of the meaning of those experiences in therapy, via Type 2 derivatives, which are in part based on the interaction between patient and therapist. Over time, he would call the adaptive context a \\"trigger\\" and the interpretation of derivative communications‚Äîwhat Langs now typically calls \\"encoded communications\\"‚Äîin the light of adaptive triggers, \\"trigger decoding\\". Also during this phase, Langs not only had his own practice but was supervising other therapists. Langs began to notice frequent unconscious references to the breaking of therapeutic \\"ground rules\\"‚Äîa term which refers to the basic context or \\"frame\\" in which psychotherapy is practiced such as time, place, fee etc.. This highlighted for Langs the centrality of ground rules and framework for therapy, as well as the problems associated with modifying or, worse, violating the frame of therapy. Langs thus develops one of the hallmarks of his approach which has continued throughout his career, namely, an emphasis on the management of the ground rules and frame of psychotherapy and the many ways in which therapists appear to be unaware of the importance of the therapeutic frame for doing successful psychotherapy.Langs 1982  Discussion of the first two phases  All in all, Langs' work in these first two phases is deeply rooted in and yet simultaneously critical of the psychoanalytic tradition. Langs' early work borrows heavily from leading classical psychoanalysts, above all from Freud, as well as from authors in the broader psychoanalytic tradition such as Donald Winnicott, Wilfred Bion, Harold Searles, Ralph Greenson, Michael Balint and Willy and Madeleine Baranger. From the Barangers, Langs derives the notion of the \\"therapeutic field,\\" emphasizing that therapy is not only about the patient but about the interaction between patient and therapist.Langs 1976; Goodheart 1980; Kugler & Hillman 1985 This interaction, what Langs terms the \\"bi-personal field,\\"Langs 1976a includes many dimensions, which Langs analyzes in several supervision texts, drawing heavily from Winnicott and Balint.Langs 1976a; Langs 1978 Among the characteristics of this field, according to Langs, is that the client's unconscious perceptions of failure on the part of the therapist can lead to the patient to try to heal the therapist, a point Langs draws from Searles.Langs & Searles 1980 The impact of Langs' work on American psychoanalysis during this period would be difficult to overestimate. One indication of Langs' influence is the 1984 anthology Listening and Interpreting. The Challenge of the Work of Robert Langs, edited by James Raney MD. As Raney put it in his introduction, \\"In a little more than a decade, Robert Langs has made a remarkable contribution to the field of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. As a result of his determined search for the unconscious meanings of emotional disturbance, he has reworked older psychoanalytic ideas and introduced major innovations in psychotherapeutic understanding and technique.\\"Raney 1984, ix The articles of this collection aim to \\"extend, criticize, and apply Langs's ideas in novel areas from their unique clinical perspectives\\".Raney 1984, p. x Several widely known psychotherapists, such as Masud Khan, Merton Gill and Patrick Casement, contributed to this volume. Also during this period, Langs initiated book-length clinical dialogues with prominent psychoanalysts, including Harold Searles and Leo Stone,Langs & Stone 1980 as well as an extended discussion on transference and countertransference with Margaret Little.Little 1981 Langs' publications in this period produced many and varied reactions. Some reviewers considered Langs' work largely a rehashing of the classical psychoanalytic tradition without adding new insights though, as a rule, even those who asserted Langs' lack of originality were quick to point out that Langs always attributed credit to his sources.Werman 1980 Some also objected to the tone of Langs' work, suggesting that Langs was more confident in his conclusions than his work merited. In other cases, Langs' work was considered a significant advance over previous psychoanalytic texts. In particular, his work The Listening Process garnered high praise for articulating a proper listening and validating process for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, based on listening to derivative communications, something assumed but not as fully developed in the tradition as in Langs' work. Concerning the lack of developed technique for listening to unconscious derivative communications, one reviewer said that Langs' \\"book attempts to rectify these problems and in doing so,[Langs] identifies every meaningful component of the listening process, explores its basic dimensions, analyzes the intricacies of manifest and latent content of both client and therapist, warns of the dangers of countertransference-based influences, and clearly elucidates the psychoanalytic basis of the listening process.\\"Shave 1979 A further area of controversy was Langs' insistence on the potential contribution of the therapist or analyst to defenses and/or resistances in patients.Cohen 1982 A common criticism of his work in this period was that his emphasis on an ideal frame and an ideal of technique was too constricting. For example, Patrick Casement acknowledged that he was influenced by Langs' work,Casement 1984 yet later distanced himself from it saying of Langs that he \\". . . thinks that there is only one right way of working analytically\\"Casement, 1990, p. 13 Langs' impact in this period was not was restricted to psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic therapists but, even at this point, extended especially to Jungian analysts as well. A leading Jungian analyst and noted founder of the \\"developmental school\\" of Jungian analysis,Samuels 1985 Michael Fordham, reviewed Langs' two-volume The Therapeutic Interaction. Fordham describes Langs' book in glowing terms, noting how much more developed Langs' work in technique is compared to anything in the analytical (Jungian) psychology of the time.Fordham 1987 Parks considered this Fordham review the start of Langs' influence on Jungians.Parks 1987 Among the Jungians most impacted by Langs was William Goodheart, who not only utilized his work in his own research,Goodheart 1980; Goodheart 1987a; Goodheart 1987b; Goodheart 1988a; Goodheart 1988b; Goodheart 1988-9; Goodheart 1989; Goodheart 1993; Parks 1987 but defended the value of Langs' work in dialogue with Jungians critical of Langs, such as James Hillman.Kugler & Hillman 1985  Third phase  Langs' third and fourth phases are motivated by different sets of issues and can plausibly be described as distinct phases. Nonetheless it is the investigations and conclusions derived from both phases together that constitute Langs' current approach, which he has most recently termed \\"the adaptive paradigm of psychotherapy\\".Langs 2004a The third phase in Langs' work, stretching roughly from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, was motivated by a new set of clinical puzzles. The immediate clinical issue for Langs was that, on the one hand, patients in secured-frame therapy settings‚Äîi.e. unconsciously validated therapy with an ideal set of ground rules‚Äîtended to encode images validating both the therapy and the frame. On the other hand, these same patients appeared to flee from secured-frame therapy and the boundaries it requires, often ending therapy abruptly and without warning. According to him, when the anxieties these patients unconsciously communicated were decoded, it appeared that existential death anxieties were at the root of the patients' reactions. These factors entailed a set of puzzles requiring some level of resolution, including why the mind would react against what it knows unconsciously to be healing? And why indeed is there such a discrepancy between consciousness and the unconscious, such that consciously one is fleeing therapy which unconsciously is perceived to be healing? Indeed, why is there any differentiation between conscious and unconscious at all?Langs 1993; Langs 2004a Langs found that the clinical literature did little to illuminate this set of problems. After many attempts to find answers to these and related questions, he turned to formal areas of research outside the clinical and psychoanalytic literature, especially to developments in evolutionary biology and the laws of primate communication, research which resulted in a quantitative science of emotionally charged communication in both therapy in particular and life in general.Langs 1996; Langs, Badalamenti & Thomson 1996 Langs' work in this period takes on a more straightforwardly biological cast than his previous work and the mind is understood in terms of natural, evolutionary processes. Among the developments in this phase of his work is a complex differentiation of distinct mental functions (\\"mental modules\\") which articulate the mind in terms of both conscious-unconscious and deep unconscious systems, along with other auxiliary mental modules. Langs sought to explain biologically why these distinct mental modules function as they do. By working through the evolutionary and communicative problems, he came to believe that the evolutionary selection processes favors minds which are prone to death denial, since the alternative appeared to be facing potentially overwhelming anxiety over the inevitability of death. A product of this research was Langs' break with the standard psychoanalytic model of the mind. In Langs' account, Freud's later structural model of the mind, with its emphasis on the difference of id, ego, and superego resulted in the loss of Freud's deepest insights. The crucial original discovery of Freud, according to him, is contained in the earlier topographical model of mind, in which there are two profoundly diverse mental systems, the conscious system and the unconscious system. In contrast, the structural model treats of the unconscious as merely those contents of the ego, id or superego of which one is currently unaware, understating the profound differences between the conscious and unconscious systems and in practice modelling the unconscious on the conscious mind. Consequently, the most important insight contained in Freud's earlier, topographical model of the mind‚Äîthe stark difference between conscious and unconscious system‚Äîis, according to Langs, all but lost in the later model.Langs 1992; Langs 2004b; Langs 2010 Langs' own model of the mind accommodates elements from each of Freud's models while articulating something new. Langs distinguishes between the \\"unconscious\\" (or \\"superficial unconscious\\") and the \\"deep unconscious\\". The \\"unconscious\\" or \\"superficial unconscious\\" mind‚Äîthe descriptor \\"superficial\\" denoting a contrast with \\"deep,\\" not a value judgment‚Äîis a part of a complex conscious mental system with its own laws of functioning and its own form of communication. The \\"deep unconscious system,\\" in contrast, has a different set of functions and laws and also, a different form of communication. The latter, according to Langs, communicates in terms of encoded derivatives, in part because straightforward conscious communication about death-related traumas would be too difficult to bear. Hence the work of the adaptive therapist includes learning to hear the encoded derivative communications both to discover the sources of psychic conflict which arise from the diverse points of view the conscious and unconscious systems have on life events, with a specific focus on death anxiety and death-related traumas and, second, to obtain encoded validation of therapeutic interventions. A potential critique of classical psychoanalytic practice is contained in Langs' new model of the mind, namely, that standard psychoanalytic practice only touches on the unconscious or superficial unconscious, without ever getting to the deep unconscious, which can only be accessed through encoded derivative communications.Langs 1992; Langs 2004a; Langs 2010; White 2012 During the period, Langs wrote a number of popular texts and books written for clients rather than for therapists. Among these are popular texts on dreamsLangs 1988 and on unconscious communication,Langs 1983; Gutheil 1983 a workbook designed to measure the value of one's psychotherapist,Langs 1989 and a book on doing self-analysis.Langs 1993 Langs also published a book on self-processing classes.  Fourth phase  The fourth phase of Langs' career, from about the mid-90s until the end of his life, came in the wake of this expanded view of the psyche, and led to new clinical theses. His work linking evolutionary biology to the unconscious psyche required that Langs turn his attention to the problem of extinction and, with it, death and death anxiety. His researches in this field yielded the conclusion that death anxieties and death-related traumas lie at the root of psychic conflict. The deep unconscious system contains, among other things, intense experiences associated with death, because the conscious mind feels too overwhelmed by them. Consequently, due to evolutionary alterations of the emotion-processing mind, denial and obliteration rather than repression are the basic defenses of the psyche.Langs 2004a; Langs 2004b He distinguishes three kinds of death anxiety: predatory, predator and existential. Predatory death anxiety arises from the feeling that one may be or may become a victim of someone else‚Äôs death desires. Predator death anxiety arises from the experience of wanting to kill or harm someone else and includes accompanying guilt. Existential death anxiety, the most difficult to face, consists in the straightforward awareness that one will and must die. Each of these forms of death anxiety have their distinct effects on the conscious mind. For example, with unconscious predator anxiety comes the tendency to self-punishing behaviors and unexplained but profound guilt. This differentiation of various kinds of unconscious death anxiety also illustrates how Langs‚Äô more recent work integrated his earlier work. For example, much of Langs‚Äô early work focused on the importance of therapists honoring the therapeutic frame and its boundaries. Langs‚Äô later development of death anxiety offers an explanation of why clients (and therapists) may avoid keeping to strict therapeutic boundaries, namely, that honoring them may evoke anxiety about the inevitable boundary beyond which no human can survive: death. Furthermore, successfully secured-frame therapies tend to bring patients to a deeper awareness of their own unconscious death anxieties, which itself can lead to the termination of therapy if the patient experiences these anxieties as overwhelming. Nonetheless, facing these anxieties and learning how to process the emotional experiences which arise from them, is one of the key purposes of the adaptive approach to therapy. Langs' emphasis on how to listen to the deep unconscious system allows for the development of his proposed scientific approach to psychoanalysis. According to him, much of contemporary psychoanalytic practice is not conducive to understanding the deep unconscious, in part because the images and models of the unconscious which underlie contemporary psychoanalytic theory are derived from the images and models of the conscious system. Furthermore, there are strong motives, rooted in death anxiety, even for psychoanalysts to deny or ignore the deep unconscious system and substitute what amount to merely repressed conscious system contents for the genuine deep unconscious system. The deep unconscious system, on his account, is of quite another order from the conscious system and thus requires both a different way of perceiving it (listening to it) and a different model of mind from those derived from the conscious system. Langs defines a way of listening to the deep unconscious system, through trigger-decoded interpretations, making it possible, he believes, to understand the deep unconscious system as well as to operationalize unconscious perceptions in a meaningful scientific way. Some of Langs' later work concerning the deep unconscious and issues associated with death anxiety displays derivations from or parallels to ideas associated with Carl Jung's later theories, in particular Langs' use of Jung's notion of the \\"archetypes\\".Langs 2010; White 2012 It had been noted earlier that Langs' emphasis on the frame suggested a closer link to Jung than Freud,Badalamenti 1996 and Langs appears to link up his latest work more explicitly with Jung. Lang's death anxiety theory also highly correlates to the ideas and findings of Stanislav Grof, a psychiatrist and one of the founders of the field of transpersonal psychology.Grof 1980; Grof 1985  The Adaptive Paradigm of Psychotherapy  If Langs' third and fourth phases together can be said to constitute his later position, \\"the adaptive paradigm of psychotherapy,\\" it is safe to say that these developments were not greeted with the same enthusiasm as the work of Langs' second phase was. Langs' new emphasis on the biological and evolutionary basis of psychoanalytic theory and practice was baffling to many. One reviewer suggested that Langs' idea that psychoanalysis is biological science is a myth of Langs' own making.Movahedi 2000 Other reviewers considered Langs' later achievements considerable but less important and less original than Langs himself thought. Some discussions of Langs' later views echoed criticisms of the earlier period. The Jungian August Cwik praised Lang's book on supervision,Langs 1994 on many grounds and concludes that \\"Langs has once again given us food for thought\\". Nonetheless, Cwik added that Langs, \\"with some tempering of his extreme sense of certainty, [has] illuminated a teaching interaction which is at the core of our craft.,.Cwik 1996 Langs' efforts to understand death anxiety in his fourth phase led more or less naturally to investigations into religion and spirituality, since religions often deal with death, with claims to life after death, and with other death-related themes. Langs' book on the topic met with mixed reviews. Abramovitch, a Jungian analyst and scripture scholar, gave negative reviews to Langs' efforts, suggesting that Langs was out of his league to even treat of the issues.Abramovitch 2008 In contrast, the psychoanalyst and Jesuit William Meissner considered the book \\"a provocative and thought-provoking account that will challenge many of the convictions and persuasions of analytically oriented thinkers about these topics\\".Meissner 2009 The adaptive approach is in essence and per se a biological science by definition. It is by its nature a component of the science of evolutionary biology whose central task entails the scientific study of the evolution and adaptive resources of the emotionprocessing mind.\\"Robert Langs 1929-2015\\" Retrieved on 09 Jan 2018 As a whole, the third and fourth phases of Langs' work have not been met with the interest or enthusiasm of his first two phases. Langs acknowledged this state of affairs, but also suggested that at least some of the lukewarm reception of his work might have been due to the unpleasantness of the message, namely, that the roots of psychic conflict are in death-related trauma and anxiety, requiring therefore of both patient and therapist that they face their own death anxieties head-on.  Some characteristics of the Adaptive Paradigm   A way of listening  The most characteristic feature of Langs' approach to psychotherapeutic practice is his way of listening to the patient, focusing on unconscious derivative or encoded communications which express latent, deep unconscious experiences and perceptions.Langs 1978; Langs 2004 Though listening for encoded derivatives is certainly found in the psychoanalytic tradition, traditional psychoanalytic theory tended to interpret them as unconscious fantasies rather than adaptive responses to unconscious perceptions of reality, as Langs interprets them. There appears little current emphasis on listening to encoded derivatives in contemporary psychoanalytic practice. In contrast to contemporary practice, listening for encoded derivatives takes a central‚Äîindeed predominant‚Äîplace in Langs' work. Furthermore, in contrast to mainstream psychoanalysis, Langs connects derivative themes to \\"triggers,\\" i.e. activating events born of the patient's attempt to adapt consciously to the vicissitudes of life and both consciously and unconsciously to his or her early traumas. Whereas Langs' earlier work sought primarily frame and ground rule violations through encoded communications, there is now a greater emphasis on listening for encoded communications of patients' traumas. In this way, Langs emphasizes the adaptive nature of the unconscious psyche as a key for interpreting encoded derivatives and thus for understanding deep unconscious processes. Langs' approach differs from psychoanalytic approaches which treat the unconscious in purely intrapsychic terms, as opposed to giving primacy to processes of external adaptation.  Narratives  Not every form of communication on the part of a patient is productive of the unconscious encoded perceptions a Langsian therapist might seek. Langs' work in communication science draws the conclusion that narratives are the only source of such encoded derivative communication.Langs 1996; Langs 1997; Langs 2004 Narratives have the advantage of being a form of two-fold communication, having both a conscious manifest level and an unconscious latent level. When the patient recounts a dream or makes up a narrative, therefore, both levels can in principle be discerned and the unconscious communications can be decoded. For this reason, Langs retains the analytic practice of emphasizing the use of dreams and what he terms \\"guided associations\\" related to the elements and themes of the dreams, since dreams typically take the form of narratives and thus communicate unconscious encoded material. In any given case, the therapist may use spontaneously formulated narratives on the part of the client -- \\"origination narratives\\"‚Äîin the same way as a dream, since the key issue is whether the client offers narrative communications of any kind which can be decoded in terms of adaptive triggers. The client relates guided free associations to the themes of the narrative communication, producing a pool of themes which, in turn, illuminate unconscious conflicts. This practice too highlights a difference between Langs and mainstream psychoanalytic, Jungian and other depth-oriented approaches to therapy and analysis, in that traditional approaches tend to focus on the dream and use associations to elucidate the dream whereas Langs inverts the order of importance, considering the value of dreams to be that they attract associations from which the therapist can extract broader pools of themes for interpretation.Langs 1991; Langs 1993. Some non-adaptive psychoanalytic psychotherapists also treat dreams primarily as a source for associations. See e.g. Levy 1985  Death anxiety and death-related traumas  The ultimate triggers which result in psychic conflict are death-related traumas and the consequent death anxiety such traumas evoke. Thus the task of the adaptive psychotherapist is to aid the client to come to grips with such triggers and learn how to process the emotional traumas, past and present, associated with them. Langs' theory of mind, developed in the third phase of his work, highlights that what he terms the \\"deep unconscious system\\" is the locus of the unconscious perceptions and associated anxieties which are death-related. The reason for this is that what Langs calls the \\"emotion processing mind\\" has evolved in such a way that it separates out the deepest, most painful traumas (and aspects of trauma) from both the conscious and superficial unconscious experiences, stowing the painful and overwhelming traumas and anxieties in the deep unconscious system for the sake of easier conscious adaptation. While on some level this may be advantageous to the continuation of the species and, in that respect, beneficial to evolutionary aims, at another level it is a failed process. The members of the human species, on Langs' account, are therefore highly susceptible to denial and obliteration of the deepest traumas, more or less guaranteeing that they will not be healed and tending them to deep unconscious death anxieties, profound guilt, violent acting out and other emotional disturbances. Due to both the depth and the pain involved in these unconscious realities, they cannot be accessed directly, but only indirectly through encoded, narrative themes and their relationship to unconsciously perceived triggers. Hence the importance of listening for encoded derivative communications and themes expressed in narratives and seeking out the triggers which evoke them.  Securing the frame  Secured-frame therapy, which includes among other traits unconsciously validated ground rules, total privacy, total confidentiality, relative anonymity and several other characteristics Lang's delineates, is most beneficial for the patient dealing with death-related traumas and anxieties.Langs 1998; Langs 2004 At the same time, Langs' research suggests that this most healing therapeutic situation can also be a source of deep anxiety in the patient, because the clearly defined boundaries resonate in the deep unconscious as reminders of the ultimate boundary, death. Hence patients may flee secured-frame therapy both (1) because the secured frame evokes unconscious death anxiety, often driving patients to try to break the frame or (2) because, having experienced the security of the frame, the bringing of death anxiety to awareness itself produces overwhelming anxiety. It thus becomes incumbent on the adaptive therapist to manage both a patient's attempting to break the frame and the anxiety the patient may have within the secured frame, based on the overwhelming experience of death anxiety and allied experiences.  Recent directions  Dr. Langs died in November 2014 after a long struggle with amyloidosis. His most recent published book was entitled Freud on a Precipice. How Freud's Fate Pushed Psychoanalysis over the Edge,Langs 2010 which looks at the impact of Freud's biography on how the latter formulated his underlying theories. Among the points of interest for Freud interpretation is Langs' hypothesis that Freud changed from his topographical to structural theories in part because of his own death anxiety.Langs 2010; Freud 2012; White 2012 Besides several recently published articles, Langs was also working on a book- length study on American presidents and the traumas which have driven them. He was also working on a memoir, tentatively entitled The Devil is in the Genes.  Works (books only)  * Langs, R. (1972). LSD: Personality and Experience (With H. Barr, R. Holt, L. Goldberger, & G.

Retrieved 2012-12-20 Middle Ages Further Information: Medieval medicine of Western EuropeA Jewish physician in traditional costume, circa 1568; from the Wellcome Library The Book of Remedies, the earliest medical text written in Hebrew, to Asaph the Jew, dates to the seventh or eighth century. The text comprises four parts; a story of the transmission of medicine from God to mankind, a medical survey, a Materia medica and a list of medical aphorisms. While there is no knowledge of the writer himself or where the text was written, it circulated widely in Jewish communities during the Medieval period, and it can be assumed that it was of great influence to Jewish practictioners during this time. Though advances were made in gynaecology during the Middle Ages, the texts about gynaecology were written using the masculine form of Hebrew, indicating that gynecological texts were directed towards male doctors, not female midwives. The only mention of midwives in these texts seems to be when direct contact with a woman‚Äôs genitalia is necessary; only then do texts specifically mention the women involved in the procedure. In one instance, a text advised the doctor to \\"order the midwife to massage the orifice of her womb\\" with the herbs mentioned. Female practitioners contributed significantly both to the practice of medicine inside and outside of Jewish communities, and to the body of medical knowledge in Jewish community and beyond. From the surviving texts, it would seem that the greatest occurrence of female medical practitioners was during the 14th and 15th centuries. While women contributed to the advancement of Jewish medicine during this time, there were still a number of restrictions placed on them by society. No Jew, male or female, was permitted to attend a Christian university. This could be bypassed by taking an examination and acquiring a licentia curandi et practicandi, a license to practice medicine. In at least one case, this examination was specifically directed towards Jews who would work with Christian patients. As a result, the education of these women largely fell to their male relatives. Hava (also known as Hana), a Manoesque woman mentioned for her \\"medical capacity\\" in a document dated to the early 1320s, and Viridimura, a Sicilian who obtained her medical license in 1376, were female Jewish practitioners whose direct relatives‚ÄîHava's husband and sons, Virdimura's husband‚Äîwere practitioners as well. Jewish medical practitioners were often educated in Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew, which gave them access to medical texts that were often inaccessible to their Christian counterparts. Working as physicians, surgeons, and midwives, Jewish women were accepted as medical authorities in Paris, Florence, Naples, and Sicily, among other cities. Sara of St. Gilles, for instance, was a Jewish doctor who admitted a male Christian student, Salvetus de Burgonovo, in fourteenth century France. Shatzmiller believes this is enough evidence to indicate that Sara taught female students as well. Mayrona, a Jewish woman from Manoesque, France, is listed in over forty documents from 1342 as a phisica, or a licensed medical practitioner. Jewish midwives made up a larger percentage of practitioners in some regions than their population would suggest. In the French town of Marseille between 1390 and 1415, there are 24 known Jewish practitioners to 18 Christian ones; this is a shift from the period from 1337 to 1362 where Jewish doctors compromised approximately half of all practitioners in Marseille. Jewish practitioners participated in the exchange of knowledge between Christian and Muslim writers and practitioners. The degree to which Jewish women practiced midwifery in the Middle Ages depended largely on the areas in which they lived. In Iberia, for instance, Jews were well accustomed to a mix of Muslim, Christian, and their own Jewish culture. Along with this came a shared understanding of medicine; Jews living in this area even wrote medicinal texts in Judeo-Arabic (Arabic written in Hebrew letters) rather than standard Hebrew or the local vernacular Here, it was commonplace for Jewish midwives to work alongside Christian and Muslim women. However, Jewish women still faced adversity and discrimination on the basis of both their gender and their religion. This is more clearly demonstrated in Central Europe, where it is difficult to determine if Jewish midwives working for non-Jewish patients was common practice or, instead, the exception rather than the rule. In 1403, Floreta d‚ÄôAys, a Jewish midwife from Marseilles, was brought to court under charges of malpractice. This is the first such known case brought against a midwife and, according to Monica Green, an unusual case of anti-Jewish sentiment in an otherwise relatively tolerant town. While the end result of the trial is unknown, it's clear that Floreta's non-Christian status played a part in the charges levied against her.

Throughout his career, he was known as \\"Banquo\\" Stride. Football career In his youth, Stride was an all-round sportsman, who was described as an athlete \\"par excellence\\", winning many prizes as a runner with the Southampton Athletic Association. He started his football career with Freemantle before joining the short-lived Southampton Harriers club. The Harriers had started life as the Temperance Amateur Athletic Association but changed their name in 1885. In 1887, they decided to enter the inaugural Hampshire Junior Cup unlike Freemantle who declined the invitation; as a consequence, many Freemantle players, including Stride, signed on for the Harriers instead. On 10 March 1888, Harriers met St. Mary's in the first final of the Hampshire Junior Cup. The first match, played at the County Cricket Ground ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, with St. Mary's taking the replay on 24 March by a 2‚Äì1 margin, thus winning the trophy for the first time. In the summer of 1888, the Freemantle club acquired their own ground in Southampton following which, most of the Harriers' players returned, with the exception of Stride, who joined St. Mary's. In the third round of the Hampshire Junior Cup, St. Mary's were drawn to play Fordingbridge Turks on 12 January 1889. Stride and three other St. Mary's players had been selected to play for the Hampshire F.A. against Berks & Bucks on the same day. St. Mary's tried to get the match against the Turks re-arranged but the New Forest club refused. Consequently, St. Mary's withdrew their four players from the county match to play in the cup. The \\"Saints\\" won the match (played at the Antelope Ground) 3‚Äì2, earning them a semi-final appearance against Cowes. St. Mary's eventually defeated Cowes after three replays, going on to retain the trophy, defeating Christchurch in the final. In 1891, St. Mary's had a relatively straightforward passage to the final of the Hampshire Junior Cup, where they defeated Lymington 2‚Äì0. Having won the cup for three consecutive years, the Saints retained the trophy permanently. In the following season, St. Mary's entered the Hampshire Senior Cup for the first time and reached the final against the winners of the two previous years, the Royal Engineers based at Aldershot. In the final, played at the County Ground on 14 March 1891, the Saints took an early lead through Ernie Nicholls before the engineers equalised. Two second-half goals, from Frank Bromley and Bob Kiddle, saw St. Mary's claim the senior cup for the first time. The success in local cup competitions prompted the club committee to enter a national tournament for the first time ‚Äì in the First Qualifying Round of the FA Cup on 3 October 1891, they played at Warmley near Bristol, winning comfortably 4‚Äì1, with Stride playing at right-half. In the next round, St. Mary's defeated Reading 7‚Äì0 but the match was awarded to Reading following an FA enquiry into the eligibility of two St. Mary's players, Jock Fleming and Alexander McMillan. In March 1892, St. Mary's retained the Hampshire Senior Cup, with an easy 5‚Äì0 victory over a Medical Staff team. In 1892‚Äì93, Stride played in both FA Cup matches, with the Saints going out 4‚Äì0 to Maidenhead, and in all three Hampshire Senior Cup matches, losing 1‚Äì2 to Freemantle in the final, in which Stride gave away a penalty for tripping Freemantle's forward, Horton. Stride did not play in the FA Cup matches in 1893‚Äì94, but did play in the later rounds of the Hampshire Senior Cup, when St. Mary's reached the final in March 1894, when they were defeated 1‚Äì0 by the Royal Engineers. In 1894, St. Mary's were founder members of the Southern League. Not wanting to commit to regular league football, Stride decided to retire from the club. Following his retirement from football, Stride continued to work in Southampton and was employed in the Borough Engineers department.

Husayn entered caliphal service in 895, and through his co-operation with the caliphal government, he established himself and his family as the leader of the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira, leading his troops to successful campaigns against the Qarmatians, Dulafids and Tulunids over the next few years. As one of the most distinguished generals of the Abbasid Caliphate, he rose in power and influence until 908, when he was one of the leading conspirators in the abortive coup against Caliph al-Muqtadir. Although the coup failed and Husayn was forced to flee the capital, he soon secured a pardon and served as governor in Jibal, where he again distinguished himself in military operations in south-central Iran. In ca. 911, he was appointed governor in Mosul, where he remained until rising in revolt in 914/5, for reasons that are unclear. Defeated and captured in 916, he was imprisoned in Baghdad, where he was executed in 918. Through his influence, the family rose to high offices, beginning a long period during which Mosul and the entire Jazira were ruled by the Hamdanids. His nephews, Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al- Dawla, went on to establish autonomous emirates in Mosul and Aleppo respectively.  Biography   Origin and early career  Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty Husayn was a son of the Hamdanid family's patriarch, Hamdan ibn Hamdun. His family belonged to the Banu Taghlib tribe, established in the Jazira since before the Muslim conquests. In a pattern repeated across the Abbasid Caliphate, the Taghlibi leaders took advantage of the collapse of central caliphal authority during the decade-long Anarchy at Samarra (861‚Äì870) to assert increasing control over their particular area, centred on Mosul.Kennedy (2004), pp. 265‚Äì266 Hamdan established himself among the leading tribal leaders during this time, and led the resistance against caliphal attempts to restore direct control, even allying with the Kharijite rebels in the 880s. Finally, in 895 Caliph al-Mu'tadid launched a determined attack to recover the Jazira. Hamdan fled before the Caliph's advance and was captured after a long pursuit and thrown in prison.Kennedy (2004), p. 266Canard (1971), p. 126 Husayn, however, who had been entrusted with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al- Shari, thereby bringing an end to the Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense.Canard (1971), pp. 619‚Äì620Kennedy (2004), pp. 182, 266 This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the words of the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, > to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own > skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the > Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family > military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government > services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as > an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira > that al-Husayn made the family fortune.  In Abbasid service  Map of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids Husayn led his Taghlibi regiment with distinction over the next few years. He fought against the Dulafid Bakr ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Ahmad ibn Abi Dulaf in the Jibal in 896. After 903 he played a decisive role in the campaigns of Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib against the Qarmatians of the Syrian desert, where his experienced cavalry was crucial in countering the highly mobile Qarmatians. In 903 he participated in Muhammad's major victory over the Qarmatian leader al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh, better known by his laqab of \\"Sahib al-Shama\\", near Hama. The Qarmatian leaders fled to the desert, but were soon captured, and brought in triumph to Baghdad.Kennedy (2004), pp. 184, 266‚Äì267, 286 Husayn then participated as commander of the vanguard in Muhammad's 904‚Äì905 campaign that ended the Tulunid dynasty and restored Syria and Egypt to direct caliphal control. Muhammad ibn Sulayman reportedly offered him the governorship of Egypt, but Husayn refused, preferring to return to Baghdad with the enormous booty he had collected.Kennedy (2004), pp. 184‚Äì185 On his return from Egypt, in 905‚Äì906, Husayn was sent against the Banu Kalb of Syria, who had risen in revolt at the instigation of the Qarmatians. Although he drove them into the desert, the Kalbis filled up the wells as they retreated, and he was unable to follow them. As a result, the rebels were able to reach the Lower Euphrates, where they defeated another Abbasid force at al-Qadisiyya and raided the hajj caravan of the Mecca pilgrims (late 906). In the end, the forces of the central government defeated the Qarmatians and drove them to flight. On their retreat back to Syria along the Euphrates, they were attacked and annihilated by Husayn in March/April 907. Although these victories did not entirely remove the Qarmatian threat‚Äîthe Qarmatians based in Bahrayn continued to remain active and raided lower Iraq‚Äîthey signalled the near-eradication of the sect from Syria.Kennedy (2004), p. 185 Husayn then subdued the remaining Kalbi rebels between the Euphrates and Aleppo, and in 907‚Äì908 confronted and drove back into Syria the Banu Tamim who had invaded the Jazira seeking pillage, defeating them near Khunasira. By 908, this distinguished service had established Husayn as \\"one of the leading generals\\" (Kennedy) in the Caliphate, and enabled him to advance his own brothers to positions of power: they received various offices, the most important of which was the award of the governorship of Mosul to Husayn's brother Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah in 905.Kennedy (2004), p. 267 In December 908, Husayn became involved in a palace plot to depose the new Caliph, al-Muqtadir, in favour of the older Ibn al- Mu'tazz. Along with two others, on 17 December 908 he attacked and killed the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i, who had endorsed al-Muqtadir's accession. The conspirators then sought to kill the young caliph as well, but the latter had barricaded himself in the Hasani Palace. Ibn al-Mu'tazz was proclaimed as caliph, and Husayn went to the palace to persuade al-Muqtadir to surrender. However, the unexpected resistance of the palace servants under the chamberlains Sawsan, Mu'nis al-Fahl and Mu'nis al-Khadim, and the plotters' indecision, doomed the coup. Al-Muqtadir prevailed, and Husayn fled from Baghdad to Mosul and to Balad. He then spent some time wandering with his followers across the Jazira. The caliph sent Husayn's own brother, Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah, to pursue him, but Husayn managed to surprise and defeat him. This success encouraged him to contact the new vizier, Ali ibn al-Furat, through the mediation of his brother Ibrahim. Although he had been a leading figure in the conspiracy, and most of the other participants in the coup were executed or imprisoned, Husayn succeeded in receiving a pardon. He was not welcomed back to Baghdad, however, but appointed governor of Qumm and Kashan in the Jibal. As governor, he aided Mu'nis al-Khadim in his campaign against the Saffarid al-Layth ibn Ali in Sijistan and Fars, and later against the former Saffarid general and rebel Subkara and his lieutenant al-Qattal. The Abbasid forces under Mu'nis al-Khadim succeeded in suppressing the rebellion by 910/1, with al-Qattal being captured by Husayn in person, according to a celebratory poem by the later Hamdanid poet Abu Firas. Abu Firas further reports that Husayn was offered the governorship of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who probably still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders. The reason for Husayn's execution is unclear. The historian of the Hamdanid dynasty, Marius Canard, suggested that it may have been due to his involvement in a Shi'a-inspired conspiracy, possibly connected to the dismissal of Ibn al-Furat from his second vizierate during the same period, or with the rebellion of the autonomous governor of Adharbayjan, Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, whom al-Muqtadir may have suspected of ties with the imprisoned Husayn. As Canard writes, \\"in any case the caliph must have feared that if Husayn were released he would once again start a revolt, either through a desire for independence or as a Shi'i. In order to avoid attempts by those (probably numerous) who desired his release to secure it by force, the caliph preferred to take a measure which put a stop to all intrigue\\". Despite Husayn's rebellion and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al- Khadim and sharing in the ups and downs of the court politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan and Ali, better known by their honorific titles Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, who established the family as the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.Kennedy (2004), pp. 267‚Äì282Canard (1971), pp. 126‚Äì131  Character and assessment  According to Canard, Husayn \\"stands out more clearly than the supreme commander Mu'nis or any other military leaders\\" of the period for his ability and valour, as well as for his restive and ambitious spirit. He was also singled out in being of Arab descent, an unusual case among the Caliphate's senior leaders of the period. Canard assesses him as unusually open-minded, and attuned to the ideological turmoil and ferment in the Muslim world of his time, as indicated by his contact with the Sufi mystic al-Hallaj, who dedicated a work on politics to Husayn. Indeed, according to Canard, Husayn's espousal of Shi'ism, and his participation in the abortive coup of 908, can best be seen in light of a desire‚Äîtypical of Shi'a sympathisers‚Äîfor a renewal of the Caliphate and the establishment of an \\"ideal Muslim government\\", something which the corrupt and decadent Abbasids were no longer capable of. Finally, although it fell to his brother to found the actual Hamdanid dynasty, it was Husayn who first gave his family a taste of power and glory, for which he was later celebrated in the poetry of Abu Firas.
