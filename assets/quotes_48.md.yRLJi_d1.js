Deeds was elected the club's first president (1914‚Äì1915). Through a connection of Kettering, the club was originally permitted to meet at a property owned by Delco Electronics located on the corner of Second and Madison streets in Dayton. As membership grew, the need for a new, permanent location became evident and a building committee, funded by Deeds and Kettering, planned the construction of the present location of the club on Monument Avenue. On February 2, 1918, the club's new home, designed by the Dayton firm of Schenck & Williams, was dedicated in front of more than 300 members and guests. Commemorating the occasion, Orville Wright gave a rare public speech. He emphasized the responsibility of the membership, both present and future.

The train runs on Indian Railways broad gauge track network and was introduced in 2008 to provide quicker connectivity from India's capital New Delhi to locations in Gujarat. Schedule The Gujarat Sampark Kranti Express runs three days a week. As of 1 November 2009, 2917 departs ADI every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 1720 and arrives at NZM at 1040 on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, averaging 65 km/h speed during its run. 2918 departs NZM every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 1355 and arrives at ADI at 610 on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, averaging 69 km/h speed. India Rail Info In its journey, the train passes through the Indian states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi. Some cities where the Gujarat Sampark Kranti Express halts en route are Nadiad, Chhayapuri (Vadodara), Godhra, Dahod, Ratlam, Kota and Mathura. The entire route of the train is on double-line electrified track section of Indian Railways. Route & Halts * '''''' * * * ()  * ''''''  Rake The train's rake is split into at least three classes of reserved travel: AC 2 Tier (code: A/2A), AC 3 Tier (code:B/3A) and non air-conditioned reserved sleeper (SL). As it is a Sampark Kranti train, between 2 and 6 carriages requiring no previous travel reservation (code: General) are included. Along with Maharashtra Sampark Kranti and West Bengal Sampark Kranti, this train now runs LHB coaches. These three trains are the only Sampark Kranti Expresses to have LHB coaches. Locomotive Both trains hauled by based WAP 7 (HOG) equipped locomotive on its entire journey.  Other details  The passenger fare between ADI and NZM varies from INR (Indian rupee) 1400 (A/2A) to INR 190 (General). Though its route is 150 km longer than the Ashram Express, the Gujarat Sampark Kranti averages a higher speed and takes 15 minutes less than the Ashram Express to travel from Delhi to Ahmedabad. This is attributable to the fact that the Samprak Kranti Express gets the benefit of electric traction, double line track and almost no stops outside Gujarat on its entire route. Gujarat Sampark Kranti Express is designated as a superfast train, which denotes that it gets priority over local (commuter) trains, standard express and passenger trains and most freight trains.

Here, sailors exchanged packets of letters left under postal stones. This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Cape of Good Hope. Postal stone (1632) The Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, led by the explorer Bartolomeu Dias. Table Bay, for over one hundred years known as Saldanha (named after one of Albuquerque's sea captains), became a convenient harbor on the long, hard and dangerous sea voyage to the East. Here letters were left and exchanged with ships sailing back to Europe. Frequently, packets of letters were left under postal stones inscribed in French, Dutch and Danish, which became the first, unmanned, post offices of the Cape. The earliest of these, dated 1619, was inscribed in English.D. Alan Stevenson, The Triangular Stamps of the Cape of Good Hope, H.R. Harmer, Ltd., New York, London, and Sydney (1950), p. 6. Illustrated, Plate 2.Robson Lowe, The Encyclopaedia of British Empire Postage Stamps, v. II: The Empire in Africa, London (1949), p. 33.\\"Colonial Post and Telegraph Diary of the Cape of Good Hope\\", francofrescura.co.za On line. A supply camp was established by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 in the area which later became Cape Town. It was first occupied by British Forces in 1795. Since 1814 it was a British Colony until it was incorporated into the Union of South Africa, as the Cape Province, on 31 May 1910. The first triangular stamps 4d Cape Triangular, SG 19 Stamps were first issued by the colony on 1 September 1853. The two stamps that were issued were a one penny in brick-red and a four pence in blue. The unusual shape of the stamps was probably inspired by the large triangular obliterator used by the Cape Revenue Department from 1839. The stamps were printed by Messrs Perkins, Bacon & Co in London. The original die for these stamps was cut by William Humphrys, an engraver employed by Perkins Bacon.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 1 British Commonwealth, 1999, p.561Melville, Fred J, Postage Stamps in the Making, 1916, p.68 Sheets of a special handmade paper, measuring 282 mm by 536 mm, were used to print 240 stamps per sheet. The stamps were issued imperforate. The rate of postage within the colony was 4d for a half ounce letter and 1d for a newspaper.Melville, Fred J, Cape of Good Hope, Melville Stamp Books, 1913 On 18 February 1858 two new values became available: a six pence and a one shilling. The six pence rate was for payment of half ounce letters to Great Britain and the one shilling rate was for postage to some foreign countries. On 15 September 1860 the rate for local letters in Cape Town was reduced to 1d. A similar reduction was made in Port Elizabeth on 1 May 1861. On 1 April 1863 the rate to Great Britain was increased to one shilling, if sent by mail packet, and reduced to four pence, if sent by private vessels. The triangular stamps were demonetised on 1 October 1900. The so-called Wood-Blocks Prints from the original wood-blocks Due to a shortage of one penny and four pence stamps, a local printer, Messrs. Saul Solomon & Co., was employed to provide a supply of one penny and four pence stamps, and these were issued in February 1861. It was then discovered that a consignment of stamps from London had already arrived, on 5 May 1860, although the bills of lading had gone astray. A year later the cases with the stamps from London were claimed. Despite the popular nickname, the stamps were in fact engraved on steel. Each stamp was individually cut into a single piece of metal (known as a cliche) so there are many slight variations. 64 cliches were then glued to wooden blocks for printing. Two were accidentally placed into the wrong set, resulting in one colour error per sheet of 64 - a blue penny stamp and a red four pence stamp - which have always been highly prized rarities. Hope issues In 1864, a new issue replaced the triangular issues. This showed the allegorical figure of Hope seated with a ram and vines. Until 1893, this was the only design except for the triangulars. In 1893, a 1d stamp was issued portraying Hope standing, and in 1898 and 1902, this design was reused for 1/2d and 3d values. The sitting Hope stamps continued to be issued until 1898. Later issues In 1900, a 1d stamp was issued showing Table Mountain and the Arms of the Colony. This was the first stamp not portraying Hope. The final issue, between 1902 and 1904, was a set of nine values portraying King Edward VII. Union of South Africa In 1910, the Union of South Africa was formed from the colonies of Cape of Good Hope, Transvaal, Natal and Orange River Colony. All Cape stamps except the triangulars were valid for use in all of the Union until they were demonetised on 31 December 1937, along with the issues of Transvaal, Natal and Orange River Colony.  Postal stationery  Cape of Good Hope 1882 newspaper wrapper with overprint for Argus Daily The first items of postal stationery to be issued by the Cape of Good Hope were postcards in 1878; registration envelopes and newspaper wrappers were first issued in 1882; post paid envelopes in 1892 and lettercards in 1895.Higgins & Gage World Postal Stationery CatalogSehler, Norbert, Neuer Ganzsachen-Katalog Afrika 2007 The designs of all the postal stationery used the head of either Queen Victoria or King Edward VII apart from the very first postcard, issued in 1878, which had a design of ‚ÄúHope‚Äù.

In November 2009 the Israeli navy boarded the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea, suspecting that it was carrying weapons destined for Hezbollah from the Islamic Republic of Iran in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Hundreds of tons of weapons were found on the ship, which was then directed to berth in Israel.  Background  Built by Sietas of Neuenfelde and completed in August 2003, the ship was launched as Tavastland. It measures long, with a beam of and a draught of . Its MaK 9 M 43 diesel engine can reach a speed of . The ship has sailed under both the German and the British flags and is currently under the flag of Antigua and Barbuda. It is currently owned by the German company Francop Schiffahrts GmbH & Co. A Cypriot company, United Feeder Services, operates the vessel.  Boarding incident  On 4 November 2009, in an operation named Operation Four Species,http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126397.html Israeli navy commandos of Shayetet 13 boarded the ship in the eastern Mediterranean Sea without resistance, acting on intelligence reports which it had received. The ship was about off the coast of Israel, near Cyprus. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the ship was carrying \\"dozens of shipping containers, carrying numerous weapons, disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board\\". The IDF also claimed that the weapons originated from Iran and were to be directed to Hezbollah. The navy said that the crew was not aware of the purported smuggling and cooperated with Israeli commandos. After the boarding, the Israeli Navy directed the ship to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where a thorough inspection was held. According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in Damietta, Egypt; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from Bandar-Abbas, Iran on 25 October. The ship was then set to sail to Limassol, Cyprus and then Latakia, Syria. The IDF suspects that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the 2006 Lebanon War. Following the war, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah. An Israeli naval official claimed that the amount of weapons found is ten times more than that found during Operation Noah's Ark. The arms shipment weighed 320 tons and were held in containers marked with Iranian shipping codes. The seized weaponry included 9,000 mortar shells, thousands of 107-mm Katyusha rockets, 600 122-mm rockets, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The arms shipment was the largest ever seized by Israeli authorities. On 5 November 2009, ambassadors and diplomats from 44 countries and military attaches from 27 armies in the world were invited by the IDF and the Foreign Ministry in order for them to be witnesses of the many weapons and accumulation of ammunition that were found on the Francop ship.

Biography Tellier grew up in West Haven, Connecticut and was a high school football All-American, playing for his father in 1968 at Notre Dame High School of West Haven, CT. He attended the University of Connecticut and lead that team to the Yankee Conference title in 1971. After graduating from Connecticut in 1973, Tellier entered the coaching ranks, serving as an assistant at Connecticut, Dartmouth College, Wabash College, and Boston University during the 1970s. In 1978, he became offensive coordinator at Brown University under head coach John A. Anderson. Brown was experiencing a revival in football at the time and Tellier's time there was a successful one. When Anderson resigned in 1983, Tellier moved on to become head coach at University of Rochester, an NCAA Division III school. He turned the moribund program around over the next five years, going 9‚Äì2 and making the NCAA Division III playoffs for the first time in school history, in 1987. His overall record at Rochester was 21‚Äì26‚Äì1. In 1989 Tellier was hired by Columbia and asked to revive their program (which had just broken a 44-game losing streak) in a similar fashion. His results were mixed. Significant improvement did not begin to be seen until 1994 and in 1996 the team would win eight games for the first time since 1945. But thereafter the team slowly declined again until by 2002 the team was again winless in the Ivy League. Tellier stepped aside at the end of that season and joined the administrative side of the athletic department. In 2005, he was appointed an associate athletics director and continues to serve in that capacity.

Proceedings of the University of Cambridge Interdisciplinary Graduate Conference, June 2010, Cambridge, United Kingdom It has been argued, however, that this definition is tainted by Western biases, not least a bias for mimesis, art as imitation of life and nature.Francesca Aniballi, \\"Ceremony: A Case Study in Literary Anthropology\\", in \\"Diverse Engagement: Drawing in the Margins\\", Matthew French, Simon Jackson, Elina Jokisuu (eds). Proceedings of the University of Cambridge Interdisciplinary Graduate Conference, June 2010, Cambridge, United Kingdom Furthermore, Spindler‚Äôs typology of magic realism has been criticized as \\"an act of categorization which seeks to define Magic Realism as a culturally specific project, by identifying for his readers those (non-modern) societies where myth and magic persist and where Magic Realism might be expected to occur. There are several objections to this type of analysis. It needs to be recognized that models of Western rationalism may not actually describe Western modes of thinking and it is certainly possible to conceive of instances where both these orders of knowledge are simultaneously possible.\\"Liam Connell , \\"Discarding Magic Realism: Modernism, Anthropology, and Critical Practice,\\" in ARIEL, Vol. 29, No. 2, April, 1998, pp. 95-110. In his Ph.D. dissertation, \\"Magical Insurrections: Cultural Resistance and the Magic Realist Novel in Latin America\\", Spindler discusses extensively the cultural issues that magic realism brings about in Latin American narrative.

He was raised in the Mennonite village of Rosenthal, part of the Chortitza Colony, but later settled in the U.S.  Biography  Isaak worked in a bookstore in Odessa, Ukraine, where he reportedly became a Nihilist. He fled Czarist police for Rio de Janeiro in about 1889. In 1890 he moved to the U.S. and lived in San Francisco before relocating to Portland, Oregon. In Portland Isaak became a member of the Socialist Labor Party and in 1895 founded the anarchist weekly, the Firebrand, with American-born Quaker Abner Pope and Henry Addis. Isaak would embrace anarchism after its followers were expelled following the formation of the Second International in 1889. Isaak was best known for his editing and publishing the American anarchist weeklies the Firebrand (1895‚Äì1897) and Free Society (1897‚Äì1904), Isaak was less a theorist than an activist. His acquaintances and friends included the Russian Anarchists Peter Kropotkin and Emma Goldman, along with American attorney Clarence Darrow, Settlement House founder, Jane Addams, and economist Thorsten Veblen. In 1897, authorities closed the Firebrand and arrested Isaak after its publication of Walt Whitman's poem, \\"A Woman Waits for Me,\\" along with several other articles which authorities deemed \\"obscene.\\" Isaak was arrested. Later, awaiting trial and out on bond, the Isaak family moved to San Francisco, where they founded Free Society. The Portland court later dismissed the charges against Isaak, Pope, and Addis. The Isaaks left San Francisco for Chicago in early 1901 leaving Pete in San Francisco. Seven months later, Isaak was propelled into national headlines after Leon Czolgosz, with no reported anarchist connections, shot U.S. President William McKinley in Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901. Coincidentally Isaak had met the would-be assassin days earlier in Chicago. Czolgosz's espousals of violence had aroused the suspicions of Abraham that he was a spy, and prompting Free Society to publish a warning against associating with Czolgosz. Following the shooting the Isaak family and anarchists across the country were arrested and jailed. The Isaaks were released later that September. Isaak came to regret his move to New York in 1904 where Free Society faced financial problems that forced its closure in November of that year. Emma Goldman's Mother Earth, which first appeared in 1906, was an attempt to fill the anarchists' subsequent literary void.  Political and ethical beliefs  Isaak only twice referred to his Mennonite past in the Firebrand and Free Society.See, respectively, the Firebrand, March 8, 1896 (microfilm reproduction) and Free Society, March 20, 1898, pg. 5. This extended quote is taken from the former: Although Isaak was an ex-Mennonite, he continued to espouse many traditional Anabaptist principles such as pacifism, mutual aid and socio-economic equality that Anarchist theorists have promoted and that Isaak believed represented the best of his own Mennonite tradition.  Personal life  In 1879, Abraham (or Abe) married Maria Dyck (1861‚Äì1934) and had three children: Pete (1880‚Äì?), Abe Jr. (1883‚Äì1953); and Mary (1885 to 1974). Descendants now live in Mexico and California. He was the second of 12 children born to Abraham Isaak (1832‚Äì1898) and Helena Wiebe (1835‚Äì1882).  Later life  By 1909, Abraham and Maria Isaak founded the anarchist-inspired Aurora Colony near Lincoln, California, having acquired a farm with monies Maria inherited from her family. Isaak, whose obituary in a local paper described him as a \\"colonization representative of Russian citizens living in Chicago and New York,\\" sold 25 parcels of land to about 19 different families whose lack of farming experience and infighting led to the colony's demise. The Isaaks and several other families continued to live on their parcels. Nothing suggests Isaak resumed newspaper work. In fact, he became involved in such establishment organizations as the Farm Bureau and other civic organizations. Maria Isaak died of pneumonia on April 17, 1934; Isaak, according to his death certificate, died of acute pancreatitis on December 10, 1937. Four years before his death Isaak wrote to his friend, Harry Kelly: \\"First, the railroads took our pears and plums and $70 to boot; the good Lord took our citrus fruit (by frost), and two weeks ago the Bank of Lincoln closed its doors, where we had our last savings....\\" He concluded: \\"Some 30 years ago Thorsten Veblen told me in Chicago that the machine would break capitalism sooner than the efforts of revolutionists, and it seems his prediction is coming true.\\"Printed in Freedom, February 25, 1933, pg. 3.

It was produced by Winans's own independent production company, Double Edge Films, with Kiowa K. Winans, and shot by cinematographer Jeff Pointer in locations around Denver, Colorado. The film premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on January 23, 2009, and has screened in Denver, the Cancun Film Festival (where it won the Best International Feature award\\"2033\\", \\"Entre nos\\" e \\"Ink\\", premiadas en las secciones competitivas de Canc√∫n), Rams Head Onstage in Baltimore and in a number of independent movie houses in cities around the US. The film was widely circulated in peer-to-peer networks, which led to its commercial success.  Plot  The film begins with a businessman, John Sullivan (Chris Kelly), in a hurry to get into his car. He appears to be severely stressed as he begins driving down the city streets. When he goes through a lighted intersection he is broadsided by another driver that is distracted by hot coffee in his lap. As he becomes unconscious, he dreams of playing with his young daughter, Emma (Quinn Hunchar). Emma pretends to be kidnapped and tells John to \\"save\\" her from the \\"monsters\\", although John seems exasperated and tells her to have her mother do it instead. Eventually, however, John gives in and runs to \\"save\\" his daughter, while Emma laughs and embraces him. It is revealed that dreams are controlled by beings from an alternate plane of reality. The beings are spirits of deceased people from earth and are divided into distinct groups: Storytellers (bearers of good dreams), Incubi (cause of nightmares), and Drifters (those in a state of limbo who cause neither good or bad dreams). As the Storytellers and Incubi perform their daily work in the night, a Drifter known as Ink goes to Emma's room and removes her soul from her body. Although a number of Storytellers try to prevent the action, Ink escapes with the girl's soul into the dreamworld, leaving Emma's body unconscious. However, in the dreamworld, Ink is unable to open a portal to the Incubi's headquarters, where he intends to take Emma's soul. He is told that he must find and barter with two other Drifters to acquire parts of a code that will enable him to achieve entry into the headquarters. Meanwhile, John, whose life has attained a sense of repetition and perfection, faces turmoil when an account he has been working to acquire is about to be swept out from under him. Soon after, Ron Evans (Steve Sealy), John's estranged father in law, comes to inform John that Emma is in a coma and has been placed in a hospital. Although Ron begs John to go and see the girl, John refuses and berates Ron, saying that the father-in-law turned the world against him. Shortly after, Ron is ordered out of John's office. It is revealed that Ron and his wife were given custody of Emma after the death of John's wife Shelly (Shannan Steele) in a car accident, due to John's grief- induced addiction to alcohol and drugs. At the same time in the dreamworld, the Storytellers Allel, Gabe, and Sarah (played by Jennifer Batter, Eme Ikwuakor, and Shelby Malone, respectively) work to find a way to awake Emma. In order to do this, they receive the help of Jacob (Jeremy Make), an eccentric blind spirit known as a \\"Pathfinder\\". Meanwhile, a Storyteller named (Jessica Duffy) confronts Ink and attempts to discourage him from delivering Emma to the Incubi. After Ink threatens to murder Emma if continues to pursue him, surrenders to Ink as a prisoner. It is revealed that Ink is taking Emma's soul to the Incubi in order to become one of them and cease to be a Drifter. Soon after, Ink successfully barters with two Drifters for parts of the code. As Ink's prisoner, tries to bolster Emma's bravery in order to thwart Ink. During this time, the Pathfinder Jacob unveils his abilities to the Storytellers: tapping into the \\"beat of the world\\" in order to cause physical changes that affect the course of time. Through a chain of events, Jacob causes several small accidents that culminate in a truck running a red light and crashing into John's car, revisiting an opening scene of the film. Due to his injuries, John is taken to a hospital, which turns out to be the same hospital where Emma is checked in. After recalling his happiness before his wife died, John walks to Emma's room, guarded by Allel as an unseen battle ensues between the Storytellers and Incubi. In the dreamworld, discovers that Ink arrived after his human counterpart committed suicide. Ink, being ashamed of his hideous and scarred appearance, believes the Incubi will help him; the Incubi having been revealed to all wear apparati that project facades of bliss and happiness to hide their misery. After making their way to the stronghold of the Incubi, Ink offers Emma and as his payment to the leader. As attempts to stand up to the leader of the Incubi, she is mortally wounded. While dying, pleads with Ink to \\"remember\\". Suddenly, Ink has a revelation: he recalls that Emma died in the hospital without her father's presence; and John, driven to further depression and regret, shot himself in despair, at which time his soul entered the dreamworld and became the Drifter known as Ink. Ink understands that he is, in fact, John Sullivan's soul from a future in which Emma dies and he does not visit her at the hospital (time flows differently in the dreamworld). In this realization, Ink rushes at the Incubi and kills them to rescue his daughter, mirroring the dream scene in the beginning of the film. After the fight is over, Emma's soul embraces Ink, realizing that it is her father. In the normal world, Pathfinder Jacob activates a device that calls the other Storytellers as reinforcement, with the onslaught of Storytellers defeating the Incubi. John finally makes his way to Emma's room. The film closes as Emma awakes to find her father at her bedside.

Jamin wrote, directed and edited, as well as composed the original soundtrack for the film, while Kiowa is credited for the Art Direction, Costume Design and Sound Design. As no big studio picked up the film for theatrical and home distribution, Double Edge Films pitched the film directly to independent cinemas and saw to the DVD, Blu-ray and online distribution themselves. DVD and Blu-ray copies are sold directly via the company's website starting from October 30, 2009 and are sold at retail stores starting November 10, 2009, as well as downloads at Video on demand stores. The film was frequently pirated online at the time, and Jamin and Kiowa Winans wrote in their newsletter that they had \\"embraced the piracy\\" as it led to a larger audience and they were \\"happy Ink is getting unprecedented exposure.\\" Around Christmas 2009 the film was also released on Hulu for free viewing for a limited time.Hulu Blog: Exclusive Interview: ‚ÄúInk‚Äù  Reception  The film received generally positive reviews, both from audiences and critics. Film critics often noted the technical quality of the film even as an amateur, low- budget film. Critic Robert Abele (Los Angeles Times) said \\"there's a rapacious DIY showmanship at work here reminiscent of the calling-card chutzpah Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson showed in scrappier, pre-blockbuster days.\\" Luke Y. Thompson of LA Weekly ranked the film positively and remarked, ‚ÄúInk has all the ambition of a Terry Gilliam or Jean-Pierre Jeunet epic, but since none of the studios bit, the writer-director decided to make it himself with next-to- no money, a bold gambit a viewer can respect even while wishing the final project were remotely as grandiose as the auteur‚Äôs aspirations.‚Äù Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post also offered the film a positive review. The film currently holds a critical score of 100% on the movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on six reviews, with an average rating of 7.6 out of 10. Due to good word of mouth among audiences, the film was frequently viewed many times upon its release. According to TorrentFreak, a file sharing news site, Ink was downloaded via BitTorrent 400,000 times in a single week, which exposed the film to a large audience and led to higher DVD and Blu-ray sales in return.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=758767 on 2014-12-10 Taxonomy The genus Margarya was described by Nevill (1877) based on shells of the type species collected by A.R. Margary from Lake Erhai, the type locality of Margarya melanioides. Based on shell and radular morphology, Tchang & Tsi (1949) revised this genus for the first time and recognized seven distinct species. He created two subgenera of Margarya , viz Tchangmargarya and Mabillemargarya. The first molecular phylogeny showed that the genus Margarya is polyphyletic and divided into three distinct clades. Combining study of comparative morphology and molecular phylogeny, Zhang et al. revised the systematics of Margarya and recognized eight genuine extant species. However, only four species were found belonging to Margarya s. str., the rest species belonging to distinct genus Tchangmargarya or Anularya. Distribution This genus appear to be endemic to Dian Lake, Erhai Lake, Cibi Lake, Jianhu Lake, Xihu Lake, and Lugu Lake in Yunnan Province in the China. Species There are 4 extant species and 4 fossil species of Margarya s. str. Margarya bicostata and Margarya mansuyi are transferred to Anularya. Margarya yangtsunghaiensis is transferred to Tchangmargarya.

Margarya as traditionally delimited decayed into three distinct clades.The sister lineages of two of these clades are representatives from different vivparid genera, which are widely distributed in East and Southeast Asian rivers and lakes. These predominantly riparian viviparids also differ markedly in their shell morphology. Herein only genus-level phylogenic relationship is given, whereas relationship between lower taxonomic units deserve further study.

Peter King is perhaps better known in Europe and America than in Nigeria for his \\"Miliki Sound\\" on the record A Soulful Peter King, where he played popular classics such as \\"Sincerely\\", \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Just Because\\". Life Peter King was born in 1938 in Enugu in the Southeastern region of Nigeria and grew up in Lokoja, Lagos, and Port Harcourt. In 1957 he joined the Roy Chicago band in Ibadan, playing the maracas and then the conga drum. He moved to other bands in Ibadan and then Lagos, playing the double bass, drums and then the alto sax. In 1961 he went to London, England] where he studied at various schools of music, including Trinity College of Music. While in London, King joined with drummer Bayo Martins and trumpeter Mike Falana to form the African Messengers group. The group performed at festivals and clubs, and served as backup band for acts like The Four Tops, The Temptations and Diana Ross. The African Messengers recorded many 45rpm records. \\"Highlife Piccadilly\\", a fusion of Highlife and jazz, was a hit. King formed another band The Blues Builders with which he toured Europe and Northern Africa. King returned to Nigeria in 1969, and with his group The Voice of Africa performed on the war front during the Nigerian Civil War. Returning to London in 1971, he toured Europe, America and Japan with his group Shango. He assembled and arranged a big band to back the singing group Boney M on their first live concert tour across Europe in 1977. He recorded nine studio albums between 1975 and 1978, and wrote music for several plays and television shows. In 1979 King returned to Nigeria and formed the P.K band. He composed music for soap operas and recorded three further albums. In the early 1980s Peter King and his P.K. Band played on the NTA and at the National Museum, Lagos, for three years. Music King plays in the Sonny Rollins-Gene Ammons-John Coltrane tradition. He has a unique tone, flawless articulation and a fresh turn of mind in improvisations, and is the leading tenor saxophone voice to have come from the Nigerian highlife and afrobeat traditions. Talking of his hit \\"Highlife Piccadilly\\", King said: \\"Our philosophy was to play modern jazz with highlife as the basis ... Afrojazz is my musical direction and a mission\\". King combined afrobeat with a funk style similar to James Brown. His album Shango was acclaimed by critics. Opening with a simple flute melody, tambourines enter followed by complex duets between horns and looping guitar riffs. School of Music King founded his School of Music in 1982, in a three-room apartment in Maza Maza. At first it had about 30 students, though since then has expanded greatly, and is now located in Badagry. It has lecture halls, rehearsal rooms, an assembly-concert hall and hostel facilities. The school has been assisted by Canadian musicians Oliver Jones and Archie Allen and greatly assisted by the French government. Almost two thousand students have graduated from the school since 1982. The school provides practical tuition and grants certificates and diplomas. It prepares students for the professional examinations of Associate, Licentiate and Fellowship of the Trinity, Royal and London Schools of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

Although she served during the Napoleonic Wars she is known for her role in two events, the claiming of Ascension Island for Great Britain in 1815, and the naming of the Saumarez Reefs in 1823. She was broken up in 1835. Napoleonic Wars and War of 1812 Commander Alexander K. Mackenzie commissioned her and remained her captain until July 1812. During that time she was in the North Sea and visited Portugal at least twice. Zenobia was one of the Royal Navy vessels involved in the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign, which started on 30 July 1809. In August she was part of the light squadron under Sir Edward Owen and participated in the bombardment of Flushing. British forces withdrew in December. On 26 November Zenobia captured the Danish Ship Twee Gebroeders. In early January 1810 Zenobia sent Emanuel, Findrup, master, of Christiana, into Yarmouth. Zenobia also ran down Drie Grebroders, Oomackes, master, off Yarmouth. She had been coming from Riga and was totally lost.Lloyd's List (LL) ‚Ññ4420. On 18 September 1810 she joined in the chase and capture of Alexander, a French ketch privateer of 16 guns (but only four mounted). Alexander was on her first cruise out of Saint-Malo and had captured the schooner Peggy. On 24 October Zenobia sailed for Portugal. Zenobia sailed for Portugal on 24 January 1812, and in July Commander Richard Foley assumed command. The next month Zenobia captured the American ships Cordelia, Salter, master (14 August), Catherine, Allen, master, (17 August) and America, Hilbert, master (24 August). Cordelia, of St. Ubes, arrived in Lisbon on 19 August. Catherine, of St Michaels, arrived there on 23 August. America had been sailing from Baltimore to Lisbon and arrived at Plymouth on 8 September.LL,‚Ññ4701. Cordelia reached Plymouth on 19 September.LL ‚Ññ4704. Catherine arrived at Plymouth on 2 October.LL ‚Ññ4708. The London Gazette report of a grant of two-thirds of the value of the detained vessels states that the detainment took place prior to hostilities. In December, Zenobia detained and sent into Gibraltar George and Albert, Dashiel, master. George and Albert had been sailing from Baltimore to Gibraltar.LL ‚Ññ4738. In late January or early February 1813, Zenobia captured Little James, which was sailing from Lisbon to America. However, the American privateer Paul Jones, of 16 guns and 120 men, recaptured Little James. She was only one of a number of vessels that Paul Jones captured at around this time.LL ‚Ññ4745. However, the gun-brig recaptured James (aka Little James), May, master, and sent her into Gibraltar in February.LL ‚Ññ4761. On 25 June 1813 Zenobia captured the American ship Hindostan. The initial payment of prize money amounted to ¬£5000. Two days later Zenobia captured Isabella. Isabella, Shepheard, master, had been sailing from New Orleans to Cadiz. At about the same time Zenobia detained Hepsa, Bailey, master, which had been sailing from New York to Lisbon, and Isabella, Shepheard, master, which had been sailing from New Orleans to Cadiz.LL ‚Ññ4791. On 3 January 1814 Zenobia captured Wellington. On 7 June Foley received promotion to post-captain and Commander Nicholas Charles Dobree assumed command.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p.389. Under Dobree, Zenobia recaptured William & Alfred on 5 January 1815 and Diana on 3 March. The American privateer Harpy had captured William & Alfred off Cape Finisterre three days before as she was sailing from London to Antigua. Zenobia sent her into Lisbon on 10 January, minus part of the cargo, which Harpy had taken.LL ‚Ññ4942. The privateer James Munro had captured Diana, of Greenock, Ferguson, master. Diana had been sailing from Alicante to Londonderry when James Munro captured her. After Zenobia had recaptured Diana, Zenobia took Diana into Lisbon.LL ‚Ññ4958. Ascension Island Zenobia, under Commander Nicholas Charles Dobree, together with her sister ship Peruvian, under Captain James Kearney White, had been part of the flotilla under Rear Admiral George Cockburn that had taken Napoleon into his final exile at St Helena. Cockburn was concerned that the French might use Ascension Island, uninhabited at the time, to stage a rescue mission. He therefore decided to claim and garrison the island. On 22 October 1815, at 5pm, Zenobia and Peruvian anchored in Clarence Bay. The ships' logs record that at 5.30pm, Dobree and White came ashore, raised the Jack, and took possession of the island in the name of His Britannic Majesty, King George III. Zenobia left shortly thereafter, while Peruvian stayed until Spring. On 8 April 1816 Zenobia arrived in Plymouth and was laid up. Napoleon died on St Helena in 1821 and the Admiralty wanted to withdraw the garrison. However, Sir George Collier, Commodore of the West Africa Squadron, persuaded the Admiralty to retain it as it had become a victualing station for the vessels of the squadron, which was engaged in anti- slavery patrols. It also provided a sanatorium for the squadron's ships and crew. The Admiralty later designated Ascension Island \\"HMS Ascension\\", a \\"Stone sloop of War of the smaller class\\". Saumarez Reefs Satellite view of Saumarez Reefs Lieutenant John Lihou, then Master of Zenobia, was on passage from Manila to South America and had chosen a route through Torres Strait. This was the first occasion a ship had navigated the Torres Strait from west to east. It was also the first occasion a ship traversed the Coral Sea from Torres Strait, south-eastward to the southward of New Caledonia. Lihou saw Sir James Saumarez' Shoal (now Saumarez Reefs) on 27 February 1823, and named the reef system after Vice-Admiral James Saumarez. On this same trip, Lihou discovered the Lihou Reef and Cays and Port Lihou. Zenobia left Sydney, New South Wales, in April. Please note that this information appears to be incorrect and confuses two ships of the same name. The Zenobia captained by John Lihou was a 550-ton merchant vessel built at Calcutta. Port Lihou, on the southern shore of Prince of Wales Island, was originally named by Lihou as Port Yarborough. A description of Lihou's discovery of Port Yarborough is given in James Horsburgh's India Directory, vol. 1, 1841, and a brief account of Lihou's voyage through the Torres Strait, during which he lost four anchors and a rudder, is found in the Sydney Gazette of April 1823. Fate On 6 August 1835 the Navy Office offered Zenobia for sale by Dutch auction for ¬£1600 but had to take her in at ¬£890.Nautical magazine and journal of the Royal Naval Reserve, Volume 3, p.64. Later that month a Mr. Tibbett bought her for ¬£650 for breaking up.

Was the most senior, although not the first, wife of Quibilai Khan (1215-1294)\\"‚Äì1281) was a Khongirad empress consort of the Yuan dynasty in China, married to Kublai Khan. As such, she was the wife to the Mongol Khagan who had conquered all of China in the 1270s. Life According to \\"The Secret History of the Mongols\\", Chabi was the favorite wife of Kublai and a valued unofficial adviser throughout his reign. She was a patron of the arts and may have played a key role in advancing the interests of the young Venetian traveler, Marco Polo. It is said she was Christian, like her mother-in-law, Sorghaghtani, although Sorghaghtani was also said to be the niece of Chinngis Khan. Empress Chabi exemplified the high role of women in Mongol culture. As Kublai's wife and advisor, she knew Kublai very well. She was an important political and diplomatic influence, especially in pleasing the Chinese masses through reconciliation. Chabi promoted Buddhism in the high levels of government. She suggested the better treatment of the north Chinese imperial family in order to appease the people. Chabi also helped Kublai prevent the conversion of Chinese cultivating land into Mongol pastures, out of respect to the Chinese people. Chabi and Kublai's combined cosmopolitan views were effective at adopting Chinese culture without being overwhelmed by it. Chabi converted to Nestorian Christianity under the influence of her mother-in-law, Sorgaghtani Beki and after Chabi's conversion, Nestorianism was fast spread around China . With Chabi's help, Kublai was not able to control his ambitious brother and the potentially unruly Chinese scholar-gentry and peasantry.  Sources  * * Jack Weatherford (2011).

Baucom, Ph.D.(born 22 July 1949) is a clinical psychology faculty member at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. He is recognized for founding the field of Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy. Baucom is also recognized as one of the top marital therapists and most prolific researchers in this field. Currently, Baucom's National Cancer Institute funded study, CanThrive, has the largest observationally coded sample of any couples study to date.  Biography  Baucom lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where he is the Richard Lee Simpson Distinguished Professor of Psychology at UNC. He is a familiar face on campus, having received both his bachelor's degree and his Ph.D. from UNC. Baucom's son Brian is also a Clinical Psychologist. Brian worked in southern California where he received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles. He currently works at the University of Utah.  Research description  Baucom with fellow couples researchers Brian Baucom (center) and Andrew Christensen (right) For over thirty years, Donald H. Baucom has focused his research on the dynamics of intimate relationships and how various factors contribute to distress, as well as joy, in couples. As a strong proponent of the scientist-practitioner model he is committed to the development of empirically based effective interventions for partners in intimate relationships. In doing so, he has been a leader in the development of the theoretical, empirical, and clinical foundation of cognitive-behavioral therapy that is used for helping couples in distress. Baucom has spent his career observing the ways in which couples interact, and how these individual interaction styles can cause both distress and joy in relationships based on factors such as social support, health, and infidelity. Social Support: Baucom has been interested in the ways by which social support styles contribute to both positive and negative functioning during the course of a relationship. Health: Baucom has studied the ways in which physiological/psychological health can become stressors in a dyad that can contribute to distress. For example, he has developed intervention studies based on the effects of anorexia, cancer, smoking, and arthritis with regards to couples functioning. Infidelity: This area is of particular interest to Baucom due to the severity of the direct distress it causes to the relationship. He has collaborated with his colleagues to develop a self-help book for partners experiencing infidelity, and is in the process of creating a training manual to guide practitioners in the aid of couples dealing with infidelity. Obsessive- compulsive disorder: Baucom has collaborated with experts on obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) to develop a couple-based cognitive-behavioral treatment approach for couples in which one partner has this anxiety-related disorder. The treatment involves primarily bringing the non-OCD partner into therapy and training him or her to be a coach to help with exposure and response prevention for the partner with OCD. The couple also learns effective communication strategies and techniques for reducing accommodation and avoidance behaviors together. CanThrive Currently, Baucom is working on a large-scale treatment study funded by the National Cancer Institute called CanThrive. This is a couple-based intervention focused on partnerships in which the female has breast cancer. This study observes and measures various aspects of communicated social support between both partners, and is interested in finding possible relationships between differences in social support and treatment outcomes for breast cancer. This study has the largest observationally coded sample of any couples study to date, and is based at both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. Additionally, he is collaborating with colleagues conducting a similar study in Germany.

October 22, 2011. Archived from the original on December 19, 2011. Retrieved December 19, 2011 Since its founding in 1985, Action Target has increased its inventory to include over 4,000 products. The company designs, delivers, and installs indoor and outdoor range equipment throughout the world. John Mulligan has been Chief Operating Officer since 2015. His predecessor, John Curtis, was a partner in the firm who was elected the mayor of Provo in 2008 and U.S. Representative for Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2016. History Action Target was founded in 1986 by Kyle Bateman and Addison Sovine to address a need they saw with law enforcement training, and operated out of Bateman's bedroom at first. They soon moved to a larger facility near the Interstate 15 freeway in Provo before moving to a manufacturing facility nearby next to a residential neighborhood. In 1989, the company moved to manufacturing facilities on the west side of Provo on property which used to house a wrecking yard. Throughout the next fifteen years, Action Target expanded and built several large buildings to house its manufacturing. In late 2003 or early 2004, the company donated land to Provo City in order to extend the street and provide an alternate route for delivery trucks, as well as offering to purchase properties to create a buffer zone between its facilities and those of residential neighbors. The company produced two bullet-proof training villages for use by the U.S. Army in 2005, a contract worth $3 million. U.S Congressman, Chris Cannon, participated in a demonstration of a similar facility created for use by Utah County police departments, including those from Provo, Brigham Young University, and Orem. In 2007, the city of Provo began consideration of purchasing the property where Action Target was located in west Provo. The property owned by the company in west Provo was approved for purchase by the end of that same year. The city of Provo then approved several bonds in November as incentives for Action Target to move to a new industrial park in the southeast corner of the city. The new industrial business park is the former home of an iron mill closed down in the 1960s. Provo City allowed Action Target to use its tax- exempt status to help secure financing for the costs of moving and building the new facility in the industrial park. The industrial park was part of an infrastructure improvement paid for by a $2 million federal grant. After breaking ground in September 2008, the company began building a new facility which significantly increased its office space and manufacturing capacity. The new building allowed the company to have all their facilities in one location. They began moving into the new facility in August 2009 and officially opened the new facility in November that same year. Projects Action Target has built some of the largest shooting ranges in the world, including the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the range at the FBI Academy, S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec, the United States Secret Service, and the Los Angeles Police Department Training Center. Between 2000 and 2008, the company was awarded $42.9 million in US government contracts. In late 2004, the company completed an 11-building training facility for use in Iraq by the multi-national forces stationed there. The company trains members of law enforcement agencies from around the world, according to its website. Environmental impact Residential neighbors of Action Target's former facilities in west Provo often complained to police and to the city council in 2004 and 2005 about noise, paint fumes, and other pollution, as well as damage caused to fences by delivery trucks and firing of guns for testing. The company has been cited on at least one occasion. Provo City followed up in June 2004 with a list of issues with which the company had to comply. Two local residents photographed employees of Action Target painting outside in September 2005, which they claimed was against the zoning for the area. The residents were members of a neighborhood watch program, and one was later dismissed from the program by the Provo Police. The new facility in southeast Provo is in an industrial business park with no residential areas nearby. Action Target was mentioned in a 2009 USA Today report as emitting the chemical xylene, which has been shown to cause many different negative health effects.

History of Danish Privacy Law Privacy law in Denmark was originally determined by 2 acts: the Private Registers Act of 1978, and the Public Authorities‚Äô Registers Act of 1978, which governed the private sector and the public sector respectively. These 2 acts were replaced by the Act on Processing of Personal Data July 1, 2000, thereby implementing the European Union‚Äôs Data Protection Directive (1995/46/EC). The Danish constitution also mentions privacy, in the form of paragraph 72 that stipulates that the confiscation and examination of letters and other papers; as well the interception of postal-, telegraph- and telephone communication cannot be done without a judicial order.http://www.grundloven.dk (in Danish) September 28, 2006 The declaration of providers of electronic communication networks and electronic communication services registration and storage of information regarding teletraffic (Bekendtg√∏relse om udbydere af elektroniske kommunikationsnets og elektroniske kommunikationstjenesters registrering og opbevaring af oplysninger om teletrafik) was publicised, thereby implementing the European Union‚Äôs Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC), on \\"the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC‚Äù.[347]=x-347-559545 The Main Acts In Danish privacy law, there are several acts that provides the basis for the collecting and storing private data. These are the Act on Processing of Personal Data and the Data Retention Executive Order. Act on Processing of Personal Data The Act on Processing of Personal Data is the main law regarding when and how personal data can be processed, in an electronic system, as well as manual handling of the data, when it is contained in a register. The act applies to all private companies, associations, organisations and to the public authorities. In the private sector, the law also applies to systematic processing of personal data, even if it does not happen electronically.(in Danish) The act differentiates between 3 different kinds of personal data, as they have to be treated differently, depending on the sensitivity of the data: #Sensitive information #Information regarding other purely private conditions #Ordinary non-sensitive information The different kinds of personal data have different requirements for when they can be requested from a citizen, as to avoid that too much unnecessary sensitive data will be given to organisations that does not need them. The act also gives the citizens a series of rights, designed to help give more control of what information is being stored about him or her: #Right to insight into the information, that is being handled about the citizen #Right to be informed that information is being collected about the citizen #Right to have incorrect information deleted or corrected The Data Retention Executive Order The Danish Surveillance law is the ratification of the European Union‚Äôs Directive 2006/24/EC, which requires all providers of communication like telephones and internet to log certain data regarding the communication through their systems.http://logningsdirektivet.dk (in Danish) ¬ß4 of the law require phone companies to log: #The caller‚Äôs phone number (A-number) as well as the name and address of the subscriber or registered user #The called phone number (B-number) as well as the name and address of the subscriber or registered user #The redirected phone number (C-number) as well as the name and address of the subscriber or registered user #The receipt for receiving a message #The identity of the used communications equipment (IMSI- and IMEI-numbers) #The cell or cells a mobile phone was connected to by the communications start and end, and the exact geographical or physical location of the used cell masts used during the time of the communication #The exact time of the start and end of the communication #The time of the first activation of anonymous services (Prepaid mobile phones) ¬ß5 of the law require Internet Service Providers to log the following information about the initiating and the terminating packets: #The senders IP-address #The receivers IP-address #The transport protocol used #The senders port number #The receivers port number #The exact time of the start and end of the communication ¬ß5 section 2 of the law require Providers of Internet access to end users to log the following information about user: #The allocated user identity #The user identity and the phone number that have been allocated communications, which is a part of a public communicationsnetwork #The name and address of the subscriber or registered user, to whom an IP-address, a user identity or a phone number was allocated at the time of the communication #The exact time of the start and end of the communication The European Union‚Äôs Directive 2006/24/EC do not require the member counties to record and store all of these items, but the Danish government decided to expand upon the European directive, to include collection of more data. This led to a drop in Denmark‚Äôs Privacy index of 0.5, from 2.5 to 2.0[347]=x-347-559597 The Data Protection Agency The Data Protection Agency is the central independent authority that makes sure the Act on Processing of Personal Data is obeyed in Denmark. Amongst other things it provides counselling, advice, treat complaints and perform inspections of authorities and companies. It comprises The Data Council and a secretariat. Anyone can complain to The Data Protection Agency if they feel Act on Processing of Personal Data is not obeyed in Denmark, The Agency will then launch a formal investigation into the matter and if required, it can issue fines and/or injunctions. It is possible to appeal the decisions of The Agency to a Danish court of law The Data Council The Data Council is composed of a chairperson and six board members. Its main task is to evaluate and make rulings: #Of a principal nature #Of significant common interest or with significant consequences for a public authority or private company #That due to special circumstances should be decided by the council #That a council member wish to discuss during a council meeting The current chairperson and 6 board members are: *Chairperson, High Court Judge Henrik Waaben #Lawyer Janne Gl√¶sel #Professor, dr. jur.

He then proceeded to upload a video from his shop surveillance camera of the masked robber, and issued a 25,000 DKR (‚Ç¨3,333) reward for any information that would lead to the arrest of the robber. The Data Protection Agency decided to initiate an administrative proceeding against Preben Randl√∏v as he had not ‚Äúasked the robber to consent‚Äù to the uploading of the video, and he was fined by 10,000 DKR (‚Ç¨1,333) by the police, as only the police have the authority to release videos of this nature. The video did lead to an arrest of 2 individuals who claimed they had bought the jewelry, but neither of them were convicted for the robbery. In October 2008, another one of Preben Randl√∏v stores was robbed, and he told reporters during an interview, that he would upload a video of the new robbery as well.(in Danish) The Shell case In March 2009 it was discovered a Shell petrol station had a wall with pictures of petrol thieves in the shop of the petrol station. The Data Protection Agency decided to prosecute them because it was not legal according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data.(in Danish) Privacy Problems in Denmark According to Privacy International‚Äôs study: Leading surveillance societies in the EU and the World 2007, the main concerns in Denmark regarding privacy is the following: * Constitutional right to privacy depends on section 71 on personal liberty and section 72 on search and seizure * Comprehensive privacy law, and exempts security and defence services * Data privacy authority is appointed by the minister of justice, and the ministry is also responsible for the budget * Data privacy authority may enter any premise without a court order to investigate under the privacy law * Extensive interception of communications; and use of bugs on computers to monitor activity and keystrokes; and plans are in place to minimise notification * Police require list of all active mobile phones near the scene of a crime * DNA samples may be required from applicants for residency based on family ties * Implemented retention of communications data well before EU mandate, for one year * Police took the DNA of 300 youth protestors in 2007 * Implementing air travel surveillance program * Parliament is over-keen to implement surveillance programs * Ratified Cybercrime convention These issues have cause Denmark to receive a very low rating on their Privacy index, a 2.0 (Extensive surveillance societies) compared to a 2.5 in 2006 (Systemic failure to uphold safeguards). This places Denmark on a 34th place of the 45 included counties in the study (although United States and United Kingdom are placed on 40th and 43rd place respectively, with scores of 1.5 and 1.4)  References  External links * Datatilsynet * PI * Danmarks Riges Grundlov Category:Danish law Category:Privacy law ","title":"Privacy law in Denmark"},{"id":"24968028","text":"William Forde \\"Bill\\" Thompson is an academic who has worked in Canada and Australia.

He established the orthopaedic and accident service in Sheffield, and later developed the registrar rotation system which has become standard in the United Kingdom. His interest in trauma surgery, which stemmed from working in a highly industrialised area, led to his becoming one of the first surgeons in the United Kingdom to develop rehabilitation for spinal injury patients under the aegis of the Miners' Welfare Commission. He visited the United States and Canada to study paraplegia which was common after coal mining accidents. Paraplegia remained an interest throughout his career, and he campaigned to establish a spinal unit at Lodge Moor Hospital in Fulwood, South Yorkshire.

The original inhabitants of the town are the Gbagyi speaking people. The paramount ruler is the Esu who is otherwise known as Sa-bwaya. However, with the establishment of FCT in Abuja so many changes occurred; such changes include the turbaning of late Musa Ijakoro (of Koro ethnic minority, and from Suleja Emirate where parts of Abuja‚Äôs land was carved out) as District Head of Bwari in 1976, and his elevation as Sarki of Bwari to the position of a second class status in 1997 by the Ministry of the Federal Capital Territory under the then minister, General Jeremiah Useni.

History  Its history dates as far back as the seventeenth century when a Zaria-based hunter came to the area in the company of his family to hunt. Legend has it that at the time there existed a place known as Bwayape, (Bwari Hill) which means ‚Äòpound here‚Äô. He had given his wife some millet. She asked him where she could pound it and he said, ‚Äòpound here‚Äô; thus the origin of the name. Bwaya later metamorphosed into the name Bwari. The four children of the hunter went swimming and were given the task of retrieving a precious object from the depth of the river. It turned out that it was the last of the four who succeeded at the task. But because of his place in the family he could not ascend the throne and his elder brother Tayebebe was crowned instead followed by Dadadogunyi. That object is still a symbol in the turbanning process of the Bwari people.

ART can be used to successfully manage HIV infection, but a number of factors can contribute to the virus mutating and becoming resistant. Drug resistance occurs as bacterial or viral populations evolve to no longer respond to medications that previously worked. In the case of HIV, there have been recognized cases of treatment resistant strains since 1989, with drug resistance being a major contributor to treatment failure. While global incidence varies greatly from region to region, there has been a general increase in overall HIV drug resistance. The two main types of resistance, primary and induced, differ mostly in causation, with the biggest cause of resistance being a lack of adherence to the specific details of treatment. These newly created resistant strains of HIV pose a public health issue as they infect a growing number of people because they are harder to treat, and can be spread to other individuals. For this reason, the reaction to the growing number of cases of resistant HIV strains has mostly been to try to increase access to treatment and implement other measures to make sure people stay in care, as well as to look into the development of a HIV vaccine or cure.HIV drug resistance report 2017. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017. Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO.  Mechanisms of resistance  HIV is considered resistant when it no longer respond to known treatments. Because currently there is no known cure for HIV, the goal of treatment is to reduce an infected individual's viral load to the point where it is no longer detectable in order to alleviate their symptoms and reduce their risk of infecting others. HIV drug resistance poses an issue because it reduces the possible HIV medications a person can take due to cross resistance. In cross resistance, an entire class of medication is considered ineffective in lowering a patient's HIV viral load because all the drugs in a given class share the same mechanism of action.\\"Drug Resistance\\". AIDSinfo. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Retrieved 31 October 2017. Therefore, development of resistance to one medication in a class precludes the use of all other medications in the same class. A blood test can be done to determine which drugs may be effective prior to initiation of treatment or during treatment to ensure resistance has not developed.  Types of resistance  = Induced resistance = One of the two types of HIV drug resistance is induced resistance. Induced resistance refers to resistance that occurs as a result of drug therapy. HIV is a retrovirus that replicates quickly using reverse transcriptase, known for its lack of error correcting mechanisms, resulting in a high mutation rate. Mutations that confer a substantial selective advantage to HIV survival can therefore quickly replicate within an individual, creating a new, resistant strain. These mutations accumulate over generations and in populations, resulting in the great genetic variation within populations of HIV, and an increased probability of a virion developing an evolutionary selective advantage over other virions. Natural selection then acts on HIV by selecting for virions with higher fitness, as all others are eventually killed off by drug treatments. The virions that are able to escape the harmful effects of the drug then create an entirely new, drug resistant population. The selected-for virions continue reproducing until the patient's viral load returns to pre-treatment levels, creating a cycle in which treatment is initially successful in reducing the viral load, but becomes less effective as the virus becomes resistant and virion levels once again increase. = Primary resistance = The other type of HIV drug resistance is primary resistance. Primary resistance refers to resistance that is not incurred as a result of ART therapy. It is thought that some strains of HIV-1 are naturally resistant to ART drugs, and that the prevalence of these strains varies across the globe. Primary resistance is acquired when an individual's initial infection with HIV comes from an already resistant strain. An individual infected by a resistant strain begins their course of treatment with already limited drug options, which can pose problems later down the line if they develop additional resistance.  Causes of resistance  = Importance of drug regimen adherence = As previously described, mutations occur as a result of random mutations that are especially prevalent in HIV due to characteristic elements of the viral reproductive process, namely the use of reverse transcriptase. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified, including mutations that block the incorporation of nucleosides, a class of HIV drug, into the viral DNA. One known cause of HIV drug resistance is lack of adherence to the prescribed drug regiment. Low levels of adherence can be attributed to lack of access to healthcare, stigmatization of HIV, and a lack of availability of drugs due to prohibitive cost or other factors. Missing doses of medication or taking them late poses a major issue because it can allow for the virus to once again begin to replicate inside the body. Proper adherence also greatly reduces the risk of the spread of the virus, thereby improving general public health and lowering health care spending. Some drugs are known to have lower incidences of resistance and may be preferable for individuals known to have difficulty adhering to a drug routine, but these benefits have to be weighed with the potential risks, including severity of side effects. Potential limited effects of current drugs  In 2004, one study estimated the percentage of the American HIV positive population with some form of drug resistance to be 76.3%. A more recent study in South Korea estimated that 50% of their HIV positive population had multi-drug resistant strains of HIV, while 10% had multi-class resistant strains. Multi-class resistant strains pose a larger problem because each class includes many drugs, and eliminating use of an entire class of drugs severely limits treatment options. These studies indicate that the incidence of resistance varies greatly based on geographic location. In their 2017 HIV Drug Resistance Report, the World Health Organization conducted surveys in 14 countries to estimate the prevalence of resistance to HIV medications. One subgroup included only HIV-positive patients who had just initiated antiretroviral therapy in order to assess the prevalence of HIV drug resistance in treatment-naive patients, deemed \\"pretreatment drug resistance.\\" Resistance to NNRTIs in this patient population ranged from 2.7% (in Myanmar) to 15.9% (in Uganda). Resistance to NRTIs ranged from 0.3% (in Namibia) to 6.8% (in Nicaragua). Resistance to protease inhibitors ranged from 0.3% (in Cameroon and Myanmar) to 2.6% (in Mexico). Resistance to NNRTI + NRTI combination therapy ranged from 0.2% (in Myanmar) to 4.6% (in Uganda). Contemporary treatment issues Current medical and scientific opinion is mixed on the most effective treatment methods, but is focused on drug cocktails and the importance of first-line regimens. The World Health Organization advocates a public-health approach to HIV treatment in order to make treatment uniform and available to patients around the world. As of July 2017, the WHO is implementing the Global Action Plan on HIV drug resistance 2017-2021. It is a 5-year initiative intended to help countries around the world manage HIV drug resistance. Among treatment methods, the World Health Organization acknowledges the importance of successful first-line treatments. First-line treatments are known to affect the virus‚Äô future response to other treatments, making the effectiveness of first-line treatments an issue of vital importance. The most successful treatments are combinations of three drugs used simultaneously, as this greatly reduces the probability of the virus developing resistance.  ART use in developing countries  Shortly after the advent of ART therapy, there was much controversy about how to make the drugs accessible to the developing world in countries where the disease was most widespread. Because of the strict regimen that had to be followed in taking the drugs, critics were hesitant to distribute the drugs in under- resourced countries where they worried patients would be unwilling or unable to follow the regimen. However, studies comparing drug regimen adherence rates between high and low income countries showed that individuals in low income countries were no less likely to correctly follow drug instructions. In one study, 77% of African patients were found to satisfy the standard of adherence, compared to just 55% of North American patients studied. These high adherence rates in resource-poor countries can be attributed to the success of community-based approaches like the HIV Equity Initiative in Haiti, which employed local workers and trained them in how to safely distribute HIV medication, as well as programs such as that in Brazil, in which generic drugs are able to be mass produced and distributed for little to no cost.  Future steps to control HIV resistance  The number of people with resistant strains of HIV are growing, making the matter a more pressing issue for health care officials. If current trends continue, infection rates will rise, as will government spending on HIV/AIDS. HIV drug resistance also has the potential to disrupt the progress being made in the global fight against AIDS, such as with the \\"90-90-90\\" target to diagnose 90% of cases, provide treatment to 90% of infected individuals, and successfully suppress the viral load in 90% of the treated individuals. New classes of drugs are constantly being researched and produced to help address the issue of resistance, as well as to try to alleviate the steep costs associated with managing HIV. However, UNAIDS believes that the issue is currently under control, with ART treatment being effective for a majority of patients. Instead, they support research into developing a vaccine or cure as being more central to the mission of reducing the spread of AIDS.

Early life  Nagam Aiya was born in the village of Veeraraghavapuram in the Tirunelveli district of the then Madras Presidency. His ancestors were Telugu Brahmins who migrated to the Tamil country seven generations before him. He moved to Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Travancore state when he was a child and settled there. Nagam Aiya had his early education at Maharajah's High School and College in Thiruvananthapuram. He completed his matriculation in 1865 and his F. A. in 1866 and became the first graduate of Maharajah's College when he graduated in February 1870. Dewan Bahadur / Diwan Bahadur was a title of honor awarded during British Raj.[1][2] It was awarded to individuals who had performed great service to the nation. It was an equivalent of the \\"Civil Division\\" of the British Order of the Bath. The title was accompanied by a medal called a Title Badge. Dewan literally means Prime Minister in Indian context and Bahadur means brave. This title was above Rao Bahadur title and usually people with Rao Bahadur were elevated to status of Dewan Bahadur.[1][3] Further, the Prime Ministers of Indian Princely States were known as Dewan/Diwan. They were also given or promoted directly to the title of Dewan Bahadur by British authorities on being appointed as Dewan, to suit their post.

Nagam Aiya (C.1880) Map of Travancore in 1871 In 1870, Nagam Aiya started his career as a clerk in the English Office, who was appointed by the then Diwan, Sir T. Madhava Rao. In 1872, he was then appointed Tahsildar and rose to become Diwan Peishkar in 1883. In 1875, at the age of 24, Nagam Aiya conducted the first census operations in Travancore. In 1906, Nagam Aiya was deputed to prepare a gazetteer of Travancore stateThe Indian gazetteers - India. Ministry of Education - Google Books in the lines of the district manuals of Madras Presidency. The Travancore State Manual, comprising three volumes, which appeared in 1906, is considered to be Nagam Aiya's greatest work and is still in print.  Major Contributions, shaping modern day Kerala  Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala once referred by the British as Trivandrum, had also been the capital of Travancore. Travancore, Cochin and the Malabar, three major regions of Kerala amalgamated in 1956 to what we now know as \\"Kerala\\". Travancore became the second most prosperous princely state in British India, with reputed achievements in education, political administration, public work and social reforms. The Kingdom of Travancore () (Thiruvithamkoor) was an Indian kingdom from c.870 CE until 1949 CE. It was ruled by the Travancore Royal Family from Padmanabhapuram, and later Thiruvananthapuram. At its zenith, the kingdom covered most of modern-day central and southern Kerala with the Thachudaya Kaimal's enclave of Irinjalakuda Koodalmanikkam temple in the neighbouring Kingdom of Cochin,British Archives http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/d3e53001-d49e-4d4d-bcb2-9f8daaffe2e0 as well as the district of Kanyakumari, now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The official flag of the state was red with a dextrally-coiled silver conch shell (Turbinella pyrum) at its center. In the early 19th century, the kingdom became a princely state of the British Empire.

Nagam Aiya with developing the 'Travancore State Manual' which encompasses various administrative and economic affairs, and resources of the Kingdom, and which follows the model of the district manuals of the Madras presidency, under the English rule. Diwan V. Nagam Aiya mentions that the idea had been ‚Äòbroached‚Äô to him by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier. At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistratein 1901. Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this work. What came out was a books of ‚Äòencyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter- press‚Äô over 3 Volumes, which are in publication even to this day, and available on various sources including Amazon. It might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in his mind, and he must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before he started on this work, however. he started his work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904.  The Travancore State Manual  Diwan V. Nagam Aiya's work in 1906, the Travancore State Manual is a huge volume of history (1820 pages, published over 3 volumes of 648, 592 and 580 pages respectively) not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place. The works along with history also contains detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the Travancore State at the time. The manuals includes details such as the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes, rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees, and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, ‚ÄòArchaeology‚Äô, ‚ÄòFauna‚Äô, census and population, language, economic condition and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound. There are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom. The latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom. The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend. This legend is also mentioned in great detail. Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals. Mentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out. Sections on history deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy. There are other details on items such as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings and kingdoms north of Travancore, small- time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc. Velu Thampi Dalawa‚Äôs rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find his cause correct or praiseworthy. The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations. QUOTE: Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was his forte. END of QUOTE. QUOTE: His favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. END of QUOTE. All rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal‚Äôs (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.  His Goals  Diwan V. Nagam Aiya admitted in his works that his goal was to cover an expansive amount of information pertaining to the Kingdom, in ways that had never been undertaken in the past. He wrote \\"In the writing of this book, my aim has been to present to an utter stranger to Travancore, such a picture of the land and its people, its natural peculiarities, its origin, history and administration, its forests and animals, its conveniences for residence or travel, its agricultural, commercial, industrial, educational and economic activities, its ethnological, social and religious features in ways he may not himself be able to form or learn over a 30 years study or residence in it. If this is a correct view of the objective of a manual, I trust that I may be permitted to entertain the hope that a fairly successful debut has been made, notwithstanding defects or shortcomings that may exist, especially as this is only a pioneer attempt in a novel direction\\".  Availability of the works  The print version of Travancore State Manual is available.

So, in 1910 the engineer and architect Arturo Prins created the project, but the engineers and architects Correa and Cornejo continued with the construction. The building was built on a plot of land belonging to the Jesuit Church. It was finally inaugurated in 1913. The access to this building was limited to a very select sector of the society of Salta, and the partners of this association had to pay $1500 per share, for its construction. In 1950 until 1987 the building was expropriated for use as the Government House of the Province. Since then, the luxurious building has been used for cultural activities under the name of America Cultural Center. Since it had only a cultural use, every sector of the society had free access to these valuable areas. Its restoration began in 1987 under the Department of Architectural Heritage and Preservation of Salta (better known as DePAUS). Contributors for the financing of such activity were members of the community and the Government of the Province. The building is a part of the Monumental Complex of the Plaza 9 de Julio and represents the most valuable facade on Mitre Street. It identifies the civil-religious power, and also has a great social-cultural meaning. This masterpiece is one of the first built with the style of Neo-Renaissance, with the objective of maintaining the style of the Cabildo, very trendy in big cities in the early twentieth century. It consists of a basement, a ground floor and first floor. It is organized around a central space with imperial staircase, illuminated by vertical and overhead windows, which together with the carpentry side express a theatrical management of the space. The facade, with plaster of Paris simile stones, occurs in three levels with arcades of Renaissance proportions. It has a balcony on the first floor. It also contains lunettes and stained glass, basketry, which crowns the attic, vases and lamps that add delicate details to the whole building. It presents sober ornamental details in walls and ceilings, the floor is decorated with venetian mosaics and oak parquet from Slovenia. All the woodwork is made of oak. Its infra structure consist of hidden shapes of iron, that were imported from England. This building has mezzanines of ceramic flooring blocks, it also has brick walls, and the columns have plinths of marble from Botticino pilasters, the cornices, moldings and plaster sconces are made with vegetable fibers from the area (chaguar) The original functions were: fencing room, locker rooms, confectionery, hairdressing and services in the basement; there were a hall, a bar, a library, a billiard room and lounge on the ground floor. On the first floor there were a ballroom, meeting rooms, halls and offices. But today, it's only used as a convention center and events are performed.

Before her move to the United States in 2004, Borrego was a member of the Jamaica national netball team at the 2003 World Netball Championships in Kingston, where she was the second most prolific shooter of the tournament. Her studies in the United States prevented her from playing for Jamaica in the 2007 World Netball Championships, but she played domestic netball for the Waulgrovians. In 2010, Borrego made herself available for selection in the Jamaica national team but later withdrew. Australian career Borrego played for the Adelaide Thunderbirds in the Australasian ANZ Championship. In 2011, in the fifth round against the Queensland Firebirds, Borrego played at the Goal Keeper position for the very first time. She played at that position again in round 11 against the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic. After the ANZ Championship, Borrego was invited to the Australian National Netball Team's selection camp as a training partner, but was ineligible to be in the Diamond's squad. As a result, Borrego did not compete in the 2011 World Netball Championship for Australia. In 2015, Borrego became an Australian citizen, making her eligible for future selection to the Australian national team.

The band was named after Tahuna Street where they had their first jam. Their musical style incorporated elements of reggae, soul and electro funk music. Origins Tahuna Breaks began as an instrumental band in 2005. The idea originated at Deschlers Bar on Auckland‚Äôs High Street when some of its members-to-be were watching a funk band perform. The original line-up consisted of Marty Greentree (guitar/bass), Tim Gemmell (drums), Jimi Winkle (bass/guitar) and Kelsey Serjeant (tenor sax). The band began gigging at a local bar playing four or five original songs, and improvised further songs when the bar manager requested they play longer for their fee. Marty Greentree came up with a new song idea with lyrics and, after its first performance, friends in the crowd suggested that the band should incorporate more of Greentree's singing as opposed to pure instrumentals. The band demoed three songs with the Rock Factory in 2005, one of which, 'Crisis Situation', received airplay via Jason Kerrison‚Äôs show on Kiwi FM. Albums, personnel, tours The band continued to write songs in a storage shed in Auckland during 2006 and recorded their first album with Andrew Buckton at Studio 203. ‚ÄòReflections‚Äô https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=265159826# contained a range of styles from funk, rock, soul, dub to drum and bass. In order to play the songs on the album live, the band recruited Tim Baker on keyboards and Tom Charleson on guitar. The band commenced its first national tour during 2007 and continued experimenting with its live sound. Before the recording of its second album, the band had grown to eight members with the addition of Jonny McClean on alto sax/percussion and Adam Fuhr on keyboards. The band's second album ‚ÄòBlack, Brown & White‚Äô https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=265159826# was recorded with Lee Prebble at The Surgery in Wellington in late 2008. It utilised the skills of the new members to create a bigger sound. Greentree drew on a wide range of experiences in writing the lyrics to the songs, including his upbringing in a Mormon family, experiences in the New Zealand Police, his renowned reputation for partying and his family life as the father of three children. ‚ÄòBlack, Brown & White‚Äô was released in 2009. Controversy arose when the animated music video for the second single from the album, ‚ÄòGiddy Up‚Äô, was released: directed and illustrated by Leah Morgan and produced by Fish N Clips, the video featured a highly stylised sperm as the pinball in a whimsically sexual pinball machine.

The mausoleum is the tomb where the Berber King Juba II and The Queen Cleopatra Selene II, sovereigns of Numidia and Mauretania, were allegedly buried. However, their human remains have not been found at the site, perhaps due to tomb raiding. History The sepulchre is sometimes known as the Mausoleum of Juba and Cleopatra Selene. In French, it is called the Tombeau de la Chr√©tienne (\\"the tomb of the Christian woman\\") because there is a Christian cross-like shape of the division lines on the false door. In Arabic, the mausoleum is called the Kubr-er-Rumia or Kbor er Roumia, which means \\"tomb of the Christian woman\\", as R√ªm was taken in Arabic as the Eastern Roman Empire and, in North Africa, rumi took the meaning \\"Christian\\". It may have been a deformation of a Punic phrase for \\"the royal tomb\\". Royal Family of Mauretania The mausoleum was built in 3 BC by the last King of Numidia, and later King of Mauretania, Juba II, and his wife Cleopatra Selene II, She was an Egyptian-Greek Ptolemaic princess, the daughter of the Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. Through her marriage to Juba II, she became the last Queen of Numidia and later Queen of Mauretania. The mausoleum is probably the Royal Tomb that the 1st-century Roman geographer Pomponius Mela (1.31) described as the monumentum commune regiae gentis (\\"the communal mausoleum of the royal family\\"). If the geographer‚Äôs description of the mausoleum is correct, then the building was not intended just for Juba and Cleopatra, but envisaged as a dynastic funeral monument for their royal descendants. The Mauretanian sepulchre looks similar to the Mausoleum of Augustus erected by the first Roman Emperor Augustus in Ancient Rome. Augustus began constructing his mausoleum between 29 BC-27 BC, some time before Juba II left Rome to return to Numidia. Construction The Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a common type of ancient mausoleums found in Numidia. It is built on a hill some 250 metres (756 feet) above sea level. The monument is entirely built from stone, while its main structure is in a circular form with a square base topped by a cone or a pyramid. The square base measures 60 to 60.9 metres square or 200 to 209 foot. The height of the monument was originally about 40 metres or 130‚Äô in height. Due to damage that the mausoleum has suffered from natural elements and vandalism, the monument now measures 30-32.4 metres in height. The base of the monument was decorated with 60 Ionic columns whose capitals were removed, possibly stolen. Inside, the centre of the mausoleum has two vaulted chambers, separated by a short passage connected by a gallery outside by stone doors which can be moved up and down by levers. The passage leading to the chambers is about 500‚Äô. One chamber measures 142 feet long by 11 feet broad and is 11 feet high, while the other is smaller. Under the Ottomans and French 1856 photo by John Beasley Greene In the 16th century, the mausoleum was believed by some Spaniards to be the tomb of Florinda la Cava, the legendary Spanish woman, whose rape led to the Islamic conquest of Iberia. It has been explained as a confusion of Qabr Arrumiyya (\\"Christian tomb\\", locally qb√©r √©rromiya) and q√†hba romiya (\\"Christian whore\\"). In 1555, the Pasha of Algiers, Salah Rais, gave orders to pull down the mausoleum. After large black wasps swarmed out and stung some of the workers to death, the effort was abandoned. At the end of the 18th century, Baba Mahommed tried in vain to destroy the monument with artillery. Later, when the French occupied Algeria the monument was used by the French Navy for target practice. Recognition and conservation of the Mausoleum The human remains of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene have not been found at the site. This perhaps due to a grave robbery that occurred at an uncertain time (possibly shortly after the Mausoleum's construction). It is also possible that the structure was simply meant to serve as a memorial and not an actual place of burial.Davies, Ethel (2009). North Africa: the Roman Coast. Chalfont St. Peter, Buckinghamshire: Bradt Travel Guides. , p. 11. The Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a part of a unique archeological site along the road from Cherchell to Tipaza. On this archeological site, there are various monuments and infrastructure that have survived from the Phoenician (see also Carthage National Museum), Roman, Early Christianity and Byzantine periods. This group of ruins that are located along the Mediterranean Sea were recognized and inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. Although these archaeological remains, including the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, are protected, the ruins located between Cherchell and Tipaza face constant threats from continual urban construction and expansion, open sewage drainage run offs, poor maintenance, and constant vandalism. Due to these ongoing problems, these archaeological remains face an uncertain future. The local authorities have failed and had problems implementing a 1992 ‚ÄòPermanent Safeguarding and Presentation Plan‚Äô an effective management program in preserving these ruins. In 2001, the World Heritage Site provided emergency assistance for this archaeological site. In 2002, experts from UNESCO went to visit the site and to report on the condition of the ruins; the archeological site has been placed on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger.

His family later moved to Denver, where he graduated from East High School. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Denver in 1935, and a PhD in chemical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1940. He married Laura Davadell Scobey in 1940. Career L√∂f became interested in solar energy at MIT, where he worked under Hoyt C. Hottel and analyzed data from MIT Solar House I. In 1943, L√∂f designed an early flat-plate solar heating unit and installed it on the roof of his house in Boulder, Colorado. It was called the \\"first solar-heated home\\" in the United States. In 1957, he built a house in the Cherry Hills neighborhood of Denver which used a novel method to collect and store solar heat. It was designed by architect James M. Hunter, and L√∂f designed a flat-plate collection system which heated air and circulated the heat to be stored in rock beds in large cardboard tubes inside the house. L√∂f published several technical papers describing the house and its performance. It cost $40,000 excluding the cost of the heating equipment, which was financed by the American Window Glass Company. L√∂f lived in the house for more than 50 years until his death. In 1974, he oversaw the construction of a research home that was the world's first to also be cooled by solar energy. L√∂f taught chemical engineering at the University of Colorado and the University of Denver before serving on the faculty of Colorado State University in the civil engineering department from 1967 - 1987. He founded the university's Solar Energy Applications Laboratory in 1972. From 1973 - 1975, he was the president of the International Solar Energy Society.

It is one of the leading contributions to historical analysis of the causes of World War I, and along with this work War of Illusions (Krieg der Illusionen) gave rise to the \\"Fischer Thesis\\" on the causes of the war. The title translates as \\"Grab for World Power\\".Trachtenberg, Marc, History and strategy, 1st ed, Princeton University Press, , p49 or \\"Bid for World Power\\". Essentially Fischer attempts to link together a continuum of German belligerence in their \\"grab for power\\" weaving it all together into a cohesive theme of German Weltpolitik.Weltpolitik appeared previous to the First World War, shortly following unification and industrialization. It was employed by various groups and its true meaning has never be explicated at length or solely defined by anyone. Taken literally, the term Weltpolitik translates to ‚Äòworld politic‚Äù or ‚Äòworld policy.‚Äô In this regard, it signified German foreign policy on the global stage. Often quoted by historians, Weltpolitik generally refers to German diplomatic efforts starting around 1890 up until the First World War, which were characterized by German political assertiveness and aggression. More accurately perhaps, Weltpolitik encompassed the outward expansion and securing of German industrial markets for which colonialism/imperialism were a part. It is frequently attributed to Admiral Tipitz‚Äôs naval policies, subsumed of course by the naval war race. For more on the manifestation and implementation of the term Weltpolitik during the years 1890 through 1902, see: Konrad Canis, Von Bismarck zur Weltpolitik: Deutsche Aussenpolitik 1890 bis 1902 (Oldenbourg: Akademie Verlag, 1997). Publication Griff nach der Weltmacht was published in October 1961. It was published in Britain under the title Germany's Aims in the First World War in 1967, translated by C.A. Macartney with an introduction by James Joll. The book included a memorandum by the then German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg dated 9 September 1914 which set out a plan for Germany to dominate Europe.Hayes, Paul, Themes in modern European history, 1890-1945, p115 Controversy Fischer argued that Germany had a policy of deliberately provoking war during July 1914 and that during the war Germany developed a set of annexationist war aims similar to those of Adolf Hitler during the Second World War.Stibbe, Matthew, The Fischer Constrovery over German War aims in the First World War and its reception by East German Historians 1961-1989, The Historical Journal, 46, 3 (2003), pp. 649‚Äì668 On publication, the book caused controversy in West Germany as it challenged the view that Hitler was an aberration by emphasising the continuity in German foreign policy in 1914 and 1939. The book was also controversial for challenging the established view that Germany did not bear the primary responsibility for outbreak of the war, the so-called \\"war guilt lie\\". Fischer also claimed that German elites had wanted war since as early as 1912, with the victory of the SPD in the Reichstag. Academic reaction The historian John Moses stated in his 1975 work The Politics of Illusion that \\"No serious German historian today can venture to pit himself against the evidence compiled by the Fischer school.\\"Moses, John, The Politics of Illusion, (London, 1975) p127 Fischer inspired several disciples, including the historian Imanuel Geiss. However, Fischer was ridiculed by conservative German historians who created a backlash against his ideas. The most notable critic was conservative historian and patriot Gerhard Ritter, who is said to have broken down in tears when lecturing on Fischer's line of argument in Griff nach der Weltmacht. Fischer's ideas were welcomed in the communist dictatorship of East Germany; the Marxist historian and Stasi informer Fritz Klein considered Fischer's views to be uncontroversial.Joll James, Martel, Gordon, The Origins of the First World War, Longman, 3rd ed, p6 Mombauer argues that Fischer's work led to greater discussion of the Holocaust by German history professors.Annika Mombauer, The origins of the First World War: controversies and consensus (London, 2002), p. 129. A number of German and British historians find the assertions of Fischer a glaring oversimplification of how the First World War developed, arguing that is decidedly disingenuous given the complexity of the situation as a whole - especially since parts of the evidence for German war aims (i.e. belligerence) from before the Great War were collected amid the fringe writings of Pan-Germans or were parceled together from Kaiser Wilhelm's rantings; none of which constituted official state policy. Stephen A. Schuker, writing in 2015, notes that although Fischer's book aroused great controversy when it was published, \\"Fischer's work made its way. Refinements by Immanuel Geiss, John R√∂hl, Holger Afflerbach, Annika Mombauer, and others have confirmed the essentials\\".Stephen A.

The battle is documented in detail in the ancient chronicles of the country. However, they only provide the viewpoint of Dutthagamani and his army, and details are scarce on Elara's side. After launching a campaign to regain the country from Elara, Dutthagamani captured a number of his strongholds before coming to the fortified city of Vijithapura. A four-month siege ensued, followed by a large assault where Dutthagamani's champions and royal elephant played a major part. The chronicles focus a lot on these ten champions, and vividly describe some unusual \\"tests\\" that Dutthagamani carried out to find out their skills. The battle ended in victory for Dutthagamani's forces and considerably weakened Elara's army, ultimately leading to his defeat and death. The exact location of Vijithapura is unknown, though historians have made some speculations on this. The battle is still regarded by Sri Lankans as a legendary event in the country's history, and has even been compared with victories of the Sri Lanka Army during the country's civil war.  Records  Dutthagamani's campaign against Elara is given in detail in the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka; Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa, Rajavaliya and Thupavamsa. All of them describe the battle in detail, and apply a high importance to it. Dutthagamani is a hero in these chronicles, and his campaign is depicted as a \\"holy war\\" aimed at restoring Buddhism in the country. Therefore, these accounts are favourably biased to him, and the description of the Battle of Vijithapura, along with the rest of the campaign, is a mix of fact and legend. However, historians agree that the basic facts from these chronicles are accurate. The one sided accounts given in the chronicles mean that there is very little information to be obtained on Elara and his armies. According to Orientalist Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the Mahavamsa, the problem is \\"not what is said but what is left unsaid\\".Siriweera (2004), p. 31  Background  At the time of the battle, Ellalan was the king of Anuradhapura. He was a Chola prince from South India, who had defeated the Sinhalese ruler Asela in an invasion. Although an invader, Elara is described as a just ruler who had even patronized Buddhism.Siriweera (2004), p. 33 Most of the country came under this Tamil king's rule, while his rival Kavan Tissa, a Sinhalese king from Ruhunu in the south of the country, organized a resistance against him. Kavan Tissa's son, Dutthagamani, ascended to the throne after the death of his father.Siriweera (2004), p. 30 Soon after he became the king in Ruhuna, Dutthagamani launched a campaign against Elara with the intention of \\"restoring and glorifying Buddhism\\" in the country.Wijesooriya (2006), p. 58 After setting out from Magama and crossing the Mahaweli river, Dutthagamani captured a number of forts and cities that were under Elara, and killed several of his generals.Abesekara (1998), p. 31 The ancient chronicles refer to all of the chieftains or generals defeated by Dutthagamani as Demalas (Tamils). However, it is unlikely that all of them were indeed Tamils, and it is possible that one of them--whose name is given as Dighabaya--may even have been a stepbrother of Dutthagamani himself who had later joined Elara.Siriweera (2004), p. 32  Vijithapura  After these victories, Dutthagamani's army marched on to the \\"great fortress of Vijithapura\\". Dutthagamani followed a road between Sigiriya and Minneriya to take his army there; a road that had been used by Pandukabhaya, a previous ruler, in his military campaigns as well.Geiger (1994), p. 291 The city of Vijithapura, which the Mahavamsa refers to as Vijitha Nagara, had been founded nearly three hundred years ago by the brother in law of king Panduvasudeva.Wright (1999), p. 24 By the time of the battle, it had become a well-fortified stronghold of Elara. It is said to have been surrounded by three moats and a wall with a height of 18 cubits.Moratuwagama (1996), p. 227 The wall had four wrought iron gates on the north, south, east and west. The Rajavaliya describes Vijithapura as a fortress second only to Anuradhapura.Senaveratna (1997) p. 125 The control of Vijithapura was essential to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura.Senaveratna (1997) p. 124  Siege  Surviving troops of Elara's forces from previous battles retreated to Vijithapura, further strengthening its defenses.Moratuwagama (1996), p. 226 Dutthagamani's army also arrived and pitched camp close to the fortress. The open stretch of land where they camped later came to be known as Khandavara Pitthi or Kandavurupitiya. They carried out regular assaults against the fortress while the defenders also made occasional sorties, but none of them were able to sway the battle in favour of either side. After laying siege on the city for four months, plans were laid to launch an assault using the entire army. Dutthagamani's army was led by his ten champions or generals, known as the \\"Ten Giant Warriors\\", who were to play a significant part in the battle to come.Senaveratna (1997) p. 126  Testing the warriors  Dutthagamani's flag. The ancient chronicles mention two tests that Dutthagamani planned to find out these warriors' skill before the battle. For the first test, Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large cauldron of toddy, intending to test their strength. When all others refused, Suranimala stepped forward and drank the entire cauldron without any effort.Abesekara (1998), p. 32 The second test was to test Nandimithra, the commander of the army. Dutthagamani had his royal elephant, Kandula, infuriated and set on Nandimithra. However, the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks, pushed it to the ground.Abesekara (1998), p. 33 Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors, Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags, started the assault to take Vijithapura.  Final assault  Dutthagamani's army attacked all four gates of the city simultaneously. He led the main assault on the southern gate with Nandimithra, Suranimala and the elephant Kandula, while the attacks on the northern and western gates were led by Bharana, Khanjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha. The eastern gate was attacked by Mahasona, Gothaimbara, Theraputthabhaya and Velusumana. The defenders of the eastern gates were routed by Velusumana after a cavalry attack, and Elara's forces withdrew into the city. Elara's archers, shooting from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers on top of the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by pouring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city.Moratuwagama (1996), p. 228 Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura.Abesekara (1998), p. 36 The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.Senaveratna (1997) p. 129  Aftermath  The capture of Vijithapura paved the way for Dutthagamani's army to advance on to Anuradhapura, and they proceeded immediately afterwards, capturing two more of Elara's strongholds on the way.Moratuwagama (1996), p. 229 In the battle for Anuradhapura, Dutthagamani killed Elara in single combat and became the king of Anuradhapura, bringing the entire country under his rule.  Modern culture and studies  Kadu Ga Gala, Anuradhapura: The stone which may have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords The battle of Vijithapura is a legendary battle in Sri Lankan history and a significant milestone in Dutthagamani's campaign to restore Buddhism in the country. It is often referred to as Vijithapura maha satana (the great battle of Vijithapura). After the ending of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009, General Sarath Fonseka, the then commander of the Sri Lanka Army, compared several battles they fought to that of Vijithapura. The exact location of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain. A village with the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir may have been the place where the battle took place. There is an ancient temple here as well as a granite stone that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords However, other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.Siriweera (2004), p. 107  References   Citations   Sources   Vijithapura Vijithapura Vijithapura Vijithapura Category:162 BC Category:161 BC ","title":"Battle of Vijithapura"},{"id":"24968388","text":"Major General Sir William Godwin Michelmore, (14 March 1894 ‚Äì 25 October 1982) was a senior British Army officer who served in both world wars and was later aide-de-camp to King George VI and Lord Mayor of Exeter.

After resisting threats to his authority, he fell under suspicion of treason by Selim and was removed as governor in 1522. Governor of Dulkadir Ali Bey, nephew of the Emirate of Dulkadir bey Ala√ºddevle Bozkurt, enters into the pages of history in 1515, after the former Emirate of Dulkadir was taken from the Mamluks by the Ottoman Empire. After the victory, Ali Bey was appointed governor of the now province by the Ottoman sultan Selim I, and Ala√ºddevle's head was delivered to the city of Cairo. In early 1520, Shah Ismail of Persia gave tacit approval to an uprising in Anatolia by the Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ü, a Shi'a militant group. Known as the ≈ûah Veli uprising because of the involvement of a Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ü leader in Ottoman province of Sivas named ≈ûah Veli, it soon became so problematic to Anatolia that the governor of Sivas wrote to Selim for help. The Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ü had many members within its ranks that were associated with the former Dulkadirid rulers who opposed Ali Bey. After two successive defeats at the hands of the Ottoman army, ≈ûah Veli was brought to Ali Bey and dismembered for all to see. This execution was meant to warn anyone who threatened Ali Bey that support for the Kƒ±zƒ±lba≈ü was not to be tolerated under any circumstances.Finkel, p. 113. In 1522, he was removed as governor by Selim I after being accused of treason.

After its closure, the base was reopened as Central Nebraska Regional Airport. History Grand Island Army Airfield was opened in 1942, and was one of eleven USAAF training bases in Nebraska during World War II. A portion of the site was a former national defense airport. The site is bordered on all sides by farm ground. The Army Airfield was constructed, in part, over the pre-existing Grand Island Arrasmith Airport. To convert the existing airport into a military airfield, 173 buildings and structures were constructed at Grand Island Army Airfield. The airfield was activated on 1 April 1943, under the command of Second Air Force Headquarters, Colorado Springs Army Air Base, Colorado. It was used in the early part of the war to train bomber air crews. Later in the war, the field was a staging area for bomber crews preparing for assignments in Guam and Tinian in the Pacific Theater of Operations. It was also a Strategic Air Command base in 1946. Major engine and airframe repair facilities were available for B-17 Flying Fortress and B-29 Superfortress bombers. One bombardment training wing (Second Air Force), and three bombardment groups (Twentieth Air Force) were attached to Grand Island during the war. The 242nd (Operational Training Unit, Very Heavy) of the 17th Bombardment Training Wing commanded the support elements at Grand Island AAF as part of Air Technical Service Command. Known B-29 Superfortress units that trained at Grand Island AAF were: * 6th Bombardment Group (18 May - 19 November 1944) : 24th, 39th and 40th Bombardment Squadrons :Deployed to Twentieth Air Force, Tinian * 502d Bombardment Group (26 September 1944 ‚Äì 7 April 1945) : 402nd, 411th, and 430th Bombardment Squadrons :Deployed to Twentieth Air Force, Guam * 376th Bombardment Group (25 June - 10 November 1945) : 512th, 513th, 514th, and 515th Bombardment Squadrons : Inactivated 10 November 1945 * 449th Bombardment Group (8 September 1945 ‚Äì 4 August 1946) : 716th, 717th, 718th, and 719th Bombardment Squadrons : Assigned to Strategic Air Command at Grand Island AAF : Inactivated 4 August 1946 * 28th Bombardment Group (4 August 1946 ‚Äì 6 October 1946) : 77th, 717th, and 718th Bombardment Squadrons : Assigned personnel and equipment from inactivated 449th Bombardment Group, reassigned to Elmendorf AAF Alaska. With the departure of the B-29 units the USAAF closed Grand Island Army Airfield on 31 October 1946. The facility was turned over to the City of Grand Island for use as a municipal airport and industrial park. However the military use of the base did not end entirely. During the 1960s, Grand Island Regional Airport was utilized by Convair F-102 Delta Darts of the 328th Fighter Wing, 326th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Air Defense) of Air Defense Command as a dispersal base. These aircraft were deployed from Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base outside of Kansas City, Missouri. These dispersal flights ended in 1968. Today, about a dozen military buildings still exist at Central Nebraska Regional Airport including several aircraft hangars, some former warehouses being used for commercial storage and several sheds along with the old parachute building.

Biography Wolfe received a bachelor's degree in Geography from the University of London, UK (1953‚Äì56), a master's degree in Geography from the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario (1956‚Äì59), and a master's degree in Urban Planning from McGill University in Montr√©al (1959‚Äì61). Following her graduation from McGill, Wolfe practiced for over a decade as a professional planner, holding positions with both the City of Montreal and the Quebec Government's Ministry of Municipal Affairs. In 1973, Wolfe joined the faculty of the McGill School of Urban Planning. While at McGill, she developed courses in the history, theory and practice of urban planning, taught numerous planning studio courses (interdisciplinary, team- based practical planning projects) in collaboration with public and community partners, and supervised countless graduate students. Wolfe was Director of the McGill School of Urban Planning between 1988 and 1999, and given the honorific title of Professor Emerita following her retirement. Wolfe was a prolific and accomplished researcher and writer. Among her achievements are reviews about Canadian planning and housing policy, and articles documenting the evolution of Montreal's governance structure. She also extensively studied urban and social issues in developing countries and late in her life, she worked on a history of utopian communities across Canada. In addition to her research, Wolfe participated in many social and environmental organizations and commissions, both locally and nationally. For example, she was a commissioner for both the 1986 Parizeau Commission on the Future of Municipalities and the 1987 commission for the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Montr√©al. She was also a long-serving board member for the Society to Overcome Pollution (1979 to 2009). For the last 25 years of her life, Wolfe was deeply involved in planning research and practice in developing countries, particularly in the Caribbean basin and in Central America. She was a founding member of the Groupe interuniversitaire de Montr√©al, a Centre of Excellence of the Canadian International Development Agency, which helped to establish post- secondary urban-planning programs in local universities and to develop their research capacity. In recent years, she worked in China and in India, studying and advising on local planning and governance structures, for instance with respect to solid-waste management (in India) and metropolitan governance (in China). Wolfe was appointed a member of the Order of Canada in May 2009 for \\"her contributions as a leading scholar and mentor in the field of urban planning in Canada and abroad.\\" Honours * Professor Emeritus in Urban Planning at McGill University (2000) * Prix Jean-Claude La Haye, Ordre des urbanistes du Qu√©bec (2004) * President's Award, Canadian Institute of Planners (2007) * Member of the Order of Canada (2009) See also * Distinguished Canadian Planners References Category:1934 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Canadian urban planners Category:Women urban planners Category:Members of the Order of Canada ","title":"Jeanne Wolfe"},{"id":"24968527","text":"Illustration by Almend√°riz of a stucco relief at Palenque.

In particular, the virus is found in birds as well as mammals including horses, pigs, and humans. The phylogeny, or the evolutionary history of a particular species, is an important component when analyzing the evolution of influenza. Phylogenetic trees are graphical models of the relationships between various species. They can be used to trace the virus back to particular species and show how organisms that look so different may be so closely related. Mechanisms of evolution Two common mechanisms by which viruses evolve are reassortment and genetic drift. Reassortment Reassortment, also known as antigenic shift, allows new viruses to evolve under both natural conditions and in artificial cultures. Reassortment occurs in similar fashion as chromosome crossover events, as two different viral strains may come in contact and transfer some of their genetic information. This crossing-over event creates a mixture of the two viral strains, which may replicate as one hybrid virus that expresses traits from both original viruses. The mechanism of the evolutionary force of antigenic shift allows influenza viruses to exchange genes with strains that infect different species. Under this mechanism, a human influenza virus could exchange genes with an avian strain, and that is how pandemic strains arise. There have been three occurrences of pandemics caused by antigenic shift since 1900, and it could just as easily happen again. In fact, the 1957 evolution of the H2N2 virus is thought to be a result of reassortment. In this case, human H1N1 strains and avian influenza A genes were mixed. Infecting tissue cultures can demonstrate how pathogenic qualities can evolve for a particular species even though the reassorted virus may be nonpathogenic for another species. A prime example of evolution under natural conditions is the reassortment of two avian influenza strains that were discovered in dead seals back in 1979. Drift New viruses can also emerge by drift. Drift can refer to genetic drift or antigenic drift. Mutation and selection for the most advantageous variation of the virus takes place during this form of evolution. Antigenic mutants can evolve quickly due to the high mutation rate in viruses. The cause of the antigenic drift lies in the mechanisms of RNA synthesis itself. Mutations arise very easily simply due to the error prone RNA polymerase and its lack of proofreading mechanisms. These mutations lead to subtle changes in the HA and NA genes which completely changes the infectious capabilities of the virus. These changes allow for almost endless possibilities for new viral strains to arise and it is the antigenic drift of the HA and NA genes that allow for the virus to infect humans that receive vaccines for other strains of the virus. This evolution occurs under the pressure of antibodies or immune system responses. Transmission Species and barriers The transmission, or how the influenza virus is passed from one species to another, varies. There are barriers that prevent the flow of the virus between some species ranging from high to low transmission. For example, there is no direct pathway between humans and birds. Pigs however, serve as an open pathway. There is a limited barrier for them to spread the virus. Therefore, pigs act as a donator of the virus relatively easily. Geographic differences Phylogenetic maps are a graphical representation of the geographic relationships among species. They indicate that the human influenza virus is minimally impacted by geographic differences. However, both swine and avian influenza does appear to be geographically dependent. All three groups (avian, swine, and human) show chronological differences. The human influenza virus is retained in humans only, meaning it does not spread to other species. Some lineages and sublineages of the virus emerge and may be more prevalent in certain locations. For instance, many human influenza outbreaks begin in Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis can help determine past viruses and their patterns as well as determining a common ancestor of the virus. Past studies reveal that an avian virus spread to pigs and then to humans approximately 100 years ago. This resulted in human lineages further evolving and becoming more prominent and stable. Analysis can also feature relationships between species. The 1918 Spanish influenza virus demonstrates this. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the 1918 pandemic virus was closer in sequence to avian strains than other mammalian ones. Despite this genetic similarity, it is obviously a mammalian virus. The gene may have been adapting in humans even prior to 1918. Breaking down the phylogenetic history of the influenza virus shows that there is a common ancestor that reaches back before the 1918 outbreak that links the current human virus to the swine virus. The ancestor was derived from an avian host. Future impact and prediction strategies Phylogenetics Looking at the past phylogenetic relationships of the influenza virus can help lead to information regarding treatment, resistance, vaccine strain selection, and of future possible influenza strains. By looking at how previous strains have evolved and gained new traits, the information can be applied to predict how current strains can evolve and even how novel strains might come about. Another use of phylogeny for predicting future viral dangers would be through using phylogeography. Various lineages may continue their presence and reassort indicating the importance of a complete-genome approach to determine new influenza strains and future epidemics. By studying how past strains have evolved while spreading to different geographic regions can allow scientists to predict how a strain might accumulate new mutations through its geographic distribution and the information could be used to protect different populations. All of these methods using historical data can help to diminish the effects of new influenza virus strains each flu season. By attempting to predict future mutations in HA and NA genes, scientists can choose vaccination strains that are likely to match future viruses, so antibodies can quickly recognize and mount an immune response against the virus. The one setback in this approach is that it is not useful against strains that evolve through antigenic shift (reassortment). It is impossible to predict when and with which strains these events will occur, and the fact that it could happen with strains from different species makes it all the more difficult. Until a method is found to accurately predict what mutations will arise and when they come about, vaccines will continue to be created purely on guesswork with no guarantee that they will provide total protection from influenza. Antiviral Resistance More recently, there has been a huge increase in the amount of resistance to certain drugs, including the antiviral compound adamantane. In fact, its resistance has recently climbed from 2 percent to nearly 90 percent. These records of built up resistance infer that drugs, such as adamantine, will not be useful against the influenza virus in the future.

Leicester Tigers  In May 2012, he signed a contract to join Aviva Premiership team Leicester Tigers.Leicester Tigers complete deal for wing Vereniki Goneva Goneva claimed that the only reason he chose to play for the Tigers was because their Rugby director, Richard Cockerill personally flew to France just to speak to him regarding him joining the club. He scored a try on debut against London Welsh in the 2012‚Äì13 English Premiership. He scored a try as well as setting one up for his other winger in the 2012‚Äì13 English Premiership Final helping his team win the title. Even though he was injured for most of the season, he played 11 games for them and scored 5 tries. In the 2013‚Äì14 English Premiership; in his first game against Worcester Warriors, he scored a stunning individual try to give him team a bonus-point win, a week later, he started at his preferred position at 13 and scored another brilliant try against Bath but it wasn't enough as the Tigers lost but Goneva's try secured them a bonus-point loss. He started at outside centre again in their game against the Chiefs due to a long term injury to their incumbent centre, Manu Tuilagi, scoring a try late in the first half, his performance got him the Man of the Match award as well. In March 2014, he scored 2 brilliant tries against Newcastle taking his tally to 10 for the season which has led to discussion by the club to try to hold on to Goneva for another season as he is in talks to return to France with Top 14 side, Castres. In April 2014, he re-signed with the Tigers for another two season. In May 2014, Goneva was crowned 2014 players' player of the year at Wednesday night's Rugby Players' Association awards dinner in Battersea.https://www.eurosport.com/rugby/players-player-gong-for- goneva_sto4257116/story-amp.shtml He started the new season the same way he ended the last season when he scored a hat-trick of tries against Newcastle taking his try tally for the Tigers to 27.

Early life  Borst was born and raised in Schoharie County, New York, the second son of U.S. Congressman Peter I. Borst and Catherine B. Borst. In 1847, he relocated from New York to Luray, Virginia, where he opened practice as a lawyer. Within a few years of his arrival, he met Isabella C. Almond, marrying her on 1 April 1851. Almond was a daughter of Edmund \\"Mann\\" Almond, a prominent Luray merchant and slaveholder (owning seven slaves in 1850, and five slaves in 1860). Soon after the arrival of the couple's son, Charles Manning, in 1851, Borst began construction on a new family home, \\"Aventine Hall\\", on a high point on the west end of Luray and within sight of the county court house. Borst had designed the house when he was 20, without consulting with any architects. Aventine Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.  Early career  In 1852, Borst began a long career as Commonwealth's Attorney for Page County, maintaining his office in the North wing of the courthouse. By 1860, he had accumulated considerable property and popularity in the county. He owned a farm by the mid-1850s and later built a three-story tannery that would be known as \\"one of the most flourishing establishments in the county\\" in antebellum Luray.  The Secession Convention  Borst was selected as Page County's delegate to the Virginia Convention of 1861 and was one of only four convention delegates (along with Raphael Morgan Conn and Samuel Croudson Williams of Shenandoah County, and Robert H. Turner of Warren County), from among the eighteen delegates from the Shenandoah Valley, to side with secession in the April 4 vote. At that time, sentiments in the Shenandoah Valley were much more Unionist than pro-secession. When he voted again in favor of secession on April 17, he was among the majority vote of the Shenandoah Valley delegates, only two (Edmund Pendleton of Berkeley County and John Francis Lewis of Rockingham County) voting against. In the proceedings, Borst was quoted as seeing his adopted county as \\"fully alive to the crisis, and prepared to meet it, come what may.\\"  The Civil War Years  Since Peter Borst stood out as a delegate of Virginia's secession convention, his home at \\"Aventine\\" would be earmarked as a building of interest by Union soldiers during multiple occupations of Luray during the war. The home was regularly occupied and used as a field hospital. Additionally, his tannery operations, providing a variety of leather goods in support of the Confederacy, would be burned twice, first on 22 December 1863. Though Borst attempted to rebuild his operation, the tannery was burned again during the October 1864 occupation. Having also relocated to Page County prior to the war, two of Borst's siblings, John B. and Addison A. Borst, served in the local \\"Page Volunteers\\" of Company K, 10th Virginia Infantry. Addison served as a corporal and was captured 12 May 1864 at Spotsylvania Court House. After spending several months at the POW camp at Point Lookout, Maryland, he was exchanged in October 1864. John B. Borst served initially as 1st sergeant of the company and later quartermaster sergeant of the regiment. Both brothers survived the war.  The post-Civil War Years  Following the war, Borst again secured his place as Commonwealth's Attorney until 1870, when, due to the military appointment of another judge, Borst was without office for one year. He resumed the post again in 1871. Perhaps the most significant contribution made by Borst to the county was his efforts to bring the railroad into the county. As a projector of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, he was successful in seeing that hope to fruition. Borst became the first president of the railroad in 1870 and, by 1881, trains were running through the county. In the midst of dealing with legal matters on Monday, 25 April 1882, Borst \\"suddenly and noiselessly\\" fell back in his chair, dead of apoplexy. He was laid to rest in Green Hill Cemetery in Luray, Virginia.  References  Further reading * Moore, Robert H.

Coasters The roller coaster trains are launched from their stations at high speed instead of the traditional chain lift. Linear Synchronous Motors (LSM) are used for high-acceleration speed during launching. Similar to the now-defunct Dragon Challenge at Universal's Islands of Adventure, these coasters feature several near collisions mere inches apart.

A week after its opening, Universal Studios Singapore identified a problem in a ride vehicle during routine testing. The ride closed for repair on 25 March 2010.Resorts World at Sentosa: STATEMENT ‚Äì BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, 25 March 2010. Retrieved 13.06.10 from Facebook. Both rides remained closed for about 11 months thereafter. In August 2010, Resorts World Sentosa publicly addressed the reason for closure of the ride, stating that the problem lies with the design of the ride vehicles and not the track layout. Higher than anticipated stress and vibration levels caused fatigue cracks to develop in the seat-post supports of the \\"Human\\" coaster car. The redesigned component was to eliminate the weld entirely and was also to be installed with additional strength-reinforcement parts. Extensive ride testing cycles and inspections were conducted, as the ride needed to be re-certified before it reopened to the public. In early February 2011, Universal Studios Singapore announced the rides would re-open on 21 February 2011, although it was opened unofficially for \\"technical rehearsals\\" on 4 February 2011. On 21 December 2010, Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon entered the final testing stage with newly reinforced cars for both the \\"Human\\" and \\"Cylon\\" coasters. The ride was scheduled to re-open in the first half of 2011. On 4 February 2011, the ride was opened unofficially for \\"technical rehearsals\\", with the ride scheduled to reopen on 21 February 2011. On 21 July 2013, the ride was closed again for review. More than a year passed before Resorts World Sentosa announced, in November 2014, that Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon would reopen in early 2015 with new trains. On 25 May 2015, Universal Studios Singapore announced that the ride will return with all-new ride vehicles on 27 May 2015. The ride was reopened officially two days later, with the ride vehicles being changed from four- abreast seating to two-abreast seating. On 6 April 2016 riders were stuck for about an hour when a technical error occurred on the ride.

He was also head of the pre-1959 revolution Communist Party of Cuba for 28 years and editor of the communist newspaper Hoy. He was a signatory of the Cuban Constitution of 1940 and chaired the committee that wrote the country's first socialist constitution in 1976. Political life Blas Roca, born Francisco Calderio in Manzanillo, Cuba, a leading theoretician of the Cuban Revolution who led Cuba's pre-revolutionary Communist Party for 28 years, left school at the age of 11 and began shining shoes to help support his poor family. He changed his name to Roca, meaning 'rock', after he joined the Communist Party in 1929.The New York Times In 1929, he was elected Secretary General of the Union of Shoemakers of Manzanillo. In August 1931 he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party and appointed head of his organization in the East. During this stage he displayed a wide journalistic activity in the labor press and led popular protests that culminated in the historic general strike of August 1933, which overthrew the Machado dictatorship.AccessMyLibrary Blas had grown remarkably in a few years as result of his abilities and participation in intensive popular and workers' struggles. He was called to the capital at a time the party needed a strong guiding direction, and replaced the party leader and poet Rub√©n Mart√≠nez Villena, who would make his last public appearance in September 1933 at the burial of fellow communist Julio Antonio Mella's ashes. Thus, at 26 years of age, Blas had become the leader of the Cuban Communists and would remain so until the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. He is credited for shifting the party from an ultra left sect to an influential national organization. In August 1935, Blas Roca attended the 7th Congress of the Communist International in Moscow, where Georgi Dimitrov outlined what became the new popular front strategy. Roca was instrumental in adapting the popular front to Cuban conditions. Originally identifying Fulgencio Batista with fascism, in 1938 at the Party's Tenth Plenary Assembly in Havana Blas Roca told the party leaders that circumstances had changed and Batista \\"ceased to be the leading figure in the reactionary camp.\\" According to K.S. Karol (Guerrillas in Power), Blas explained the threat of an economic and political crisis had split the Cuban Right into two camps: the fascists, who favored brute force to solve the crisis on the backs of the people, and the Batista forces who favored reforms and dialogue. An alliance with the Batista forces led to the legalization of the communist-led Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC), the party daily Hoy and the party itself, then known as the Uni√≥n Revolucionaria Comunista (Revolutionary Communist Union). The alliance continued into the Constituent Assembly elections of 1939 in which the communists elected 6 delegates, led by Roca and Juan Marinello. Roca would serve 12 years in the legislature. The resulting Cuban Constitution of 1940, with Blas Roca as one of the signers, embodied many progressive and socialist provisions. In the following presidential election, the communists supported Batista's candidacy as part of his Democratic Socialist Coalition. Years later, when Batista accused Fidel Castro's revolutionaries of being communist led, Castro reminded readers of the magazine Bohemia that Batista had been endorsed by the communists in 1940 and that former party members were then serving in the Batista government. In the 1930s, Roca's communist party also organized support for the Spanish Republic, with a formidable campaign that included not only moral and material assistance but also sending about a thousand Cuban combatants to the International Brigades. Under Blas Roca's direction, Cuba's communist party grew in size and influence with key control over trade unions and other support organizations. During World War II, two communists served in Batista's war-time cabinet as ministers without portfolio, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and Juan Marinello, both of whom would later serve in top positions under Fidel Castro. The party operated a popular radio station, Radio Mil Diez, and membership was in the tens of thousands. The party's influence grew tremendously during the Second World War as the U.S. and Cuba were allied with the Soviet Union. Support for the party was strongest among Cuban intellectuals and artists, and counted among its members and sympathizers such notable Cubans as the novelist Alejo Carpentier, the poet Juan Marinello, who served as the party's chair, the painter Wifredo Lam, the national poet Nicol√°s Guill√©n, the writers F√©lix Pita Rodr√≠guez, Mirta Aguirre, and Pablo de la Torriente Brau, and the economists Jacinto Torres and Ra√∫l Cepero Bonilla. As Tad Szulc wrote in his biography of Fidel Castro about the Cuban communists, \\"In truth, there were few creative personalities in Cuba since 1930 who were not on the left, or the extreme left\\" (Fidel: A Critical Portrait, 1986, p. 131). During the 1940s, the Cuban Communists renamed the Popular Socialist Party (PSP) followed the lead of U.S. Communist leader Earl Browder. Following the Second World War, as tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. intensified, the world communist movement condemned Browderism as a form of class collaboration and revisionism. The Cuban party, which under Roca's leadership had hewed closest to the Browder positions, such as forming a broad democratic alliance pushing policies to the left, denounced Browder and his views while remaining loyal to Stalinist principles. With Batista's coup of March 10, 1952, the party now weakened under the anti-communist Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s administration, condemned the actions. After Fidel Castro's July 26, 1953 attack on the Moncada army barracks, the Cuban communists condemned the attack as a \\"putsch\\" which did not involve mass struggle. At the time of the Moncada attack, party leaders were involved in a clandestine conference in Santiago and were also celebrating Roca's birthday (July 24). Batista quickly blamed the communist party for the \\"criminal incident.\\" As the party's ability to operate openly was blocked, key leaders began to rethink their attitude towards Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and the strategy of armed struggle. During the 1950s, the party went underground, and Blas Roca spent a whole year living in China in 1955-1956. Returning to Cuba with the victory of the revolution, Roca reorganized the party and firmly reoriented it under the leadership of Fidel Castro. In fact, Roca praised Castro for his armed strategy and criticized the party for failing to prepare for armed struggle. Blas Roca told the Eighth National Assembly of the PSP in August 1960: ‚Ä≥We rightly foresaw, and greatly looked forward to, the prospect that in response to conditions created by the tyranny, the masses would organize and eventually engage in armed struggle or popular insurrection. But for a long time we failed to take any practical steps to hasten that prospect, because we believed that these struggles, including a prolonged general strike, would culminate in armed insurrection quite spontaneously. Hence, we did not prepare, did not organize or train armed detachments.... That was our mistake. Fidel Castro's historical merit is that he prepared, trained, and assembled the fighting elements needed to begin and carry on armed struggle as a means of destroying the tyranny.‚Ä≥ (K.S. Karol, Guerrillas in Power, p. 149, footnote, 1970). Under Roca's leadership the Cuban communists were instrumental in providing an organizational and ideological structure for Castro's socialist revolution as well as playing a pivotal role using the party's long-standing ties with the Soviet Union to promote increasingly closer ties during the early days of the revolution. In 1961, Blas Roca, leading a party delegation, presented a Cuban flag to Nikita Khrushchev during a meeting of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards the communists dissolved into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, along with the 26th of July Movement and the Directorio Revolucionario, with communists holding at least 10 of the 24 National Directorate positions. Roca served on the first central committee and politburo of the new Communist Party of Cuba founded in 1965. Roca also served from 1976 through 1981 as president of the National Assembly of Popular Power, having chaired the committee that drafted the 1976 Cuban socialist constitution. His remains were buried in a simple grave near the monument to Cuban independence leader Antonio Maceo just outside Havana. Roca's son, Vladimiro Roca, is an outspoken dissident and critic of the current Cuban party and government, arrested numerous times for his public activities advocating for democratic reforms. Books Roca wrote numerous books, articles and pamphlets before and after the revolution, including The Foundations of Socialism in Cuba, published in 1943. The book was the primary text used in educating communist party militants from the 1940s on. After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, it was one of the main textbooks used by the Schools of Revolutionary Instruction (Escuelas de Instrucci√≥n Revolucionaria) to train leaders and party cadres in the newly- formed Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, the party merging the July 2nd Movement, the Popular Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Directorate, and eventually becoming the new Communist Party of Cuba in 1965.

Friendship Centres were first established in the 1950s, and there are now more than 100 Centres across Canada.http://www.nafc- aboriginal.com/PDF/NAFC%20News%20Release%20-%20English.pdf Friendship Centres typically provide a variety of programs and services to its members that can include youth programs, health services, housing, employment, cultural programs and more.  History of the Friendship Centre Movement  Friendship Centres emerged out a grassroots movement in the 1950s. The Friendship Centre Movement worked to establish organizations that could provide programs and services to a growing number of Indigenous people who had migrated to urban centres. This migration was largely a result of enfranchisement and assimilation policies in Canada, that meant many people were not allowed to return to their home communities and were forced to relocate to towns and cities. Native Friendship Centre of Montr√©al Some of the earliest Friendship Centres in Canada include the North American Indian Club, which was registered as a society in Toronto, Ontario in 1951, the Coqualeetza Fellowship Club which opened its doors in 1952 in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Indian and M√©tis Friendship Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. By 1968, there were 26 Friendship Centres in Canada. That number grew to 80 in 1983, and 118 in 2009.  Provincial Territorial Associations  Friendship Centres may be represented by multiple associations at the national or provincial level. There are 7 Provincial Territorial Associations (PTAs) in Canada including the National Association of Friendship Centres (NAFC), Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres (OFIFC), Aboriginal Friendship Centres of Saskatchewan, Manitoba Association of Friendship Centres, Alberta Native Friendship Centres Association, BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres, and the Northwest Territories/Nunavut Council of Friendship Centres. Sault Indian Friendship Centre  National Association of Friendship Centres  The National Association of Friendship Centres (NAFC) was established in 1972 to represent the growing number of Friendship Centres at the national level. The primary objectives are: to act as a central unifying body for the Friendship Centre Movement: to promote and advocate the concerns of Aboriginal Peoples: and, to represent the needs of local Friendship Centres across the country to the federal government and to the public in general. The NAFC is a non-profit organization governed by a voluntary Board of directors composed of eleven regional representatives and a youth representative. There is also a five-member Executive Committee, composed of the President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and Youth Executive. The composition of the NAFC Board of Directors is determined by the PTA's, which each appoint one representative. Where no PTA exists, the Friendship Centre can appoint one representative. Executive Committee members are elected for two year terms, at staggered intervals, at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Association. The AGM is attended by delegates from each member Centre and each PTA. The NAFC Board of directors meets quarterly during the year and the Executive committee normally meets once between each of these meetings, or when special circumstances arise. The NAFC also monitors the activities and programs of various federal government departments which have a mandate to provide either funding or services to urban Aboriginal people. The NAFC further acts as a central communications body and facilitates external liaisons for both the Friendship Centres and the PTA's. This function ensures that the membership has timely access to information which may impact on their operations. The NAFC is also active on a number of external committees and associations which are related to urban Aboriginal people in areas such as: literacy, racism, AIDS, employment equity, economic development and justice to name a few. = Programs and service delivery = Friendship Centres offer a variety of programs and services in a culturally appropriate manner, practising an open- door policy where anyone, regardless of race, religion, income or nationality can access programs. Visitors to Friendship Centres can often find access to referral and advocacy services, cultural programs, education and training, employment counselling, health programs, justice programs, children and youth programs, recreation programs and economic development. Friendship Centres also offer language training, entrepreneurial training, skills development, computer training, work site placements, nutrition programs, healing circles, alcohol and drug counselling, summer camps, day care centres, youth peer counselling, youth drop in centres, organized sports and leagues, wilderness training and facility rentals. Many Centres also have arts and crafts shops and organize pow-wows and other events throughout the year. Friendship Centres provide over 1.3 million client contacts across Canada within the programs and services offered every year. = Senate = Part of the Friendship Centre Movement, Senators are individuals who are recognized for representing a set of values which reflect past developments of the Movement while allowing the current leadership and Membership the right to define their own direction. The Senate are established by and part of the National Association of Friendship Centres governing Constitution and Bylaws. Senators attend as advisors, on a rotating basis, all meetings of the Board of Directors, Annual General Meetings and other such special meetings of the membership, when invited. = Aboriginal Youth Council = The Aboriginal Youth Council (AYC) discusses and identifies youth priority issues, including stay in school initiatives; healing and wellness; suicide; preserving culture and heritage; cross cultural awareness; homelessness; youth leadership; employment and training; youth involvement at all levels of the Friendship Centre Movement; and more specifically, youth involvement in the decision-making processes of the Movement. The AYC defines youth as being between the ages of 14-24.  Funding Programs for Friendship Centres  In 1972 the Government of Canada formally recognized the viability of Friendship Centres and implemented the Migrating Native Peoples Program (MNPP). The MNPP was given a four-year mandate to provide 40 Friendship Centres and the NAFC with core operating funds. In 1976 the MNPP was extended for one year in order to evaluate the program's effectiveness. In 1978, the program was renewed with a five-year mandate and enhanced resources which enabled and expansion to 80 Friendship Centres by 1983. In 1983, the NAFC and the Department of the Secretary of State (DSOS) successfully negotiated the evolution of the MNPP to the Native Friendship Centre Program (NFCP). This program had a five-year mandate and in 1988, the NFCP was renewed as the Aboriginal Friendship Centres Program (AFCP), which became a permanent funding program. However, the funding relationship fundamentally changed in 1996, when the administrative responsibility for the AFCP was transferred from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the NAFC. This new agreement meant that all operational funding for the AFCP would be administered by the NAFC to the local Friendship Centres and the PTAs.

In 1912, he was selected as an All-American at the tackle position. Biography Trickey was a native of Iowa Falls, Iowa. He played four years of football at Iowa Falls High School. Trickey enrolled at the University of Iowa and played on the freshman football team in 1909. He played for the school's varsity football team in 1910, 1911 and 1912. He was an All-State player all three years, an All-Western player two years, and an All-American as a senior in 1912. In addition to schoolwork and football, Trickey \\"worked his way through the university ... by preaching in country churches.\\" During two of his summers, he also served as a missionary in the Dakotas. Prior to his senior year in 1912, Trickey announced that he would not play football, stating that he would spend his time on his studies. He was persuaded to return to the gridiron after \\"a petition was circulated and signed by practically the entire student body for his return.\\" He was also unanimously elected as the president of the university's senior class. At the end of the 1912 football season, Trickey was selected as a second-team All- American by Walter Camp, the highest postseason honor ever given by Camp to an Iowa player. Trickey was also selected as a first-team All-American by Alfred S. Harvey of the Milwaukee Free Press At the conclusion of the 1912 football season, The Iowa Alumnus magazine wrote: \\"All hats are off to 'Jim' Trickey, a player who exhibited the highest type of loyalty for his Alma Mater when after seven successive seasons of hard buffeting on the gridiron he listened to the pleas of his friends and consented to make a big sacrifice for Old Iowa, when he took the time and energy from heavy school work and outside employment to play through this last season. Trickey‚Äôs work was easily the feature of the year. He was the strong point in Iowa‚Äôs line on the defense and when called upon to carry the ball he repeatedly went through the strong opposing lines on long gains. He demonstrated early in his career his ability to puncture the strongest defense.\\" Trickey had five brothers who also played college football. In 1912, the Waterloo Evening Courier noted: > \\"With the selection of James Trickey of the 1912 Iowa football team as an > All-Western tackle by Patterson of Collier's this week comes the story from > Iowa Falls that the Trickey family will go down in history as one of this > state's most remarkable families for the production of football players. The > last of a line of six brothers went to Ellsworth college at Iowa Falls this > year and is now playing freshman football there, the five preceding him, one > of whom was Iowa's 'Jim' Trickey, having played their various periods at > different schools of the state.\\" After completing his university studies in 1913, Trickey returned to Iowa Falls where he engaged in the insurance business as the district agent for \\"a big eastern life insurance company.\\" He also became engaged in 1913 to Carrie Stanley of Adams County, Iowa. Trickey died in December 1913. Trickey was traveling in Waterloo, Iowa when he became ill and was advised to return home. After returning to Iowa City, his condition worsened and an operation was performed that disclosed peritonitis. While some initial reports indicated that his death was \\"the ultimate result of an injury\\" sustained in the Iowa- Minnesota football game of 1912, the cause of death was ultimately determined to be an abscess that formed in his stomach on the opposite side from the football injury. In what was described as \\"an unusual tribute,\\" the flags on all of the college buildings at Iowa City were flown at half staff until after Trickey‚Äôs funeral. A tribute to Trickey was published The Iowa Yearbook for the Class of 1915 which included the following comments: > \\"It is difficult to describe adequately the imprint of this one life upon > the lives of the undergraduates and alumni of the University of Iowa. 'Jim' > gave the best that was in him to his school, whether in the Young Men‚Äôs > Christian Association, the classroom, or on the gridiron. Trickey was a real > man; he had real character; he possessed real friendships; he had real > courage; he was real in every sense of the word.

He was active in the Civil Rights Movement and is perhaps best known as a mentor and friend of Martin Luther King Jr. Proctor sat at the feet of his Mentor The Great Rev. Dr. BG Crawley who was a Prominent Baptist Minister in Brooklyn, NY and New York State Judge. Early life Samuel DeWitt Proctor was born in Norfolk, Virginia on July 13, 1921. Unusual for an African American born in this era, Proctor's grandparents on both sides had received education at the university level: his paternal grandmother had attended Hampton Institute, and both of his maternal grandparents had attended Norfolk Mission College. His parents, Herbert Proctor and Velma Hughes met while they were both students at Norfolk Mission College. Proctor was raised as a Baptist and as a child attended the congregation that had been founded by his great-grandfather, Zechariah Hughes. Herbert Proctor worked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, there in Virginia. Proctor graduated from high school in 1937 and enrolled at Virginia State College, having won a music scholarship to attend. During his time at Virginia State College, he played saxophone in a jazz band, along with famed jazz pianist Billy Taylor where they both joined Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. In 1939, he left Virginia State College without taking a degree and enrolled in the U.S. Naval Apprentice School to receive training to become a shipfitter. He abandoned that line of study after only a year, and in 1940 matriculated at Virginia Union University. He married his classmate Bessie Tate while he was a student at Virginia Union University. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1942. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania for one year before enrolling as the only black student at Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania in order to pursue a career in the Christian ministry. Proctor's professors at Crozer had been highly influenced by higher criticism, and learning from them caused Proctor to question the literal truth of the Bible, leading him to question his faith. While studying at Crozer, Proctor worshiped at the Calvary Baptist Church and became known as one of the \\"Sons of Calvary\\" along with Martin Luther King, Jr. and William Augustus Jones, Jr., all who went on to be well known preachers in the black church. Proctor received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Crozer in 1945.  Work  Following graduation, Proctor accepted a call to become pastor of the Pond Street Church in Providence, Rhode Island. At the same time, he accepted the John Price Crozer Fellowship to study ethics at Yale University. Proctor found splitting his time between Providence and New Haven, Connecticut onerous, so after a year, he moved to Boston, enrolling at the Boston University School of Theology. He received a Ph.D. in Theology from Boston University in 1950. In 1950, Proctor was invited to give a lecture at Crozer Theological Seminary, his alma mater, and it was there that he first met and befriended Martin Luther King, Jr., who was a student at Crozer at the time. Proctor told King that the works of Reinhold Niebuhr and Harry Emerson Fosdick (especially Fosdick's The Modern Use of the Bible (1924)) had been crucial in helping him reconcile his Christian faith with the brand of liberal Christianity taught at Crozer. Proctor accepted a position at his other alma mater, Virginia Union University, and there began a meteoric rise from dean to vice-president, before being appointed as president of Virginia Union University in 1955 at the unusually young age of 33. Shortly after his appointment as university president, in December 1955, King invited Proctor to Montgomery, Alabama to speak; in the middle of Montgomery bus boycott, Proctor delivered a \\"Spring Lecture Series\\". Proctor was one of several black leaders invited to the White House by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In the wake of Brown v. Board of Education, Eisenhower asked these leaders to \\"ease off\\" on their demands for civil rights for African Americans. Proctor and the other black leaders politely refused Eisenhower's request. During his time as president of Virginia Union University (1955‚Äì60), Proctor traveled extensively abroad for the first time in his life: he lectured in the Soviet Union, toured the Auschwitz concentration camp, attended conferences in Africa and the South Pacific, and visited Africa for the first time. In 1960, Proctor left Virginia Union University to become president of the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (which is today North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University) in Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in the middle of the Greensboro sit-ins, Proctor did not publicly support the student protesters, believing that quiet diplomacy was more effective than confrontation in advancing the civil rights agenda. However, behind the scenes, he and other school administrators raised money for arrested students, and helped to find them lawyers. (Jesse Jackson was the college's student body president and quarterback of the college's football team at this time.) Proctor had strong ties to the Kennedy administration and in 1963-64 he took a leave of absence from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina to serve as associate director of the newly established Peace Corps chapter in Africa. In this capacity, Proctor was living in Washington, D.C. at the time of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He and his family moved to Nigeria shortly thereafter, and while there, his children became the first black children at a previously all-white school. Upon his return to the United States, Proctor resumed his presidential duties as of September 1, 1963 but on March 1, 1964, he announced his resignation to become effective April 10, 1964, citing his desire to devote himself to public service in the wake of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Proctor spent a year (1964‚Äì65) as president of the National Council of Churches. He was a supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, serving as a special adviser to the Office of Economic Opportunity for the northeast region. He then became president of the Institute for Service to Education. In 1966, he published a book about the challenges facing young African Americans entitled The Young Negro in America, 1960-1980. In 1968, he accompanied Hubert Humphrey and Thurgood Marshall to Africa, and, upon his return to the U.S., spoke out against the political corruption that was rife in Africa. He was also asked to testify to the U.S. Senate's committee on education, chaired by Jacob K. Javits; there he testified in favor of student loans, Head Start, Upward Bound, and work-study programs. Proctor learned all that he knew and sat at the feet of his mentor The late great Reverend Dr. BG Crawley Pastor and founder of the Little Zion Baptist Church, who was a Prominent Baptist Minister and New York State Judge in Brooklyn New York. Rev Crawley was a mentor to some of the Greatest orators of our time including, Sandy Ray,Gardner C Taylor, William A.Jones, Wyatt T Walker , EK Baily just to name a few. In 1969, Proctor was invited by Rutgers University to give a lecture on the one-year anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Many of the college's administrators were there and were impressed by the address, and they soon offered Proctor the newly established position of Martin Luther King Distinguished Professor of Education. Proctor accepted their offer and held this position until his retirement in 1984. Upon the death of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in 1972, Proctor also assumed the pastorate of the 18,000-member Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Under the Carter administration, Proctor served as a special adviser on an ethics committee on recombinant DNA research. Calvin O. Butts served as Proctor's associate pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church for a number of years. Under Proctor's leadership, the congregation joined the American Baptist Churches USA and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. With Butts, the Abyssinian Baptist Church founded the Abyssinian Development Corporation and built 50 housing units for needy families. Proctor resigned his pastorate in 1989 and was replaced by Butts. Proctor later spent time as an adjunct faculty member and/or visiting professor at Vanderbilt University, United Theological Seminary, Kean University, and Duke University. Proctor was the recipient of 45 honorary degrees in the course of his life.  Death  In 1997, during a speaking engagement at Cornell College (in Mount Vernon, Iowa), Proctor suffered a heart attack which proved fatal.  Legacy and honors  The Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University was named in his memory. The Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University established an endowed chair named for Proctor in the early 2000s. In 2019, the school opened the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Institute for Leadership, Equity, and Justice. Notes References * Sholomo B.

By contrast, the Meyerian perspective is phenomenologically oriented. It stresses the dependence of local social organization on institutionalized models and definitions, promulgated by professionals and associations to promote collective goods. The dependence involved is more than causal influence. In the Meyerian view, institutional environments constitute local structures ‚Äì establishing and defining their core entities, purposes, and interrelationships. Enacted models thus are often decoupled from local circumstances.Stanford University (2016) 'FSI - John Meyer'. http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/John_Meyer Meyer initially developed the general perspective in the context of schooling. Departing from conventional views, Meyer envisioned schools as embodiments of collective myth and ceremonial administration, deeply bound to Modern narratives of progress and justice. His framework, developed with Francisco O. Ramirez and others, reveals the profound extent to which local school arrangements depend on broader social institutions to supply their form and function. He next applied his ideas to the field of organizations. He helped pioneer the sociological new institutionalism,1977\\\\. \\"Institutionalized Organizations: Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony\\" (with Brian Rowan). American Journal of Sociology 83: 340-63 stressing the role of loose coupling in organizational behavior and the conditions under which the diffusion of practices takes place (e.g. Organizational Environments, with W. Richard Scott, Sage 1983). A primary contention is that formal organizations incorporate institutionalized practices and procedures in order to maintain legitimacy. Organizations that align with the myths supplied by their institutional environments increase their survival prospects, even when doing so costs them internal coherence. The third area in which Meyer's work has had broad influence, and the area in which his ideas may finally have their most durable impact, is in the analysis of world society. In 1980, he coined the term \\"world polity\\" to describe the stateless character of the international system and distinguish a civil society approach to globalization from existing world-systems analysis.1980\\\\. \\"The World Polity and the Authority of the Nation-State.\\" In A. Bergesen (ed.), Studies of the Modern World-System. Academic Press: 109-37. Meyer and coauthors John Boli, Francisco O. Ramirez, and George M. Thomas applied insights from his analyses of organizations to the global level, showing that even nation-states are constituted, shaped, and restructured by forces operating in their enveloping institutional environments.1997\\\\. \\"World Society and the Nation-State\\" (with John Boli, George M. Thomas, and Francisco O. Ramirez). American Journal of Sociology 103: 144-81. This line of work uniquely accounts for several peculiar features of global change that other perspectives fail to notice: structural isomorphism; rapid, worldwide change in the nature and purposes of states in regard to environmentalism, the status of women, etc.; the decoupling of national development plans and programs from specific local conditions; and so on. The development of this theoretical paradigm has motivated much of Meyer's later work. Accordingly, Meyer's earlier interests in schooling and organizations were subsequently explored in the context of world society, e.g. the influences of modern world practices on educational systems and their expansion over time.Stanford University (2016) 'John W. Meyer'. https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/instructor/meyer Over the course of his career, Meyer has authored or co-authored more than 200 scholarly articles and books.Stanford Comparative Sociology Workshop (2003) 'papers'. http://web.stanford.edu/group/csw/papers.html In 2009, Georg Kr√ºcken and Gili S. Drori edited a retrospective of Meyer's work entitled World Society: The Writings of John W. Meyer. Currently, he is studying the impact of the human rights regime worldwide, and the impact of global society on national states and societies.

They are distinct from the novelty plasma lamps that were popular in the 1980s. The internal-electrodeless lamp was invented by Nikola Tesla after his experimentation with high-frequency currents in evacuated glass tubes for the purposes of lighting and the study of high voltage phenomena. The first practical plasma lamps were the sulfur lamps manufactured by Fusion Lighting. This lamp suffered a number of practical problems and did not prosper commercially. Plasma lamps with an internal phosphor coating are called external electrode fluorescent lamps (EEFL); these external electrodes or terminal conductors provide the radio frequency electric field. Description Modern plasma lamps are a family of light sources that generate light by exciting plasma inside a closed transparent burner or bulb using radio frequency (RF) power. Typically, such lamps use a noble gas or a mixture of these gases and additional materials such as metal halides, sodium, mercury or sulfur. In modern plasma lamps, a waveguide is used to constrain and focus the electrical field into the plasma. In operation, the gas is ionized, and free electrons, accelerated by the electrical field, collide with gas and metal atoms. Some atomic electrons circling around the gas and metal atoms are excited by these collisions, bringing them to a higher energy state. When the electron falls back to its original state, it emits a photon, resulting in visible light or ultraviolet radiation, depending on the fill materials. The first commercial plasma lamp was an ultraviolet curing lamp with a bulb filled with argon and mercury vapor developed by Fusion UV. That lamp led Fusion Lighting to the development of the sulfur lamp, a bulb filled with argon and sulfur that is bombarded with microwaves through a hollow waveguide. The bulb had to be spun rapidly to prevent it burning through. Fusion Lighting did not prosper commercially, but other manufacturers continue to pursue sulfur lamps. Sulfur lamps, though relatively efficient, have had a number of problems, chiefly: #Limited life ‚Äì Magnetrons had limited lives. #Large size #Heat ‚Äì The sulfur burnt through the bulb wall unless they were rotated rapidly. #High power demand ‚Äì They could not sustain a plasma in powers under 1000W. Limited life In the past, the life of the plasma lamps was limited by the magnetron used to generate the microwaves. Solid state RF chips can be used and give long lives. However, using solid-state chips to generate RF is currently an order of magnitude more expensive than using a magnetron and so only appropriate for high-value lighting niches. It has recently been shown by Dipolar of Sweden to be possible to extend the life of magnetrons to over 40,000 hours, making low- cost plasma lamps possible. Heat and power The use of a high-dielectric waveguide allowed the sustaining of plasmas at much lower powers‚Äîdown to 100 W in some instances. It also allowed the use of conventional gas-discharge lamp fill materials which removed the need to spin the bulb. The only issue with the ceramic waveguide was that much of the light generated by the plasma was trapped inside the opaque ceramic waveguide. High-efficiency plasma (HEP) High-efficiency plasma lighting is the class of plasma lamps that have system efficiencies of 90 lumens per watt or more. Lamps in this class are potentially the most energy-efficient light source for outdoor, commercial and industrial lighting. This is due not only to their high system efficiency but also to the small light source they present enabling very high luminaire efficiency. Luminaire Efficacy Rating (LER) is the single figure of merit the National Electrical Manufacturers Association has defined to help address problems with lighting manufacturers' efficiency claims Procedure for Determining Luminaire Efficacy Ratings for High-Intensity Discharge (HID) Industrial Luminaires and is designed to allow robust comparison between lighting types. It is given by the product of luminaire efficiency (EFF) times total rated lamp output in lumens (TLL) times ballast factor (BF), divided by the input power in watts (IP): :LER = EFF √ó TLL √ó BF / IP The \\"system efficiency\\" for a High Efficiency Plasma lamp is given by the last three variables, that is, it excludes the luminaire efficiency. Though plasma lamps do not have a ballast, they have an RF power supply that fulfills the equivalent function. In electrodeless lamps, the inclusion of the electrical losses, or \\"ballast factor\\", in lumens per watt claimed can be particularly significant as conversion of electrical power to radio frequency (RF) power can be a highly inefficient process. Many modern plasma lamps have very small light sources‚Äîfar smaller than HID bulbs or fluorescent tubes‚Äîleading to much higher luminaire efficiencies also. High intensity discharge lamps have typical luminaire efficiencies of 55%, and fluorescent lamps of 70%. Plasma lamps typically have luminaire efficiencies exceeding 90%. Applications Plasma lamps have been used in high bay and street lighting applications, as well as in stage lighting. They were briefly used in some projection televisions.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Economics from the University of Kentucky in 1966 and a Master's Degree in Diplomacy and International Commerce from the same institution in 1968. From there, he moved to the University of Wisconsin, where he earned a second master's degree in 1970 and, two years later, a Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics. Deaton was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nan, Thailand from 1962-1964. He taught vocational agriculture in the Thai language. Academic career After receiving his Ph.D. in 1972, Deaton accepted a position at the University of Tennessee, where he taught agricultural economics and rural sociology. During his tenure at Tennessee, he briefly left to serve as staff director of the Special Task Force on Food for Peace at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. In 1978, Deaton accepted a full professorship at Virginia Tech in the Department of Agricultural Economics, where he also served as coordinator of the rural development research and extension program. Deaton spent 12 years at Virginia Tech, the last four as associate director of the Office for International Development. In March 1989, he joined the faculty of the University of Missouri as professor and chair of the Agricultural Economics Department. Deaton has published over 100 articles and has co-written three books on agricultural economics. He has also participated in a number of advisory roles with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. His research has taken him to over a dozen countries and he has advised governors, universities, major corporations and diplomats on various topics related to agriculture, global trade and higher education. Administrative career Deaton transitioned from faculty to administration in 1993, when he was appointed chief of staff to the chancellor of the University of Missouri. He was promoted to deputy chancellor in 1997. In January 1998, Deaton was appointed interim provost and named to the permanent position in October of that year. In 2001, his duties were expanded when he was given the additional role of executive vice chancellor for academic affairs. In 2004, Deaton was named chancellor of the University of Missouri. On June 12, 2013, Deaton announced his retirement as chancellor, effective November 15, 2013. Professional service Deaton serves or has served on a number of state and national committees and boards.

It features a legal analysis of the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis with a specific examination of the legality of President Manuel Zelaya's 28 June 2009 removal from office and expatriation. Commission and publication According to the office of Congressman Schock, the report was first commissioned by him through the Congressional Research Service. CRS then referred it the Law Library of Congress, another congressional research agency. Prepared in August 2009 by the LLoC, the report was released by Schock via his website on 24 September 2009. Findings According to the report, the case for his removal from office was rooted in constitutional and statutory law, but his removal from the country was not. The report concluded that \\"the National Congress made use of its constitutional prerogative to interpret the Constitution and interpreted the word ‚Äúdisapprove‚Äù to include also the removal from office...[W]hen the National Congress issued its Decree removing President Zelaya from office, it used its powers as needed.\\" The report distinguishes between what it argues to be the legal removal from office of Zelaya--\\"the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was judged by the Honduran authorities from both branches of the government to be in accordance with the Honduran legal system\\"‚Äîand the illegal removal of Zelaya from Honduras--\\"[the] removal of President Zelaya from the country by the military is in direct violation of the Article 102 of the Constitution.\\" Reaction and controversy The LLoC report became the subject of intense controversy and criticism in the weeks following its release. Various analysts disputed the report's findings regarding Honduran constitutional law, in particular the assumption that Congress can interpret the Constitution (which they claim is a privilege reserved to the Supreme Court by a Supreme Court ruling on 7 May 2003), though the later Decree 241-2003 of 20 January 2004, signed by the President of the Republic on 31 January 2004, ratified a change to Article 205(10) of the Honduran Constitution to allow the Honduran Congress to interpret the Constitution in an ordinary session by a two-thirds vote. United States' politicians took opposites sides on the appropriateness of the report and its conclusions, with several Democrats seeking to amend or withdraw the report and various Republicans arguing the report supports their backing of the de facto government. Schock himself argued that the Obama Administration should change its policy towards Honduras by resuming suspended aid and recognizing the upcoming November 29 elections, based on the contents of the report. In late October 2009, the chairmen of the House and Senate foreign relations committees, Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Representative Howard Berman (D-Calif.), asked the Law Library of Congress to retract the LLoC report, that they charged was flawed and \\"[had] contributed to the political crisis that still wracks\\" Honduras. Kerry and Berman said the report \\"contains factual errors and is based on a flawed legal analysis that has been refuted by experts from the United States, the Organization of American States and Honduras.\\" They also charge that a key line in the analysis was based on a provision of the Honduran Constitution that was struck down in 2003 and that \\"critical portions rely exclusively on a single, outside individual who had previously and publicly declared his support for the coup.\\" Republicans, who criticized the Obama administration for not recognizing the de facto Honduran government, accused the chairmen of looking to stifle dissent. A spokeswoman for the Law Library of Congress‚Äîone of six Library of Congress agencies‚Äîsaid on 29 October 2009 that the research agency stood by the report and that Librarian of Congress James Billington would prepare a response to the lawmakers who have requested retraction or correction of the report. On the popular legal blog, The Volokh Conspiracy, conservative American law professor and legal commentator Jonathan H. Adler noted the fact that U.S. State Department lawyer Harold Koh's legal analysis of the Zelaya's ouster, which guides the Obama Administration's response to the events in Honduras, has not yet been released to the public, making the LLoC report the only official legal analysis of the situation released to the public by the US Government.

For practical reasons it is often not reasonable to obtain information from all possible business units, so that only a subset are contacted.  Overview  Questionnaires are distributed to businesses, asking for information on various aspects of their operations. Sometimes completion of the questionnaires is voluntary; sometimes it is required by law. Typically, information is requested on the business's purchases, output, sales, capital expenditures and numbers of workers employed. The level of detail asked for varies considerably. For example, regarding purchases, it may be that all that is asked for is a single figure representing total purchases, or it may be that a breakdown of purchases by type of commodity is requested.  History  In the United Kingdom, the first \\"Census of Production\\" was carried out in respect of 1907, under the authority of the 1906 Census of Production Act; however, some of the topics it covered had been the subject of government surveys for a long time before then. The Board of Trade - equivalent of the modern British Department of Trade and Industry; was formed in 1786, and from a fairly early point in its existence began collecting trade statistics, albeit in a not very well-organised manner. However, in 1832 a separate department for statistics-gathering was formed within the Board, and began publishing a yearbook. Although the yearbook's main focus was on import- export trade, it contained some information on domestic commercial activities. By the 1870s, considerable amounts of information were being gathered by various branches of government on employment and wages, and on agriculture. The first Census of Wages was conducted in 1886. Although the 1906 Census of Productions Bill was introduced by David Lloyd George and had opposition support from Joseph Chamberlain, it was met with considerable suspicion by manufacturers, and several Members of Parliament expressed concerns about it, including that the manufacturers were \\"sacrificing their liberty to a gang of clerks in Downing street.\\" Another concern was that manufacturers' trade secrets would be compromised. The unit for the Census was the \\"establishment\\", essentially a single business location, although minor ancillaries such as offices, warehouses, laboratories, and canteens, could be subsumed under it. A single company could have several \\"establishments\\". In 1958, the size of the unit was increased to the \\"business unit\\": a firm or company or group of companies, but in 1963 the unit reverted to the \\"establishment\\". In 1987, company-based reporting was again instituted. Also at that time, the scope of the survey was expanded to include all activity, not just production activity; and activity was classified to the industry of the company.Smith and Penneck, section 8.1. In 1998, the Census of Production was subsumed into the \\"Annual Business Inquiry\\", later the Annual Business Survey, which also replaced and integrated the Annual Census of Construction, the Purchases Inquiry, the Annual Employment Survey, and the six surveys covering the distribution and services sector: retail, wholesale, motor trades, catering, property, and (other) services.Smith and Penneck, section 6.1.

The authors coined for it the new genus Pariosternarchus, from the Greek pario (\\"cheek\\", referring to the wide head), and sternon + archos (\\"chest\\" + \\"rectum\\", a commonly used name for apteronotids that refers to the anterior position of the urogenital opening). From morphological similarities, P. amazonensis is thought to belong to the navajini, an informal taxonomic group of apteronotids adapted to fast-flowing, large rivers, with the genus Sternarchella being its closest relatives. Distribution and habitat Pariosternarchus amazonensis occurs in the Amazon River, along the Rio Solim√µes in Brazil from the confluence of the Rio Japur√° to the confluence of the Rio Madeira, and near the city of Iquitos in Peru. It can be found in deep river channels, flooded beaches, and the mouths of large whitewater tributaries. Description Pariosternarchus amazonensis has a wide head, measuring up to a seventh as wide as long, with a completely flat ventral surface. The mouth is small and slung beneath the moderately long snout; conical teeth are present in both jaws. The sensory canals along the mandible are highly expanded. P. amazonensis is laterally compressed with a short body cavity. Like other members of its family, it has a long anal fin, a minute caudal fin, no pelvic or dorsal fins, and an electroreceptive dorsal appendage that originates about halfway along the back. There are 155-168 anal fin rays, 14-15 pectoral fin rays, and 16-17 caudal fin rays. The scales are large and diamond-shaped, with 6-8 rows above the lateral line but not reaching the upper surface of the head and body. Virtually unpigmented aside from tiny chromatophores speckling the bottom of the head and branchiostegal membranes, P. amazonensis is uniformly white-pink with translucent fins. The largest known specimen is long. Biology and ecology The highly compressed form, small eyes, and reduced scales and coloration of P. amazonensis are consistent with living in deep (up to 25 m), fast-moving waters in large rivers. Its broad, flat-bottomed head and small, subterminal mouth suggest that it is a benthic forager. P. amazonensis is presumably capable of producing an electric field for electrolocation and communication like all other gymnotiforms, though its electric organ discharge (EOD) has not been described. Human interactions The conservation status of P. amazonensis has not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press. p. xviii. . \\"Elliot wrote Chuenpee for what some have written Chuenpi and is called Chuanbi in pinyin\\". was a naval engagement fought between British and Chinese ships at the entrance of the Humen strait (Bogue), Guangdong province, China, on 3 November 1839 during the First Opium War. The battle began when the British frigates HMS Hyacinth and HMS Volage opened fire on Chinese ships they perceived as being hostile.  Background  For foreign ships to be allowed to dock in Canton (Guangzhou) for trade, Chinese authorities required a signed bond agreeing not to trade opium. Captain Charles Elliot, Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China, ordered British ships not to sign the bond because if opium was found, the cargo would be confiscated and the perpetrators executed. This in turn interfered with the trade of British merchantmen in China.Elleman, Bruce A. (2001). Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795-1989. London: Routledge. pp. 18‚Äì20. . In October 1839 a cargo ship, the Thomas Coutts, arrived in Canton from Singapore. The ship carried cotton from Bombay, and, since the captain was not trading opium, he defied Elliot's request and signed the Chinese bond. He held a legal view that Elliot's ban on the signing was not valid under English law.Additional Correspondence Relating to China. London: T. R. Harrison. 1840. pp. 8‚Äì9.Hanes, William Travis; Sanello, Frank (2002). The Opium Wars: The Addiction of One Empire and the Corruption of Another. Naperville, Illinois: Sourcebooks. pp. 68‚Äì70. . Thomas Coutts in 1836 Before Warner left China, Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu gave him a letter addressed to Queen Victoria in which he disapproved the use of opium and requested the opium trade to stop. After arriving in London, he handed the letter to a co-owner of the Thomas Coutts, who asked for an appointment with Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston. After Palmerston's office refused to see him, Warner forwarded the letter to The Times, which published it. Viewing Warner's defiance as a threat to his authority, Elliot ordered and to be positioned south of the Chuenpi battery on 27 October to blockade any other British ships bound for Canton.  Battle  Volage and Hyacinth in Chuenpi After a second British ship, , tried to defy Elliot's blockade on 3 November 1839, Volage under Captain Henry Smith fired a warning shot across the Royal Saxons bow. In response, Chinese war junks under Admiral Guan Tianpei moved out to protect Royal Saxon. After Elliot gave in to Smith's pressure for an attack, the more maneuverable British ships approached the Chinese vessels and fired broadsides at them from starboard. Depiction of the battle by Captain Peter William Hamilton Smith wrote, \\"I did not conceive that it would be becoming the dignity of our flag, the safety of the merchant shipping below, and my own character, to retire before such an imposing force, sent out at that moment evidently for the purpose of intimidation.\\"The Annual Register, or a View of the History and Politics, of the Year 1840. London: J. G. F. & J. Rivington. 1841. p. 571. According to a Chinese account by Wei Yuan, \\"five of our war-ships went to preserve order on the sea-board\\" and \\"the English mistook our red flags for a declaration of war, and opened fire;‚Äîfor in Europe a red flag means war, and a white one peace.\\"Parker, Edward Harper (1888). Chinese Account of the Opium War. Shanghai: Kelly & Walsh. pp. 10‚Äì11. One Chinese fire raft immediately sank, and a war junk exploded after its magazine was struck. After the first run, the Volage and Hyacinth turned and repeated the same maneuver using their port broadsides. The stationary guns on the Chinese vessels could not be aimed effectively. One junk was blown up, three were sunk, and several others were damaged. Faced with superior firepower, the Chinese fleet sailed away except for Kuan's 12-cannon flagship, which returned fire. Since it posed a minimal threat, Elliot ordered Smith to stop firing, allowing the damaged flagship to sail off. The Volage sustained light damage on its sails and rigging, and the mizzen-mast of the Hyacinth was hit by a 12-pound (5.4 kg) ball. One British sailor was wounded and 15 Chinese were killed.  Aftermath  The Royal Saxon sailed on to Canton and Elliot returned to Macau. Historian Bruce A. Elleman wrote, \\"the origin of this battle was not even between the British and the Chinese, but was really as a result of the British Navy fighting to stop one of Elliot's own British ships that had refused to uphold his free-trade principles. The 'Battle of Chuanbi,' perhaps more than any other conflict during the Opium War, vividly revealed the underlying free-trade tensions.\\"  References  Category:1839 in China Chuenpi 1 Chuenpi Category:History of Guangdong Chuenpi 1 Category:November 1839 events ","title":"Battle of Chuenpi"},{"id":"24969777","text":"Stage School Australia (formerly Children's Performing Company of Australia - CPCA) is a Melbourne-based performing arts training provider for young people. Established in 1984 as the Victorian Children's Theatre. It notably encompasses the Young Australian Broadway Chorus and the Victorian Youth Theatre. Since its foundation, the organisation has expanded to twenty one locations across the greater Melbourne area to become one of the largest performing arts tuition providers in the state of Victoria. Performing Arts Tuition Stage School offers several streams of training which, depending on the age of the young people, can be conducted separately or concurrently. Most streams have a hierarchical structure wherein students may be promoted to a more advanced group, based on the student's skill level and experience. Young Australian Broadway Chorus In 1995, the company established four theatre ensembles with a strong musical theatre focus. These expanded to become what is now known as the Young Australian Broadway Chorus (YABC), the stream which trains students in singing, dancing and acting. The YABC's first performance was held in 1998 at the National Theatre in St Kilda - a gala performance much simpler than the more extravagant shows that are put on in the same theatre by YABC students today. Victorian Youth Theatre The Victorian Youth Theatre (VYT) is the drama branch of Stage School's performing arts training activities, which originally traded in the 1980s as the Victorian Children's Theatre. While trading as the Victorian Children's Theatre, the course focused largely on improvised drama, but eventually the curriculum was expanded to include script work and acting for the camera. Performances Stage School Australia also operates as a performing arts company and have been putting on multiple stage productions annually for two decades. Stage School Australia have done seasons of original plays and musicals as well as many theatre classics including; The Conference of the Birds, Godspell, Man of La Mancha, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Oliver!, Rags, Salad Days, Wizard of Oz, Spring Awakening, Seussical TYA, Conference of the Birds, Disney Alice in Wonderland Jr, Disney Aladdin Jr, BABE the Sheep-Pig, Disney The Little Mermaid Jr, The Secret Garden ~ Spring Version, Disney Beauty and the Beast Jr, Honk!

It was the first film for musicians Papanasam Sivan, S. Rajam and Veenai S. Balachander. Artist‚Äôs brush with celluloid (The Hindu 20 March 2009) The film was remade in Telugu in the same year.  Plot  Sita Kalyanam is the story of Sita's (S. Jayalakshmi) swayamvara. Sita's father King Janaka (V. Sundaram Iyer) arranges a swayamvara for his daughter. He announces a contest and declares that whoever can wield Shiva Dhanush (Shiva's bow) will be given Seetha's hand in marriage. After several kings and princes fail to do so, Rama (S.

Shantaram wanted to make a Tamil film using his sets from his 1933 Marathi film Sairandhri. Sairandhri was a financial failure and Shantaram was looking to underwrite its cost by making a Tamil film reusing its sets at Kolhapur. He wrote to Sound and Shadow, a Chennai-based movie magazine asking for help. The people who ran the magazine ‚Äî film directors Murugadasa (Muthuswamy Iyer), A. K. Sekhar, K. Ramnoth, and G. K.

Balachander ‚Äî went to Kolhapur to participate in the new film. The children's music tutor, Papanasam Sivan was hired to write the lyrics for the songs. Shantaram's cousin, Baburao Pendharkar directed the film with K. Ramnoth as his assistant. Remembering Ramnoth The film was later remade in Telugu with a different set of actors, with K. Ramnoth as cinematographer and A. K. Sekhar as art director. The songs were not pre-recorded. They were recorded live on the set with the actors singing them in their own voices, while the orchestra players played their instruments beyond the camera range.

RTR is used to integrate with applications that require reliable transaction services. Description RTR manages the messages sent between client-server to provide node and network fail-over for increased reliability, transactional integrity, and interoperability between dissimilar systems. The RTR software has three logical entities and referred to as front-end (FE), back-end (BE) and transaction-router(TR). The router is a software component that provides the fail-over intelligence and manages connections to the back-end. The client applications running on the Front-End combined with Router and Server applications running on back-end interact to provide transaction integrity and reliability. The three logical entities can exist on the same node but are usually deployed on different nodes to achieve modularity, scalability and high availability. The client application interacts with the front-end which forwards the messages to the router, the router in turn routes the message to the intended back-end where the appropriate Server application is available for processing the message. The RTR routing capability partitions data across multiple servers and nodes for increased performance. Within an application, the partition determines how messages are routed between the client and the servers. The message exchange happens between the client and server. Transactions start at the client and involve many messages that can go to a number of different servers. Such method of messaging is used in situations where there are multiple recipients for a message, or where unsolicited messages need to be sent. RTR can help survive the failures generally seen in distributed application environment which include complete site failure, node failure, network link failure and software process failure. RTR also provides continuous availability by using redundant resources in the distributed environment. RTR provides a Web Interface and a Command Line Interface(CLI) for managing the RTR environment. When RTR and its components are running along with the applications, then Client Application, Server Application, RTR services will be active. RTR is integrated with client applications and can be customized. User and Management Applications can be written using RTR APIs. The C, C++, Java and .Net variants of APIs are available for creating applications to use RTR.  History  RTR was first conceived in Zurich, Switzerland by Dr. Paul Shrager in early 1988, and developed by a small team of four engineers, working for DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation). The initial release was written in a mix of Macro, Bliss, Pascal and SDL on top of DECnet and VMS. Later it was reimplemented in C on top of a TCP/IP stack and an OS agnostic infrastructure, that allowed it to be deployed on multiple operating systems, including various flavors of Unix/Linux, VMS, Windows. A Java and C++ veneer was added in the mid 90s to support a RPC style veneer, on top of the \\"services\\" oriented interface. Special Characteristics RTR was one of the first OLTP middleware services that provided the following features (in addition of the usual ones), viz. * Concurrent servers (a service could be offered by multiple entities, either as multiple threads within the same process, or as independent processes) * Standby servers (a set of services that is capable of offering the services, if required, but not currently being asked to do so) * Shadow servers (a set of services currently processing an identical set of requests as the primary servers) Additionally, RTR guarantees the data equivalence of the repositories behind the primary and shadow servers, by enforcing a deduced \\"dependency relationship\\" among the set of concurrent transactions being shadowed. This allows RTR to process multiple transactions on the shadow without compromising dependency violations. Who uses it? The most high-profile users are banks, stock exchanges and Railway Passenger Reservation Systems. RTR was available on HP-UX, Linux, Windows and OpenVMS in 2010.

Since the fortifications were decommissioned in 1870, the Fortification Ring has been dominated by a number of parks and distinctive greenspaces and it is still maintained and developed as a green belt within the city limits, running between the city centre and the -bro districts. The ramparts, bastions and moats of the former fortifications are still clearly seen in the topography. At Christianshavn and the citadel Kastellet, the fortifications have been preserved and remain intact. History The decommissioning of Copenhagen's fortifications was a lengthy process. Though the four city gates were finally dismantled in 1858-60 to allow for traffic to pass more freely in and out of the city, work on the ramparts continued and it would take another two decades before a denise fell into place. In 1867 a law abolished the demarcation line around the city and in the same time it provided the legislative foundation for the City of Copenhagen, on certain conditions, to take over the extensive areas which the fortifications had occupied till then. When an agreement fell into place in 1868, with effect from 1 January 1870, it stipulated that the City was required to use certain specified areas for green spaces. An area was to be put at the disposal of the University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden and a minimum of 300,000 square ell (12 hectares) were to be laid out as public parks. In addition, a master plan for the redevelopment of the area had to be approved by the State. A master plan for the area was approved in 1872 and ground work proceeded, first at the Northern Rampart. A revision of the master plan in 1885 increased the area to be laid out as parkland to 23.5 hectares. The decommissioning of the Christianshavn Rampart finally followed in 1616.

The U.S. Army faced the Western Confederacy of Native Americans, as part of the Northwest Indian War. It was \\"the most decisive defeat in the history of the American military\\" and its largest defeat ever by Native Americans.http://www.whatitmeanstobeamerican.org/ideas/the-biggest-forgotten- american-indian-victory/ The Native Americans were led by Little Turtle of the Miamis, Blue Jacket of the Shawnees, and Buckongahelas of the Delawares (Lenape). The war party numbered more than 1,000 warriors, including many Potawatomis from eastern Michigan and the Saint Joseph. The opposing force of about 1,000 Americans was led by General Arthur St. Clair. The forces of the American Indian confederacy attacked at dawn, taking St. Clair's men by surprise. Of the 1,000 officers and men that St. Clair led into battle, only 24 escaped unharmed. As a result, President George Washington forced St. Clair to resign his post, and Congress initiated its first investigation of the executive branch. Background In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain recognized United States sovereignty of all the land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes. The native tribes in the Old Northwest, however, were not parties to this treaty and many of them, especially leaders such as Little Turtle and Blue Jacket, refused to recognize American claims to the area northwest of the Ohio River. The young United States government, deeply in debt following the Revolutionary War and lacking the authority to tax under the Articles of Confederation, planned to raise funds via the methodical sale of land in the Northwest Territory. This plan necessarily called for the removal of both Native American villages and squatters.Calloway, 38 During the mid and late 1780s, American settlers in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the river suffered approximately 1,500 deaths during the ongoing hostilities, in which white settlers often retaliated against Indians. The cycle of violence threatened to deter settlement of the newly acquired territory, so John Cleves Symmes and Jonathan Dayton petitioned President Washington and his Secretary of War, Henry Knox, to use military force to crush the Miami.Calloway, 55 A force of 1,453 men (320 regulars from the First American Regiment and 1,133 militia) under Brigadier General Josiah Harmar marched northwards from Fort Washington on the Ohio River at 10:00 a.m. on October 7, 1790. The campaign ended in disaster for the United States. On October 19-22, near Kekionga (present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana), Harmar committed detachments that were ambushed by Native American forces defending their own territory. On three separate occasions, Harmar failed to reinforce the detachments. Suffering heavy losses, Harmar ordered a retreat back to Ft. Washington. At least 129 of Hardin's soldiers (14 officers, 115 enlisted) were killed in action and another 94 wounded, for a total of 223 casualties. Estimates of total Native casualties, killed and wounded, range from 120 to 150. President George Washington then ordered General Arthur St. Clair, who served both as governor of the Northwest Territory and as a major general in the Army, to mount a more vigorous effort by summer 1791. Congress agreed to raise a second regiment of Regular soldiers for six months, but it later reduced soldiers' pay. The demoralized First Regiment was soon reduced to 299 soldiers, while the new Second Regiment was able to recruit only half of its authorized soldiers. St. Clair was forced to augment his Army with Kentucky militia as well as two regiments (five battalions) of six-month levies.  Command structure  The final command structure was as follows:Winkler, 18-21 US Army - Major General Arthur St. Clair * 1st Infantry Regiment - Major Jean Fran√ßois Hamtramck (only part of the regiment under Captain Thomas Doyle was engaged) * 2nd Infantry Regiment - Major Jonathan Hart [killed] * Artillery Battalion - Major William Ferguson [killed] US levies - Major General Richard Butler [killed] * 1st Levy Regiment - Lieutenant Colonel William Darke * 2nd Levy Regiment - Lieutenant Colonel George Gibson Kentucky militia - Lieutenant Colonel William Oldham [Killed] Campaign lithograph of Little Turtle is reputedly based upon a lost portrait by Gilbert Stuart that was destroyed when the British burned Washington in 1814.Carter, Life and Times, 62‚Äì3. Washington was adamant for St. Clair to move north in the summer months, but various logistics and supply problems greatly slowed his preparations in Fort Washington (now Cincinnati, Ohio). The new recruits were poorly trained and disciplined, the food supplies were substandard, and the horses were not only low in number, but also of poor quality. The expedition thus failed to set out until October 1791. Building supply posts as it advanced, the Army's objective was the town of Kekionga, the capital of the Miami tribe, near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana. The Army under St. Clair included 600 regulars, 800 six-month conscripts, and 600 militia at its peak, a total of around 2,000 men.Allison, 81 Desertion took its toll and when the force finally got underway, it had dwindled to around 1,486 total men and some 200-250 camp followers (wives, children, laundresses, and prostitutes). Going was slow and discipline problems were severe; St. Clair, suffering from gout, had difficulty maintaining order, especially among the militia and the new levies. The force was constantly shadowed by Indians and skirmishes occasionally erupted. By the end of November 2, through further desertion and illness, St. Clair's force had been whittled down to around 1,120, including the camp followers. He had 52 officers and 868 enlisted and militia present for duty on November 3. The force camped on an elevated meadow, but did not construct any defensive works, even though natives had been seen in the forest.Allison, 82 While St. Clair's Army continued to lose soldiers, the Western Confederacy quickly added numbers. Buckongahelas led his 480 men to join the 700 warriors of Little Turtle and Blue Jacket, bringing the war party to more than one thousand warriors, including many Potawatomis from eastern Michigan and the Saint Joseph.

On the evening of 3 November, St. Clair's force established a camp on a high hill near the present-day location of Fort Recovery, Ohio, near the headwaters of the Wabash River. A native force consisting of around 1,000 warriors, led by Little Turtle and Blue Jacket, waited in the woods until dawn, when the men stacked their weapons and paraded to their morning meals. Adjutant General Winthrop Sargent had just reprimanded the militia for failing to conduct reconnaissance patrols when the natives struck, surprising the Americans and overrunning their ground. Little Turtle directed the first attack at the militia, who fled across a stream without their weapons. The regulars immediately broke their musket stacks, formed battle lines and fired a volley into the natives, forcing them back.Allison, 83 Little Turtle responded by flanking the regulars and closing in on them. Meanwhile, St. Clair's artillery was stationed on a nearby bluff and was wheeling into position when the gun crews were killed by native marksmen, and the survivors were forced to spike their guns. Colonel William Darke ordered his battalion to fix bayonets and charge the main native position. Little Turtle's forces gave way and retreated to the woods, only to encircle Darke's battalion and destroy it.Allison, 84 The bayonet charge was tried numerous times with similar results and the U.S. forces eventually collapsed in disorder. St. Clair had three horses shot out from under him as he tried in vain to rally his men. After three hours of fighting, St. Clair called together the remaining officers and, faced with total annihilation, decided to attempt one last bayonet charge to get through the native line and escape. Supplies and wounded were left in camp. As before, Little Turtle's Army allowed the bayonets to pass through, but this time the men ran for Fort Jefferson.Allison, 85 They were pursued by Indians for about three miles before the latter broke off pursuit and returned to loot the camp. Exact numbers of wounded are not known, but it has been reported that execution fires burned for several days afterwards. The casualty rate was the highest percentage ever suffered by a United States Army unit and included St. Clair's second in command, Richard Butler. Of the 52 officers engaged, 39 were killed and 7 wounded; around 88% of all officers had become casualties. After two hours St. Clair ordered a retreat, which quickly turned into a rout. \\"It was, in fact, a flight,\\" St. Clair described a few days later in a letter to the Secretary of War. The American casualty rate among the soldiers, was 97.4 percent, including 632 of 920 killed (69%) and 264 wounded. Nearly all of the 200 camp followers were slaughtered, for a total of 832 Americans killed. Approximately one-quarter of the entire U.S. Army had been wiped out. Only 24 of the 920 officers and men engaged came out of it unscathed. The survivors included Benjamin Van Cleve and his uncle Robert Benham; van Cleve was one the few who were unharmed. Native casualties were about 61, with at least 21 killed. The number of U.S. soldiers killed during this engagement was more than three times the number the Sioux would kill 85 years later at the Battle of Little Big Horn. Historian William Hogeland calls it \\"the high-water mark in resistance to white expansion. No comparable Indian victory would follow.\\" The next day the remnants of the force arrived at the nearest U.S. outpost, Fort Jefferson, and from there returned to Fort Washington.Casualty statistics from \\"That Dark and Bloody River\\", by Allan W. Eckert, Bantam Books, December 1995. Aftermath Native American response The confederacy reveled in their triumph and war trophies, but most members of the force returned to their respective towns after the victory. The 1791 harvest had been insufficient in the region, and the warriors needed to hunt to have enough food stores for winter.Sword, 196 A grand council was held on the banks of the Ottawa River to determine whether to continue the war against the United States or negotiate a peace from a strong position. The council delayed the final decision until a new grand council could be held the following year. Both Little Turtle and Blue Jacket claimed to have been in overall command of the native forces at the victory, causing resentment between the two men and their followers.Calloway, 459 British response The British, surprised and delighted at the success of the natives they have been supporting and arming for years, stepped up their plans to create a pro-British Indian barrier state that would be closed to further settlement and encompass what was then known as the Northwest Territory, which spanned the American Midwestern region from Ohio into Minnesota. The plans were developed in Canada, but in 1794, the government in London reversed course and decided it was necessary to gain American favor since a major war had broken out with France. London put the barrier state idea on hold and opened friendly negotiations with the Americans that led to the Jay Treaty of 1794. One provision was that the British acceded to American demands to remove their forts from American territory in Michigan and Wisconsin. The British, however, maintained their forts in Ontario from which they supplied munitions to the Natives living in the United States.Dwight L. Smith, \\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\\" Northwest Ohio Quarterly 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63 American response Fort Jefferson did not have adequate supplies for the remaining force under St. Clair, so those who could travel continued their retreat. Many wounded were left behind with no medicine and little food.Sword, 193 St. Clair sent a supply convoy and a hundred soldiers under Major David Zieglerfrom Fort Washington on November 11.Sword, 194 He arrived at Fort Jefferson and found 116 survivors eating \\"horse flesh and green hides\\".Sword, 199 Charles Scott organized a relief party of Kentucky militia, but it disbanded at Fort Washington in late November with no action taken. Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson assumed command of the Second Regiment in January 1792 and led a supply convoy to Fort Jefferson. The detachment attempted to bury the dead and collect the missing cannons, but the task proved to be beyond it, with \\"upwards of six hundred bodies\\" at the battle site and at least 78 bodies along the road.Gaff, 11 Washington was outraged when he received news of the defeat.Schecter, 238 After cursing St. Clair, he told Tobias Lear, \\"General St. Clair shall have justice. I looked hastily through the dispatches, saw the whole disaster but not all the particulars.\\"Hogeland, 151 St. Clair left Wilkinson in charge of Fort Washington and arrived in Philadelphia in January 1792 to report on what had happened. Blaming the quartermaster, Samuel Hodgdon, as well as the War Department, the general asked for a court-martial in order to gain exoneration and planned to resign his commission after winning it. Washington, however, denied him the court-martial and forced St. Clair's immediate resignation. The House of Representatives began its own investigation into the disaster. It was the first Congressional Special Committee investigation as well as the first investigation of the executive branch. As part of the proceedings, the House committee in charge of the investigation sought certain documents from the War Department. Knox brought that matter to Washington's attention and because of the major issues of separation of powers involved, the president summoned a meeting of all of his department heads. It was one of the first meetings of all of the officials together and may be considered the beginning of the United States Cabinet. Washington established, in principle, the position that the executive branch should refuse to divulge any papers or materials that the public good required it to keep secret and that at any rate, it was not to provide any originals. That is the earliest appearance of the doctrine of executive privilege, which later became a major separation of powers issue. The final committee report sided largely with St. Clair by finding that Knox, Quartermaster General Samuel Hodgdon, and other War Department officials had done a poor job of raising, equipping, and supplying St. Clair's expedition. However, Congress voted against a motion to consider the Committee's findings and issued no final report. St. Clair expressed disappointment that his reputation was not officially cleared. Within weeks of learning of the disaster, Washington wrote, \\"We are involved in actual war!\\"Sword, 203‚Äì205 He urged Congress to raise an army capable of conducting a successful offense against the American Indian confederacy, which it did in March 1792 by establishing additional army regiments (the Legion of the United States), adding three-year enlistments, and increasing military pay. That May, it also passed two Militia Acts. The first empowered the president to call out the militias of the several states. The second required free able-bodied white male citizens of the various states between the ages of 18 and 45 to enroll in the militia of the state in which they resided. Washington would use the authority to call out the militia in 1794 to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania. In late 1793, Major General \\"Mad Anthony\\" Wayne led 300 men from the Legion to the site of St. Clair's defeat. On December 25, they identified the site because of the large amount of unburied remains. Private George Will wrote that to setup camp, the unit had to move bones to make space for their beds. The Legion quickly built Fort Recovery and spent the following months reinforcing the structure and searching for the abandoned artillery from St. Clair's defeat. On 30 June to 1 July 1794, the Legion successfully defended the fort from a Native American attack. The next month, the Legion won a decisive victory in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The following year, the United States and the Native confederacy negotiated the Treaty of Greenville, which used Fort Recovery as a reference point for the boundary between American and Native settlements. The treaty is considered to be the conclusion to the Northwest Indian War. In popular culture A story was published years after the defeat of St Clair about a skeleton of a Captain Roger Vanderberg and his diary that were supposedly found inside a tree in Miami County, Ohio. However, no one of that name was a casualty of the 1791 battle. The story originated in 1864 and was actually taken from a Scottish novel. A folk ballad, \\"St. Clair's Defeat\\" (or \\"Sinclair's Defeat\\"), was published in the 19th century; Anne Grimes' quotes Recollections of Persons and Places in the West by Henry M. Brackenridge, 1834, in which Brackenridge recalled hearing the song from its author, a blind poet named Dennis Loughey, at a racetrack in Pittsburgh around 1800. It was collected as a folksong in Mary O. Eddy's 1939 book Ballads and Songs from Ohio.

She is a social activist, focusing on public health. Education Born in Barcelona in 1966, Forcades grew up in a home where her parents rejected religion. She was sent, however, to the private Sacred Heart school, where she discovered religious faith through the study of the Bible given by the religious sisters who ran the school. She went on to study medicine at the University of Barcelona. In 1992 she moved to the United States, where in 1995 she completed a residency at the University of Buffalo School of Medicine, specialising in internal medicine. After obtaining a scholarship, she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she gained the degree of Master of Divinity from Harvard Divinity School in 1997. As the result of a stay in order to prepare for some examinations which Forcades made at the Monastery of St. Benedict in Montserrat, Spain, founded in 1952, and connected to the famed Abbey of Santa Maria de Montserrat, she felt a call to monastic life. In September 1997, she entered the monastery, where she follows the Benedictine pattern of life, while still working in the fields of religious study, theology and medicine. In 2004 she obtained a doctorate in public health from the University of Barcelona . In 2005 she obtained a degree in theology. After four years, in 2009 she received a doctorate from the School of Theology of Catalonia. Positions Teresa Forcades understands feminism as a form of liberation theology. Forcades has openly criticised the Catholic church as \\"misogynist and patriarchal in its structure\\". She has developed her thoughts on this in the light of liberation theology. In 2013, Forcades co-authored the Manifesto for the Convening of a Constituent Process in Catalonia with economist . In it they proposed achieving independence for Catalonia through new political and social model based on self-organisation and social mobilisation. Her political activism resulted in The Guardian labelling her as \\"one of the most outspoken ... leaders of southern Europe's far left\\". In 2015, as another major vote for Catalan independence approached, Forcades received permission from her superior and the Holy See to set aside her habit and don secular attire, entering the political arena to lead the leftist Proc√©s Constituent movement. She remarked, \\"Criticisms are to be expected. I follow somebody called Jesus and he had a lot of that.\\" In 2018, she returned to the monastery of Sant Benet in Montserrat to resume her life as a contemplative nun.

The picture was taken on Burgh Marsh, situated near Burgh by Sands, overlooking the Solway Firth in Cumbria, England. Templeton claimed the photograph shows a background figure wearing a space suit and insisted that he did not see anyone present when the photograph was taken. The image was reproduced widely in contemporary newspapers and gained the interest of ufologists. A contemporary analysis concluded that the figure was the photographer's wife, standing with her back towards the camera, her dress appearing white due to overexposure. Photograph On 23 May 1964, Jim Templeton, a firefighter from Carlisle, Cumberland (now part of Cumbria), took three photographs of his five-year-old daughter while on a day trip to Burgh Marsh. Templeton said the only other people on the marshes that day were a couple of old women sitting in a car at the far end of the marsh. In a letter to the Daily Mail in 2002, Templeton stated, \\"I took three pictures of my daughter Elizabeth in a similar pose ‚Äì and was shocked when the middle picture came back from Kodak displaying what looks like a spaceman in the background.\\" Templeton insists that he did not see the figure until after his photographs were developed, and analysts at Kodak confirmed that the photograph was genuine. Explanation of the \\"spaceman\\" According to UFO author David Clarke in 2014, the \\"spaceman\\" is most likely Templeton's wife, Annie, who was present at the time and was seen on other photographs taken that day. \\"I think for some reason his wife walked into the shot and he didn't see her because with that particular make of camera you could only see 70% of what was in the shot through the viewfinder\\", said Clarke. Annie Templeton was wearing a pale blue dress on the day in question, which was overexposed as white in the other photos; she also had dark bobbed hair. It has been argued that, when using photo software to darken the image and straighten the horizon, the figure increasingly appears to be a regular person viewed from behind. Of its impact, Clarke said: \\"People will still be talking about it in another 50 years.\\" Publicity Templeton stated, \\"I took the picture to the police in Carlisle who, after many doubts, examined it and stated there was nothing suspicious about it. The local newspaper, the Cumberland News, picked up the story and within hours it was all over the world. The picture is certainly not a fake, and I am as bemused as anyone else as to how this figure appeared in the background. Over the four decades the photo has been in the public domain, I have had many thousands of letters from all over the world with various ideas or possibilities ‚Äì most of which make little sense to me.\\" Templeton said that after the photograph was published he was visited by two men who said they were from the government who refused to show their identification and that \\"They said they worked for the government and that they were only identified by number.\\" After taking the men to the site where the photos were taken, Templeton said that when he explained he had not seen the figure at the time, the men became angry and drove away, leaving him to walk home. In September 1964, Templeton dismissed the two men as frauds, saying: \\"It all looks like a leg pull to me. I'm sure the men were not security agents.\\" In a BBC Look North interview and a letter to The Daily Mail, Templeton also said that a Blue Streak missile launch at the Woomera Test Range in South Australia had been aborted because the figures of two large men were seen on the firing range. He alleged that technicians later saw his photograph in an Australian newspaper and found the figures to be exactly the same. Responding to a request from ufologists to know if the photo was of interest to the authorities, a British Ministry of Defence official said that the Templeton photo was of no interest to them.

When Vijaya, the first recorded ruler of the country arrived from India, he brought a large retinue of his followers with him. These followers spread throughout the country, and established settlements. One of his chief followers named Vijitha founded the establishment which was then known as Vijitha Nagara (city of Vijitha) or Vijithagama (village of Vijitha). The city is believed to have been founded during the reign of king Panduvasudeva, the third recorded king of Sri Lanka, who was the brother in law of the chieftain Vijitha. The city is mentioned again in the chronicles Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa, Rajavaliya and Thupavamsa nearly 300 years later during the reign of king Dutthagamani. The city is then a highly fortified stronghold of Ellalan, against whom Dutthagamani had launched a military campaign. The Thupavamsa mentions that it was defended by three moats and a high wall. The wall had four gates made of wrought iron on the north, south, east and west. The Rajavaliya describes Vijithapura as a fortress second only to the then capital city of Anuradhapura. Dutthagamani's army laid siege on the city for four months before finally capturing it through simultaneous attacks on all four gates. After this, there is no more mention of Vijithapura in the ancient chronicles. However, historians believe that the city may have been an important trade center during the early stages of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, connecting several trade routes. The exact location of the city is uncertain. However, a modern village with the same name exists near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir, which may be the location of ancient Vijithapura. There is an ancient temple here as well as a granite stone that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords before their battle. Other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.

He painted many subjects and was particularly known as an animalier and portrait painter.Max Rooses, Oude en nieuwe kunst, pp. 45-99 He also created Orientalist works, genre scenes, including a number of singeries, religious compositions and still lifes. He was a professor of drawing and director of the Antwerp Academy when Vincent van Gogh spent a brief period as a student at the Academy in 1886. The two men got into arguments about van Gogh's unconventional style of drawing.Steven Naifeh, Gregory White Smith, Van Gogh: The Life, Random House Publishing Group, 18 October 2011, pp. 448-489 Life He was born in Antwerp as the son of a manufacturer of soap, oil and soda. His mother arranged for the young Charles to get his first drawing classes from the Dutch sculptor Johannes Antonius van der Ven, who was then studying at the Antwerp Academy. From an early age he lived for art. He left formal school education at the early age of fourteen and was accepted together with Godfried Guffens to take lessons at the private studio located in the Vleeshuis of Nicaise de Keyser. De Keyser was one of the key figures in the Belgian Romantic-historical school of painting. At the time de Keyser had about 30 pupils including some who came to prominence such as Edouard Hamman, Jan Swerts, Joseph Lies and Johan Bernard Wittkamp. At the same time he followed the courses at the Antwerp Academy where he studied, among others with Gustave Wappers and Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. Saved in the nick of time He started participating in the salons of his time and send in 1843 his first important picture, Pippin the Short Killing a Lion to the Antwerp triennial salon. His first paintings were inspired by the Belgian Romantic school and treated important events from Belgian history. He also gradually started to paint animal scenes as well as genre scenes. In 1849 he painted his first religious composition which was intended for the St Gummarus church in Lier. He participated in the Prix de Rome of Belgium in 1847 but was not successful, possible as the result of his partial incapacitation due to a broken arm. Fortunately, a wealthy relative called Albert Marnef van Wespelaer provided him in 1849 with a stipend that allowed him to continue his studies for four years. Musical monkeys He left for Paris in 1850 and studied there first in the studio of the Dutch painter Ary Scheffer. Later he studied with Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. From 1852 he had his own studio in Paris. He gained commissions from religious and official institutions in Belgium including the commission from the Antwerp city government for the large historical composition Godefroid de Bouillon during the assault on Jerusalem (1854, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium). In 1855 he won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle at Paris with his Tiger Attacking a Herd of Buffaloes. He gradually came under the influence of the Realism of Gustave Courbet. This resulted in his 1857 work Coup de collier (now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp) showing two horses struggling to pull a heavy cart loaded with bricks while being whipped by their handlers. Despite its vivid depiction and dynamic form, the large-scale work failed to achieve the success its creator had hoped for. When he exhibited it at the 1857 Paris Salon the work was mocked in the French magazine Le Charivari with a cartoon showing men helping to push a very heavy cart out of the Salon and the text \\"Le public poussant √† la roue pour aider la charrette √† sortir de l‚ÄôExposition de peinture\\" (The public pushing the wheel to help the cart leave the painting exhibition).Le Salon de 1857 illustr√© par Cham, La librairie nouvelle, Boulevard des Italiens 15 et au bureau du Journal Le Charivari, 16 Rue du croissant, Paris, 1857 The work was also sharply criticized by Le Figaro's art critic Jean Rousseau who wrote that the work only was good enough for use as a shop sign for a removal company. Verlat took revenge by painting a monkey shaving itself while wiping its feet on the copy of the newspaper in which the criticism had been published. He returned for a year to Antwerp to return the next year to work in his studio in Paris. During this time he started to establish a reputation as an animal painter. He also painted religious subjects and his Piet√† of 1866 was so successful that it earned him the distinction of being appointed a knight in the French Legion of Honour. Piet√† In 1869 he left Paris to take up the invitation of Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach to establish a painting class at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School set up by the Grand Duke. Max Liebermann was one of his students in his painting class.Hendrik Ziegler, Weimar beginnings: Liebermann and Munk√°csy, In: Deshmukh, Marion ; Forster-Hahn, Fran√ßoise ; Gaehtgens, Barbara (Hrsgg.): Max Liebermann and international modernism. An artist's career from Empire to Third Reich. New York ; Oxford 2011, pp. 21-33 He was very appreciated by the Grand Duke and taught art classes to the daughters of the Grand Duke. He became later the acting head of the Art School. The Grand Duke also bestowed on him the Order of the White Falcon. During this period he was active as a portrait painter. He moved in the cultural circles of Weimar and was friends with Franz Liszt whose portrait he painted. They would stay in touch and later Verlat would be instrumental in Liszt's visit to Antwerp in 1881. Portrait of Princess Sophie of the Netherlands In August 1875 Verlat left his official positions in Weimar and traveled to Cairo where he stayed for six months. He then moved on to Jerusalem where he would reside for two years. He traveled throughout Palestine and painted the people, animals and landscapes. He seems to have been motivated by a desire to study the real life of the people who formed the subjects of his religious paintings. His major creations during this time included large-scale religious compositions Vox populi (1876, St. Lawrence Church, Alkmaar), Vox Dei (1877, Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp), The Tomb of Christ and The Flight into Egypt. Verlat returned to Antwerp in 1877. He exhibited the paintings he created in Palestine in various locations, including in Weimar, Antwerp, Brussels and London. They were also sent to the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. The works were received with enthusiasm. He had been called to Antwerp to take up the position of professor of painting at the Antwerp Academy which had become vacant with the death of Jozef Van Lerius. He was also offered a seat on the board of the Academy to replace Nicaise de Keyser upon his retirement. When Nicaise de Keyser resigned in 1879, Verlat decided to let his old teacher Joseph Geefs take up the role. As a result, Verlat only became a member of the board in 1885. In 1881 he was made Commander in the Order of Leopold.Het Handelsblad of 15 May 1881 Vox Dei At the time, panoramic paintings, large artworks that show a wide, all- encompassing view of a particular subject such as a landscape, military battle or other historical event, were all the rage in Europe. Verlat also created a few panoramic paintings. In Antwerp he first created the Battle of Waterloo in 1881. This work was 120 meters wide and 10 meters high. The whole scene also included plaster figures that enlivened the experience. The next year he created for a Russian organisation another panorama showing a Review of the Russian soldiers after the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano before Constantinopel. He executed this work with the assistance of his pupils. In 1883 he was commissioned with decorating the stairwell of the Antwerp City Hall. Of the four historical paintings he planned to install only one showing The Duke of Alva's statue dragged through the streets of Antwerp was finished at the time of his death. During this period he made many portraits, animal paintings, religious compositions and decorations for the palace of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders in Brussels. The unfortunate cat In January 1886 the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh matriculated in painting and drawing at the Antwerp Academy. He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with Verlat, the then director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class Franz Vinck. Verlat organised for van Gogh to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by Eug√®ne Siberdt. Soon Siberdt and van Gogh also came into conflict and there was a confrontation between the two men when van Gogh made a drawing after the Venus of Milo making her look like the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Van Gogh ceased to attend classes after the confrontation. On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.Jan Lampo, In het Spoor van de Academie ‚Äì persbericht Verlat taught many other international pupils at the Academy including the illustrator Joseph Finnemore, Joseph Malachy Kavanagh and John Duncan.Robert Scholes, Finnemore, Joseph (1860-1939)Gallery of Original Art featuring Joseph Malachy Kavanagh Although he was hard-working and his works commanded a high price in the market, Verlat became indebted because of the high costs of organizing exhibitions of his works, the creation of the panorama's and a big loss on the Russian panorama, which was never paid. As a result, he was pursued by his creditors and had to pawn his works despite the financial assistance of his powerful friends. Verlat also became involved in the reorganisation of art education in Antwerp and the establishment of the Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten (Higher Institute for the Arts) which was to take over some of the tasks of art education in Antwerp. It had the effect of diminishing the role of the Academy of Antwerp and of its director Verlat. He tried to maintain a more important role for the Academy but was only partially successful. In the controversy that ensued, he made many enemies. All of these troubles were a serious burden on the artist. His health declined and in 1890 he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. Unable to regain his strength he died in Antwerp on 23 October 1890. He was buried two days later on the Kielkerhof and a bust created by his friend Jules Pecher was placed on the tomb. Work Verlat was a versatile artist who practised painting, watercolor and etching. He also was an avid draughtsman. His subject matter was wide-ranging and included animal paintings, portraits, religious compositions, Orientalist works, genre scenes, including a number of singeries, and some still lifes. He was initially influenced by the professors of the Antwerp Academy who were important proponents of the Belgian Romantic school and preached a return to the glorious Flemish Baroque style to treat important events in Belgium's history. He was later influenced by other contemporary art movements: the German Idealists whom he knew through Ary Scheffer in Paris and the Realism of Gustave Courbet. During his stay in Palestine his palette became muted and lost its Flemish bluster. Despite these many influences, his main inspiration was the work of the Flemish Baroque masters Rubens, van Dyck and Jordaens. He regained his more colorful palette after his return to Antwerp. The defense of the herd During his lifetime he was recognised as an important animal painter. He was able to render animals in a lively and Realist manner. One of his early animal works was acquired by the English animal painter Edwin Landseer. One of the best known examples of his art in this area is The defense of the herd (1878, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). Painted during his Palestine residence it has the muted palette that he adopted during this period. It shows the kind of dynamic representation of animals only interactions that can be seen in the animal paintings of earlier Flemish animaliers such as Frans Snyders. Verlat painted many works in the genre of the singeries, i.e. humoristic renderings of monkeys engaging in human activities. The monkeys in the scenes are often dressed in costumes which adds comedy to their 'aping' of a specific human action (often a vice such as smoking or gambling) or occupation such as art critic, dentist, painter, musician etc. He created some original etchings in the early 1880s, including a self-portrait.Charles Verlat at the British Museum He worked directly on the plate without other preparation which gives these works a spontaneous feel.

Later it moved to Singapore, Colombo (Ceylon), Kilindini (Kenya), then returned to Colombo. Hong Kong The FECB was located in an office block in the Naval dockyard, with an armed guard at the door (which negated any attempt at secrecy). The intercept site was on Stonecutters Island, four miles across the harbour, and manned by a dozen RAF and RN ratings (plus later four Army signallers). The codebreaking or Y section had Japanese, Chinese and Russian interpreters, under RN Paymaster Arthur (Harry) Shaw, with Dick Thatcher and Neil Barnham. The FECB was headed by the Chief of Intelligence Staff (COIS) Captain John Waller, later by Captain F. J. Wylie. Shaw had been dealing direct with GC&CS; and the C-in-C Far East in Shanghai, but found that Waller expected that everything should go through him, and paid little regard to keeping sources secret. So by 1936 the two most senior naval officers were barely on speaking terms. Colonel Valentine Burkhart found when he arrived in 1936 that the bureau was involved in ‚Äúturf wars‚Äù, although they eventually accepted that they had no control over the use of intelligence reports. Initially the Y section was to focus on the three main Japanese Navy codes and cyphers; the Japanese Naval General Cypher, the Flag Officer code and the \\"tasogare\\" or basic naval reporting code used to report the sailings of individual ships. In 1938 a section was set up to attack Japanese commercial systems and so to track supply convoys. From 1936 many messages were sent back to London, to be deciphered by John Tiltman, who broke the first version of JN-25 in 1939.Smith (2001) pp 130-133  Singapore  In August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of war with Germany, the FECB moved to Singapore on HMS Birmingham for fear of Japanese attack. A skeleton staff of a codebreaker (Alf Bennett) and four intercept operators were left at Hong Kong, and they were captured by the Japanese on Christmas Day 1941. FECB went to Seletar Naval Base, and the intercept station to Kranji. An RAF \\"Y\\" interception unit, 52 Wireless Unit, arrived in Singapore in early November 1941.Smith (2000) page 95 As Bletchley Park was concentrating on German Enigma cyphers, many of the Japanese naval section in Hut 7 moved to FECB, Singapore. By May 1940 there were forty people working solely on JN-25, who could read simple messages. The new codebook JN-25B was introduced on 1 December 1940, but was broken immediately as the additives were not changed.Smith (2000) page 79 There was interchange with Station CAST at Corregidor, which was better placed to intercept IJN messages, as FECB could only receive the Combined Fleet in home waters at night. FECB also collaborated with the US Army Station 6 intercept site at Fort McKinley near Manila. FECB was sent one of the American Purple machines from Bletchley Park in a warship. Supposed to be sent only by warship or military transport, it was trans-shipped at Durban to the freighter Sussex. The ship's Master said he landed it at the Naval Store Singapore at the end of December 1941, but the Naval Stores Officer denied any knowledge of it; hopefully it was destroyed or dumped in the sea. But the Hollerith tabulating machine (minus a key part, which had to borrowed from the Indian State Railways in Bombay) arrived safely in Colombo.Smith (2000) page 105-107 FECB also cooperated with Kamer 14 (Room 14), the Dutch unit at the Bandung Technical College in Java. Initially some of the FECB people went there after the fall of Singapore.Smith (2000) page 106 & (2001) pp133-138 Lieutenant-Commander Leo Brouwer RNN, a Japanese linguist at Kamer 14 was evacuated to Colombo, then Kilindini, and later Hut 7. Colombo, Ceylon With the Japanese advance down the Malay Peninsula, the Army and RAF codebreakers went to the Wireless Experimental Centre in Delhi, India. The RN codebreakers went to Colombo, Ceylon in January 1942, on the troopship HMS Devonshire (with 12 codebreakers' cars as deck cargo). Pembroke College, an Indian boys school, was requisitioned as a combined codebreaking and wireless interception centre. The FECB worked for Admiral Sir James Somerville, commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy's Eastern Fleet. Initially the Bureau wanted to move to Australia, but were reportedly told by the Director of Signals Communication, Lieutenant Commander Jack B. Newman that facilities were not available. Many have since been baffled why they were told that), though Newman \\"had no intention of letting the British arrive and run the show\\"; they wanted to commandeer all Australia's intercept stations for their own use. Kilindini, Kenya In April 1942 most of the RN codebreakers at Colombo moved to Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya, because of a Japanese task force attack on Colombo. Two codebreakers and the civilian wireless operators were left in Colombo. An Indian boys school at Allidina about a mile outside Mombasa and overlooking the Indian Ocean was requisitioned, hence the name HMS Allidina.coastweek.com Radio reception was even worse than at Colombo, with only the strongest Japanese signals received. In addition, FRUMEL - the US-Australian-British unit based in Melbourne that replaced CAST - was reluctant to exchange material. The American commander Rudolph Fabian was a difficult man to work with, was prejudiced against the British and had a personality clash with Eric Nave (although Nave was Australian, he was a Royal Navy officer). There were also complaints about Fabian and FRUMEL from MacArthur's headquarters, although MacArthur was not particularly concerned (see also Central Bureau). But in September 1942 Kilindini was able to break the Japanese Merchant Shipping Code (JN-40), because a message was sent twice with extra data. It was a transposition cypher, not a super-enciphered code like JN-25. They also broke JN-152 a simple transposition and substitution cypher for navigation warnings and the previously impenetrable JN-167, another merchant shipping cypher.Smith (2000) page 195 & (2001) pp140-143 These successes enabled Allied forces e.g. submarines to attack Japanese supply ships, and resulted in the Japanese merchant marine suffering 90 per cent losses by August 1945. Return to Colombo FECB then moved back to Colombo; the move began in August 1943, with the advance party arriving in Ceylon on 1 September. Eight Wren Typex operators were killed in February 1944, when their ship the Khedive Ismail en route from Kenya to Ceylon was sunk by a Japanese submarine. The location chosen was the Anderson Golf Course six miles from Colombo HQ, hence the name HMS Anderson. Bruce Keith had wanted an up-country site for better reception, but the Chief of Intelligence staff for HQ Eastern Fleet insisted that the codebreakers should be within easy reach of headquarters. While reception was better than at Kilindini, it was affected by a nearby 33 Kv power line and the Racecourse Aerodrome.  Arthur Shaw  Paymaster Arthur (Harry) Shaw was a Royal Navy codebreaker at the FECB on Hong Kong and then Singapore. He founded the FECB, and headed the diplomatic section. His rank was Paymaster Captain, later Lieutenant Commander.

Musical History The Mist He began his career in 1988 playing bass for the Brazilian thrash metal band The Mist, who had just changed their name from Mayhem following a number of line-up changes. On their first album Phantasmagoria released in 1989, they most notably featured Chakal singer Vladimir Korg on vocals and boasted a twin guitar line-up displaying a progressive mix of aggressive thrash and gothic atmosphere. For their second album, 1991's The Hangman Tree, former Sepultura guitarist Jairo Guedz took over full guitar duties for the band, reducing the band to a four-piece whilst further expanding the unique sound of the debut. Vocalist Korg left after the second album, further reducing the line-up to a trio for which Marcelo took over vocal duties for their third album, Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust released in 1993 which showed the band adopting a more contemporary groove-metal sound. Following this release, Marcelo left the band and was replaced by Cassiano Gobbet on both bass and vocals for their final album, 1995's Gottverlassen before splitting in 1997. Soulfly Following this, Marcelo Dias (a.k.a. Marcello D. Rapp) found international fame as the former bass player for the heavy metal veteran band Soulfly.

It is one of the 20 public primary teachers colleges in Kenya and among the last five of such institutions constructed in the late 1980s by the government of Kenya through the support of the World Bank. The college is situated in the Kerio escarpment section of Elgeyo-Marakwet County along the Eldoret-Kabarnet road. The college is 43 km from Eldoret and 11 km from Iten, the District Headquarters. The college opened its doors to the first batch of 372 students in September 1991. These comprised nine classes, six of the P1 grade, two of P2 and one of P3 grade. Since 1996, the college has been training only P1 students.  History  Teacher training at Tambach started in the 1940s. The course was offered at what was then known as Government African School Tambach at the site of the present day Tambach High School, which was started in 1928. The college then trained teachers of T3 and T4 grades. It was here that the retired President Daniel Arap Moi served as a tutor and head of the institution between 1948 and 1955 when he left teaching to join the colonial legislative council following his election as the council's Rift Valley representative. In 1957, the name of the institution was changed to Tambach Training College. In 1964, the college was amalgamated with Mosoriot Teachers College following the recommendations of the Ominde Education Commission on Teachers Training. Tambach, therefore, ceased to be a Teachers' college and gave way to be the first form one class intake that marked the beginning of the present day Tambach high school. The school still uses many of the former college buildings including staff houses. Among latter is the one that former President Moi lived in.  Facilities  Today the World Bank-funded and Chinese-constructed Teachers College standing on an escarpment land boasts a magnificent two storey, star-shaped complex. To the right as one gets to the complex is a 1,000-capacity multipurpose Theater Hall. Within the college complex are 18 classrooms, two science laboratories, two home science rooms (for serving and cooking), art and craft and agriculture workshops, a seminar room and an ICT laboratory. There is also a learning resource centre (L.R.C) which contains a library, a teaching aids display room, and three audio visual rooms, one of which is a complete studio. The administration block, at the entrance of the complex has several offices and a board room on the ground floor. On the first floor are workrooms for the members of the teaching staff. On both sides of the complex are hostels for men and women. Large students' common rooms are attached to each of the sets of hostels which are separated by a dining hall and a kitchen. The staff quarters are some 300 meters away. These comprise 13 three-bedroom, 26 two- bedroom mansions, and two long flats of six two-bedroom apartments. Between the staff quarters and the main complex is a football pitch complete with a race track. Beside it is a store-cum-parking bay for the college vehicles.  Principals  Since its inception, the college has been under the administration of four principals. * Mr. Nathaniel Chepkener: 1991 to 1998 * Mr. Elias Komen: September 1998 to December 1998 * Mr. Paul Ngetich: 1999 to Jan 2006 * Mr. John C.A.

Her only child was Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, the favourite of King Richard II of England. In 1404 in Essex, she took part in a conspiracy against King Henry IV of England and was sent to the Tower of London; however, she was eventually pardoned through the efforts of Queen consort Joanna of Navarre.Linda Clark, Authority and Subversion, p.35, Google Books, retrieved on 5 November 2009 She resided in the village of Great Bentley in Essex.  Family  Maud was born in Ireland sometime in about 1345 or 1346. Her parents were Sir Ralph de Ufford, Justiciar of Ireland and Maud of Lancaster, widow of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster. Maud was their only child and heiress, although she had a uterine half-sister, Elizabeth de Burgh, who was the suo jure Countess of Ulster. On 9 April 1346, Maud's father died in Kilmainham. Sir Ralph had been an incompetent Justiciar, and was disliked by the Irish.Eleanor Hull, A History of Ireland:The Statutes of Kilkenny, accessed 5 November 2009 Maud, who was a baby, and her mother fled to England. Sometime between 8 August 1347 and 25 April 1348, Maud's mother became a canoness at the Augustinian Priory of Campsey in Suffolk.  Marriage  Sometime before 10 June 1350, when she was still a child, she married Thomas de Vere, son and heir of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford and Maud de Badlesmere. He would succeed to the title of 8th Earl in 1360; henceforth, Maud was styled as the Countess of Oxford. The marriage produced one son: * Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, Marquess of Dublin, Duke of Ireland (16 January 1362- 1392), married firstly, Philippa de Coucy, and secondly Agnes de Launcekrona. Maud's husband died in September 1371. Maud was provided-for in terms of dower and jointure; from 1371, she held nearly half the de Vere ancestral estates and she received an annual income of ¬£662.Clark, p.27 Her principal residence was Great Bentley in Essex. She was described as a profligate landowner,Clark, p.26 and later engaged in litigations with her brother-in-law, Aubrey de Vere, 10th Earl of Oxford over de Vere property. In 1387, when her son Robert repudiated his first wife, Philippa for Agnes de Launcekrona, a Czech lady-in-waiting of Queen consort Anne of Bohemia, Maud took Philippa's side against her son. She admitted to holding Philippa \\"more dear than as if she had been her own daughter\\",Clark, p.26 and did not hesitate to curse Robert for his actions. Philippa was afterwards taken into Maud's household. Despite her anger at her son's treatment of his wife, Maud nevertheless visited him in Brabant following his forced exile by the Lords Appellant and Parliament in 1388, where she brought him gifts. She received a pardon on 10 May 1391 for \\"having crossed the sea without licence to Brabant to confer with her son Robert de Vere, late earl of Oxford, and for relieving him with certain gifts\\".Clark, p.26 Maud remained in high favour with King Richard after her son's exile, having received on 16 November 1389 a grant of the farm of all the lands \\"lately her husband's\\" for twenty years.Clark, p.26 This was cancelled upon her son's death in 1392, when his uncle Aubrey succeeded as Earl of Oxford.  Conspiracy  In 1404, Maud involved herself in a conspiracy along with the abbots of Beeleigh, Colchester, and St. Osyth to depose King Henry IV by way of a French invasion, and replace him with King Richard who was allegedly still alive. It was also alleged that she had caused the white harts of Richard II's livery to be fashioned.Clark, p.32 She was arrested and sent to the Tower of London in May 1404; however, due to the intervention of Queen consort Joanna of Navarre, she was eventually pardoned by King Henry on 16 November 1404. Maud died on 25 January 1413 at her residence in Great Bentley, Essex and was buried at Bruisyard Abbey in Suffolk instead of the monastery of Earl's Colne of which she had been the patron, and where her husband and son were buried.

This genus is within the clade Cladobranchia (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005). Description Dendronotus has an elongated, broad body, with 4 to 8 pairs of branched cerata on the notum. Animals in this genus have an obvious oral veil with 2 to 5 extensions. These extensions may be branched. Smaller unbranched extensions are found around the mouth. The rhinophores are surrounded by a sheath and the sheath itself has branched extensions. A large extension is found on the side at the base of each rhinophore. The anal opening occurs between the first and second set of dorsal cerata on the right side of the body.Ekimova, I.; Korshunova, T.; Schepetov, D.; Neretina, T.; Sanamyan, N.; Martynov, A. (2015).

Lev was born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio. In his youth, he participated in the Golden Gloves competitions for amateur boxing. He graduated from Miami University in 1955 and received his doctorate from Cornell University, where he became a member of the Modern Indonesia Project. Lev first traveled to Indonesia in 1959 and stayed in the country for three years. Because of his experience in Indonesia, Lev became a proponent of law reform after observing the \\"systematic dismantling\\" of its legal system under Presidents Sukarno and Suharto. After returning to the United States, he became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Lev's opposition to the Vietnam War was not well received by the university and likely prevented him from receiving tenure. Soon after, he moved to Seattle to teach at the University of Washington before finally retiring in 1999. As a scholar of Indonesian law, Lev helped the country's lawyers and activists continue their education in the United States. His dissertation titled The Transition to Guided Democracy: Indonesian Politics 1957‚Äì1959 analyzed Sukarno's Guided Democracy principles and became a classic reading on the development of the country's political system. He was also a member of Human Rights Watch and served on the advisory committee of its Asia division. Lev was a heavy smoker and died from lung cancer on July 29, 2006. He had been writing a biography on Chinese Indonesian lawyer and human rights advocate Yap Thiam Hien at the time of his death.

Italy was a case brought before the European Court of Human Rights, which, on 18 March 2011, ruled that the requirement in Italian law that crucifixes be displayed in classrooms of schools does not violate the European Convention on Human Rights.Full text of the judgment of the European Court of Human RightsPress release of the European Court of Human RightsSummary of the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights The case The case stemmed from a request of Mrs Soile Lautsi, a Finnish-born Italian national, against the School Council of a school in Abano Terme (province of Padua). When the School Council decided not to comply, Lautsi applied to the Veneto Administrative Court. The administrative Court decided, on 17 March 2005, that the presence of crucifixes in State-school classrooms did not offend the principle of secularism. Lautsi appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Veneto Court's decision reasoning that in Italy the crucifix symbolized the religious origin of values (tolerance, mutual respect, valorization of the person, affirmation of one's rights, consideration for one's freedom, the autonomy of one's moral conscience vis-√†-vis authority, human solidarity and the refusal of any form of discrimination) which characterized Italian civilization and that keeping the Crucifix did not have any religious connotations.Case of Lautsi and Others v. Italy, European Court of Human Rights (Application No. 30814/06) www.echr.coe.int/echr/resources/hudoc/lautsi_and_others_v__italy.pdf European Court of Human Rights Lautsi then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on 27 July 2006. On 3 November 2009, a Chamber of the Second Section of the Court declared that there had been a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. This decision caused uproar in Italy.Rulings in Europe and South America Affirm Display of Christian Symbols Lautsi declared that she had received threats and had been a victim of vandalism, and complained about statements by politicians.Open letter by M. Albertin and S. Lautsi The Chamber that considered the case decided that Italy was in violation of Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Article 2 of the first Protocol to the Convention, reasoning that among the plurality of meanings the crucifix might have, the religious meaning was predominant. The Chamber argued that 'the \\"negative\\" freedom of religion was not limited to the absence of religious services or religious education: it extended to practices and symbols expressing, in particular or in general, a belief, a religion or atheism. It added that this \\"negative right\\" deserved special protection if it was the State, through public schools, which expressed a belief, thus placing dissenters in a situation from which they could not extract themselves except by making disproportionate efforts and sacrifices. Conversely, the Court disputed the claim by the Italian state that the display in state schools of symbols associated with Catholicism served the value of pluralism. Italian Government reaction On 28 January 2010, the Italian government lodged an appeal to the Grand Chamber of the Court. Its position was supported by the governments of Lithuania, Slovakia and Poland: \\"Lithuania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds that the use of crucifixes in public in Catholic countries reflects the European Christian tradition and should not be regarded as a restriction on the freedom of religion\\", stated its spokespersonWhen a cross is not a cross, BalticReports, 13 January 2010 By July 2010, twenty countries had officially expressed their support for Italy's appeal against the ruling. The decision of the Chamber of the Court was also deplored by the Orthodox Church of Greece.Greek Orthodox Church opposes EU crucifix ban European Parliament In the European Parliament, two motions for resolutions were proposed: one by S&D; group, calling for \\"recognition of [...] the freedom of Member States to exhibit any religious symbol in public\\", another by GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA groups, stating belief that \\"only states based on the principle of the separation of church and state ‚Äì as opposed to theocratic states ‚Äì can find the proper solutions to safeguard everybody's right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to education and the prohibition of discrimination\\" and \\"it should not be compulsory to display religious symbols in premises used by public authorities\\" ECHR 2010 ruling In March 2010, the case was referred to Court's Grand Chamber.Press release, 02.03.2010.

The museum was constructed with a budget from the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) under the supervision of the Department of Mineral Resources and comprises an area of . It has been open to the public since 2009.  Background  Distal part of a left femur of a sauropod dinosaur regarded as the first dinosaur discovery of Thailand Dinosaur fossils were first discovered in Thailand during mineral exploration in the Phu Wiang area of Khon Kaen province. In 1976 Sudham Yaemniyom, a geologist, discovered a piece of bone on a streambed, Huai Pratu Tima, which was later identified as a distal part of the left femur of a sauropod dinosaur,Ingavat, R., Janvier, R., and Taquet, P. (1978) Decouverte en Thailande d'une portion de femur de dinosaure sauropode (Saurischia, Reptilia). C.R. Soc.Geol.France 3: 140-141 regarded as the first dinosaur discovery of Thailand. Since 1976, the Department of Mineral Resources, together with the Thai-French Paleontological Project, investigated the dinosaurs in the Phu Wiang mountains. The project found many vertebrae, teeth, and dinosaur footprints mainly from sandstone of the Early Cretaceous Sao Khua Formation (about 130 million years old), including sauropod and theropod, with a wide range of sizes, from a hen up to a large dinosaur with about 15 meters long. These finds led Thai people to visit the dinosaur sites, and Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn visited Site 2 on 3 November 1989. She also revisited the site, viewing Site 3 and the Phu Wiang Dinosaur Museum, with the committees of the Prince Mahidol International Award, of the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation, on 25 October 2008.  Site development  After Phu Wiang National Park was established in 1991, the Khon Kaen province and Phu Wiang district administrations, TAT, the Department of Mineral Resources, and other government agencies recognized the importance of the dinosaur sites in the national park. Consequently,TAT was allocated a budget to develop four dinosaur sites, namely Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, and Site 9, by constructing small buildings covering the sites to protect the dinosaur bones from disturbances, together with walking trails connecting the sites.  Museum origin  Discovery of the dinosaurs on the Phu Wiang mountains, especially the sauropod dinosaur Phuwiangosaurus sirindhornae, named after Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, was regarded as important and raised awareness of the Phu Wiang mountains. Some government agencies agreed that it was appropriate to build the Phu Wiang Dinosaur Museum and chose the Khok Sanambin public area with an area of as the place of construction with a budget from TAT, to the size of 5,500 square meters. The Department of Mineral Resources was delegated to look after and administer the site by establishing a permanent exhibition and opening it to the public in 2001.  Museum composition  The Phu Wiang Dinosaur Museum houses activities including a research and investigation section, fossil replication and conservation, a fossil collection house, library, permanent exhibition, administration office, and service space such as a canteen, souvenir shop, snack and drinks shop, car parking space, and a 140-person capacity auditorium.

As one of the earliest ethnographic films, it documents the life of the Svan people in the isolated mountain village of Ushguli in Svanetia, in the northwestern part of the Georgian Soviet Republic. Containing some propaganda, the climax of the film shows how a Soviet built road connects the previously isolated mountain village to Soviet civilisation. Many of the scenes of the film were staged, and the authenticity of some scenes has been disputed by the Svan people. Synopsis The mountain village of Ushguli during the opening of the film. Most of Salt for Svanetia describes and explores the daily life of the Svan people, who are living isolated from civilisation in a harsh natural environment in the mountainous region of Svanetia. The film starts with the Lenin quotation \\"Even now there are far reaches of the Soviet Union where the patriarchal way of life persists along with remnants of the clan system.\\" Svanetia and the mountain village of Ushguli are then located on two slowly dissolving maps of the region and are described as \\"cut off from civilization by mountains and glaciers\\". The location of the village is further introduced by several expository shots showing the Svanetian landscape. These shots give some emphasis to tall towers (still visible in the 2006 photograph below). It explains that these have been constructed by villagers to serve as a defense against feudal overseers, and it shows how villagers have used them to fend off tax collectors by heaving rocks from the tower tops. This introductory focus on class conflict fades as the film moves to concentrate on the daily routine of the villagers. One sequence shows how sheep are raised, another how wool and yarn are produced, and another on how barley is threshed. These sequences powerfully convey the technological underdevelopment of the area. Wool spinning technique antedates the spinning wheel; barley is threshed by cattle dragging a stone studded platform, weighed down by a mother tending to her child, over the barley. Another scene shows a suspension bridge and a man trying to cross over rushing water as his pack animals resist. A desperate harvest during an early July snowstorm is shown. Other scenes show how the Svan people tailor their clothes, make hats, cut their hair and bury their dead. The film then concentrates on the lack of salt supplies. Cut off from the outside world for most of the year, the village suffers from a shortage of salt. It is shown how this forces the animals to lick human sweat and urine. A party of workers, returning from migratory labor farther down the valley, are shown bringing salt back to the village. Most of them die when they are crushed by an avalanche. The solution to the salt shortage is presented in the climax of the film where the young Soviet power builds a road that connects the isolated region to the outside world. The film shows how teams of construction workers with their steamrollers arrive, cutting down a forest that is the last obstacle for the road that will connect the Svan people with Soviet civilisation. Production The mountain village of Ushguli in 2006. Svanetia was an underdeveloped region, and thus Soviet planners tried to make it a showcase of Soviet modernization during the first five-year plan between 1928 and 1932. During this time roads were built, an air service was established and industries such as mining and lumbering were developed. At the same time Soviet authorities tried to change and sovietize the traditional life of the Svan people. It was against this background of Svanetia as a showcase of Soviet modernization that Salt for Svanetia was produced. Inspired by a tour of the Caucasus, the writer and journalist Sergei Tretyakov wrote a newspaper article that gave Kalatozov the idea for the film. Tretyakov then wrote a script for Kalatozov, and shooting began in the mountain village Ushguli in Upper Svanetia. Originally the film was planned to be a fictional feature film, but ultimately Viktor Shklovsky edited the footage Kalatozov had shot in Svanetia into a documentary film. Most, but not all, parts of the documentary were staged, similar to other Soviet documentaries of the early 1930s. The authenticity of some scenes has been disputed by the Svan people who deny that some of the customs shown have ever existed. The cinematography of Mikhail Kalatozov and the cinematographer Shalva Gegelashvili has been described as expressionistic due to its use of dramatic shadows, silhouettes against a dramatic skyline and Dutch angles. Responses After the film was finished it was criticized by Stalinist authorities as being unbalanced and unfair towards Svanetia. It was claimed that the director was too fascinated by the backwardness and superstition of Svanetia, and only superficially interested in socialist modernization. Kalatozov fell out of favor, culminating in a ban of his next film Nail in the Boot and a denunciation of his script on Imam Shamil. Despite the negative immediate reaction, Salt for Svanetia has been praised by film historians and other film directors. The Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky called it an \\"amazing film\\".

It was the first major box office hit about events concerning the newly reunified Germany. Unlike other films in this period that focused on the problems following reunification, Go Trabi Go sees the main characters, former citizens of East Germany, explore places in Europe outside the Eastern Bloc that they were not allowed to visit during the Communist era. Synopsis The year is 1990 and Germany has been newly reunified. German teacher Udo Struutz decides that his family should go on their first vacation in the \\"west\\" to relive Goethe's Italian Journey in their family Trabant 601 (\\"Trabi\\"). Plot Udo Struutz (Wolfgang Stumph), teacher in the East German town of Bitterfeld, Saxony-Anhalt, is a great fan of Goethe and wants to visit all places described in Goethe's Italian Journey. Following the German reunification in 1990, he sees the possibility to do so since it is now possible for him and his wife Rita (Marie Gruber) and daughter Jacqueline (Claudia Schmutzler) to travel to Italy. Driving in their family Trabant (called \\"Schorsch\\"), they set out to go on their first vacation in the \\"west\\". Their first stop on their journey southwards is Regensburg where Struutz's brother-in-law (Ottfried Fischer) lives, who are portrayed as extreme opposites to the East German family. Following this short family reunion, the family with their Trabant is transported by a friendly truck driver to Italy where they continue on their own again. Arriving in Rome, the family's borrowed camera is stolen which prompts mother and daughter Struutz to chase after the thief, not only recovering their camera but also the money the thief stole. Not being able to talk to the police about it and not being able to find Udo again, they decide to check into a luxury hotel with the recovered money. Meanwhile, Udo sleeps in the car after driving through the city the whole day and is awakened by four young women who want to party with him, which leads to the Trabi driving down some stairs and casing being torn apart which they then replace with colorful spare parts. The family reunites at the Spanish Steps the next day and continues onto Naples where the Trabi loses its roof because the family forgot to secure it in place while trying to make a picture of themselves with Vesuvius in the background. Reception Go Trabi Go was a major box office hit, attracting 1.5 million viewers in both parts of Germany, making it one of only three unification films that enjoyed success at the box office. This success has been described as being partly due to the love/hate relationship many East Germans had with their \\"Trabi\\", which was the most well-known and ridiculed symbol of East Germany. Stephen Kinzer of The New York Times described the movie as a way for East Germans to laugh \\"not precisely at themselves, but at the absurdities of the system under which they lived until last year.\\" He likens the Trabi as a symbol for the people who built it, who \\"survive[d] through difficult times and ultimately triumph[ed]\\". The film was also praised for its rollicking portrayal of the car as a main character while still getting across the problems of the \\"East\\" in the newly reunified country by using the car as a metaphor ‚Äî slow, breaking down and ridiculed by the West. The film was criticised for relying almost solely on crude clich√©s and mostly ignoring politically sensitive issues. Another reason for criticism was that the film paints the main characters in a humble, fair and nice way while their West German counterparts are depicted as vulgar, mean and shallow. The film was followed by a sequel, Go Trabi Go 2: Das war der wilde Osten (1992), which did not match the success of the original.

Life and times Patricio Peralta Ramos was born in the San Nicol√°s, a Buenos Aires neighbourhood, in 1814. His father, Jos√© de Peralta, was a high-ranking official of the Patricios Regiment. In 1860, he married a distant relative, Cecilia Ramos, with whom he had twelve children. Peralta Ramos became a large clothing supplier to the Argentine Army during the 1829-52 regime of Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas, of whom Peralta Ramos became an official supporter in 1842. A wealthy man by the time of Rosas' overthrow at the 1852 Battle of Caseros, he traveled in 1860 to the Atlantic Ocean shore, where he purchased over 136,000 hectares (340,000 acres) from Portuguese Consul and entrepreneur Jos√© Coelho de Meyrelles, and a meat salting house. His beef jerky facility struggling, Peralta Ramos embarked on the initial real estate development of his vast, scenic land. His enterprise met with the resistance of the gentry of Balcarce (then the county seat), though in 1865, he obtained a favorable ruling for the shoreline development from the local Justice of Peace, Juan Pe√±a. Seizing on a discrepancy between Peralta Ramos' holdings and what appeared in the official appraisal, Balcarce founder and Mayor Jos√© Chaves nearly forced his adversary to relocate his planned development on marshland, but an 1867 letter in Peralta Ramos' support by neighboring Mar Chiquita Judge Jos√© Bernal to Buenos Aires Province official Nicol√°s Avellaneda settled the dispute in Peralta Ramos' favor. Mar del Plata's Bristol Beach, around 1910 Advertising the development as Puerto de la Laguna de los Padres, the sale of allotments was successful, and in 1873, Peralta Ramos petitioned the province for the seaside hamlet's incorporation, which was granted by Governor Mariano Acosta on February 10, 1874, as Puerto Balcarce. As this nomenclature was assigned over his objections, Peralta Ramos unofficially christened the community Mar del Plata (in the sense of \\"Sea of the River Plate region\\").Creemos, sin embargo, que por ser el primer contacto que los hombres del R√≠o de la Plata tomaron con el mar se llam√≥ a este punto precisamente mar \\"del Plata\\".

Constructed between 1939 and 1943, it is today operated by the Harzwasserwerke company. The dam's reservoir impounds the waters of the Ecker river and mainly serves for drinking water supply.  Operation  Ecker Reservoir The dam is used for the supply of drinking water, flood protection, and raising water levels during times of low rainfall. With an average discharge of 16 million m¬≥ per year, it provides drinking water to the cities of Brunswick, Wolfenb√ºttel, and Wolfsburg. A pipe system leads to a central water tower near Liebenburg, where the waters of the nearby Grane Dam are also collected. Electricity generation is also provided through a small hydropower plant, operated by two turbines with an installed capacity of 2 x 300 kW and an annual generation of 1,400,000 kWh.  Construction  The Ecker Dam was the third modern reservoir built in the Harz mountains, after the construction of the S√∂se Dam in 1928‚Äì1931 and the Oder Dam in 1930‚Äì1933. It was laid out in the Ecker catchment area at the foot of the Brocken massif, characterised by extended upland bogs and heavy precipitation of up to a year. The reservoir uses a section of the river valley which, below a prominent trough end, was dug out in the shape of a basin by an ice age glacier. Construction started in 1939, mainly to meet the increasing demand for drinking water in the Brunswick greater area and around the recently openend Wolfsburg Volkswagen Plant. For the first time in Germany, coarse-grained concrete (R√ºttelgrobbeton) with an aggregate of up to 300 mm grain size was used to build the gravity structure. Works continued throughout World War II, when the Nazi authorities also deployed foreign workers (Fremdarbeiter) and POWs to complete the facilities. Preserved East German border post on the dam crest After the war and the division into East and West Germany from 1949, the inner German Border ran straight through the site. The Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic had walls and barbed wire mounted on the dam crest and only about two-thirds of the facilities were accessible from the west. Access rights to operate the facilities were settled by bilateral agreements in the late 1970s.  Tourism  Though not accessible by car, the Ecker Dam and the circular trail around its reservoir are popular destinations for daytrippers. The dam wall is checkpoint no. 1 in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking trail network.

The volunteer regiment became notorious for its involvement in the 1819 Peterloo Massacre, in which as many as 15 people were killed and 400‚Äì700 were injured. Often referred to simply as the Manchester Yeomanry, the regiment was disbanded in 1824. Formation After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, many textile workers in the newly industrialised towns of northern England lost their jobs as a result of an economic slump connected to the reduced need for mat√©riel. Even for those still employed, rising food prices made life very difficult. At the same time, writers such as William Cobbett were denouncing the inequity of the electoral system, as evidenced by rotten boroughs. Poor mill workers were a naturally sympathetic audience for a succession of radical organisers and speakers who spoke of electoral reform and alleviating poverty. This radical movement deeply worried many supporters of the Tory party, particularly in northern England. The fear of popular revolt had begun with the American and French revolutions in the late 18th-century. Many Tory supporters, such as mill owners, landowners and tradesmen, saw the agitation for suffrage as little less than sedition. The Tory party strongly opposed the proposed reforms. On 10 March 1817, about 5,000 people met in St Peters Field in central Manchester, aiming to march to London to set their grievances before the Prince Regent. Each person carried a rug or blanket, leading them to be named Blanketeers. The march was quickly suppressed, but Manchester Tories worried that they lacked protection from the hostile masses. This fear spurred a petition with more than 100 signatures to \\"the Boroughreeves and Constables of Manchester and Salford\\" demanding a meeting to establish a yeomanry corps.Bruton, p. 86-87 The constables organized the meeting for 19 June 1817. Wheeler's Manchester Chronicle reported that those present resolved \\"that under the present circumstances it is expedient to form a body of Yeomanry Cavalry in the Towns and neighborhood of Manchester and Salford\\". The newspaper noted that government allowances were available for uniforms, and that if neighboring towns formed their own corps they might be later combined. Each man was to provide his own horse. Thomas Trafford, owner of substantial lands in Lancashire and Cheshire, was commissioned as the cavalry's first Major-Commandant on 23 August 1817.\\"Commissions in the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry\\" As with many yeomanry regiments of the time, it was a relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among shopkeepers and tradesmen. A notice in the London Gazette on 6 October 1818 listed the appointment of officers to the corps over the past year. Peterloo Massacre Caricature by George Cruikshank showing the yeomanry charging the rally in St Peter's Fields On 16 August 1819, Major Trafford and Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange, the overall military commander in Manchester, were sent notes by the chairman of the Lancashire and Cheshire Magistrates, local coalowner William Hulton, urging them to dispatch troops to a public meeting on voting reform being addressed by the orator Henry Hunt. The notes were handed to two horsemen standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. Trafford dispatched 116 officers and men of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry who immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her child when he was thrown from her arms;Frow (1984), p. 8. two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.Reid (1989), p. 168. Special constables were already present at the meeting, but no troops. Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley, a local factory owner, arrived at the house from where the magistrates were watching; some reports allege that they were drunk.Reid (1989), p. 156. Andrews, the Chief Constable, instructed Birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute. Birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed; it was by then about 1:40 pm. Major Trafford himself appears not to have been present for the disastrous attack on the assembled crowd that followed.Reid (1989), p. 170.A map of St Peter's Field and surrounding area on The route towards the hustings between the special constables was narrow, and as the inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared and plunged as people tried to get out of their way. The arrest warrant had been given to the Deputy Constable, Joseph Nadin, who followed behind the yeomanry. As the cavalry pushed towards the speakers' stand they became stuck in the crowd, and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres.Poole (2006), p. 262. On his arrival at the stand Nadin arrested Hunt, Johnson and a number of others including John Tyas, the reporter from The Times.Reid (1989), p. 185. According to Tyas the yeomanry's progress through the crowd had provoked a hail of bricks and stones, and caused them to lose \\"all command of temper\\".Reid (1989), p 180. Their mission to execute the arrest warrant having been achieved, they then set about destroying the banners and flags carried by the crowd. From his vantage point William Hulton perceived the unfolding events as an assault on the yeomanry, and on L'Estrange's arrival at 1:50 pm, at the head of his hussars, he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words: \\"Good God, Sir, don't you see they are attacking the Yeomanry; disperse the meeting!\\"Walmsley (1969), p. 214. The 15th Hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of St Peter's Field, and charged into the crowd. At about the same time the Cheshire Yeomanry charged from the southern edge of the field.Reid (1989), p. 175. At first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing, as the main exit route into Peter Street was blocked by the 88th Infantry Regiment, standing with bayonets fixed. One officer of the 15th Hussars was heard trying to restrain the by now out of control Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, who were \\"cutting at every one they could reach\\": \\"For shame! For shame! Gentlemen: forbear, forbear! The people cannot get away!\\"Reid (1989), p. 181. Within ten minutes the crowd was dispersed, at the cost of at least 11 dead and over 600 injured.McPhillips (1997), pp. 22‚Äì23. Aftermath and disbandment The government and landowners viewed the yeomanry's actions at Peterloo as a courageous defence against insurrection. Following the massacre, on 27 August 1819, Lord Sidmouth sent a message of thanks from the Prince Regent to Major Trafford, among others. However, public horror at the actions of the yeomanry grew after the massacre. Major Trafford resigned his commission in 1820, and the yeomanry corps was disbanded on 9 June 1824.

By regulating the transcription in DNA sequences, the stability of RNA, and the capability of messenger RNA to be translated, RNA processing events allow for a diverse array of proteins to be synthesized from a single gene. Since RNA processing is heritable, it is subject to natural selection suggested by Darwin and contributes to the evolution and diversity of most eukaryotic organisms. Role of RNA in conventional evolution In accordance with the central dogma of molecular biology, RNA passes information between the DNA of a genome and the proteins expressed within an organism. Therefore, from an evolutionary standpoint, a mutation within the DNA bases results in an alteration of the RNA transcripts, which in turn leads to a direct difference in phenotype. RNA is also believed to have been the genetic material of the first life on Earth. The role of RNA in the origin of life is best supported by the ease of forming RNA from basic chemical building blocks (such as amino acids, sugars, and hydroxyl acids) that were likely present 4 billion years ago. Molecules of RNA have also been shown to effectively self-replicate, catalyze basic reactions, and store heritable information. As life progressed and evolved over time only DNA, which is much more chemically stable than RNA, could support large genomes and eventually took over the role as the major carrier of genetic information. Variability of RNA processing Research within the past decade has shown that strands of RNA are not merely transcribed from regions of DNA and translated into proteins. Rather RNA has retained some of its former independence from DNA, and is subject to a network of processing events that alter the protein expression from that bounded by just the genomic DNA. Processing of RNA influences protein expression by managing the transcription of DNA sequences, the stability of RNA, and the translation of messenger RNA. Alternative splicing Splicing is the process by which non-coding regions of RNA are removed. The number and combination of splicing events varies greatly based on differences in transcript sequence and environmental factors. Variation in phenotype caused by alternative splicing is best seen in the sex determination of D. melanogaster. The Tra gene, determinant of sex, in male flies becomes truncated as splicing events fail to remove a stop codon that controls the length of the RNA molecule. In others the stop signal is retained within the final RNA molecule and a functional Tra protein is produced resulting in the female phenotype. Thus, alternative RNA splicing events allow differential phenotypes, regardless of the identity of the coding DNA sequence. RNA stability Phenotype may also be determined by the number of RNA molecules, as more RNA transcripts lead to a greater expression of protein. Short tails of repetitive nucleic acids are often added to the ends of RNA molecules in order to prevent degradation, effectively increasing the number of RNA strands able to be translated into protein. During mammalian liver regeneration RNA molecules of growth factors increase in number due to the addition of signaling tails. With more transcripts present the growth factors are produced at a higher rate, aiding the rebuilding process of the organ. RNA silencing Silencing of RNA occurs when double stranded RNA molecules are processed by a series of enzymatic reactions, resulting in RNA fragments that degrade complementary RNA sequences. By degrading transcripts, a lower amount of protein products are translated and the phenotype is altered by yet another RNA processing event. Evolutionary mechanism Most RNA processing events work in concert with one another and produce networks of regulating processes that allow a greater variety of proteins to be expressed than those strictly directed by the genome. These RNA processing events can also be passed on from generation to generation via reverse transcription into the genome. Over time, RNA networks that produce the fittest phenotypes will be more likely to be maintained in a population, contributing to evolution. Studies have shown that RNA processing events have especially been critical with the fast phenotypic evolution of vertebrates‚Äîlarge jumps in phenotype explained by changes in RNA processing events. Human genome searches have also revealed RNA processing events that have provided significant ‚Äúsequence space for more variability‚Äù. On the whole, RNA processing expands the possible phenotypes of a given genotype and contributes to the evolution and diversity of life.

Voice of the Work) was a daily newspaper published in Indonesia. Established in 1971 to assist Golkar in winning that year's legislative election, it became required reading for all civil servants and the voice of Golkar. After its circulation increased from 55,700 in 1971 to 300,000 in 1998, the fall of Suharto's dictatorship caused circulation to plummet to 3,000. , it is attempting rebranding to present cleaner, less biased news.  History   New Order (1971‚Äì1998)  The first issue of Suara Karya was published on 11 March 1971 by the Suara Karya Foundation under direction of Golkar (Functional Group), prior to the July legislative election to assist the group. It took three days of preparation and Rp 50 million (at the time US$130,000) in start-up costs for the newspaper to be established. Its chief executive was Sumiskun, and the head editor was Jamal Ali. Other members of the editorial staff included Syamsul Bisri, Rahman Tolleng, Sayuti Melik, David Natipulu, and Cosmas Batubara. For the first edition, 25,000 four-page copies were printed and sold at Rp. 10 each. A quarter of the front page was dedicated to a congratulatory note from President Suharto, while the main story was \\"Presiden Jawab Pertanyaan-pertanyaan Sekitar Supersemar\\" (\\"President Answers Questions regarding Supersemar\\"), which covered Suharto's explanation of Supersemar and offered support for it. It also provided the paper's mission statement, which has been described as being \\"explicit that Suara Karya wanted to be a partisan paper\\". Suara Karya influence resulted in Golkar winning their first election and securing their political power. The newspaper afterwards became required reading for all government employees. It soon came into direct competition with Kompas, which became its biggest competitor. From 1971 to 1988, total circulation (shown in blue) grew to 112,312 copies With the support of Golkar, circulation expanded rapidly. By 1972, Suara Karya was selling 57,400 copies a day, 90.6% to the general public. During the succeeding years circulation varied, sometimes rising, sometimes falling drastically. By 1987, circulation had reached 124,079. At that time, Suara Karya employed 81 reporters, giving a ratio of one reporter for every 1,500 copies sold. It reached a circulation of 300,000 by 1998 and was considered the voice of Golkar Most of the subscribers were civil servants, who were required to do so by Golkar. In 1983, together with Kompas, Suara Pembaruan, and Tempo, Suara Karya founded the Jakarta Post. In 1994, Suara Karya was estimated to own a 35% share of the company, making it the largest shareholder. In 1989, Suara Karya received light sanctions from the Ministry of Information after running an article on the Sultan of Brunei. The article was considered likely to cause the Sultan emotional distress.  Since 1998  When Suharto was forced to resign from office in 1998, Suara Karya circulation dropped sharply from 300,000 to 3,000. After Golkar received the largest number of votes in the 2004 legislative election, it attempted a revamp of the newspaper and vowed not to promote the party's political interests through the daily; Dirk Tomsa considers their efforts unsuccessful, as Suara Karya is still often used as a way for Golkar members to express their opinions. As of 2005, Golkar claims a circulation of 80,000.  Function  Rizal Mallarangeng notes that Suara Karya original function was to help establish strong public support for Golkar; the paper is described as being \\"the paper of Golkar and the New Order\\". Meanwhile, Syamsul Bisri considered Suara Karya a form of social control, dedicated towards \\"an idea ... the return to pure form of Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution\\".

Founded in 1928, the Harzwasserwerke were tasked with supplying drinking water, providing electrical power and flood protection. Over the course of the past 75 years, the Harzwasserwerke have expanded to be the biggest water supply company in Lower Saxony and is among the top ten water companies in Germany. The company utilizes the nearby Harz mountains, a well-known nature reserve and tourist destination in Germany, as a source of high-quality drinking water. Water is impounded in six reservoirs built between 1930 and 1969 in the Lower Saxon part of the Harz mountains; drinking water is prepared in three waterworks and distributed through pipes to large parts of Lower Saxony. The system is supplemented by four groundwater waterworks on the North German plain. Currently delivering over 94,4 million cubic meters of water per year,www.harzwasserwerke.de the Harzwasserwerke supply a number of municipal utilities as far away as Bremen, Brunswick, Wolfsburg and Hanover, among others. The elevation difference between the Harz mountains and the North German plain makes the terrain very suitable for the production of electrical energy by means of hydropower. Several dams are operated by the company and thus make it an important producer of renewable energy. Having been founded as a publicly owned enterprise, the company was privatized in 1996. It is still performing a number of public and communal services that go beyond the portfolio of other water suppliers. Beside the management and administration of flood protection installations, perhaps most intriguingly, the company is also responsible for the maintenance of the Upper Harz Water Regale, which has been designated by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2010. Harzwasserwerke GmbH is currently managed by Renke Droste and Guenter Wolters as CEOs. The annual turnover for 2010 surpassed 40 million EUR, while profits soared to 6.46 million EUR (up 36.5 percent from 2009).

In the island of Martinique it is best known as Rasta caterpillar (chenille rasta, in French) because of its colors which are reminiscent of the ones found in Rastafarian clothing and accessories. It is native to the tropical and subtropical Americas from the southern and southwestern United States to Brazil. The occasional individual has been recorded as far north as the northeastern United States. Description The adult moth is brown with gray and white markings, and the hindwing is a darker brown. The female may be lighter in tone. The body has gray, white, and black bands. The wingspan is 12.7 to 14 centimeters, and the female is generally slightly larger than the male.

It is black with aposematic yellow bands and a red- orange head. Toward the posterior end is an orange bump with a black horn roughly 2 centimeters long. The legs are orange with black spots. The pupa is about 7 centimeters long. It is yellow when new, turning brown and darkening to a reddish brown as it hardens. Biology The moth specializes on plants of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae. Host taxa include Plumeria species such as red frangipani (P. rubra) and white frangipani (P. alba), and golden trumpet (Allamanda cathartica). P. alba in particular is so often infested with this caterpillar that it has been nicknamed \\"the wormy tree\\". The female lays eggs in clusters of about 50 to 100. The caterpillars feed on the plant, detoxifying the poisonous latex present in most Apocynaceae. It pupates in the leaf litter or under the soil. The adult feeds on nectar. It has been recorded on Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense). It has been observed as a pollinator of the fringed star orchid (Coilostylis ciliaris) in Puerto Rico.Ackerman, J. D. and A. M. Montalvo. (1990). Short-and long-term limitations to fruit production in a tropical orchid. Ecology 71(1), 263-72. The caterpillar has several antipredator adaptations. Its consumption of toxic plants makes it distasteful to most predators. An exception is the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani), which tears the caterpillar apart to eat it, avoiding the gut containing the plant material. The caterpillar is also coated in barbed urticating hairs, which stick deeply in skin and cause irritation. If caught, the caterpillar bites.Mitton, J. Caterpillar or coral snake? Colorado Arts & Sciences Magazine. University of Colorado, Boulder. 14 May 2010. Impacts The species has been known to damage and defoliate Plumeria. Each caterpillar can consume three large leaves per day, and it will continue eating into the branches if it finishes the available foliage. Even in the case of defoliation, the species does not generally kill plants. The caterpillars are large and conspicuous and can be controlled by plucking them from the tree.

Due to the secrecy surrounding costs and profit margins in the film industry, figures of losses are usually rough estimates at best, and there are often conflicting estimates over how much a film has lost. To accommodate this uncertainty, the losses are presented as ranges where this is the case, and the list is ordered alphabetically in the absence of a definitive order. Because the films on the list have been released over a large span of time, currency inflation is also a factor that must be considered, so the losses are adjusted for inflation using the United States Consumer Price Index to enable an accurate comparison. Some films on this list grossed more than their production budgets yet are still regarded as flops. This can be due to Hollywood accounting practices that typically manipulate profits or keep costs secret to avoid profit-sharing agreements, but it is also possible for films to lose money legitimately even when the theatrical gross exceeds the budget. This is because a distributor does not collect the full gross, and the full cost of a film can substantially exceed its production budget once distribution and marketing is taken into account. For example, tax filings in 2010 for Cinemark Theatres show that only 54.5 percent of ticket revenues went to the distributor, with the exhibitor retaining the rest. While the distributor's cut will vary from film to film, a Hollywood studio will typically collect half the gross in the United States and less in other parts of the world. Marketing often represents a substantial share of the overall cost of the picture too: for a film with an average sized budget the promotion and advertising costs are typically half that of the production budget, and in the case of smaller films it is not unusual for the cost of the marketing to be higher than the production budget. In some cases, a company can make profits from a box office bomb when ancillary revenues are taken into account, such as home media sales and rentals, television broadcast rights, and licensing fees, so a film that loses money at the box office can still eventually break even. There are some films notorious for large production budgets that are commonly thought to be box-office bombs, but have either broken even or turned a profit. Cleopatra nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox with production and marketing costs of and numerous delays. Despite becoming the highest-grossing film of 1963 it failed to recoup its investment during its theatrical release, and eventually broke even in 1966 when Fox sold the television broadcast rights to ABC for $5 million. The total costs for Waterworld (1995) exceeded $300 million and it was perceived as a disaster at the time, despite grossing $264 million worldwide. It also eventually broke even through other revenue streams. Such films are still cited as high-risk examples in evaluating the prospects of future film productions. For example, Cleopatra was considered the film that killed big-budget epic films in the 1960s.

The album was recorded in 1970 at the Isle of Wight.http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/livewight.html Background Cohen reluctantly agreed to tour Europe after his second album, Songs from a Room, became a hit in England, reaching #2 on the charts. He was backed by a small country-influenced band called The Army that included guitarist Ron Cornelius and fiddle player Charlie Daniels. The group had been assembled by Cohen's new producer Bob Johnston, who also assumed keyboard duties. Cohen was scheduled to perform on the last day of the festival and had the unenviable task of following Jimi Hendrix. As can be seen in the footage shot by award-winning director Murray Lerner, the vibes at the festival were not good, with many fans upset that a wall had been erected to keep non-paying fans outside the concert grounds. A shaggy-haired Cohen appeared in the early morning of August 31, 1970 in front of an estimated crowd of at least 600,000. As Kris Kristofferson, who had played his own troubled set earlier, recalls on the Leonard Cohen Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 DVD: :I think it was about four o'clock in the morning they went in and woke him up in his trailer and he took a long time to get out to the stage. Everybody had been sittin' there in the filth, in their own squalor - half a million people there - for five days. And Leonard finally came out of his trailer and he was wearing his pyjamas...I never have known why they didn't just hoot him off the stage like they did with a lot of people, especially me! I can only think that he was such an honest performer and didn't scramble after anybody's attention. He took his time gettin' out there, he took his time tunin' up and he wasn't intimidated by a half million people who'd been very ugly. It was very late when Cohen, chin stubbled and now wearing a khaki safari jacket and jeans, finally took the stage. In the liner notes to album, film director Murray Lerner confesses to Sylvie Simmons: \\"As I watched him walk out there I thought this is going to be a disaster. Because the mood was still very mixed. There was definitely a sense of bad feeling, though there was also a sense of people being tired and not so aggressive as earlier. But Cohen was essentially acoustic, just as Kristofferson was, and I thought the crowd would be expecting a bigger high in terms of the sound of the music. I worried that what happened to Kristofferson would happen to him.\\" After glaring out at the darkness and strapping on his guitar, Cohen began by telling a story about his father taking him to the circus when he was a boy. Leonard didn't much like the circus, he told them sedately, but he had enjoyed the part when a man would ask everyone in the audience to light a match. He then asked the audience to do the same so he could see where they were. Almost from the moment he began speaking, the mood of the crowd changed, and when he began singing - starting with \\"Bird on the Wire\\" - many of them became transfixed. Kristofferson later commented to Cohen biographer Ira Nadel in the 1996 book Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen that the Canadian singer \\"did the damndest thing you ever saw: he Charmed the Beast. A lone sorrowful voice did what some of the best rockers in the world had tried for three days and failed.\\" Most of the songs that Cohen performs are from his first two albums, Songs of Leonard Cohen and Songs From a Room, although three songs - \\"Diamonds in the Mine,\\" \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" and \\"Sing Another Song, Boys\\" would appear on his next studio album Songs of Love and Hate in 1971, with the latter being culled directly from the Isle of Wight appearance. Cohen also speaks about the origins of some of the songs, revealing to the crowd that he'd written \\"One of Us Cannot Be Wrong\\" in a peeling room in the Chelsea Hotel when he was \\"coming off amphetamine and pursuing a blond lady that I met in a Nazi poster.\\" He also dedicated \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\" to the woman he knew who in 1961, \\"went into the bathroom and blew her head off with her brother's shotgun. She was right where you are now.\\" Lerner, whose footage of the 1970 festival did not begin to see release until 1995, was able to capture Cohen's performance and the serene, somewhat mesmerized demeanor of the spectators. Kristofferson, Joan Baez and Judy Collins watched Cohen's set from the side of the stage and can be seen clapping and singing along to the song \\"Tonight WIll Be Fine.\\" The performance of \\"Suzanne\\" was also used in the documentary film Message to Love by the same director. Reception Thom Jurek of AllMusic states, \\"Whether it's 'So Long, Marianne,' the poem 'They Locked Up a Man,' the stellar reading of 'The Partisan,' or the chilling version of 'Famous Blue Raincoat,' this is top- notch Cohen.\\" Track listing The Songs (audio CD and 2LP) # Introduction # \\"Bird on the Wire\\" # Intro to So Long, Marianne # \\"So Long, Marianne\\" # Intro: \\"Let‚Äôs renew ourselves now...\\" # \\"You Know Who I Am\\" # Intro to Poems # \\"Lady Midnight\\" # \\"They Locked Up a Man (poem) / A Person Who Eats Meat / Intro\\" # \\"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong\\" # \\"The Stranger Song\\" # \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" # \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\\" # \\"Diamonds In The Mine\\" # \\"Suzanne\\" # \\"Sing Another Song, Boys\\" # \\"The Partisan\\" # \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" # \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\" The Songs (DVD and Blu-ray) # \\"Intro: Diamonds In The Mine\\" # \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" # \\"It‚Äôs A Large Nation\\" # \\"Bird On The Wire\\" # \\"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong\\" # \\"The Stranger Song\\" # \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" # \\"They‚Äôve Surrounded The Island\\" # \\"Hey, That‚Äôs No Way To Say Goodbye\\" # \\"Sing Another Song Boys\\" # \\"Judy Collins Introduces Suzanne\\" # \\"Suzanne\\" # \\"Joan Baez On The Isle Of Wight\\" # \\"The Partisan\\" # \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\" # Credits: So Long, Marianne # Bonus Interviews: Bob Johnston, Judy Collins, Joan Baez, Kris Kristofferson.

History  Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti The hotel is at the exact location of the Cluny College (established in 1261 by the Order of Cluny), closed during the French Revolution and used as a studio by Jacques-Louis David where he painted The Coronation of Napoleon (1805‚Äì07). The Cluny College‚Äôs well is still visible inside the hotel. Arthur Rimbaud describes the hotel‚Äôs courtyard in a letter to Ernest Delahaye (June 1872): \\"I have a pretty room, overlooking a bottomless courtyard, but three square meters wide. Rue Victor-Cousin is on the corner of the Sorbonne's square near the caf√© du Bas-Rhin and leads to Rue Soufflot on the other end\\".

The Hungarian poet recalls this period in his poem \\"Paris\\" (1943): \\"Where the Boul‚Äô Mich‚Äô meets the Rue / Cujas the corner slopes perceptibly\\". A commemorative plaque by the hotel entrance celebrates the memory of Radn√≥ti with a quotation from \\"Hispania, Hispania\\": \\"The Nations sing your destiny, O Freedom / This afternoon that great song flew for sure\\".

As Sasan's wife family The lord Sasan who is named as the eponymous ancestor of the Sasanians took, according to Tabari, a wife from a family called \\"Bazrangi\\". The woman was called RƒÅmbehe≈°t and according to Tabari \\"possessed beauty and perfection\\". She bore Sasan a son called Papak. page 4. In the account of Tabari, Ardashir, the founder of Sassanid dynasty was sent for educational reasons, at the request of his father Papak, to Tƒ´rƒ´ who was the eunuch of G≈çƒçehr the king of E·π£·π≠a·∏µr. Later Ardashir succeeded Tƒ´rƒ´ who was the chief officer (i.e. argbed) of DƒÅrƒÅbgerd. Ardashir managed to make a number of local conquests and then wrote to his father to revolt against G≈çƒçehr. Papak did so and killed G≈çƒçehr and took his throne. This is the last time Tabari mentions about G≈çƒçehr or the BƒÅzrangƒ´ family and other notices of BƒÅzrangƒ´ in later sources are all taken from ·π¨abarƒ´. There has not been found any coins naming G≈çƒçehr or BƒÅzrangƒ´. There is a suggestion by S. Wikander that BƒÅzrang is not a name but rather a title with the etymology of \\"holding a mace\\", or \\"possessing miraculous power\\". This suggestion is unproven for R. N. Frye. As geographical district The word BƒÅzrang has been used in other historical sources, such as E·π£·π≠a·∏µrƒ´, to refer to a geographical district in the mountainous Boir A·∏•madƒ´ area where the ≈†ƒ´rƒ´n and ≈†ƒÅ·∏èkƒÅn rivers have their origin. R. Frye indicates that this district could be the one in the Pahlavi text Xusraw ud rƒìdag where excellent wine or must came from. Today however there are the villages upper BƒÅzrang and lower BƒÅzrang in the BehbahƒÅn district of the province of ·∏¥≈´zestƒÅn. There is also a mention in popular folktales of Iran that the word bƒÅzrangƒ´ means wild person. The connection of the geographical name and other occurrences of the word is uncertain. The word 'Bajrang' (or 'Bazrang' with a little syllable twisting) is associated with the Hindu deity Hanuman (otherwise called as 'Bajrang Bali' which means Bajrang the Strong) and due to Him being what He was like, even a few species of monkeys are referred to be as Bajrang in Hindi and other Indian languages.

Occasional strays can be found up to southern Texas and south-eastern Wyoming.  Description  The wingspan is 63‚Äì102 mm. The forewing tip is hooked and the upperside of the forewing is gray brown with dark-brown incomplete wavy lines and dark-brown and orange shading. The upperside of the hindwing has orange shading and dark-brown patches at the tip and in the center.  Biology  Adults are on wing in several generations in the tropics. The larvae feed on Echites umbellata, Ficus carica and other Ficus species. Pupation takes place in cocoons spun among leaf litter.

Video signal  Video signal (VF) or more formally composite video signal (CVS) is the signal which carries the video information as well as some auxiliary signals for synchronizing. In all systems 0-300 mV level is reserved for auxiliary signals and 300-1000 mV is reserved for video information. In monochrome TV, 300 mV (or sometimes 350 mV) corresponds to black and 1000 mV corresponds to white.( In color TV depending on the system used, superimposed color subcarrier may have slightly higher values. )  Modulation  The signal modulates a carrier by vestigal sideband modulation (a version of amplitude modulation) , where an increase in the video modulating signal produces a decrease in the carrier amplitude, called \\"negative modulation\\". When there is no modulating signal, the carrier has the full level and when there is a modulating video frequency (VF) signal the level of IF is lower. Since the level when transmitting a black scene is lower than the white level, the level of carrier when transmitting black is higher than the level of carrier when transmitting white. Carrier modulated by 1 Volt VF. (1 volt corresponds to white.) In this illustration, the carrier frequency is much lower than would practically be used, relative to the video signal frequency. The modulators are setBroadcast Engineers'Handbook to yield 10% or 12.5% of carrier level when modulated by 1 V signal (which corresponds to white scene) This percentage is known as residual carrier. An example of the modulated carrier is shown in the accompanying figure. In this figure, the level of the modulating VF signal is 1 volt (white level). 1 V. yields residual carrier (10%) .

Background  After the coup of 1980, all political parties were dissolved by the military government (ruling through the National Security Council or ) regardless of their political views, on 16 October 1981. In 1983, the MGK decided to allow the formation of new parties with severe restrictions. The new parties were not allowed to use the names of former parties and former politicians were not allowed to be charter member of the new parties.  Formation  One of the parties banned by MGK was the Republican People's Party (), the oldest party in Turkey. Supporters of the CHP including Avni G√ºler, Engin Aydƒ±n and Turhan Timu√ßin founded the People's Party as an intended successor to the CHP on 21 May 1983. The chairman of the party was Necdet Calp,Turkish parliament page who had once been an executive assistant of late ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, the second president of Turkey. Although he was not a widely known name, he caused nationwide excitement in a panel discussion on TV due to his reaction to the proposal of privatization of the ƒ∞stanbul Bosphorus Bridge.  Elections  The MGK banned SODEP, the main rival of the HP for the mantle of the CHP: as the sole heir of the CHP, the HP received 30.5 percent of the vote in the general election of 6 November 1983. The HP became the main opposition party. However this support could not be maintained in the local elections on 21 March 1984 as SODEP was now permitted to stand and the majority of the former CHP votes were redirected to SODEP. The HP had to be content with a 8.8 percent, which meant a loss of nearly 75 percent of its vote in less than give months.  Merging with SODEP  At the party's congress on 27 June 1985, Necdet Calp lost his position as chair to Aydƒ±n G√ºven G√ºrkan.T√ºrkiye'nin 74 yƒ±lƒ±, Tempo Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, H√ºrg√º√ß Gazetecilik, ƒ∞stanbul, 1998 G√ºrkan met with Rah≈üan Ecevit, who was planning to found the DSP party, and Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º, the chairman of SODEP, for a possible merger. Although Ecevit was reluctant, ƒ∞n√∂n√º, who had already proposed a merger of all CHP supporters, was an enthusiastic supporter of merging the two parties. On 3 November 1985, SODEP merged with the HP. ƒ∞n√∂n√º agreed to give up his seat during the merger period. The new party formed by this fusion was named the Social Democrat Populist Party () with the abbreviation SHP, which resembled that of CHP and a party flag with 6 arrows which resembled that of the CHP. The abbreviation SHP should not be confused with the same abbreviation used by the similarly-named but distinct Social Democratic People's Party after 2002.

The house is constructed in the locally available gritstone which has been dressed into coarse, squared blocks while the roof is of stone slates. The farmhouse consists of three storeys with most of the windows being at the front of the house which unusually faces away from the road (Annet Lane) and looks out over the valley of the Dale Dike. The ground floor of the front of the house consists of two large four light windows with the entrance door at the west end. The first floor also has two windows of similar size and design to the ground floor while the second storey has four smaller windows. The sides and rear of the house have only occasional small windows. The interior has much of the original panelling to the walls and doors intact, the ground floor has a bressummer beam. There is a stone staircase to the first floor and an oak staircase with a blustered rail to the second. Gives details of farmhouse. The outbuildings are detached from the main house and run at right angles to it on its western side. They are approximately 12 metres in length and slope down to the valley of the Dale Dike, so much so that the downhill end of the building has two storeys while the uphill end has only one. The building materials are the same as the main house, being gritstone blocks and stone slate and the mainstay of the building is believed to be 17th century. However, there have been some changes to the original design with a large boarded double door being added and resulting changes to the stonework to make a garage. There have also been some modifications to some of the other openings. Gives details of outbuildings. Great Sheffield flood Fair House Farmhouse managed to survive the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 when the dam wall of the Dale Dyke Dam fractured sending millions of gallons of water down the valley. The original dam wall stood just over a kilometre to the west of the house, there was great devastation in Low Bradfield but Fair House survived because it is in a slightly elevated position approximately 20 metres higher than the Dale Dike. Nearby stone built structures such as Annet House and Annet Bridge which stood by the Dike were completely swept away. Mick Armitage‚Äòs Sheffield Flood website. Gives details of Sheffield Flood.

Istituto di Genetica Vegetale (IGV) is a research network om Plant Genetics and Breeding within the Italian Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (National Research Council). IGV is headquartered in Bari and has four different Divisions in Portici, Palermo, Florence and Perugia. IGV started its activities on November 2002. IGV represents the merger of five former Institutes: *Germplasm Institute ‚Äì Bari *Institute of Forest Tree Breeding - Florence *Research Institute of Ornamental and Vegetable Plant Breeding -Portici *Research Institute for Citrus Genetics, Palermo *Research Institute for Grass and Fodder Crop Breeding - Perugia Research Lines IVG pays particular attention to specific sectors of the plant genetic resources such as local agro-ecotypes, ecotypes threatened of extinction, wild relatives of the cultivated plants, wild species used by man for several purposes, species that can be potentially exploited for the extraction of bio-active or technological products, and finally the model species. Currently the Bari Section preserves around 80.000 samples belonging to more than 40 genera and about 600 species. Numerous accessions have been acquired through the exchange with other Institutions. Altogether from 1972 over 80.000 samples have been distributed all over the world. Small data banks also exist on specific aspects, such as the protein quality and antinutritional factors (in wheat, beans, faba bean, lentil, cowpea, resistance to biotic stress (in wheat and faba bean), plant characters (in wheat and chickpea), rare, very rare and endemic angiosperm Italian species. From a general point of view the results and acquired experience have allowed the Section in Bari to become a reference of excellence in the national and international scientific community in the field of the safeguard of plant biodiversity. This has favoured the start of operational contacts with several public and private subjects interested in the exploitation of plant genetic resources. Wheat lines have been detected which contain a high level of proteins and lines characterized by protein components associated to pasta-making quality. Seed Bank The Bari Section has possesses cold rooms for the maintenance of seeds: for long storage seeds are kept at -20 ¬∞C; for short-medium term conservation, 0 ¬∞C and 30% of relative humidity are used. Bari has developed collaborations with analogous national (Faculty of Agriculture, Institutes of the CNR, MiPAF, ENEA, etc.) and international (FAO, IPGRI, IITA, ICARDA, IPK, etc.) Institutions. Bioinformatics In the last years, IGV has begun the development of a bioinformatics activity which has seen the creation of the web Data base of the accessions from the seed bank and of some of the results of the research activity. Those data bases are accessible on line in the official website.* Official website Divisions Florence Istituto di Genetica Vegetale, Firenze, Italy. The main research activities at the Florence division are the analysis of the genetic structure and the variability within and between populations of forest tree species. Florence can be now considered one of the leader at National and International level as it has been one of the first to set up and use the new biotechnologies to develop a lot of different biochemical and DNAmarkers. Florence has given a fundamental and sometimes original contribution to the increase of the knowledge in forest topics: * defining the level and the distribution of the genetic resources; * exploring the phylogenetic relationships between different species; * studying mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the genetic variability and potential adaptability. Palermo The research activities at the Palermo division range over all the fields of Citrus genetics. Main topics are: * Scion and rootstock improvement by conventional (hybridation and clonal selection) and biotechnological (protoplast culture, tissue culture, somatic embryogenesis) methods * Selection of useful genotypes * Molecular analysis and characterization of regenerated plants * Tissue culture for sanitation * Gene identification and isolation * Genetic transformation * Studies on the pharmacological and alimentary properties * Preservation and enhancement of local germplasm * Evaluation of plants suitable for ornamental use The main goal of the Palermo division is to obtain and select superior scion varieties, as compared to the ones currently used and improved rootstocks that will provide growers with alternative choices for any location. The strategy is to enhance the genetic variability in order to select new individuals. Perugia In the last five to eight years, the Perugia division gained new researchers, with new investigated species typical of the Umbria region where the division is operating and with new and more current research lines. The research on tree species such as Olive (Olea europaea) and Cherry (Prunus avium) was started in close collaboration with the regional public institutions focusing on two main objectives: * production of fingerprints of Italian varieties and * development of a database of molecular markers used in the perspective to study the association between candidate genes and/or anonymous molecular markers and traits of agronomic interest. In the last years a research line on truffle received a strong development, considering that Umbria is one of the very few regions that can boast appreciable productions of all the most important and prestigious species. Portici Istituto di Genetica Vegetale, Portici, Italy. Since the beginning, the Portici division has been researching the genetic improvement of several vegetable crops by conventional and biotechnological approaches. Most of the research projects are focused on ornamental and vegetable crops of economic interest for Southern Italian agricultural areas, such as tomato, potato, artichoke, tobacco. The main research objectives are designed at the developing and maintaining the genetic variability, speeding up the selection of superior genotypes, understanding the genetic control of reproduction and its association with yield improvement, increasing quality and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, through bio-molecular techniques, chromosomal manipulation and cell and tissue culture. The current research activities at Portici are focused on: * Identification, characterization and genetic transfer of genes involved in the adaptation and tolerance to environmental stress conditions (heat, cold, drought and salt) in potato and tomato and the model species Arabidopsis; * Development and use of molecular markers for varietal identification and assisted selection; * Genetic control and manipulation of sexual reproduction, by studying mutants and identifying key genes; * Innovative genetic-molecular approaches to improve and exploit local tomato varieties; * Introgression of useful genes (genes for biotic and abiotic constraints, genes for quality) from wild potato species into potato, rose, tomato, by somatic hybridization and interspecific crossing schemes; * Valorization of genetic resources of vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plants, typical of Southern Italy and Meditterrean areas; * Development of an efficient technology of plastid transformation and expression of useful genes for products destined for agro- and pharmaceutical industries.

The programme was written, produced, and directed by Rob Coldstream, and was broadcast on 9 November 2009. Though intended to open debate on hanging and capital punishment in the UK, the programme was poorly received and the choice of celebrity accused led to a complaint being registered with Ofcom by Glitter (which was later dismissed.) Plot Set in an imaginary Britain in which the death sentence has been reintroduced, the drama examines the possible outcomes of Glitter being the first to be put on trial under the imagined \\"Capital Crimes Act\\", shortly after its inception and his simultaneous extradition to the UK from Vietnam after serving three years there for sex offences. Glitter applies for entry to Hong Kong and Thailand, but is forced to return to the UK, where he is to be charged with rape and to stand trial as a paedophile for \\"category one sex offences\\" committed whilst abroad. Glitter meets his lawyer after returning and being arrested. He is informed of the possibility of either the case being dismissed or won due to the newness of the laws, and because they were committed abroad. He is suddenly shocked into reality when he is informed of the change in UK laws, and that the ultimate sentence he may face is death. A history of the campaign to bring back capital punishment is shown from its inception in 2004, as well as interviews with the public and people in positions of responsibility and their attitudes towards capital punishment. Glitter continuously proclaims his innocence, the public cry for justice and his death, while the media rake through his previous charges and history of offences. His trial goes ahead after an appeal for dismissal is denied. The evidence of the alleged offences is shown, as well as Glitter's statements to the police, and witnesses give their evidence, including Glitter himself. Glitter is found guilty, and the debate over sentencing begins. Glitter is told there are no mitigating circumstances shown, and he is sentenced to death within 30 days. Glitter maintains his innocence, and finds himself back in the charts just before he is executed, though the song turns out to be a mocking remix of one of his hit songs combined with a leaked recording of his own words from his trial speech. The film ends shortly after Glitter is hanged. Cast All cast are shown in the order they appear in the credits: *Hilton McRae as Gary Glitter *Adam James as John Carter QC *Clive Flint as DCI Crane *Louisa Rix as Valerie Clark: Home secretary *Caroline O'Neill as Kelly Andrews *Anna Nguyen as Girl A *Terence Harvey as Prosecution Counsel *Lai Thi Nhuyen as Mrs Tran *David Caldwell-Evans as Dr Jones *Malcolm Rennie as the Judge *Ann Widdecombe: as herself, a politician *Miranda Sawyer: as herself, a journalist *Garry Bushell: as himself, a journalist Production Rob Coldstream, the creator of the programme, wrote an account of the premise and production behind the drama which was published in The Independent in November 2009. He said that he had the idea for the programme after reading a report in a national newspaper that had said that \\"If Gary Glitter was to be strung up in Trafalgar Square tomorrow, nobody would turn a hair\\". Coldstream argued that \\"The time was right for a thought-provoking and compelling drama that would confront viewers with the consequences of the death penalty\\", after UK polls in June and September that year had shown more than 50% of Britons supported bringing back capital punishment. During filming the actor playing Glitter (Hilton McRae) walked onto set and was hissed at and insulted when the crowd thought it was the real Glitter. Coldstream said that: > When we'd decided to make a film exploring how society deals with its most > reviled offenders, we hadn't expected it to be an easy ride. But this was > confirmation that we were tapping into a raw nerve [...] When we covertly > filmed an actor outside the Old Bailey displaying a banner reading 'Honk for > hanging', the cacophony of car horns was sobering. Then there was the time > we approached members of the public to stand in as extras. 'Glitter? > Executed? Should have done it years ago, mate. Count me in.' And we're not > talking about hooligans with H.A.T.E tattooed on their foreheads, we're > talking about business people, dinner ladies and door-to-door salesmen; in > other words, us. Coldstream said that \\"the idea was to force viewers to explore their own impulses ‚Äì as individuals and communities ‚Äì over how we deal with society's most reviled offenders in a way that was challenging and disturbing.\\" He also felt that the programme was necessary to show \\"how easily individuals and communities adjust to the new morality once it has been sanctioned by authority.\\" Reception The programme was described by the Radio Times as \\"a strange, often repellent film\\". John Preston in The Daily Telegraph considered it to be \\"One of the most stupid dramas I have ever seen on television.\\"John Preston \\"\\", Daily Telegraph, 13 November 2009 Writing in November 2009, he continued: \\"Quite why the death penalty should have been reintroduced for sexual offences, especially those ‚Äì as in Glitter‚Äôs case ‚Äì that were committed abroad was never, perhaps wisely, gone into.\\" Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe Review of the Year 2009 harshly criticised the programme, remarking that it \\"constructed a complex moral maze from a serious issue, then drove a bus full of squawking clowns through the middle of it,\\" and concluded, \\"That's certainly made me think ‚Äì it's made me think, 'I don't know if I want a television any more'.\\" Kathryn Flett, writing in The Observer newspaper shortly after the broadcast, described it as a \\"deeply unsavoury docu-drama hybrid which [...] was not merely offensive ‚Äì hell, I'm all for offensive ‚Äì but offensively ill conceived\\". She argued that the programme had let down any possibility of asking \\"proper grown-up questions about capital punishment\\" by electing to pick a particularly sensationalist subject. She felt that this led the producers to \\"fatally undermine the premise\\". Her attitude towards the acting was more positive, \\"plaudits however must go to Hilton McRae, whose doppelganger performance as Paul Gadd was brilliantly unnerving.\\" Ofcom complaint Glitter (Paul Gadd) lodged a complaint with Ofcom about the show, alleging unfair treatment. The complaint was not upheld. Glitter claimed that \\"a reasonable viewer might have concluded that [he] had committed 'terrible crimes which have gone unpunished and stated that he \\"was never prosecuted in Vietnam for child rape.\\" Channel 4 stated that the programme \\"was not sensationalist and was not intended to be forensic examination of Mr Gadd's sexual activities\\" and that \\"the programme did set out Mr Gadd's real life convictions, but did not suggest that the fictional Mr Gadd had committed or had been convicted of any crime but not punished for it.\\" They also went on to say that \\"the fictional nature of the programme was emphasised by a number of factors [...] the blending of fact and fiction is not a new technique and that viewers were well used to engaging with the technique\\". Ofcom initially upheld the complaint in their provisional decision. Channel 4 appealed for a review, which was carried out by the Broadcasting Review Committee (BRC). The BRC noted that Glitter had stated his position as unfairly being denied an opportunity to refute the claim that he \\"was a child rapist\\"; however, they \\"did not consider that this was a fair interpretation\\" of Channel 4's intent, which \\"focused on the effect of the programme on viewer's perceptions of Mr Gadd.\\" They also felt that no real allegations had been made against the \\"real Mr Gadd. As such, the committee did not consider that Channel 4 was obliged to give Mr Gadd an opportunity to respond.\\" The BRC watched an excerpt of the programme and felt that DCI Crane was clearly a fictional character, and that the fictional charges of child rape were made by that clearly fictional character. They thus felt that any viewer would see the programme as a fictional one, and that \\"The Committee noted that further mention of the specific charge of child rape in the programme was always in a clearly fictional context. Consequently, viewers would not have come to the conclusion that Mr Gadd was guilty of more serious crimes which had gone unpunished.\\" The BRC felt that \\"In view of Mr Gadd's well-publicised reputation in relation to child sex offences, the Committee considered that there was likely to be little scope for additional damage to his reputation in relation to his sexual activities that would result in unfairness to him.\\" and that they felt \\"the programme was a fictional drama and that it would have been clear to viewers that this was the case.\\" They concluded by stating that \\"The Committee concluded that in these particular set of circumstances there was no unfairness to Mr Gadd in the programme as broadcast.\\" See also *The Taking of Prince Harry References External links * Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:Political mockumentaries Category:Films about capital punishment Category:Gary Glitter Category:2009 in England Category:2009 television films Category:England in fiction Category:Hanging in fiction ","title":"The Execution of Gary Glitter"},{"id":"24970997","text":"Blyth Harbour Wind Farm is a coastal wind farm located in East Bedlington along the East Pier of the Port of Blyth.

It won the reliability prize. Design and development The CLA.2 was the first aircraft completed by the Cranwell Light Aeroplane (CLA) club, formed in 1923 by staff and students at the RAF College Cranwell. The students came from No.4 Apprentices Wing and one of their lecturers, Flt-Lt Nicholas Comper, became chief designer of the three aircraft produced by the club as well as one, the CLA.1, that was not finished. The immediate target was the Lympne Two Seater Light Aeroplane Trials of 1924, but the emphasis was on producing a robust machine that could be simply built and maintained at low cost, suitable for flying schools. It was built from wood and fabric covered throughout. Though it probably had the shortest flying career of any of the CLA's aircraft, it was one of the most profitable. The Cranwell CLA.2 (or Cranwell II as it sometimes appears)Flight 25 September 192 p.599-601 was a largely conventional two-seat single-engined biplane, with some unusual features. It was a single bay sesquiplane the lower wing having an area only 52% of the upper one. As a result of the different spans, the interplane struts leant strongly outwards. The interplane gap was unusually large, with the aim of reducing interference effects between the wings; these deleterious interplane effects were still not widely appreciated in 1924. The wings lacked stagger and sweep; both had constant chord and ailerons were carried on both wings, with their own internal control runs. The CL.2 was a two-seater (with dual controls as required by the Lympne competition rules) with pilot and pupil sitting side by side under the forward part of the upper wing, and as a result the fuselage was broad at this point (3 ft 9 in or 1.14 m), broader than it was deep. Another consequence was that the centre section struts from the upper wing to the fuselage top longerons were unusually widely spaced, a spacing enhanced by a slight outward lean. The wings did not fold but could be rapidly removed for transport. The fuselage was flat-sided, built up around four longerons which were made of spruce at the rear and ash forward of the cockpit. Behind the cockpit, the fuselage narrowed in plan view in a gently curved way to the tail, but less usually Comper made the fuselage reduce in depth also; whilst the upper longeron was horizontal with the aircraft in flying position, the lower one was angled upwards. The fin and rudder formed an approximate quadrant, though the unbalanced rudder extended down between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. The nearly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron. A standard curved decking, built up with stringers over frames topped the fuselage from front to rear. Forward of the cockpit the lower longerons curved strongly upwards and inwards, meeting the now inward curving upper members at the engine bulkhead, on which was mounted the 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub I flat-twin driving a two-bladed small diameter propeller. The single axle undercarriage was mounted on a pair of short V-shaped legs, each V cut out of plywood and mounted vertically on the lower longerons, so that the track was about 4 ft (1.22 m). The CLA.2 sat close to the ground, with its wheels only slightly ahead of and below the wing leading edge. The CLA. 2 first flew, with its designer at the controls, on 14 September 1924. The Lympne competition began two weeks later, with the elimination trials on 27‚Äì8 September.Flight 2 October 1924 p.631-40 Labelled as aircraft No.3 and registered as G-EBKCRegistration documents for G-EBKC the CLA.2 completed these successfully, but like several other aircraft failed to complete all the speed and takeoff tests, coming sixth out of seven overall.Flight 9 October 1924 p.650-9 It did, however fly for nearly 18 hours and covered more than 760 miles (1,250 km), winning the valuable ¬£300 reliability prize. After the light plane trials the CLA.2 went to RAF Martlesham Heath. It was written off by an Air Ministry pilot sometime before 20 May 1925. The Air Ministry compensated the CLA club for this loss. No more CLA.2s were built, but the prize money and the compensation helped to fund the CLA club's next aircraft, the Cranwell CLA.3.

Issues in the case were considered sufficiently important as to make it to the United States Supreme Court as Armstrong vs American Exchange National Bank. The business was reorganized with an injection of new capital from the Kershaw family. Howard Cranston Potter Charles Kershaw's daughter Alice was married to Howard Cranston Potter whose grandfather was James Brown among the founders of Brown Bros. & Co. and whose father Howard Potter was the senior partner in Brown, Shipley & Co.. Rather than join the family business Howard C. Potter invested in and joined Kershaw & Co. and operated a branch from Tacoma, Washington. C.J. Kershaw & Sons In addition to the commission business carried on by the above-named firm, Mr. Kershaw, commenced 1875 another copartnership which carried on an extensive trade in lumber and salt. C.J. Kershaw & Sons were dealers in lumber, salt stucco, lime, etc. The lumber yards were located on the north side of Burnham's Slip, near the foot of Sixth avenue. This area of Milwaukee is currently as of 2009 Clock Tower Acres. The business was established by proprietors in 1875. A directory published in 1881 describes the business. From fifty to seventy-five men were employed about the extensive yards. The sales aggregate was nearly of lumber per year. This branch of the business was under the management of R. Stockwell, Jr., who had been superintendent of the yards since 1877. The house, with office at No. 68 West Water street, under a separate management, nearly controlled the salt trade of the city, and had a large shipping trade with the interior. This department conducting salt trade was under the superintendency of P.H. Kershaw, the junior partner of the house. Northwestern Grain Elevator In 1876 he also entered into copartnership with Charles Manegold, Jr. under the firm name of C. Manegold, Jr. & Co., the firm owning and running the Northwestern Elevator. These varieties of business under the different styles mentioned being successfully and energetically carried on by Mr. Kershaw and his associates. He was an honored member of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce since 1861, and has served on every important committee, and as Vice-President of the Board. His reputation and business standing among his associates is untarnished, and his ability unquestioned. Family Mr. Kershaw married Miss Mary E.

One of these was vessels was named after him, a wooden steamer of 1,324 gross tons, long, wide and draft which continued under the name C.J. Kershaw after it was sold. It passed through various owners and in and out then back into the ownership of William Mack. It was built in 1874 at Bay City, Michigan. It foundered in a storm on Chocolay Reef off Marquette, Michigan on Lake Superior on the night of September 29, 1895. Due to the action of lifesavers none of the thirteen aboard died. As a result of its location it is one of the most popular dive sites in Northern Michigan.

History Commissioned in December 2000 as a pilot project, the project was developed by a consortium that included E.ON, Shell Renewables, NUON and Border Wind. E.ON were in charge of operating the farm. The project was the UK's first offshore wind farm, following the Vindeby in 1991 and Tun√∏ in 1995, as well as being the largest offshore turbines erected in the world at the time.http://www.power- technology.com/projects/blyth/ It helped pave the way for more than 600 bigger offshore turbines installed in British waters since then. The wind farm was scheduled for decommissioning (as required by authorities) in 2019. One turbine went for spare parts, while the other was re-erected as a training facility in Blyth harbour. There are plans to add a 100 MW test facility of 15 turbines at Blyth and nearby Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, supported by a government grant. The site would be administered by The National Renewable Energy Centre (Narec), based in Blyth. The test facility received planning consent in November 2013. It is planned with the Vestas V164-8MW and 66 kV cables. The turbines have been decommissioned and replaced with five turbines further off shore. Design and specification The farm consisted of two Vestas 2 MW turbines. The gravity based foundation (GBF) was the concrete foundation for the wind turbines that was produced on land, in a dry dock. The self-floating GBF was floated to its destination and then immersed by ballasting it with water and sand. The GBF sat firmly on the sea bed and the wind turbine is then installed on this foundation. These foundations were 30 metres in diameter and had a 60 metre long shaft.

Plot People say one‚Äôs fate has been pre-determined from the start like the cards in a Texas Hold‚Äôem game. Uno (Lau Ching Wan), a small-time crook turned casino magnate, and Jack, the scion of a powerful gaming clan lead very different lives until fate brought them together in a poker duel of a lifetime. The setting is Macau, Las Vegas of the Orient, where the buzz in town is that Uno has snared the operations of the venerable Sun Casinos from its deceased owner. In a bid to clear his name, he has the sole heir Jack (Louis Koo) brought back from Canada where he spent the last few years in hiding. Jack, an inept businessman and a socially awkward young man, spent his days playing online poker. When it became clear that he has neither the instinct nor the skills to take over, Uno invokes the owner‚Äôs will and takes charge of Jack's family business. Disillusioned and depressed, Jack runs into Smiley (Stephy Tang), a simple girl with a seemingly unstoppable good fortune. Together the pair conquers the poker rooms in Macau. Jack played in Uno's arch rival Ms. Fong's (Josie Ho) casino and met her. He requested to represent her casino in the ultimate Poker King tournament to beat Uno. As Jack issues a personal challenge to Uno, it becomes clear that it isn't only bragging rights at stake, but also the throne to the gambling empire that Jack‚Äôs father had built. In the Poker King Tournament, Jack and Uno reached the final round along with Uno's henchmen. To build up Uno's playing chips, all the henchmen purposely lost to Uno leaving Jack to face Uno as the last two players. In the last game, Jack and Uno had the same set of cards but of different suits. The last card dealt out gave Jack the victory and he also reclaimed back his father's casino. It was revealed via several flashbacks, Uno built up the casino with Jack's father and the casino was to be passed down to Jack. However, if Jack is incapable, Uno will inherit the casino. However, Uno added a condition that he will only inherit the casino if Jack remains a good-for- nothing. Jack also revealed that he was also a competent poker player all along under the tutelage of a master poker player but feigned weakness to assess Uno's competence at managing the casino. With renewed respect for each other, they became friends and Uno was eventually rehired by Jack as the casino group's CEO while Jack will travel around the world with his teacher and participate in various poker tournament.

(1829 ‚Äì 10 May 1913), was a prominent Scottish collector of art and oriental ceramics, illustrator and landscape watercolourist. The scale of his involvement with the art trade and with top collectors such as John Ruskin is highlighted in the large two volume set of books published about him by Byron Webber: published in London, Chatto and Windus 1903: James Orrock R.I., Painter, Connoisseur, Collector. Rather than being a forger as some modern scholars like to believe Orrock was a dedicated enthusiast of contemporary British art and emulated some of those artists in his own work. He illustrated three books in the style of Turner: Mary Queen-of-Scots, 1906; Old England : her story mirrored in her scenes, 1908; and, In the Border country, 1906. Life James was the son of James Orrock, an Edinburgh surgeon, dentist and druggist, living at 17 Elm Row at the top of Leith Walk. The family moved to 2 York Place when he was young.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1840 He was educated in medicine, surgery, and dentistry at Edinburgh University, after which he practised as a dentist in Nottingham. Orrock studied painting under James Ferguson, William L. Leitch, and John Burgess, later enrolling at the Nottingham School of Design where he was taught by Thomas Stuart Smith. He settled in London by 1866, becoming an associate of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1871, exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy and Royal Academy. His later style was highly influenced by David Cox, his paintings today are on show in various museums and galleries, including the Victoria and Albert Museum. A strong advocate of J. M. W. Turner and British art in general (owning several of J.M.W Turner's most important works), he was also an impassioned collector of Adam-style furniture decorated by Angelica Kauffman. A landscape painter and watercolourist, he is now believed to have restored, altered and improved works by other painters within his collection. Orrock created art-period rooms in his house, which he opened to the general public. Having on two previous occasions bought furniture and paintings from Orrock's personal collection, on Orrock's death Lord Leverhulme bought most of his art collection, and some one thousand of his own paintings. Part of that collection was used to create the Lady Lever Art Gallery at Port Sunlight. Today, Orrock is also notable as having commissioned many of the copies associated with the works of John Constable. His association with one copy of A Sea Beach Brighton painting by Constable was featured on the BBC One's Fake or Fortune? in January 2014.BBC One Fake or Fortune episode 2/4, broadcast 26 January 2014 Thomas Griffith, Turner's friend and agent/dealer was one of the executors of his estate. The artist gifted a very large early sea peace \\"Shipwreck, the Rescue\\" 161 x 222 cm. to Griffith (presumably the documented \\"Stormy Picture\\" they had discussed, in need of cleaning and restoring c1844). This sea piece was one of the earliest, if not the first of Turner's monumental sea piece series, c1801-02. He was only 26 at the time and this series made his fame early on. \\"Shipwreck, the Rescue' passed from Sir J.C. Robinson, surveyor of Queen Victoria's pictures, then to James Orrock Esq.

Biography Chalker was born in London, the son of a railway stationmaster who had been awarded the MBE for his work in World War One. After attending Alleyn's School in Dulwich and training in graphics and painting at Goldsmiths College, Chalker won a scholarship to the Painting School of the Royal College of Art in London. However, Chalker was conscripted into the British Army before he could take up his scholarship. A Ward in the Chungkai Hospital (Art.IWM ARTLD 6652) While serving in Singapore as a bombardier with the Royal Field Artillery in February 1942, Chalker was captured by the invading Japanese forces during the fall of Singapore. Chalker was held as a prisoner of war, first in Changi prison then two labour camps before being sent to work on the Burma Railway. On a part of the line in Kanchanaburi, Chalker used stolen paper and other materials to record the torture, malnutrition and illnesses endured by the prisoners. Although he risked being badly beaten, or worse, for doing so he managed to produce, and keep hidden, over one hundred paintings and drawings during his captivity between 1942 and 1945. He met the Australian surgeon Colonel Edward Dunlop in 1944 and agreed, again at great personal risk, to make detailed records of the prisoner's medical conditions to help Dunlop in his work. When released in 1945, Chalker spent some time at the Australian Army HQ in Bangkok working as an official war artist. Chalker's works, together with those of fellow POW artists Philip Meninsky, Ashley George Old and Ronald Searle form a unique record of prisoners' suffering during the building of the railway and were used in evidence at the subsequent Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. Many of these paintings are now located at the Australian War Memorial and the Imperial War Museum. In 1995 an exhibition of the works of the four artists was held at the State Library of Victoria under the title 'The Major Arthur Moon Collection'. Chalker returned to England at the end of 1945 and he graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1946. He was appointed Director of Art at the Cheltenham Ladies College and also worked as a visiting tutor at the Cheltenham College of Printing. In 1950 he became the Principal of Falmouth College of Art and after some years working as an advisor in local government Chalker took the same post at the West of England College of Art in Bristol in 1958. When that college became part of Bristol Polytechnic in 1969 Chalker became Head of the Faculty of Art and Design in the new institution and retained that post until he retired in 1974. Chalker also worked as a medical illustrator, made anatomical models for a medical company and was elected a fellow of the Society of Medical Artists of Great Britain. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of the West of England in 2003. Ill-health resulting from his wartime treatment led to Chalker selling many of his Burma sketches in 2002 in an auction that gained worldwide attention.

It has 24 locations and serves American, Japanese, Chinese, Okinawan, and Hawaiian fusion food. One of their best-selling items is chili.  History  On October 17, 1966, brothers Francis and Charles Higa opened the first Zippy's on South King Street in Honolulu, Hawaii. At first, the Higa brothers were going to open a car wash, but they ended up creating a restaurant. The kitchen was located in the back of the Zippy's McCully fast food operation. At the time, the zip code was gaining popularity because it was a faster and more efficient way for mail to arrive. The Higa brothers liked the idea of zip codes and they wanted their restaurant to have the same kind of service, so they named the restaurant Zippy's. Francis and Charlie bought mostly freestanding buildings so that they could stay open for 24 hours, attracting many late-night customers. At the time that Zippy's was first created, a lot of Okinawan mom and pop restaurants were around. There weren't many mainland fast food chains in Hawaii at that time either. At that time, Spencecliff, Andy Wong (Byron's), and Zippy's were the only fast food restaurants around. Because of the competition, the Higa brothers decided on selling a variety of local foods.‚ÄúHigas Still Run Zippy‚Äôs as a Family Business,‚Äù Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 29 September 2002, retrieved on 17 November 2014 On November 19, 1983, Napoleon's Bakery opened its doors, due to the fact that Zippy's wanted to try something different. They wanted to make the restaurant a one-stop shop, so that when the customer were done with their dinner, they could order a dessert. Because of the bakery's opening, the sales at Zippy's increased. The founders, Francis and Charles Higa, created FCH Enterprise, Inc. in May 2002. Francis and Charles had different personalities and took on different roles to make the business successful.Jeanine Mamiya-Kalahiki, Marketing Director of Zippy's and Jeff Bercasio, Creative Specialist of Zippy's, interview by Joevondis Collier, Ku‚Äôulei Yamamoto, Honolulu, HI, November 7, 2014. Francis determined the direction of the company, while Charles made most of the operational decisions and handled all food and paper purchases. To this present day, Charles is happily retired and well. However, Francis died on March 25, 1999. Francis' son, Jason Higa, is now the current CEO of FCH Enterprises, Inc. When Zippy's Kaimuki restaurant opened, Charles would transport huge pots of chili in his station wagon.Bob, Sigall.

Now, food is being prepared by Food Solutions International in Waipio and is sent to the different Zippy's around the islands. Menu Zippy's is open 24 hours and offers a wide variety of food combining American, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Hawaiian cuisinethat is, what people who live in Hawaii call \\"local\\" cuisine. One of their signature dishes when they first opened was the Zip-min. Its signature food is their chili. Zippy's sells 110 tons of it every month through their stores, fund raising activities, and in retail markets. Along with their chili, Zippy's sells a variety of plate lunches such as the Zip Pac and the Surf Pac. The Zip Pac was introduced in May 1971 and the Surf Pac was introduced a little while after in May 1985.

Smith, Dehlinger, Laval, Henriot; top row: Gaspart, Lomer, Cottrell, Homes, Curien Yvette Cauchois (; 19 December 1908 - 19 November 1999) was a French physicist known for her contributions to x-ray spectroscopy and x-ray optics, and for pioneering European synchrotron research.  Education  Cauchois attended school in Paris, and pursued undergraduate studies at the Sorbonne who awarded her a degree in the physical sciences in July 1928. Cauchois undertook graduate studies at the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry with the support of a National Fund for Science studentship, and was awarded her doctorate in 1933 for her work on the use of curved crystals for high-resolution x-ray analysis.  Academic career  After completing her doctoral studies, Cauchois was appointed research assistant in the laboratory of Jean Perrin at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS). She was promoted to research associate in 1937, and in the same year participated in the launch of the Palais de la D√©couverte. In January 1938 Cauchois was named head of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory in the Faculty of Sciences of Paris. When World War Two broke out, Cauchois maintained continuity at the Laboratory, acting as Head of Studies when Jean Perrin had to flee to the United States. In 1945, when the Liberation led to the dismissal of Louis Dunoyer de Segonzac, Cauchois was promoted to Professor at the Sorbonne. She became Chair of Chemical Physics in 1954, succeeding Edmond Bauer to take charge of the laboratory. With the number of researchers outgrowing the available space in the Laboratory, Cauchois founded the Centre de Chimie Physique at Orsay in 1960. She directed this organisation for ten years, whilst simultaneously continuing her work at the Sorbonne. She joined the University of Paris VI in 1971 following the division of the Sorbonne. Cauchois chaired the French Society of Physical Chemistry from 1975‚Äì1978. She was only the second woman to do so, after Marie Curie. From 1978 until her retirement in 1983, Cauchois was Professor Emeritus at the University of Paris VI. Cauchois was still conducting active laboratory research as late as 1992 (aged 83). Over her lifetime she produced more than 200 publications, which continue to be cited today.  Research on x-rays and crystals  In the early 1930s, Cauchois established the fundamental principles of a new x-ray spectrometer that was both easy to use and had a high resolution, satisfying the Bragg reflection condition. The new spectrometer was named after her, and from 1934 she used it to observe gas emissions and multiplets. The new technique was used around the world for the analysis of x-rays and gamma rays and prompted a wave of new scholarship in radiation studies. Cauchois pioneered developments in x-ray imaging and observed that x-ray radiation could be focused using curved crystal for use in monochromators and x-ray scattering. Cauchois' work on soft x-ray distributions was the first step in determining the photo-absorption spectra. She used the radiation reflected from crystals to study the electronic structure of materials. Cauchois systematically studied the x-ray spectra of heavy elements and actinides. In 1936, Cauchois and Horia Hulubei claimed to have discovered element 85 via X-ray analysis, conducting further research and publishing on follow-up studies in 1939. Cauchois, Sonia Cotelle, and Hulubei proved the presence of polonium and neptunium, and Cauchois later pioneered studies on the x-ray spectra of transuranic elements. A fascination with astrophysics led Cauchois to study extraterrestrial x-ray radiation, especially the solar x-ray spectrum using missile experiments. In 1970 she produced x-ray images of the sun.  Synchrotron and solar research  From 1962, Cauchois initiated a research programme in collaboration with the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati to explore the possibilities of synchrotron research. She was the first person in Europe to realise the potential of the radiation emitted by electrons rotating in the synchrotron as a source for understanding the properties of matter. In the early 1970s, Cauchois carried out her experiments at LURE (Laboratoire pour l'utilisation des radiations √©lectromagn√©tiques).  Personal life and death  Cauchois was particularly interested in assisting young and underprivileged people. She also enjoyed poetry and music, and was a skilled grand piano player. After meeting a priest from the monastery of B√¢rsana and discussing religious themes with him, Cauchois decided to be baptized in the Orthodox religion.

These people are an Igbo speaking ethnic group, whose early history is adversely affected by a lack of, or non-existent, written records. Umuoji is bounded by Ogidi, Ojoto, Uke, Abatete and Nkpor and has an estimated population of 80,000 people which includes local residents in its 23 villages and citizens in diaspora. Origin myth Two possible sources about Umuoji origin have been postulated. Both apparently are derived from oral tradition. The first, more widely held, is that Umuoji people originated from a man called Okodu, who was a descendant of a man called Nri. Another is that one Okoli Oti from Arochukwu was the ancestor of Umuoji. In those early days, only the people of Arochukwu (Umuchukwu meaning Children of Supreme God) and Nri, who were also regarded as sacred people or mediators between men and the gods, were free to travel about and they were the two predominant sets of people who were known throughout the then Igbo nation. The Aro people were great warriors with sophisticated weapons that gave them a military advantage over the other inhabitants of the Igbo nation. Consequently, one great warrior, Okoli Oti from Arochukwu is believed to have set out in company of his followers to visit the famous Eze Nri (the great king of Nri). His intention was not that friendly but on reaching the Nri Kingdom, he changed his mind as a result of what he heard and saw about the Nri people. Okoli later decided to settle near the kingdom of his host and thereby found his own kingdom. He settled in the present area inhabited by Abatete people. Okoli later married a woman from Nri town. Some of his men never went back to their places of origin. They also raised up families later known as Isiuzo, Azu, Owa, Akwa, Oraofia and Mputu. Okoli Oti brought with him three deities named Ezeigwe, Oji and Ogwugwu. He begat three sons and some daughters. The sons were Ezeogu, Ora and Idike. Ezeogu was the father of the Abatete people, otherwise known as Abatete Ezeogu. Ora the second son was the father of the Umuoji people, while Idike was the father of the Nkpor people. Ora Okoli had a son named Okodu and some daughters whose names were not known as nobody bothered to trace the lineage of women in Igboland then. Okodu is the father of Oji; he named him after his father's deity which he(Okodu) later inherited. Oji in turn begat Ora II whom he named after his grandfather. From mythology, Ora II had two wives - each of whom had two sons. The sons were Ezi, Ifite, Echem and Akala. Ezi and Echem were of the same mother, while Ifite and Akala were of the same mother. These made up the quarters of Umuoji and the villages therein. From the various accounts on the origin of the three towns, the name of Okolie Otie, an itinerant trader from Arochukwu, appears a common denominator in the origin legends of the people. What appears to be significantly but regrettably missing from the various accounts, seems to be the name of the mother of the progenitors of the three communities. Few observations are however pertinent to these accounts. One is that as far as the Arochukwu connection is concerned, striking flaws are apparent which calls for further investigation and reassessment. As noted by Ekpunobi (1998), ‚Äúthe story is an attempt by local historians to link Umuoji with the once famous Arochukwu trading expedition‚Äù. This position is borne out by the fact that as present, there is not yet any evidence of Aro-Abatete- Umuoji-Nkpor connection either in their usages, customs, or traditions. On the other hand, the story linking these communities to Nri appears to enjoy more acceptability. As noted by Ekpunobi (1988) and strongly supported by Nwosu (2013) ‚Äúbefore the advent of the Europeans, Nkpor-Umuoji-Abatete went to Eze Nri to pay their Nru (annual homage)‚Äù. Tradition affirms that the tribute were paid in recognition of the ‚Äúfatherly role Nri was playing towards the three communities‚Äù and in recognition of the fact that Nri was their original home. To further lend credence to this evidence on Nri origin of the three communities, Onwuejeogwu (1972) observed that in the past, the power and authority of Eze Nri were based on the belief of many Igbo settlements that Eze Nri had spiritual authority over them. Ilozue (1966), in his work-Umuoji Cultural Heritage-wrote equally that \\"the chief of Nri is the only person who can announce or denounce the sacredness of anything in Umuoji\\". The analyses of the study of the three communities doubtless have shown that they share a common putative progenitor, upon which the need to institute a common meeting ground for the three communities for identification. In this respect, a consideration may be made by the leadership of the three communities on the re-enactment and celebration of the almost moribund feast called the OMA-NNE. Leadership The quarters and villages in Umuoji in order of seniority are as follows; * Eziora ** Aboh ** Umuobia (also known as Ukpabia) ** Ire ** Amoji ** Ekwulu ** Urueze * Ifiteora ** Ifite ** Uruedeke ** Umuoli ** Umuazu * Dimechem ** Agumaelum ** Umuoma ** Uruaneke ** Dimboko ** Umuechem ** Urumkpu ** Dianaokwu ** Ideoma * Akala ** Uruegbe ** Akalaetiti ** Aguma ** Anogu ** Abidi Formerly, Umuoji had twenty five villages until Umunzulu was merged into Amoji while Umuokezi joined Ideoma. Due to the number of Oji's children and grandchildren, Umuoji was referred to as Igwulube Okodu (Igwulube means locust). Before now, the Umuoji kingship rotated among the five villages of Eziora quarter, being the first son that inherits the father's Obi in Igbo tradition and custom. Umuoji's kingship involves both a traditional Eze and an Igwe. The current Eze of Umuoji is Eze Dr. Joseph Ifeanyichukwu Obadike (Ezedim II), from Abor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPUaeSS_TE He is a retired engineer and businessman who lived in America. He was preceded by Eze Dr. Gilbert Odikpo Obadike, a surgeon and medical director from Abor.http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/20885851/310661970/name/Dr.Obadike_PDF_profile.pdf The present Igwe of Umuoji, HRH Dr Cyril Enweze (Ebubedike I), a renowned economist who retired from the IMF as Director Of Operations IFAD and Vice President of ADB, is from Ifite in the Ifiteora quarter having succeeded Igwe Akum Micheal A. Nweze(Anumili I) who came from Ire in the Eziora quarter. Each village is headed by an Ichie and the council of Ndi Ichie form the Igwe's Cabinet, and the political leadership of the village is headed by the chairman of the village Uka-Oye, which is the supreme administrative body of the village. Other traditional institutions in Umuoji are the Nze-na-Ozo, Age Grades, Umuofia, Umuokpu and Umuada etc. There is also the Umuoji Improvement Union which sees to the day-to-day governance of the town and the Umuoji Women Association and branches of the town union. Culture There are three major festivals among others celebrated by the Umuoji people. The most important are the Ofala Festival, which is traditionally celebrated by the Igwe at least once every three years and the Uzoiyi Festival, which is usually celebrated in March and kicks off the farming season. It ends with a spectacle of colorful and monumental masquerades for entertainment, each presented by one of the villages in Umuoji are Akwanechenyi (Aboh village), Egbenu Oba (Anogu village), Nyakwulu (Aguma village), Agu (Agumaelum village), Enyi (Abidi village), Zebra (Dimboko village), Ugo and Aja Agba Agu Mgba (Urumkpu village), Igada (Uruegbe village), Ibubo (Ekwulu village), Obamili (Umuoli village), Nkenekwu (Ire village), Agaba (Uruaneke village), Ene (Urueze village), Odum (Urudeke village), Ochamili (Ideoma village), Ijele (Umuobia village), Atu (Amoji village), Aguiyi (Umuoma village), Oma Mbala (Akala-Etiti village), Akwa Ugo (Ifite village), Akum Gbawalu Ugbo (Dianokwu village), Ana Eli Aku (Umuechem village), Inyinya (Umuazu village). The Mbajekwe festival ushers in the Ili Ji Ofuu (New Yam Festival), is celebrated in August‚ÄìSeptember. There are other feasts in between that are celebrated by the villages that make up Umuoji town. The majority of the people had historically been subsistence farmers but now are in all fields of human endeavor. Notable places in Umuoji include the Iba Oji in Ifite village, the Amangwu and Udume shrines in Aboh village, the Ideakpulu stream located in Umuoma and Ideoma villages, the Ezi Ebenebe shrine in Akalaetiti village and Iba Aroli in Umuobia village. The early Catholic Christian missionaries to Umuoji established the popular Mater Amabilis Secondary School for Girls, Our Lady's Catholic Church and St Francis Catholic Church/primary School. Umuoji has nine public primary schools and two secondary schools including the Boys High School, established in 1975, which was renamed to Community Secondary School and made co-ed in 2008. Another cultural belief of the Umuoji people is to honor Eke (the Python), which is dedicated to the river deity, Idemili. It is considered a sacrilege for a citizen or a visitor to kill a python; should this happen, the perpetrator must bury the python with funeral rites normally reserved for human beings.

FCBC is a charismatic church that is socially conservative.\\"FCBC: Characteristic\\" , Retrieved 5 October 2009 In 2012, the Faith Community Baptist Church fired a member of the church staff on \\"moral grounds\\" because of her adulterous relationship with a married church worker. As the Employment Act of Singapore states that an expectant mother from her fourth month of pregnancy must be paid benefits if she is sacked without sufficient cause, the church was made to pay the sacked employee $7,000 in salary and benefits. In 2017, the church opened an arts hub at Bukit Merah Central. The nine-storey building includes a performance venue Gateway Theatre, which is rented out to arts groups on weekdays and used for church services on weekends.

He has also actively protested against the annual Singapore gay pride event Pink Dot SG, and has supported the counter-campaign and encouraged his followers to speak out against the normalisation of homosexual relationships in Singapore. Support for Creationism In 2016, Khong was noted to have delivered a series of sermons at Faith Community Baptist Church, saying Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution was \\"a real deception from the Devil\\". The church's support for creationism in its pulpit and on its social media channels prompted a discussion on the spread of the idea by certain groups of Christian evangelicals in secular Singapore.

They use toy musical instruments and other noise-making toys to perform their own compositions as well as interpretations of works by other artists, from Dvo≈ô√°k to Black Flag. Toychestra have performed at several venues in the San Francisco Bay Area and have toured Europe three times. They have released three CDs, including a collaborative album, What Leave Behind with English experimental guitarist Fred Frith. History Toychestra began as a once-off experiment in 1996 at a women's festival of experimental music at Hotel Utah in San Francisco. Among the original members were Mary George, Paula Alexander, Lexa Walsh and Shari Robertson. Walsh described their first rehearsal: \\"we got together and brought our regular instruments, and I brought some toys too. We tried both, and the toys definitely won.\\" They started improvising with the toys and within a two weeks they had put together a set. Toychestra played at a variety of venues, from experimental music spaces and rock clubs, to schools and community centers. They arranged and performed \\"symphonic miniatures\\" using toy musical instruments, including tiny pianos, recorders, bugles, drum sets and xylophones, plus other noise making toys, like pink zoo trains and jack-in-the-boxes. They also used a variety of found objects for percussive sounds. Contact microphones were attached to each \\"instrument\\" for amplification and the feeds were mixed live during their performances. They dressed up in \\"dime-store costumes: bridal gowns, superhero outfits, and cowgirl regalia\\" with \\"future-shock hairdos and fluorescent wigs\\". The San Francisco Bay Guardian described Toychestra as an \\"ongoing experiment in na√Øve sound.\\" Composer Dan Plonsey from the San Francisco Bay Area Improv Scene first got to know Toychestra in 1998 when he booked them at his Beanbender's music venue in Berkeley, California. He liked their eccentric style and decided to combine their creative talents with those of fellow Bay Area Improv Scene member and experimental guitarist, Fred Frith. Plonsey wrote a concerto for electric guitar and toy orchestra for Toychestra and Frith to perform, and it was recorded and released in 2004 on a CD, What Leave Behind. Toychestra went on to tour Europe several times, playing for the first time in large concert halls, and became quite popular in France. Later they began incorporating more conventional instruments like the melodica and kalimba to counteract the \\"shrillness\\" of the toy instruments. Since their inception, Toychestra went through a number of personnel changes with founding member Walsh remaining at the helm. Their first two releases were both self- published, an eponymous 7\\" vinyl single in 1999, and a CD, Live in Leipzig in 2000. This was followed by three CDs on the French label, S.K.

In 200 BC, Cycliadas being made strategos instead of Philopoemen, the Spartan king Nabis took advantage of the change to make war on the Achaeans. Philip offered to help them, and to carry the war into the enemy's country, if they would give him a sufficient number of their soldiers to garrison Chalcis, Oreus and Corinth in the meantime. The Achaeans however mistrusted Philip, and suspected that it was a ploy to obtain hostages from them and so to force them into a war with the Romans. Cycliadas therefore answered, that their laws precluded them from discussing any proposal except that for which the assembly was summoned. In 199/8 BC, Cycliadas was expelled as a result of his position as leader of the pro-Macedonian party.Philopoemen By Robert Malcolm Errington Page 49 (1969) In 198 BC he was an exile at the court of Philip, whom he attended in that year at his conference with Flamininus at Nicaea in Locris.

History  Built in 1975 in a shipyard in Orange, Texas, the tug measured , displaced 99 tons and carried a crew of 7. She was last owned by S.C. Loveland Co. of Pennsville, New Jersey. Thomas Hebert had left Virginia for Maine on 5 March 1993, towing a barge carrying 8,500 tons of coal. She sank in of water off the New Jersey coast with the loss of five lives at 3am on Sunday 7 March 1993. The sunken vessel was found intact, still attached by a steel cable to the floating barge that she had been towing. The cable showed traces of metal from the hull of another vessel, suggesting that a submarine snagged the tow cable, pulling the tug under, in an incident similar to that of sinking the tugboat Barcona in 1989. Other theories included a faulty steering caused the tug to turn so suddenly and sharply that it took on water at the stern and sank itself. Another theory is that due to a mechanical failure the tug steered itself in a larger circle in the middle of the night and was passed, then pulled backward and under, by the barge it was towing. The latter is not an uncommon accident in the marine towing industry; it is known as tripping. An example of this happened May 11, 2001 when the 115' foot tugboat Bay Titan had her barge overtake her and pull her under while turning from the Delaware River to the entrance of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.

They play in the Yorkshire Regional Division of the Rugby League Conference. History Scunthorpe Braves were formed in 2006. The Braves joined the Midlands Merit League, playing competitive fixtures all over Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire, finally finishing 4th out of six teams in the league. The 2007 season saw the club reform as Scunthorpe Barbarians, join forces with Scunthorpe RUFC, operate out of Heslam Park and join the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Division of the Rugby League Conference. After winning the first game of the season against Rossington Sharks, it became a bit of a struggle for a win, with the elusive second win being picked up against Scarborough Pirates after the Barbarians were closely beaten by Lincoln City Knights. The club finished the season in 7th position out of 8, after winning two and drawing one of their twelve games. The 2008 season, once again saw the Barbarians play in the Rugby League Conference, with their division being reconstituted as the South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Division, with the furthest distance to travel being to Sheffield Forgers. There were victories against Sheffield Forgers and Rossington Sharks at Ashby, with the only away success of the season being at Rotherham Giants. An A-team was also entered into the RL Merit League. The 2009 season saw the Barbarians finally break through in the Rugby League Conference, losing only two games in the South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire division, these being to Parkside Hawks and Lincoln City Knights, drawing one, and winning seven on their way to qualifying for the end of season playoffs. This however was as far as their season went, as they were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by Rotherham Giants. 2010 sees the Barbarians playing in the Yorkshire Regional Division of the RLC, with themselves, Leeds Akkies and Lincoln City Knights being the longest serving clubs in this division. New teams representing Wetherby, Bradford Victoria, Shaw Cross and Barnsley coming into the division alongside them. Scunthorpe RLFC 2010 Fixtures The end of May 2010 saw the Barbarians move to a new playing facility at John Leggott College, Scunthorpe RLFC move to John Leggott College and were successful in their first ever fixture there, defeating Lincolnshire rivals Lincoln City Knights 36-34 through a last minute Will Scupham try.

Magic 93.1 was known for rotating songs such as \\"Here in My Heart\\", \\"Nookie\\", \\"The Saga Begins\\" among other tunes that missed the national charts would peak high in the nightly most requested. The station was typically an adult top 40 as it refrained from playing rap until the evening and overnight. The station also carried Casey Kasem's countdown show in the 1990s. In 2001 Magic brought a new sound which evolved to a Churban approach. Rock songs such as \\"It's Been A While\\", \\"The Middle\\" and \\"One last Breath\\" received airplay due to their high placement on the pop charts. The Rhythmic direction continued for five years then the station returned to an adult pop sound. Magic 93.1 signed off after a short tenure of hits now rhythmic direction at the end of the 2000s.

The station is currently owned by Community Public Media and managed by Radio Postville, Inc. History 89.1 KPVL is an independent, non-commercial community radio station that went on the air in December 2002 with a mission to meet the needs of Postville's diverse community. Programs produced in Hebrew, Spanish, and Russian provided Postville's emerging immigrant populations with a reliable link to community news, issues, and events. Other educational and public affairs shows celebrated local culture and served as a platform for community dialog & understanding. KPVL's main broadcast studio is now located in downtown Decorah and a second volunteer training / production studio is also maintained in Postville. A recently completed power increase to the station's transmitter now brings community radio to the greater four-county area of Northeast Iowa. Excerpt from 10/12/10 Decorah Newspaper Article: In 2002, Pastor Robert Hupp ‚Äî a Lutheran pastor and licensed broadcasting engineer who was working at KCZQ radio in Cresco ‚Äî was thinking it would be a great idea to start a non-profit, multi-lingual radio station in Postville. At the time, the small town was home not only to the descendants of the (mostly) Germans and (some) Scandinavians who'd settled it 150 years earlier but, more recently, to people from Mexico, Ukraine, and Russia ‚Äì in addition to a community of about 400 Hasidic Jews, all of whom made their way there after the arrival in 1987 of AgriProcessors, then the largest kosher slaughterhouse and meatpacking plant in the country. Into that multi-cultural context, ‚ÄúRadio Postville‚Äù ‚Äì 89.1 KPVL ‚Äì was born. One of a few pioneering radio stations in the country to broadcast in multiple languages, it featured talk shows, area news, weather updates, educational programs and music. Carolyn Corbin, now of Decorah, worked in Postville at the time and was a Radio Postville advisory board member. In a 2002 interview for The Tapestry magazine, she told reporter Elsa Carruthers about the board's vision for KPVL. ‚ÄúBesides having a place to tune into where people can hear their own language, there is also a place to share stories and to be able to broadcast in different languages as a way of getting to know about other cultures,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSort of a meeting place. A meeting place on the air.‚Äù In 2002, the 30-watt station could be heard only in Postville. When it went to 300 watts, where it remained for quite a while, it could be heard in some of the outlying areas around town, as well. And so it went until May 12, 2008 ‚Äî when Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a raid on AgriProcessors, arresting almost 400 undocumented workers. Two years later, a Decorah Newspapers article reported on a discussion of the raid's aftermath held at a public gathering in Decorah, during which Luther College Campus Pastor David V√°squez said Postville was still reeling from the effects of that raid. ‚ÄúThere are four pillars to any community ‚Äî the church, the town hall, schools and Main Street businesses,‚Äù V√°squez said. ‚ÄúAll of these were devastated by the raid.‚Äù Under the management of Jeff Abbas, KPVL's studio in Postville functioned for a while as a kind of clearinghouse for support and outreach in the community. Abbas helped people find work, ran a food pantry out of the station and kept news of the raid's ongoing effects on the air and in the public consciousness. But, said Adam Wiltgen, Station Manager from 2010 - 2012, ‚ÄúAfter the raid, the town‚Äôs capacity to support a radio station really eroded.‚Äù That's the bad news. The good news is that the future is looking brighter for the little community radio station that just won't give up. Though KPVL moved its main studio to Decorah in February 2010, it maintains a studio in Postville, broadcasts Postville High School Athletics, and also airs the popular ‚ÄúNoche Latina‚Äù ‚Äî hosted by longtime Spanish-language broadcaster Elmer Herrera, of Postville, and co-hosted by Israel Martinez and Walter Ortiz ‚Äì live, Saturday evenings, from 7 until 11. In 2015, KPVL ceased broadcasting.

Kristof. \\"Feudalism in Pakistan\\" The New York Times 1 August 2009 accessed: 7 February 2015 The adjective \\"feudal\\" in the context of Pakistan has been used to mean \\"a relatively small group of politically active and powerful landowners\\". \\"Feudal attitude\\" refers to \\"a combination of arrogance and entitlement\\". According to the Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research (PILER), five per cent of agricultural households in Pakistan own nearly two thirds of Pakistan's farmland. Large joint families in Pakistan may possess hundreds or even \\"thousands of acres\\" of land, while making little or no direct contribution to agricultural production, which is handled by \\"peasants or tenants who live at subsistence level\\". Landlord power may be based on control over local people through debt bondage passed down \\"generation after generation\\", and power over the \\"distribution of water, fertilisers, tractor permits and agricultural credit\\", which in turn gives them influence over the \\"revenue, police and judicial administration\\" of local government. In recent times, particularly \\"harsh\\" feudalism has existed in \\"rural Sind\\", Baluchistan, \\"some parts of Southern Punjab\\". Feudal families influence has extended to national affairs through the government bureaucracy, the Armed Forces and the Pakistani political class. Pakistan's \\"major political parties\\" have been called \\"feudal-oriented\\", and as of 2007, \\"more than two-thirds of the National Assembly\\" (Lower House) and most of the key executive posts in the provinces were held by \\"feudals\\", according to scholar Sharif Shuja. Some prominent landed families in Pakistan consist of the Rajputs, Nawabs, Khans, Nawabzadas, Mansabdars, Arbabs, Jatts, Makhdooms, and the Sardars. Explanations for the power of \\"feudal\\" landowning families that has waned in other post-colonial societies such as India and Japan include lack of land reform in Pakistan. Criticism and analysis Critics of feudalism have complained of a \\"culture of feudal impunity\\", where local police will refuse to pursue charges against an influential landowning family even when murder or mayhem have been committed; of abuse of power by some landlords who may place enemies in \\"private prisons\\" and \\"enslave\\" local people through debt bondage; the harming of \\"progress and prosperity\\" by feudals who discourage the education of their \\"subjects\\" for fear it will weaken feudal power; the giving of \\"space\\" to extremists who peasants turn to in the search for deliverance from the cruelty of feudal lords; and an agriculture sector made stagnant by absentee landlordism. Others have complained that Pakistan has developed a \\"fixation\\" on feudalism (Michael Kugelman); that it has become a scapegoat for Pakistan's problems, frequently denounced but not seriously studied (Eqbal Ahmed); a \\"favorite boogie of the urban educated elites\\"; or that it does not exist because South Asia never developed large concentrations of land ownership or a feudal class, and what is called feudal in Pakistan is merely a \\"rural gentry\\", who are \\"junior partners\\" to those who actually hold power (Haider Nizamai). ‚ÄúFeudalism serves as the whipping boy of Pakistan‚Äôs intelligentsia. Yet, to my knowledge few serious studies have been published on the nature and extent of feudal power in Pakistan, and none to my knowledge on the hegemony which feudal culture enjoys in this country.‚Äù Nicolas Martin's work is in this respect an exception, although he argues that it is politically influential landlords, and not all landlords, who wield the despotic and arbitrary powers that are often attributed to the landed classes as a whole. Despite its political influence, feudalism has become so unpopular in public expression and the media that \\"feudal lords\\" are denounced even by some from \\"feudal\\" families (such as Shehbaz Sharif). In media portrayals, the very popular 1975 Pakistan Television (PTV) series Waris centered around a feudal lord (Chaudhry Hashmat) who rules his fiefdom, \\"with an iron grip\\". History In Mughal Empire http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/feudalism-in-pakistan/ \\"It was Akbar not the British colonizers who left us this parasitical curse\\". When the British first set foot on the South Asia, the Mughals were in rule over most part of the region. As a part of their revenue administration was the mansabdari system through which they regulated control over the land revenue of the country. This system, introduced by Mughal Emperor Akbar, remained in place from the late 16th Century (dates vary between 1575 and 1595) till the fall of the Mughal Empire.A Brief History of British Land Acquisition in India Chronology 1757 ‚Äì Battle of Plassey , First battle fought by British East India company which led to the removal of the independent ruler of Bengal- Bihar and placement of a ruler more amicable to the company. 1764 ‚Äì Battle of Buxar , defeat of Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II and his allies, forces him to grant diwani (revenue collection) rights of Bengal and Bihar to the British East India company 1793 ‚Äì Local rule(Nizamat) in Bengal-Bihar abolished and British East India company took over control of governing the region. Cornwallis Code, Permanent Settlement Act introduced. Sending portion of revenue to Mughal Emperor stopped as well. 1761 - 1848 Golden Period of Punjab Under Sikh Rule. Sikh Misles Grip on Muslim Zamindar, A Sikh Jazia was introduced on Muslim zamindars. 1858 ‚Äì British Raj Begins 1887 ‚Äì Punjab Tenancy Act 1887 1901 ‚Äì Land Alienation Act As the chronology above shows, the acquisition of land by the British was a gradual process, dictated by their military conquests over the South Asia. This acquisition of lands ‚Äì and its pattern ‚Äì determined the method of revenue collection that the colonial power opted for, beginning with the diwani, the first time the British gained the right to collect revenue from local land. In due time, with the introduction of the British Raj, they would stamp their legal authority over the South Asia by introducing a number of reforms that would systematically create a new breed of intermediaries in the revenue system. Under colonial rule Difference from Modern Feudalism Often criticized for being the root of our modern feudal system, the mansabdari system was in fact different in many essential ways. First and foremost, the system granted ownership on a non- hereditary transferable basis. The officials, mansabdars, who were granted the job of overseeing of the land, never owned their mansabs but were only granted a share of its earnings as a reward for their work. Thus, since they never owned the land, they did not have the right to pass it on to their offspring, either. This non-ownership of land is the essential difference between modern feudalism and the Mughal mansabdari system. Mansabdars turn into Petty Chiefs However, after the fall of the Mughal Empire, these mansabdars, turned into de facto hereditary landlords and petty chiefs of their mansabs. With the Mughal ruler gone, there was no one to stop them from doing so. But, sadly for them, soon enough, a new force was to gain control of their land ‚Äì the British. In independent Pakistan Almost half of Pakistan's Gross Domestic Product and the bulk of its export earnings are derived from the agricultural sector, which is controlled by a few thousand feudal families. With this concentration of economic power, they also have considerable political power. The leadership of the Pakistan Muslim League, the political party that established Pakistan in 1947, was dominated primarily by feudal landowners such as the Taluqdars, Zamindars, Rajas, Rais, Mahers, Chaudries, Khans, Jagirdars, Nawabs, Nawabzadas and Sardars. The sole exception was the Jinnahs. Through the '50s and the '60s the feudal families retained control over national affairs through the bureaucracy and military. Later on in 1971, they assumed direct power (Ali Bhutto being of a very large landowning family) and retained it until the military regained power. As of 2009, the Prime Minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani , was a major landowner from South Punjab (Multan) and from long- standing political family. The President (Zardari) was a major landowner from Sindh. Shah Mehmood Qureshi also hails as a Feudal Lord from Multan who is also followed as a religious saint. Thus, large landowners have dominated Pakistan's politics since the country's inception.

Arblaster was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the Electoral district of Mosman in 1972 and served until his retirement in 1984. Early life Arblaster was born in Sydney in 1929, the only child of Hugh and Ivy Arblaster, and was educated at Manly Village Public School and then later at Sydney Church of England Grammar School. Upon graduating, he studied accountancy but had a varied career, becoming a salesman for Larke Hoskins Ltd in Sydney, and then a grazier in outback New South Wales and Cunnamulla in South West Queensland. On 17 July 1954, Arblaster married Mary Ann Roberts, and had two daughters, Ann and Fiona. In 1968, Arblaster became a director of Noble Lowndes Australia, and later the managing director of Mitchell's Marina at Church Point. Political career Arblaster joined the Liberal Party in 1956 and held various party positions, including as a member of the State executive and then a country and metropolitan vice-president. He was actively involved in encouraging youth involvement in the Liberal Party and he was the last appointed Liberal Youth Council chairman before the Young Liberals was reconstituted in 1964 as an independent wing of the Liberal Party. During this time, his vice-chairman was future Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. Arblaster contested the 1967 Australian Senate election on the NSW Liberal ticket but was on third position and failed to gain a seat. Arblaster then stood for and was elected to the seat of Mosman at a July 1972 by-election caused by the mid-term retirement of former Liberal Leader and Minister of the Crown, Pat Morton. He went on to be re-elected with a significant majority a further five times. During the Askin and Lewis Government he remained on the backbenches, but following the poor performance of Premier Lewis, despite a federal swing towards the Coalition after the 1975 Federal election, Arblaster, along with fellow backbenchers Neil Pickard (Hornsby) and Keith Doyle (Vaucluse), all of whom had supported Sir Eric Willis in previous ballots, moved against Premier Lewis. At the party room meeting on 20 January 1976, Pickard moved the motion that the leadership be declared vacant. This was carried 22 votes to 11 and Willis was made Leader and Premier unopposed. Willis then appointed Arblaster to the cabinet as Minister for Culture, Sport and Recreation, and Minister for Tourism, being sworn in on 23 January 1976. Minister of the Crown As Minister for Sport, Arblaster was responsible for the introduction of on-the-spot fines, by increasing the power of the trustees, for unruly fans during Sports events at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\\"Spot fines for sports fans\\". Sydney Morning Herald 26 February 1976 pg 2. On 5 April, Arblaster announced the implementation of a 3 million dollar per annum scheme of funding for state sporting organisations and the establishing of a State Sporting Secretariat, to provide administrative assistance to those sporting bodies.\\"$3 million-a-year handout for sport\\". Sydney Morning Herald 6 April 1976 pg 2. He held this post to 14 May 1976 when the Liberal Party lost the 1976 election to the Labor Party under Neville Wran. Thereafter he was appointed as Shadow Minister for Public Works, Ports and Housing under Opposition leader Willis until his resignation on 16 December 1977. Arblaster then announced his intention to contest the vacant leadership against John Maddison, Peter Coleman and Kevin Rozzoli.Kennedy, Peter, \\"Liberals in search for a leader\\". Sydney Morning Herald 14 December 1977 pg 4. However, Coleman eventually emerged successful and Arblaster remained as Shadow Minister for Public Works and Ports from 20 December 1977 to 7 October 1978 when Coleman lost his seat at the 1978 election. Later life When Coleman was formally replaced by John Mason, Arblaster then decided to contest the Deputy Leadership against John Dowd, Rozzoli, Jim Cameron and Bruce McDonald.Kennedy, Peter, \\"John Mason takes charge\\". Sydney Morning Herald 25 October 1978 pg 4. However, McDonald emerged as the new Deputy and Mason then appointed Arblaster as the Shadow Minister for Transport, a position he held from 2 November 1978 to 12 October 1981, lasting through the successive leaderships of Bruce McDonald and John Dowd. During a heated debate in the Legislative Assembly on 8 November 1979 over the Minister for Transport, Peter Cox's decision to reverse the decision to retain Alan Reiher as Commissioner of the Public Transport Commission, Arblaster accused the Government of being influenced by the NSW Labor Council in reaching the decision. After Cox denied this, Arblaster was given several warnings for interjecting before the Speaker, Laurie Kelly, expelled him from the House for 24 hours.Fraill, Rodney, \\"Liberal suspended in heated debate\\". Sydney Morning Herald 9 November 1979 pg 9. From 29 October 1981 to 15 March 1983, Dowd appointed Arblaster as Shadow Minister for Police Services and Shadow Minister for Sport and Recreation, it was to be his last appointment. After Nick Greiner became leader, Arblaster returned to the backbenches until he retired on 5 March 1984.

McColpin (1914‚Äì2003) was a United States Air Force officer who served during World War II, and during the Cold War. Prior to the United States entry into World War II, in November 1940, he volunteered for duty with the Royal Air Force and was commissioned a pilot officer (second lieutenant) in the RAF before transferring to the United States Army Air Forces in the grade of major, at London, England, in September 1942. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, Air Medal with six Oak Leaf Clusters and the British Distinguished Flying Cross. McColpin was credited with 12 kills, 5 probable, and 12 damaged while with the Eagle Squadrons. In both services he could have claimed a minimum of ten more Luftwaffe aircraft of mixed types destroyed on the ground by attacking German airfields in France and Germany. McColpin scored another 8 confirmed kills while in the Army Air Force. Early years Carroll Warren McColpin was born in Buffalo, New York in 1914 and was raised and educated in Los Angeles, California. He participated in civilian flying activities in Los Angeles, and in 1936 obtained his pilot's certificate. As a young man, he had built his own airplane and taught himself the basics of stick flying and aerial acrobatics by the age of sixteen.

Orange Lillies (Royal Academy of Arts Collections).Parsons' biography (British Library). Alfred Parsons was well known for his English landscape paintings and fine botanical illustrations which brought him into contact with William Robinson, for whom he provided illustrations. He regularly exhibited his art work from 1868 to 1919. He also artistically designed significant gardens mostly in England and some in Scotland and the United States. Parsons and his contemporaries believed that an artist could design better gardens. He won the Chantrey Bequest in 1887 and the published his book Notes From Japan in 1896. Parsons became President of the Society of Painters in Watercolours in 1905, and among many other works, he illustrated Ellen Willmott's The Genus Rosa. He was a keen gardener and for the last six years of his life took care of his roses at Luggershill, Broadway, Worcestershire, England. Life and Works When Nature painted all things gay, 1887 (Tate Gallery) Watercolour of Ellen Willmott's garden (private collection) Rosa laxa Alfred Parsons was born in BeckingtonBeckington Parish Register Baptism, Ancestry.co.uk (February 2017) near Frome, Somerset, the son of Dr Joshua Parsons, a surgeon and dedicated gardener of alpines and correspondent of William Robinson,Marion Mako, \\"Painting with nature in Broadway, Worcestershire\\", Journal of the Garden History Society 34.1 (Summer 2006:47-63), p. 47, 49.. and raised in London. After being educated privately, he started work as a clerk in the Post Office in 1867. After two years, he left the unsuitable desk-job to pursue studies at the Kensington School of Art, and went on to exhibit at various galleries including the Grosvenor Gallery and the Royal Academy, where he exhibited every year from 1874 to the end of his life.Mako 2006:48. Parsons, whose interest in \\"Englishness\\"Mako 2006: \\"The Cult of Englishness\\" pp48ff. paralleled the tastes of upper-class American √©migr√©s, joined the notable artistic community in the village of Broadway in the Cotswolds (Worcestershire).Broadway (Worcestershire); Marion Mako, \\"Painting with nature in Broadway, Worcestershire\\", Journal of the Garden History Society 34.1 (Summer 2006:47-63), examines painterly effects in some gardens designed by Parsons for friends in the Broadway circle. His associates included the American artists Francis Davis Millet, who remained Parson's closest friend until he drowned aboard the Titanic, and Edwin Austin Abbey, with whom he collaborated in illustrated books. Through American contacts made while at the artists' colony he became an illustrator for Harper's Magazine,Harper's Magazine and also provided illustrations for books ‚Äì including short stories by Thomas HardyIllustrated Thomas Hardy (Victorian Web). and travel books (see below). Henry James noted that Parson's images of English country life mirrored the aspirations of Americans: > Was it thereIn America. that Mr. Parsons learned so well how Americans would > like England to appear? ...The England of his pencil... is exactly the > England that the American imagination, restricted to itself, constructs from > the poets, the novelists, from all the delightful testimony it > inherits\\".James, \\"Our artists in Europe\\", Harper's Magazine, 79 (June 1889), > quoted in Mako 2006:49. The three men, Parsons, Millet and Abbey, lived together and entertained sociably at 54, Bedford Gardens, London.Parsons gave it up in 1914 (Mako 2006:59). William Robinson asked him to provide illustrations for The Wild Garden: Or, Our Groves and Shrubberies Made Beautiful by the Naturalisation of Hardy Exotic Plants (1881, the 1903-5th edition being the best one) led to Robinson's invitation for Parsons to lend advice at his Gravetye Manor. Several artists engraved Parsons' illustrations. As it was the custom, he never engraved himself. Parsons' first garden commission, however, came through the architect Philip Webb, who was designing Clouds in Wiltshire for Mr and Mrs Percy Wyndham, prominent figures among the aesthetic-minded group called \\"The Souls\\": Parsons provided an unostentatious planting of spring bulbs, Magnolia √ó soulangeana, roses and lilies, in a framework of clipped yews, wedding new and old elements.Mako 2006:52. Parsons' long-lasting association with the Anglo-American group centred in Broadway, began in 1885, when Parsons and his London friends rented a house facing the Green, where John Singer Sargent began painting Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose. Parsons first made a garden for himself and his friends at Russell House facing the Evesham road at the western entrance to Broadway, then a garden setting for Mary Anderson, Mrs Antonio de Navarro at Court Farm (1896 onwards) and later for himself, at Luggershill (1903 onwards). Parsons' fine illustrated book, his only published text, Notes in Japan (London, 1895, reprinted) came from his visit to that country between 1892 and 1894. Ellen Willmott's The Genus Rosa, published in two volumes between 1910 and 1914, includes 132 watercolours of roses painted by Parsons between 1890 and 1908, which are now held by the Lindley Library in London. Willmott also commissioned Parsons to paint her three gardens. As a designer of gardens, Parsons went into partnership in 1898 with Captain Walter Croker St-Ives Partridge (1855‚Äî1924), as Parsons and Partridge of Newbury, Berkshire. In 1884 they took into the partnership Charles Clement Tudway (1846‚Äî1926).Nicole Milette, Parsons, Partridge, Tudway: an unsuspected garden design partnership, 1884-1914 (York : Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, University of York) 1995. Parson's restorations of old gardens and designs of sympathetic settings for old houses can be appreciated at 15th-century Great Chalfield Manor and at Elizabethan Littlecote House, both in Wiltshire. Alfred Parsons and Walter Partridge also worked on the gardens at Welbeck Abbey, 1899‚Äî1905 and at Bryngarw, Glamorganshire. An early essay was Wightwick Manor, a reproduction black-and- white house, for which Parsons provided the garden in 1887. He was elected Associate Member of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1897 and Royal Academician (RA) in 1911.Royal Academy of Arts Collections; Alfred Parsons, R.A.

It led to the establishment of the Securities and Investments Board, the forerunner to the Financial Services Authority. Background Throughout the greater part of the 20th century the UK financial services industry was largely self- regulated in its nature. The main regulatory legislation was the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 which was introduced in an attempt to provide a degree of consumer protection, but in itself did not go far enough as the scope was narrow and was frequently open to interpretation. A number of factors, both positive and negative, forced the government to reconsider the way financial services were regulated in the UK. These included a number of highly publicised scandals to hit the UK financial services sector in the '70s and '80s involving mis-selling of personal pension schemes, endowments and split capital investment trusts. In response to these factors the Government appointed the Wilson Committee in 1980 to review the financial system. The Government, unsatisfied with their findings, recruited Professor Laurence Gower in 1981 to consider new legislation.Research Paper 99/68, UK Parliament, 24 June 1999: Financial Services and Markets Bill His mandate was as follows:- *The level of statutory investor protection *how investment advice and management advice are controlled *whether law changes should be made to improve consumer protection *the relevant developments of the EEC (European Economic Community) Gower produced his report and the Government adopted a number of his proposals in a white paper (Jan 1985). The Financial Services Act 1986 (FSAct) followed the white paper, receiving royal assent in November 1986. Its scope centered on Investment business and activities carried out in relation to those investments. In line with the proposals given by Gower, The FSAct named the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) as the designated agency for the supervision of investment business within the UK (the forerunner to the Financial Services Authority FSA). The SIB created five Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs), later condensed to three: *The Personal Investment Authority *The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation *the Securities and Futures Authority These were all later subsumed into the FSA. In addition the SIB also recognised other bodies that conducted day-to-day regulation of investment business:- *Recognised professional bodies (RPBs) (nine in total including the Law Society) *Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) *Recognised Clearing Houses (RCHs) References *Swift, Hollie.

The pump produced a constant pressure to force the measured liquid through the capillary. The viscosity was then determined by taking pressure readings a certain points off the capillary. The value of viscosity was then transferred to a PID controller to regulate the temperature of the fuel. This device allowed to measure the real time changes of viscosity and was heavily used in the maritime industry to optimize the combustion of the fuel oil in diesel engines.

The purpose of this is commonly to monitor and study levels of pollutants in the atmosphere, rivers and other specific settings. Other environmental analysis techniques include biological surveys or biosurvey, soil analysis or soil test, vegetation surveys and tree identification, and remote sensing which uses satellite imagery to assess the environment on different spatial scales.  Analysis techniques  Chemical analysis typically involves sampling some part of the environment and using lab equipment to figure out how much of a certain target compound exists. Someone might use chemical analysis to assess pollution levels for remediation, or to make sure groundwater is safe for drinking. Biological surveys typically include a measurement of the abundance of a certain species within a certain area to ascertain information about the ecosystem for specific reasons. Analysis like this could be used in efforts to understand species abundance, or to look at how external effects from the environment are affecting an ecosystem. RAXWORTHY, C. J., PEARSON, R.

Soil samples might be needed if someone is determining whether they can build on a certain site, or just to produce a model of an area.Ojeda, M. B., Quintanilla Dom√≠nguez, J., Ruelas, R., Mart√≠n, S. J. J., & Tarquis, A. M. (2019). Pore detection in 3‚ÄêD CT soil samples through an improved sub‚Äêsegmentation method. European Journal of Soil Science, 70(1), 66‚Äì82. A vegetation survey is quite similar to a biosurvey because one is measuring the abundance of plant species and trees within a specific area to understand more about the ecosystem for specific reasons. Sometimes these are done to understand ecological effects from outside factors, or to just determine overall ecosystem health.March-Salas, M., Moreno-Moya, M., Palomar, G., Tejero-Ibarra, P., Haeuser, E., & Pertierra, L. R. (n.d.). An innovative vegetation survey design in Mediterranean cliffs shows evidence of higher tolerance of specialized rock plants to rock climbing activity. APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE, 21(2), 289‚Äì297. Remote sensing can be used for environmental analysis by taking imagery shot by satellites in multiple wavelengths to assess areas of different scale for a certain objective. Remote sensing can be used to identify land use, it can be used to determine damages from forest fires, it can be used for weather systems and meteorology, and also for atmospheric composition.Alvarez-Mendoza, C. I., Teodoro, A., & Ramirez-Cando, L. (2019). Spatial estimation of surface ozone concentrations in Quito Ecuador with remote sensing data, air pollution measurements and meteorological variables. Environmental Monitoring And Assessment, 191(3), 155. .

Rise to elite Hovinen exploded to international attention in the mid-70s and was ranked #1 in the world by Track & Field News in 1975. Resultwise though, his best year by far was 1976, which saw him winning his first Finnish championship and throwing 90 meters or more in seemingly every competition, culminating in his personal best of 93.54 thrown in Helsinki on June 23, 1976. This was very close to the world record, held at the time at 94.08 by Klaus Wolfermann. Hovinen entered the 1976 Summer Olympics as a leading favorite, together with Mikl√≥s N√©meth of Hungary. 1976 Summer Olympics Hovinen cleared the qualification easily, throwing 89.76 with his first throw. Though Finland has produced no less than seven Olympic gold medalists in the javelin (including Julius Saaristo's gold in the 1912 two hands competition), this still remains the longest throw ever by a Finn at an Olympics. It was also the longest of the qualification, narrowly ahead of N√©meth. Next day in the final however, N√©meth opened with a new world record of 94.58. Hovinen found himself completely unable to respond, and finished a very disappointing seventh with a lackluster mark of 84.26. 1977 doping positive and further career After winning another Finnish championship in 1977, Hovinen tested positive for anabolic steroids (together with fellow Finns Markku Tuokko and Asko Pesonen) at the 1977 European Cup in Helsinki. He was initially given a lifetime ban by IAAF, but this was reduced on an appeal by the Finnish Athletics Association (SUL) and Hovinen became eligible to compete again on August 13, 1978, just in time to take part in the 1978 European Athletics Championships. He cleared the qualification with his first throw but failed again in the final, taking the middle spot as team Finland swept the last three places. Hovinen never returned to his 1976 shape, though he won one more Finnish championship in 1981. He is married to Ulla Lundholm, the Finnish record holder in women's discus throw; they are the parents of Niko Hovinen.

She originally raced on dirt, with limited success. Switched to turf at age four, she won seven of eight starts and was named the American Champion Female Turf Horse. Background Soaring Softly was bred and raced by Joan Phillips and her son John of the renowned Darby Dan Farm. Her sire is Darby Dan's outstanding stallion Kris S., a son of the Darby Dan European star grass racer Roberto. Her dam is the farm's own mare Wings of Grace, who was a daughter of the 1972 American Champion 3-Year-Old Colt, Key to the Mint. Wings of Grace is from the family of Softly, one of Darby Dan's most influential broodmares. Racing career At age two Soaring Softly was conditioned for racing by Jimmy Toner. She made her racing debut at age two on October 18, 1997, with a third-place finish in a seven-furlong event for maidens on the dirt track at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. She won her second and final start of the year in a one-mile event for maidens at Aqueduct Racetrack on November 11. At age three Soaring Softly made six starts at age three, winning her first outing on April 24, 1998, at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky. She then returned to Belmont Park for the June 7 Grade 1 Acorn Stakes, in which she finished fourth behind winner Jersey Girl. She then finished sixth in the June 27 Mother Goose Stakes, again won by Jersey Girl. Soaring Softly did not start again until November, when she returned to competing in allowance races at Aqueduct Racetrack, earning two third-place finishes in mile events. In her final start of 1998, on December 5, Soaring Softly ran second in a mile and a sixteenth allowance race. At age four, a Champion on turf Wintered in Florida, after she won just one minor race in six starts on dirt in 1998, Soaring Softly's handlers made the decision to test her on the turf course at Gulfstream Park. The result was instant success that ended with a Championship year. Soaring Softly won her first five starts of the year, including the Sheepshead Bay Handicap and New York Handicap, before finishing fifth in the Diana Handicap at Saratoga Race Course in early September. Then, under new jockey Jerry Bailey, she won the Grade 1 Flower Bowl Invitational Handicap at Belmont Park, notably defeating runnerup Coretta. She capped off the year with her seventh win in eight starts, gaining a second straight victory over Coretta in the mile and three-eighths Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf, hosted that year by Gulfstream Park. She was voted the 1999 American Champion Female Turf Horse. After developing a tissue strain that would have required therapy and a lengthy recovery, Soaring Softly was retired from racing. Retirement As a broodmare, Soaring Softly was bred to top class stallions such as Storm Cat, Gone West, Seeking The Gold and Distorted Humor. She produced seven foals between 2001 and 2008, one of which have met with much success in racing. After failing to deliver a live foal for the next several years, she underwent a Caesarian section in 2013. The resulting foal, named Manitoulin, was raised by a nurse mare and went on to become a graded stakes winner. Soaring Softly died in a paddock accident in September, 2015, at the age of 20. The Soaring Softly Stakes at Gulfstream Park is named in her honor.

On the local level, the course has always been known for its challenging nature and slower than average times, but recent national media attention sealed the course's status as one of the most challenging cross country courses in the nation. History The Hereford High School Cross site was originally designed as a two-mile-long championship cross country course in 1957.

The book is divided into four parts, telling a continuous story but each section told in a different voice and by several different authors. Plot summary The first section, titled \\"Spring\\" and told in first person, chronicles the entanglement of Columbia University student Adam Walker with French political science professor Rudolf Born, who meet in New York City in the spring of 1967 and who form an alliance to publish a literary magazine. Their friendship splinters as a result of a tense love triangle with Born's girlfriend Margot and as a result of a late night mugging that ends in violence. The second section, \\"Summer\\" describes the events in Adam's life later that summer in New York sharing an apartment with his older sister, Gwyn. This section of the story is told in second person. Adam's story of the summer of 1967 is also framed by his having sent his manuscript, written in 2007, to a new character, Jim, who we are told is a famous author. In the framing story, Jim tells us how he receives the manuscript from a dying Adam and they arrange to meet. In the third section, \\"Fall\\" we learn that Adam, in 2007, has died before he and James could meet, and has completed only notes of the third and final section of his memoir of 1967. James fleshes out the notes Adam has left in a third person account. \\"Fall\\" tells the story of Adam's trip to Paris, where he encounters Born and Margot, as well as other friends of Born's, a woman named H√©l√®ne and her daughter C√©cile. Adam inserts himself into the lives of these women and contrives a scheme to atone for guilt he carries stemming from his actions following the mugging in New York. The final section takes place in 2007. James has been told by Gwyn that the major events of the second section of the book are entirely made-up, and James wonders whether any of the purported memoir is true. In searching for corroboration, James tracks down C√©cile, now a distinguished literary scholar. She concludes the story by describing in her diary how she, in 2007, has a final strange contact with Rudolf Born, at his remote island home in the Caribbean. Themes The book centers on the tension between sex and war in the hearts of 1960s radicals, and the magnetism of intelligence and evil. As with much of Auster's work the novel deals with questions of shifting identity, puzzles and illusion, a persistent sense of dread, and of characters feeling trapped by circumstances over which they have no control.

History View of the Kerjalon Hostel with the hotel to the left A hotel of the same name existed at least before 1968, when it was used for local conferences and meetings by the Viking Congress. The current hotel was established in May 1983 as Hotel F√∏royar, later named Hotel Borg, when shipowner J√°kup Joensen (also called J√°kup √≠ Lopra) bought the hotel. The distinct building, a flat construction with a traditional grass roof and 216 beds, was designed by architects Friis & Moltke from Denmark. In 1991, the shipping company Smyril Line purchased the hotel and changed its name back to Hotel F√∏royar. However the hotel was sold to a group of the hotel's staff in 2005, it was sold for the benefit of refinancing the modern ferry line Norr√∂na.

The club is a member of the South West Rugby League, playing home matches at Horsham Fields, Plymouth.  History  History of rugby league in the South West The first attempt at forming a club was in the Northern Union days of 1912 when in a dispute over inducements to players, attempts were made to form a Western League of clubs in Devon and Cornwall. Huddersfield beat Oldham 31‚Äì26 in an exhibition game at South Devon Place (the home of Plymouth RFC) before 8000 spectators and as a result a meeting was held and the Plymouth Northern Union Club formed. In July, the Northern Union club took over South Devon Place and as a result the ailing Plymouth RFC disbanded, later to re-emerge as part of a merger with Devonport Albion to become Plymouth Albion. At Christmas, Coventry Northern Union beat Plymouth twice before a number of games were played against local opposition in the new year including Newton Abbot, Teignmouth, Torquay and Paignton (plus a 27‚Äì17 defeat at the hands of St. Helens at their home ground South Devon Place (now Astor Field) on Embankment Road. An international was staged at South Devon Place with a crowd of 7000 witnessing England's victory over Wales 40‚Äì16 on 15 February 1913 (a Wales and West side had beaten England 27‚Äì25 at Home Park on 10 September 1910 following the return of the Northern Union tourists from Australasia) and Devon clubs hosted a touring Northern Union Combination which Plymouth thrashed 33‚Äì3 but the club along with the league folded during the summer of 1913 due to Plymouth losing the lease at South Devon Place (which was bought by the Astor family and given to the people of Plymouth as Astor Field) and Torquay were refused permission to share the Recreation Ground with Torquay Athletic RFC. The majority of players returned to union though some moved north to continue their 13-a-side careers with Willie Davies and Dave Holland representing the Northern Union (now Great Britain) on the 1914 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Another well-known figure from that era was James Peters who was the first black player to represent England at rugby union before playing league for Plymouth and then moving on to play for Barrow. Peters was recently the subject of an exhibition at Twickenham. No rugby league was played in the area for another forty-four years until Leigh and Barrow toured Devon in 1947 and later Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers played three games in Cornwall during the summer of 1962. In 1985, following the formation of the Cheltenham club the previous year, another club was formed in Plymouth following an inquiry by Lionel Hurst, the instigator of what as to become the Midlands and South West Amateur Rugby League Association (MASWARLA). The first game was played at Pittville Park, Cheltenham on Sunday 12 May 1985. Plymouth trailed 22‚Äì2 at half time but rallied to win 30‚Äì26 and enough interest was shown to enter the MASWARLA League for the 1985/6 season. The club remained in the league until 1992 as first Plymouth-Tamarside and latterly Plymouth City. Problems with teams travelling down for games and the final disbanding of the MASWARLA League left the club out on a limb and the club disbanded due to lack of fixtures. The following year, plans were made for a local competition, and in December 1993 a four-team league began with West Park Warriors, Stonehouse Saints, Devonport Pirates and the St. Budeaux Bulldogs competing for the Plymouth and District League, eventually won by Stonehouse, and the League played hosts to Wigan St. Judes and Wigan Tech at the end of the season. However, the momentum was lost the following season and the league collapsed. Plymouth RLFC Apart from a couple of visits by Wigan St. Judes playing against scratch sides at the end of the rugby union season there was little activity in the area until a group of friends advertised on the RLFans.com website in 2001 aiming to form a club to join the Rugby League Conference. The Plymouth Rock RLFC never really caught on and after failing to attract sponsorship and players the club failed. However a number of the group along with Ray Pickavance from St Helens revived the idea in 2003. After a flurry of emails and telephone conversations the club had its first meeting at the Fortescue pub on Mutley Plain. Numbers grew and the club ‚Äì now based at the new Stonehouse Creek Leisure and Social Club on Stonehouse Creek ‚Äì played its first games at the Bristol and West 9s on 16 May 2004. Despite losing three of their games and drawing the other the club had given a taste of the game to a number of new players and the first full 13-a-side game was played away to Blandford Bulldogs in Dorset on 3 July 2004 with a return game on the Creek on 15 August. Despite losing both games interest was maintained and the club successfully applied for membership of the Rugby League Conference in January 2005. Despite early setbacks and a number of changes in personnel, the club completed a relatively successful year with a nailbiting defeat to St Ives Roosters in the semi-final of the RLC Shield 34‚Äì32 at Hemel Hempstead after finishing fourth of five in the South West Division. 2006 saw Plymouth finish third in the South West and West Midlands division before losing narrowly to Burntwood Barbarians in the play-offs. Plymouth Titans For 2007, a new South West Division of the Rugby League Conference was created with new clubs in East Devon Eagles (Exmouth), Devon Sharks (Newton Abbot) and Exeter Centurions joining Plymouth (who added the suffix \\"Titans\\") and Somerset Vikings \\"A\\". The season started with the South West Nines at Taunton which the Titans won ‚Äì beating the East Devon Eagles 8‚Äì6 in the final. The club was forced to leave their home ground of Stonehouse Creek after playing their opening two games due to proposed re-surfacing of the pitches and transferred to King George V Playing Fields at Elburton for the remainder of the season. 2007 was Plymouth's most successful yet with nine wins out of ten in the league, a 96‚Äì0 win in the South West Grand Final against Devon Sharks and only narrowly losing to Bedford Tigers in the RLC semi-final at Bristol. The Titans suffered just three defeats, the semi-final reverse to Bedford and two defeats at the hands of the East Devon Eagles who won a Friday night thriller at the KGV 37‚Äì36 and 40‚Äì34 in the Devon Cup Final at Exmouth. In addition, a second team ‚Äì the Stonehouse Stallions ‚Äì was formed and played in the Devon Cup, losing all four games. In 2008, the Titans gained revenge for their previous final loss beating Eagles 31‚Äì20 in the Devon Cup Final. In 2008, Plymouth Titans beat Devon Sharks 42‚Äì22 at Plymouth Albion‚Äôs Brickfields home. Plymouth Titans failed to complete the 2009 season in the South West division.

It is designed to assist judges, registrars of the Family Court of Australia, mediators and lawyers. Split Up operates as a hybrid system, combining rule ‚Äì based reasoning with neural network theory.Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J., Split_Up: The use of an argument based knowledge representation to meet expectations of different users for discretionary decision making,p.1 Research has shown that rule-based reasoning on its own is not ideal in discretionary fields of law. Rule based reasoning operates within strict parameters, in the form: IF < condition(s) > then .Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J., Split Up: An Intelligent Decision Support System Which Provides Advice Upon Property Division Following Divorce, International Journal of Law and Information Technology, Vol 6. No. 2, 1998, 190‚Äì213. Neural networks, by contrast, are considered to be better suited to generate decisions in uncertain domains, since they can be taught to weigh the factors considered by judicial decision makers from case data. Yet, they do not provide an explanation for the conclusions they reach. Split_up, with a view to overcome this flaw, uses argument structures proposed by Toulmin as the basis for representations from which explanations can be generated.Stranieri,A. and Zeleznikow, J. (1995) The split-up system: integrating neural networks and rule-based reasoning in the legal domain. Application In Australian family law, a judge in determining the distribution of property will: #identify the assets of the marriage included in the common pool #establish what percentage of the common pool each party will receive #determine a final property order in line with the decisions made in 1. and 2. Split_Up implements step 1 and 2 : the common pool determination and the prediction of a percentage split. The common pool determination Since the determination of marital property is rule based, it is implemented using directed graphs.Nolan, J.R. and Zeleznikow, J., Using soft computing to build real world intelligent decision support systems in uncertain domains, Decision Support Systems, 31 (2001) 263‚Äì285. However, the percentage split between the parties is discretionary in that a judge has a wide discretion to look at each party's contributions to the marriage under section 79(4) of the Family Law Act 1975. Broadly, the contributions can be taken as financial or non-financial. The party who can demonstrate a larger contribution to the marital relationship will receive a larger proportion of the assets. The court may further look at each party's financial resources and future needs under section 75(2)of the Family Law Act 1975. These needs can include factors such as the inability to gain employment, the continued care of a child under 18 years of age or medical expenses. This means that different judges may and will reach different conclusions based on the same facts, since each judge assigns different relevant weights to each factor. Split_up determines the percentage split by using a combination of rule- based reasoning and neural networks. The percentage split determination In order to determine how judges weigh the different factors, 103 written judgements of commonplace cases were used to establish a database comprising 94 relevant factors for percentage split determination. The factors relevant for a percentage split determination are: -Past contributions of a husband relative to those of a wife -The husband‚Äôs future needs relative to those of the wife -The wealth of the marriage The factors relevant for a determination of past contributions are -The relative direct and indirect contributions of both parties -The length of the marriage -The relative contributions of both parties to the homemaking role. The hierarchy provides a structure that is used to decompose the task of predicting an outcome into 35 subtasks. Outputs of tasks further down the hierarchy are used as inputs into sub-tasks higher up the hierarchy. Each sub-task is treated as a separate and smaller data mining exercise. Twenty one solid arcs represent inferences performed with the use of rule sets. For example, the level of wealth of a marriage is determined by a rule, which uses the common pool value. By contrast, the fourteen dashed arcs establish inferences performed with the use of neural networks. These receive their name from the fact that they resemble a nervous system in the brain. They consist of many self ‚Äì adjusting processing elements cooperating in a densely interconnected network. Each processing element generates a single output that is transmitted to the other processing element. The output signal of a processing element depends on the input to the processing element, i.e. each input is gated by a weighing factor that determines the amount of influence that the input will have on the output. The strength of the weighing factors is adjusted autonomously by the processing element as the data is processed. In Split_Up, the neural network is a statistical technique for learning the weights of each of the relevant attributes used in a percentage split determination of marital property. Hence the inputs to the neural network are contributions, future needs and wealth, and the output the percentage split predicted. On each arc there is a statistical weight. Using back propagation the neural network learns the necessary pattern to recognize the prediction. It is trained by repeatedly exposing it to examples of the problem and learning the significance (weights) of the input nodes. The neural network used by Split_up is said to generalise well if the output of the network is correct (or nearly correct) for examples not seen during training, which classifies it as an intelligent system. Toulmin Argument Structure Since the manner in which these weights are learned is primarily statistical, domain knowledge of legal rules and principles is not modelled directly. However, explanations for a legal conclusion in a domain as discretionary as the determining the distribution of property following divorce, are at least as important as the conclusion reached. Hence the creators of Split_Up used Toulmin Argument structures, to provide independent explanations of the conclusions reached. These operate on the basis that every argument makes an assertion based on some data. The assertion of the argument stands as the claim of the argument. Since knowing the data and the claim, does not necessarily mean that the claim follows from the data, a mechanism is required to justify the claim in the light of the data. The justification is known as the warrant. The backing of an argument supports the validity of the warrant. In the legal domain, this is typically a reference to a statute or a precedent. Here, a neural network (or rules), produce a conclusion from the data of an argument and the data, warrant and backing are reproduced to generate an explanation. It is noteworthy, though, that an argument‚Äôs warrant is reproduced as an explanation regardless of the claim values used. This lack of claim - sensitivity must be overcome by the different users, i.e.the judge, the representatives for the wife and the representatives for the husband, each of whom is encouraged to use the system to prepare their cases, but not to rely exclusively on its outcome.

He was educated at Eton and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1865 with first-class honours in Law. He was also awarded an LL.B. (1865) and an M.A. (1868). He was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn. In the course of his legal career he was appointed King's Counsel.Truth, volume 57, 1905, pg 1510 Willis-Bund was Professor of Constitutional Law and History at King's College London from 1869 to 1882, and Lecturer in Law at the University of Bristol from 1877 to 1879. Robert Thomas Jenkins noted that Willis-Bund wrote extensively about the history of the church in Wales but that some of his views were not generally held to be those of other academics writing in the field. Jenkins commented on his editing of the Black Book of St. Davids in 1902 for the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion: '...the work was but indifferently done', and mentioned another of Willis-Bund's books, The Celtic Church of Wales, 1897, which propounded a theory of his own and was, Jenkins states, judged by Louis Gougaud to be \\"dubious and prejudiced,\\" and by Sir J. E. Lloyd to be \\"very haphazard\\".Biograph on Louis Gougaud Additionally, Gougaud observed that Willis-Bund's views (along with those of Rice Rees), were 'widely different' from 'those adopted by present-day historians on the relation of ancient Celtic Christianity to the See of Peter',The Month, vol. 169, p. 158 and Lloyd further stated that the work was a 'book of original, but highly disputable, views.'J. E. Lloyd and the Creation of Welsh History: Renewing a Nation's Past, Huw Pryce, University of Wales Press, 2011, end-note 57 The Church Quarterly Review, in summary at the end of its review of the volume, concluded: 'We have not refrained from pointing out what we think the weak points of Mr Willis Bund's book: but the book is far better than its weakest points'. The book was considered a 'detailed' 'study of the institutions of ancient Welsh Christianity'.Church Quarterly Review, vol. 45, 1898, p. 151 Willis-Bund was referred to by the Welsh politician Clement Edwards in a 1914 House of Commons debate on the Established Church in Wales as 'a great authority... one of the greatest authorities on the history of the old Welsh Church'. Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen, however, in response, observed that Willis-Bund 'never got any support for the theory' in question, regarding the origins of tithing.https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1914-04-20/debates/40d7a68c-a73f-46ee- aa9b-0392ffeee796/EstablishedChurch(Wales)Bill He served as chairman of the Worcestershire County Council, the Worcestershire Appeal Tribunal, and the Worcestershire National Relief Fund during the First World War.

Temple's eldest son, also named Richard, became the first baronet Temple of the Nash. The Willis-Bunds had six children.

(On the way Peruvian had had to make a detour to Guernsey to pick up a supply of French wine for Napoleon.) Cockburn was concerned that the French might use Ascension Island, uninhabited at the time, to stage a rescue mission. He therefore decided to claim and garrison the island. On 22 October 1815, at 5pm, Peruvian and Zenobia anchored in Clarence Bay. The ships' logs record that at 5.30pm, White and Dobree came ashore, raised the Jack, and took possession of the island in the name of His Britannic Majesty, King George III. Zenobia left shortly thereafter but Peruvian stayed until spring.Watson (1912), p.245. Napoleon died on St Helena in 1821 and the Admiralty wanted to withdraw the garrison. However, Sir George Collier, Commodore of the West Africa Squadron, persuaded the Admiralty to retain it as it had become a victualling station for the vessels of the squadron, which was engaged in anti-slavery patrols. It also provided a sanatorium for the squadron's ships and crew. Ascension Island was later designated \\"HMS Ascension\\", a \\"Stone sloop of War of the smaller class\\". Fate By July 1816 Peruvian was laid up in ordinary at Plymouth where she stayed until 1830. She was broken up on 25 February 1830. Citations and references Citations References * Colledge, J.J.

The theatre is known for varied entertainment, ranging from comedy to musical shows. From 1967 to 2003 it was called the ABC theatre. Since 2016, it has been known as Edderkoppen Scene. History The theatre premiered on 3 September 1942 at a different venue. It turned out that the theater auditorium was too small, and in 1945 moved to St. Olav's place. Einar Schanke (1927‚Äì1992) took over as theatre director and theatrical producer in 1967, and the theater changed its name to the ABC theater. The theater, however, retained its traditions under Schanke's management. In 1992 Schanke died, and Tom Sterri, Ketil Aamodt and Anders Moland took over. In 1999 the theatre was destroyed by a powerful explosion. A real estate company that owned a nearby hotel purchased the property. The company committed itself at the same time to rebuild the theatre. In autumn 2003, reconstruction had finished, and the theatre was returned to its original name, Edderkoppen. In December 2014, ownership transfers operations to Scandic Hotels and after extensive renovation, opened the stage in May 2016 with a new name; Edderkoppen Scene.

Krishnan works in the areas of anti-human trafficking and social policy. Her organization, Prajwala shelters rescued women and children and set up one of the largest rehabilitation homes in the country. She is making it possible for NGOs organizations to manage jointly a range of protective and rehabilitative services for women and children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. She was awarded India's fourth highest civilian award the Padma Shri in 2016. Early life Krishnan was born in Bangalore, to Palakkad Malayali parents Raju Krishnan and Nalini Krishnan. She saw most of the country early on while traveling from one place to another with her father, who worked with the Department of Survey which makes maps for the entire country. Krishnan's passion for social work became manifested when, at the age of eight years, she started teaching dance to mentally challenged children. By the age of twelve, she was running schools in slums for underprivileged children. At the age of fifteen, while working on a neo-literacy campaign for the Dalit community, Krishnan was gang raped by eight men. They did not like that a woman was interfering with what they claimed as ‚Äúman‚Äôs society.‚Äù They beat her so badly that she is partially deaf in one ear. This incident served as the impetus for what she does today. Krishnan studied in Central Government Schools in Bangalore and Bhutan. After obtaining a bachelor's degree in environmental sciences from St. Joseph's College in Bangalore, Krishnan completed her MSW (medical & psychiatric) from Roshni Nilaya, Mangalore. Career Krishnan decided to move to Hyderabad, to join PIN as the Coordinator for the program for young women. Krishnan soon became involved with the housing problems of slum dwellers. When the homes of people living by the city's Musi River were slated to be bulldozed for a \\"beautification\\" project, she joined the housing rights campaign of PIN, organized protests and stalled the scheme.It was in Hyderabad that she met Brother Jose Vetticatil, who was then Director of Boys‚Äô Town, a Catholic Institution run by the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel, that rehabilitated and trained young people at risk by providing them vocational skills that fetched them handsome jobs in India and abroad This was in 1996. Prajwala In 1996, sex workers living in Mehboob ki Mehandi, a red light area in Hyderabad, were evacuated. As a result, thousands of women, who were caught in the clutches of prostitution, were left homeless. Having found a like-minded person in Brother Jose Vetticatil, a missionary, Krishnan started a transition school at the vacated brothel to prevent the second generation from being trafficked. In its early years, Krishnan had to sell her jewelry and even most of her household utensils to make ends meet at Prajwala. Today, Prajwala stands upon five pillars: prevention, rescue, rehabilitation, reintegration and advocacy. The organization extends moral, financial, legal and social support to victims and ensures that perpetrators are brought to justice. To date, Prajwala has rescued, rehabilitated, or served over 12,000 survivors of sex trafficking, and the scale of their operations makes them the largest anti-trafficking shelter in the world. > The warehouse of energy and optimism that she is, Ms. Krishnan's enthusiasm > easily rubs off on those around her as well. As a former co-worker, says, > \\"Working with Sunitha is like a constant learning experience, with her > constantly throwing challenges, urging staff to tap their potential. She not > only monitors but also mentors her staff in all spheres of work and life. > Her undying hope, passion, relentless struggle to reach goals set for > herself and for Prajwala (actually synonymous) inspires the team to stay > focused on the cause too.\\" The organization's \\"second-generation\\" prevention program operates in 17 transition centers and has helped prevent thousands of children of prostituted mothers from entering the flesh trade. Prajwala also operates a shelter home for rescued children and adult victims of sex trafficking, many of whom are HIV positive. Krishnan not only leads these interventions, but has also spearheaded an economic rehabilitation program which trains survivors in carpentry, welding, printing, masonry and housekeeping. Prajwala has over 200 employees, but Krishnan runs the organization as a full-time volunteer‚Äîa decision she took very early in her life. She supports herself, with help from her husband, by writing books and giving speeches and seminars on trafficking worldwide. She is married to Mr. Rajesh Touchriver, an Indian filmmaker, art director and scriptwriter, who has made several films in collaboration with Prajwala. One of the films, Anamika, is now a part of the curricula of the National Police Academy, while another Naa Bangaaru Talli won 3 National Awards in 2014. Social policy In 2003, Krishnan drafted recommendations for rehabilitation of victims of sex trafficking in Andhra Pradesh, which were passed by the State Government as a Policy for Rescue & Rehabilitation of Victims of Trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation vide GO MS 1. Ms. Krishnan was appointed as advisor for the Government of Kerala's Nirbhaya policy for Women and Children to fight sexual violence and trafficking in 2011. The scheme, which was originally drafted by Krishnan, is coordinated by various government departments like social welfare, SC/ST, police, health, labor and local self-government in collaboration with NGOs. However, she resigned from this advisory position on 4 August 2014, expressing anguish and frustration at the lack of political will to implement the Nirbhaya policy. In March 2015, in a \\"move of repentance\\" the government re-inducted Sunitha Krishnan back to its Nirbhaya scheme by giving her more decision-making power through the role of Honorary Director. In the United States, Ms. Krishnan has met auditoriums full of students in order to raise awareness, warn them against getting involved in the industry and inspire new activism. Not only did she spearhead the first ever Statewide Campaign against Sex Trafficking targeting adolescent girls in collaboration with the State government and various international funding agencies, but she also launched the Men Against Demand campaign with the slogan \\"Real Men Don‚Äôt Buy Sex\\" which has reached 1.8 billion people worldwide. She was also appointed as a member of the Andhra Pradesh State Women's Commission and contributed to India's new Bill on Rape, which was passed in Parliament in 2013 to increase punitive measures for sexual violence and assault. Legal advocacy With personal experience in many raids, Krishnan has realized that without a meaningful state policy, no amount of social work or activism at the micro-level is enough to be helpful. She therefore goes about her task forging partnerships with various police departments, especially Women Protection Cell, the Anti Human Trafficking Unit. Krishnan started the first ever Crises Counseling Centre in Afzalgunj Police Station‚Äìa pilot project for Police-NGO collaboration to intercept sex trafficking. She has persuaded the Andhra Pradesh government to work with her in cracking down on this organized crime and helped secure the conviction of more than 150 traffickers. Krishnan has also conducted sensitization workshops for thousands of senior police officers, judges, prosecutors and Child Welfare Committee members to equip them with the requisite understanding and skills to effectively handle cases of human trafficking and advocate for child-friendly courts. As a result, police personnel ranking from Superintendents to Sub Inspectors have been trained on how to combat the crime and address the psycho-social needs of victims during and after rescue. In 2015, after the #ShameTheRapist campaign, the landlord gave an ultimatum to shift her Falaknuma, Hyderabad-based Economic Rehabilitation Unit. With limited time and resources available, Krishnan chose to crowdfund the funding gap required to relocate to her new facility. She crowdfunded over $225000 on crowdfunding platform called goCrowdera.com to bridge the funding gap and to build an Emergency Shelter for the rescued victims. Media outreach In 2009, Krishnan gave a speech during an official TED India conference about the cause of human trafficking at Infosys Campus, Mysore, which has since inspired over 2.5 million viewers globally. > \\"She brought the house down in Mysore today. And by that, I mean that she > broke hearts and moved people to action. The audience listened painfully to > some of the stories of the more than 3,200 girls she has rescued, girls who > had endured unimaginable torture and yet, somehow, nevertheless found the > will to heal and thrive‚Ä¶ Her strong voice and powerful body language ensured > that no one could claim to have misunderstood her points.\\" Her July 2012 appearance on Aamir Khan‚Äôs television show Satyamev Jayate was instrumental in not only garnering huge funds but also networking with business owners willing to provide job placements for survivors. She also appeared on test open at Open Heart with RK which reached out to millions of Telugu viewers across the world. In addition, Krishnan sensitized over 3,000 corporate houses through the INK and The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) conferences, which made a deep impact on the attendees. Film making Early in her career, Krishnan forayed into film making as a tool for advocacy. She conceptualized and scripted 14 documentary films on socially relevant issues such as youth and HIV/AIDS, Sheikh marriages, incest, prostitution, sex trafficking, communal riots, among others. Some of the films she has helped develop and co-produce include: * Mein Aur Meri Sanchaien (Hindi) * Needalu: An Insider‚Äôs view into the World‚Äôs Largest Criminal Enterprise * The Man, His Mission (20 mins, Hindi) * Bhagnagar (10 mins, Hindi) * On Freedom and Fear (30 mins, Telugu, English) * The Sacred Face * Me & Us (23 mins, English) * Astha ‚Äì An Ode to Life (25 mins, English) * A Chance to Live (25 mins, English) * Anamika‚ÄìThe Nameless (28 mins, Telugu, Hindi) * Building Bridges * Aparajita * Naa Bangaru Talli (4 National awards winning movie) The 2005 documentary Anamika‚ÄîThe Nameless won the AC award under \\"Best Foreign Award\\" category, Best Editing from Festival Cine de Granada and Best Documentary Film Award at the HIFF. Prajwala's shockingly vivid film The Sacred Face also broke the silence about the horrors of incest among high-level officials in Hyderabad. In January 2013, Ms. Krishnan in collaboration with Suntouch Productions launched a bilingual feature film on sex trafficking titled Ente in Malayalam and Naa Bangaaru Talli in Telugu. Naa Bangaru Talli has won 5 international awards in 2013, including Best Feature Film Award at Trinity International Film Festival, USA and Award of Excellence from IFFCRM, Indonesia. It then won 3 awards at the 61st National Film awards in New Delhi and was screened at the 4th Beijing International Film Festival, 2014. Research and publications In 2002, Krishnan and Bro Jose Vetticatil conducted an action research and publication of a document entitled The Shattered Innocence on inter-state trafficking from Andhra Pradesh to other states, revealing the reality and magnitude of the crime along with a demographic profile of vulnerable communities. Upon submitting this report to the government, a state-level consultation on the need for a multi-sectoral approach to address the issue emerged. Other books she has published include: * Caregiver's Manual on Sex Trafficking: A guide to creating a healing space to restore dignity for victims * From Despair to Hope: A Handbook for HIV/AIDS Counselors * Living Positively: A series of 8 resource guides for barefoot HIV counselors on community-based care & support * Handbook for Anti-Trafficking Partners of Andhra Pradesh: A State Resource Directory of Service Providers Threats and attacks Krishnan has been physically assaulted 14 times and she receives regular death threats. She says that a Sumo van once deliberately rammed her auto rickshaw, but she escaped serious injury. She was again fortunate to escape injury when acid was once flung at her. Good fortune saved her a third time when she was the target of a poisoning attempt. Krishnan says that these assaults have only steeled her resolve to carry on her crusade against human trafficking. In 2012, an RTI activist led an attack on one of Prajwala's transition centers in Kalapather. A mob of young Muslims with posters and printouts of Prajwala's website staged a dharna in front of its school. The media picked up the story, presenting one-sided information, insinuating that Prajwala had been defaming Muslim women in order to access foreign funds.

Lord Walker said although he \\"was one of those who gave permission for a further appeal (as it then was, to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords) I find, on closer consideration, that the case involves no issue of general public importance.\\"[2009] UKSC 2, [40] Facts Sigma Finance Corporation (Sigma) was a limited purpose finance company (similar but different from a structured investment vehicle (SIV)) established to invest in certain types of asset-backed securities and other financial instruments, and aimed to profit from the difference between the cost of funding its activities and the returns made on its investment portfolio. Its activities were much like a very simplified form of banking, although with less than half the leverage of a traditional bank and without any exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk. However, due to the impact on the financial markets stemming from the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States of America, on the value of asset backed securities generally, despite Sigma having no exposure to US subprime mortgages, there was a \\"run\\" by short term lenders to all non-banks. This resulted in forced selling by many investors at the same time causing the value of Sigma's assets to fall short of the amount it needed to pay the secured creditors. Following an auction in December 2008 the values achieved fell far short of the amounts required to satisfy the secured creditors, let alone the unsecured creditors. All of Sigma's assets were secured under a security trust deed (STD) in favour of those creditors investing in and through Sigma. The STD provided that in such an event there should be a 60-day realisation period during which the trustees should use Sigma's assets to create, as far as possible, two pools of funds relating to its short- and long-term liabilities. However, the final sentence in Clause 7.6 of the STD also provided that, \\"During the Realisation Period the Security Trustee shall so far as possible discharge on the due dates realisable or maturing Assets of the Issuer.\\" Various classes of creditors, both secured and unsecured, brought actions against Sigma and a dispute arose as to the correct application of the STD given that Sigma has insufficient funds to satisfy all of its creditors and had failed to meet a margin call. Certain creditors argued that the clause required Sigma's receivers to allocate assets to its short-term liabilities pari passu i.e. equally and without preference; other creditors argued that a ‚Äòpay as you go‚Äô approach should be adopted with assets allocated according to the dates on which liabilities fell due, starting with the earliest. Judgment High Court An application was made under Section 35 of the Insolvency Act 1986 asking for directions from the court as to how to progress. Mr Justice Sales held that the natural meaning of Clause 7.6 was that assets were to be distributed according to the dates when the relevant debts became due within the realisation period i.e. that the ‚Äòpay as you go‚Äô approach was the correct one. Court of Appeal By a majority of two to one (Lord Justice Lloyd and Lord Justice Rimer in the majority; Lord Neuberger dissenting), the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Mr Justice Sales and dismissed the appeals. Supreme Court By a majority of four to one, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal. The judgment of the majority (comprising Lords Mance, Hope, Scott and Collins) was given by Lord Mance with a further, brief judgment, given by Lord Collins. Lord Walker dissented. The leading judgment was given by Lord Mance, with whom Lords Hope, Scott and Collins concurred. The principles upon which the court should interpret such a document were held to be well-established and clear. The court should look at the document as a whole rather than focus on a single phrase, including any background information which would have been available to the parties at the time the contract was agreed. Applying this principle, it was held that the court should look not at the final sentence in Clause 7.6 in isolation but at the context in which the sentenced appeared and at the scheme of the STD as a whole. Clause 7.6 appeared in the STD in the context of an assumption of a situation in which Sigma had enough assets to cover at least its secured creditors, not a situation requiring the application of priorities between creditors. The final sentence of Clause 7.6, it was held, was not intended to prioritise creditors whose debts fell due during the realisation period over other creditors. It was also held to be improbable that commercial parties would contemplate that priority would be conferred to some creditors over others by the fortuitous timing of whose debts fell due during the realisation period. Clause 7.6 was an ancillary provision which did not override the trustee's absolute discretion as to how assets were to be realised. The reasonable person's understanding of Clause 7.6 was aided by a clear basic scheme that debts arising during the realisation period were to be part of the short term pool of creditors with the assets to be distributed equally amongst all the creditors at the discretion of the trustee i.e. pari passu. A further judgment was given by Lord Collins, with whom Lords Hope and Mance concurred. Lord Collins, in his brief judgment, offered further thoughts on the approach to interpretation. He warned against over-literal interpretation of one provision of a document without regard to the whole as risking distortion or frustration of a commercial purpose. Such an approach, which may be appropriate in interpreting tax legislation, was inappropriate in a commercial context. Detailed semantic analysis had to give way to business common sense. Lord Walker, dissenting, argued that the case involved no issue of general public importance. The principles of construction to be applied were clear and were neatly summarised in Lord Mance's judgment. Lord Walker preferred the view taken by the majority of the Court of appeal. However arbitrary or fortuitous it might appear to the court that priority would be given to creditors whose debts fell due during the realisation period, that was nonetheless the effect of the deed and the court should not make a new contract for experienced commercial operators as advised by expert lawyers.

This episode was originally aired January 18, 2002. The episode is narrated by Alix Spiegel, who was the recipient of the George Foster Peabody Award, the Livingston Award, and the Dupont Award. She won the 2002 Livingston Award in National Reporting for the 204th episode of This American Life, \\"81 Words\\". The program is hosted by Ira Glass, who gives the introduction for the episode stating, > \\"It's just uncanny, I think that's the word.

Today's radio program is about > something small like that, that was at the epicenter of massive social > change in our country for a brief moment.\\" This narrative tale falls into the category of healing narrative. It is the healing narrative of Dr. John Patrick Spiegel, Alix Spiegel's grandfather. Dr. John P. Spiegel was a psychiatrist and the former president of the American Psychiatric Association.  Summary  The episode is split into two acts. The first act explains that in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declared that homosexuality was not a disease, by changing the 81-word definition of sexual deviance in its own reference manual. It was a change that attracted a lot of attention at the time, but the story of what led up to that change is one that was reported by Spiegel. Part one of Spiegel's story details the activities of a closeted group of gay psychiatrists within the APA who met in secret and called themselves the GAYPA ... and another, even more secret group of gay psychiatrists among the political echelons of the APA. Spiegel's own grandfather was among these psychiatrists, and the president- elect of the APA at the time of the change. Alix Spiegel states in the beginning of the story that, \\"...I know this story not because I read it in a book or learned it in any class, but because it's one of those stories that my family uses to explain itself.\\" The story begins with a recording of John P. Spiegel interviewing himself in which he talks about how he has been asked to travel to Ireland to work with a gay activist who is trying to change the Irish constitution. Spiegel was asked to testify as an expert in mental health. Dr. Spiegel was asked to testify about the mental health of homosexuals. Oddly enough he was a homosexual who had not told anyone. He was asked to do this because he was the president elect of the American Psychiatric Association in 1973. It stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that homosexuality was termed sexual deviance and that homosexuals were pathological.Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Merikangas KR, Walters EE (June 2005). \\"Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of Sexual Deviance DSM disorders\\". Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 62 (6): 617‚Äì27. This gave the country the right to treat homosexuals differently.Stuart H (September 2006). \\"Mental illness and employment discrimination\\". Curr Opin Psychiatry 19 (5): 522‚Äì6. Alix Spiegel's family had always told the story of Dr. Spiegel as one that expressed him as the sole person to abolish the 81 word definition of homosexuality from the DSM, until a family vacation after Dr. Spiegel's wife had died, when he emerged from a beach bungalow with a much younger man that was later introduced to a shocked family as his lover. The second act of the radio program explains the history of homosexuality in psychological terms and gives the conclusion to the story. At the same time that Dr. Spiegel is working in Ireland, a few gay activists began to make protests to try to get the designation of homosexuality changed. The story from this point gives a history of homosexuality, from its original state as a crime against the will of God, to it being a form of insanity, then stating it was just faulty wiring. The story continues by talking about Dr. Irving Bieber, who started doing a lot of tests with homosexuals. Dr. Bieber tried to find the cause for homosexuality in a psychological sense. The story continues to talk about the group of gay activists that worked inside of the APA, that had a large part to do with the changing of the 81 word definition. The GAYPA worked in the APA to get Dr. Robert Spitzer (the head of the APA) to rewrite the 81 word definition. The story ends with Dr. John P. Spiegel, president- elect of the APA, accepting the new definition of homosexuality. See also *John E.

Description It reaches up to 45 cm (18 in) long including the tail, and has a flattened body with small, smooth, granular scales and slightly keeled scales near the tail. The head is bluish with red to orange colors around the eyes, yellow neck with blue spots and streaks. The back of the tail is gray blue with darker cross bars. The coloration intensifies during the breeding season in both sexes. Behavior It prefers temperatures in excess of 90 ¬∞F and basks in direct sunlight on desert rocks. A very wary species, its flattened body allows it to quickly retreat into rock crevices to escape predators as well as inclement weather conditions. When threatened, it can extend a skin flap along its throat. Like many lizards, it is able to drop its tail when caught. Diet It feeds on various insects, small lizards, blossoms, leaves, seeds, and small fruit. Occasional incidents of cannibalism on smaller individuals have been observed. Taxonomy Two subspecies are recognized within P. thalassinus; P. t. thalassinus inhabits the Cape region, and P. t. repens ranges north of the isthmus of La Paz. P. t. repens differs by having a thin, black, postorbital stripe; one row of scales between the nasal and the supralabials as opposed to two, and reaching a maximum snout-to-vent length of 111 mm as opposed to 162 mm. Genetic studies indicate all populations within P. thalassinus, including the two subspecies, show only low levels of genetic divergence, indicative of high rates of gene flow. In contrast, P. thalassinus is strongly differentiated from its sister species P. mearnsi. Life History Breeding takes place in the spring. 20 to 30 eggs are laid in late spring and summer, and hatchlings appear after 85 to 88 days in summer and early fall. Sexual maturity is reached after about 2 years with a life expectancy of 20 years. Habitat P. thalassinus is most often found in the immediate vicinity of rocky canyons, boulder-strewn hillsides and arroyo bottoms and sea-side cliffs. These lizards appear to be particularly common on rocks near large trees or other vegetation, and rarely seen in areas where vegetation is non-existent. Geographic range Petrosaurus thalassinus It is found in the Sierra la Laguna (and its associated ranges) and Sierra la Trinidad of the Cape region of Baja California Sur, as well as on Islas Espiritu Santo and Partida Sur in the Gulf. Elevational distribution from sea level to 2,020 meters in the Sierra la Laguna. Conservation This species is locally abundant and occurs on several protected islands. It is currently in no need of special protection. However, its small range may make it vulnerable to disturbance.

VESV affects only pigs and marine mammals. It is not transmissible to humans. VESV is only a concern among Californian pig-farmers; otherwise, the disease is now, by and large, a historical curiosity. It was globally eradicated in swine in 1959.Vesicular Exanthema‚ÄîPig expert reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 10 October 2011. Source of virus Viruses that are virtually identical to VESV are present in marine mammals and fish along the Pacific coast of the United States. These viruses are sometimes called San Miguel Sea Lion Virus. It is therefore assumed that the source of VESV was waste seafood fed to pigs or as garbage finding its way to pigs from farmed mink that were fed seafood. History VESV was first diagnosed in pigs in Southern California in 1932. Because of its close similarity to FMD, all the pigs were destroyed. It kept reappearing in California from time to time, with the pigs being slaughtered each time. Then, in 1952, the virus escaped from California in a trainload of infected pork. Garbage-fed pig herds came down with the disease, and it spread from them to neighboring herds until herds in 43 states were affected. It was eventually stamped out in 1956 by a major slaughter policy combined with a ban on feeding uncooked garbage to pigs. It was declared an exotic disease in the United States in 1959. The only cases outside the United States were in slaughter pigs on ships from the U.S. bound for Hawaii in 1947 and in pigs fed uncooked pork scraps from an American military base in Iceland in 1955. The source of the virus remained a mystery until 1972, when an essentially similar virus, the San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV) was isolated from San Miguel Island sea lions. When inoculated experimentally into pigs, it caused typical signs of VESV. Transmission Once established within a herd, transmission from pig to pig is by direct contact. Initiation of new outbreaks starts by feeding infected uncooked pork scraps. Symptoms Symptoms are very similar to FMD and include: * Fever up to . * Vesicles on the epithelium of the snout, lips, nostrils, tongue, feet and mammary glands. * Epithelial lesions identical to the other vesicular diseases. * No systemic lesions. Mortality is low, but there may be some deaths in suckling piglets. Growing pigs may become debilitated. Diagnosis Diagnosis requires laboratory tests. Serological methods such as complement fixation, serum neutralization and PCR are available. Virology Virions consist of a capsid. Virus capsid is not enveloped, round with icosahedral symmetry. The isometric capsid has a diameter of 35‚Äì39 nm. Capsids appear round to hexagonal in outline. The capsid surface structure reveals a regular pattern with distinctive features. The capsomer arrangement is clearly visible. Capsid with 32 cup-shaped depressions. Under in vitro conditions, virions are inactivated in acid environment of pH 3‚Äì5. The genome is not segmented and contains a single molecule of linear positive-sense, single- stranded RNA. Minor species of non-genomic nucleic acid are also found in virions. The complete genome is 7900 nucleotides long. The 5'-end of the genome has a viral protein genome-linked (VPg). The 3'-terminus has a poly (A) tract. The genome encodes viral structural proteins. Lipids are not reported. By itself, the genomic nucleic acid is infectious. Management control and prevention No vaccines are available. The cooked garbage policy in the United States should prevent its reappearance. Pigs should not be fed waste seafood.

Biography He was born on September 11, 1904, in Krak√≥w, Poland to a prominent Jewish family. He studied for a degree in medicine at the Jagiellonian University. He escaped from occupied Poland in 1940 soon after the 1939 Nazi invasion and travelled to the United States, ultimately serving in the United States Armed Forces during World War II. After the war, he joined other scientists (notably Rosalyn Yalow, recipient of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology) in the \\"Golden Age\\" of research at the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center, becoming director of the Cancer Research Division. One story claims that this appointment allowed him to move his research mice from the trunk of his car, where he had been carrying out studies, into a fully equipped laboratory. He died at Montefiore Medical Center on July 19, 1999 of stomach cancer at age 94. Research work Gross was a major proponent of the possibility that some cancers can be caused by viruses and began a long search for viral causes of murine leukemia. In the course of these studies, he isolated the Gross murine leukemia virus strain as well as the first polyomavirus, so named for its proclivity to cause cancers in multiple tissue types. Gross murine leukemia virus is a retrovirus whose counterpart in humans is human T cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I), while murine polyomavirus is closely related to the human Merkel cell polyomavirus that causes most forms of Merkel cell carcinoma.

He held this position since Novozymes was founded in a demerger from Novo Nordisk in 2000 and left the company in 2013 when Peder Holk Nielsen stepped up as CEO.  Early life and education  Steen Riisgaard was educated at the University of Copenhagen and holds an MSc in Microbiology from 1979. Protecting nature and the environment was a priority early on and Steen Riisgaard founded a local branch of the environmental organization Noah (Friends of the Earth, Denmark) in Ballerup, Denmark.  Career  Riisgaard started his career as a research fellow at the Serum Institute of Denmark and a research microbiologist at Foss Electric, Denmark. In 1979, he joined Novo Nordisk in Enzymes Research & Development. In 1982 he moved to Tokyo to start up an Enzymes Research & Development unit in the Novo Nordisk subsidiary Novo Industri Japan Ltd. After his return to Denmark in 1985, he held a range of jobs in the company before he was promoted to Corporate Executive Vice President with special responsibility for Enzyme Business in 1989. When Novozymes was spun off from Novo Nordisk in a demerger in 2000, Riisgaard was made President and CEO of the new company. He has held this position since then. Riisgaard has stated that an important motivation for working in Novozymes is the company‚Äôs positive impact on the environment: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy that my job isn‚Äôt only about making money (‚Ä¶) the more products we sell, the more enzymes we develop, the cleaner the world becomes‚Äù. Riisgaard is Chairman of WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) Denmark, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Egmont Group and Rockwool International A/S, and he serves on the Board of EuropaBio.  Biofuels and ‚Äòthe bio-based society‚Äô  Riisgaard has been vocal in his support for advanced biofuels (for which Novozymes produces the essential enzymes) and called for politicians to support the industry with credit lines and loan guarantees. Steen Riisgaard has repeatedly stated that Novozymes would be ready in 2010 with the enzymes necessary to convert agricultural waste to fuel at a price level competitive with gasoline, and on February 16, 2010, he announced that the enzymes were ready. According to Steen Riisgaard, biofuels are the first step on the way to a ‚Äòbio-based society‚Äô in which ‚Äúsugar will be the new oil‚Äù and ‚Äúthe basis for an entire new chemicals industry‚Äù. In the bio-based society, traditional oil-based technology, products and infrastructure will be replaced by biotechnology and renewable raw materials input: \\"Riisgaard [...] says he imagines a future in which bio-refineries are dotted around the countryside producing fuels and other chemicals from biomass such as agricultural waste. [...] Riisgaard reckons that converting agricultural waste into other chemicals (including fuels) using industrial biotechnology could replace 20-25% of global oil consumption.\\" In January 2008, Novozymes announced a partnership with US agriculture giant Cargill to produce acrylic acid from renewable raw materials and in December 2009 the company announced a partnership with Brazilian petrochemical company Braskem to make polypropylene from sugarcane.

In 2010‚Äì11 he competed in La Liga, with Real Sociedad.

He spent six seasons with the main squad, always in that level. Eibar In June 2008, Sutil moved to SD Eibar in Segunda Divisi√≥n. His debut as a professional took place on 3 September, starting in a 0‚Äì1 defeat at CD Castell√≥n for the second round of the Copa del Rey; ten days later he played his first league game, coming on as a half-time substitute for Josu Etxaniz as the team fell 0‚Äì2 away to SD Huesca.

Charcoak (private collection). Eug√®ne Lavieille (November 29, 1820 in Paris ‚Äì January 8, 1889 in Paris) was a French painter. Biography His father was a tapestry maker and he was the younger brother of Jacques Adrien Lavieille (1818‚Äì1862), who became a famous wood-engraver. Eug√®ne Lavieille began to work as a decorator painter but was drawn to painting. In 1841 he was accepted at the workshop of Corot becoming one of his better, more faithful disciples and later a friend. Eug√®ne Lavieille soon devoted himself solely to painting despite financial difficulties and becoming a family man, marrying his first wife in 1847 (she died in 1848 soon after the birth of their son Adrien) and his second in 1852. A nature lover, Eug√®ne Lavieile painted outdoors whatever the weather. Frequent subjects of his paintings included trees, forests, fields, pools, farms, hamlet streets, riversides, ships on the strand and the flat coasts around Berck and some sites such as the ch√¢teau de Pierrefonds (Oise), or La Fert√©-Milon. He evoked the quotidian life in the country, peasants in the fields, or conducting droves, cows grazing or crossing a ford, hinds or roe-deers in the woods. He painted during winter, or during the night. So, he will be considered by somebodies as a painter of the mournful heavens and of the snow, because he had a remarkable talent for expressing the atmosphere of December and January, the spoiled trees, the grey heavens and the so particular lights of that period of the year, ‚Äì and a painter of the nights, because he reproduced so strikingly their lights. However, he painted also the spring time, the flowered trees, the blue and clear heavens with lights clouds. In fact, his palette was very large, and very various, evolving during the years, and his paintings can be very luminous. It is also necessary to consider his drawings, with a great quality, a great surety of dashes, realized with a lot of delicacy. Paysage de neige. Oil painting, 1871 (private collection). Around 1847, Eug√®ne Lavieille painted with the Groupe de L'Isle-Adam. In 1852, he went for inhabit in Barbizon, where he lived about 4 years, and participated to the fruitful √âcole de Barbizon. Later, he painted in La Fert√©-Milon, and its surroundings, where he lived from 1856 to 1859 (and where he returned), Ville d'Avray, in the Perche in Normandy, on the Basque coast, in Seine-et-Marne near Moret-sur-Loing and at the end of his life in Courpalay. He painted also in Montmartre, as soon as 1848, and where he returned and settled him. He had narrow contacts with the painters of his time : aside from Corot, with Millet, Rousseau, Daubigny, Diaz de la Pena, Troyon, Dupr√©, Ziem, Chintreuil, L√©on Brunel-Rocque, Fr√©d√©ric Henriet, Daumier, but also with the photographers Nadar and Carjat, who both realized a portrait of him, the man of letters Charles Asselineau‚Ä¶ La Chasse. Oil painting (private collection). His first participation to the Salon was in 1844. Afterward, he will participate to many Salons, or expositions, notably in different cities of France. Many of his paintings were bought by the administration or collectivities, during his life or later, and, now, are in museums of the R√©gion parisienne or in the French province (Marseille, Lille, Moulins, Dijon, Nantes, Melun, Gu√©ret, Alen√ßon, Rouen, Grenoble), or in other countries (Cambridge, Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City). Art critics as Baudelaire or Th√©ophile Gautier were very interested by him, and he was more and more recognized. So, he was decorated as chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1878, after the exposition of La nuit √† La Celle-sous-Moret, a painting which will be bought by the administration, and is in the museum of Melun. He lived by means of the sales of his paintings, particularly sales organized by himself. However, he will pay with his health to have painting outside whatever the weather, and his difficult conditions of life. He died only 69 years old. At that moment, there was still more than 200 paintings in his workshop, just a part of his work, which was very vast‚Ä¶ His vocation of painter was continued by his son Adrien Lavieille, a landscape painter as him, and his daughter Marie Ernestine, born in 1852 (and who in 1878 get married with the sculptor Charles Georges Ferville-Suan), later by his granddaughter Andr√©e Lavieille.

Gemma is the widow of John Teller, wife of Clay Morrow and mother of Jax Teller. She is unapologetic about the lengths she'll go to in order to protect the club, and is beloved by all of its members.  Biography  Gemma was born September 15, 1957 to Nate and Rose and is a native of Charming, California; her maiden name is Madock. According to Sheriff Wayne Unser, she left Charming when she was sixteen and returned \\"ten years later with a baby and a motorcycle club\\". She married John Teller, a Vietnam War veteran and founder of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, with whom she had two children: Jackson in 1978 and Thomas in 1984. Gemma has a scar on her chest which is explained when her grandson Abel has surgery. Gemma has a genetic heart disorder from her mother's side which she passed on to her children‚ÄîThomas died in 1990 from complications of the disorder, and Abel nearly died from heart complications after his premature birth. After John was hit by a semi-truck and died in 1993, she quickly married John's friend Clay Morrow. Sons of Anarchy =Season 1= Gemma Teller Morrow is the queen of Charming and the matriarch of the Sons of Anarchy. A Machiavellian schemer and expert in psychological manipulation, Gemma is extremely protective of her son and grandson, and she longs for the day when Jax will, in her eyes, be ready to assume control over SAMCRO to ensure the organization's survival for another generation. She adores her husband, Clay, and does her best to make things work out his way. Many of SAMCRO's plans succeed because of Gemma's quiet intervention (e.g., finding out who raped the little girl at the carnival in the episode \\"Fun Town,\\" and surveillance of L.O.A.N. in season two). She generally has a hostile attitude toward all of Jax's female friends and partners, including his ex-wife Wendy; his on-again, off-again girlfriend Tara (although Gemma later takes Tara under her wing); and the club \\"groupies\\" with whom he occasionally has sex. Her tough, but relatively classy, image includes hair highlights and a tattoo on her breast. Nord boss Ernest Darby has indicated that he had a prior romantic interest in her. She claims to be part Jewish \\"on the angry Russian side.\\" =Season 2= Early in season 2, Gemma is raped by Sons of Anarchy rival AJ Weston and two other unknown men wearing white masks. During the assault, Gemma is told to tell Clay that it will happen again if he does not end his dealings with minorities. Later, Gemma realizes Weston is one of her rapists, when she recognizes his tattoos. When her friend Unser finds her at the rape scene, Gemma demands that he not tell Clay or Jax about the rape so as not to play into AJ Weston and Ethan Zobelle's plans to get Clay and/or Jax to do something rash. Unser complies and further covers up the source of Gemma's injuries by crashing her car into a road divider and taking her to the hospital. The only other person whom Gemma confides in about the rape is Tara Knowles, Jax's girlfriend. Unser later realizes that Chief Deputy Hale is starting to become more involved with Zobelle and his people and tells Hale about Gemma's assault. This causes Hale to re-evaluate his dealing with Zobelle. The rape leaves Gemma with significant and visible emotional trauma, which causes problems in her marriage with Clay. She also feels somewhat paranoid that AJ might try to attack her again. Her paranoia is further compounded when someone from L.O.A.N. mails one of the rapists' white masks to her. When Gemma learns of Jax's plans to become a Nomad, she tells him that she knows about the book her first husband, Jax's father John Teller, had written. She tells Jax she believes John's death may not have been an accident, but rather a suicide. After asking Jax to reconsider his decision, she implores him to read a certain page in John's book, hoping it will give him guidance and perhaps change his mind. The book fails to make Jax decide to stay and when the vote needed to allow him to leave is taken, it passes. Upon learning that Jax still plans to become a Nomad, Gemma calls together her son, Tara, and husband Clay at her home and reveals, fairly graphically, the details of her assault and gang rape. As a result, Jax picks up the jacket patches he had removed from his vest after the vote, which indicates that Jax has decided to stay with SAMCRO. The following morning, feeling unwanted by Clay, Gemma comes on to an emotionally wrecked Tig, who reciprocates her advances, but stops when he sees a picture of Jax and Thomas at the beach as children. Later, Tig is guilt-ridden and proceeds to confess to Opie about Donna's murder. Then, outside the church where Unser's support group meets, Gemma is approached by the priest who runs the support group; he offers her advice to serve others in order to deal with her own self-loathing. Back at the garage, she runs into Chibs, who is distraught about his dealings with ATF agent Stahl. She comforts him and advises him to come clean with the club. After the club meeting, Tig tells Clay, at the end of the day, that Gemma thinks he does not want her anymore; Clay proceeds to the office and shows that he still wants Gemma. When the club goes on lock-down, Gemma looks after other families. She tells Tara she (Tara) does not have to take crap from anyone, because she is the old lady of the Vice President. Gemma has been teaching Tara, because she will one day be the queen of the club. Inspired by Gemma, Tara stands up to her supervisor at the hospital, assaulting her at one point when she calls Gemma a whore. In the second-season finale, Gemma happens to come across Polly Zobelle. Wanting to get revenge and also do her part for SAMCRO, she follows Polly to Edmond Hayes' house. She sends Tara home and sneaks onto the property, where she finds a distraught Polly brandishing a gun. Polly attempts to shoot, so Gemma kills her in self-defense. She then discovers Edmond Hayes' body and ATF Agent Stahl, saying that both of them had a bloody day. Stahl offers to let her leave, but not before tossing her sidearm to Gemma, who catches it. Gemma instantly realizes Stahl's trick to get her fingerprints on the murder weapon, and flees. At a bus stop payphone, she calls Police Chief Wayne Unser for help. She is last seen fleeing Charming with Unser with no idea where to go. =Season 3= Gemma is still on the run at the beginning of Season 3. Tig is keeping her at a motel until Clay and SAMCRO can figure out a way to clear her name. Clay elects not to tell Gemma that Abel has been kidnapped, because he believes she already has enough to worry about. While at the motel, Gemma reads her mother's obituary in a newspaper, which disturbs her. Gemma's poor relationship with her mother is reinforced when Opie gives Jax his condolences for the loss, and Jax dismisses it, stating that \\"he hardly knew her that well.\\" Eventually, Gemma convinces Tig to help her sneak away. They end up in Oregon, at the house of her father, a reverend who is suffering from late-stage Alzheimer's disease. After an incident involving Tig and the Guatemalan caretaker, which results in Tig's being shot, Gemma requests Tara's assistance. After the caretaker discovers that Gemma is wanted and that there is a hefty reward for her capture, Gemma ties her up in the basement of her father's home. Shortly thereafter, the caretaker escapes by overpowering Tara. The caretaker then attempts to overpower Gemma but is accidentally killed in struggle with Gemma and Tara. Soon, Gemma makes the hard decision to move her father into an assisted living home. Gemma then breaks down, escapes in Tara's car, and contacts Agent Stahl. Tara and Tig inform the club that Gemma has disappeared, and Jax realizes that she was heading home to be with Abel. However, upon returning home, Gemma discovers that Abel had been kidnapped. This aggravates her heart condition, and she ends up in the hospital. Gemma had made a deal to turn herself in to Stahl upon her return to Charming, in exchange for not receiving the death penalty for the murders of Edmund Hayes and Polly Zoebelle. However, Stahl reneges on the deal, informing Gemma that because she did not turn herself in at the agreed-upon time (because she was in the hospital), Gemma has violated the terms of the deal. Later, Jax secretly works out a deal with Stahl, wherein he will give Stahl information on the IRA and get her back in the good graces of the ATF, in exchange for help with his mother. (Stahl had been demoted and taken off the IRA case following the events at the end of season 2.) Stahl then supplies Jax with a statement for Gemma to give to the ATF, in which Gemma states the real events of the Hayes and Zoebelle shooting, except that Gemma fingered another ATF agent for the Edmund Hayes shooting. In \\"Widening Gyre\\", Gemma finds out that John Teller had an affair in Belfast in the late 1980s, which produced a daughter. She makes up her mind to go to Belfast with Clay and Jax, and employs Tara's help in breaking out of police custody. After a tense standoff with Wayne Unser, Gemma successfully makes it to the airport with SAMCRO. Once she and SAMCRO arrive in Belfast, the Sons are in danger of being deported to America. When they are all in the van, Gemma forces a SAMBEL (Sons of Anarchy Belfast) member to run the police off the road. After SAMCRO's release from police custody, they head to the SAMBEL clubhouse, where Gemma meets Maureen and Trinity Ashby. Gemma and Maureen talk privately later, and Maureen tells Gemma they should continue to keep the secret about John's being Trinity's father. However, Jax and Trinity are attracted to each other, and Gemma tells him that Trinity is his sister, after finding them in a compromising position. The next day Gemma, Jax, and Opie go to the orphanage to get Abel. When they get there, they are under orders of Father Ashby, who tries to prevent them from taking Abel home by lying about knowing where Abel is. Gemma sees right through this, takes the baby hostage, and threatens to kill Ashby. When the Irish finally tell where Abel is, Gemma gives the baby back, and Jax goes to find him. When Jax returns without Abel, he tells his mother that neither he nor Abel belongs there, and Abel belongs with the other family. Gemma is enraged that Jax is willing to give up his own son and tells him Tara is pregnant. When father Ashby shows up, it is revealed that Sean Casey was tortured, and the priest tells them that Jimmy is now after Abel. Everyone, including Gemma, tries to get to the hotel to save Abel, only to find they are too late. After a deal is made between Jimmy and the True IRA, Abel returns home with his true family. Once back in Charming, the club is trying to find Tara, and Gemma is struggling with the deal Jax made with Stahl. Gemma knows it does not matter how much the rest of the club loves him; if they find out he is ratting, they will kill him without hesitation. Jax is still confident that nothing will go wrong and promises her that everything and everyone will be all right. Gemma, still afraid, decides to take Stahl at gunpoint and force to kill the deal, warning that if Stahl doesn't end the deal she will turn herself in and tell where her previous statement really came from. She later greets Tara and hugs her for her safe return from Salazar. In the season 3 finale, Gemma is still worried about the deal Jax made with Stahl. When she sees that the deal is still on, and Jax is giving up the head of the IRA, she tries to turn herself in, only to find out that it is too late, because Stahl already gave her statement clearing her of the killings. Gemma warns Stahl that someone will get hurt. When Clay comes to see Gemma in jail, she tells him they can't look at Jax the same way they saw John Teller, because club has been in desperate times. At the end, she sees Jax arrive with Stahl and watches with sadness as Stahl sets up Jax to die at the hands of his own club, by exposing the deal they made. But Gemma gets some relief after Jax sends her a letter explaining that he was never a rat; the deal was a trap the entire club was in on, and the only reason they didn't tell her was to keep her from being an accessory if things went awry. At the end, it is strongly insinuated, via a letter John wrote his mistress Maureen, that Gemma and Clay are responsible for John Teller's death. =Season 4= At the beginning of season four, we see Gemma is continuing her duties as the Queen of SAMCRO. She is one of the first people, along with Tara, to welcome home the members of SAMCRO who had been in prison for fourteen months. She later visits Unser, who has sold his business and moved into a trailer in the woods. After she and Clay have sex to properly welcome him home, she tells him that Unser needs him and the club to go on living. Gemma later attends Opie's wedding. After the wedding, she goes to Jax's house to check on the boys and she finds a note that suggest Maureen Ashby gave John Teller's letter to Jax to read. The next day she tells Clay about what she found and he tells her not to worry about it. Later she discovers that Jax hadn't read them, but Tara has. She tells Tara that the letters will only hurt their family. But more piles on when Piney tells her about wanting the club to mule drugs. When she confronts Clay and tries to order him not to do it, he makes her know that she is not the boss of him. When the club goes to Tucson for the drug run, she confronts Piney about his beef with Clay and tells him to let it go before he gets himself killed, but he won't back down. In the next episode, Clay tells Gemma about the confrontation with Piney were Piney tells Clay he knows the truth about John Teller's death. She not only worries about the truth coming out, but also about Clay when he suggests killing Tara and Piney as they are they only other two people who know the truth. She talks him out of it. She later goes to Unser who she tells to get the letters as he too was involved in the murder of John by helping cover it up. Later, she goes to get the letters and discovers that Unser burned them. She shows the ashes to Clay, unaware that he read them. Later in the season, Gemma discovers Piney's dead body and immediately knows it was Clay who killed him. She learns from Unser that Clay not only read the letters, but the ones he read were actually copies meaning Tara still has the originals. Unser wants to turn Clay in, but Gemma convinces him otherwise. Later she and Clay talk about the situation and she tells him that they will simply add Piney's death to their list of secrets and she will convince Tara to give her the letters. She makes Clay promise her that he will not hurt Tara. The next day, Gemma sees Clay take money out of their safe and hours later someone tries to kidnap Tara. When Gemma confronts Clay, they end up fighting leaving Gemma badly beaten. Afterwards, Gemma realizes that Clay is beyond salvation and he has to die at the hand of the son. The next day, she learns that Jax and Tara are planning to leave SAMCRO and Charming. She also discovers that Wendy has returned and wants to be a part of Abel's life and confronts her. When Unser tells Opie what happened to Piney to get Opie to kill Clay she tells him to try to stop it, because she wants Jax to do it. Unser is unable to stop it and Clay ends up shot by Opie, but he survived. Gemma then convinces Tara to give her the letters. Once she has them she takes out the ones that implicates her and Unser and gives the rest to Jax. She tells Jax everything that Clay has done and then tells Jax to kill Clay and take his place at the head of the table as the President of SAMCRO. While Jax is reading the letters, Gemma and Tara talk and Tara lets her that she knew about Gemma's plan to keep them in Charming. When Jax comes out after reading the letters Tara gives Jax a way to kill Clay and tells him that once it is done to come take her and their sons out of Charming. He promises that he will. Gemma is forced to watch her plan to have Jax become the next president fall apart. When she asks what Tara is doing, Tara tells her everything Gemma taught her. Tara then tells Gemma that Jax is hers. The same day Gemma sees Jax in the hospital coming out of Clay's room and tries to beg him to stay and Jax tells her that he is not leaving and that Clay won't hurt her again. When she goes into the room she sees that Clay is still alive. Later, Gemma burns the letters that implicate her in John's death and when the men are having church she sees Jax at the head of the table and Tara standing behind him. =Season 5= Gemma is now very independent from Clay as she is seen having sex with Nero Padilla in the very first scene, but it was later revealed that she had been consuming a great deal of alcohol and drugs, did not recall a thing from the previous night, tried to shoot Nero upon waking and had even given him a fake name. Later they officially introduce each other and she gives him her phone number. Once she arrives at her home she catches Clay digging through her belongings, claiming to be looking for a ring, then he asks for a moment of Gemma's time and after hearing him out, he tries to touch her and she drops him to the floor warning that he will never lay a hand on her again. She later organizes for SAMCRO to stay at Nero's day spa while they hide from the law in order to stop them from being alone and unprotected in prison, much against Tara's wishes, despite both Gemma and Jax explaining that if they were to go to prison they would most likely be attacked, if not killed. Clay, who still has feeling for her, comes over to pay Nero a visit; when Gemma arrives and sees Clay with an escort, she fights her. As a result, the police raid the brothel and gets everyone arrested. During the time Gemma is separated from Clay, she goes out and gets drunk and does drugs, one time, when Jax and Tara decide to go to the cabin to be alone, Jax insists that Gemma keep the boys, she agrees to do so, when she is driving, she drives under the influence of Marijuana and her vehicle goes off the road, injuring Abel in the process. When Jax and Tara hear the news, Tara believes that Gemma was driving stoned, but Clay lies saying that she was attacked instead. When Jax gets to the truth, he now knows that Gemma was driving stoned, as a result, they cut her out of their lives for good. However, Jax gives her a chance to get back into their lives by making her get back with Clay so he could get him to confess about a series of home invasions that he could possibly be behind to set up SAMCRO; Gemma is hesitant to go along with the idea but agrees to it, it also means shutting out Nero as well. Gemma's efforts to get Clay to confess seem worthwhile, after Clay confesses to SAMCRO that he was indeed behind the break ins, he is banished from SAMCRO once and for all, IRA boss, Galen O'Shay offers Clay to go to Belfast to oversee business deals for the true IRA, but on the condition that Gemma goes. Gemma slightly agrees to go along. As they are ready to leave, the police show up and arrest Clay for murdering Damon Pope, Gemma lies saying he went somewhere. =Season 6= When Gemma finds out Tara took Abel and Thomas, she thinks she went to the feds to make a deal, in truth, Jax surrenders himself over so Tara can be clear of the murder of Pam Toric. Gemma, in a fit of rage, kills her while Juice kills Eli Roosevelt to cover up the deed. =Season 7= Gemma continues to feel guilt over killing Tara, she hides Juice from the club. While alone, she talks to herself as if she is having a conversation with Tara. When Jax is set free, she says that it was the Chinese that killed Tara, Jax starts an all out war with Henry Lin while Gemma continues to feed Jax lies. Abel is having difficulty with Tara's death, he overhears Gemma tell Thomas that she was sorry for killing her, he begins cutting himself as a result, when child services find out about the cuts, he says Gemma did it. Jax learns from Abel that Gemma killed Tara. Jax goes to Juice and gets the full truth about what happened. Gemma goes to her family home in Oregon. Wayne goes to Oregon to bring Gemma back. Jax arrives in Oregon and kills them both.

It was established on June 30, 2004http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000622485&dateTexte;= under the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin. This law states that each year an employee must work seven hours for free for one of his or her employers, and that each year the employer has to pay a specific contribution. The contribution is defined by another law Code de l'action sociale et des familles Partie l√©gislative Livre Ier : Dispositions g√©n√©rales Titre IV : Institutions Chapitre X : Caisse nationale de solidarit√© pour l'autonomie. at a rate of 0.3 percent to be paid to the ad hoc Caisse nationale de solidarit√© pour l'autonomie by the employers (0.3 percent is considered to be the approximate value of this seven hours' work). Its effect is the removal of a day's holiday. The implementation of this new kind of 'worked holiday' has been complicated, and has led to some controversy over its implications for social rights. Initial goal Adopted after the 2003 heatwave caused the death of nearly 15,000 people, the revenue from the law is intended to finance actions in favor of elderly people, especially to prevent risks due to excessive heat. Firms must pay one day's gross salary (without wage costs and social security contributions) for each employee to the State. Estimated figures led to discussion as to the scheme's productivity, which Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin judged satisfactory. On June 1, 2006, he said that benefits from the day (scheme) had been \\"incalculable\\". Principle The employer pays exactly 0.3 percent of employees' gross salary, which is included in employer wage costs. This amount is almost equivalent to one day of net salary. The employer does not have wage costs to pay for that working holiday (because there is no net salary for that day). Thus it results in the employer paying only half the usual rate for one working day and benefits from that day. Over the course of a year, this day is almost equal to (considering a rate of 50 percent for employer wage costs): *an increase of 0.44 percent for working hours for the employee, i.e., a decrease of 0.43 percent for hourly wage; *a decrease of nearly 0.23 percent of hour wage costs for the employer. The difference between the two rates (0.43 and 0.23), about 0.20 percent of hourly costs including wage costs, is passed to the State.

From 2004 to 2008, Pentecost Monday was worked by numerous employees. Pentecost Monday is still a holiday (but a working holiday). This was confirmed by the French Council of State on May 3, 2005. Many people, especially from the Collectif des Amis du Lundi (CAL) activist organisation are against this law which re-establishes in France one mandatory unpaid work day. The French Council of State was consulted over the constitutional position but did not consider the law illegal. Employer unions' points of view: *the Mouvement des entreprises de France is in favour of working on this day. In 2006, Laurence Parisot said that working this Monday is \\"very good\\". She feels that the government is giving \\"a bad example\\" by closing schools and post offices on this day. *The Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale des petites et moyennes entreprise states that the day \\"will create inequalities between administrations, big companies on one side, and SME/VSB on the other side. Contrary to the former, the latter will not be able to pay the contribution and offer this day to their employees. Employee unions' point of view: *Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Travailleurs Chr√©tiens says that \\"working without wage is equivalent to mandatory or forced work\\". *CFDT: \\"There will be strikes by salaried workers who refuse to work on this day. And they are right to oppose it,\\" says Fran√ßois Ch√©r√®que, because these are \\"mostly employees of small companies and retailers\\" who will work, whereas \\"in many places, big companies and administrations, they have been able to negotiate to keep this holiday a non-working holiday.\\" See also *Labour law *French Vignette (road tax) References Category:French culture Category:2004 introductions ","title":"Journ√©e de solidarit√© envers les personnes √¢g√©es"},{"id":"24973874","text":"Dniprovahonmash () is a rail freight rolling stock manufacturer based in Ukraine.

The response is described here by the relative movement of the mass of this system in relation to its support. The x-axis refers to the natural frequency and the y-axis to the highest peak multiplied by the square of the quantity (2 œÄ x natural frequency), by analogy with the relative displacement shock response spectrum. The severity of a vibration can be evaluated by calculating the stresses on a mathematical or finite element model of the structure and, for example, comparison with the ultimate stress of the material. This is the method used to dimension the structure. Generally, however, the problem is instead to evaluate the relative severity of several vibrations (vibrations measured in the real environment, measured vibrations with respect to standards, establishment of a specification etc.). This comparison would be difficult to carry out if one used a fine model of the structure and besides, this is not always available, in particular at the stage of the development of the specification of dimensioning. A solution consists of applying the vibration under consideration to a ‚Äústandard‚Äù mechanical system, which thus does not claim to be a model of the real structure, composed of a support and N linear one-degree-of-freedom resonators, each one comprising a mass, a spring and a damping device. A vibration A is considered as more severe than a vibration B if it produces a highest relative displacement (i.e. a highest stress) on this SDOF system than the vibration B. An ERS is generated from a vibration signal using the following process: 1\\\\. Choose a damping ratio for the ERS to be based on; 2\\\\. Assume a hypothetical Single Degree of Freedom System, with a given natural frequency (Hz); 3\\\\. Calculate (by time base simulation or from a Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the vibratory signal) the highest instantaneous relative displacement experienced by the mass element of this SDOFs at any time during exposure to the vibration in question. Plot this value multiplied by the square of (2 œÄ x natural frequency) against the natural frequency of the hypothetical system; 4\\\\. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other values of the natural frequency. The resulting plot is called an Extreme response spectrum. Note Vibrations can damage a mechanical system as a result of several processes, among which are: * the exceeding of characteristic instantaneous stress limits (yield stress, ultimate stress etc.) * the damage by fatigue following the application of a large number of cycles. ERS is used according to the first criterion. The second is considered with the fatigue damage spectrum (FDS). References * Lalanne, C., Mechanical Vibration and Shock Analysis.

Founded in 1946 as a local private initiative, it was first known as Vestjysk Musikkonservatorium. In 1972, it was taken over by the national authorities. Since 1998, it has been located in the refurbished and modernized premises of a former power plant built in 1907. (in Danish) In January 2010, the Esbjerg conservatory was merged with two other Danish institutions: the conservatory in Odense (formerly known as the Det Fynske Musikkonservatorium/The Carl Nielsen Academy of Music, Odense), and the acting school in Odense (formerly known as Skuespillerskolen ved Odense Teater). As a result, the Vestjysk Musikkonservatorium/The Academy of Music and Music Communication became the Esbjerg branch of the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Southern Denmark (AMDA). As a result of its excellent acoustics, the conservatory's concert hall (once the power station's turbine hall) with seating for 198 is considered to be one of Europe's best venues for chamber music. The complex also provides facilities for conferences and meetings which are used by a variety of cultural institutions and collaborators.
